## [[Leo Yu]] messages and updates 
Thanks for waiting patiently. I have added the following toÂ [!Course Materials](https://hkbuhk-my.sharepoint.com/personal/leoyu_hkbu_edu_hk/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?CT=1756822749659&OR=OWA%2DNT%2DMail&CID=0ba1a07d%2Dac31%2D6a21%2Dd82e%2Dcfd817367ed7&csf=1&web=1&e=igs1Nc&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fleoyu%5Fhkbu%5Fedu%5Fhk%2FDocuments%2FUE1%20%282526a%29%2FCourse%20Materials&FolderCTID=0x012000BAC95CD863B90448BDC138608E1E1A3F&view=0)

**1. Referencing Quiz (+ 2 flipped classroom videos)**

  

- Details of the quiz, including the answers of 10 MC questions and 2 flipped video links, can be found in the document.Â Please do not circulate it with your students.Â However, you may discuss the answers with your students after the submission deadline (provided no make-up in your sections)
    

  

**2. Pre-course Writing**Â 

- 3 files: Instructions to students + submission guide + formatting guide
    
- Students are instructed to write "no more than 300 words" rather than specifying a range (e.g., 250â€“300 words) because
    

- (1) Some students may convey their ideas effectively in fewer than 250 words. A strict range could unnecessarily pressure them to add unncessary content;
    
- (2) A single upper limit (300 words) simplifies grading by directly penalising submissions that exceed it, avoiding setting another penalty (e.g., 330 words)
    

**3. Updated Course Information Sheet**

- Changes included:
    

- 1. Previous "Module 1a" has become "Module 1 Parts 1-4"Â  while "Module 1b" has become "Module 1 Part 5"
    
- 2. "In-class" is added to "Peer Evaluation on Argument Construction and Evaluation (Draft) (5%)", and in red to remind students that it is an in-class assessment.Â 
    
- 3. Moderation dates and modes are included in the Teacher's Copy
    

**4. Rubrics**

- The coloured version is for students (on Moodle) while the plain b/w version in Word allows you to adapt it for your own use.Â 
    
- Each rubric category on Moodle has a maximum of 20 scale points. Most categories (with a base of 20 raw points or higher) use whole-number increments (e.g., 1, 2, 3). However, categories with a base of 10 raw points or below allow half-point increments (e.g., 0.5, 1.5). This difference has minimal impact on scoring. For example, awarding 0.5 in a 30-point category (e.g., 'Argument Structure' in ACE Final) affects the final score by only 1.66% for that category. In contrast, the same 0.5 in a 10-point category (e.g., 'Citations & References') has a 5% impact.". I will explain this in the moderation meeting.Â 
    
- In each rubric category, the grade-to-raw-points conversion is pre-filled. However, the final box under the 'D or below' grade remains intentionally blank for manual entry. For example, in ACE Final's 'Argument Structure' category, you could enter '6' next to the pre-filled '12' point box. The same arrangement appears in some 'A/A-' categories available for manual entry.
    

**5. Moodle**

- 'All Sections' course room: releasedÂ 
    
- Individual Section course room: Pre-course writing assignment has been created in all 'Monday' sections. The setup for other sectioins will be done on Mon.Â 
    

**6. Mentimeter Activities for Module 1**

- Jonathan would like to share his activity "_Face recognition technology: (When) is it acceptable?_" under "Shared Templates". Please feel free to download it, if interested
    
- I've prepared a quiz "_Avoiding Plagiarism with Gen-AI Tools_" for Part 5 (see Teacher's Copy, pp.24-25). Please contact me to be added as a collaborator, if interested.
