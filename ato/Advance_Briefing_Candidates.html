<h1>ATO Position - Technical Test: Advance Briefing</h1>
<p><strong>Subject</strong>: ATO Position - Technical Test: Advance Briefing</p>
<p>Dear [Candidate Name],</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in the Assistant Technical Officer (Learning Tech Developer) position. As part of our selection process, we would like you to complete a technical test.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Test Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Date &amp; Time</strong>: [Date] at [Time]<br />
<strong>Location</strong>: [Computer Lab Location, HKBU]<br />
<strong>Duration</strong>: 2 hours (test) + 10 minutes (presentation) + Q&amp;A</p>
<hr />
<h2>Assignment Focus: Review and Remix</h2>
<p>We want to set clear expectations for this test. Your primary goal is to <strong>demonstrate a deep understanding of the existing code and how to optimize it</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Review</strong>: Analyze the architecture, code quality, and structure of the provided codebase.</li>
<li><strong>Remix</strong>: You are expected to "remix" the code. This means focusing on <strong>improving the existing architecture</strong> or optimizing performance/maintainability, rather than building extensive new features (like new pages) from scratch. A small functional change may be required to demonstrate your understanding, but the priority is on architectural insight.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>What to Expect</h2>
<p>During the test, you will:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Review the codebase</strong> using any tools you prefer.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze</strong> the overall structure and technical framework.</li>
<li><strong>Implement</strong> an optimization or minor enhancement to demonstrate your "remix".</li>
<li><strong>Prepare a 10-minute presentation</strong> covering:</li>
<li>Your analysis of the current structure.</li>
<li>Your proposed optimizations or architectural improvements.</li>
<li>A demo of your "remix" (the changes you made).</li>
<li>How you would explain these technical concepts to non-technical staff.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Hint</strong>: You are expected to use vibe coding tools such as AI agents in your IDE.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Test Environment &amp; Resources</h2>
<p><strong>⚠️ Important</strong>: Since our lab computers may not be pre-installed with your preferred development software, <strong>we strongly recommend bringing your own laptop</strong> with your development environment ready.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internet Access</strong>: ✅ Allowed</li>
<li><strong>Equipment</strong>: <strong>Bring your own laptop</strong> (highly recommended) or use lab computers (standard software only).</li>
<li><strong>Tools</strong>: Any code review tools, analysis tools, or development environments.</li>
<li><strong>WiFi</strong>: Provided at test location.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>You may prepare generic materials, frameworks, and code templates in advance to adapt to the task during the test.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Submission</h2>
<p>At the end of the 2-hour test, you must submit:
- A <strong>publicly accessible GitHub link</strong> containing your work
- <strong>Email</strong> the link to a designated panel member
- <strong>Contents cannot be updated</strong> after submission
- <strong>Only contents in your GitHub repository</strong> can be used during the presentation</p>
<hr />
<h2>What to Bring</h2>
<ul>
<li>Valid ID for lab access</li>
<li>Your laptop (recommended)</li>
<li>Any preferred tools or prepared materials</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>Important Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>You may present in Chinese if preferred</li>
