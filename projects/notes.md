========sth to remember =======

I'll write some to-do item or request; once it is done, please strike out and update progress

do not write too much; stay concise

there are tools here /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/operating you might use to access Google docs, slides and to call API to consult LLM

always write scripts in files not through termianls - the files should be placed in the operating folder for future use
