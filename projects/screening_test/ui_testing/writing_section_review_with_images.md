**Test Environment:** Platform UI Testing

## üìù Content Structure Issues

### Major Content Problems

#### 1. **Inconsistent Task Instructions**
- **Problem:** Two different versions of the writing prompt appear:
  - Version A: "Should personality test results be used in the hiring process?" 
  - Version B: "Personality test results should not be used in job applications"
- **Impact:** Creates confusion about the actual stance students should take
- **Recommendation:** Standardize to one clear prompt with explicit direction (argue FOR or AGAINST)

#### 2. **Missing Section Labels**
- **Current:** "Situation:" label only
- **Needed:** Add "Instructions:" label to separate contextual setup from task requirements
- **Benefit:** Clearer information hierarchy for students

#### 3. **Incomplete Audio Information**
- **Missing:** Duration of the full podcast
- **Current:** "You will listen to the full podcast" (no time specified)
- **Recommendation:** Add podcast duration (e.g., "You will listen to the 8-minute podcast")
- **Rationale:** Helps students manage their time effectively

#### 4. **Unusual Rubric Exposure**
- **Issue:** Detailed marking criteria (5+5+5 marks breakdown) visible to students during test
- **Industry Standard:** Rubrics typically kept internal for examiner use
- **Action Required:** Flag this for exam writing team (Rhett) - policy decision needed
- **Options:** 
  - Remove detailed rubric entirely
  - Provide simplified version focusing on expectations, not marks

## üé® Design & User Experience Issues

### Interface Problems Documented

#### 1. **Plain and Cluttered Instructions Page**

![Interface Layout Issues](image/bug_reports/1757423236717.png)

- **Current State:** Dense text blocks, poor visual hierarchy
- **Issues:**
  - No visual separation between different instruction types
  - Wall of text format reduces readability
  - Important elements not highlighted

#### 2. **Audio Player Placement**

![Audio Player Position](image/bug_reports/1757423380739.png)

- **Current:** Audio player positioned at bottom of page
- **Problem:** Not prominent enough for critical listening task
- **Recommendation:** 
  - Move to more prominent position (top-right or center)
  - Consider sticky/floating player that remains visible during scrolling
  - Add visual emphasis (border, highlighting)

#### 3. **Overall Interface Layout**

![Complete Interface View](image/bug_reports/1757423395164.png)

- **Current:** Instructions cramped on left side
- **Opportunity:** Use right panel for:
  - Timer display
  - Task checklist/progress
  - Key reminders
  - Audio controls
