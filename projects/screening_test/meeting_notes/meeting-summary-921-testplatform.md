# Meeting Summary: Test Platform Review (September 21, 2025)

## Meeting Overview
**Date:** September 21, 2025  
**Duration:** ~28 minutes  
**Participants:** Simon Wang  
**Purpose:** Testing and reviewing the screening test platform functionality across all sections (Listening, Writing, Speaking)

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Listening Section Issues

#### Content Inconsistencies
- **Audio Count Mismatch**: Instructions mention "two excerpts" but only one audio file is provided
- **Abrupt Audio Ending**: The first audio excerpt ends unnaturally without proper conclusion
- **Question Mapping**: Unclear which questions correspond to which audio segments

#### Technical Concerns
- **Navigation During Audio**: Students can navigate between questions while audio plays (this is intentional but needs clear communication)
- **Test Duration**: 10 minutes with only 5 questions (4 multiple choice, 1 summary) may be insufficient for proper student differentiation

#### Recommendations
- Clarify with programming consultant about adding second audio file
- Confirm question-to-audio mapping with exam paper writers
- Consider extending test duration or adding more questions

### 2. Writing Section Issues

#### Content Access Problems
- **Missing Reading Materials**: Instructions require students to reference reading passages, but these are not accessible during writing
- **Audio Length**: 8-minute podcast may be too long for a 40-minute writing test
- **Memory Dependency**: Students cannot reference previous reading materials, making the task unrealistic

#### Proposed Solutions
- Provide reading passages on paper during writing section
- Create note-taking space in reading section that transfers to writing
- Consider shortening the audio content

### 3. Speaking Section Issues

#### User Interface Problems
- **Font Size**: Text is too small given time constraints
- **Timer Inconsistencies**: Preparation timer present but countdown not clearly visible
- **Note-taking Support**: No space provided for preparation notes

#### Technical Edge Cases
- **Auto-stop Functionality**: Recording continues beyond 3-minute limit (should auto-stop)
- **Session Timeout**: No clear handling if students don't start recording promptly
- **Auto-save**: Unclear if recording saves automatically when time expires

#### Logistics Needs
- Provide paper and pencil for note-taking during preparation
- Clear instructions about timing and recording process

### 4. General Platform Issues

#### User Experience
- **Page Information**: Generic screening test information needs section-specific customization
- **Visual Appeal**: Current design is too plain and needs formatting improvements
- **Session Closure**: Poor logout experience - needs proper completion page with confirmation

#### Workflow Standardization
- **Exam Format**: Need standardized Markdown templates for exam writers
- **Content Transfer**: Current process of converting exam content to Markdown is labor-intensive
- **Training Materials**: Need comprehensive candidate manual with screenshots and instructions

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Content Team Coordination**
   - Resolve audio count discrepancy in listening section
   - Clarify question-to-audio segment mapping
   - Address reading material accessibility in writing section

2. **Technical Improvements**
   - Fix auto-stop functionality in speaking section
   - Improve timer visibility and countdown displays
   - Add proper session completion page

3. **User Interface Enhancements**
   - Increase font sizes in speaking section
   - Improve visual formatting across all sections
   - Customize section-specific instructions

### Medium-term Improvements
1. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive candidate manual (outline only initially)
   - Develop standardized workflow for exam content creation
   - Establish edge case testing protocols

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Focus on exceptional/edge cases rather than normal operations
   - Test auto-save and timeout scenarios
   - Validate all timing mechanisms

3. **Content Management**
   - Develop Markdown templates for exam writers
   - Streamline content transfer process
   - Establish quality assurance checkpoints

## Testing Philosophy
The meeting emphasized the importance of testing edge cases and exceptional scenarios rather than just normal operations. This includes:
- Student behavior variations (early/late starts, timeouts)
- Technical failures (auto-save, connectivity issues)
- Content accessibility problems
- User interface limitations under time pressure

## Follow-up Items
- Schedule follow-up meeting with programming consultant
- Coordinate with exam content writers on format requirements
- Begin drafting candidate manual outline
- Plan comprehensive edge case testing session
- Implement AI assessment module for writing evaluation
