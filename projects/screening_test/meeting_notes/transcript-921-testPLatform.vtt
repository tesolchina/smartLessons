1
00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:07.440
Simon Wang: Okay, so we are going to the listening part.

2
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:16.599
Simon Wang: And, at the beginning, there's the, chat headset and everything. So, there's the…

3
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.540
Simon Wang: Some information about the screening test for freshmen.

4
00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.520
Simon Wang: As you can see here.

5
00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:35.640
Simon Wang: So actually, this… this page needs to be revised a little bit, because…

6
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:49.369
Simon Wang: the information here should be more about the listening test. The reading test has already been finished, so we should say something like, now let's move on to the listening

7
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:58.270
Simon Wang: test, instead of, presenting this kind of generic information. So this is actually something we have to…

8
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:10.219
Simon Wang: raise and discuss, because actually all the page information here should be set by us, so we should be able to set it through Markdown file or whatever, so we need to,

9
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.069
Simon Wang: Look into that.

10
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:21.439
Simon Wang: And then… oh, actually, this is the listening session, so… so we need to think about how to… kind of redesigning the whole…

11
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:38.029
Simon Wang: Bang. I mean, I mean, the previous page is… maybe the two pages can be consolidated or something. Anyway, so, so that's one issue we need to discuss, so maybe you can take some screenshot and, you can, you can raise the, you know, take the notes that I, I was just talking about.

12
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:45.929
Simon Wang: Okay? So, but then here it said it… you will answer 5 questions, 4 multiple-choice questions.

13
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.239
Simon Wang: There's one audio recording…

14
00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:02.800
Simon Wang: So the listening test got a total of 10 minutes, with 5 questions, 4 multiple choice, and 1 close summary question.

15
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:21.479
Simon Wang: Well, I mean, one issue we may want to consider is that, it seems like 10 minutes is relatively short. Only 4 multiple-choice questions and one closed summary question is… it may be very difficult to dis…

16
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:29.479
Simon Wang: kind of differentiate the students, right? Because there's so many… so… such a small number of questions, so actually that's something we want to…

17
00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.810
Simon Wang: Discuss as well.

18
00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.019
Simon Wang: But other than that, it seems okay. I mean, the whole instruction we can review later.

19
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:49.280
Simon Wang: We might want to reformat it and make it, like, a little bit more, visually appealing, because right now it's a little bit plain. But anyway, so we get started here.

20
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.070
Simon Wang: There's a total of… Five questions.

21
00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:04.010
Simon Wang: And, there's the countdown, there's the 10-minute thing, and we can actually look at all the 5 questions here.

22
00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.709
Simon Wang: Which is no problem, but…

23
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.790
Simon Wang: We actually need to… actually, maybe we can just go ahead and try this.

24
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.739
Simon Wang: Because here, we don't know how long is the audio, but we can give it a try.

25
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:32.340
Simon Wang: See, here, there's some problem here, because here is that you will hear two excerpts from the podcast. Each recording will be played once.

26
00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.239
Simon Wang: But then,

27
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:49.709
Simon Wang: Previously, as… if you remember, it says there's only one, one excerpt, so actually, we need to, consider how to, you know, how to, how to, correct this.

28
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.480
Simon Wang: listening component.

29
00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.230
Simon Wang: situation.

30
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:06.169
Simon Wang: During your research on MBTI and job hunting, you came across a podcast on whether job seekers should include their MBTI on their resume.

31
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.570
Simon Wang: Now listen to excerpt 1.

32
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:27.609
Simon Wang: Today, we're, tackling something lots of you might be thinking about, especially early in your careers. It's this trend of considering, you know, personality tests, like Myers-Briggs, the MVPI,

33
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:43.930
Simon Wang: And whether to put those results on your job applications. You take these tests maybe for self-discovery, find them interesting, and then think, hey, maybe this helps me stand out. Especially when the job market feels crowded. Exactly. So the big question we're diving into is, is that actually a good idea?

34
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:57.790
Simon Wang: And, spoiler alert, it's… well, it's pretty nuanced. It definitely is. It touches on how we, you know, present ourselves professionally, how we communicate strengths, and maybe most importantly, what people doing the hiring actually care about.

35
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:11.880
Simon Wang: So maybe we should start with why someone, especially a recent grad, might even think about doing this. What's the perceived upside? Okay, yeah, let's unpack that. I mean, if you're just starting out, you want any edge you can get. You look around, see tons of applicants, maybe similar grades, similar majors, and you think.

36
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.059
Simon Wang: how do I show I'm different? And…

37
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:22.339
Simon Wang: putting down, say, INTJ might feel like a quick way to signal, hey, I'm strategic, or maybe ESFP, to say, I'm good with people.

38
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:41.760
Simon Wang: like a shorthand. Exactly. It feels like a shortcut to communicating your work style, or maybe how you approach problems, and there's this idea that it shows self-awareness, you know, that you thought about yourself, your strengths, weaknesses. Employers often say they value that. Right, it feels like you're being transparent, maybe even getting ahead of the game. Here's who I am, here's how I tick.

39
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.660
Simon Wang: And you sometimes hear that in certain places.

40
00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:56.639
Simon Wang: I think, particularly in parts of Asia, it's becoming more common, almost expected sometimes, to include this kind of thing. Interesting. So, from the job seeker's point of view, you can see the logic. It feels…

41
00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.820
Simon Wang: proactive, informative.

42
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.890
Simon Wang: Okay, so as you can see here, this audio actually kind of stopped

43
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.860
Simon Wang: a little bit, abruptly. It's… it's not, like, a very natural ending.

44
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:27.849
Simon Wang: But then, according to here, it says we will hear two excerpts, but, there's only one. So, the question here is, we need to ask

45
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:36.890
Simon Wang: the programming consultant, whether we can add another audio here, so the students can decide

46
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.360
Simon Wang: You know, after listening to the first and the second.

47
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:51.409
Simon Wang: But then we also do not know, which questions are connected to which audio.

48
00:06:51.660 --> 00:07:05.660
Simon Wang: So, that's something we need to clarify with the staff that are writing the exam papers. So, you can already see that there's some problem here.

49
00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:14.930
Simon Wang: But… Yeah, so, so, so… but then, of course, what we need to do is go back to…

50
00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:25.260
Simon Wang: the folder… that I just sent… And,

51
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:39.999
Simon Wang: I think the folder is still sending because it's pretty large. And, so, this is another issue. We need to be more explicit and specific about

52
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.320
Simon Wang: the format of the exam questions, okay? Because…

53
00:07:45.710 --> 00:08:01.979
Simon Wang: the task we need to do is actually transfer all the tasks and questions into Markdown file, and that can be a lot of work, but, if we tell the exam writers in advance what specific format we need.

54
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:11.559
Simon Wang: from them, Or even we could give them the markdown file and ask them to fill in the different

55
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.630
Simon Wang: text.

56
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:22.169
Simon Wang: Then that would become a standard workflow, because later on, we're going to start using this platform, and we have to standardize the workflow.

57
00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.990
Simon Wang: To avoid any confusion.

58
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:40.850
Simon Wang: Yeah, so, yeah, you said something about we cannot move to the next question. See, the thing is,

59
00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:48.980
Simon Wang: During the… during the exam, during the audio playing, we cannot move, but now we can move.

60
00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:55.430
Simon Wang: You see what I mean? So, from the test candidate's perspective.

61
00:08:55.940 --> 00:09:09.189
Simon Wang: there are different ways to do this, right? They can actually start by just going through all the questions, and take notes and think about, you know, what this audio is about, and that's perfectly fine. We're okay with it.

62
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:14.039
Simon Wang: But then we need to tell people in advance how this is going to work.

63
00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.109
Simon Wang: Which is why, we need to, like.

64
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:28.889
Simon Wang: provide the training, you know. Remember, we talked about we need a training manual, we need a candidate's manual or something, just to… to show people

65
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:45.630
Simon Wang: how everything is going to work, okay? But, I think we want to have a structure, we want to have an outline for that manual, but we don't want to fill in the details, especially the screenshot just yet, because the screenshot is not yet finalized.

66
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:48.609
Simon Wang: Okay? So,

67
00:09:49.340 --> 00:10:00.979
Simon Wang: that's actually something we want to test. So, so, when I say we want to test the, the listening section, I'm talking about this kind of thing, you know?

68
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:02.990
Simon Wang: Because…

69
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:12.439
Simon Wang: there's, you know, obviously there's a two audio versus one audio thing we need to figure out, but then there's other issues we want to think about as well.

70
00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:21.179
Simon Wang: Yeah, so that's the listening part. Now, another thing I want to discuss is…

71
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:26.759
Simon Wang: If you go to the writing section, let's very briefly talk about the writing section as well.

72
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:32.529
Simon Wang: For the writing section, There's also a little bit of audio.

73
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.540
Simon Wang: And, again, we have, we have to test, right? So…

74
00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.659
Simon Wang: So, we, we read through this.

75
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:53.390
Simon Wang: And, there's the audio that we can listen to, and then there's a total of 40 minutes.

76
00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.030
Simon Wang: writing component.

77
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:02.080
Simon Wang: Situation.

78
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:12.029
Simon Wang: After the reading and listening tasks, you are asked to compile a report focusing on the disadvantages of using personality test results in job applications.

79
00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:23.880
Simon Wang: You will listen to the full podcast. Make notes as you listen. Before the recording starts, you have one minute to familiarize yourself with the task requirement.

80
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:59.979
Simon Wang: Okay, so I'm not going to play the whole audio here, but at some point, maybe you need to listen to the whole audio and think about, maybe just go through the process, including writing.

81
00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:05.820
Simon Wang: It seems like you can… you can ride a little bit… And you can save…

82
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.700
Simon Wang: And then you can go to the… wait…

83
00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:18.570
Simon Wang: Looks… oh, I think it's because, the audio is playing, so you cannot really…

84
00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:27.439
Simon Wang: you cannot really move around when the audio is playing, so… You'll now hear the full podcast.

85
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:29.379
Simon Wang: Make notes as you listen.

86
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:44.609
Simon Wang: Today, we're, tackling something lots of you might be thinking about, especially early in your careers. It's this trend of considering, you know, personality tests, like the Myers-Briggs, the MBPI,

87
00:12:44.610 --> 00:13:09.590
Simon Wang: And whether to put those results on your job applications. You take these tests, maybe for self-discovery, find them interesting, and then think, hey, maybe this helps me stand out. Especially when the job market feels crowded. Exactly. So the big question we're diving into is, is that actually a good idea? And, spoiler alert, it's… well, it's pretty nuanced. It definitely is. It touches on how we, you know, present ourselves professionally.

88
00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:28.869
Simon Wang: how we communicate strengths, and maybe most importantly, what people doing the hiring actually care about. So maybe we should start with why someone, especially a recent grad, might even think about doing this. What's the perceived upside? Okay, yeah, let's unpack that. I mean, if you're just starting out, you want any edge you can get. You look around, see tons of applicants, maybe similar grades, similar majors, and you think.

89
00:13:28.870 --> 00:13:31.060
Simon Wang: how do I show I'm different? And…

90
00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:36.199
Simon Wang: putting down, say, INTJ might feel like a quick way to signal, hey, I'm strategic.

91
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.289
Simon Wang: Or maybe ESFP to say, I'm good with people.

92
00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:58.759
Simon Wang: like a shorthand. Exactly. It feels like a shortcut to communicating your work style, or maybe how you approach problems, and there's this idea that it shows self-awareness, you know, that you thought about yourself, your strengths, weaknesses. Employers often say they value that. Right, it feels like you're being transparent, maybe even getting ahead of the game. Here's who I am, here's how I tick.

93
00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:01.659
Simon Wang: And you sometimes hear that in certain places.

94
00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:13.679
Simon Wang: I think, particularly in parts of Asia, it's becoming more common, almost expected sometimes, to include this kind of thing. Interesting. So, from the job seeker's point of view, you can see the logic. It feels…

95
00:14:13.780 --> 00:14:18.490
Simon Wang: Proactive, informative, but. And there's always a but.

96
00:14:18.770 --> 00:14:25.069
Simon Wang: How does it look from the other side of the desk, the employer's perspective? Yeah, that's where things get tricky, because honestly.

97
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:44.470
Simon Wang: Many hiring managers, HR professionals, they're pretty skeptical. Skeptical how? Like, they just don't care. Well, some see it as maybe unprofessional, or at least, not the best use of valuable resume space. Their main focus, overwhelmingly, is on skills. Can you actually do the job? What experience do you have?

98
00:14:44.560 --> 00:15:01.270
Simon Wang: internships, projects, actual competencies. So the personality label just doesn't carry much weight compared to, say, listing your proficiency in Python or your experience managing a project. Precisely. Because, think about it, those four letters are a huge oversimplification of who you are, right?

99
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:14.079
Simon Wang: People are complex. Putting someone in a box based on a self-reported test, it risks stereotyping. Yeah, I could see that. Like, assuming all introverts are bad in team settings, or all thinking types lack empathy, which just…

100
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:28.930
Simon Wang: Not true. Exactly. And it's crucial to remember what these tests, like the MBTI, were actually designed for. They're intended for self-understanding, personal growth, maybe team development after hiring, not really for selection or recruitment. So using it for hiring is kind of misapplying the tool.

101
00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:34.960
Simon Wang: That's what many experts, including psychologists and even the official MBTI organization, would argue.

102
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:45.180
Simon Wang: They caution against using it for hiring decisions. There are questions about, its reliability over time and its validity in actually predicting job performance.

103
00:15:45.180 --> 00:16:01.180
Simon Wang: Does being an E or an I really tell you if someone will be a good accountant, or engineer, or marketer? The link is tenuous at best. It reminds me of that comparison you sometimes hear. Yeah. Like, it's almost akin to putting your horoscope sign on your resume. Interesting, maybe.

104
00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:11.900
Simon Wang: but not exactly a scientific basis for a hiring decision. That comparison does get made, yeah. While maybe a bit harsh, it highlights the lack of predictive power for job success in the eyes of many employers.

105
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:32.060
Simon Wang: And there's another risk, too, diversity. If you start filtering candidates based on perceived ideal personality types for certain roles, you can end up screening out people with different valuable perspectives, you might build a team where everyone thinks alike, and you lose that, creative friction, that diversity of thought that often leads to innovation. That's a really important point. It's not just

106
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.330
Simon Wang: Potentially unfair to the applicant.

107
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:50.769
Simon Wang: But it could actually harm the company by limiting its talent pool and perspectives. Definitely. It can lead to missed opportunities on both sides, and potentially raise flags about, you know, unconscious bias creeping into the hiring process. Okay, so let's bring it back to the listener.

108
00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:55.280
Simon Wang: If you're a recent graduate, you've maybe done the MBPI, found it insightful.

109
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:58.809
Simon Wang: What's the practical advice here? What should you actually do?

110
00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:02.669
Simon Wang: The general consensus, the sort of standard advice is this.

111
00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:08.799
Simon Wang: While understanding your type can be super helpful for your own growth, for figuring out how you interact best with others.

112
00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:25.389
Simon Wang: proactively putting that MBTI type or similar results on your resume or cover letter, probably not the best move, it's generally not recommended. Generally not. Are there any situations where it might be okay? Like, what if a job ad specifically asks for it? That seems rare, but… It is rare, but it could happen.

113
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:30.649
Simon Wang: If a job description explicitly asks for it, well, then you have a choice to make. You could provide it.

114
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:47.299
Simon Wang: But even then, I'd advise a bit of caution. Think about why they're asking. Is it a company that really understands and uses these tools appropriately, maybe for team-building insights later? Or does it feel like a potentially crude filtering mechanism? Fair enough. So, even if asked.

115
00:17:47.320 --> 00:18:01.399
Simon Wang: Maybe pause and consider. But for the vast majority of applications… For the vast majority, absolutely focus your energy elsewhere. Right. Focus on the stuff we know employers do value. Clearly showing your skills, the hard skills, the soft skills. Yes.

116
00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:14.290
Simon Wang: And providing concrete evidence through your experiences. What did you achieve in your internships? What projects did you complete in school? Any volunteer work that demonstrates relevant qualities? Use that resume, that cover letter, to tell those stories.

117
00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:26.340
Simon Wang: Show, don't just tell. Exactly. And the cover letter and interview are really your prime opportunities to demonstrate things like your communication style, your problem-solving approach, how you collaborate.

118
00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:41.150
Simon Wang: you can illustrate these things with specific examples. Here's a time I worked on a team project, and we faced a challenge. That's much more powerful than just saying, I'm an ENFP. So you're conveying those underlying qualities, the things the personality type might hint at.

119
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:49.740
Simon Wang: But you're doing it through actual evidence of your behavior and accomplishments. Precisely. Let your actions and experiences speak for themselves.

120
00:18:51.730 --> 00:18:55.219
Simon Wang: Okay, so… This is the end of the recording.

121
00:18:55.980 --> 00:19:01.529
Simon Wang: Alright, so… Now have 30 minutes to complete the writing component according to the instructions.

122
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:11.950
Simon Wang: Alright, so after the, playing the whole audio now, students, the candidates will be able to write

123
00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:16.470
Simon Wang: the two paragraphs, and then save and submit.

124
00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:34.059
Simon Wang: while I was listening to this audio, actually, I got some comments. Maybe I just very quickly go through, and then you can take notes, and we can discuss later. I mean, we can raise these issues to the team. For writing tests with, you know, which is about 40 minutes.

125
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:42.230
Simon Wang: The listening audio is about 8 minutes, I think it's a bit long, so that's a concern. Maybe we want to shorten the audio?

126
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.000
Simon Wang: And also, there's no reading materials.

127
00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:57.800
Simon Wang: currently accessible at this section, but in the instruction, it says you are required to make use of information or example found in both the reading passage and the podcast to support your reasoning. So…

128
00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:12.050
Simon Wang: In other words, the expectation here is that students need to take the information from the reading passage into consideration when writing the essay, but the reading passage is not available.

129
00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:29.659
Simon Wang: And there must be something that needs to be done, right? Either we can provide the reading passage on paper, or we provide some space for students to take notes in the reading part, and then the notes can be transferred over to the writing section, so…

130
00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:48.989
Simon Wang: you know, we have to do something, otherwise it's just not possible for students just based on their memory, from the reading test to write this, you know? So that's the kind of problem or issue we need to identify when we're doing this kind of test. It's not very obvious, it's something you have to, you know, you have to start

131
00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.589
Simon Wang: Doing the test, like a student or like a teacher.

132
00:20:52.710 --> 00:21:05.339
Simon Wang: And then you will be able to find this kind of problem, and then we have to raise it, and then we need to discuss with the team so we can start, you know, improve and make sure that it's a good experience for everybody.

133
00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:19.539
Simon Wang: Yeah, so… I think that's the writing part. Later on, when we actually start writing, we can actually submit it and see, you know, how that test will be collected from that end.

134
00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:35.309
Simon Wang: Because at some point, we will actually do the AI assessment, so we're going to send the writing essay, the essay submitted from the students to AI with some prompts and rubrics, and we'll get some feedback back, and even some tentative grades.

135
00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:52.710
Simon Wang: And we need to do that module later on, so that's called AI Assessment of… of the… of the test. But let's… let's take some notes, and we can follow up on that a bit later, because that's the… that's the second stage, that's the assessment part of… of the… of the platform.

136
00:21:53.630 --> 00:22:11.279
Simon Wang: Okay, so, since we're here, maybe we can just very quickly, go through the speaking test again. So, again, you know, this page, I think we need to modify a little bit, at least we should highlight, okay, so we can say something. This check, check, check, we have done all these three, now it's the speaking part.

137
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:15.709
Simon Wang: Now, for the speaking part, we get in…

138
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:22.260
Simon Wang: And, we, we can see that, you know, there's,

139
00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:27.050
Simon Wang: A total of 4 minutes, 1 minute to prepare your answer, and 3 minutes to record a response.

140
00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:46.779
Simon Wang: A timer will count down from 4 minutes, so actually the wording needs to be rephrased a little bit. After 1 minute preparation, you start recording. If you delay starting, you may not have enough time. So I think this is the kind of information we actually need to, kind of,

141
00:22:46.910 --> 00:22:47.830
Simon Wang: just…

142
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:57.419
Simon Wang: inform students in advance. And also, what if students do not enter start section? You know, they just stay here, or whatever?

143
00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.609
Simon Wang: That might actually delay things.

144
00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:03.849
Simon Wang: So maybe we want to start thinking about the…

145
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:08.159
Simon Wang: Putting a timer or something here.

146
00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:12.709
Simon Wang: That, that's, that's one, one, one thing we want to consider.

147
00:23:13.890 --> 00:23:19.510
Simon Wang: Okay, so… and then we can…

148
00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:24.649
Simon Wang: start looking at this. Just one minute to prepare.

149
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:34.789
Simon Wang: So, so I think the format here, we should enlarge the font size a bit, because it's actually a little bit difficult to read.

150
00:23:34.930 --> 00:23:40.310
Simon Wang: Given that there's a time constraint, right, we have to…

151
00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:54.529
Simon Wang: kind of, enlarge this format a little bit, enlarge the font size. So, it's about the disadvantage of using personality test results in job applications. The 3-minute talk.

152
00:23:54.810 --> 00:23:57.909
Simon Wang: And, there's a timer here.

153
00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:10.750
Simon Wang: And, we can, start recording, so we actually need to do a little bit, recording, you know? So, basically, we can try and, record the whole thing.

154
00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:12.519
Simon Wang: And, because…

155
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:30.030
Simon Wang: here, there's a timer here, but there's no timer here. Well, actually, there is a timer here, but there's no countdown, so we are talking about up to 3 minutes, so basically, the student needs to keep talking and record the whole thing.

156
00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:41.160
Simon Wang: And apparently there's no space for people to take notes, so we're thinking either we need to provide the students some… some… a piece of paper or something to write the…

157
00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:59.909
Simon Wang: the notes, then that's actually something we have to design. We need to inform the students in advance that at this stage, during the preparation time, there will be a paper provided for them, and maybe pencil as well, so they can take the notes, and then they can use that notes to give the talk.

158
00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:15.259
Simon Wang: Yeah, so… so I think that's kind of the details we need to think about in terms of the whole setting of the test, how we can provide all the logistics support for the students, and make sure that they have a good experience.

159
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:22.770
Simon Wang: Right, and here, there's, like, a total of,

160
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:36.190
Simon Wang: a total of, 3 minutes, so we need to test the edge case. Obviously, if I stop, and then, it can be saved, but what if, while I'm talking, the timer, you know, the time is up?

161
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:43.330
Simon Wang: So, so that's kind of a more kind of unusual case, right? Because the student didn't really put…

162
00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.700
Simon Wang: Click on stop, or even saved.

163
00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:48.179
Simon Wang: Will the audio be…

164
00:25:48.180 --> 00:26:10.050
Simon Wang: will the microphone be stopped automatically, and will the audio be saved automatically and uploaded to the server? So these are the edge cases we have to test. So, one of the key strategies when it comes to doing this kind of test is to look at the edge case, look at the exceptional case.

165
00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:27.479
Simon Wang: but not necessarily the ordinary or usual case. I mean, the usual operation, it's probably going to work, right? So that's kind of the normal circumstances. But what's really important here is we have to test those exceptional cases

166
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:32.480
Simon Wang: When, unexpected or unusual things happened.

167
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:38.530
Simon Wang: And we need to see how the platform behaves

168
00:26:38.890 --> 00:26:45.190
Simon Wang: Under those circumstances, and whether those behaviors are acceptable.

169
00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:50.349
Simon Wang: So this is actually, you know, something we have to do to follow up.

170
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:55.930
Simon Wang: But let's see, I think we're almost done here.

171
00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:02.779
Simon Wang: Yeah, we're almost done here.

172
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:12.749
Simon Wang: So you see here, it's even over 3 minutes, it still keep recording, so that's a concern.

173
00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:17.129
Simon Wang: I mean, the microphone should stop.

174
00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:24.289
Simon Wang: And now, you can see the exam, is completed, so it's been logged out.

175
00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:28.790
Simon Wang: And then we need to kind of…

176
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:38.440
Simon Wang: Okay, so here's another thing. Now, we finished everything, and it's logged out. I think that's not a very good closure.

177
00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:55.989
Simon Wang: a good closure would be, we need to have a page saying that, okay, this is what you have done, the test, you know, this is your test candidate number, blah blah blah blah, and, you know, thank you for taking the test, and, you know, whatever. So we need to have a proper closure, right? We don't want to just…

178
00:27:56.820 --> 00:28:03.760
Simon Wang: the logout, you know? Yeah, so that's the kind of issue we want to think about as well.

179
00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:15.850
Simon Wang: Yeah, so we kind of tested a little bit, you know, we go through listening, we go through writing, and we go through speaking. Not reading, because I did reading before.

180
00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:24.580
Simon Wang: And, I'm doing this recording, so I think we should be able to take some screenshots, and also the transcript we'll be able to access

181
00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:29.400
Simon Wang: All the… the… You know, issue here.
