### Job Hunting
```
full score: 15
unit score: 1
```

**Situation:**

You are Tony Chan, the Career Advisor at Harbor view Secondary School. The School Principal has asked you to prepare a talk on the use of Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) in Job Hunting. Read the article on the trend of MBTI in job hunting and answer the following questions.

“What is Your Type?”: The MBTI Trend in Job Hunting and Why It Might Backfire

[1] It starts innocently enough. You are polishing your CV, scrolling through job boards, and you notice a new line creeping into candidate profiles and cover letters: “INFJ seeking dynamic team,” or “ENTP with a passion for innovation.” Welcome to the era where the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) isn’t just a quirky icebreaker–it’s becoming a badge of identity for Gen Z job hunters. But as this trend sweeps through LinkedIn feeds and interview rooms, a pressing question emerges: Is this personality shorthand helping–or hurting–your chances of landing the job?

**The Rise of MBTI in Job Applications**

[2] For the new generation entering the workforce, self-branding is second nature. Personality tests like MBTI, once reserved for team-building retreats or late-night dorm debates, are now finding their way onto résumés and application forms. According to a 2018 report, about 20% of Fortune 1000 companies have used MBTI in their hiring process, and an impressive 89 out of the Fortune 100 employ it for hiring, team-building, or leadership development. The global market for workplace personality assessments, including MBTI, is now estimated at over $2 billion annually. 

[3] For many young applicants, sharing their MBTI type is a way to stand out. A recent graduate might write, “As an ENFP, I bring creative energy and adaptability to teams,” hoping to catch a recruiter’s eye. The logic is clear: a quick personality snapshot could tip the scales in a crowded field.

**How Companies Are Reacting**

[4] Employers, for their part, are divided. Some Human Resources teams, especially in tech startups and creative industries, have embraced MBTI as a tool for building balanced teams and fostering workplace harmony. Others, however, are wary if not entirely resistant. The creators of MBTI themselves caution against its use in hiring decisions, warning that it was never designed to predict job performance or suitability. In fact, the Myers & Briggs Foundation explicitly states that using MBTI for hiring or job assignments is unethical.

[5] Yet, there are many accounts of companies screening for certain types, or even rejecting candidates whose four-letter code doesn’t fit a preconceived mold. One Reddit user recounted how a company would not hire ESFJs, regardless of their qualifications, simply because of their MBTI type. Another candidate, an INTJ, found themselves having to justify their introversion to a skeptical interviewer, who wrongly equated sociability with extra version and nearly dismissed their application as a result.

**The Hidden Risks: Stereotyping and Missed Potential**

[6] The most immediate danger of this trend is the rise of stereotyping. When MBTI becomes a gatekeeper, it reduces complex individuals to a handful of binary traits: introvert or extrovert, thinker or feeler. This can lead to companies overlooking exceptional candidates simply because their “type” doesn’t match a hiring manager’s expectations. For example, a company might reject an introverted ISTJ for a client-facing role, assuming they lack people skills, or dismiss an ENFP for a finance position, believing they’re too "imaginative" for structured work

[7] Moreover, MBTI does not necessarily predict job success. A study found that only 50% of individuals ended up in careers that matched their MBTI “ideal” roles, and even then, many factors beyond personality influenced their career paths. The Myers-Briggs Company itself confirms that MBTI should not be used for selection because it cannot predict performance.

[8] Some employers who adopted MBTI-based screening are now rethinking their approach. As one HR leader at a Fortune 500 firm noted, “We found that relying on MBTI for hiring led to missed opportunities and less diverse teams. We’re moving toward holistic assessments that consider skills, experience, and real-world problem-solving.” This shift is echoed in the broader market, with organizations seeking scientifically validated alternatives to MBTI for hiring purposes.

**Self-Limiting Beliefs and Gaming the System**

[9] The trend isn’t just risky for employers; it can backfire for candidates, too. When young job-seekers internalize their MBTI labels, they may begin to see their career options as limited. An ISTJ might avoid creative roles, convinced they’re not “imaginative enough”; while an ENFP could shy away from analytical work, fearing they lack focus. This self-selection narrows horizons, stifles growth, and continues the very stereotypes the MBTI was meant to illuminate, not enforce.

[10] There’s also the temptation to game the system. Knowing that some companies prefer certain types, candidates may fudge their answers or present an idealized version of themselves, undermining the authenticity that MBTI is supposed to promote. This not only distorts hiring outcomes but can lead to mismatched expectations and dissatisfaction overtime.

**The Legal and Ethical Minefield**

[11] Beyond the practical pitfalls, there are legal and ethical concerns. In some regions, using MBTI as a hiring filter could be grounds for discrimination claims. The lack of scientific validity for hiring purposes means that companies risk making poor decisions, or even opening themselves up to lawsuits by relying too heavily on these tests.
A Smarter Path: Holistic Hiring

[12] So, where does this leave the MBTI trend? Used thoughtfully, MBTI can be a valuable tool for self-reflection and team development. It can help individuals understand their preferences and growth areas, and it can spark useful conversations about working styles. But when it becomes a hiring shortcut, it does more harm than good.

[13] Forward-thinking organizations are moving away from MBTI-based screening in favor of holistic, data-driven assessments. These methods combine skills testing, behavioral interviews, and real-world scenarios to paint a fuller picture of a candidate’s potential. The goal: to reduce bias, increase diversity, and make hiring decisions that are grounded in evidence, instead of just personality preferences.
