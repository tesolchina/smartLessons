**Session Report**

- **Letter metadata & policy relevance:**  
  No letter or metadata was provided by the student during the session; thus, no policy relevance check was possible.

- **Options explored:**  
  None of the policy analysis options (1–3) were explored. The conversation was primarily about clarifying the request for a “menu” and interpreting the user’s intent.

- **Key insights for explored options:**  
  - No options related to policy analysis were selected or discussed.  
  - The user’s initial input “menu” was interpreted in multiple ways (restaurant menu, digital menu, AI commands, daily meal plan), indicating some ambiguity in intent.  
  - The assistant provided a sample restaurant menu as a default response

### 🤖 **Assistant** (23:02:24)

Hello! I’m your Policy Discourse Analyst for the GE course ‘Taking a Stand: Turning Research Insights into Policy Recommendations.’

Please paste a Letter to the Editor you want to analyze. I’ll first check if it’s related to government policy. If it isn’t, I’ll ask you to choose another letter about government policies.

When we have a relevant letter, you can type ‘menu’ anytime to choose one of these options:
1) Explore the context of the problem
2) Describe the stakeholders and the problem
3) Review data collection and analysis
4) Build and evaluate the arguments
5) Increase impact on the society

Tip: When you paste the letter, include any source details you have (date, outlet).
