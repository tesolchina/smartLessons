__COURSE CONTENT __

Part 1: Foundations of Generative AI and Language

Introduction to Generative AI and Large Language Models: Overview of current technologies, focusing on their linguistic capabilities and applications\.

Language and AI: Exploring the intersection of language, culture, and technology, and how AI systems reflect and shape language use\.

Critical Thinking and AI: Developing critical thinking skills to evaluate AI\-generated responses, identify biases, and recognize the limitations of AI systems\.

Part 2: Community Engagement and Solution Design

Community Needs Assessment: Utilizing design thinking to explore and understand the specific linguistic and educational needs of partner communities, and identifying opportunities for chatbot solutions to address these needs\.

Language and Communication Strategies: Developing effective language and communication strategies to design and deploy chatbot solutions that meet community needs, including:

- Clear and concise writing for chatbot dialogues: Focusing on the creation of straightforward and understandable chatbot communications\.
- Effective questioning and feedback techniques for chatbot interactions: Developing chatbot capabilities to ask relevant and thought\-provoking questions that engage users and evoke meaningful responses
- Active listening and empathy in chatbot design: Enhancing chatbots to accurately interpret user emotions and context, enabling responses that reflect understanding and sensitivity to user needs\.

Critical Thinking and Problem\-Solving: Applying critical thinking and problem\-solving skills to evaluate the effectiveness of chatbot solutions and identify areas for improvement\.

__Introducing Case Studies to Guide Solution Design:__

 To support students in designing and deploying chatbot solutions, we introduce real\-world case studies as learning tools\. These case studies illustrate how customized chatbots can address specific community challenges, providing inspiration and practical insights for students’ own projects\. The case studies will be introduced after the *Community Needs Assessment* stage, serving as examples of how needs\-based design can be translated into effective chatbot solutions\.

Empowering Communities through Customized Chatbots: Case Studies

Case Study 1: Developing a customized chatbot to design course materials for a rural primary school where teachers are not well\-trained on STEM subjects\. The chatbot can generate materials that adapt to the local context but also take into account the latest high\-quality STEM teaching materials from abroad\. This chatbot can help bridge the educational gap and provide students with access to high\-quality learning materials\.

Case Study 2: Building a customized chatbot to support a mobile family community in Shenzhen, where parents struggle to understand the school admission policies of the municipal government\. Under the supervision of experienced social workers and trained volunteers, the chatbot can provide accurate and timely information, answering questions and addressing concerns about school admission policies\. This chatbot can empower parents and help them navigate the complex education system, ultimately benefiting their children’s education and future opportunities\.

Part 3: Implementation and Evaluation

Chatbot Deployment: Guidance on the finalization and launch of customized chatbot prototypes within community settings, driven by prompt engineering and other human\-AI communication strategies, including:

- Crafting effective prompts to elicit desired responses from AI systems
- Designing conversational flows that facilitate effective human\-AI interaction
- Utilizing feedback mechanisms to refine chatbot performance and adapt to chatbot users’ needs including student developers and end users
- Impact Assessment: Methods for gathering and analyzing feedback on the chatbot’s effectiveness in achieving learning outcomes, including the enhancement of linguistic and communicative skills for students and the communities they serve\.

Dissemination and Celebration: Techniques for sharing success stories and the impact of chatbot solutions through compelling storytelling, highlighting the role of language and communication in effective human\-AI interactions\.

__Service\-Learning Projects__

Students will participate in service\-learning projects with community partners, where they will design, develop, and deploy customized chatbots to address real\-world communication challenges\.

Through these projects, students will apply linguistic insights to shape chatbot learning goals suited to community needs, and develop critical thinking abilities to evaluate the effectiveness of their chatbot solutions\.

Students will also engage in reflective practices to identify areas for linguistic and technical improvement, and discuss ways to better meet community communication requirements\.

The service\-learning projects will be assessed through the Group Project \(35%\) and Multimodal Presentation \(30%\) components, where students will demonstrate their ability to design, develop, and deploy effective chatbot solutions that meet community needs\.

Students will also reflect on their learning and project development process through the Reflective Learning Journals \(15%\), where they will document their progress, challenges, and insights gained throughout the project\.
