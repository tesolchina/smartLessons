6. Please specify the achievements, results and impact of the service-learning component.

The service-learning component achieved significant educational and community impact through a comprehensive 2.5-week immersion program in a rural primary school in Henan Province. Our cohort of 31 students successfully delivered educational services to over 80 local students across six grade levels, creating meaningful cross-cultural learning exchanges. During our presence at the village school, the majority of the local teaching team was able to receive professional development opportunities, spending two weeks in Zhengzhou for specialized training—a relief that would not have been possible without our educational support.

The program fostered collaborative innovation through the formation of nine student teams, each focusing on distinct AI-related projects tailored to the local educational context. Students demonstrated technical proficiency by designing interactive educational games using HTML and JavaScript programming, creating engaging digital learning resources specifically adapted for the rural school environment. Through careful preparation and delivery of structured lesson plans, our students gained valuable pedagogical experience while providing quality educational content to the local student body.

The project's impact extends beyond the immediate service period, with plans to amplify its reach through knowledge sharing initiatives. We intend to disseminate the developed lesson plans and educational resources to Hong Kong teachers via the HK EdCity platform by 2025, thereby creating a sustainable model for cross-regional educational collaboration. Additionally, the program explored opportunities to promote local cultural heritage, particularly the historic significance of the Chenqiao area (陈桥兵变), integrating tourism development potential with educational objectives.


7. Please describe the challenges arising from the service-learning component (if any) and how you address them.

The service-learning component presented several significant challenges that required adaptive strategies and resilient problem-solving approaches. The primary technical challenge emerged from students' limited prior experience with artificial intelligence technologies, which necessitated intensive on-site mentoring and collaborative peer learning to bridge the knowledge gap. Our response involved implementing a scaffolded learning approach where more experienced students provided support to their peers, creating an inclusive learning environment that fostered collective skill development.

Infrastructure limitations posed substantial operational challenges, particularly the inadequate e-learning facilities at the rural school site. The lack of reliable internet connectivity and modern technological resources required us to develop offline-capable solutions and adapt our digital teaching materials for low-tech environments. We addressed this by creating downloadable resources and designing activities that could function effectively with minimal technological dependencies.

The living conditions presented additional logistical challenges that tested our students' adaptability and resilience. The absence of running water and the use of traditional dry toilet facilities (旱厕) required significant adjustment periods and careful health and safety protocols. We addressed these challenges through comprehensive pre-departure preparation sessions, establishing clear hygiene protocols, and maintaining open communication channels to support student wellbeing throughout the program.

Administrative challenges also emerged in the post-program phase, particularly regarding the reimbursement process, which proved to be both time-consuming and procedurally complex. We are working to streamline future documentation requirements and establish clearer communication protocols with administrative offices to expedite financial processing for subsequent programs. These experiences have informed our planning for future service-learning initiatives, enabling us to better prepare students and establish more efficient operational frameworks.
