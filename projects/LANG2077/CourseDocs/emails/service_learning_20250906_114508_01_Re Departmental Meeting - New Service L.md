Best,
Nancy

Dear Nancy and Simon,

How about we use the same set of slides due to time constraint?

Nancy, when you have the slides up, can you share with us and I will add mine?

Good wishes,

Joshua

Dear Joshua, 

Many thanks for your kind message. 

Sure, I could talk about my service-learning project. So I will prepare 2 slides, and I can talk for less than 2 minutes for my project. How do you think?

I will try to get the slides as soon as possible. 

Thank you and best,
Nancy

Dear Simon and all,

Thanks a lot for launching the course and presenting its information during the departmental meeting next Monday. Just had a meeting with Cissy and Hok Chung. Cissy mentioned that this item is for cross-sectional sharing and can include more projects.

During that section of the meeting, called 'innovative pedagogy - experiential learning/situated learning', perhaps Nancy can also talk about her service-learning project, and I will also talk about mine? Perhaps 2-3 slides will be enough (5 mins for all). What does everyone think?

Good wishes,

Joshua

Subject: Departmental Meeting - New Service Learning Course
 
Hi Simon,

As you have your new Service Learning course approved and you've run it in May, would you like to share anything with us at the Departmental Meeting? You can talk about the approach to your new course, share some videos if there are any, just anything that you have on hand. We can give you 5 minutes to talk about your new course (like Janice showed us her PTH course where students wrote and performed skits).

If so, please send me any materials you'd like to present by Friday morning. Let me know your thoughts.  

Thanks. 

Regards,
