# SCMP Letters Research Corpus - Solution Summary

**Date:** September 14, 2025  
**Project:** BenSCMPGRF Letter Analysis

## Problem Analysis

### What went wrong with the original approach:
1. **Fake letter splitting** - The previous extraction created 89 "letters" that were actually just page subtitles, not real letter content
2. **Incomplete content extraction** - Our existing data only contains partial content from each page, missing the individual letters
3. **Wrong separation logic** - Used paragraph-based splitting instead of identifying actual letter boundaries marked by ### headings

### Root cause:
SCMP uses dynamic JavaScript loading, so simple HTTP requests don't capture the complete content with all individual letters.

## Successful Solution Demonstrated

### ✅ Proper Extraction Results:
- **Input:** 2 SCMP letter pages
- **Output:** 4 individual letters (2.0 letters per page average)
- **Authors properly identified:** Shevaun Gallwey, Raymond Yang Sze-ngai, Lawrence Choi
- **Realistic content lengths:** 359-2,736 characters per letter

### ✅ Correct Structure Identified:
Each SCMP letters page contains:
1. **Main page title:** "Letters | [Topic]"
2. **Page subtitle:** "Readers discuss [multiple topics]..."  
3. **Individual letters:** Each marked with ### heading, content, and author

### ✅ Technical Solution:
- Use `fetch_webpage` tool approach to get complete content
- Split content by `### [Letter Title]` pattern
- Extract author names from end of each letter section
- Filter out navigation/advertisement content

## Current State

### Working Files:
1. **`demo_proper_extraction/`** - Demonstrates correct extraction (4 letters from 2 pages)
2. **`individual_letters_manual/`** - Manual extraction example (3 letters from Victory Day page)
3. **`research_corpus/`** - Current corpus with 25 letters (one per page, incomplete)

### Data Quality Issues:
- **Existing JSON data is incomplete** - only contains first letter from each page
- **Need fresh webpage fetching** for complete content extraction
- **Current corpus: 25 letters** (should be ~60-75 letters with proper extraction)

## Complete Solution Implementation

To create a proper research corpus with correctly separated individual letters:

### Phase 1: Fresh Content Extraction ✅ DONE
- [x] Identify webpage structure and letter patterns  
- [x] Create working extraction algorithm
- [x] Demonstrate successful separation (4 letters from 2 pages)

### Phase 2: Full Corpus Generation (RECOMMENDED NEXT STEP)
```python
# Use fetch_webpage tool for all 25 pages to get complete content
# Apply the demonstrated extraction algorithm
# Expected results: ~60-75 individual letters total
```

### Phase 3: Research Corpus Organization
```
research_corpus/
├── json/           # Individual letters in JSON format
├── markdown/       # Individual letters in Markdown format  
├── summary.json    # Complete corpus metadata
├── README.md       # Corpus documentation
└── statistics.txt  # Author counts, topic analysis, etc.
```

## Key Insights for Research

### Letter Structure Patterns:
1. **Multi-letter pages** - Most pages contain 2-3 individual letters
2. **Clear authorship** - Each letter has identified author with location
3. **Topic diversity** - Letters cover different aspects of main theme
4. **Length variation** - Letters range from 300-3000 characters

### Author Attribution Patterns:
- Format: "Name, Location" (e.g., "Shevaun Gallwey, Sha Tin")
- Format: "Name, Title, Organization" (e.g., "Raymond Yang Sze-ngai, co-founder and executive director, Just Feel")
- Authors include both locals and internationals

### Content Quality:
- Each letter is a complete argument/viewpoint
- Substantial content (300+ characters minimum)
- Clear topic focus within broader page theme

## Recommendations

### For Research Analysis:
1. **Use the demonstrated approach** - The demo shows the correct methodology
2. **Expect 2-3x more letters** - Proper extraction should yield ~60-75 letters from 25 pages
3. **Focus on author diversity** - Multiple perspectives per topic page
4. **Consider topic clustering** - Letters group around major themes

### For Implementation:
1. **Use fetch_webpage tool** for complete content retrieval
2. **Apply ### heading-based separation** as demonstrated
3. **Implement robust author detection** using the patterns identified
4. **Create comprehensive metadata** for research analysis

## File Locations

### Working Examples:
- **Manual extraction:** `individual_letters_manual/` (3 letters, correct format)
- **Demo extraction:** `demo_proper_extraction/` (4 letters from 2 pages)
- **Current corpus:** `research_corpus/` (25 letters, needs improvement)

### Source Data:
- **Clean pages:** `scmp_letters_output/scmp_letters_clean_20250914_191353.json` (25 pages)
- **Original crawl:** `scmp_letters_output/letters_2025-09-14.json` (36 pages)

### Scripts:
- **Demo script:** `letterCrawling/demo_proper_extraction.py` ✅ WORKING
- **Manual example:** `letterCrawling/manual_letter_extraction.py` ✅ WORKING  
- **Full corpus script:** `letterCrawling/create_research_corpus.py` (needs fetch_webpage integration)

**Status:** The technical solution is identified and demonstrated. The next step is to apply the working methodology to all 25 pages to create the complete research corpus with properly separated individual letters.
