    "summary": "",
    "content": "And, frankly, the arguments made to derail the bill weren’t particularly strong. Some lawmakers argued during the legislative process that formal recognition of same-sex couples undermines Chinese culture. This is a false premise. Sexual orientation is not a cultural phenomenon to be imported or rejected. It is a human reality, present across time, geography and tradition. By dismissing the lives of same-sex couples as merely foreign, Hong Kong diminishes its own people and writes them out of their own culture.\n\nRecognising same-sex relationships would not have compromised Hong Kong’s cultural integrity nor its Chinese identity; it would have enriched it by reflecting the diversity that has always been part of this city’s story. A society confident in its heritage does not fear extending dignity to its minorities.",
