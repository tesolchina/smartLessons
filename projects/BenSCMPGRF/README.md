# BenSCMPGRF

(Initial project README created by index generator)


<!-- AUTO_PROJECT_INDEX:START -->
Auto-generated index for project `BenSCMPGRF` at 2025-09-12T07:05:57Z UTC.
<!-- DAILYASSISTANT_TOOLS_PATH=../tools -->
Regenerate with: `python tools/cli/generate_project_indexes.py --dirs BenSCMPGRF`

## Tool Access
- Tools directory (relative): `../tools` (packaged import: `import dailyassistant` after editable install)
- Tools directory (absolute at generation time): `/Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/tools`
- Root quick start: see `../README.md` and `../QUICK_START_GUIDE.md`
- CLI (if installed): run `da --help` or regenerate indexes with `da index projects` (future)
- Environment variable (optional): `export DAILYASSISTANT_ROOT=`git rev-parse --show-toplevel``

### Install & Use
1. Install latest main directly from Git (no clone needed):
   ````bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/tesolchina/DailyAssistant.git
   ````
2. Install specific tag/ref:
   ````bash
   pip install git+https://github.com/tesolchina/DailyAssistant.git@<tag_or_commit>
   ````
3. Editable install after cloning (development):
   ````bash
   git clone https://github.com/tesolchina/DailyAssistant.git dailyassistant-src
   cd dailyassistant-src
   pip install -e .
   ````
4. Run a tool script directly (no install):
   ````bash
   python /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/tools/cli/generate_tool_indexes.py
   ````
5. Via package module (after install):
   ````bash
   python -m dailyassistant.cli.generate_tool_indexes
   ````
6. Via CLI entry point (if defined in pyproject):
   ````bash
   da tool-index
   ````
7. Ad-hoc PYTHONPATH (quick test, no install):
   ````bash
   PYTHONPATH=/Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant python /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/tools/cli/generate_project_indexes.py --dirs BenSCMPGRF
   ````

### Programmatic Path Detection
- Programmatic path detection snippet:

```python
from pathlib import Path
PROJECT_DIR = Path(__file__).resolve().parent
REPO_ROOT = PROJECT_DIR.parent  # contains 'tools' and 'projects'
TOOLS_DIR = REPO_ROOT / 'tools'
```
