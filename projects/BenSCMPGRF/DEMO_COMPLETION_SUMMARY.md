## ðŸ“ž For Ben's Response

The demo analysis proves our LLM framework can deliver the sophisticated citizenship discourse analysis your GRF research requires. The combination of:

- **Theoretical Rigor** (Critical Discourse Analysis)
- **Technical Innovation** (LLM prompt engineering) 
- **Empirical Validation** (Evidence-based classification)
- **Scalable Implementation** (Full corpus processing ready)

...creates a powerful tool for understanding Hong Kong's evolving citizenship discourse during this critical 2018-2023 period.

**Ready for your review and feedback to proceed with full analysis! ðŸŽ¯**
