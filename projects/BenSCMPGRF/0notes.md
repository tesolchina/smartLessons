~~I am working with Ben on a GRF project~~

~~https://github.com/tesolchina/GRF_SCMP_letters.git got this repo which I might clone here~~

~~we can take a look what we've got~~

~~the idea is to develop a corpus of SCMP letters and explore how the writers practice their citizenship in HK context~~

~~we are looking into using LLM via openrouter API to automate the analysis~~

~~Got this new word doc from Ben a GRF application 4 years ago~~

~~please take a look and explore how we might analyze the corpus using LLM - let's create or update a project plan~~ ‚úÖ

~~let's upload the plan to google drive into a folder SimonNotes~~ ‚úÖ
~~also create another note (Google docs) to discuss with Ben~~ ‚úÖ
~~ask for an update on corpus building to sync the folder~~ ‚úÖ
~~also the latest GRF application~~ ‚úÖ
~~any research literature to share - place them in the folder~~ ‚úÖ

~~Let's move all the Google drive/ docs related scripts to /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/operating/GoogleDocsAPI for future use and keep them as generic as possible~~ ‚úÖ

~~can you move the Google docs created to https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Qt6Ak8sHMd7ZpX5T-p_4-pBH0r98L3rs~~ ‚úÖ

~~yes draft an email to Ben including links to Google drive and talk a bit about how GitHub co-pilot has been very useful~~ ‚úÖ

~~I mean a sub folder SimonNotes in https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Qt6Ak8sHMd7ZpX5T-p_4-pBH0r98L3rs~~ ‚úÖ

~~also let's do some preliminary analysis of a small collection of letters using LLM to demo its capability~~ ‚úÖ

~~we should have a dedicated folder for such analysis here locally and sync with Google drive of Ben's team~~ ‚úÖ

~~for the demo analysis we need to create a Google docs to describe the process for human readers (md and json can be uploaded for reference) in the Google docs we should present the letters and the analytical results after each letter and a section on how the analysis was done via API etc~~ ‚úÖ

~~two files here /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/projects/BenSCMPGRF/synced_from_drive should be merged and update Google drive~~ ‚úÖ

~~https://docs.google.com/document/d/19phgQgrSrJv2Y_eNQ8PnqH74V6xIqCs2OXdq4SUkhH0/edit?tab=t.0 this doc should include the original letters being analyzed and leave a section for human researchers to write comments~~ ‚úÖ

~~the original letter should be presented followed by analysis and then human researcher feedback~~ ‚úÖ
