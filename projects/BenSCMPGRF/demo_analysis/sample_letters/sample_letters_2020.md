# Sample SCMP Letters for LLM Demo Analysis (2020)

## Letter 1: COVID-19 Quarantine Policy Critique

**Title:** Hong Kong fourth wave Covid: ever harsher curbs aren't cutting it
**Date:** December 31, 2020
**Author:** Dayal N. Harjani

As Hong Kong approaches one year of battling the coronavirus pandemic, one of the most agonising public complaints have been about the 14-day quarantine for arrivals, which has now been extended to 21 days. What makes 21 days of isolation unimpeachable?

Moreover, if a traveller is confirmed Covid-negative upon arrival, why can't they self-quarantine at home? Being locked up in a hotel room for three weeks could well prompt physical and psychological issues.

Hence, while trying to contain the coronavirus, other sicknesses may emerge due to the quarantine measures. The Hong Kong government could consider promoting, marketing and placing a greater emphasis on the ageless remedy of sunshine (Vitamin D) to strengthen one's immune system.

Other solutions could be deep breathing exercises, traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda, the traditional Indian alternative medicine system. While not watertight, some of these wellness practices have stood the test of time.

On the economy, requiring restaurants to shut at 6pm could displace many mom-and-pop eateries. Again, what makes 6pm sacrosanct? Why not 10pm? Additionally, and given these challenging times, the price for a Covid-19 test in the private sector seems relatively high, and should be subsidised.

Of course, this is easier said than done and, granted, the health and safety of citizens take precedence over the economy – but what Hong Kong needs is an enhanced plan that balances preventive means and the economic pummelling. Some out-of-the-box initiatives should be considered.

## Letter 2: Vaccine Skepticism and Government Trust

**Title:** Why Covid-19 may be here to stay  
**Date:** December 31, 2020
**Author:** Jacqueline Kwan

I have long wondered if vaccines are the definitive answer to the Covid-19 crisis. Recent developments have only confirmed my fears. There have been reports on social media of harmful side effects, such as severe allergic reactions and facial paralysis. Though their link to the vaccine has yet to be fully substantiated, these side effects do cause concern. Sufferers may not be compensated nor have access to complaint channels. There are no guarantees as yet on the effectiveness of the vaccines currently on the market and the period of protection offered either.

Hong Kong will have access to three types of vaccines. The one most promoted locally happens to be from mainland China. Most of the people I asked say they are scared and won't take any shot whatsoever. One said she would, but if only absolutely necessary.

If voluntary vaccination fails, would the Hong Kong government push forward a mandatory programme? Considering people have so little confidence in our government led by Chief Executive Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, it is unlikely this would succeed.

With a complete lockdown impossible and a minority always undisciplined and rebellious, I believe I am not too pessimistic in thinking that the pandemic is here to stay.

## Letter 3: Global Cooperation and Nationalism  

**Title:** As coronavirus pandemic sparks vaccine 'wars', globalisation spreads message of hope and strength
**Date:** December 31, 2020
**Author:** Isaac C.K. Tan

Soon after Britain started the world's first Covid-19 mass vaccination exercise, its health minister announced that a new variant of the coronavirus was spreading in the country. From disputes surrounding the label "China virus", to America's withdrawal from the World Health Organization in July, tensions in international relations took a new spin in August when Russia announced approval of its Sputnik V vaccine. If this marked the beginning of a renewed Cold War, then vaccines are the new weapons of old enemies.

Epidemics and diseases are never immune from political discourse. Since the WHO's coronavirus pandemic declaration in March, governments around the world have declared war against this invisible entity. Infecting the human body is just one of the virus' many capabilities: it has successfully paralysed economies, exacerbated racial tensions and ignited political unrest.

Countries are in a quagmire of balancing economic priorities while suppressing the viral spread. In this period of restricted globalism, countries such as Japan and Sweden avoided imposing "hard" lockdowns by appealing to their citizens' consciousness of personal hygiene practices – a blatant reference to national exceptionalism.

However, as of December 27, Sweden had surpassed many Western countries in its daily confirmed cases per million, and Japan has seen a surge in cases since November. Indeed, there may be no single fail-safe approach to tackling the crisis, but leaving a deadly virus unchecked is not an option.

Lifestyles have changed, and a new normal has descended upon humanity. Ironically, television screens that should have been showing the medals tally for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics now display daily updates of Covid-19 infections and deaths. Politicians are appraised according to the number of cases, and territories with the longest record of no community transmission receive the most positive media coverage – a temporary achievement that is easily revoked.

The repercussions of this pandemic might eclipse its predecessors, but then, we have also never lived in a world that was more interconnected. To such a world, globalisation is a message of hope and strength: no country is alone as humanity can work together to overcome this crisis. As seen from the successes in developing Covid-19 vaccines at unprecedented speed around the world, and calls for sharing, this might be a sign of what we can still accomplish.
