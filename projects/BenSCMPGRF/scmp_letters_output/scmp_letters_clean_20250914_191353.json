    "content": "Readers discuss the potential for youth movements to descend into chaos, and China’s developing ties with Iran\n\nWhat unfolded in Nepal this month and in Bangladesh last year cannot be simply framed as a reflection of Gen Z’s heightened sense of conscience. While this generation is undeniably different, demanding freedom and flexibility and being exceptionally vocal about their rights, many are also deeply emotional and driven by passion. This emotional intensity, though powerful, can sometimes cloud judgment, especially when not grounded in historical context.\n\nIn both cases, Gen Z rallied for the right reasons, against censorship, corruption and inequality. But without structure and foresight, their movements devolved into anarchy. The poor remain poor, the economy suffers and the promise of change fades.\n\nThe next generation must learn from history. Passion must be paired with perspective. Protests must be organised, inclusive and rooted in a long-term vision. Otherwise, the ideals Gen Z fights for risk being undermined by the chaos that follows.",

    "content": "No matter how we slice it, the decision is a step backward. Hong Kong has long prided itself on being outward-looking, modern and global. Yet this vote reinforces an impression of insularity at precisely the time the city can least afford it. The turmoil of 2019 and the subsequent national security crackdown have taken a toll on Hong Kong’s reputation internationally. Passing this bill would have been a chance to show that the city remains aligned with modern standards and earn genuine goodwill both locally and abroad. Instead, that opportunity was incomprehensibly squandered.\n\nAnd, frankly, the arguments made to derail the bill weren’t particularly strong. Some lawmakers argued during the legislative process that formal recognition of same-sex couples undermines Chinese culture. This is a false premise. Sexual orientation is not a cultural phenomenon to be imported or rejected. It is a human reality, present across time, geography and tradition. By dismissing the lives of same-sex couples as merely foreign, Hong Kong diminishes its own people and writes them out of their own culture.\n\nRecognising same-sex relationships would not have compromised Hong Kong’s cultural integrity nor its Chinese identity; it would have enriched it by reflecting the diversity that has always been part of this city’s story. A society confident in its heritage does not fear extending dignity to its minorities.\n\nIf Hong Kong is serious about retaining its place on the world stage, it must demonstrate not just economic vitality but also a higher degree of moral maturity.",

This brief spectacle left many frustrated.\n\nMeanwhile, the entertainment in the music zone felt somewhat one-dimensional, with predominantly Cantonese performances. For “Asia’s World City”, this limited cultural diversity seemed like a lost opportunity to achieve true international resonance.\n\nAnother disappointing moment was that, as far as I could tell, there was an absence of halal food options in the gourmet lane, although Hong Kong has been actively positioning itself as a Muslim-friendly tourist destination, achieving recognition this year as the “Most Promising Muslim-Friendly Destination of the Year” by CrescentRating.\n\nOne cannot help but question: what exactly makes this event “international”? The festival was promoted as Hong Kong’s first international hot air balloon event, featuring balloons from Canada, the United Kingdom, Malaysia and Japan. Yet, the cultural programme was overwhelmingly local.",

    "content": "Yet the parade also conveyed a different message. The banners declared, “Justice Prevails”, “Peace Prevails” and “The People Prevail.” In his address, President Xi Jinping mentioned the word “peace” at least six times, framing military strength as a safeguard against repeating past tragedies. This juxtaposition of overwhelming firepower and repeated calls for peace encapsulates China’s complicated identity: it seeks respect and security while fearing the return of old humiliations.\n\nNowhere is this duality more evident than with regard to Taiwan. For Beijing, Taiwan’s status is the most painful reminder of the century of humiliation. The parade suggested that Beijing is preparing for both paths: on the one hand, overwhelming military power that could force reunification by strength; on the other, rhetoric that leaves open the possibility of a peaceful resolution. That openness signals that, despite nationalist fervour, Beijing has not fully succumbed to the shadows of its past.\n\nChinese displays of military might are not only about competing with Washington; they are also about exorcising historical trauma. If the United States responds only with deterrence and ever tighter alliances, it risks triggering Beijing’s most instinctive and emotional reactions. A more effective strategy would combine credible deterrence with genuine pathways for peaceful coexistence and mutual respect.",

These facts may be inconvenient but they remain a reality for many.\n\nIn Africa, energy investments are one-third lower this year than they were in 2015. For millions, the issue is not choosing between energy sources but securing affordable, reliable power. Denying finance and insurance for coal projects deepens the problem of inequality rather than solves it.\n\nCoal remains the backbone of modern economies, powering steel, cement, manufacturing and millions of jobs. Even renewables depend on it, since wind turbines, solar panels and electric vehicles require coal-based steel and/or cement.

China’s civil code, which came into effect in 2021, continues to exempt rescuers from civil liability for damage caused by voluntary emergency assistance.

    "content": "Readers discuss the changing demographics in schools, government procurement of electric vehicles, and Trump’s targeting of India\n\nFaced with the drastic drop in Hong Kong’s birth rate, introducing new sources of students to the city seems sensible and necessary. As an educator myself, I observe that mainland students have gradually become the mainstream cohort in many schools, especially those under the Direct Subsidy Scheme (DSS).\n\nEven though the influx of mainland Chinese pupils is effectively saving numerous schools from closure, I would like to highlight a worrying issue – some students arrive in Hong Kong with a misconception, believing that the education system in the city is “easier” and that they don’t need to put in as much effort to gain university admission. Education influencers and agencies have, unfortunately, perpetuated a false narrative among mainland Chinese students and parents. These students seem to believe they can come to Hong Kong to escape exam stress and that it is easier to gain a place in elite universities here.\n\nThe learning requirements in Hong Kong and mainland China are fundamentally different. In Hong Kong, the Diploma of Secondary Education examination has relatively higher English standards, more open-ended questions and essay types – skills that appear to be less emphasised in the mainland’s education system. Many mainland Chinese students are not aware of the hard work needed to adapt to another education system.",

Despite promising “high-value tourism”, officials still appear to measure success by headcount alone.\n\nThe human cost is buried in statistics.

Shinzo Abe, when he was prime minister, used the phrase “remorse” in his speech in 2007 during his first term but not during other terms. Ishiba deviated from his Liberal Democratic Party predecessors in using the phrase.\n\nDespite expressing remorse in his speech, Ishiba did not use the terms “invasion” and “aggression” to refer to Japan’s actions. Also, he chose not to issue a cabinet-endorsed statement, which could have included the phrase “remorse”, unlike past leaders who released such a statement for the 50th, 60th and 70th anniversaries.\n\nThe agriculture minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, as well as a former economic security minister and right-wing lawmakers, prayed at the Yasukuni Shrine, which has been seen as a symbol of militarism by Japan’s Asian neighbours. Koizumi’s visit, the first by a minister since Ishiba took office, has been criticised by the Chinese and South Korean governments. On the other hand, Ishiba himself chose not to visit the controversial Yasukuni Shrine but to send an offering.",

There is an urgent need to improve our climate resilience.\n\nFirstly, boost expertise in predicting extreme weather events and making more accurate forecasts ahead of time, especially among scientists at the Hong Kong Observatory.

This would allow the general public to be better prepared for extreme weather, thus minimising property damage and shortening the city’s recovery time from floods and typhoons.\n\nThird, enhance the promotion of Hong Kong’s carbon-neutral policy through an extensive public education campaign on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Alaska’s peaceful transfer from Russia to the United States in 1867 is not often discussed in the context of today’s territorial conflicts.\n\nIndeed, the analogy is far from straightforward – Alaska was transferred by mutual agreement and purchase, whereas Ukraine’s contested regions have been seized and annexed through force, with their status fiercely disputed by all sides.\n\nStill, history can sometimes offer food for thought. The purchase of Alaska for US$7.2 million stands as a rare example of a major territorial change that was wrought without violence, through negotiation rather than war. In contrast, the proposed “land swaps” for Ukraine risk pressuring one side into making concessions and raise difficult questions about sovereignty, legitimacy and international law. There is no easy blueprint: international practice has long varied, and the voices and wishes of local populations have not always shaped outcomes.",
