## ðŸ”„ Updates Needed from You

### 1. **Corpus Building Status**
- How's the corpus building progressing on your end?
- Any additional data sources we should sync?
- Specific preprocessing requirements?

### 2. **Latest Research Materials**
Please add to the SimonNotes folder:
- Most recent GRF application (if different from 2022/23)
- Relevant research literature (Hong Kong discourse, CDA methodology)
- Any updates to research questions/timeline

### 3. **Project Coordination**
- Review the detailed project plan 
- Add your thoughts/changes in the collaboration document
- Let me know your preferred timeline for the analysis

## ðŸš€ Ready to Launch

The LLM analysis framework addresses all four research questions from your GRF:
- **RQ1:** Public debate subjects & socio-political connections
- **RQ2:** Linguistic resources for citizenship communication
- **RQ3:** Epistemologies informing citizenship communication  
- **RQ4:** Letter writing as participatory citizenship validation

We can start the automated analysis as soon as we sync our approaches!

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
1. **You:** Review project plan & add updates to collaboration doc
2. **You:** Upload latest materials to SimonNotes folder
3. **Both:** Coordinate corpus processing & LLM prompt development
4. **Timeline:** 8-week sprint to complete analysis & draft paper
