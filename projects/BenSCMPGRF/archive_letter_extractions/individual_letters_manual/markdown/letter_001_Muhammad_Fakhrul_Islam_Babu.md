China has just marked the 80th anniversary of its victory in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. As memories settle, the conversation shifts from ceremony to responsibility: how history can inform a more stable, rules-based international order in an era of strategic competition and rapid technological change.

The arc of memory runs from the Mukden Incident on September 18, 1931, to the brutal years that followed â€“ the Nanking massacre of 1937, the atrocities associated with Unit 731 and the widespread devastation that disrupted millions of lives. These are not merely chapters in a national narrative but core episodes in the history of wartime atrocities, demanding thorough, evidence-based remembrance lest memory drift into myth or be weaponised for today's political battles.

China's wartime mobilisation tied down substantial portions of Japan's fighting capability before the Pacific war widened the conflict across Asia. Domestic resistance made a significant contribution to the broader Allied effort.

In July 1945, China joined the Potsdam Declaration, underscoring the interconnectedness of wartime alliances and the emergence of a post-war international order, and Japan's formal surrender in September 1945 closed a brutal chapter, with Victory Day on September 3 marking remembrance and resilience.

The commemorations honoured victims and heroes while emphasising restraint and responsibility, with the parade in Tiananmen Square illustrating a mix of traditional formations and modern capabilities within a framework of peaceful development, international cooperation and commitments to global public goods.

The memory of past aggression reinforces a duty to strengthen international collaboration, guided by the United Nations Charter's principle of saving succeeding generations from the scourge of war. Some worry that displays of military modernisation may be misinterpreted as provocation. Others argue that a credible defence can be stabilised when anchored in open diplomacy and norms, provided there is predictable behaviour, transparent doctrine and active UN engagement.

For observers in the Global South, China's wartime sacrifices convey a universal message: the costs of aggression are borne by ordinary people, and sovereignty and development are inseparable from peace. The path forward demands stronger regional confidence-building, renewed multilateralism and a commitment to translating memory into action through dialogue, diplomacy and robust adherence to international norms that protect people as they pursue development and prosperity.
