The national military parade on September 3 reminded us that the peace we currently enjoy came at a high price and that our motherland has now grown into a strong power capable of protecting its people from any kind of aggression. On September 3, some Hong Kong schools organised commemoration events to pay tribute to the Chinese people who resisted Japanese aggression 80 years ago.

I noticed when I browsed Facebook, Instagram and WeChat that, while a raft of my mainland friends shared news about or the live stream or video clips of the parade on WeChat, relatively few Hong Kong friends did the same on Facebook or Instagram.

When patriotic education is discussed, much attention is given to students with a view to cultivating a strong sense of belonging in the next generation. However, adults are unfortunately left out of the picture.

Unlike on the mainland, where people grow up learning the national language, history and culture, many adults in Hong Kong did not have the privilege of receiving such education. Also on the mainland, patriotism is part of corporate culture. Companies often take the initiative to hold patriotic and commemorative events. There is also a Unified Front Work Department which is responsible for promoting solidarity among the people.

Hong Kong society needs to devise strategies to ensure adults in the city have sufficient access to patriotic education.
