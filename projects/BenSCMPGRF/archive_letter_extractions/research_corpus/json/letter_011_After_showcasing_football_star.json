  "content": "Readers discuss the series of high-profile matches in the city, the legal framework for same-sex partnershipships, and a recent scam\nIt is evident that Hong Kong has enjoyed some incredible football moments this year.\nHowever, I felt that the tickets were overpriced; they could have been cheaper for the matches not involving Ronaldo. There wasn’t enough marketing of the event and team engagement with fans. There was over-reliance on Ronaldo as the draw of the event, and neglect of other big names such as Karim Benzema, N’Golo Kante, Joao Felix, Riyad Mahrez, Kingsley Coman and others. Still, it was great to witness Ronaldo in action at last.",
