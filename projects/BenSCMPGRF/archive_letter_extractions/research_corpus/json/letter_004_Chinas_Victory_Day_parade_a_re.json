  "content": "China has just marked the 80th anniversary of its victory in the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression. As memories settle, the conversation shifts from ceremony to responsibility: how history can inform a more stable, rules-based international order in an era of strategic competition and rapid technological change.\nChina’s wartime mobilisation tied down substantial portions of Japan’s fighting capability before the Pacific war widened the conflict across Asia. Domestic resistance made a significant contribution to the broader Allied effort.\nIn July 1945, China joined the Potsdam Declaration, underscoring the interconnectedness of wartime alliances and the emergence of a post-war international order, and Japan’s formal surrender in September 1945 closed a brutal chapter, with Victory Day on September 3 marking remembrance and resilience.",
