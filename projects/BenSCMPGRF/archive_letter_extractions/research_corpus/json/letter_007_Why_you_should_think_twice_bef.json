  "content": "The 2024-25 Hong Kong racing season closed on July 16, and the new season began on Sunday. As in the previous year, there will be 88 race days in total.\nBetting turnover for local events in 2024-25 exceeded HK$125.7 billion (US$16 billion), about a 3 per cent increase from the HK$121.9 billion recorded in 2023-24. Given the shrinking of the horse-racing industry worldwide, Hong Kong’s growing betting figures appear anomalous.\nLooking at Australia, the United States and Britain, one reason for the sport’s decline is the growing recognition of the cruelty involved in horse racing. Veterinary experts have long pointed out that forcing horses to sprint at maximum speed causes multiple health issues, including musculoskeletal injuries and internal bleeding.",
