The 2024-2026 theme, “Changing the Narrative on Suicide”, invites us to reduce stigma and foster open, supportive conversations. It asks us to move from silence and misunderstanding to empathy and connection, creating environments where people feel safe to speak up and seek help.\nOver the past year, we collaborated with Samaritans Befrienders Hong Kong and people bereaved by suicide – including some who have carried their grief for more than a decade – to publishAfar in Memory: Lives Unfinished. The book honours those we have lost and documents both the profound challenges and the possibility of growth during suicide bereavement. We hope that newly bereaved individuals can find companionship in these stories and feel encouraged to seek professional support when needed.",
