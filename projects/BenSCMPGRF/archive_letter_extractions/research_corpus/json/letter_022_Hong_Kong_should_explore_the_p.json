  "content": "For many people – whether they are older, or have mobility or sensory challenges – travelling can be complicated. In Hong Kong, efforts to improve accessibility have grown, but most still focus on mobility.\nLet’s widen the conversation: think about the last time you travelled. How much of that depended on sight?\nAt Beyond Vision International (BVI), we use tactile graphics with audio descriptions to help the visually impaired explore culture, art, architecture and communities.\nFor the visually impaired, accessibility is not just about reaching a destination, but experiencing it on equal terms. From appreciating a building’s history to noticing a painting’s smallest details, many travel experiences rely on sight – yet few attractions or guides address this gap.\nOver the past two years, BVI partnered with Kaifong Tour to create visual impairment-friendly guided tours of two local communities. The experience showed us that making Hong Kong more VI-friendly requires much more professional collaboration and resources: guide training in accessibility and description, accessible tactile materials for visualisation, community education and more.",
