  "title": "Do Trump and Putin remember how Alaska was peacefully sold in 1867?",
  "content": "In the light of Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin’s Alaska summit over the future of Ukraine, it may be worth considering an unusual, even intriguing historical parallel. Alaska’s peaceful transfer from Russia to the United States in 1867 is not often discussed in the context of today’s territorial conflicts.\nIndeed, the analogy is far from straightforward – Alaska was transferred by mutual agreement and purchase, whereas Ukraine’s contested regions have been seized and annexed through force, with their status fiercely disputed by all sides.\nStill, history can sometimes offer food for thought. The purchase of Alaska for US$7.2 million stands as a rare example of a major territorial change that was wrought without violence, through negotiation rather than war. In contrast, the proposed “land swaps” for Ukraine risk pressuring one side into making concessions and raise difficult questions about sovereignty, legitimacy and international law. There is no easy blueprint: international practice has long varied, and the voices and wishes of local populations have not always shaped outcomes.",
