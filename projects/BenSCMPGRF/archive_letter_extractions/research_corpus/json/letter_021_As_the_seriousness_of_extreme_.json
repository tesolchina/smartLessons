  "content": "Readers discuss how to respond to costly extreme weather events, the importance of brain health knowledge, and illegal renovation work\nOur city is often said to be a blessed place, since we are safe from the most devastating natural disasters. However, with climate change, extreme weather poses a growing threat to our safety. There is an urgent need to improve our climate resilience.\nFirstly, boost expertise in predicting extreme weather events and making more accurate forecasts ahead of time, especially among scientists at the Hong Kong Observatory. More exchanges with foreign scientists could align Hong Kong scientists with the best global practices and the latest in weather prediction technology. This would allow the general public to be better prepared for extreme weather, thus minimising property damage and shortening the city’s recovery time from floods and typhoons.\nThird, enhance the promotion of Hong Kong’s carbon-neutral policy through an extensive public education campaign on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Increased greenhouse gas and carbon emissions lead to global warming, which intensifies typhoons and downpours.",
