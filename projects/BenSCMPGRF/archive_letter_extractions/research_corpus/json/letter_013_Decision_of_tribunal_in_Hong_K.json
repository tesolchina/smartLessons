  "content": "On July 22, a Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal found against Kevin Yam Kin-fung for having engaged in conduct unbefitting of a solicitor, thereby compromising his integrity, his own reputation and the reputation of the profession, contrary to common law.\nThe tribunal found that Yam, on May 11, 2023, appeared via video link at a hearing of the United States Congressâ€™ Congressional-Executive Commission on China, as part of which Yam provided both oral and written testimony. In both testimonies, Yam identified himself as a Hong Kong legal professional who had practised law in the jurisdiction. In his testimony, Yam called for sanctions to be imposed by the United States government on judges and/or prosecutors in Hong Kong for their involvement in national security and/or politically related cases.\nThe tribunal ordered that Yam be struck off the roll of solicitors, meaning that Yam can no longer practise as a solicitor in Hong Kong.\nThis decision of the tribunal has caused an uproar in some Western legal circles. The critics, in my view, need to better understand the context.",
