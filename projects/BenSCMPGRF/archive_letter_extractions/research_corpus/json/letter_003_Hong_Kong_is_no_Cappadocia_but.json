  "content": "On Saturday, I attended the much-anticipated AIA International Hot Air Balloon Fest in Hong Kong. As someone who embraces the city’s vibrant event scene, my expectations were high. Yet what unfolded was a mixed experience.\nThe enchanting night glow of the hot air balloons lasted only a short time before all the balloons were deflated due to safety concerns and unsettled weather amid typhoon warnings. This brief spectacle left many frustrated.\nMeanwhile, the entertainment in the music zone felt somewhat one-dimensional, with predominantly Cantonese performances. For “Asia’s World City”, this limited cultural diversity seemed like a lost opportunity to achieve true international resonance.\nAnother disappointing moment was that, as far as I could tell, there was an absence of halal food options in the gourmet lane, although Hong Kong has been actively positioning itself as a Muslim-friendly tourist destination, achieving recognition this year as the “Most Promising Muslim-Friendly Destination of the Year” by CrescentRating.\nOne cannot help but question: what exactly makes this event “international”? The festival was promoted as Hong Kong’s first international hot air balloon event, featuring balloons from Canada, the United Kingdom, Malaysia and Japan. Yet, the cultural programme was overwhelmingly local.",
