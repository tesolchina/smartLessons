Hong Kong’s diversity is one of its greatest assets, with communities from South Asia, Africa, Europe and beyond contributing to the city’s vibrant culture.
The government centres catering to the city’s ethnic minorities provide services that help bridge gaps in education and employment, empowering individuals to participate more fully in society. Yet, as pointed out by your correspondent on August 5, their impact could be amplified by encouraging broader community participation.

Districts with diverse populations, like Yau Tsim Mong and Central and Western, already see organic cross-cultural exchanges in markets, restaurants and places of worship. Supporting these informal connections can strengthen social cohesion.
