Readers discuss the city’s gatekeeping ability, the water procurement scandal, and climate resilience
Hong Kong is my home, and I’m immensely proud of our legal infrastructure and work efficiency. However, I find the city to be struggling in law enforcement and gatekeeping, in several unforeseen cases.
Speaking as a secondary school teacher, it’s frustrating to see my students, who have put in enormous effort and time, having to compete with unqualified students. It appears that tutoring centres have found loopholes and are operating “shell schools” to help students secure local university placements. These “shell schools” should be subject to serious investigation.
Similarly, local reports on (and online videos of) someone jet-skiing all the way from the mainland into Victoria Harbour cast doubt on whether border control and maritime safety are being taken seriously.
