On July 22, a Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal found against Kevin Yam Kin-fung for having engaged in conduct unbefitting of a solicitor, thereby compromising his integrity, his own reputation and the reputation of the profession, contrary to common law.
The tribunal found that Yam, on May 11, 2023, appeared via video link at a hearing of the United States Congressâ€™ Congressional-Executive Commission on China, as part of which Yam provided both oral and written testimony. In both testimonies, Yam identified himself as a Hong Kong legal professional who had practised law in the jurisdiction. In his testimony, Yam called for sanctions to be imposed by the United States government on judges and/or prosecutors in Hong Kong for their involvement in national security and/or politically related cases.
The tribunal ordered that Yam be struck off the roll of solicitors, meaning that Yam can no longer practise as a solicitor in Hong Kong.
This decision of the tribunal has caused an uproar in some Western legal circles. The critics, in my view, need to better understand the context.
