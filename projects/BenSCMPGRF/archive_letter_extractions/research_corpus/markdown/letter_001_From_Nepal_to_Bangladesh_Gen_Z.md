Readers discuss the potential for youth movements to descend into chaos, and China’s developing ties with Iran
What unfolded in Nepal this month and in Bangladesh last year cannot be simply framed as a reflection of Gen Z’s heightened sense of conscience. While this generation is undeniably different, demanding freedom and flexibility and being exceptionally vocal about their rights, many are also deeply emotional and driven by passion. This emotional intensity, though powerful, can sometimes cloud judgment, especially when not grounded in historical context.
In both cases, Gen Z rallied for the right reasons, against censorship, corruption and inequality. But without structure and foresight, their movements devolved into anarchy. The poor remain poor, the economy suffers and the promise of change fades.
The next generation must learn from history. Passion must be paired with perspective. Protests must be organised, inclusive and rooted in a long-term vision. Otherwise, the ideals Gen Z fights for risk being undermined by the chaos that follows.
