But this is not polite company. We frequently take controversial, even offensive, positions on thorny topics. It would be easy to dismiss our discussions as the boneheaded joking of teenage boys, but for me, the common room is a laboratory where we test hypotheses for the world. Safe among trusted friends, I can say anything and my peers feel free to shoot my ideas down, agree, or help refine them by pointing out flaws in my arguments.
More than anywhere else, this setting helps me understand others’ views – and my own. The more time I spend in the adult world, the more I realise how anomalous this experience is.
Adults prioritise being inoffensive. When they reach an impasse, I often hear, “Let’s agree to disagree,” and the conversation ends. What a wasted opportunity to learn how someone else sees the world.
