No matter how we slice it, the decision is a step backward. Hong Kong has long prided itself on being outward-looking, modern and global. Yet this vote reinforces an impression of insularity at precisely the time the city can least afford it. The turmoil of 2019 and the subsequent national security crackdown have taken a toll on Hong Kong’s reputation internationally. Passing this bill would have been a chance to show that the city remains aligned with modern standards and earn genuine goodwill both locally and abroad. Instead, that opportunity was incomprehensibly squandered.
And, frankly, the arguments made to derail the bill weren’t particularly strong. Some lawmakers argued during the legislative process that formal recognition of same-sex couples undermines Chinese culture. This is a false premise. Sexual orientation is not a cultural phenomenon to be imported or rejected. It is a human reality, present across time, geography and tradition. By dismissing the lives of same-sex couples as merely foreign, Hong Kong diminishes its own people and writes them out of their own culture.
Recognising same-sex relationships would not have compromised Hong Kong’s cultural integrity nor its Chinese identity; it would have enriched it by reflecting the diversity that has always been part of this city’s story. A society confident in its heritage does not fear extending dignity to its minorities.
If Hong Kong is serious about retaining its place on the world stage, it must demonstrate not just economic vitality but also a higher degree of moral maturity.
