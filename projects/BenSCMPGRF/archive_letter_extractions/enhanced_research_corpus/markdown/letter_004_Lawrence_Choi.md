As a concerned resident, I am writing to urge immediate action to safeguard the rights of workers in Hong Kong. The policy of importing labour, particularly amid a rising unemployment rate, appears to be exacerbating the exploitation of local workers. The practice of suppressing wages and extending working hours for workers to maximise profits must be curbed. It is imperative to ensure the livelihoods and well-being of our workforce are not sacrificed so that Hong Kong can be a good home for all.
