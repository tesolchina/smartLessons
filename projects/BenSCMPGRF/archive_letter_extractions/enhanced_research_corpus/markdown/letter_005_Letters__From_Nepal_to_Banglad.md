What unfolded in Nepal this month and in Bangladesh last year cannot be simply framed as a reflection of Gen Z's heightened sense of conscience. While this generation is undeniably different, demanding freedom and flexibility and being exceptionally vocal about their rights, many are also deeply emotional and driven by passion. This emotional intensity, though powerful, can sometimes cloud judgment, especially when not grounded in historical context.
In Nepal, youth protests erupted after the government abruptly suspended 26 social media platforms. The move, widely seen as an attempt to silence dissent, triggered mass demonstrations. Years of economic stagnation, high youth unemployment and systemic corruption had left young Nepalis disillusioned. The protests began peacefully but later escalated after 19 people were killed in clashes with the police. Hundreds were injured. Government buildings and the homes of some political leaders were set ablaze. This tragic turn of events underscores a critical point: dissidence without clear leadership or agenda risks spiralling into chaos. The excessive use of force by authorities was unjustifiable, but so too was the destruction of public infrastructure. Many Gen Z protesters have since distanced themselves from the violence, but the damage has been done. Bangladesh offers another cautionary tale. After the country's prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, resigned on August 5, 2024, following mass student protests, the country descended into disorder. Despite the formation of an interim government, law and order remains somewhat fragile. The youth-led movement, though rooted in legitimate concerns, lacked strategic guidance and was ultimately hijacked.
In both cases, Gen Z rallied for the right reasons, against censorship, corruption and inequality. But without structure and foresight, their movements devolved into anarchy. The poor remain poor, the economy suffers and the promise of change fades.
The next generation must learn from history. Passion must be paired with perspective. Protests must be organised, inclusive and rooted in a long-term vision. Otherwise, the ideals Gen Z fights for risk being undermined by the chaos that follows.
