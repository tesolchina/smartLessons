On Saturday, I attended the much-anticipated AIA International Hot Air Balloon Fest in Hong Kong. As someone who embraces the city's vibrant event scene, my expectations were high. Yet what unfolded was a mixed experience.
The enchanting night glow of the hot air balloons lasted only a short time before all the balloons were deflated due to safety concerns and unsettled weather amid typhoon warnings. This brief spectacle left many frustrated.
Meanwhile, the entertainment in the music zone felt somewhat one-dimensional, with predominantly Cantonese performances. For "Asia's World City", this limited cultural diversity seemed like a lost opportunity to achieve true international resonance.
Another disappointing moment was that, as far as I could tell, there was an absence of halal food options in the gourmet lane, although Hong Kong has been actively positioning itself as a Muslim-friendly tourist destination, achieving recognition this year as the "Most Promising Muslim-Friendly Destination of the Year" by CrescentRating.
One cannot help but question: what exactly makes this event "international"? The festival was promoted as Hong Kong's first international hot air balloon event, featuring balloons from Canada, the United Kingdom, Malaysia and Japan. Yet, the cultural programme was overwhelmingly local.
The focal attraction – the tethered balloon rides – was not covered by the entry tickets and, in any case, the rides did not go ahead due to licensing failures and safety concerns. This sparked public backlash and demands for refunds from those who had bought tickets. The Hong Kong Tourism Board retreated from promoting the event to stem reputational damage and the government emphasised its non-involvement in funding or organising the event.
