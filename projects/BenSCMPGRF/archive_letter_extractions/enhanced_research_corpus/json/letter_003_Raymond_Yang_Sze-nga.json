  "content": "The Education Bureau's \"Start the New School Year Full of Energy\" initiative and the 4Rs Mental Health Charter – rest, relaxation, relationship and resilience – deserve recognition. These resources highlight the importance of supporting students' well-being as they face the transitions and stresses of a new academic year. They also send a welcome signal that mental health is now firmly on Hong Kong's education agenda.\nYet, for the 4Rs Charter to move from posters into practice, one critical prerequisite must not be overlooked: the well-being of teachers themselves. The research is clear. As Professor Marc Brackett of Yale University, who studies social and emotional learning (SEL), recently noted: \"If SEL doesn't live in the adults, it dies in the curriculum.\" Studies consistently show that teacher well-being and classroom climate are linked. When teachers regulate their emotions, model healthy coping and co-regulate with students, emotional safety spreads. When teacher well-being is ignored, even the most evidence-based curricula falter.\nOur frontline experience at Just Feel echoes this. Through our Compassionate School Programme, we support partner schools in cultivating compassionate school cultures. The starting point is always the adults. Teachers are first invited to practise self-compassion, strengthen their own regulation skills and experience being empathised with before guiding students. Without this foundation, efforts to build resilience and empathy in children remain superficial.\nInternational frameworks reinforce this message. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Teaching Compass places teacher well-being – physical, socio-emotional and cognitive – as the very anchor of teacher agency and professional competence. Crucially, it links the well-being of teachers to the same shared future vision as that of students: well-being for individuals, society and the planet. In other words, caring for teachers is inseparable from preparing the next generation to thrive.\nTo make the 4Rs Charter a lived reality, Hong Kong must therefore complement student-focused campaigns with a systemic, preventive and whole-school commitment to educators. This means allocating time for teacher reflection and self-care, embedding compassionate communication and social-emotional learning into professional development, and ensuring that school leaders actively prioritise staff well-being.\nBy investing in teachers as whole human beings, we lay the groundwork for resilient classrooms and compassionate school communities. In doing so, the 4Rs Charter will not only support students in adjusting to a new school year, but also shape a generation ready to meet the future with compassion.",
