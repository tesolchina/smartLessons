there are many folders projects under /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/projects

I wonder if we can separate project data from tools /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/DailyAssistant/operating 

the tools can be updated and called from a separate place from the project folder

when I work on a project I just need to open one folder here 

any suggestions how this might work 

the tool folder will be synced to github but the project folders can be synced via Google drive

### Draft Reply Email

Subject: Re: Letters to the Editor Symposium and Exhibition – Materials Received & Next Steps

Hi [Sender Name],

Thank you for the message and the attached questions for panel members.

Quick update on our side:

1. A dedicated Drive sub-folder has been created for the symposium and the materials have been organized there.
2. A collaborative Google Doc (comment access enabled for anyone with the link) has been set up for ongoing discussion and planning:
   https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zNXRwDW05Ok_UrPk053pr3NX0hd949Tq28VjJuebhBk/edit
3. An initial structured execution plan (objectives, workstreams, timeline, risks, and next 7-day actions) has been generated and appended to that document for team review.
4. The panel question document has been converted into Markdown for easier inline referencing.

Next proposed actions:

- Please review the “Immediate Next 7 Days” and “Open Questions” sections in the doc.
- Let me know any confirmed speaker names, venue constraints, or branding guidelines so we can tighten the plan.
- If there are any additional materials (previous year examples, media partners, confirmed participants), feel free to drop them into the same folder.

Once I have your confirmations, I’ll refine the risk register and timeline granularity (especially October milestones) and prepare a lightweight comms/promotion tracker.

Best,
[Your Name]

### Personalized Reply (Simon → Ben & Pui Yin)

Subject: Re: Letters to the Editor Symposium and Exhibition – Aligning Tasks & Next Steps

Hi Ben, hi Pui Yin,

Thanks Ben for the detailed breakdown – really helpful, and the structure looks solid. I’ve set up the shared planning Google Doc and added an initial execution plan (timeline, workstreams, risks, and immediate next actions). We can iterate quickly there:
[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zNXRwDW05Ok_UrPk053pr3NX0hd949Tq28VjJuebhBk/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zNXRwDW05Ok_UrPk053pr3NX0hd949Tq28VjJuebhBk/edit)

Quick reflections + proposed confirmations:

1. Intro segment (20 min): I suggest we storyboard this by early October – I can draft an outline once we have provisional exhibition title + confirmed roundtable participants.
2. GCAP student sharing: I’ll start a shortlist outreach thread – Ben, once you hear back from any early confirmations let me know so we avoid duplicate nudges.
3. Round table: Once letters + explanations start coming in, I can help cluster themes to tighten moderation flow.
4. Exhibition mounting: Once the library proposes their design template, happy to review layout narrative for coherence.
5. Registration: Pui Yin – if you prefer Qualtrics, I can assist with field design (thinking: name, affiliation, role, optional interest tags for follow‑up network formation).

Task Alignment (echoing + minor refinements):

- Participant outreach & letter selection narrative – Ben (I can help structure any follow-up template if useful).
- Exhibition + symposium title – Trio (suggest we add 3–5 candidate titles to the doc this week and vote).
- Poster workflow – Ben + library (loop me in for final messaging polish if needed).
- GCAP student invites – Simon + Ben (I’ll draft a short invite blurb; Ben to receive replies).
- Registration form – Pui Yin + Ben (target draft before end of October; earlier OK if capacity allows).
- Student helpers – Ben + Simon (let’s define micro-roles: liaison, tech floor, timekeeper, guest welcome).
- CCL registration – Ben (flag if any supporting rationale text needed; I can review quickly).
- Distinguished guests / SCMP / CPRO – Ben + Simon (I’ll draft a concise positioning paragraph for outreach if helpful).
- Exhibition mounting – Library (we’ll support on captions consistency / sequencing once mockups exist).

Immediate Next Micro-Actions (next 7 days):

1. Draft & shortlist exhibition/symposium title candidates.
2. Create outreach template for participant letter selection (with word/character guidance for their explanation snippet).
3. Start GCAP student invite list + message draft.
4. Add preliminary risk severity ratings in the Google Doc (I’ll do first pass).
5. Confirm preferred registration platform (Google Form vs Qualtrics) – to avoid late pivot.

Open Clarifications:

- Do we want a post-event brief or media summary prepared in advance (skeleton)?
- Any preference for whether the exhibition narrative is chronological, thematic, or hybrid?
- Should we consider a quiet capture (photo/interview) slot before or after the round table?

Let me know if any adjustments needed. I’ll keep iterating the shared plan as inputs arrive. This reply was drafted with AI assistance and lightly reviewed before sending.

Best,
Simon
