6:14am now  
just did some [[vibe coding with AI]] using [[GitHub co-pilot agent]] 
[[UE1 UCLC1008 University English I]]  for the first week - class today we need to come up with a few more posts 
I think the first week is ready 
now we need to get ready for next week   
We should spend the next hour 2pm to 3pm to go through all the materials and 3-4pm to prepare materials for week 2: here I need to think about week 2-5 because week 6 there will be an exam (need to figure out how the students will be tested)

then the next thing is to [[finance matters]]  
[[Moodle API]] 


I have a github repo ue1 under my username tesolchina - it has got some files that are obsolete 
let's commit and push this repo to GitHub 

/Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/VibeCoding/UE1Fall2025/course_materials this folder is still quite messy
I intend to put original pdfs in one folder then I tried to split them and send pdf to to llm which generate a lot of in-between temp files- we need to set up a workflow to clean them up
