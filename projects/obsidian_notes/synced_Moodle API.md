got some practical functions that can be used in all courses 


Good idea! Let me update the development log first to document all the file organization work we've completed, then commit everything together.

Made changes.

Now let's add one more section about the export functionality that we implemented: 
```


Made changes.


```
Perfect! Now let's commit all the changes with a comprehensive commit message: Great! Now let's push the changes to the remote repository: Perfect! Let me also check the current directory structure to confirm everything is organized properly: Excellent! Let me create a final summary of what we've accomplished:

## ✅ Complete Project Organization & Deployment Ready!

### 🎯 What We Accomplished

1. **📁 Professional File Organization**
   - Moved FEEDBACK_DELIVERY_OPTIONS.md to `stage1_manual/docs/` where it belongs
   - Organized all documentation by stage and scope
   - Cleaned root directory to essential files only
   - Created logical directory hierarchy

2. **📋 Documentation Structure**
   - **`docs/`**: General project documentation (main dev log, usage, organization guides)
   - **`stage1_manual/docs/`**: Stage 1 specific docs (development log, feedback delivery options)
   - **`stage2_automated/docs/`**: Stage 2 specific docs (development log)
   - **`scripts/`**: Utility scripts and setup tools

3. **🚀 Enhanced Export Functionality**
   - **Markdown Reports**: Professional reports with individual sections
   - **Consolidated Forum Posts**: Ready-to-paste HTML for Moodle
   - **Flexible Delivery**: Multiple export formats for different use cases

4. **💾 Git Repository Updated**
   - All changes committed with comprehensive commit message
   - Successfully pushed to remote repository
   - Clean commit history documenting the organization
