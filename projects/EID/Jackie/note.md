background 

we are developing some customised chatbots for an eduction course. 

a system prompt has been drafted. 

we need to revise the system prompt and turn it into a json file 

we should send the info, instructions and the system prompt and json file to the LLM and expect a revised json file
we'll then deploy it in our platform
