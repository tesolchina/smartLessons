# Intro content setup (teacher-facing)

Use this as a checklist to tailor the Intro tab for your course.

## 1) Purpose and expectations
- In 2–3 sentences, explain what the chatbot helps students practise.
- Describe expected tone (respectful, academic) and how responses are used.

## 2) Email usage note
- If the chatbot emails a summary report, state clearly:
  - Students should provide their own email address.
  - The purpose of collecting the address (sending the report only).
  - Whether the email is stored anywhere and for how long.
- If email is optional, say what happens if it’s omitted.

## 3) Syllabus snapshot
- Add 3–6 bullets that reflect near-term learning outcomes or weekly themes.
- Optionally add a link to a full syllabus or course site.

## 4) Data & privacy
- Remind students not to include sensitive personal data in free text.
- If applicable, add a link to your privacy policy or institutional guidance.

## 5) Technical tips
- If the iframe is blocked on campus networks, recommend the “Open in new tab” button.
- Suggest using the latest Chrome/Edge/Safari.

## 6) Contact
- Provide a course contact or office hour details (optional).
- You can also set a `contactEmail` in `config.json` and display it in the intro.
