The English for Research Publication Purposes programme has been operated since 2017 or 2018 - we need to locate the relevant data

the main purpose is to assist research students to publish papers in international journals.

We also engage research students to serve as peer tutors to help run seminars and workshops and pay them as student assistants 

teachers serve as tutors and collect teaching hours 

the exact no of hours we have for eac AY is different 

in recent years we have fewer students enrolled in the programme due to the advent of Gen AI as well as lack of publicity and promotional efforts

In the new AY 25-26, we should try to promote the programme a bit more in line with the university's policy to ensure best student exp and to support impactful research activities 

we plan to run more workshops and seminars related to Gen AI 

we also need to set up a new web page for the programme to promote it more effectively
