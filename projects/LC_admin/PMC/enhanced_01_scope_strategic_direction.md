# Section 1: Scope of Activities and Strategic Direction

## Summary
The Language Center demonstrates clear mission alignment with strong leadership and effective committee structures. DAA praised the successful accomplishment of mission objectives through three competencies: cognitive, interpersonal/cross-cultural, and intrapersonal. Key recommendations focus on multilingualism requirements, English proficiency indicators, and AI competency integration.

---

## DAA Observations
The LC's mission, along with its objectives, and strategic direction, is crystally clear: educating HKBU students to become competent language users and effective communicators with three competencies:
- Cognitive competence
- Interpersonal/cross-cultural competence  
- Intrapersonal competence

### Success Factors
- Strong and effective leadership team
- Highly energetic staff fully dedicated to mission fulfillment
- Excellent work of various committees (PMC and Curriculum Committees deserve special mention)
- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) aligned with University's Institutional Strategic Plan

### KPIs Cover 5 Areas:
1. Cognitive and communicative competency and teaching effectiveness
2. Interpersonal and cross-cultural competency
3. Intrapersonal competency
4. Innovative pedagogies including AI-assisted language learning
5. Staff development

## ACP Follow-up
The ACP made no recommendations or suggestions in this area.

## Benchmarking
No truly equivalent unit exists in US universities - LC performs functions typically provided by several different units:
- English courses (UE1/UE2) typically taught by English Department
- Foreign language courses usually offered by Department of Modern Languages
- LEP courses typically offered by English Language Institute/Language Center

Despite diverse functions, LC quality and scope meets/exceeds US university standards.

## DAA Recommendations

### 1. Multilingual Language Requirement
Given HKBU's language policy shift from trilingualism to multilingualism, suggest requiring students to learn one other language (French, German, Japanese, Spanish) in addition to required 3 hours of Chinese.

### 2. English Proficiency Indicator
Recommend adopting minimum IELTS/TOEFL score as graduation indicator:
- IELTS score of 6.5 or TOEFL iBT score of 79
- **Note:** This will be an indicator, not a graduation requirement

### 3. AI Competency Integration
Recommend LC's PILOs and CILOs explicitly list AI competency as required competency within Cognitive and Communicative Competency.

## LC Response

### Multilingual Learning Support
- Welcome recommendation as multilingualism is key component of University's Graduate Attributes
- Current model makes foreign language learning critical part of intercultural/exchange experiences
- 2,000+ students annually enroll in LC credit-bearing foreign language courses
- **New AY 2025-26 incentive:** Refund policy for students taking supplementary foreign-language courses meeting attendance requirements

### English Proficiency Tracking
- Senate-approved policy from AY 2025/26: percentage of students achieving minimum IELTS 6.5 or TOEFL iBT 79 will be key indicator
- Used for tracking English proficiency, not as graduation requirement

### AI Competency Implementation
- All LC credit-bearing courses updated (some pending procedural approval) to include AI competency development as CILO
- E-tools including AI actively integrated into classroom activities
- Enhanced student learning experience through technological tool integration for independent language learning
