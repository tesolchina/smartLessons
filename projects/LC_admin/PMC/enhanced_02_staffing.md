# Section 2: Staffing

## Summary
LC teaching staff are highly qualified with doctoral degrees and extensive experience, but face higher teaching loads (17 hours/week vs US standard 12 hours/week). ACP recommendations on hiring full-time staff have been implemented. Key challenges include LEP manpower shortage and need for teaching load review.

## Resources

### DAA Observations
- Teaching staff are highly competent with excellent credentials
- Many possess doctoral degrees in language study areas
- Extensive tertiary-level teaching experience
- High staff morale and energy
- **Issue:** Average teaching load higher than HKBU units and US universities
- Some sections lack adequate staff (especially LEP)

### LEP Staffing Challenge
- Fall 2024: 225 students signed up for LEP service
- Only able to serve 50 students
- One-on-one service in high demand
- Insufficient manpower to meet demand

### ACP Follow-up
**ACP Made Two Recommendations (2022):**
1. "LC strike a balance with more full-time staff hired for monitoring course quality and coordination of teaching for consistent practices, particularly for foreign language courses"
2. "Teaching load of staff of LC be reviewed to ensure comparability with rest of University"

**LC Actions Taken:**
1. **Hiring Response:** Hired four full-time lecturers to oversee French, German, Japanese and Spanish language courses
2. **Teaching Load Review:** Waiting for VP of T&L office to conduct review (LC became teaching unit under VP T&L office in July 2024)

### Benchmarking
- Typical US university teaching load: 12 hours per week
- LC average: 17 hours per week (significantly higher)

### DAA Recommendations
VP of T&L office should:
1. Conduct review of teaching load issue as soon as possible
2. Find ways to provide more manpower and resources to LEP

### LC Response
- Teaching hours set at 238 per semester (model established 2009 to ensure teacher commitment)
- Recognize importance of balancing teaching quality with staff well-being
- Will relate issue to senior management
- LEP resources will be optimized for higher efficiency
- Welcome continuation of VPTL Office review for sustainability
