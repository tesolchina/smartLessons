# Assessment Rubrics for AI-Assisted Writing Platform

## Overview

This document contains the assessment rubrics used for evaluating student performance in the AI-assisted writing platform. The platform uses two complementary rubric systems:

1. **AI Interaction Rubric** - Evaluates how effectively students collaborate with AI
2. **Writing Quality Rubric** - Evaluates the actual writing improvement and quality

## AI Interaction Rubric (Primary Assessment)

This rubric specifically evaluates student performance in using AI as a collaborative writing tool. **Total Weight: 100%**

### Criteria A: In-Depth Conversation with AI (33% weight)

| Score | Performance Level | Description |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| **1** | **Limited** | No exchanges or chat history provided; no conversation beyond initial input; no questions asked |
| **2** | **Basic** | Sparse exchanges with incomplete or no chat history; basic conversation with one or two simple questions; lacks depth |
| **3** | **Developing** | Adequate exchanges shown in chat history; moderate conversation with some relevant questions; shows some depth |
| **4** | **Proficient** | Robust exchanges with comprehensive chat history; in-depth conversation with detailed, relevant questions on all levels |
| **5** | **Excellent** | Extensive exchanges with thorough, well-documented chat history; highly in-depth conversation with insightful, multi-level questions |

**What to Look For:**
- **Context Setting**: Does the student explain the assignment, rubric, and goals to the AI?
- **Strategic Questioning**: Are questions focused and purposeful rather than random?
- **Sustained Engagement**: Does the conversation develop over multiple exchanges?
- **Depth of Inquiry**: Do questions demonstrate understanding and critical thinking?

| **2** | **Basic** | Most AI suggestions accepted with little critical analysis |
| **3** | **Developing** | Some AI suggestions evaluated; partial critical review with justification |
| **4** | **Proficient** | Most AI suggestions critically assessed; clear justification for choices |
| **5** | **Excellent** | All AI suggestions thoroughly evaluated; strong, evidence-based justification |

**What to Look For:**
- **Questioning Suggestions**: Does the student ask "Why?" or request explanations?
- **Rubric Alignment**: Do they check suggestions against grading criteria?
- **Independent Judgment**: Do they reject inappropriate suggestions?

### Criteria C: Refining Process (34% weight)

| Score | Performance Level | Description |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| **1** | **Limited** | No revisions made |
| **2** | **Basic** | Minimal revisions with no iterative process |
| **3** | **Developing** | Some revisions with limited iteration based on AI feedback |
| **4** | **Proficient** | Clear iterative process with multiple revisions based on AI input |
| **5** | **Excellent** | Extensive refinement with critical review of AI feedback at each step |

**What to Look For:**
- **Implementation Quality**: Are changes actually made to the essay?
- **Personal Agency**: Does the student do the editing themselves?
- **Iterative Improvement**: Is there evidence of multiple revision cycles?
- **Strategic Enhancement**: Do revisions address the most important issues first?

| **4** | **Proficient** | Ideas are relevant and solid; good awareness of the issue concerned; clear viewpoint with some depth |
| **5** | **Excellent** | Ideas are insightful and highly relevant; strong awareness of the issue concerned; well-developed, compelling viewpoint |

### Organization and Logical Progression  

| Score | Performance Level | Description |
|-------|------------------|-------------|

## Grading Scale and Conversion

### AI Interaction Rubric Scoring
- **Total Points**: 15 (5 points maximum per criterion Ã— 3 criteria)
- **Grade Conversion**:
  - 13-15 points = A (Excellent)
  - 11-12 points = B (Proficient) 
  - 9-10 points = C (Developing)
  - 7-8 points = D (Basic)
  - 5-6 points = F (Limited)

### Combined Assessment Approach
For comprehensive evaluation, instructors may consider:
1. **Primary Assessment**: AI Interaction Rubric (determines main grade)
2. **Supporting Evidence**: Writing Quality improvement (confirms learning)
3. **Holistic Review**: Overall demonstration of AI literacy skills

## Assessment Guidelines for Instructors

### Reviewing Student Performance

1. **Read the Full Conversation**: Review the complete AI chat history for context
2. **Compare Drafts**: Examine original vs. revised essay for improvement evidence  
3. **Apply Rubric Systematically**: Score each criterion independently
4. **Look for Patterns**: Identify consistent strengths and areas for development
5. **Consider Context**: Account for student's starting skill level and assignment complexity

### Common Performance Indicators

**Excellent Performance (4-5 points)**:
- Extensive, thoughtful AI conversations
- Clear evidence of strategic planning
- Consistent critical evaluation of suggestions
- Significant essay improvement through iterative revision

**Proficient Performance (3-4 points)**:
- Adequate AI interaction with some depth
- Some evidence of planning and strategy
- Occasional critical evaluation of suggestions
- Noticeable essay improvement with good use of AI guidance

**Developing Performance (2-3 points)**:
- Basic AI interaction with limited depth
