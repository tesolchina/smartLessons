Many people think that what individuals do is not important compared to what governments and companies do. I disagree with this statement because individual actions are also important for fighting climate change.\n\nFirst, governments and companies have more power to make big changes. Governments can make laws about pollution and energy use. For example, they can ban plastic bags or make rules for factories. Companies can also change how they make products and use less energy. These actions affect many people at the same time, so they are very powerful.\n\nHowever, individual actions are still important. When many people do small things, it becomes big. For instance, if everyone uses less electricity at home, it saves a lot of energy. People can also buy products from companies that care about the environment. This makes companies want to be more green because they want to sell their products.\n\nAlso, individual actions can influence governments.
