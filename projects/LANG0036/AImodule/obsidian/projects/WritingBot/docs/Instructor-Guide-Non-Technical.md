## Student Skills Framework

### Skill 1: Contextual AI Communication
**What This Means**: Students learn to provide AI with sufficient background information for effective assistance.

**Expected Student Behaviors**:
- **Introduce the assignment**: "I'm working on an argumentative essay for my English class..."
- **Explain the context**: "This essay will be graded based on specific criteria including..."
- **Share the rubric**: "The assessment focuses on argument structure, evidence use, and writing clarity..."
- **State objectives**: "I want to improve my essay's coherence and strengthen my arguments..."

**Why This Matters**: AI provides better assistance when it understands the full context, just like human tutors do.

### Skill 2: Strategic Revision Planning
**What This Means**: Students learn to prioritize improvements and make strategic decisions about revision focus.

**Expected Student Behaviors**:
- **Assess current essay**: "What are the main weaknesses in my essay?"
- **Prioritize improvements**: "Given limited time, which areas should I focus on first?"
- **Create action plan**: "Let's work on improving my thesis statement, then move to paragraph transitions..."
- **Set realistic goals**: "I want to focus on three main areas for improvement..."

**Why This Matters**: Effective revision requires strategic thinking, not random changes.

### Skill 3: Exemplar-Based Learning  
**What This Means**: Students learn to use high-quality examples as reference points for improvement.

**Expected Student Behaviors**:
- **Identify good examples**: "Here's an essay I think demonstrates strong argumentation..."
- **Request comparative analysis**: "How does my essay compare to this example?"
- **Seek specific guidance**: "What techniques from this example could improve my writing?"
- **Apply learned patterns**: "Can you help me restructure my paragraph using this model?"

**Why This Matters**: Learning from exemplars helps students understand quality standards concretely.

### Skill 4: Critical Evaluation of AI Suggestions
**What This Means**: Students learn to thoughtfully evaluate AI recommendations rather than blindly accepting them.

**Expected Student Behaviors**:
- **Request explanations**: "Why do you suggest changing this sentence?"
- **Check against rubric**: "How does this suggestion align with the grading criteria?"
- **Question recommendations**: "I'm not sure this change fits my argument. Can you explain further?"
- **Seek alternatives**: "Are there other ways to improve this paragraph?"

**Why This Matters**: Critical thinking prevents over-reliance on AI and maintains academic integrity.

### Skill 5: Collaborative Implementation
**What This Means**: Students learn to implement AI suggestions through their own editing rather than copying AI-generated text.

**Expected Student Behaviors**:
- **Request guidance, not rewrites**: "How can I improve this paragraph?" (not "Rewrite this paragraph")
- **Implement personally**: Student makes actual changes to their draft
- **Maintain voice**: Preserves their original writing style and perspective
- **Verify improvements**: Checks that changes actually improve the essay

**Why This Matters**: Students must remain the authors of their work while using AI as a collaborative tool.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### About Academic Integrity
**Q: Is using AI for writing assistance considered cheating?**
A: No, when used properly. Students are learning to collaborate with AI while maintaining authorship. The platform teaches responsible AI use, not replacement of student thinking.

**Q: How do we ensure students aren't just copying AI-generated text?**
A: The platform emphasizes guidance over generation. Students request suggestions and implement changes themselves. The conversation history shows whether they're collaborating appropriately.

### About Assessment Validity
**Q: How do we know the assessment accurately measures student ability?**
A: The rubric evaluates process (how students interact with AI) as much as product (essay improvement). This demonstrates both AI literacy and writing skills.

**Q: What if students perform differently in training vs. assessment?**
A: This is normal and expected. Training mode provides scaffolding; assessment mode evaluates independent capability. Both serve important educational purposes.

### About Implementation
**Q: What if students struggle with the technology?**
A: The platform is designed for non-technical users. Focus on educational objectives rather than technical details. Provide basic navigation support as needed.

**Q: How much time should instructors expect to spend on this?**
A: Initial briefing (30 min), optional training session observation (45-60 min), and assessment report review (10-15 min per student). Total: approximately 2-3 hours per class.
