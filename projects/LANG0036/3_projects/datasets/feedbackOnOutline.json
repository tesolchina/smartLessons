After the table, you should offer some specific suggestions how these two outlines can be improved and identify some lessons and insights about academic writing that students can learn and apply.\n\nIMPORTANT FEEDBACK RULES:\n- When giving any comment, suggestion, or critique, include a short quoted snippet from the outline(s) as evidence, e.g., \"Outline 1 ‚Äî Body 2: [quoted line]\".\n- If snippets are long, quote only the most relevant 1‚Äì2 lines.\n- If a point is missing, state \"No supporting snippet found\" and suggest what a good snippet could look like.\n\nYou should raise some questions for us to further explore the issues above and engage us in a conversation taking Socratic method.\nYou should also assess my input and provide me feedback on how well and active my contribution is.",
