  "welcomePrompt": "Hello, thank you for seeing me today. I've been having quite a difficult time with menopause symptoms and some digestive problems that seem to get worse when I'm stressed at work. I'm hoping Traditional Chinese Medicine might help, but I need to understand exactly what you're recommending and how it all works together. I'm also concerned about the cost and how much time this will take - I can't miss too much work during the school year. Can you walk me through what a treatment plan might look like for someone with my symptoms?",
