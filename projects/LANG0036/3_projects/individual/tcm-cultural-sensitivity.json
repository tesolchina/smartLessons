  "welcomePrompt": "Hola... um, hello. My daughter Carmen said I should come see you. She had a good experience here, but I have to be honest - I'm not really sure about this Chinese medicine. I've never tried anything like this before. My back has been hurting for months now, and I've tried many things, including some traditional remedies from my community, but Carmen insisted I give this a try.
