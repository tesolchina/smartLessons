  "welcomePrompt": "Look, I need to be straight with you. I've been coming here for three months now, spending good money that I don't really have, and I'm not seeing the results you promised me. My back still hurts just as much as when I started, maybe worse some days. My wife is asking why I keep throwing money at this when the physical therapist I saw last year at least gave me some relief. I'm starting to think this whole Traditional Chinese Medicine thing just doesn't work for people like me. Before I waste any more time and money, I need you to tell me honestly - is this actually going to help, or should I just go back to my regular doctor and get some real pain medication?",
