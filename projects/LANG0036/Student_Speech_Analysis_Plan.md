## 🔬 **Technical Analysis Plan Using Essentia.js**

### **Phase 1: Basic Audio Characteristics**
```javascript
// 1. Audio Quality Assessment
- Sample rate and duration analysis
- RMS energy levels (volume consistency)
- Dynamic range measurement
- Background noise detection
```

### **Phase 2: Prosodic Analysis** 
```javascript
// 2. Pitch and Intonation Features
- PitchYinProbabilistic: Extract fundamental frequency
- Pitch contour visualization for question/statement patterns
- Stress pattern identification
- Emotional expression through pitch variation
```

### **Phase 3: Spectral Analysis**
```javascript
// 3. Pronunciation Quality Indicators
- MFCC extraction for vowel quality assessment
- SpectralCentroid for voice clarity
- SpectralContrast for consonant distinction
- Formant-like characteristics for accent analysis
```

### **Phase 4: Temporal Analysis**
```javascript
// 4. Fluency and Timing Metrics
- Speech rate calculation (syllables/words per minute)
- Pause detection and classification
- Hesitation marker identification ("uh", "maybe", "and")
- Turn-taking and discourse flow analysis
```

## 📊 **Specific Analysis Targets from Transcript**

### **Identified Speech Patterns**
1. **🔄 Repetition Patterns**: "maybe", "and", "I think" (discourse markers)
2. **⏸️ Hesitation Markers**: "uh", false starts, self-corrections
3. **🎯 Content Themes**: Reusable bags, food waste, environmental protection
4. **📝 Grammatical Features**: Simple present tense, modal verbs ("can", "will")

### **Pronunciation Targets**
1. **Vowel Sounds**: Analysis of /eɪ/ in "waste", /aɪ/ in "buy"
2. **Consonant Clusters**: "plastic", "products", "consumption"  
3. **Word Stress**: "sustainable", "environment", "consumption"
4. **Sentence Stress**: Emphasis on key content words

### **Prosodic Features**
1. **Intonation Patterns**: Rising tone on uncertain statements
2. **Rhythm**: Evidence of L1 influence on English rhythm
3. **Pausing**: Strategic vs. hesitation pauses
4. **Volume Variation**: Confidence indicators
