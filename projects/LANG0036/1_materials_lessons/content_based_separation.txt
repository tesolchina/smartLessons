# CONTENT-BASED SPEAKER SEPARATION PLAN

## 1. SPEAKER ATTRIBUTION BREAKDOWN

### Simon Wang Sections (Primary Instructor)
- **Chunk 1**: Complete chunk (100%)
  - Course administration
  - Course structure
  - Learning management system
  - Group formation

- **Chunk 3**: Complete chunk (100%)
  - VS Code setup
  - Python environment
  - Technical instructions
  - Course logistics

- **Chunk 4**: Complete chunk (100%)
  - Software setup details
  - GitHub Copilot instructions
  - Classroom management
  - Technical support

### Talia Sections (Questionnaire Expert)
- **Chunk 2**: Majority portion (~70%)
  - Survey question design
  - Attitude measurement methodology
  - Policy perception questions
  - Ordinal scales explanation

### Mixed Sections Requiring Separation
- **Chunk 2**: Contains both speakers
  - Talia: Survey methodology content
  - Simon: Administrative interruption (~30%)
  - Clear transition point at "Sorry to interrupt..."

## 2. QUESTIONNAIRE METHODOLOGY CONTENT

### Primary Questionnaire Content (Attribute to Talia)
Located primarily in Chunk 2:
- Survey question design principles
- Attitude measurement techniques
- Policy perception question methodology
- Ordinal scale explanations
- CSV file data structure discussion

### Related References (Context Only)
- Brief mentions in Chunks 3 & 4 about questionnaire data, but in technical context (keep with Simon)

## 3. TRANSITION POINTS

### Natural Speaker Transitions
1. **Start → Chunk 1**: Simon Wang (Course Introduction)
2. **Chunk 1 → Chunk 2**: Transition to Talia (Survey Methodology)
3. **Within Chunk 2**: 
   - Talia → Simon ("Sorry to interrupt...")
   - Simon → Talia ("Okay. So later in the CSV file...")
4. **Chunk 2 → Chunk 3**: Return to Simon (Technical Setup)
5. **Chunks 3 & 4**: Continuous Simon Wang content

## 4. FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Confidence Assessment
- **HIGH CONFIDENCE** in overall separation
- Clear content distinction between:
  - Technical/administrative content (Simon)
  - Survey methodology content (Talia)

### Manual Review Requirements
- **Priority Review**: Chunk 2 transitions
  - Verify clean break points
  - Ensure context maintenance during switches

### Implementation Approach

1. **Initial Separation**
   - Create two base transcripts (Simon & Talia)
   - Use chunk boundaries as primary division points

2. **Chunk 2 Processing**
   - Carefully separate based on identified transition points
   - Maintain context during speaker switches
   - Ensure smooth flow between segments

3. **Quality Control**
   - Review all transitions for natural flow
   - Verify technical content stays with Simon
   - Confirm questionnaire methodology stays with Talia

4. **Final Documentation**
   - Mark clear speaker changes in transcript
   - Add context notes where needed
   - Include timestamps at transition points

### Additional Notes
- Maintain all technical setup and course administration under Simon
- Keep all survey methodology content under Talia
- Preserve classroom management elements with Simon
- Ensure references to each other's content remain contextually appropriate
