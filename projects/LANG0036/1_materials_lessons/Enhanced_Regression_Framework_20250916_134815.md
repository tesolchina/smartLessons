I'll help create a comprehensive revision addressing all feedback points. Let me structure this systematically.

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF CHANGES

The regression analysis framework has been substantially enhanced to address key concerns while maintaining its practical utility. Major improvements include:

1. **Methodological Rigor**
- Added robust endogeneity controls and instrumental variables
- Enhanced model specifications with non-linear relationships
- Implemented comprehensive validation procedures

2. **Statistical Power**
- Increased sample size requirements based on power analysis
- Added detailed sampling strategies
- Enhanced multilevel modeling approach

3. **Implementation Feasibility**
- Developed phased data collection strategy
- Added specific resource requirements
- Created detailed quality control procedures

4. **Policy Integration**
- Strengthened connection to Hong Kong transit policies
- Enhanced cost-benefit framework
- Added equity considerations

## DETAILED REVISION LOG

### Methodology Improvements

**CHANGE:** Model Specification - Added instrumental variables approach
**RATIONALE:** Address endogeneity concerns in waiting time models
**IMPACT:** Improved causal inference and estimation accuracy

```r
# First Stage
Bus_Frequency = γ₀ + γ₁(RainfallShock) + γ₂(Controls) + υ

# Second Stage
Waiting_Time = β₀ + β₁(Predicted_Bus_Frequency) + β₂(Controls) + ε
```

**CHANGE:** Sample Size - Increased to 2000+ observations
**RATIONALE:** Power analysis showed need for larger sample
**IMPACT:** Enhanced statistical power and reliability

**CHANGE:** Non-linear Specifications - Added quadratic terms
**RATIONALE:** Account for diminishing returns in key relationships
**IMPACT:** More accurate modeling of real-world relationships

### Technical Enhancements

**CHANGE:** Validation - Added k-fold cross-validation
**RATIONALE:** Ensure model robustness and generalizability
**IMPACT:** More reliable predictions and model stability

**CHANGE:** Diagnostics - Added comprehensive testing suite
**RATIONALE:** Address multicollinearity and heteroskedasticity concerns
**IMPACT:** Improved model reliability and validity

### Policy Integration

**CHANGE:** Added Hong Kong-specific policy variables
**RATIONALE:** Better alignment with local context
**IMPACT:** Enhanced practical applicability

**CHANGE:** Enhanced equity metrics
**RATIONALE:** Address distributional concerns
**IMPACT:** Better policy alignment and stakeholder acceptance
