1
00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:06.729
Simon Wang: Alright, so for the first two weeks, we're going to record, our lecture on Zoom.

2
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:22.010
Simon Wang: And, you should be able to refer to the Zoom recording. And again, this is the second week of our course, GCAP 3226, and please come to the Zoom, including those who are watching this video, you can

3
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:30.400
Simon Wang: come to the… our, Moodle classroom, and, you should be able to, find the…

4
00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.670
Simon Wang: Week 1 video, and also transcripts.

5
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:51.120
Simon Wang: just to catch up, you know, I know some of you were not here last week, so if you want to catch up, you want to know more about this course, what we're trying to do, you can just, well, I mean, you probably don't want to watch the whole video, but there's actually transcripts available you can take a look as well.

6
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.200
Simon Wang: Now, please go to, week 2 notes.

7
00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.849
Simon Wang: So, as you can see, we've got in-class and after-class discussion, and then we have week two notes.

8
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:21.130
Simon Wang: So, just a little bit of recap. I think I have already talked about this, but, the basic course objectives are here. I don't want to necessarily repeat myself. You can refer to the, week one video, week one scripts, and also the bullet points here.

9
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.670
Simon Wang: And then we have got a, course hub and,

10
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:41.449
Simon Wang: You know, there's a course overview, there's a link to the Google Docs and everything. Again, it's for your reference. We can update here, but mainly, if you just want more direct access to the materials, you can come back to Moodle.

11
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.170
Simon Wang: We don't want to kind of overwhelm you with all the different, information, so we go back to the Moodle…

12
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.520
Simon Wang: notes.

13
00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.210
Simon Wang: I don't, I don't necessarily… yeah, okay, so, so maybe we can show the roadmap.

14
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:13.929
Simon Wang: Right, so we have a roadmap. Again, right now, we are in week two, and because it's during the shopping period, we're not going to ask you to form the groups or select the topics or anything yet, so we're just going to give you a taste

15
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:22.079
Simon Wang: of, what we're trying to do, because, the AI tool, using AI to write programming codes, that's kind of one of the highlights

16
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:38.730
Simon Wang: Of this course. And also, it can be a little bit overwhelming and scary, so it's like, we want to eat the frog first, so to speak. So today, it won't be, like, a full 3-hour session, you know, maybe for some of you from computer science major, it's just,

17
00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:57.779
Simon Wang: like, a breeze. It's, very, very, straightforward for you. But in that case, please do help, all the other, your fellow students, okay? So, help them a little bit, and help us. And then starting from, week three and four, we will start, looking at some of the case studies that we're going to

18
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:15.260
Simon Wang: focus on in this course, and we're also going to, form groups, and we will invite you to start, picking some projects and start working in this course. And we do hope that in each group, there will be, you know, students from different backgrounds, so we can work together.

19
00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:29.600
Simon Wang: All right? So, yeah, so the rest of the roadmap, you can just take a look, and this is actually the first time we run this course, so we are still kind of finalize things a bit, so there might be some changes

20
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:41.389
Simon Wang: over the course, so… but, in general, I think the rule of thumb is that we try to support you, especially when you are not from a math or computer science background.

21
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:53.750
Simon Wang: So, if you feel like there's a little bit difficult or challenging at this stage, do not worry too much, because we're here to help you, and we want to ensure that this course is

22
00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:01.070
Simon Wang: Friendly, to everybody, you know, not just for… for students from… from science background, okay?

23
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:19.970
Simon Wang: So, with that, let's move on. You can look at… there's also assessment information from last week, which we will not repeat, but you can check out. We are going to offer more information and instruction about the instruction… about the assessment in due course.

24
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:31.170
Simon Wang: Now, we're going to get into the actual hands-on parts of today's work, so, if you can, come to this Moodle

25
00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:43.059
Simon Wang: page, the notes, you should be able to download the week 2 materials. It's a zip file, so once you download it, you can unzip it, you should be able to get a folder.

26
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.439
Simon Wang: And as you can… once you download it, please go ahead and download it.

27
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:58.670
Simon Wang: For those of you who are getting a tablet computer, like an iPad, I'm not sure whether… is this going to work on…

28
00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.850
Simon Wang: Hi, Pat.

29
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:20.959
Simon Wang: Yeah, so, I think for those of you who are using a tablet computer, I would encourage you to get a mobile computer next week, but, for now, I mean, you can still just kind of tag along and look at what we're doing, and maybe go to some…

30
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:33.079
Simon Wang: Go to one of the students with a mobile computer, so you know how things will work, and then you can go home, and with your mobile computer, or go to a computer lab, you should be able to get things done fairly quickly.

31
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:43.779
Simon Wang: So again, going back to the ZIP package, there will be a CSV file, so this is the data, okay? So,

32
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.699
Simon Wang: CSV is very similar to spreadsheet, but it's simpler, okay?

33
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:55.780
Simon Wang: So you can think of it as a spreadsheet. When you open it, it will be a spreadsheet, okay?

34
00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.390
Simon Wang: And then there will be another fire, it's the Jupyter Notebook.

35
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:12.320
Simon Wang: Now, Jupyter Notebook, you would consider this as some codes, okay? And, this is a file that you can write some codes, and the codes can be run.

36
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.130
Simon Wang: right there, okay? So, there will be,

37
00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.249
Simon Wang: You know, of course, behind the scenes, there will be some other program running.

38
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.540
Simon Wang: And then there will be… yeah, I think that's mainly the two files.

39
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:37.560
Simon Wang: And in order to run the Jupyter Notebook, you can't just open the Jupyter Notebook, like, on your Word or Notepad or anything, so you have to install a software

40
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:43.180
Simon Wang: It's called, VS Code. But, there will be more instruction that the Talia will provide you.

41
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.649
Simon Wang: So, do you want to go down a bit?

42
00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:51.210
Simon Wang: So again, what we're trying to do today is to introduce some analytical tools

43
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:59.580
Simon Wang: including GitHub, Copiler that can help you write the codes, alright? Because, you know.

44
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:16.149
Simon Wang: I don't think we can run this course without AI, basically. If we talk about, like, two years ago, like, even one year ago, AI is not really that good at programming or writing program calls. We can't really run this course, you know, or we can only run this course for students who have already done some programming.

45
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:31.600
Simon Wang: But now with AI, we can basically teach this course even to students who have zero programming background, okay? So, yeah, so I think that's kind of the introduction. Maybe, Tayle, do you want to start getting into the details?

46
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.929
Simon Wang: Okay, so good morning, everyone.

47
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:54.110
Simon Wang: In the zip file you downloaded, actually there is a PDF file, which contains, some of the content shows here in this, like, interactive

48
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.300
Simon Wang: Panel.

49
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:10.570
Simon Wang: So this is the slides that I made for this relative technical part of today's course. So it's called Data Visualization with GitHub Copilot.

50
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.440
Simon Wang: I will skip this recap.

51
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:24.329
Simon Wang: And only mention that this will be part of the analytical tools for our data-informed policymaking in Hong Kong.

52
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:39.029
Simon Wang: So in today's task, we will focus on data visualization, and first of all, I would like to give you a context of the problem, or the data that we will visualize.

53
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:47.820
Simon Wang: So, I do not want to, do the data visualization for visualization, so hopefully this will be a,

54
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.409
Simon Wang: Comprehensive context for the visualization task.

55
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:56.279
Simon Wang: So if you click the link, here on this PDF.

56
00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:01.890
Simon Wang: It will lead you to this… questionnaire.

57
00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:09.109
Simon Wang: About this, people's… this is the, survey.

58
00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.369
Simon Wang: for the, Hong Kong, Manipet.

59
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:16.590
Simon Wang: Municipal solid waste charging policies of it.

60
00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:25.009
Simon Wang: So I think most of you have heard about this policy, right? So last year, finally, it is postponed again, so it is not implemented.

61
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:29.750
Simon Wang: And actually, there is a very long story for this policy.

62
00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:34.629
Simon Wang: Because at the very beginning, it can date back to 2005.

63
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.420
Simon Wang: I think it's when… about the time that you were born… you were born.

64
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:44.360
Simon Wang: See, around 20 years ago, Hong Kong government.

65
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.520
Simon Wang: Published this policy framework for municipal solid waste management.

66
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:56.289
Simon Wang: So even 20 years ago, this policy framework was already published.

67
00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:02.680
Simon Wang: But after 20 years, this policy is still not implemented, due to many,

68
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:07.209
Simon Wang: Practical issues, and also very, also many controversials.

69
00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:17.950
Simon Wang: So here, this study focused on some potential influencing factors of this, of the level of support for this policy.

70
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.659
Simon Wang: So here shows the description.

71
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:30.190
Simon Wang: The aim of this survey is to understand Hong Kong residents' awareness attitudes.

72
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:35.800
Simon Wang: And daily waste management behaviors related to this waste charging policy.

73
00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.609
Simon Wang: So that's the overall aim of the survey.

74
00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:52.550
Simon Wang: And later, we will look at the data that's collected based on this survey, and do the data visualization for specific questions.

75
00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:58.109
Simon Wang: So this questionnaire is divided into four sections.

76
00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:01.909
Simon Wang: First, the assessment of the policy support.

77
00:11:02.830 --> 00:11:06.689
Simon Wang: So this is, like, the, our response variable.

78
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:15.180
Simon Wang: Because we want to explore the potential influencing factors of the level of support to this policy.

79
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:31.399
Simon Wang: So we want to know what kind of factors will, affect, for example, the following exploratory variables, like the household waste disposal and recycling habits.

80
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:40.409
Simon Wang: Say, whether the, household who, which deposed a lot of garbages will tend to,

81
00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:44.390
Simon Wang: To be more against this policy.

82
00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:48.759
Simon Wang: Because overall, the policy says that the more waste

83
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:53.930
Simon Wang: The household produce, or the, say, the restaurant owners produce.

84
00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.400
Simon Wang: The higher amount of money they should pay.

85
00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:59.969
Simon Wang: The polluter pay principle.

86
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:09.250
Simon Wang: So maybe, the level of support to this policy may have certain relationship with the amount of waste disposal.

87
00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:16.600
Simon Wang: Or… The recycling habits may also affect the level of support.

88
00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:22.400
Simon Wang: Say, for those who have already, get used to recycled waste.

89
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:30.629
Simon Wang: They may have a higher recycling frequency, or they pay more effort on recycling items.

90
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:37.989
Simon Wang: Then if that is the case, it is likely that the level of support for this policy will be higher.

91
00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:44.449
Simon Wang: So these are the, potential influencing factors,

92
00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.490
Simon Wang: Of this level of support for this policy.

93
00:12:49.690 --> 00:13:00.409
Simon Wang: Similarly, the demographic information, for example, maybe the level of education will also affect their level of support.

94
00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:02.379
Simon Wang: or the age.

95
00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:16.570
Simon Wang: They, with, more senior people may tend to, more against this policy, so these are all potential factors that will influence the level of

96
00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.450
Simon Wang: The policy support.

97
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:25.990
Simon Wang: So then, let's dive into, how these questions are set in this questionnaire.

98
00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:33.360
Simon Wang: So the first section is this assessment of policy support.

99
00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.270
Simon Wang: So before asking the, questions.

100
00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:43.999
Simon Wang: Firstly, here shows a very brief introduction to this municipal solid waste charging policy.

101
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.549
Simon Wang: So it's based on this polluter pace principle.

102
00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:56.149
Simon Wang: And requiring all household and non-household pharmacists in Hong Kong to pay according to the quality of waste disposed.

103
00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:02.480
Simon Wang: So the more waste disposed, the higher the cost of purchasing designated bags or tags.

104
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.529
Simon Wang: So that's the principle.

105
00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:11.909
Simon Wang: And the purpose is to reduce the amount of waste and promote the recycling behavior.

106
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.370
Simon Wang: And here also shows some basic information.

107
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:21.909
Simon Wang: Like, according to the Environmental Protection Department's estimate.

108
00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.179
Simon Wang: 3 to 4 person households using one

109
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:31.740
Simon Wang: 10L, or 15L designated garbage bag per day.

110
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:37.920
Simon Wang: Would incur a monthly waste charging fee of approximately $30 to $53.

111
00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:44.079
Simon Wang: So that's the basic background information of what this policy is.

112
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.610
Simon Wang: So then we can go to the questions.

113
00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:56.139
Simon Wang: So, first of all, this is the key, measurement, we focus.

114
00:14:56.670 --> 00:15:00.739
Simon Wang: To how much extent the respondents support this policy?

115
00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:23.850
Simon Wang: And starting from the second question to the fifth question, it's actually the, preserved, like, fairness or preserved responsiveness to public opinion from different, measuring the attitude of the respondents from different, aspects.

116
00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:30.590
Simon Wang: For example, for this second question, according to the polluter-pays Principle.

117
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.160
Simon Wang: Do you think charging by the amount of garbage can fairly

118
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.470
Simon Wang: Reflect the environmental burden of different families.

119
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:45.900
Simon Wang: So this question measure the perceived fairness of this policy.

120
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:53.249
Simon Wang: And I think it's reasonable to assume that if people tend to believe that this policy is fair.

121
00:15:53.430 --> 00:16:00.300
Simon Wang: Then, it's likely that They will support, they will, like, more support this policy.

122
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:04.110
Simon Wang: So this is one possible influencing factor.

123
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:14.010
Simon Wang: Another perspective is, Do you think the government has fully considered the opinions

124
00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.480
Simon Wang: Of citizens from different social classes.

125
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.520
Simon Wang: When formulating this garbage charging policy.

126
00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.449
Simon Wang: So this is another aspect.

127
00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:30.449
Simon Wang: It's the responsiveness to the public opinion when making this policy.

128
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:31.860
Simon Wang: So…

129
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:45.929
Simon Wang: I think, again, it's very likely that if the respondents believe that the government has fully considered the opinions of citizens, then it's likely that they will support this policy.

130
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.730
Simon Wang: And another possible perspective is.

131
00:16:53.920 --> 00:17:00.709
Simon Wang: How helpful do you think the waste charging policy will be in reducing the total waste volume?

132
00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:09.470
Simon Wang: So this question measures the helpfulness, or perceived helpfulness, of this policy.

133
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:14.030
Simon Wang: to… To reduce the total waste volume.

134
00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:21.629
Simon Wang: So, if the, respondents believe that this policy is helpful.

135
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:27.419
Simon Wang: To reduce the waste, then it is likely that there will support for this policy.

136
00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:38.530
Simon Wang: And the last question in this section is, how severe do you think Hong Kong's current waste management issues are?

137
00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:47.369
Simon Wang: So this measures the perceived severity of the waste management situation in Hong Kong.

138
00:17:48.200 --> 00:18:00.030
Simon Wang: So, supposedly, if the respondents feel that the waste management issue in Hong Kong is already severe enough, then it's likely that they will support this policy.

139
00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:07.010
Simon Wang: Sorry to interrupt, I don't know.

140
00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:12.860
Simon Wang: Because we have a couple of students just join us. Just want to make sure that we're on the same page.

141
00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.919
Simon Wang: If you can go to our Week 2 notes in Moodle.

142
00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:21.190
Simon Wang: And then, I actually replied.

143
00:18:23.530 --> 00:18:28.399
Simon Wang: To share a, maybe I have to refresh.

144
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:29.739
Simon Wang: Just refresh.

145
00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:41.849
Simon Wang: So, there's actually a link to the Google Form, right? So, so you should be able to access, you only take a quick look. The idea is that,

146
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:58.670
Simon Wang: as we explained earlier, today we're going to teach you how to use some… writing some Python codes to analyze the data, right? But for illustration purpose, we need to have some data to write the code, and the codes can…

147
00:18:58.670 --> 00:19:05.759
Simon Wang: Perform, you know, can take the data as input, and then there will be output, which would become the charts and graphs and everything.

148
00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:20.209
Simon Wang: All right, so now what Dr. Wu is doing is to explain the context, right? So we know what the data looks like. If you want to look at the data, you can just go to that download zip file… the zip file, go to that folder, you will find a CSV.

149
00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:27.450
Simon Wang: Okay? So the CSV file is the… the data, is the responses to that questionnaire.

150
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:36.820
Simon Wang: Okay? The whole journey would be, you want to do some project, you want to do some research, you want to gauge the people's opinions, so you run a questionnaire.

151
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:55.989
Simon Wang: All right, so when people fill in the questionnaire, they will become, like, a CSV file. There's data, you know, quantitative data. And you can't just make sense of data, right? It's all just numbers, you know, rows and cells. So we have to write a program that can do the kind of tedious work.

152
00:19:55.990 --> 00:20:06.629
Simon Wang: to turn the data into something that makes more sense to humans, which is graphs and charts and everything. So that's what we're trying to do today, okay? I hope that makes sense.

153
00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:22.420
Simon Wang: And again, if you are on a tablet computer, like an iPad, you can just probably listen a little bit, get to know what's going on, and when you go home, you can run the code very quickly on your own computer, right? Thanks.

154
00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:24.300
Simon Wang: Okay.

155
00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:34.530
Simon Wang: So later in the CSV file, you will see the, support info.

156
00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:43.939
Simon Wang: So that question refers to this first question, and you will see that 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, which represents for different options.

157
00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:51.340
Simon Wang: Because this type of questions is, has an ordinal sense, so it…

158
00:20:51.660 --> 00:21:05.820
Simon Wang: starts from the strongly opposed to strongly support. So this contains the order in these options, so it is reasonable to use 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 to code these options.

159
00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:18.579
Simon Wang: That's the reason later in the CSV file, you did not… you will not see the… the exact wordings, like, strongly oppose, oppose. Instead, you will see numbers, like, from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

160
00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:19.590
Simon Wang: Okay.

161
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:27.909
Simon Wang: And… So for this study, you can actually observe that it measures

162
00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:35.780
Simon Wang: Or it explores the potential influencing factors of the level of support from a conceptual perspective.

163
00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:44.680
Simon Wang: So, people preserve the fairness, or perceived the responsiveness to the public opinion.

164
00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.459
Simon Wang: These are all from the conceptual perspective.

165
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:52.390
Simon Wang: Rather than a practical perspective.

166
00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:59.890
Simon Wang: So during the discussion for this, whether we should really implement this policy.

167
00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:04.319
Simon Wang: There are actually many, practical controversials.

168
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:23.380
Simon Wang: Like, I think one of the most commonly seen discussion or mentioned difficulty of implementing this policy is about the number of recycling facilities in community is not enough.

169
00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:30.960
Simon Wang: Right? Because… If the recycling facility are not enough, then…

170
00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:37.650
Simon Wang: Even if people want to reduce the waste, want to do recycle, then there's no enough support.

171
00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:48.259
Simon Wang: I'm not sure whether you have observed this, you want to recycle some items, and you bring them to the recycle bin, but it turns out that the recycle bin is already full.

172
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:55.950
Simon Wang: So these may imply that the overall, either the amount of the recycling facilities is not enough.

173
00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:03.349
Simon Wang: Or, the manpower to, timely empty those bins is not enough.

174
00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:07.769
Simon Wang: But then the question is, do we have such data?

175
00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.190
Simon Wang: Do we have such data to measure?

176
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:16.940
Simon Wang: The existing utility rate for the recycling facilities.

177
00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:28.649
Simon Wang: So suppose if we have such data, say we found that only 30% of the existing recycling bins

178
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:32.250
Simon Wang: are used. The utility rate is really low.

179
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:38.589
Simon Wang: Then this would not be a controversial anymore, because Data shows us that.

180
00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:40.809
Simon Wang: There's enough facility.

181
00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:49.090
Simon Wang: Then the focus of the government should be to promote or to encourage people to do the recycling.

182
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:50.000
Simon Wang: Right.

183
00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:54.239
Simon Wang: Then this is… the… the facility itself is not an issue.

184
00:23:55.120 --> 00:24:01.239
Simon Wang: But if it turns out that data shows that 90% of the facility is used.

185
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.740
Simon Wang: Or even sometimes is overused.

186
00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:16.739
Simon Wang: Then the resources need to be put in either to increase the amount of recycling facilities, or to the manpower to timely empty those existing recycling bins.

187
00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:31.380
Simon Wang: So this, decision will be, will be based on the data, and whether we have such data, whether the government has collected such data, whether we can access such kind of data.

188
00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:42.939
Simon Wang: So these might be the problems that we… we can try to, inquire those officers, or try to… try to find on the internet, try to… try to search for.

189
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:48.500
Simon Wang: And even when we step back, thinking of

190
00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:54.280
Simon Wang: At the planning stage of putting those recycling facilities in the community.

191
00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:58.890
Simon Wang: How exactly did the government make the decision?

192
00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:04.420
Simon Wang: Say we have 18 districts in Hong Kong.

193
00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:10.600
Simon Wang: With different number of population, with different demographic features.

194
00:25:11.050 --> 00:25:15.309
Simon Wang: And when those recycling facilities were put

195
00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.649
Simon Wang: Or were planned to put in different districts.

196
00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:22.819
Simon Wang: What kind of information is used to make such decision?

197
00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:26.490
Simon Wang: Do they consider the population?

198
00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:32.140
Simon Wang: Do they consider the average age of the resident in that area?

199
00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.709
Simon Wang: Or do they even consider the education level?

200
00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:45.440
Simon Wang: What kind of factors do they consider when they make the decision to put certain amount of facilities in those communities?

201
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.980
Simon Wang: So that will be… that will be, another question that, I think you can think of.

202
00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:59.649
Simon Wang: And if we go one step further, To what extent?

203
00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:03.070
Simon Wang: The recycling for citizens is enough.

204
00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:15.059
Simon Wang: So how can the government set the evaluation mechanisms to dynamically evaluate the usage of these facilities?

205
00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:20.200
Simon Wang: I think this is also a question that we can't think of.

206
00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:27.670
Simon Wang: When we… when we consider about the level of support for the policy from the practical perspective.

207
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:38.110
Simon Wang: So for this specific questionnaire, it focused on the influencing factors of level of support, From the conceptual level.

208
00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:47.040
Simon Wang: And maybe later in your group project, you may consider this problem from a more practical perspective.

209
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.110
Simon Wang: Okay, so this is the first section.

210
00:26:53.890 --> 00:27:00.379
Simon Wang: And for the second section, it's about the household waste disposal and recycling habits.

211
00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:05.260
Simon Wang: So the number of bags, The household dispose of daily.

212
00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:09.500
Simon Wang: And the frequency of the recycling behavior.

213
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:15.729
Simon Wang: The time and effort that is typically taken to recycle the items.

214
00:27:17.210 --> 00:27:21.519
Simon Wang: And the last question is whether you have seen this food waste recycling bins.

215
00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:33.669
Simon Wang: So, as mentioned, these are all potential influencing factors of the level of support.

216
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.089
Simon Wang: Oh, except for this fourth question. This is just a…

217
00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:41.809
Simon Wang: Like a, collecting information about the,

218
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:46.809
Simon Wang: The scene frequency of this waste… food waste recycle bin.

219
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:53.810
Simon Wang: And if the respondents had seen this food waste recycling bin before.

220
00:27:53.960 --> 00:28:01.020
Simon Wang: Then, the next question will be asked is, have you ever used the food waste recycling bins?

221
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:09.339
Simon Wang: Okay, the third part is about the, some, some knowledge of the recycling.

222
00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:14.249
Simon Wang: I think the assumption behind these three questions is

223
00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:19.920
Simon Wang: If the person really cares about the environment, or…

224
00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:31.820
Simon Wang: He has much knowledge about the recycling, then possibly they will have a higher support level for the waste charging policy.

225
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:44.750
Simon Wang: I will quickly fill some… options here. So these are, overall, this section tests the knowledge.

226
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:53.030
Simon Wang: And… The fourth section is actually a re-evaluation of the policy support.

227
00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:58.069
Simon Wang: So here, the designer of this questionnaire

228
00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:02.519
Simon Wang: Shows two pieces of information regarding this policy.

229
00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.299
Simon Wang: And see whether this information will affect

230
00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:09.110
Simon Wang: The level of support for the respondents.

231
00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:16.630
Simon Wang: So the four… first key information is that, actually, Hong Kong's landfills are nearing capacity.

232
00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:26.450
Simon Wang: So it says, based on the current daily waste intake, both landfills are projected to reach full capacity by next year.

233
00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:30.479
Simon Wang: So this works like a warning.

234
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:37.739
Simon Wang: Like, the severity of Hong Kong's waste management is actually quite high. It's very severe now.

235
00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.750
Simon Wang: We're facing this situation.

236
00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:48.480
Simon Wang: And the second piece of information shows a successful case of a nearby country, the South Korean.

237
00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:53.679
Simon Wang: Which implemented this waste charging policy in 1995,

238
00:29:54.150 --> 00:29:59.270
Simon Wang: And it turns out that after, over… 30 years.

239
00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:04.359
Simon Wang: The, recycling rate has reached 60%.

240
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:14.759
Simon Wang: So the designer would like to test whether receiving these two pieces of information Made to some extent.

241
00:30:15.030 --> 00:30:16.020
Simon Wang: change.

242
00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.499
Simon Wang: The level of support of the respondents.

243
00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:26.569
Simon Wang: So, if it turns out that this kind of, information might be helpful to improve.

244
00:30:26.730 --> 00:30:34.309
Simon Wang: The level of support, then maybe later in promotion of such policy, we may use the same strategy.

245
00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:54.190
Simon Wang: So later, you will, really, visualize the data, so before the showing up of these two pieces of information, naturally, what is, on average, the, support rate.

246
00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.430
Simon Wang: For this policy.

247
00:30:56.990 --> 00:31:04.160
Simon Wang: And then there's another, variable, which captures the level of supportness after.

248
00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:07.089
Simon Wang: The respondents received this information.

249
00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:12.809
Simon Wang: And hopefully you… you will be curious about whether there's any change.

250
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:16.639
Simon Wang: Of the support nets after showing this information.

251
00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:23.199
Simon Wang: And the last section is the demographic information.

252
00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:27.000
Simon Wang: These are quite,

253
00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:34.690
Simon Wang: commonly seen? Are you a permanent resident? What is the highest education level? Household size?

254
00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.749
Simon Wang: Which districts you leave.

255
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:46.650
Simon Wang: What's the type of housing do you leave, and age, interval, and also the household monthly income range, something like that.

256
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:51.290
Simon Wang: So again, these are all potential influencing factors.

257
00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:56.430
Simon Wang: To the level of support for this, garbage charging policy.

258
00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:01.649
Simon Wang: So this is the overall structure of this questionnaire.

259
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:05.500
Simon Wang: And as mentioned, today, the focus is to do visualization.

260
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:12.650
Simon Wang: To really test the association between this potential influencing factors.

261
00:32:12.770 --> 00:32:27.089
Simon Wang: to the response, we will put this… we have to use certain model, as mentioned, the regression model, to capture their relationships. But that will be the focus of our case study.

262
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:32.709
Simon Wang: For today, we will use the questions in this questionnaire to do the data visualization.

263
00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:44.710
Simon Wang: So later, I think… I'm not sure how many of you have installed VS Code.

264
00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.670
Simon Wang: Do you mind raising your hand?

265
00:32:48.600 --> 00:33:00.709
Simon Wang: Not many. I think during the break, you can still do it. Just follow the reference book, which I screenshot yesterday, sent you by email.

266
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:10.480
Simon Wang: So, from there, we can, download the… this is the code editor, which is called VS Code, that we will use to write, write Python code.

267
00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.269
Simon Wang: So here shows the interface of this VS Code.

268
00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:27.310
Simon Wang: because there are, I would say, many panels in this interface, so I think it's still useful to briefly talk about the structures.

269
00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:32.470
Simon Wang: Overall, on the left-hand side, here is the activity bar.

270
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:39.680
Simon Wang: The most, commonly used one should be this, so you see these blocks?

271
00:33:40.630 --> 00:33:48.740
Simon Wang: So this shows the extensions you need to install to open the Jupyter Notebook file we provided.

272
00:33:49.620 --> 00:33:53.749
Simon Wang: And… Next to it is a sidebar.

273
00:33:54.370 --> 00:34:02.649
Simon Wang: Which shows the folder you opened, and the scripts, or the notebook files in the directory.

274
00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:09.640
Simon Wang: And for these editor panels, we basically type our code.

275
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:14.659
Simon Wang: Here, so this is the, editing, panel.

276
00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:26.129
Simon Wang: And if we want to run the code, actually for Jupyter Notebook, this run button is not here, but just next to the code, on the left-hand side.

277
00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:30.729
Simon Wang: So after you install it, you will see that small button.

278
00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:38.120
Simon Wang: And for the bottom panel, it's called the output and terminal panel.

279
00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:43.069
Simon Wang: And I think at the very beginning stage, we don't even have to open this panel.

280
00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:52.940
Simon Wang: And here contains a co-pilot symbol. So if it looks like this, it means that your AI programming assistant is there for you.

281
00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.899
Simon Wang: So as long as you, install the,

282
00:34:58.030 --> 00:35:05.490
Simon Wang: AI co- sorry, the GitHub Copilot extension, you will be able to see this… this icon.

283
00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.080
Simon Wang: So this is the VS Code interface.

284
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:18.340
Simon Wang: And what we will use, To write code, it's called the Egyptian Notebook.

285
00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:25.100
Simon Wang: So this notebook is an interactive tool that lets you write and run codes

286
00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:29.689
Simon Wang: View results immediately, and also add notes.

287
00:35:31.370 --> 00:35:38.970
Simon Wang: So here shows the interface of a web version of Jupyter Notebook, so we will use a local version.

288
00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:42.029
Simon Wang: But here shows the, a web version.

289
00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:46.030
Simon Wang: Basically, there are, two types of cells.

290
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.360
Simon Wang: So as a cell, I mean, cell.

291
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:52.439
Simon Wang: So for this type of cell, it's, cold cell.

292
00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.049
Simon Wang: Where we input our code.

293
00:35:55.570 --> 00:36:01.819
Simon Wang: And there are also a type of, cell called markdown, where we can add the notes.

294
00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:07.180
Simon Wang: the reason we choose to use Jupyter Notebook is that

295
00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:17.579
Simon Wang: The, results of the code can be immediately shown up just right, after the code, so it's quite, friendly.

296
00:36:18.130 --> 00:36:23.649
Simon Wang: Say I have many code for my visualization, and after I run it.

297
00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:28.769
Simon Wang: Then the corresponding figures will… will be… show up immediately.

298
00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:33.090
Simon Wang: op… Below this, code cell.

299
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:47.520
Simon Wang: And here shows the, specific, instruction, but I think this part is, needed after you install the, the VS Code, Python.

300
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:52.099
Simon Wang: So maybe I skip this for, At this moment.

301
00:36:53.610 --> 00:37:01.550
Simon Wang: And I think maybe later we have the break first, and during this break, as mentioned, you could,

302
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:10.560
Simon Wang: go ahead to download Python VS Code, and also install the relevant extension from here.

303
00:37:10.850 --> 00:37:13.619
Simon Wang: And then we will go to this, this scene.

304
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:18.429
Simon Wang: So, I think after the break, I will continue from… from here.

305
00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:28.760
Simon Wang: Alright, so let's take a short break, and if you have any questions about the setup, you can reply to our Week 2 notes.

306
00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:38.299
Simon Wang: And I will be monitoring, you know, any reply, but of course, you know, you can raise your hand. I mean, for people who are watching the video, or, you know, you need any help.

307
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:45.609
Simon Wang: And starting from next week, once we, after the Agile period, I'm going to set up a WhatsApp group.

308
00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:50.650
Simon Wang: So you guys can join the group, and we can have further discussion, alright?

309
00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:58.770
Simon Wang: Right, so there's a little bit of technical details here, so I hope you can be patient if this is new to you.

310
00:37:58.950 --> 00:38:06.950
Simon Wang: I think, all this, software and interface has been designed to be human-friendly.

311
00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:25.350
Simon Wang: Alright, so there's actually a lot of codes and a lot of magic running behind the scenes. So when we write a program with AI assistance, there's different levels of abstraction that we can decide, you know. At the highest level, you can treat all this as black box.

312
00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:29.670
Simon Wang: In other words, all you care about is the input and output.

313
00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:34.379
Simon Wang: What happened in between? You don't really have to… have to worry much about.

314
00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:53.899
Simon Wang: And I think that's probably good enough for students taking this course, especially those with no programming background. You just follow the instruction, and you need to do a bit copy and pasting, you send the instruction to AI, the AI will generate codes, you copy and paste back to the Jupyter Notebook VS Code, and it will run.

315
00:38:54.170 --> 00:39:03.949
Simon Wang: Alright, if it doesn't run, there may be some errors, there's some warning, you copy those errors and warning to AI again, and AI will tell you what to do, and you do it.

316
00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:10.660
Simon Wang: Okay, and why do you want to do that? And how the codes actually work? You don't have to worry about that at this stage.

317
00:39:10.790 --> 00:39:28.089
Simon Wang: I mean, at some point, if you feel like you want to learn more, you want to become a more advanced learner of programming, then you can look into the codes. You can figure out, oh, actually, this code is calling this function, that code is taking some data from somewhere, and, you know, there's all the details you can learn.

318
00:39:28.090 --> 00:39:31.510
Simon Wang: But at this stage, for our purpose, for our cause.

319
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:43.070
Simon Wang: you don't have to worry about all those technical details. So I hope that can give you kind of a peace of mind, you know, in terms of if you are from a non-programming background.

320
00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:56.159
Simon Wang: But at the same time, I also hope this experience would give you the opportunity to actually open the door for you, right? So maybe later on in your work, in your life, there's some other problems that need programming to help.

321
00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:15.039
Simon Wang: then it can help, you see what I mean? So the next time when people talk to you about VS Code, Python, or Jupyter Notebook, it's not just all, like, a foreign language or Greek to you, you see what I mean? So I think that's really important. So I think, you know, I don't want to preach, but I think it's really important to

322
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.609
Simon Wang: Get out of our comfort zone and try new things, right?

323
00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:24.390
Simon Wang: Let's take a short break, and we'll come back to do the hands-on thing.

324
00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:12.159
Simon Wang: Let's check the progress. Raise your hand if you already got your VS Code installed on your computer. That seems to be a very important step. Raise your hand.

325
00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:13.450
Simon Wang: Okay?

326
00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:18.770
Simon Wang: Now, raise your hand if you got that zip file downloaded from Moodle.

327
00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:23.640
Simon Wang: and, open it on unzipit, Yeah?

328
00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:32.439
Simon Wang: Okay? Now, what you need to do, if you haven't done, is to go to VS Code and open that folder.

329
00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:36.149
Simon Wang: Where you, you unzip the zip file from.

330
00:48:36.370 --> 00:48:44.909
Simon Wang: Okay? Because once you download the zip file, it must be somewhere, right? It could be on your desktop, it could be one of the folders.

331
00:48:45.090 --> 00:48:57.119
Simon Wang: for the… for the course, you probably have a folder for this course. So, you unzip that file into your course folder, so there will be a folder for this specific, activity.

332
00:48:57.300 --> 00:49:03.230
Simon Wang: And in that folder, you should find a, one CSV, one file.

333
00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:09.229
Simon Wang: end with CSV, that's the data file. Another file that ends with IP… IP…

334
00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:12.719
Simon Wang: Why something? Which is a Jupyter Notebook.

335
00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:19.839
Simon Wang: And then there's another, I think it's a PDF or something. So basically, you… you have to use VS Code to open

336
00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.760
Simon Wang: That folder.

337
00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:30.029
Simon Wang: And, on the left-hand side, you will see a panel where you can see the folder, alright?

338
00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.120
Simon Wang: And, and also the files.

339
00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:40.290
Simon Wang: Now, once you are at that stage, you are in business, okay? So you can open the Jupyter Notebook file.

340
00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:42.399
Simon Wang: In the VS Code.

341
00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:45.160
Simon Wang: So you can start doing the coding.

342
00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:56.040
Simon Wang: Alright? Now, I mean, if you are a good programmer, you're an experienced programmer, you can even just write the code by yourself. You don't need AI. But for beginners.

343
00:49:56.210 --> 00:50:01.199
Simon Wang: then you can get some help from AI. So how do you get help from AI? Well.

344
00:50:01.330 --> 00:50:05.549
Simon Wang: you can actually go to Poe, you can go to Grok, go to DeepSeek.

345
00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:19.869
Simon Wang: you can do that as well. But the Copilot is more integrated, right? So that's why you want to start using Copilot. Now, in VS Code, you need to install an extension called GitHub Copilot.

346
00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:32.440
Simon Wang: So you can access Copilot. That's your friend, okay? It can help you solve all the problems related to programming for this course, so make sure that you install the extension GitHub Copilot.

347
00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:40.529
Simon Wang: We do need to register, right? Sign up for a GitHub account, do we? Okay, so once you,

348
00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:45.049
Simon Wang: Once you have your extension of the GitHub compiler ready.

349
00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:54.579
Simon Wang: when you try to fire it up and start using Copilot, then Copilot would ask you to log in to GitHub, right, because it's a GitHub service.

350
00:50:54.800 --> 00:51:01.729
Simon Wang: So then, this is a very important moment now, okay? Once you join the GitHub, you join a community of programmers.

351
00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:11.370
Simon Wang: Alright? So, and, next time when you talk to people, you say, I have a GitHub account, alright? That's something you should be proud of.

352
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:21.790
Simon Wang: And you can start making friends on GitHub. There's so many very interesting open source, projects and things that's going on in GitHub.

353
00:51:21.890 --> 00:51:33.489
Simon Wang: Right? So maybe you are running into some really interesting project, and you can… you can, right, do a… a build-up, do a follow-up on that project, you see. GitHub is a… is an amazing community, okay?

354
00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:37.640
Simon Wang: And now, once, once you're on GitHub.

355
00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:41.510
Simon Wang: Once you have the account, you should have access to Copilot.

356
00:51:41.670 --> 00:52:01.490
Simon Wang: All right? And at some point, you may want to, apply for the GitHub education. Because you are a university student, you are entitled to the education benefits of GitHub, so you can do that later. Because for this particular project, the free account should give you all the resources, all the tokens, and everything you need.

357
00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:12.280
Simon Wang: Okay, so you don't have to worry. So I think we have kind of just explained to you how you can reach the stage, you have a co-pilot next to you to start writing codes.

358
00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:17.009
Simon Wang: If you have… need some help to get to that step.

359
00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:28.699
Simon Wang: just let us know, okay? So, we want to make sure that everybody is on the same page, everybody can have access to compiler. You know, you need to install VS Code, open the folder.

360
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:36.209
Simon Wang: install the GitHub Copilot extension, apply… join the GitHub, get a GitHub account.

361
00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:40.220
Simon Wang: Login, and you're… then we're in business, okay?

362
00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:50.610
Simon Wang: It's better to have, maybe I'll share my screen, too, so I can…

363
00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:56.889
Simon Wang: Wait, that's selfish.

364
00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.410
Simon Wang: Oh, no.

365
00:53:06.910 --> 00:53:07.663
Simon Wang: Oh, the

366
00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:40.669
Simon Wang: But we also need to watch it.

367
00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:51.850
Simon Wang: Oh, gosh.

368
00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:26.530
Simon Wang: So, for those of you who,

369
00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:30.210
Simon Wang: Need some help, you can look at the screen here.

370
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:33.039
Simon Wang: So, of course, I'm using Mac.

371
00:56:33.230 --> 00:56:36.940
Simon Wang: If you are using a window space, it's a little bit different.

372
00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:43.140
Simon Wang: So basically, what, what you can do is… go to…

373
00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:47.209
Simon Wang: code, right? Go to VS Code.

374
00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:50.570
Simon Wang: And, VS Code is actually just called Code.

375
00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:58.460
Simon Wang: Let me see if I can make it a bit bigger.

376
00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:10.570
Simon Wang: Alright, so, you are in… you are in VS Code, you will be able to see codes here. You just open the folder, right? So you open the folder.

377
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:14.049
Simon Wang: And it is the folder where you have unzipped.

378
00:57:14.460 --> 00:57:22.449
Simon Wang: the zip file we provided is called Week 2 Data Visualization GitHub Compiler. Now, you open it.

379
00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:33.399
Simon Wang: And once you open it, You can see there's, 3 files, One is the CSV,

380
00:57:34.410 --> 00:57:40.499
Simon Wang: The week 2 CSV, that's the… that's the spreadsheet, okay? That's all the… all the data we got from the questionnaire.

381
00:57:41.070 --> 00:57:50.150
Simon Wang: And there's also the PDF, So the PDF is the slides that, Dr. Wu just, presented?

382
00:57:51.590 --> 00:57:59.559
Simon Wang: And then there's the IPYMB, the extension. So this is the… Jupy the notebook.

383
00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:03.730
Simon Wang: Where you want to, work on.

384
00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:06.650
Simon Wang: So, I hope you are here.

385
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:13.080
Simon Wang: Now, once you are here, Then you want to, open up

386
00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:20.140
Simon Wang: The sidebar, so there's a side window here, that's the, Co-pilot.

387
00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:22.319
Simon Wang: That's the GitHub copiler.

388
00:58:22.620 --> 00:58:24.200
Simon Wang: Now, in order to…

389
00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:33.459
Simon Wang: fire up this GitHub compiler thing, you will have to install the extension. So where do you install an extension? You come here.

390
00:58:34.550 --> 00:58:35.529
Simon Wang: Oh, sorry.

391
00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:40.900
Simon Wang: Right, so, so, so you come here, you see there's,

392
00:58:41.890 --> 00:58:48.029
Simon Wang: 3 square, and one, also square, but, move… rotate a little bit.

393
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:55.780
Simon Wang: So that's the extension, right? So it's like, extension is like a piece of puzzle added to your… to your picture, right?

394
00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:58.250
Simon Wang: So, there's many extensions.

395
00:58:58.430 --> 00:59:05.150
Simon Wang: And you need to find an extension which is… the, GitHub Copilot, okay?

396
00:59:06.580 --> 00:59:15.020
Simon Wang: And once you install it, you can open up here, and you can start Get some help from…

397
00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:16.660
Simon Wang: from Copilot.

398
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:23.640
Simon Wang: Now, in Copilot, there are 3 options. There's Agent, there's Ask, there's Edit.

399
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:26.289
Simon Wang: The agent mode is more advanced.

400
00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:29.729
Simon Wang: It's a very recent, feature.

401
00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:33.159
Simon Wang: So, I would encourage you to go for Ask.

402
00:59:33.450 --> 00:59:42.440
Simon Wang: Because Agent Mode can be a bit confusing for beginners, so let's… let's worry about… let's try Agent Mode later. Agent mode is actually very…

403
00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:56.020
Simon Wang: it's, it's, it's amazing, you know, HMO is amazing. But for beginners, let's, let's start with the ask mode, because you will have more control. HMO is like, they will take over.

404
00:59:56.200 --> 01:00:12.710
Simon Wang: the HMO will take over and do everything for you. All you have to do, just continue, continue, and they will do everything for you. But for our purpose, let's still do a little bit of copy and paste, all right? So I hope this has helped you a bit more, but do raise your hand,

405
01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:23.479
Simon Wang: you have questions. You know, if you have no idea what's going on, that's… that's normal, okay? Don't… don't worry, that's normal. Just… just raise your hand, and we'll help you.

406
01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:31.949
Simon Wang: And for the computer science majors, do you want to stand up so you can get… you can offer some help?

407
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:54.879
Simon Wang: Alright, anyone needs help? Yeah.

408
01:13:55.150 --> 01:14:01.120
