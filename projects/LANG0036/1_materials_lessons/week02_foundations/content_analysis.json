    "text": "Alright, so for the first two weeks, we're going to record, our lecture on Zoom. And, you should be able to refer to the Zoom recording. And again, this is the second week of our course, GCAP 3226, and please come to the Zoom, including those who are watching this video, you can come to the… our, Moodle classroom, and, you should be able to, find the… Week 1 video, and also transcripts. just to catch up, you know, I know some of you were not here last week, so if you want to catch up, you want to know more about this course, what we're trying to do, you can just, well, I mean, you probably don't want to watch the whole video, but there's actually transcripts available you can take a look as well. Now, please go to, week 2 notes. So, as you can see, we've got in-class and after-class discussion, and then we have week two notes. So, just a little bit of recap. I think I have already talked about this, but, the basic course objectives are here. I don't want to necessarily repeat myself. Y..."

    "text": "from different, measuring the attitude of the respondents from different, aspects. For example, for this second question, according to the polluter-pays Principle. Do you think charging by the amount of garbage can fairly Reflect the environmental burden of different families. So this question measure the perceived fairness of this policy. And I think it's reasonable to assume that if people tend to believe that this policy is fair. Then, it's likely that They will support, they will, like, more support this policy. So this is one possible influencing factor. Another perspective is, Do you think the government has fully considered the opinions Of citizens from different social classes. When formulating this garbage charging policy. So this is another aspect. It's the responsiveness to the public opinion when making this policy. So… I think, again, it's very likely that if the respondents believe that the government has fully considered the opinions of citizens, then it's likely that th..."

Do you mind raising your hand? Not many. I think during the break, you can still do it. Just follow the reference book, which I screenshot yesterday, sent you by email. So, from there, we can, download the… this is the code editor, which is called VS Code, that we will use to write, write Python code. So here shows the interface of this VS Code. because there are, I would say, many panels in this interface, so I think it's still useful to briefly talk about the structures. Overall, on the left-hand side, here is the activity bar. The most, commonly used one should be this, so you see these blocks? So this shows the extensions you need to install to open the Jupyter Notebook file we provided. And… Next to it is a sidebar. Which shows the folder you opened, and the scripts, or the notebook files in the directory. ..."
