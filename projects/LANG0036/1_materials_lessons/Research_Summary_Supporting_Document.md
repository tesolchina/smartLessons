# Research Summary: Signal No. 8 Data Analysis (September 8-9, 2025)

## Executive Summary
Academic research team at HKBU developed real-time wind monitoring system to study typhoon signal accuracy. Analysis of September 8-9, 2025 Signal No. 8 event revealed discrepancies between publicly available wind data and signal criteria decisions.

## Key Findings

### 1. Signal Maintenance Decision
- **Unusual Practice**: Early announcement of Signal No. 8 maintenance until 11:00 AM on September 9, 2025
- **Research Concern**: Earlier than usual commitment to specific signal duration
- **Impact**: Affected public planning and business operations

### 2. Wind Data Analysis
- **Monitoring Scope**: 30 weather stations via HKO public APIs
- **Observation Period**: Continuous 10-minute intervals during Signal No. 8 event
- **Key Finding**: Wind measurements frequently did not meet official Signal No. 8 criteria
- **Criteria**: Signal No. 8 requires â‰¥50% of reference stations recording sustained winds of 63-117 km/h

### 3. Data Sources Used
**Working HKO APIs:**
- `https://data.weather.gov.hk/weatherAPI/opendata/weather.php?dataType=warnsum&lang=en`
- `https://portal.csdi.gov.hk/server/services/common/hko_rcd_1634953844424_88011/MapServer/WFSServer`
- RSS feeds: CurrentWeather.xml and WeatherWarningBulletin.xml

### 4. Technical Implementation
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live monitoring of all 30 stations
- **Signal Calculation**: Automated assessment based on published HKO criteria
- **Data Logging**: CSV archives for historical analysis
- **Comparison Tool**: Official signal vs. calculated signal analysis

## Research Questions Requiring Official Data Verification

1. **Wind Threshold Compliance**: How many reference stations actually met Signal No. 8 criteria during the event?

2. **Decision Timing**: What meteorological factors justified the early maintenance announcement?

3. **Reference Station Performance**: Were all 8 reference anemometers operational and providing accurate data?

4. **Forecast Accuracy**: How did actual conditions compare to the models used for signal decisions?

## Academic Significance

### Public Interest Value
- **Transparency**: Public understanding of signal decision-making
- **Safety**: Accuracy of public warning systems
- **Research**: Contributing to meteorological science
- **Policy**: Evidence-based improvements to warning systems

### Methodology Transparency
- Open-source monitoring system
- Publicly available data sources
- Reproducible analysis methods
- Academic peer review process

## Data Request Justification

### Code on Access to Information Compliance
- **Academic Purpose**: Legitimate research at recognized institution
- **Public Interest**: Transparency in public safety decisions
- **Scientific Merit**: Contributing to meteorological research
- **Responsible Use**: Proper attribution and academic standards

### Specific Data Needs
1. **Verification Data**: Official measurements to validate our findings
2. **Decision Context**: Understanding the meteorological reasoning
3. **System Performance**: Reference station operational status
4. **Communication Timeline**: Official announcement decision points
