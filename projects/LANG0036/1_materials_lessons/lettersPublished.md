During the Christmas holidays, public hospitals were again overwhelmed by patients infected with seasonal influenza.

While recruiting private doctors and leasing beds from private hospitals could alleviate the shortage of health services in public hospitals, the government should also make more concerted efforts to promote influenza vaccination among the vulnerable groups in the city, especially schoolchildren.

According to Department of Health data, about 65,000 primary schoolchildren received flu shots in the 2016-17 flu season, so only 18.7 per cent of the 349,008 primary schoolchildren were protected through the subsidy vaccination programmes. Given the relatively low participation rate in these programmes by schoolchildren, the Education Bureau must offer more incentives for school principals to educate parents and schoolchildren about the benefits of taking flu shots.

In this flu season, the bureau has distributed the Centre for Health Protection letter “2017/18 Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Arrangement for Children” to primary schools, kindergartens and child care centres. But, the bureau does not collect data from schools about how many schoolchildren have had flu shots. Schools are not required to inform the bureau whether they have arranged vaccination activity on campus for students following the Department of Health recommendation.

To hold school principals accountable for promoting flu vaccinations, the bureau should collect data about vaccination administration for schoolchildren from individual schools and develop an incentive scheme to reward schools where the children are more active in taking flu shots. More resources should also be provided to schools so children can be inoculated more conveniently on campus.

To better inform public health policymaking, a more comprehensive health record system is needed to monitor flu infection cases among schoolchildren. The Centre for Health Protection monitors the activity of seasonal influenza in the community through tracking the influenza-like illness consultation rates at 64 general outpatient clinics under the Hospital Authority and around 50 private general practitioners. Yet, the data has no breakdown into age groups. Nor are the vaccination records of the individual patients collected by the system.

The Department of Health should collaborate with the Education Bureau to collect more data about influenza and vaccination activity in order to assess the overall effectiveness of influenza vaccination and target flu shot promotion to schoolchildren with a higher risk of flu infection.

During the 2016/17 flu season, more than 700,000 individuals in Hong Kong have received free or subsidised vaccinations for seasonal influenza.

The number of vaccines administered under the government vaccination programme and vaccination subsidy scheme have increased by 4.7 per cent and 46.4 per cent compared to 2015/16. Nevertheless, the number of seasonal influenza virus infections by October 21 had reached 26,605, already exceeding the total number of 21,218 cases in 2016.

To better protect the city against seasonal flu, the government should promote the vaccination programmes more aggressively, and further reduce the vaccination cost through the centralised ordering of vaccines.

In response to my inquiry, the Department of Health said 1.5 million Hong Kong residents were eligible for free vaccination under the vaccination programme and 1.9 million for subsidised vaccination under the subsidy scheme. These numbers include about a million senior citizens who are covered by both plans. Taking out a million to avoid double counting, it is estimated that 2.4 million people are eligible for free or subsidised flu shots.

Considering the low participation rate of the GVP and VSS combined (about 29 per cent), the department should devote more resources to marketing its vaccination programmes.

Mobile vaccination vehicles should be used to make the vaccines more accessible around the city. Vaccination teams should be sent to kindergartens, primary and secondary schools to inoculate children.

In 2016/17, the government purchased 430,000 doses of vaccines, and only 10,000 doses were discarded at the end.

Given the government’s impressive accuracy in predicting the number of vaccines required, the department should also help private doctors under the VSS to purchase the vaccines.

According to a flu vaccine manufacturer in the US, it is always challenging to estimate the demand for vaccines, forcing consumers to share the cost of discarded doses. Therefore, the cost of the flu shots could be further reduced if the government centralised the annual purchase of flu vaccines in Hong Kong.

In 2000, a universal influenza immunisation programme was introduced in Ontario, Canada, to provide free shots to everyone older than six months. Research suggested that this programme was economically attractive, as it halved influenza-related health care costs and brought more years of health to the citizens.

To battle influenza in the city, the government should consider experimenting with a similar universal vaccination programme.

Due to the severe influenza outbreak in January, local kindergartens and primary schools had to close early for Lunar New Year, while the hospitals struggled to take care of flu patients.
Considering the relatively low vaccination rates among children, the Department of Health has planned to inoculate more schoolchildren on campus through an outreach programme in the 2018-19 flu season. A similar outreach programme was launched in 2017-18, but only about 24,000 children from 54 primary schools and 7,800 children from 60 kindergartens received vaccinations.
To better protect children, the government should introduce a comprehensive monitoring system for influenza activity among them and target the more vulnerable groups of children to promote flu shots.

Since some parents are sceptical about the effectiveness of flu vaccination, stronger evidence is needed about how well flu shots can protect children.
According to a recent study led by the University of Hong Kong, influenza vaccination could reduce infection rates by 65 per cent for children aged six months to 17 years. However, the study was based on data collected from 1,078 children admitted to two hospitals between December 4, 2017 and January 31, 2018. Without more comprehensive data on infected children, it is not possible to more precisely assess vaccination effectiveness among different age groups. The researchers were also unable to study the vaccination efficacy among outpatients.

To more accurately assess vaccination effectiveness, the Department of Health should create an influenza record file for every child in the city. In addition to data from government vaccination programmes, flu shot records of children should also be collected from private clinics and private hospitals.

Influenza activity among children should be monitored more precisely in both public and private hospitals, and through kindergartens and schools, which may be asked by the Education Bureau to report the days of absenteeism due to influenza.

Such a monitoring system may provide more information for the government to decide which groups of children need the flu vaccination more urgently and allocate resources accordingly. Parents and school principals can also make more informed decisions on whether to join the outreach programme for flu vaccination.
