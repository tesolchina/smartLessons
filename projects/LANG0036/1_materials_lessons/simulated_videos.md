### John — Strong Level

#### Transcript
"Hi everyone, I'm John Chen from Hong Kong. Three words that describe me would be analytical, adaptable, and ambitious. I'm analytical because I always try to understand the deeper reasons behind things. Being adaptable comes from growing up between Eastern and Western cultures, and ambitious - well, I believe in setting high goals for myself.

My background has significantly influenced how I view global citizenship. Growing up in Hong Kong, a place where East meets West, I've experienced firsthand how different cultures can coexist and enrich each other. I spent my high school years in both local and international schools, which gave me a unique perspective on cross-cultural communication and understanding.

To me, being a global citizen means taking responsibility beyond national boundaries. It's about understanding that our actions have global implications, whether it's about environmental sustainability or social justice. I believe global citizens should actively seek to understand different perspectives and work towards solutions that benefit the wider global community. This doesn't mean losing our cultural identity, but rather using it as a foundation to build bridges with others."
