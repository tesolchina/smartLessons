please check if there are any students misalignment between the two list and report results below 


Let me analyze the student lists to check for any misalignments between the complete section 37 list and the group assignments.

Thinking

## ✅ **Student List Analysis Results**

**NO MISALIGNMENTS FOUND** - All student lists are perfectly aligned.

### **Summary:**

- **Total Section 37 Students**: 16
- **Students in Group Assignments**: 16
- **Missing Students**: 0
- **Duplicate Assignments**: 0

### **Group Distribution Verification:**

- **Group 37.1** (Week 3, Hour 1): 4 students - All BA Visual Arts
- **Group 37.2** (Week 3, Hour 2): 4 students - Mixed (2 BA Visual Arts + 2 Bachelor of Science)
- **Group 37.3** (Week 4, Hour 1): 4 students - All BCOMM GDA
- **Group 37.4** (Week 4, Hour 2): 4 students - Mixed (1 Bachelor of Science + 3 BCOMM GDA)

### **Additional Observations:**

1. **Program Distribution is Balanced:**

   - BA Visual Arts: 7 students
   - BCOMM GDA: 6 students
   - Bachelor of Science: 3 students
2. **Group Organization Strategy:**

   - Groups are organized by academic program where possible
   - Mixed groups maintain academic diversity
   - Equal group sizes (4 students each)

All students from the complete Section 37 list are properly assigned to exactly one group with no overlaps or omissions. The group assignments are ready for implementation in Weeks 3 and 4.
