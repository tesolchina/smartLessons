To what extent do you agree or disagree? 
 
My original outline: 
In my opinion, although the internet increased cybercrime and collect people privacy, the internet is more convenience for our life. People can obtain the information they need more quickly on the internet, use communication software to send messages to friends or family, and make reservations or purchase goods online. So I believe the benefits of internet outweigh the drawbacks.
