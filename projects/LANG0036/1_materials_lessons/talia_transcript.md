## Questionnaire Design Methodology - Part 1

### Attitude Measurement Framework

We are measuring the **attitude of the respondents from different aspects**. For example, for this second question:

> "According to the polluter-pays principle, do you think charging by the amount of garbage can fairly reflect the environmental burden of different families?"

So this question measures the **perceived fairness** of this policy. And I think it's reasonable to assume that if people tend to believe that this policy is fair, then it's likely that they will support—they will have more support for this policy. So this is one possible influencing factor.

### Key Dimensions of Policy Perception

#### 1. Perceived Fairness
Another perspective is:
> "Do you think the government has fully considered the opinions of citizens from different social classes when formulating this garbage charging policy?"

So this is another aspect—it's the **responsiveness to the public opinion** when making this policy. I think, again, it's very likely that if the respondents believe that the government has fully considered the opinions of citizens, then it's likely that they will support this policy.

#### 2. Perceived Effectiveness  
Another possible perspective is:
> "How helpful do you think the waste charging policy will be in reducing the total waste volume?"

So this question measures the **helpfulness, or perceived helpfulness**, of this policy to reduce the total waste volume. So, if the respondents believe that this policy is helpful to reduce the waste, then it is likely that there will be support for this policy.

#### 3. Perceived Severity
And the last question in this section is:
> "How severe do you think Hong Kong's current waste management issues are?"

So this measures the **perceived severity** of the waste management situation in Hong Kong. So, supposedly, if the respondents feel that the waste management issue in Hong Kong is already severe enough, then it's likely that they will support this policy.

## Questionnaire Design Methodology - Part 2

### Data Coding and Ordinal Scales

Okay, so later in the **CSV file**, you will see the support info. So that question refers to this first question, and you will see that **1, 2, 3, 4, 5**, which represents different options.

Because this type of question has an **ordinal sense**, so it starts from:
- **Strongly opposed** → **Strongly support**

So this contains the order in these options, so it is reasonable to use **1, 2, 3, 4, 5** to code these options. That's the reason later in the CSV file, you will not see the exact wordings, like "strongly oppose," "oppose." Instead, you will see **numbers, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5**.

### Conceptual vs. Practical Perspectives

And so for this study, you can actually observe that it measures—or it explores—the **potential influencing factors of the level of support from a conceptual perspective**.

So, people's:
- **Perceived fairness**
- **Perceived responsiveness to public opinion**

These are all from the **conceptual perspective**, rather than a practical perspective.

### Practical Implementation Challenges

So during the discussion for this—whether we should really implement this policy—there are actually many **practical controversies**. 

Like, I think one of the most commonly seen discussion or mentioned difficulty of implementing this policy is about the **number of recycling facilities in community is not enough**. Right?

Because if the recycling facilities are not enough, then even if people want to reduce the waste, want to do recycling, then there's no enough support.

#### Real-World Example
I'm not sure whether you have observed this: you want to recycle some items, and you bring them to the recycle bin, but it turns out that **the recycle bin is already full**.

So these may imply that the overall:
- Either the **amount of the recycling facilities is not enough**
- Or, the **manpower to timely empty those bins is not enough**

### Data-Driven Decision Making

But then the question is: **Do we have such data?** Do we have such data to measure the existing **utility rate for the recycling facilities**?

#### Scenario Analysis

**Scenario 1: Low Utilization**
> Suppose if we have such data, say we found that only **30% of the existing recycling bins** are used. The utility rate is really low. Then this would not be a controversy anymore, because data shows us that there's enough facility. Then the focus of the government should be to **promote or encourage people to do the recycling**. Right. Then the facility itself is not an issue.

**Scenario 2: High Utilization**
> But if it turns out that data shows that **90% of the facility is used**, or even sometimes is overused, then the resources need to be put in either to:
> - **Increase the amount of recycling facilities**, or 
> - **Increase the manpower** to timely empty those existing recycling bins

### Research Questions for Policy Implementation

So this decision will be based on the data, and whether we have such data, whether the government has collected such data, whether we can access such kind of data. So these might be the problems that we can try to:
- **Inquire those officers**
- **Try to find on the internet**
- **Try to search for**

#### Planning Stage Analysis
And even when we step back, thinking of **at the planning stage** of putting those recycling facilities in the community:

> How exactly did the government make the decision? Say we have **18 districts in Hong Kong** with different number of population, with different demographic features. And when those recycling facilities were put or were planned to put in different districts, what kind of information is used to make such decision?

**Key Questions:**
- Do they consider the **population**?
- Do they consider the **average age** of the resident in that area?
- Or do they even consider the **education level**?
- What kind of factors do they consider when they make the decision to put certain amount of facilities in those communities?

#### Evaluation Mechanisms
So that will be another question that I think you can think of. And if we go one step further:

> **To what extent** the recycling for citizens is enough. So how can the government set the **evaluation mechanisms** to dynamically evaluate the usage of these facilities?

I think this is also a question that we can think of when we consider about the level of support for the policy from the **practical perspective**.

### Study Focus Summary

So for this specific questionnaire, it focused on the **influencing factors of level of support from the conceptual level**. And maybe later in your group project, you may consider this problem from a **more practical perspective**.

## Questionnaire Structure

### Section 1: Assessment of Policy Support
✅ *Already discussed above*

### Section 2: Household Waste Disposal and Recycling Habits

This section covers:
- **Number of bags** the household disposes of daily
- **Frequency of the recycling behavior**
- **Time and effort** that is typically taken to recycle the items
- **Whether you have seen** food waste recycling bins

So, as mentioned, these are all **potential influencing factors** of the level of support.

Oh, except for this fourth question. This is just collecting information about the **seeing frequency** of this waste—food waste recycle bin. And if the respondents had seen this food waste recycling bin before, then the next question will be asked: 

> "Have you ever used the food waste recycling bins?"

### Section 3: Knowledge of Recycling

The third part is about **some knowledge of the recycling**. I think the assumption behind these three questions is:

> If the person really cares about the environment, or he has much knowledge about the recycling, then possibly they will have a **higher support level** for the waste charging policy.

I will quickly fill some options here. So these are, overall, this section **tests the knowledge**.

### Section 4: Re-evaluation of Policy Support

And the fourth section is actually a **re-evaluation of the policy support**. So here, the designer of this questionnaire shows **two pieces of information** regarding this policy and sees whether this information will affect the level of support for the respondents.

#### Information Piece 1: Urgency Warning
So the first key information is that, actually, **Hong Kong's landfills are nearing capacity**. So it says:

> "Based on the current daily waste intake, both landfills are projected to reach **full capacity by next year**."

So this works like a **warning**. Like, the severity of Hong Kong's waste management is actually quite high. It's very severe now. We're facing this situation.

#### Information Piece 2: Success Story
And the second piece of information shows a **successful case** of a nearby country, **South Korea**, which implemented this waste charging policy in **1995**, and it turns out that after over **30 years**, the **recycling rate has reached 60%**.

#### Testing Information Impact
So the designer would like to test whether receiving these two pieces of information made, to some extent, change the level of support of the respondents.

So, if it turns out that this kind of information might be helpful to improve the level of support, then maybe later in **promotion of such policy**, we may use the same strategy.

#### Data Visualization Goals
So later, you will really **visualize the data**, so before the showing up of these two pieces of information, naturally, what is, on average, the **support rate** for this policy.

And then there's another variable, which captures the **level of supportness after** the respondents received this information. And hopefully you will be curious about whether there's any **change of the support level** after showing this information.

### Section 5: Demographic Information

And the last section is the **demographic information**. These are quite commonly seen:
- Are you a **permanent resident**?
- What is the **highest education level**?
- **Household size**?
- Which **districts** you live in?
- What's the **type of housing** do you live in?
- **Age interval**?
- **Household monthly income range**?

So again, these are all **potential influencing factors** to the level of support for this garbage charging policy.

## Conclusion

So this is the **overall structure of this questionnaire**. And as mentioned, today, the focus is to do **visualization**.

To really test the association between these potential influencing factors to the response, we will have to use certain models, as mentioned, the **regression model**, to capture their relationships. But that will be the focus of [*transcript continues*]...
