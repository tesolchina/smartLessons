## 🌟 **Key Technical Achievements**

### 1. **Real-Time Data Processing**
```python
# Continuous 10-minute monitoring cycle
def monitor_loop(self):
    while self.is_running:
        self.fetch_wind_data()          # Get latest readings
        self.calculate_overall_signal()  # Apply HKO criteria
        time.sleep(600)                 # Wait 10 minutes
```

### 2. **Official Signal Assessment**  
```python  
# Implements exact HKO criteria from your requirements
signal8_stations = len([s for s in active_stations 
                       if s['last_wind_speed'] >= 63])
                       
if signal8_stations >= total_stations / 2:
    self.overall_signal = 8  # Signal 8 triggered
```

### 3. **Live Dashboard Interface**
- **Color-coded indicators** for Signal levels (Green/Yellow/Red)
- **Real-time table** showing all 30 stations with current wind speeds  
- **Statistics cards** displaying Signal 3+ and Signal 8+ station counts
- **Auto-refresh** every 10 minutes synchronized with data updates

### 4. **Public Transparency**
- **Complete data source documentation** on `/about` page
- **Methodology explanation** showing exactly how signals are calculated  
- **Emergency contact information** and official HKO references
- **Disclaimer** clarifying this is for informational purposes only
