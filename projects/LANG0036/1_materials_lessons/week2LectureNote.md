- **Generates Python code** automatically
- **Suggests complete solutions** to data analysis tasks
- **Explains code** when you ask

### **How to Use Copilot Effectively:**

#### **1. Write Clear Prompts:**
```python
# Write code to load week2.csv into a pandas DataFrame and show the first five rows
```
‚úÖ **Good:** Specific, clear task
‚ùå **Bad:** `# do data stuff`

#### **2. Use Step-by-Step Instructions:**
```python
# Write code to create bar charts for support_info and support_after_info
# Put the plots in a 1x2 grid
# Label the 1-5 scale as 1=Strongly oppose, 5=Strongly support
```

#### **3. Ask for Modifications:**
```python
# Modify the chart above to use different colors and add a title
```

#### **2. Matplotlib** üìä
- **What it does:** Creates charts and graphs
- **Your role:** Request "create a bar chart" or "make a pie chart"
- **Copilot's role:** Generates `plt.figure()`, `plt.bar()`, etc.

#### **3. Seaborn** üé®
- **What it does:** Makes beautiful, professional visualizations
- **Your role:** Ask for "attractive bar chart" or "professional styling"
- **Copilot's role:** Generates `sns.countplot()`, `sns.scatterplot()`, etc.

### **Key Visualization Types You'll Master:**

#### **üìä Bar Charts** - Compare categories
- **When to use:** Comparing support levels across districts
- **Policy value:** Show public opinion differences by area

#### **ü•ß Pie Charts** - Show proportions
- **When to use:** Overall support distribution
- **Policy value:** Communicate simple percentages to officials

#### **üìà Scatter Plots** - Show relationships
- **When to use:** Distance vs. recycling behavior
- **Policy value:** Identify factors that influence policy success

#### **üì¶ Box Plots** - Show data distribution

- **Don't worry about:** Python syntax or technical details

### **2. Use Copilot Chat for Explanations**
- **Type:** "Explain what this scatter plot shows"
- **Or:** "What policy insights can we draw from this bar chart?"

### **3. Think Like a Policy Analyst**
- **For each chart ask:** 
  - What does this tell us about citizen opinions?
  - How could this inform policy decisions?
  - What additional questions does this raise?

### **4. Practice with Variations**
```python
# Create the same chart but with different colors
# Add a title that explains the policy relevance  
# Save this chart as a PNG file for a report
```

### **5. Connect to Real Policy Issues**
- **Think:** "How would I present this to the Hong Kong government?"
- **Consider:** "What policy changes does this data suggest?"
