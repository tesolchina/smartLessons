Subject: Code on Access to Information Request - Signal No. 8 Research Data (Sept 8-9, 2025)

Dear HKO Data Services Team,

**REQUEST UNDER CODE ON ACCESS TO INFORMATION**

I am Dr. Simon Wang from Hong Kong Baptist University, requesting information under the Code on Access to Information Ordinance for academic research on typhoon signal accuracy.

**RESEARCH CONTEXT:**
Our HKBU team has developed a real-time wind monitoring system analyzing HKO's public APIs. During the September 8-9, 2025 Signal No. 8 event, our analysis identified potential discrepancies between publicly available wind measurements and signal criteria, particularly regarding the early announcement to maintain Signal No. 8 until 11:00 AM on September 9.

**SPECIFIC INFORMATION REQUESTED (Sept 8-9, 2025):**

1. **Official Wind Data:**
   - Raw 10-minute wind measurements from the 8 reference anemometer stations
   - Timestamps when stations met/exceeded Signal No. 8 criteria (63-117 km/h)
   - Quality control and validation records

2. **Decision Documentation:**
   - Internal assessments for Signal No. 8 timing decisions
   - Rationale for the early 11:00 AM maintenance announcement
   - Weather models and typhoon predictions used

3. **Reference Station Information:**
   - Confirmation of which 8 stations were active reference points
   - Any technical issues or maintenance during the event

4. **Communication Timeline:**
   - Official signal announcement timestamps
   - Decision points for signal maintenance commitments

**RESEARCH PURPOSE:**
This academic study aims to enhance public understanding of typhoon warning systems and contribute to meteorological research on signal accuracy. Our findings will be published with proper HKO attribution.

**DATA SHARING:**
We are transparent about our methodology and can share our publicly collected 30-station wind data that prompted this research inquiry.

**JUSTIFICATION:**
This request serves public interest by supporting academic research on public safety systems and enhancing transparency in government meteorological decision-making.

**PREFERRED FORMAT:** CSV for data, PDF for documentation

**CONTACT:**

We appreciate your consideration and look forward to contributing to improved understanding of Hong Kong's typhoon warning system through responsible academic research.

Best regards,
Dr. Simon Wang
Hong Kong Baptist University
