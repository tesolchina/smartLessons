got this folder and this note https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SW5piiXMRLV0pErR2Z1lL6dsTbtzT1L6wKLYue8rLIw/edit?tab=t.0

send the doc to LLM Grok-4 and create a few new docs and folder 

I think we need a folder for sample student essays 

we also need a folder for different prompts that can customize different chatbots 

we need a framework to decide what to teach students taking into account the rubrics
