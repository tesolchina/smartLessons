Criteria for Increasing Bus Frequency
‚ÄúFor individual bus routes, if the passenger load factor reaches 90% 
during the busiest half-hour and 75% during the busiest hour of peak 
periods, or 60% during the busiest hour of off-peak periods, the 
department and the franchised bus company will consider increasing 
the service frequency.‚Äù

Questions

The passenger load factor of City Bus No. 56, as reported in the proposal, is 32% 
during the busiest hour (before adjustment). However, it is unclear:

oHow this passenger load factor is defined

oWhen the busiest hour occurs

oWhether the 32% represents an average across different stops and shifts

oHow an increase in bus frequency is justified given a passenger load factor of 
32%

Objectives
oTo develop and analyze a simulation of Bus Route 56 operations during the 
morning using field data and estimated arrival times (ETA) from 
https://data.gov.hk/en/.

oTo assess the justification for route and frequency adjustments to Bus No.56 by 
estimating the seat utilization rate via simulation.

oTo provide evidence-based policy recommendations.

8

Key processes 

To calculate the seat utilization rate, we need to count the passengers on bus at each 
stop. 

oThe bus stops at every station; the travel time between each pair of stops is random.

oAt each stop, the number of waiting passengers is random.

oAt each stop, the number of passengers getting off is random.

9

Travel time
oThe bus travel time between each pair of stops is modelled as a random variable 
drawn from a normal distribution, with the mean and standard deviation 
estimated from sample data.

oUsing the API, we collected ETA at each stop for 30 trips of Bus No. 56.

oWe then calculated the mean and standard deviation of travel times between 
each pair of stops. For each simulation run, we sampled travel times from the 
corresponding normal distributions to represent the bus travel times between 
stops.

10

Number of waiting passengers

oThe number of waiting passengers at each stop is modelled as a random 
variable drawn from a Poisson distribution.

oùùÄ  ‚àí the average number of occurrences in the 
time interval. It is estimated by field observation.

11

Number of passengers getting off
oThe number of passengers getting off at each stop is modelled as a random 
variable drawn from a Binomial distribution.

SimPy

1. Initialization: Global variables are reset for each simulation run

2. Environment Creation: A new SimPy environment is created

3. Process Scheduling: Multiple bus processes are scheduled with different departure 
times

4. Concurrent Execution: All bus processes run concurrently, each following their route

5. Event-Driven Progression: Each bus process yields control during travel times, 
allowing other buses to operate

6. Data Collection: Each process records utilization data as it progresses

7. Simulation End: Runs until all buses complete their journeys

Result - existing forward (after adjustment)

In 1000 simulation:

oMedian of seat 
utilization: 

12% - 34%

14

Result - existing return (after adjustment)

In 1000 simulation:

oMedian of seat 
utilization: 

5% - 34%

15

Result ‚Äì forward, before adjustment

In 1000 simulation:

oMedian of seat 
utilization: 

18% - 56%, based 
on estimated 
passenger flow at 
the removed bus 
stops.

16

Result ‚Äì return, before adjustment

In 1000 simulation:

oMedian of seat 
utilization: 

8% - 58%

17

Result - Summary

oThe adjustment appears to have reduced overall seat utilization rate. 

oThe decision to increase bus frequency should also be analysed from the 
perspective of operating costs.

Enquiry to Department of Transportation

1. 

Operational and Passenger Flow Data:

What types of operational and passenger flow data (e.g., stop-level boarding and 
alighting, peak/off-peak passenger counts) were collected and analyzed when assessing 
the rerouting and schedule changes for Routes 56 and 56A?
2. 

Service Quality Evaluation:

What quantitative models or criteria (such as load factor thresholds, predicted waiting 
times, or cost-benefit analyses) were used to evaluate whether the service 
modifications would maintain or improve passenger service quality?
3. 

Data Accessibility:

Are the relevant operational datasets, consultation summaries, or evaluation models 
available for public or academic review? If so, how can these be accessed? If not, would 
the Transport Department consider releasing anonymized or summarized data in 
accordance with the Code on Access to Information?
