Hello. My name is Wan Choi Yi, or you can call me Koi. So to use free word to describe myself, I would say it is creative, curious and focused. So to start first, since I'm official art student, in order to create a good artwork, it is important to receive different creative ideas, different information from others. And secondly, I would say I'm a person who driven by questions, not just the answers. I always want to know the why behind the question. And also, I'm a person who focus to achieve my goals instead of working with others. I like to work a lot more so that I can focus my own job better. Therefore, I would use creative careers and focus to describe myself and to the next question, how does my background shape my field of global citizenship? I think global citizenship is not only the government but also the individuals. It is the connection between you and me. Build up the bridges which call community.

I believe observing myself is a good way to understand who am I. I describe myself as a considerate person is because i strive to understand and connect with people from all walks from life. And finally, I say curious because I’m always eager to learn about new perspectives. Although I am relatively introverted and silent, I am definitely devoted.Growing up in a multicultural society taught me that there’s more than one way to see the world. Studying history in secondary school showed me how interconnected our global systems are. Also, studying in visual arts made me appreciate both our differences and our shared humanity. Also, recognising that I am part of a worldwide community, and my actions have an impact that extends beyond my immediate surroundings. The reason why global is global is because we are part of ...\n```\n\n### Completion Summary\n**Score:** 1/3 components\n- ✅ Raw Transcript\n- ❌ Error Analysis\n- ❌ Self-Assessment\n**Status:** 🟡 PARTIAL SUBMISSION\n\n---\n\n## XIE Kai Wing\n**Section:** 37\n**Total Posts:** 1\n\n### Post 1: Re: section 37 reply here \n- **Posted:** 2025-09-11 20:26:07\n- **Word Count:** 974\n- **Content Type:** 📝 Raw Transcript, 🔍 Error Analysis, 📊 Self-Assessment\n\n**Full Content:**\n```\nStep 1: Raw Transcript (Provided) 
Hello everyone, I’m Xie Kai Wing and my study program is visual arts. By choosing three words to describe myself, I will choose curious, connective and friendly. So I like to exchange ideas with other people and make friends. During my middle school years, I have studied world history, and one of the topics that we learned is international cooperation. We studied how countries around the world that cooperate in areas such as healthcare, economic and environment to address common global challenges, and this led me to believe that being a global citizen means people from different backgrounds offering help when others are in need, that will create a better life for everyone, because we are getting more help from other countries like this, and for example, we can follow some natural disasters in other countries through television news. And that's donating online, to share, to show our care to them, and also delivering some helpful materials like this, an...\n```\n\n### Completion Summary\n**Score:** 3/3 components\n- ✅ Raw Transcript\n- ✅ Error Analysis\n- ✅ Self-Assessment\n**Status:** 🌟 COMPLETE SUBMISSION\n\n---\n\n## ZHANG Zimu\n**Section:** 38\n**Total Posts:** 2\n\n### Post 1: section 38 reply here \n- **Posted:** 2025-09-09 19:39:50\n- **Word Count:** 187\n- **Content Type:** 📝 Raw Transcript\n\n**Full Content:**\n```\nOkay, when I first saw this question, my immediate reaction was that I really didn’t know how to answer it. But if I had to pick three words to describe myself, I’d probably go with: introverted, creative, and idealistic.         Introverted means… I don’t usually take the initiative to socialize; I prefer spending time alone.         As for being creative… honestly, throughout middle school and high school, I’ve enjoyed writing my own stories and drawing kinda abstract doodles.         And when it comes to idealism… I guess it’s like whenever I get an idea, I just want to go for it, and I kinda blindly believe that I can make it happen.         On the topic of global citizenship—I took a politics class in high school. It helped me understand the challenges that the whole world is facing together, and it also exposed me to lots of different cultures.         To me, a global citizen should have an international perspective, a sense of responsibility, the willingness to take action, and ...\n```\n\n### Post 2: Re: section 38 reply here \n- **Posted:** 2025-09-13 17:58:05\n- **Word Count:** 678\n- **Content Type:** 📝 Raw Transcript, 🔍 Error Analysis, 📊 Self-Assessment\n\n**Full Content:**\n```\n1.transcript You can call me Laura.Let's move on to the first question.When I first saw this question, actually, I have no idea about it, but if I have to choose three words to describe myself,I'd probably go with introverted, creative and idealisticabout the about theintroverted, it means That I do not often participate in social activities, I prefer to spend time alone,activity because I keep writing short novel since my middle school,when It comes to the idealistic,when Iwant to, want to do something.
