# Tasks for Ahmad - ZoteroMDsMineru3 Collaboration

**Date:** September 6, 2025  
**Repository:** https://github.com/tesolchina/ZoteroMDsMineru3

Dear Ahmad,

Thank you for the excellent foundation work on the ZoteroMDsMineru3 project. I've completed the initial repository organization and script analysis. Here are the key tasks I'd like to collaborate on with you:

## 🔧 **Immediate Priority Tasks**

### 1. PDF Source Upload 📁
**Request:** Upload all original PDFs to the forked repository

**Details:**
- We need access to the original PDF files that were processed through MinERU
- This will enable quality control assessment of the Markdown conversion
- Suggested organization: Create a `pdfs/` directory in the repository
- Consider organizing by batch (e.g., `pdfs/batch_001/`, `pdfs/batch_002/`) to match the current MD structure
- This will allow us to compare conversion quality and identify improvement areas

**Purpose:** Quality assurance and validation of the MinERU conversion process

### 2. Zotero Database Integration Documentation 📚
**Request:** Prepare/update documentation explaining Zotero database interaction

**Specific Areas to Cover:**
- **Database Schema**: How the tool connects to Zotero's SQLite database
- **Item Mapping**: Relationship between Zotero item IDs and processed files
- **Metadata Extraction**: What bibliographic data is preserved/extracted
- **Storage Paths**: How the tool locates PDF files in Zotero storage
- **API Integration**: If using Zotero Web API vs. local database access
- **Sync Considerations**: Handling of Zotero sync and multiple libraries

**Suggested Documentation Location:** `/docs/zotero-integration.md`

### 3. UI Frontend Development Plan 💻
**Request:** Develop a comprehensive plan for the user interface frontend

**Required Planning Areas:**

#### User Experience Design
- **Target Users**: Researchers, academics, librarians
- **User Journey**: From PDF upload to Markdown output
- **Interface Mockups**: Key screens and workflows
- **Responsive Design**: Desktop and mobile considerations

#### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend Framework**: React, Vue.js, or other recommendations
- **Integration Points**: How UI connects to backend processing
- **Real-time Updates**: Progress tracking during conversion
- **File Management**: Upload, preview, download interfaces

#### Feature Specifications
- **Batch Processing Interface**: Multiple file handling
- **Quality Control Dashboard**: Conversion assessment tools
- **Zotero Integration UI**: Library browsing and selection
- **Export Options**: Various output formats and destinations

**Suggested Documentation Location:** `/docs/frontend-plan.md`

## 📋 **Current Project Status**

### ✅ **Completed by tesolchina:**
- Repository forked and reorganized
- Script analysis completed (`GitUpMD5.py`, `mdMove.py`)
- Comprehensive workflow documentation created
- Project structure established with proper docs organization

### 🎯 **Next Collaborative Steps:**
1. **PDF Upload** → **Quality Assessment Framework**
2. **Zotero Integration Docs** → **Database Connection Architecture**
3. **Frontend Plan** → **Development Environment Setup**
4. **Joint Development** → **Online Tool Deployment**

## 🤝 **Collaboration Setup**

- **Primary Repository:** https://github.com/tesolchina/ZoteroMDsMineru3
- **Access**: Please accept collaboration invitation (to be sent)
- **Communication**: GitHub issues for task tracking
- **Development Branch Strategy**: Feature branches for major changes

## 📝 **Documentation Structure Ready**

```
docs/
├── 0notes.md              # Project status and task tracking
├── PROJECT_PLAN.md        # Overall project roadmap
├── workflow.md           # Technical workflow documentation
├── DATA_SUMMARY.md       # Statistical overview
├── zotero-integration.md  # [Your task] Database integration
└── frontend-plan.md      # [Your task] UI development plan
```

## 🚀 **Long-term Vision**

We're building towards a comprehensive online tool that:
- Seamlessly integrates with Zotero libraries
- Provides high-quality PDF-to-Markdown conversion
- Offers an intuitive web interface for researchers
- Maintains academic citation and metadata integrity

Your expertise in the MinERU processing and Zotero integration will be crucial for achieving these goals.

**Next Steps:**
1. Accept collaboration invitation on the forked repository
2. Review the current documentation and organization
3. Begin work on the three priority tasks above
4. Set up regular check-ins for progress coordination

Looking forward to our collaboration!

Best regards,  
**tesolchina**
