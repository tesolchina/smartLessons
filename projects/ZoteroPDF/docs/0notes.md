## New Tasks Added üöÄ

### Script Review ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Script Analysis**: Reviewed GitUpMD5.py and mdMove.py functionality  
- [x] **Workflow Documentation**: Created comprehensive `/docs/workflow.md`
- [x] **Technical Understanding**: Documented MinERU ‚Üí mdMove ‚Üí GitHub pipeline

### Scripts Summary:
1. **`mdMove.py`**: Organizes MinERU output by consolidating scattered MD files with Zotero ID prefixes
2. **`GitUpMD5.py`**: Advanced GitHub uploader with batch organization, rate limiting, error recovery, and content deduplication

### Quality Control Tasks üìã
- [ ] **PDF Source Retrieval**: Create mapping between Zotero IDs and original PDF locations
- [ ] **Conversion Quality Review**: Design assessment framework for MinERU conversion accuracy
- [ ] **Sample Validation**: Test conversion quality on representative documents
- [ ] **Error Pattern Analysis**: Identify common conversion issues (tables, math, citations)

### Online Deployment Planning üåê
- [ ] **Web Interface Design**: Create user-friendly upload and processing portal
- [ ] **Backend Architecture**: Python API (FastAPI/Flask) with MinERU integration  
- [ ] **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS/GCP/Azure deployment strategy
- [ ] **Authentication System**: GitHub OAuth for repository access
- [ ] **Processing Dashboard**: Real-time status tracking and quality metrics
- [ ] **Batch Processing**: Scale for multiple simultaneous conversions

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Map original PDF locations using Zotero database/storage paths
2. Design quality assessment metrics and testing framework  
3. Create web interface mockups and user experience flow
4. Set up development environment for online tool
