title: Journal of Second Language Writing Research Articles and Reviews
---

This volume of JSLW includes a total of eight research articles, annotated bibliography and two book reviews. We are happy to report that the research articles in this volume present studies conducted in various contexts such as Sweden, USA, UAE, Germany, Switzerland, Vietnam and Korea, representing a range of research topics and methods. The topics of the articles focus on writing processes comparison between the first (Swedish) and second (English) languages, task sequencing, verb argument constructions in argumentative essays, collaborative writing, the use of analytic rating in writing assessment, western-trained Vietnamese teachers’ EFL writing instruction, graduate students’ use of ChatGPT, and the usage-based approaches to assessing syntactic sophistication. The volume also presents the annotated bibliography of published books and articles over the last three months.

We are also thrilled to share that Dr. James Hartshorn from Brigham Young University has joined the editorial team as a new Associate Editor as of July 1, 2024. Welcome on board Dr. Hartshorn! We are looking forward to seeing editorial board members and audience of JSLW at the Symposium on Second Language Writing in Tucson.
