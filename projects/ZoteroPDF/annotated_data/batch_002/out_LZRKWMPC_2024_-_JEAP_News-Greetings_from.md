# JEAP News-Greetings from the BALEAP SIG Officer

Welcome to the 2024 JEAP Publication!

Last April I was honoured to assume the responsibility of 12 Special Interest Groups (SIGs) as the newly appointed SIG Officer. Our Special Interest Groups cover a wide variety of interests within the English for Academic Purposes field, namely:

• Academic Literacies   
• Creative Disciplines   
• Developing, Teaching and Testing Academic Listening   
• Doctoral Education   
• Law   
• Social Justice   
• STEM   
• Teacher Education in EAP   
• Technology Enhanced Learning   
• Testing, Assessment and Feedback   
• Transnational Education   
• In-sessional SIG

Our SIGs' main purpose is to help practitioners improve in their respective fields, find new opportunities, and strengthen themselves personally and professionally. In that respect, we are planning a series of online webinars in order to advertise new committee positions within our SIGs, highlighting the numerous benefits of those positions for professional development and enhancement of their work experience.

Another flagship event that we plan to launch this year is our SIG Day. This will comprise of an online conference with as many SIGs as possible showcasing their work and presenting interesting and relevant workshops and presentations. It will be organised around springtime 2024, paving the way for our next conference in 2025. Our main purpose is to establish this event in the next few years and offer our members a conference every year instead of every two years. The online nature of the event aims to attract more participants and speakers from all over the world, proving that BALEAP supports practitioners in all corners of the earth regardless of locations and time zones.

We trust these SIG events will be popular and build on a what has been a very successful 2023, creating new opportunities and further collaborations.
