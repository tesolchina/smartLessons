## Abstract

The present experiment tested the hypothesis that self-motivation through proximal goal setting serves as an effective mechanism for cultivating competencies, self-percepts of efficacy, and intrinsic interest. Children who exhibited gross deficits and disinterest in mathematical tasks pursued a program of self-directed learning under conditions involving either proximal subgoals, distal goals, or no goals. Results of the multifaceted assessment provide support for the superiority of proximal self-influence. Under proximal subgoals, children progressed rapidly in self-directed learning, achieved substantial mastery of mathematical operations, and developed a sense of personal efficacy and intrinsic interest in arithmetic activities that initially held little attraction for them. Distal goals had no demonstrable effects. In addition to its other benefits, goal proximity fostered veridical self-knowledge of capabilities as reflected in high congruence between judgments of mathematical self-efficacy and subsequent mathematical performance. Perceived self-efficacy was positively related to accuracy of mathematical performance and to intrinsic interest in arithmetic activities.

## Article

Much human behavior is directed and sustained over long periods, even though the external inducements for it may be few and far between. Under conditions in which external imperatives are minimal and discontinuous, people must partly serve as agents of their own motivation and action. In social learning theory (Bandura, 1977b, in press), self-directedness operates through a self system that comprises cognitive structures and subfunctions for perceiving, evaluating, motivating, and regulating behavior.

An important, cognitively based source of self-motivation relies on the intervening processes of goal setting and self-evaluative reactions to one's own behavior. This form of self-motivation, which operates largely through internal comparison processes, requires personal standards against which to evaluate ongoing performance. By making self-satisfaction conditional on a certain level of performance, individuals create self-inducements to persist in their efforts until their performances match internal standards. Both the anticipated satisfactions for matching attainments and the dissatisfactions with insufficient ones provide incentives for self-directed actions.

Personal goals or standards do not automatically activate the evaluative processes that affect the level and course of one's behavior. Certain properties of goals, such as their specificity and level, help to provide clear standards of adequacy (Latham & Yukl, 1975; Locke, 1968; Steers & Porter, 1974). Hence, explicit goals are more likely than vague intentions to engage self-reactive influences in any given activity. Goal proximity, a third property, is especially critical because the more closely referential standards are related to ongoing behavior, the greater the likelihood that self-influences will be activated during the process. Some suggestive evidence exists that the impact of goals on behavior is indeed determined by how far into the future they are projected (Bandura & Simon, 1977; Jeffery, 1977).

In the social learning view, adopting proximal subgoals for one's own behavior can have at least three major psychological effects. As already alluded to, such goals have motivational effects. One of the propositions tested in the present experiment is that self-motivation can be best created and sustained by attainable subgoals that lead to larger future ones. Proximal subgoals provide immediate incentives and guides for performance.

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

whereas distal goals are too far removed in time to effectively mobilize effort or to direct what one does in the here and now. Focus on the distant future makes it easy to temporize and to slacken efforts in the present. 

Proximal subgoals can also serve as an important vehicle in the development of self-percepts of efficacy. Competence in dealing with one's environment is not a fixed act or simply knowing what to do. Rather, it involves a generative capability in which component skills must be selected and organized into integrated courses of action to manage changing task demands. Operative competence thus requires flexible orchestration of multiple subskills. Self-efficacy is concerned with judgments about how well one can organize and execute courses of action required to deal with prospective situations containing many ambiguous, unpredictable, and often stressful elements. Self-percepts of efficacy can affect people's choice of activities, how much effort they expend, and how long they will persist in the face of difficulties (Bandura, 1977a; Brown & Inouye, 1978; Schunk, 1981).

Without standards against which to measure their performances, people have little basis for judging how they are doing or for gauging their capabilities. Subgoal attainments provide indicants of mastery for enhancing self-efficacy. By contrast, distal goals are too far removed in time to provide sufficiently clear markers of progress along the way to ensure a growing sense of self-efficacy.

The processes underlying the development of intrinsic interest may similarly be governed, at least in part, by goal proximity. Most of the activities that people enjoy doing for their own sake originally had little or no interest for them. Young children are not innately interested in singing operatic arias, playing tubas, deriving mathematical equations, writing sonnets, or propelling heavy shotput balls through the air. However, through favorable continued involvement, almost any activity can become imbued with consuming significance.

One can posit at least two ways in which proximal goals might contribute to enhancement of interest in activities. When people aim for, and master, desired levels of performance, they experience a sense of satisfaction (Locke, Cartledge, & Knerr, 1970). The satisfactions derived from subgoal attainments can build intrinsic interest. When performances are gauged against lofty, distal goals, the large negative disparities between standards and attainments are likely to attenuate the level of self-satisfaction experienced along the way.

Conceptual analyses of intrinsic interest within the framework of both self-efficacy theory (Bandura, 1981) and intrinsic motivation theory (Deci, 1975; Lepper & Greene, 1979) assign perceived competence a mediating role. A sense of personal efficacy in mastering challenges is apt to generate greater interest in the activity than is self-perceived inefficacy in producing competent performances. To the extent that proximal subgoals promote and authenticate a sense of causal agency, they can heighten interest through their effects on perception of personal causation.

Investigations of intrinsic interest have been concerned almost exclusively with the effects of extrinsic rewards on interest when it is already highly developed. Although results are somewhat variable, the usual finding is that rewards given regardless of quality of performance tend to reduce interest, whereas rewards for performances signifying competence sustain high interest (Boggiano & Ruble, 1979; Enzle & Ross, 1978; Lepper & Greene, 1979; Ross, 1976). The controversy over the effects of extrinsic rewards on preexisting high interest has led to a neglect of the issue of how intrinsic interest is developed when it is lacking. One of the present study's aims was to test the notion that proximal subgoals enlist the type of sustained involvement in activities that build self-efficacy and interest when they are absent.

Children who displayed gross deficits in mathematical skills and strong disinterest in such activities engaged in self-directe

## Method

## Subjects

The subjects were 40 children of predominantly middle-class backgrounds, ranging in age from 7.3 to 10.1 years, with a mean age of 8.4 years. There were 21 males and 19 females distributed equally by age and sex across conditions.

Children were drawn from six elementary schools. As an initial screening procedure, teachers identified children in their classes who displayed gross deficits in arithmetic skills and low interest in such activities. The pre-treatment procedures were administered to each of the identified children by one of two testers (a male and a female) to determine whether the children's arithmetic skills were sufficiently deficient to qualify for the experiment.

## Pretreatment Measures

The study was presented to the children as a project aimed at gaining understanding of how arithmetic skills are acquired. To reduce further any evaluative concerns, they were informed that the project was being conducted in several schools and that their work would be treated in full confidence.

### Mathematical Performance Test

The performance pretest consisted of 25 subtraction problems graded by level of difficulty. The test problems, which ranged from two to six columns, were specifically designed so as to tap each of seven subtraction operations that were included in the treatment phase of the study.

Of the 25 pretest problems, 8 were similar in form and difficulty to some of the types of items used in the subsequent treatment phase. To test for generalization effects, 17 problems required application of the various subtraction operations to problem forms that were more complex than those children would encounter in the self-instructional phase. For example, in treatment they learned how to borrow once or twice from zero in, at most, four-column problems, whereas a generalization item would require borrowing from three consecutive zeros in a six-column set. To add a further element of complexity, all the test problems were cast in a form in which the minuend and the difference between the minuend and the subtrahend were provided so that children had to solve the subtrahend.

Children were presented the set of 25 subtraction problems one at a time on separate pages and were instructed to turn each page over after they had solved the problem or had chosen not to work at it any longer. The tester recorded the time spent on each problem. The measure of competence in subtraction was the number of problems in which the children applied the correct subtraction operation.

Pilot work in the development of the test procedures revealed that children who do not fully comprehend subtraction operations fail to grasp the nature of their deficiency because they faithfully apply an erroneous algorithm. When presented with a subtraction problem, they simply subtract the smaller number from the larger one in each column regardless of whether the smaller number is the minuend or the subtrahend. To address this problem at the outset of the experiment proper, after children completed the arithmetic pretest they compared their solutions to the correct answers. However, children performed the posttest without feedback of accuracy.

Since this study centered on motivational processes by which competencies, perceived efficacy, and interest can be developed when they are lacking, children who solved more than four problems were excluded. The selected sample of children indeed exhibited gross deficits; one third could not solve a single problem, and another third could only solve one.

The children's substantial quantitative deficiencies were further confirmed by standardized measures of their mathematical ability obtained from the school district on three subtests of the Metropolitan Achievement Test (Durost, Bixler, Wrightstone, Prescott, & Balow, 1970). They occupied the bottom percentile ranks in computation (22), concepts (27), and problem solving (22). Children in the various treatment conditions did not differ in this respect.

### Self-Efficacy Judgment

Before measuring perceived mathematical efficacy, children performed a practice task to familiarize them with the efficacy assessment format. The tester stood at varying distances from the children and asked them to judge whether they could jump selected distances and to rate on a 100-point scale the degree of certainty of their perceived capability. In this concrete way, children learned how to use numerical scale values

## Treatment Conditions and Assessment

The situational arrangement for the instructional phase of the study was designed to leave the initiative to the children, thus allowing leeway for self-directedness and self-motivation to exert their effects. By working independently but in a group setting, none of the children was the focus of attention. The seating arrangement and sequential entry precluded communication between the children. After delivering the instructions, the experimenter retired to a table away from the children and remained as unobtrusive as possible throughout the sessions. By having children in different treatments pursue separately the self-directed learning in the same setting at the same time, social and situational factors that might otherwise vary were comparable across treatment conditions.

### Treatment Conditions

Children were assigned randomly to one of three treatment conditions or to a nontreated control group. The instructions, format, and materials for the self-directed study were identical across treatment conditions except for variations in goal setting.

- **Proximal goals**: For children in the proximal-goal treatment, the experimenter suggested that they might consider setting themselves a goal of completing at least six pages of instructional items each session. To give some salience to a continuing goal orientation, the suggestion of proximal goals was made at the beginning of the second session as well. There was no further mention of goals thereafter.

- **Distal goals**: For children assigned to the distal-goal treatment, the experimenter suggested that they might consider setting themselves the goal of completing the entire 42 pages of instructional items by the end of the seventh session, which comprised a total of 258 problems.

In both treatment conditions, the goals were mentioned suggestively rather than prescriptively so as to leave the goal-setting decision to the children. This mode of goal structuring was used for two reasons. First, it was designed to increase children's self-involvement in the instructional task. Second, choice increases the level of personal responsibility and commitment to goals.

- **No goals**: A third group of children pursued the self-directed learning without any reference to goals. However, they were told to try to complete as many pages of instructional items as possible as they went along. The reasons for including this particular condition were twofold: to provide a control for the effects of self-directed instruction alone and to equate the groups for the social suggestion that they work productively.

- **No treatment**: A fourth group of children was administered the full set of assessment procedures without any intervening exposure to the instructional material. This group provided a control for any possible effects of testing and concomitant classroom instruction.

### Posttreatment Assessment

The procedures used in the pretreatment phase of the study were readministered on the day following completion of the fourth session. This intermediate point was selected to gauge the effects of goal proximity on the development of skill, self-efficacy, and intrinsic interest within an identical length of time. Had children been tested after completing the entire program of study, the posttreatment changes would have been confounded by variations in the amount of time different children required to complete the self-instruction.

Children's mathematical self-efficacy was measured at the end of treatment and after the posttest of subtraction performance. The self-efficacy scores obtained at the end of treatment were used to gauge the value of self-efficacy judgment in predicting subsequent arithmetic performance. Since posttest performance can affect perceived efficacy, the measure of self-efficacy obtained following the arithmetic posttest was related to the subsequent measure of intrinsic interest.

Each of the 25 pairs of efficacy assessment items, which were the same as those used in the pretreatment assessment, corresponded in form and difficulty level to a subtraction problem in the performance test.

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

Children had to rely on generalizable perceptions of their mathematical capabilities in making their efficacy judgments.

A parallel form of the performance test used in the pretest was devised for the posttreatment assessment of mathematical competence. This eliminated any possible effects due to familiarity with problems. Both forms were administered in a counterbalanced order to a sample of 17 children who were not participants in the formal study. The alternate forms yielded highly comparable scores (r = .87).

Children's intrinsic interest in subtraction problems was measured in a separate session scheduled the day after the posttreatment assessment. The tester explained that she/he had another task the children could do. Their attention was then drawn to two stacks of 10 pages each. One stack contained 60 subtraction problems of varying levels of difficulty; the other stack contained rows of digit-symbol problems adapted from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (Wechsler, 1974). The latter task involved filling in rows of empty squares with symbols corresponding to the digits appearing above each square.

The tester stressed that the children should feel free to decide whether they wanted to work on one, or the other, or both tasks. It was further emphasized that it was up to them to decide how much time they wanted to spend on each activity. The children worked alone until 25 min. had elapsed. The number of subtraction problems the children solved under these permissive choice conditions constituted the measure of intrinsic interest.

All of the assessment procedures were administered individually by the same tester in both phases of the study. To control for any possible bias, the testers had no knowledge of the conditions to which the children had been assigned.

After the experiment was concluded, all children, including the controls, pursued self-directed instruction to completion under proximal subgoals to provide maximal benefits for all participants.

## Results

No significant sex differences were found on any of the measures at either the pretest or posttest assessments, since the sample was confined to children with gross arithmetic deficits. In the posttest assessment, children showed comparable gains in self-efficacy and arithmetic performance on generalization problems and on the types of items used in the treatment phase. Having mastered particular subtractive operations on simpler exemplars, children applied them accurately to more complex forms. The data were therefore pooled across sex and class of item for the primary analyses.

Analyses of variance were computed on the different sets of data, with phases of the experiment and treatment conditions representing the main factors. At the pretest phase, the groups did not differ on any of the measures. Significant intergroup differences obtained in the posttreatment phase were analyzed further, using the Newman-Keuls multiple-comparison method. Table 1 shows the significance levels of the treatment effects, the changes achieved by children within each condition, and comparisons between treatment conditions.

### Perceived Self-Efficacy

The strength of children's perceived mathematical efficacy at different phases of the experiment is presented graphically in Figure 1.

Analysis of these data shows the main effect of treatment, F(3, 36) = 10.13, p < .001, and the interaction between treatment and experimental phases, F(6, 72) = 5.96, p < .001, to be highly significant.

Intragroup comparisons of changes in strength of self-efficacy, evaluated by the t test for correlated means, yielded no significant differences for children in the control group (Table 1). Those who had the benefit of

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

Children oriented toward proximal subgoals substantially increased their perceived self-efficacy and exhibited even further gains following the performance posttest. Children oriented toward distal goals displayed a moderate increase in self-efficacy but a small decline after the posttest. Self-directed learning without goals produced a modest increase at a borderline level of significance.

In separate comparisons between treatments, the proximal group exceeded all others in strength of perceived self-efficacy, as measured both before and after the behavioral posttest (Table 1). Children in the distal condition also exceeded the controls in self-efficacy, but they did not differ significantly from those who set no goals for themselves. Children in the latter condition judged their mathematical efficacy more highly than did the controls after but not before the performance posttest.

## Mathematical Performance

Figure 1 presents the mean scores obtained on the subtraction performance test by children in the various conditions. The main effect of treatment was highly significant, F(3, 36) = 12.80, p < .001, as was the interaction between treatment and experimental phases, F(3, 36) = 12.55, p < .001.

Self-directed instruction promoted mastery of subtractive operations in all three groups, whereas the controls remained at a loss on how to subtract numbers from each other (Table 1). In pairwise comparisons, children who had employed proximal subgoals surpassed all the other groups in subtractive skills. Children who engaged in self-directed learning either with distal or no goals did not differ significantly from each other, but both groups outperformed the controls.

In the above measure, children received partial credit if they applied the appropriate subtractive operations but made a minor error in deriving or in recording the answer. The identical pattern of results is obtained on scores using a stringent criterion requiring perfect accuracy on all counts. In comparing the children's subtractive skills before and after treatment, all three groups that engaged in self-directed instruction achieved significant gains beyond the p < .001 level of significance; whereas the controls, who solved only 5% of the problems in pretest and only 8% in posttest, remained grossly deficient in this regard.

Contrasts between the means of the different treatment conditions show the children in the proximal condition to be much more skilled than those in the distal (p < .01), no-goals (p < .01), or control (p < .01), conditions. Children who pursued the self-learning with distal (p < .01) or no goals (p < .01) were also more skilled than the controls, but the former two groups did not differ from each other.

## Persistence

Children who gain high self-efficacy through skill acquisition solve problems readily and, therefore, need not spend much time on them. An aggregate measure of persistence spanning the entire range of difficulty is not too meaningful because long perseverence times on hard problems are offset by rapid solutions of less difficult ones. Changes in persistence were, therefore, analyzed separately for problems at two levels of difficulty: The difficult set of problems required two or more borrowing operations, whereas the easier set involved either no borrowing or, at most, only one smaller minuend.

Analysis of persistence on the easy arithmetic items revealed no differences except for the controls, who were significantly less persevering (-31%) when tested again. However, in the efforts expended on difficult arithmetic items, the proximal children were markedly more persistent after treatment than before (+90%), the distal (+22%) and the no-goals children (+39%) were moderately more persistent, whereas the controls slackened their efforts (-27%) in the post-test. This differential pattern of perseverence yielded a highly significant Treatment × Phases interaction, F(3, 36) = 5.67, p < .005. Analyses of intragroup changes presented in Table 1 show that the increased perseverence of the proximally self-motivated children and the diminished effort of the controls are highly significant. Multiple comparisons among groups in the posttest assessment disclose that children in each of the treatment conditions, although not differing from each other, were

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

The more self-instructional material the children mastered, the stronger was their sense of mathematical self-efficacy, r(28) = .42, p < .01. Performances that are readily achieved suggest a higher level of self-ability than do analogous attainments gained through slow, heavy labor. Consistent with this expectation, the faster the children completed each lesson, the more efficacious they judged themselves to be, r(28) = .32, p < .05. Standardized measures of mathematical competence, based on the Metropolitan Achievement Test, did not predict rate of skill acquisition or degree of self-efficacy enhancement.

Both instructional performance, r(28) = .33, p < .05, and strength of self-efficacy, r(38) = .42, p < .01, were moderately related to the children's facility in using subtractive operations. However, strength of self-efficacy was a significant predictor of perfect arithmetic accuracy for the total sample, r(38)= .49, p < .001, and for the self-instructed groups, r(28) = .40, p < .025, whereas past self-instructional performance was only marginally related to faultless post-test performance, r(28) = .25, p < .10.

Skill acquisition speeds problem solving. This factor attentuated the relationship between self-efficacy and persistence for the treated children who found most of the problems readily soluble and, hence, had no need to spend much time on them. The influence of perceived self-efficacy on perseverence is best revealed on problems that cannot be solved however hard one tries. Children who doubt their capabilities quit sooner than those who believe they can eventually master the task should they persevere. This condition obtains for the control children whose marked arithmetic deficiencies rendered most of the problems insoluble. For this group, the stronger the children's self-perceived efficacy, the longer they persevered, r(8) = .63, p = .025. For all children, high perseverence was accompanied by high performance attainments on the more difficult problems, r(38) = .51, p < .001. Even the easy problems were exceedingly difficult for the control children, and here too, persistence was related to performance success, r(8) = .61, p < .001.

The relationship of perceived self-efficacy to intrinsic interest can be analyzed in several ways. It may require at least moderately high self-efficacy to generate and sustain interest in an activity, but interest is not much affected by small variations above or below the threshold level. To test this threshold notion, interest scores were correlated with number of self-percepts of efficacy that matched or exceeded an efficacy strength of 40, which was previously shown to be the optimal criterion in the congruence analysis. The results disclose that the higher the level of self-efficacy at the end of the posttest, the greater the interest shown in arithmetic activities, r(38) = .27, p < .05.

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

Results show that variations in mean strength of self-efficacy covaried with interest in the control and the no-goals conditions, r(18) = .39, p < .05, but not in the goal-setting treatments. Although interest was positively related to self-percepts of efficacy derived from performance attainments in treatment, it was uncorrelated with the performance attainments themselves. However, the standardized measures of competence in mathematical subfunctions emerged as significant correlates. The more competent children were at mathematical computation, r(38) = .42, p < .01, and problem solving, r(38) = .58, p < .001, the more subtraction problems they completed in the free-choice situation.

## Discussion

Results of the present study confirm the influential role of proximal self-motivators in the cultivation of competence, self-percepts of efficacy, and intrinsic interest. Children who set themselves attainable subgoals progressed rapidly in self-directed learning, achieved substantial mastery of mathematical operations, and heightened their perceived self-efficacy and interest in activities that initially held little attraction for them.

Efforts to clarify how goal proximity operates in self-regulatory mechanisms ordinarily present difficulties because even though encouraged to set themselves distal goals, people are prone to convert them into more aidful proximal ones. They simply fractionate desired future accomplishments into attainable daily subgoals (Bandura & Simon, 1977). In the present experiment, children could not transform distal into proximal self-motivators because not knowing how to divide, they could not partition the entire instructional enterprise into equivalent subunits. Results of the combined studies attest to the motivating potential of proximal goals, whether they are suggested or spontaneously generated, or whether the self-sustained behavior is tractable or very difficult to produce.

Judgment of mathematical self-efficacy by children just beginning to understand the requisite cognitive skills is no simple matter. With very brief exposure to sample items, it is hard to discriminate among different levels of task difficulty. This is because the complexity of some of the subtractive operations is not instantly apparent from what is most readily observable. When complex operations are imbedded in seemingly easy problems, which is often the case, appearances can be quite misleading. In such situations, incongruities between perceived self-efficacy and action may stem from misperceptions of task demands as well as from faulty self-knowledge. Moreover, solving problems typically requires applying multiple operations. Even if they were readily recognizable, judgment of personal capabilities for a given type of task is complicated if some of the constituent operations are thoroughly mastered and others are only partially understood. Selective attention to mastered elements highlights competencies; whereas focus on what is less well understood highlights shortcomings. Even equal attentiveness to all aspects of the task will produce some variance in judgments of self-efficacy, depending on how much weight is given to the differentially mastered operations.

Given these complexities, it is not surprising that children sometimes overestimated their capabilities, especially on tasks that appeared deceptively simple. However, it is noteworthy that in addition to its other benefits, goal proximity fosters veridical self-knowledge of capabilities. Children who guided and judged their progress in terms of proximal subgoals were highly accurate in their self-appraisals. In contrast, skill development under conditions in which progress toward competence is somewhat ambiguous does not improve self-knowledge. Despite the fact that children in the distal and no-goal conditions acquired new information about mathematics and applied it repeatedly, the accurateness of their self-appraisals was no better than that of the controls, who did not have the benefit of substantial performance information for constructing their self-knowledge.

The above results are consistent with previous findings that judgments of self-efficacy are not simply reflectors of past performance (Bandura, 1977a, 1977b). Rather they reflect an inferential process in which the self-ability inferences drawn from one's performances vary, depending on how much weight is placed on personal and situational factors that can

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

Results of microanalyses of congruence between self-efficacy judgment and performance indicate that the optimal cutoff value of efficacy strength varies across activities, depending on the complexity and the variety of skills they require. Performances that draw on only a few skills reduce the likelihood of overestimating personal capabilities by overweighting a mastered subpart. Hence, lower efficacy strength values can be predictive of success (Bandura, 1977a). In activities that depend on diverse subskills, knowledge of some of them, especially the more directly observable ones, raises the level of assurance that one might be able to perform successfully. Consequently, somewhat higher cutoff values of efficacy strength become predictive of success.

Research on intrinsic interest has centered primarily on how extrinsic incentives affect high interest when it is already present rather than on how to develop it when it is lacking. It is the latter problem that presents major challenges, especially when avoidance of activities essential for self-development reflects antipathy arising from repeated failure rather than mere disinterest. The present findings lend support to the general thesis that skills cultivated through proximal standards of competency build interest in disvalued activities. When progress is gauged against distal goals, similar accomplishments may prove disappointing because of wide disparities between current performance and lofty future standards. Consequently, interest fails to develop, even though skills are being acquired in the process.

Perceived self-efficacy was accompanied by high-performance attainments and perseverence under conditions in which such a relationship would be expected to obtain. Regardless of conditions of treatment, persistency increased the likelihood of success. There was some evidence to indicate that faultless arithmetic performance was better predicted from self-efficacy than from behavioral attainments in treatment. However, caution should be exercised in judging causal contributions from correlations because some of the measures reflect continuously interactive processes rather than discrete sequential ones. Consider, for example, the question of directionality of influence in obtained relationships between treatment performance, posttreatment self-efficacy, and posttest performance. Self-efficacy judgments are unconfounded by future posttest performance, but it is highly unlikely that self-percepts of efficacy played no role whatsoever in performance attainments during the self-directed learning. Judgments of one's capabilities can affect rate of skill acquisition, and performance mastery, in turn, can boost self-efficacy in a mutually enhancing process. It is not as though self-efficacy affects future performances in the posttest but does not affect earlier performances in the treatment phase.

The causal contribution of perceived self-efficacy to performance is most clearly revealed in studies in which self-percepts of efficacy are developed solely through vicarious or cognitive means that entail no overt performance (Bandura & Adams, 1977; Bandura, Adams, & Beyer, 1977; Bandura, Adams, Hardy, & Howells, 1980; Bandura, Reese, & Adams, Note 1). Perceived self-efficacy, instated symbolically, predicts well the pattern of performance successes and failures on specific tasks.

A further issue addressed in this research concerns the relationship between perceived self-efficacy and intrinsic interest. It was mainly children in the proximally self-motivated condition, all of whom felt highly efficacious, who displayed the notable level of intrinsic interest. In contrast, children in the other conditions generally expressed self-doubts concerning their capabilities and showed little spontaneous interest in solving arithmetic problems. Regardless of treatment conditions, self-percepts of moderate to high strength were positively related to interest.

Intrinsic interest seems to covary most closely with the more long-standing indicants of actual or perceived competence, that is, the standardized measures of competence in mathematical subfunctions and perceived self-efficacy in groups whose preexisting self-percepts were either unaltered or changed only marginally. These findings raise the interesting possibility that some temporal lag exists between newly acquired self-efficacy and corresponding growth of interest.

in challenging activities is now well established across a wide range of behavioral domains (Bandura, 1981; Brown & Inouye, 1978; Weinberg, Gould, & Jackson, 1979; Schunk, 1981; Condiotte & Lichtenstein, in press). But it may require mastery experiences over a period of time before the self-efficacy derived from progressive successes creates strong interest in activities that were disvalued or even disliked. If, in fact, effects follow such a temporal course, then increased interest would emerge as a later rather than as an instant consequent of enhanced self-efficacy. Because of the theoretical import of the link between self-efficacy and interest, both the threshold and the temporal lag effects warrant systematic investigation.
