# Using chatbots to support student goal setting and social presence in fully online activities: learner engagement and perceptions

Khe Foon Hew, Weijiao Huang, Jiahui Du, Chengyuan Jia

## Abstract

Although fully online learning is now the 'new normal' in many parts of the world, its implementation is often beset by challenges such as the lack of student self-regulation, and the sense of isolation. In this paper, we explored the use of chatbots to support student goal setting (Study 1) and social presence (Study 2) in online activities. In Study 1, participants in a fully online course were invited to complete a goal setting activity prior to attending class via a goal-setting chatbot. The chatbot engaged participants with five questions developed based on the SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely) goal setting framework. In Study 2, English-as-Foreign-Language participants in a fully online course were tasked to complete listening practices. The learning buddy chatbot was designed based on the social presence framework (interpersonal communication, open communication, cohesive communication) to guide students through listening exercises. In both Study 1 and 2, we evaluated participants' behavioral engagement by measuring their conversation records with the chatbots, as well as participants' perceived usefulness and ease of use of the chatbots. We also gathered in-depth interview data concerning the participants' perceptions of interacting with the chatbots. Overall, our findings found positive learner experiences with both chatbots with regard to the chatbots' perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. We also provided suggestions for instructors to apply chatbots in teaching and learning.

## Introduction

Although fully online learning has been in existence since the late 1980s, many educators have eschewed using it. Despite the advantages of fully online courses such as convenience and cost benefit to students, and economies of scale benefit to institutions, more often than not, fully online courses suffer mostly from a lack of student engagement (Starr-Glass, 2020). Disengagement has been conceptualised as students not participating in or withdrawing from the course activities (Chipchase et al., 2017). The dropout rates in online higher education remain a pressing and persistent problem (Xavier & Meneses, 2020). It is not surprising that prior to the health crisis, many educators and students were not interested to adopt fully online courses in their curricula. As many as 91% of 11,141 faculty members from more than 130 U.S. institutions do not wish to teach in a fully online environment (Pomerantz & Brooks, 2017). As many as 70% of more than 40,000 students across 118 American preferred mostly or completely face-to-face learning (Gierdowski, 2019).

The reservation of using fully online learning, however, changed when the pandemic struck. Fully online learning has dramatically moved from the margins to the mainstream of education. Even when the current pandemic ends, there is a critical need for institutions to plan for possible future school closures due to new pandemics or other disasters. Fully online learning is now no longer an option but an absolute necessity in order to alleviate the disruptions caused by any future crisis. It is therefore important for us to explore ways to alleviate student disengagement in fully online learning.

Research on student disengagement in online courses has revealed several factors that can lead to student disengagement—this includes the lack of student self-regulation (Barrot et al., 2021; Pedrotti & Nistor, 2019), and the sense of isolation (Barrot et al., 2021; Chametzky, 2021). In this study, we aimed to explore the innovative use of chatbots to enhance students' online learning engagement in two exploratory case studies, which involved two classes of students enrolled in two fully online courses: an adult education course with 29 postgraduate students (Study

to create new patterns to extend rule-based chatbots' knowledge bases or delete patterns to solve bugs. So far, commercial industries prefer to use rule-based chatbots, as the rule-based chatbots can achieve higher accuracy in responding to users' inputs than self-learnable chatbots which can learn from users' inputs but are not yet well-developed (Thorat & Jadhav, 2020).

We developed the goal-setting chatbot and the learning buddy chatbot using Google Dialogflow, a visual development tool that requires no prior computer programming knowledge. A useful chatbot system should be always available and provide instant responses in a natural way through conversational interfaces (Smutny & Schreiberova, 2020). Students in this study can easily access to the two chatbots by clicking on the course page in the Moodle Learning Management System without the limitation of time, location, and devices. After entering the chatbot interface, students can interact with the chatbot with the same way as messaging a friend.

This study offers the following contributions:

- First, we explored the use of chatbots in two fully online learning activities to foster students' online engagement. As the COVID-19 pandemic remains around the world, many institutions continue adopting fully online learning as the main teaching approach. This study provided practical knowledge, and empirical evidence to widen teachers' choice of appropriate instructional tool to enhance students' online engagement.

- Second, one of the novelties of this study is to design educational chatbots based on theoretical frameworks, rather than from a mere technological perspective. We employed two theoretical frameworks (i.e., SMART goal setting framework and Social Presence framework) to drive the design of chatbot–student conversations. Despite the popularity of using chatbots in education, the lack of teaching and learning objectives in designing educational chatbots remains a problem. So far, the chatbot development is primarily driven by technology rather than a clear pedagogical focus on supporting students outcomes (Wollny et al., 2021).

- Third, we provided a thick description of the development of two chatbots to encourage replication by other researchers and educators who have no computer programming experience.

The following research questions (RQ) guided this study:

1. What are the effects of the goal-setting chatbot and the learning buddy chatbot on students' behavioral engagement in online learning?
2. What are students' perceived usefulness and ease of use of the two chatbots?
3. What are students' perceptions of goal-setting process and social presence supported by the chatbots?
4. What are students' suggestions for improving the design of educational chatbots?

## Theoretical background

### Self-regulated learning: importance of goal setting

During online learning activities, students are often given more autonomy over their learning process. The "when" and "where" of students' working on the online contents is often up to the students themselves to decide which significantly increases the level of student self-regulation (Hartley & Bendixen, 2001). According to Zimmerman (2013), self-regulation theory contains three phases (forethought, performance, self-reflection), with each phase representing a process that occurs before learning, during learning and after the learning effort. The forethought phase refers to the stage where students prepare for learning. Goal setting is a key element in this phase which refers to students deciding on the intended outcomes of a learning effort (Schwarzenberg & Navon, 2020). The performance phase refers to use of strategies such as self-monitoring to keep track of one's performance during learning. The self-reflection phase refers to processes that occur after learning where students reflect on their learning experience and outcomes. These self-reflections can influence subsequent forethought processes (Zimmerman, 2013).

Self-regulated students are more likely to perform better in their learning (Lachmann & Kiefel, 2012). However, many online students lack self-regulation skills and are not ready for conducting autonomous learning (

## Using chatbots to support student goal setting and social presence

For example, questions such as "what are your goals when learning from this video" may not help students set effective goals that are measurable and achievable. In this study, we chose the SMART goal framework (Doran, 1981). The SMART framework contains five key elements of writing goals: specific, measurable, achievable or assignable, realistic, and time-related. The SMART method is commonly considered as the standard for developing effective, measurable goals and is widely used for developing program goals and objectives (Bjerke & Renger, 2017). In this study, the goal setting chatbot would engage participants at the start of the course with five questions developed based on the SMART method (see the Study 1 section for more detail).

### Sense of isolation: facilitating social presence

Besides the lack of self-regulation skills, online students also feel a sense of isolation (Bączek et al., 2021; Chametzky, 2021) due to the lack of interactions among the participants in the online space (Wut & Xu, 2021). For example, a student may pose a question online, or ask for help regarding a lesson activity but fail to get a response from other people. Even though recent video-conferencing technologies such as Zoom can enable online conversation that mimics real-time face-to-face conversation, 33% of 400 respondents stated that they were less willing to respond to questions during Zoom sessions compared with traditional in-person lessons (Cavinato et al., 2021).

One way to alleviate isolation during online activities is to facilitate a sense of social presence. A heightened level of social presence can increase the frequency of online interaction (Tu & McIsaac, 2002). Social presence can be defined as "the ability of participants to project themselves socially and emotionally, as real people" (Garrison et al., 1999, p. 94). Previous studies have suggested that social presence can reduce stress and the sense of loneliness (Whiteside et al., 2014), and enhance student satisfaction with the course (Richardson et al., 2017). It is important to note that social presence does not mean supporting engagement simply for social purposes (Garrison, 2011). Instead, social presence in an educational setting means creating a climate that supports open and cohesive communication so that participants feel comfortable to ask questions without the fear of hurting somebody's feelings and damaging a relationship (Garrison, 2011).

In the present study, we explored the use of a chatbot to facilitate a sense of social presence. According to social response theory (Nass & Moon, 2000), human-computer interactions are basically social where humans have the innate tendency to perceive computers as social beings, even when they know that machines do not have feelings or intentions. By interacting with an anthropomorphized machine, a user may perceive a sense of social presence (Adam et al., 2021).

Unlike a human being, a chatbot is available online 24/7 for participants who wish to converse with it. To help us design the chatbot, we refer to the specific categories of social presence described by Garrison (2011): interpersonal communication, open communication, and cohesive communication. Interpersonal communication refers to messages that create a sense of belonging with other people such as through affective expressions (e.g., emoticons, emojis). Open communication refers to messages that explicitly recognize other people through quoting from other participants' messages, agreeing with, and expressing appreciation. Cohesive communication aims to build a sense of community through the use of phatics messages (commonly known as small talk, e.g., "nice morning today!"), vocatives (e.g., addressing participants by name), salutations, and inclusive pronouns such as "we". In this way, this study examined and tested the usefulness of the interpersonal, open and cohesive strategies in the context of chatbot communication to induce social presence.

### Overview of chatbots

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

## Using Chatbots to Support Student Goal Setting and Social Learning

In general, chatbots can be developed either using programming languages such as Python or a chatbot development platform (Nayyar, 2019). In the case of the latter, a developer can use a chatbot visual flow builder to develop a chatbot without any coding. Examples of some common chatbot visual flow builders include IBM Watson Assistant system, and Google Dialogflow. Both IBM Watson and Dialogflow are AI-powered systems that uses machine learning and natural language to facilitate the development of chatbots (Zuckerman, 2020).

In this study, we use Google Dialogflow platform to build our chatbot activities. A typical chatbot dialog in Dialogflow consists of three components: intents, entities, and the responses. Intents refer to users' possible question or responses. Entities are keywords or synonyms which help the chatbots to recognize a user's localize words. For example, when a user asks the questions "What is experiential learning?" or "Can you explain the definition of experiential learning?", these two sentences will be recognized as one same question asking for the definition of experiential learning by searching out intent definition and entity experiential_learning. A response would be the answer provided by the chatbot.

A developer can test the accuracy of a chatbot by inputting as many questions as possible. A chatbot can be trained if its output is wrong. Developers can manually classify the confused inputs into correct intents; meanwhile the chatbot knowledge base will be updated and enriched automatically. With more and more data from users stored into the chatbot knowledge base, a better intelligent chatbot will be produced.

### The Design and Development of Two Chatbots

#### Study 1: The Goal-Setting Chatbot

To recall, we focused on the goal-setting process in this study because clear goals are essential for student self-regulation, and successful completion of courses (Handoko et al., 2019). The goal-setting chatbot helped students set personal learning goals concerning the course they attended. Students were required to interact with the goal-setting chatbot on Moodle webpage before coming to the first class. The goal-setting chatbot engaged students with five goal-setting questions based on SMART framework (Table 1). We used the Google Dialogflow platform to build the chatbot. According to Azran (2019), Dialogflow provides the easiest and quickest way to create a custom conversational bot.

For each question, potential options were offered to inspire the directions of students' self-regulated learning goals and expectations of the course. Options can boost a chatbot's engagement with a user because it reduces the potential for misunderstandings between the chatbot and the user (LiveChat, 2022). Additionally, providing students with options to respond generally yield higher response rate than open-ended questions (Reja et al., 2003). The options listed by the chatbot were developed in consultation with the course teacher who had in-depth knowledge of the general expectations or concerns faced by students based on his previous experience teaching the course over many years.

For example, before students attended the first lesson, the chatbot asked students "could you tell me what you want to gain most from this course?" followed by three options (Fig. 2). The three options represented three possible learning goals. All students were given the opportunity to express their expectations by choosing the options as their learning goals. Student in Fig. 2 replied to the chatbot with "I may choose 2nd one", which means this student chose option B. Based on the student's answer to each question, the goal-setting chatbot would provide relevant recommendations that suit each student's preference. Hence, in Fig. 2, the goal-setting chatbot responded to the student with "I see … I believe you can do better than this!" According to students' responses in the interviews and open-ended surveys, none of the students mentioned that they felt lost or overwhelmed. Instead, many students indicated that this activity helped them clarified learning goals and they hoped to get more recommendations during the process. Together with the recommendations after each choice, students can have

| SMART Rules | Questions in Chatbot | Choice examples | Recommendation examples |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| Specific | Why do you take this course? | I'll teach adults | Good to know! Keep the adult learning strategies introduced in this course in mind and reflect them on your own experience |
| Measurable | May I know what grade level you want to get in this course? | Grade A, B, or C? | Please refer to the recommendations and seek for extra help whenever you feel unconfident |
| Attainable | Can you foresee any difficulties you may have while pursuing your learning goal in this course? | I might have difficulties in understanding or applying the adult learning strategies appropriately in my own study | Try to engage more in the pre and in-class activities/cases. Those stories and scenarios will help you better understand the concept and relate to real-life situations |
| Relevant | Could you tell me what you want to gain most from this course? | Knowledge of adult learning strategies and how to apply them in my own study | Then I will advise you to look for more supplemental readings on the strategies that you find appropriate for your learning |
| Timely | May I know when you plan to complete all the six written assignments? | I might not be able to complete it in time | Then I would like you to learn about all the assignments and plan ahead. You will be able to complete them! |

Entities, including "level A", "A−", and "A+" were included. Recommendations for self-regulated learning strategies were fed into the responses database.

To minimise students' off-topic replies, we labelled three potential options (A, B, or C) for each question posed. Figure 3 shows the flowchart for designing the goal-setting chatbot. The goal-setting chatbot was tested by the instructor and the developer before it was launched on Moodle (Figure 4).

## Study 2: The Learning Buddy Chatbot

Out-of-class practice is essential to students' improvement in foreign language learning due to the insufficient time in classroom (García Botero et al., 2019; Kennedy & Levy, 2009). However, students' engagement in the out-of-class practice is relatively low because they need more opportunities to interact with instructor and peer students to alleviate the sense of isolation while learning (Jia & Hew, 2022). Social presence can be a solution, because it has been shown to reduce stress and the sense of loneliness (Whiteside et al., 2014).

In out-of-class online learning, students usually complete online learning activities (e.g., watching videos and reading materials) by themselves before having a synchronous online meeting with teachers and classmates (Jia et al., 2022). To facilitate a sense of social presence in the out-of-class online learning, a social presence chatbot was created to act as a learning buddy, who guided students through the daily EFL listening practice. Students were provided with daily listening practices, in the form of dictation exercises. A total of 10 sessions were administered. Daily tasks were estimated to be completed in 10 min.

While students interacted with the chatbot on Moodle course webpage, the chatbot guided the students to complete listening tasks, provided immediate feedback, and employed specific communication strategies to project social presence into its interaction with participants. We used Google Dialogflow to build the chatbot conversation. The chatbot was integrated into Moodle via embedded code and presented in a format of activity page. Once students clicked that activity page, the learning buddy chatbot would pop up and start conversation with students (Figure 5).

The design of the learning buddy chatbot was underpinned by the specific communication strategies of social presence described by Garrison (2011) (Table 2). Interpersonal communication was presented with the

## Methods

### Participants and context

Study 1 involved 29 postgraduate students (26 females, 3 males) who enrolled in a fully online course at a large public university in Asia. Study 2 involved 38 second-year undergraduate students (29 female, 9 male) of a fully online EFL listening course also at a public university in Asia. Ethical approval to conduct the two studies was granted by the university's Institutional Review Board. We used purposeful sampling to select the courses in Study 1 and Study 2. Purposeful sampling is widely used in qualitative research to identify information-rich cases related to the phenomenon of interest (Palinkas et al., 2015). The "phenomenon of interest" refers to the use of chatbots in fully online classes. We chose these fully online classes because the instructors of the two courses were interested to use chatbots in their lessons. The researchers worked closely with the instructor of the course in Study 1, and the instructor in Study 2 to develop the chatbots.

### Data collection and analysis

To address the first research question "what are the effects of the goal-setting chatbot and the learning buddy chatbot on students' behavioral engagement in online learning", we evaluated students' behavioral engagement by measuring their conversation records with the goal-setting chatbot and the learning buddy chatbot (utterance turn, session length, goal completion rate). Utterance turn refers to the number of back-and-forth exchange between a chatbot and a user (Yao, 2016). Session length is the amount of time that elapses between the moment a user starts to converse with a chatbot and the moment they end the conversation (Mead, 2019). The goal completion rate in this study would be the number of times the chatbot was successful in helping students complete the learning tasks.

To evaluate students' perceived usefulness and ease of use of the chatbots, a five-point scale questionnaire, ranging from 1 (i.e., strongly disagree) to 5 (i.e., strongly agree), was used (adapted from Davis, 1989, p. 340). Perceived ease of use can be defined as "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would be free of effort" (Davis, 1989, p. 320). There were four items for perceived usefulness. The sample items were "Using the chatbot made it easier to complete my goal setting process" (for study 1) and "Using the chatbot made it easier to complete my daily listening practices" (for study 2). Perceived usefulness is "the degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance" (Davis, 1989, p. 320). The scale of perceived ease of use also included 4 items. The sample item was "I found it is easy to use the chatbot to communicate."

## Students' perceptions of goal setting supported by chatbot

Altogether 18 students voluntarily participated in our interview, and they were asked to describe in what ways they believed the chatbot helped them in their goal setting process. We employed a grounded approach to analyze students' interview data, from which students' responses could be categorized into different themes inductively. One researcher analyzed all the students' data and generated three main themes. To ensure the reliability of the data analysis, the second researcher randomly coded 25% interview data. The inter-coder agreement was 90%. The disagreement was resolved by a discussion between the two researchers. Three main themes emerged from the study (Table 5).

### a) Clarify the learning goals

Students found the conversation with chatbot useful in the way that it helped them clarify the learning goals. Students' perceptions can be interpreted from two aspects. First, some students were not sure about what the course would be like when they first came. In this case, setting specific and relevant goals can be extremely tough for students due to the lack of information toward future learning process. The guiding questions proposed in chatbot displayed in the format of multiple choice questions, which gave students some hints of what could be the possible paths they might follow toward completing the learning activities. For example, the "Relevant" question asked students to indicate what they want to gain most from this course. Considering that students can barely describe what they want without knowing what they could possibly gain from the course, we provided different options for students to choose so that they could perceive the potential direction for the future learning in this course:

> "I think it's an engaging experience. I enjoy doing it. The chatbot did well in supporting students and pointing the clear direction for their learning." (Student O)

Second, some students indicated that they had some rough goals in their mind, but those goals were not clear enough for them to follow. In this case, the goal-setting chatbot enabled students to specify their plans and expectations by answering the five guiding questions based on the SMART framework, which allowed students to clearly

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

## Using chatbots to support student goal setting and social learning

### Student Learning Experience

Students indicated that the goal setting strategies they learned could benefit both their current course and future learning:

> "It gives me the idea of how to use these strategies, for example, I need to set a goal before I start to learn, and I need to know what to do for each week, how to learn. And I think I can apply these strategies in my future learning." (Student E)

### Raise Awareness

SRL could be easily ignored as it mainly relates to learning strategies rather than learning contents. Many students are not aware of the importance of adopting various SRL strategies according to different learning phases. This chatbot activity aims to address the importance of setting effective learning goals, which many students skip in their actual learning process. After completing this chatbot activity, many students indicated increased awareness:

> "After doing this activity, I became aware of setting goals and monitoring my progress during the learning process." (Student F)

Some students mentioned that the chatbot questions inspired them to think about their course goals:

> "The conversations and questions raised by the chatbot inspire me to think. For students like me who might not have any goals or expectations toward the course when I first come, it provides a good chance for me to think about what I really want." (Student J)

### Students' Suggestions to Improve the Chatbot

An open-ended survey explored students' suggestions for improving the goal-setting chatbot. Four directions were identified:

- Richer recommendation: 7 students suggested providing more "customized recommendation" (Student O)
- More intelligence: Students wanted faster responses and Siri-like chat capabilities
- More interactive function: Adding "emojis in the sentences" to enhance interaction
- Long-term use: 2 students expressed willingness to continue using the chatbot

### Study 2: The Learning Buddy Chatbot

#### Behavioral Engagement

Students (n = 38) completed listening practices with the learning buddy chatbot during out-of-class learning. During the 2-week intervention, students averaged 17 utterance turns (M = 17.06) per day, SD = 6.58. Average conversational duration was about 7 minutes (M = 6.84, SD = 6.08). Students with 9 turns completed one compulsory listening activity, while those with 30 turns participated in optional activities. Goal completion rate was 92%.

#### Perceived Usefulness and Ease of Use

All participants (n = 38) completed the questionnaire. Cronbach's alpha for perceived usefulness and ease of use were 0.874 and 0.873 respectively.

## Using chatbots to support student goal setting and social presence

## Student Perceptions of Chatbot Usefulness and Ease of Use

Students' perceived usefulness (M = 4.15, SD = 0.70) of the learning buddy chatbot was higher than their perceived ease of use (M = 3.68, SD = 1.19). Students reported that the learning buddy chatbot enabled them to learn EFL listening materials and helped them comprehend the listening practices. Students perceived that the learning buddy chatbot is easy to communicate with. The second item of the perceived ease of use scale showed the lowest average mean of 3.15 (SD = 1.11). Students reported that unstable internet connection caused delayed feedback from the chatbot as a possible reason. However, when encountering technical errors, students perceived that the chatbot could still easily recover.

## Students' Perception of Social Presence Supported by Chatbot

Individual interviews were conducted with 11 volunteer students to explore their perception of social presence while learning with the chatbot in EFL listening practices. Using Garrison's social presence framework (2011), the coding framework was constructed with three broad categories: interpersonal communication, open communication, and cohesive communication (see Table 2). After initial coding, a second researcher coded 25% of randomly selected data, achieving 96% interrater reliability. The results are presented in Table 8.

### Interpersonal Communication

The most commonly reported category was interpersonal communication (n = 9). All nine students liked the chatbot's emojis, as they helped foster affective expression. Students reported that emojis "made the conversation more vivid" (Student 3), helped increase intimacy between students and chatbot (Student 2), and created a feeling "as if they were learning with a real buddy" (Student 4). However, Student 1 noted this positive feeling diminished as novelty wore off.

### Open Communication

Open communication was another commonly cited category (n = 7). Students reported that reading other students' messages about learning difficulties relieved their stress. The chatbot provided anonymous learning journals by quoting previous students' messages about difficulties and frustration. Participants found that "reading others' difficulties helped reduce their pressure, because they learned to know they were not alone as a frustrating learner" (Student 5).

Students appreciated learning through conversation, as the chatbot's feedback guided them step by step. Student 5 noted:

> "I preferred learning with the chatbot to the conventional learning approach, because I enjoyed learning through conversation and interaction. It gave me timely feedback at every step of learning, rather than only receiving the feedback in the end conventionally."

Words of appreciation, compliment, and encouragement from the chatbot were also reported as enjoyable and helpful. Student 3 typically responded:

> "When the chatbot congratulated me on my performance, I felt a sense of accomplishment. It was not easy to persist in the practice, so I found this compliment helpful."

### Cohesive Communication

Two students mentioned that the chatbot's use of their names increased intimacy and contributed to cohesive communication. For example, "referring my names made me feel closer to the bot" (Student 5), which made the interaction "more vivid and interesting" (Student 10).

## Students' Suggestions to Improve the Chatbot

An open-ended survey was administered to explore students' suggestions for improving the learning buddy chatbot. Responses were analyzed using a grounded approach, revealing four major themes concerning students' suggestions.

## Using chatbots to support student goal setting and social presence

## Findings on Chatbot Improvement Suggestions

Students identified four main suggestions for chatbot improvement:
- More fluency
- Richer content
- Less repetition
- More intelligence

The most commonly reported theme was the need for more fluent interaction with the learning buddy chatbot (n = 9). For example, Student 28 reported that chatbot lag affected their learning experience. This delay was likely due to unstable internet connections and video loading times.

Five students indicated they expected more varied responses from the chatbot. Since students completed tasks daily for 2 weeks, they could predict the chatbot's responses in the latter half of the practice, making interactions less engaging over time despite initial interest.

Five students mentioned that the chatbot's guidance and responses were sometimes repetitive and wordy. They preferred more concise interaction, especially after becoming familiar with the practice. Three students suggested the learning buddy chatbot could be more intelligent by better understanding their answers and providing more personalized feedback.

## Discussion

We developed and tested chatbots to support student goal setting (Study 1) and social presence (Study 2) in online activities. Goal-setting was chosen as it is essential for student self-regulation by defining acceptable performance levels. Social presence helps reduce online isolation.

### Students' behavioral engagement with the chatbots

Analysis of student-chatbot conversations showed average session lengths of 4 and 7 minutes respectively. While ideal session length varies by context, longer sessions generally indicate better engagement. Both chatbots achieved high goal completion rates (100% for goal-setting, 92% for learning buddy).

The learning buddy chatbot had higher average utterance turns (M = 17.06) compared to the goal-setting chatbot (M = 7.97). Students in Study 2 completed required EFL listening practices within 9 turns but continued exploring optional activities. This increased engagement was likely due to the learning buddy chatbot's use of social presence indicators (e.g., affective expression, expressing appreciation and agreement).

### Students' learning experience with the chatbots

Students reported positive experiences regarding both chatbots' perceived usefulness and ease of use. These factors directly impact intentions to use information systems. The high perceived usefulness may be attributed to teacher involvement in designing chatbot content based on learning objectives.

## Using chatbots to support student goal setting and social presence

Students interacted with chatbots like texting with friends when setting learning goals and accomplishing listening tasks. Based on multimedia learning principles (Mayer, 2017), individuals learn better when content is presented conversationally. While teachers have limited office hours, chatbots offer instant availability. The interaction between students and chatbots can help engage students during online learning. Hence, we suggest teachers consider using chatbots as virtual learning partners when teachers are unavailable.

## Students perceptions of goal-setting and social presence supported by chatbots

In Study 1, we examined how a chatbot can help students in their goal setting process. Seven students indicated this activity helped clarify their learning goals by pointing out direction and visualizing roughly outlined goals. This finding shows chatbots can effectively provide guidance, addressing a major frustration students encounter during SRL (Wong et al., 2019). Students indicated the goal setting activity effectively raised awareness and inspired thinking about their true wants. This awareness of goal setting strategies is important for developing better self-regulated learners (Handoko et al., 2019).

In Study 2, we examined how a chatbot can guide students through English listening exercises by providing immediate feedback and employing specific communication strategies to project social presence. Our findings suggest chatbots can be capitalized to induce social presence perceptions in online interactions. When designing chatbot messages, instructors can focus on projecting social presence using Garrison's interpersonal, open, and cohesive communication strategies. Chatbots can be programmed to:
- Express affective messages using emojis
- Actively ask questions or give comments rather than waiting for participants
- Express agreement and show appreciation
- Address participants by name
- Use collective pronouns to foster interconnectedness

## Implications for future educational chatbot design

Based on participant responses about needed improvements, we synthesized recommendations into two major themes: technological limitations and non-technological problems.

The most common reported technological limitation was the chatbot's limited artificial intelligence. Students mentioned chatbots could be more intelligent by better understanding answers and offering more personalized responses. This aligns with recent reviews showing limited intelligence as the most frequently reported challenge in chatbot use (Huang et al., 2022).

Students in both studies reported limited responses as a disadvantage. Study 1 participants expected more recommendation tips beyond three pre-defined options. This challenge was more obvious in Study 2, where longer interaction periods made chatbot answers predictable and less interesting.

Although chatbots are programmed with common questions, anticipating every possible question is impossible. As a stop-gap measure while building more intelligent systems, educators should design chatbots to respond with fallback messages expressing uncertainty and suggesting alternatives (Følstad & Taylor, 2020).

Study 2 students considered repetitive and wordy conversation as another demerit, despite initially enjoying detailed guidance. For long-term chatbot use, adding variety sustains learning interest (Keller, 1987). Basic introduction or guidance can fade out as students become familiar with activities.

## Limitations

Several limitations warrant caution when interpreting findings:
- Relatively small sample sizes in both studies
- Majority of participants were female Asian students
- Future research should implement chatbots with larger, more diverse samples across other courses
- Additional metrics like chatbot fallback rate should be measured

## Using chatbots to support student goal setting and social learning

The magnitude at which universities and schools around the world have unanimously embraced online learning in past 2 years is truly unprecedented. Yet, despite the significant interest in online learning, the lack of student engagement in online activities remains a persistent problem. Research on student disengagement in online learning activities has revealed several factors that can lead to student disengagement, notably the lack of student self-regulation, and the sense of isolation.

This study advances the online learning literature by illustrating the potential of chatbots to help fully online students set personal learning goals through five questions based on the SMART goal setting framework, and to guide students through listening exercises by providing immediate feedback, and employing specific communication strategies to project social presence into its interaction with participants. We evaluated students' behavioral engagement, perceived usefulness and ease of use of the chatbots, perceptions of learning with chatbots, and suggestions for educational chatbot design. The findings indicated students' positive learning experience with the goal-setting chatbot and the learning buddy chatbot, which suggested the effectiveness of employing theoretical frameworks in designing chatbots for teaching and learning. It is hoped the findings and suggestions can help teachers and researchers to design chatbot-supported learning activities and facilitate students' online learning.
