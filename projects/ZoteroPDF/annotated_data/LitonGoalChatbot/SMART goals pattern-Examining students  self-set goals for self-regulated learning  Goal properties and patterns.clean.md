Task-specific goals play a critical role in self-regulated learning, yet little research has examined students' self-set goals for authentic study sessions. We propose high-quality goals that are useful for guiding task engagement and evaluating progress are specific about (a) time, (b) actions, (c) standards, and (d) content. In Study 1, we examined characteristics of students' self-set goals. Five categories were created to describe students' goals relative to the features of a high-quality goal. Students rarely included specific information regarding actions, standards, or content. In Study 2, we examined patterns of change in quality of self-set goals across a semester in which students were in a learning-to-learn course. Improvements in goal quality were either inconsistent or non-existent. Implications of vague goals for regulating learning are discussed.

## Introduction

Expectations for undergraduate-level university courses are unique compared to earlier stages of learning. Students often (a) receive little guidance from their instructors, (b) are expected to spend a large portion of time independently studying outside of class, and (c) are rarely given external feedback on their studying. Instead, students must wait until after they have submitted work or written an exam to receive feedback, at which point it is often too late for students to adjust their approach. Without proper intervention, students may struggle to develop strategies to tackle large academic tasks with minimal instruction (Tinto 2005; Yorke and Longden 2004). Learning to productively self-regulate learning offers promise for students making this transition.

Self-regulated learners strategically approach their academic tasks and make changes to their studying before it is too late (Winne and Hadwin 1998). Self-regulated learners direct, monitor, and adapt their cognition, behaviour, and motivation (Winne and Hadwin 1998; Zimmerman 1989, 2000). Research consistently suggests that self-regulated learning (SRL) is positively related to academic performance (Cleary and Chen 2009; Zimmerman and Martinez-Pons 1986). Winne and Hadwin (2008) describe the two main features of SRL as (a) recognizing when there is a discrepancy between the current state and the goal state, and (b) taking action to change that discrepancy. From this perspective, students' goals are a critical focal point of the regulatory process yet little research focuses specifically on students' self-set goals. Thus the overarching purpose of this study is to examine goals set by university students for authentic university study sessions and how those goals change over time.

## Goals for Self-Regulated Learning: Properties and Development

## Effective Goals for Self-Regulated Learning

While broader long-term academic goals are important (e.g. Acee et al. 2012), effective goals for regulation should focus on a single study session. A study session refers to any block of time during which students engage in university tasks, including lecture learning, exam preparation, paper writing, chapter reading, or group project collaboration. Consistent with Winne and Hadwin's (1998, 2008) model of SRL, we focus on micro-level goals students use to evaluate the effectiveness of a given study session.

Using this model and literature primarily from organizational research, we identified four key properties of goals that can guide metacognitive monitoring and evaluation during studying: timeframe, action, standard, and content (TASC). Table 1 provides an example of developing a vague study goal into a more specific goal with all TASC properties.

### Key Properties of Effective Goals

#### Timeframe
A timeframe helps to:
- Break down large multi-session goals into single-session achievements
- Create opportunities for actively monitoring progress during studying

Seijts and Latham (2001) found that breaking down distal outcomes into short-term goals was associated with increased strategy use. When timeframes are specified, they generate check-in points to monitor progress, recognize problems, and regulate (Zimmerman 2008), particularly when committed to specific times and dates (Latham and Seijts 1999).

#### Action
Effective learning goals should include specific actions that define cognitive processes for learning. Specific cognitive actions (identify, evaluate, apply) provide a platform for choosing appropriate strategies. Cognitive-oriented learning goals focus attention on process completion and strategy use rather than outcome (Mone and Shalley 1995; Winters and Latham 1996).

#### Standard
Effective goals should articulate concrete standards for self-evaluation. Specifying degree, amount, or standard helps judge progress and identify opportunities for strategic regulation. Research shows setting specific performance standards improves outcomes (Locke and Latham 2002).

#### Content
Specifying content to be learned focuses attention on learning substance rather than task completion. Clear content guides learners to concentrate on relevant material and choose appropriate actions.

Table 1. Example of development of specific TASC goals.

| Element of goal development | Example |
|----------------------------|----------|
| Vague goal | Study for psychology |
| Specific time | On Monday, from 1 to 2pm, study for psychology |
| Specific content | On Monday, from 1 to 2pm, study working and long-term memory |
| Specific action | On Monday, from 1 to 2pm, compare working and long-term memory |
| Specific standard | On Monday, from 1 to 2pm, complete a chart comparing working and long-term memory without using my notes |

## Overview of Present Studies

Two studies were conducted to answer:
1. What are the characteristics of students' self-set studying goals?
2. What are the patterns in students' self-set goal quality over a semester in a learning-to-learn course?

Study 1 aimed to classify and describe students' goal-setting types to:
- Gain insight into study planning
- Identify what students evaluate during studying
- Design interventions

## Instructional Context

Learning Strategies for University Success is a first-year, credit-bearing, semester-long course designed to help students become productive self-regulated learners. This is an elective course, taken by students from a variety of disciplines and incoming levels of academic achievement. The course is anchored in SRL theory and research, guided by Winne and Hadwin's (1998, 2008) model of SRL. Each week, a class-wide lecture introduces students to a different SRL topic, and then a small-group lab guides students in applying the concepts to their learning in concurrent university courses.

The samples for the studies presented here were drawn from two semesters (Spring 2008 and Spring 2010) of the course. Within the first three to four weeks of the semester, students learned about the role of goals in SRL and were taught how to set specific, measurable, action-oriented, realistic, and timely (SMART) goals. Students were also assigned a lab activity in which they practiced writing multiple goals for the upcoming week. SMART goals were used because (a) the TASC framework had not yet been developed and (b) the SMART acronym is fairly prevalent and well-known. Although there are similarities between TASC and SMART criteria, we use the TASC criteria to analyse the quality of goals in this study as it is explicitly based in theories of SRL (e.g. Winne and Hadwin 1998) and, to our knowledge, there is little empirical literature on SMART goals.

## Study 1

### Method

#### Participants

Participants were 43 students (20 females; 23 males) enrolled in Learning Strategies. Students were from a variety of academic disciplines and ranged from their first to fourth year of university study with a mean age of 19.7 years (SD = 2.8). The 43 participants set a total of 348 goals across 11 weeks; a subset of 189 goals (53%) was randomly chosen for analysis, with an average of 4.4 goals per participant.

#### Measures and Procedure

Students completed an online reflection each week at the beginning of lab as a tool to encourage a weekly SRL cycle. Reflections consisted of two sections: (a) the planning section, where students were prompted to set a studying goal for the upcoming week; and (b) the reflecting section, where students reflected on their goal attainment from the previous week and evaluated what went well and how they could improve their goal striving. For the purposes of this study, we examined students' responses to one item: 'State one goal you have for your studying/learning in the upcoming week.' Students were not explicitly asked to set cognitive, behavioural, or motivational studying goals nor were they asked specifically to set SMART goals, though they were introduced to this idea in lecture.

#### Coding

Goal coding occurred as an iterative cycle. We pursued collective agreement on each goal rather than inter-rater reliability, as our previous experience with coding goals had shown that it was difficult to meet high levels of inter-rater reliability due to the large range of variation in students' self-set goals.

In Phase 1, we started with a previously developed coding scheme based on the TASC framework and developed with a sample of goals across multiple offerings of the course in a 5-year time span (Haffey, Webster, and Hadwin 2013). In particular, goals were coded for quality on the basis of whether or not they included specific actions, standards, and content as outlined in the introduction. Timeframe was dropped from coding because most goals did not provide sufficient information about the task, scope, or context to determine whether goals were realistic targets for a 2-hour study session. Completing or finishing a task did not count as an action since it did not provide any direction for cognitive engagement nor did it count as a standard since it did not provide any way to judge learning. Content was coded as present when participants identified concepts rather than a task, course, or chapter number. Three authors coded a sample of goals independently on

## Goal Categories, Frequencies, and Examples

## Table 2. Goal Categories and Examples

### Vague (n = 106)
- Understand what the point of the English readings is actually catch up on my English readings. (194, 5, task)
- Since I never seem to have enough time, my goal this week will be to use my time wisely and get the most out of my study sessions. (203, 4)
- The one goal that I am going to process for this week is to get a head start on studying for exams. I want to by the beginning of next week. Have gone through all of the mid-term exam sheets I made up for mid terms as a base for starting to draw back on concepts from the first half of the semester. (207, 9)

### Plan-to-plan (n = 43)
- In the upcoming week I plan on sitting down and figuring out where I will begin my psychology project. My goal is to go to the library and see what resources they have on my subject. I would like to gather as much information as possible so that my project will be a success. It will be a lot of work but if I get off to a good start it should make things a lot easier. (201, 3, task)
- I would like to make a solid effort to refocus and go over my goals for my courses again. I feel by going over these goals again I hope to be able to re motivate myself and focus during study sessions. To refocus I plan on making more concrete and definable study goals for each study session vs the outcome of the entire week of studying. With a definable goal for each study session I feel that I will be less likely to procrastinate as there will be a set outline of material that I need to achieve that day. (204, 3)

### Multiple with TASC (n = 16)
- Prepare for the exam. Read through Weber and Simmel, take notes from text and make concetions between the lecture notes and text material. Can compartmentalize the similarities and differences between those two theorists. Get my research paper checked by writing center, especially the grammar and the form of essay. (186, 9, action, standard)
- Exams are coming up. I want to make a web, like an outline of all key concepts. I have two final exams so I would like to do one for each. I want to be able to link concepts and get a full understanding of each so I will be prepared for my exam. (203, 11)

### All TASC (n = 13)
- I would like to have section 10.1 read and have three key examples written out by Tuesday night between 10, section 10.2 and 10.3 read and have three key examples written out between 7 and 10 Wednesday night. (182, 9, action)
- Read the powerpoint notes for Nutrition 155 Mid-term and understand the concepts of healthy eating and life. Also know the macro/micro-nutrients. (184, 6, content)
- I want to improve my ability in distinguishing the different uses of the Spanish verb tenses preterit and imperfect (211, 1, action, content)

### To-do list (n = 8)
- Study for my German test: 
  - copy vocabulary from Ch1–Ch5
  - rewrite my German notes
  - review previous quizzes and tests
  - finish online exercise (212, 11, single task)
- read books for my research project on D day and read and make specific notes in astronomy up to chapter 14. Then I'm going to start reading and making notes on chapter 12 in psychology. (205, 4, multiple tasks)
- Work on studying for CSC [child studies], PE [physical education], Hist on the bus during our road trip. We will be on the bus for about 12 hours in total so that will give my plenty of time to get some productive work done. I hope to study

## Goals and Task Analysis

One goal for this upcoming week, is start to finish reading Chapter 15 of Economics and being able to learn the market structures [concepts] for the exam. I also want to finish my French composition and some assignments that I have for my other classes. Mainly, I want to finish all of my group projects for Commerce. (208, 10)

This goal has at least four sub-goals, only one of which has a TASC element. We expect students with many tasks to have many goals; however, the lack of consistent TASC elements means that students are not consistently monitoring task understanding, directing task engagement, or setting standards for judging learning.

The majority of multiple goals focused on different tasks, as in the above goal. Less frequently, multiple goals focused on a single task, breaking it down into more specific elements or goals, such as in the following example:

This week I need to write an essay for my history class. In order to complete this task in a timely fashion, I first plan to find four sources for each of the next two nights. I then plan to use the research I collect, to formulate a thesis [action] and then create an outline [action] for my writing. (169, 11)

This goal breaks down the essay task into many parts, some of which have specific cognitive actions. We see this as an important step in being able to set TASC goals useful for regulating learning because, in order to set a goal for one specific study session, learners need to be able to break that task down into different components and choose the one piece to work on in that session. Of note, most of the multiple goals in the sample were from Week 7, perhaps at a time when students were starting to feel overwhelmed with the number of tasks and assignments in front of them.

## TASC Goals

TASC goals include three categories representing goals having one (TASC-1), two (TASC-2), or all three (TASC-3) of the TASC elements. Because the frequency of these goals was so low, we describe them together. Only one goal in our sample had all three TASC elements (emphasized by italics): "I will review the cardiovascular system in PE241b, and make flashcards outlining [action] the blood flow through the heart [concepts], and be able to recite it in my own words [standard] by Friday" (198, 9). This goal is specific about actions, standard, and content. This allows the student to monitor her task understanding (concepts), direct her task engagement (action), and judge how well she knows it at the end of her session (standard).

However, this TASC-3 goal was an anomaly. Most TASC goals included one or two TASC elements providing varied degrees of support for SRL during studying.

## To-do List Goals

Goals categorized as to-do list focused on completion of several tasks, without any TASC elements. These were behaviour-focused goals providing minimal standards for monitoring task understanding, directing engagement, or judging learning progress; these goals were a smorgasbord of things students needed to get through over the week.

Few of the to-do list goals consisted of a breakdown of one task into multiple steps; most were lists across different tasks, such as the following goal in which three tasks were identified:

Finish catching up on my English Readings (not that it think there is still much to do) (i.e. finish reading BC Oddities so that i can start working on my assignment); Start thinking about my English assignment; Finish doing maths exercises (set 10, 11, and 12) and work on maths assignment with friends in the library. (194, 6)

## Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the content of goals students set for their authentic study sessions. We created five categories to describe the goals students set over one semester in an SRL course. Despite learning about the importance of goals in SRL, students often set goals that provided little direction in terms of self-regulating their learning. Students' goals

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

Students were introduced to the following goal-setting concepts during Week 4 of the course: the role of goals in SRL, SMART goals, the importance of measurability to create a standard, and the importance of action for guiding strategy choice. The remainder of the course included strategy instruction, emphasizing connections between tasks, goals, and strategies. In Week 4 students practiced writing goals with peer and instructor support. The importance of goals was reiterated throughout the course. Formal feedback was not given on goals within the lab assignment or the weekly reflections; however, students may have received informal feedback through class discussion or individual support with their lab instructor.

## Coding and analysis

A total of 243 goals were coded using the descriptive coding scheme from Study 1. For Study 2, descriptive categories were ranked for quality. Vague, to-do list, and plan-to-plan goals were labeled low quality. Multiple and TASC-1 goals were labeled moderate quality. TASC-2 and TASC-3 goals were labeled high quality. For each participant, we created a one-row table that displayed goal categories for the nine weeks, colour-coded for quality. A team of two researchers identified groups based on patterns in goal quality over time; this was done by printing each participant's one-row table and arranging by visual patterns. Patterns were based on:

1. Quality levels (low, moderate, high), rather than the more specific descriptive goal categories
2. Changes in quality level over time

To check our patterns, two additional researchers independently examined the one-row tables for patterns over time; patterns were nearly identical to the original patterns, and any discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Finally, to create group descriptions we examined the descriptive goal categories over time and actual goals of students in each group.

## Findings

Patterns found in students' goal quality across the semester are presented with the label we chose for each group, a description of the group's pattern, and the number of students who were part of that group. Figure 1 shows the quality of all 30 students' goals across nine weeks, organized by the groups we identified.

### Consistently low quality (n = 9)

Students in the consistently low quality group set (a) low quality goals that (b) did not change across all nine weeks. There were no improvements in goal quality even after goal setting was introduced in the course. Though this group set goals that were described as vague, plan-to-plan, or to-do list, the majority of goals set by students in this group were considered vague. These ranged from "Doing my calculus homework" (226, 2) to "thoroughly answer all my questions properly" (264, 7). Generally, goals set by students in this group focused on completing tasks over larger periods of time (e.g. "by Thursday"; 264, 9). This group contained almost one third of the students in our subset.

### Attempts to improve (n = 5)

Students in this group set (a) mostly low quality goals with one or two moderate level goals that (b) were set at varied points in the semester. Similar to the consistently low quality group, the low quality goals set by students in the attempts to improve group were almost all vague, particularly focusing on vague actions such as "Take very good notes the first time I read the material" (256, 3). The moderate level goals were

## Students' Self-Set Learning Goals in University Settings

## Patterns of Goal Quality

### Bell Curve (n = 2)
- Students showed improvement with 3-5 goals at moderate level mid-semester
- Low quality goals appeared in first and last two weeks
- Goals shifted from specific actions/content to vague goals like "do research"
- Quality drop possibly due to decreased motivation or increased difficulty of less structured assignments

### Late Emergence (n = 5)
- Set 3-6 moderate quality goals towards semester end
- Improvement began after goal-setting lecture
- Lower quality goals were typically vague
- Moderate goals showed TASC-1 qualities with specific actions
- Specific standards and content were rare
- Improvements were inconsistent

### Improvement (n = 4)
- 3-4 high-quality goals set at varied points
- Showed inconsistency in maintaining high-quality goals
- Most high-quality goals among all groups, with multiple TASC-2 goals
- Goals featured specific content and actions
- Specific standards remained rare
- All showed improvement after Week 4 goal-setting lecture
- Inconsistent application of principles

### Erratic Improvement (n = 5)
- No clear pattern in goal setting
- Each student had 1+ moderate quality goals and 1-2 high-quality goals
- Changes appeared random

## Discussion

### Study 2 Findings
- Six patterns identified: consistently low quality, attempts to improve, bell curve, late emergence, improvement, and erratic improvement
- Small improvements in goals overall
- Improvements minimal and inconsistent despite explicit instruction

### Overall Discussion
- Research explored students' self-set goals in authentic university settings
- Focus on single-session learning regulation goals using Winne and Hadwin's SRL model
- Key findings:
  1. Study 1: Goals generally too vague for strategy guidance; TASC properties rare
  2. Study 2: Improvements in goal quality inconsistent across semester

### Possible Explanations
1. Students may not articulate full internal goal specificity
2. Low motivation to set and document high-quality goals
3. Goal setting viewed as form-filling rather than learning opportunity

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

A third explanation of low quality goal setting may be that poor goals indicate weak task understanding, meaning students do not really know what they are supposed to be learning or doing during self-guided study time. Their perceptions of academic work may be limited to explicit tasks such as 'read chapter 7' rather than the purpose of those tasks in their course or program of study (e.g. understand the difference between types of organisms). Since task perceptions are foundational for SRL (Winne and Hadwin 1998), this potential lack of task understanding may have widespread implications for success in university. These three suggestions highlight potential avenues for future research aiming to examine and support students' self-set goals.

The goals set by participants in our study had one similarity with assigned goals used in the organizational literature (e.g. Winters and Latham 1996) that might suggest cause for concern: The vague goals students set, such as 'To finish my optional assignment', are reminiscent of the 'do your best' goals that are assigned in organizational research for a specific task. In both cases, a task is identified, but there is no guidance in terms of choosing strategies or monitoring progress. This is problematic because results in the organizational literature suggest that 'do your best' goals lead to lower performance than specific outcome goals (see Locke and Latham 2002).

As with any study, we acknowledge there are limitations. First, the sample was drawn from a specific population of university students. That is, students self-selected to take a learning-to-learn course and, thus, may not be representative of the typical university learner. We recommend examining self-set goals for students who are not learning about SRL. Second, students were required to set goals as part of their coursework. The kinds of goals students set spontaneously or whether students set goals at all for their studying is unclear and warrants further research. Despite the limitations, we highlight two particular strengths of this study: (a) students set their own goals, rather than being assigned goals; and (b) goals were related to actual coursework, rather than to experimental tasks. Examining self-set goals for real-life study sessions makes an important contribution to understanding how students tackle studying and regulate learning during studying.

In this paper, we proposed the TASC framework for effective studying goals, which provided a useful base for developing a goal coding scheme. However, empirical validation of the effectiveness of the framework is needed. This could be done in at least two ways: (a) compare task performance when assigned goals either include or exclude TASC properties or (b) compare task performance across levels of goal quality when goals are self-set. Considering the quality of goals in our current dataset, the latter suggestion may require more effective interventions for consistently setting high-quality TASC goals.

For students who have to make decisions about how to use their independent study time, being able to break tasks down into manageable goals is a critical skill. Findings from this study suggest this is not an easy task for many students who tend to set vague goals for studying at best, and who often struggle to refine or improve those goals over time. Our findings lend support to a growing recognition that students transitioning from high school to university and suddenly being faced with a larger proportion of self-directed study versus teacher-directed study hours, may have very limited conceptions of what it means to study.

This study contributes to the goal-setting literature by extending existing research to the educational context and focusing explicitly on self-set goals. In terms of practice, this study documents the outcomes of a preliminary attempt to intervene with student goal setting by prompting students to set goals for studying on a weekly basis and informing students about the types of goals that might be more effective for a specific study session. Though the goals observed in these studies were generally poor in quality, anecdotal reports from students suggest that being taught about goals for SRL is helpful. Findings highlight the importance of designing and testing the effectiveness of interventions to support students in setting goals for independent and self-directed study time as well as of striving to uncover students' task understanding related to academic work and study tasks.
