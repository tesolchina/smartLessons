# Self-regulated learning strategies predict learner behavior and goal attainment in Massive Open Online Courses

Renée F. Kizilcec, Mar Pérez-Sanagustín, Jorge J. Maldonado

## Abstract

Individuals with strong self-regulated learning (SRL) skills, characterized by the ability to plan, manage and control their learning process, can learn faster and outperform those with weaker SRL skills. SRL is critical in learning environments that provide low levels of support and guidance, as is commonly the case in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Learners can be trained to engage in SRL and actively supported with prompts and activities. However, effective implementation of learner support systems in MOOCs requires an understanding of which SRL strategies are most effective and how these strategies manifest in online behavior. Moreover, identifying learner characteristics that are predictive of weaker SRL skills can advance efforts to provide targeted support without obtrusive survey instruments. We investigated SRL in a sample of 4,831 learners across six MOOCs based on individual records of overall course achievement, interactions with course content, and survey responses. We found that goal setting and strategic planning predicted attainment of personal course goals, while help seeking was associated with lower goal attainment. Learners with stronger SRL skills were more likely to revisit previously studied course materials, especially course assessments. Several learner characteristics, including demographics and motivation, predicted learners' SRL skills. We discuss implications for theory and the development of learning environments that provide adaptive support.

## 1. Introduction

A primary goal of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is to provide more people with opportunities for personal and intellectual growth. Between late 2011 and 2015, 550 institutions created 4,200 courses that reached over 35 million people worldwide, according to data collected by Class Central (Shah, 2015). Most learners who enroll in MOOCs selectively engage with parts of the course content and a small proportion eventually completes the course (Anderson, Huttenlocher, Kleinberg, & Leskovec, 2014; Breslow et al., 2013; Evans, Baker, & Dee, 2016; Ho et al., 2015; Kizilcec, Piech, & Schneider, 2013; Perna et al., 2014; Seaton, Bergner, Chuang, Mitros, & Pritchard, 2014). This variation in behavior can be partly attributed to the remarkable diversity of leaners' backgrounds, motivations, intentions, and prior experiences (de Barba, Kennedy, & Ainley, 2016; Kizilcec & Schneider, 2015; Littlejohn, Hood, Milligan, & Mustain, 2016; Zheng, Rosson, Shih, & Carroll, 2015).

In fact, only half of the survey respondents in a typical MOOC report that they intend to complete the course to receive a certificate (Kizilcec & Schneider, 2015; Littlejohn & Milligan, 2015; Reich, 2014). However, even among learners who have ambitious goals for the course and who are committed to achieve them, a majority of learners is unsuccessful. The primary reasons for attrition in MOOCs are related to poor time management and course difficulty, according to both quantitative (Kizilcec & Halawa, 2015; Nawrot & Doucet, 2014) and qualitative (Zheng, Rosson, Shih, & Carroll, 2015) research.

## Self-Regulated Learning in Online Learning and MOOCs

learners set goals for their learning and then attempt to monitor, regulate and control their cognition, intentions and behavior, guided and constrained by their goals and the contextual features of the environment." In contrast, Zimmerman (2000, p. 14) describes SRL as "self-generated thoughts, feelings, and actions that are planned and cyclically adapted to the attainment of personal goals." Both models have been influential in the literature and share common ideas. Here we follow in the tradition of Pintrich's model, because its focus on particular strategies lends itself more to large-scale quantitative investigations that can inform targeted interventions to support specific SRL strategies.

Predicated on the notion that self-regulation can be trained, Pintrich identified three categories of SRL strategies that learners can apply to regulate their learning:

1. cognitive
2. metacognitive
3. resource management strategies

Learners utilize cognitive strategies in the acquisition, storage, and retrieval of information (e.g., rehearsal, critical thinking, organization, elaboration). Learners utilize metacognitive strategies to plan, monitor and regulate their learning process to accomplish a goal (e.g., goal setting and strategic planning, self-monitoring, and self-evaluation). Learners utilize resource management strategies to manage the learning environment and external resources (e.g., time management, help seeking, effort regulation and organizing one's study environment).

### Self-regulated learning in online learning and MOOCs

In this section, we review literature to identify the most effective SRL strategies in online learning environments.

Compared to in-person instruction, contemporary online learning environments tend to provide learners with less support and guidance on how to learn deeply yet efficiently. Online learners are expected to actively and autonomously engage in the learning process (C.-H. Wang, Shannon, & Ross, 2013), which demands both a high level of confidence in their own abilities and the ability to manage their own learning process (Liang & Tsai, 2008; Sun & Rueda, 2012; Tsai, Chuang, Liang, & Tsai, 2011). Learners who struggle to regulate their learning process effectively tend to experience frustration and become less engaged in the course (Sun & Rueda, 2012), and they are ultimately less successful (Lee, Shen, & Tsai, 2008; Samruayruen, Enriquez, Natakuatoong, & Samruayruen, 2013; Tsai, 2009).

Prior work in online learning environments demonstrated improvements in academic achievement from applying SRL strategies, especially time management, metacognition, and effort regulation strategies (Azevedo & Aleven, 2013; Broadbent & Poon, 2015; Niemi, Nevgi, & Virtanen, 2003). These strategies help learners process and retain knowledge in a structured manner (Beishuizen & Steffens, 2011; Dignath & Büttner, 2008; Pintrich, 2004; Zimmerman, 2008). Several studies found that providing scaffolding for these strategies can support SRL and raise achievement (Azevedo, Moos, Greene, Winters, & Cromley, 2008; Kim & Hodges, 2012; Taub, Azevedo, Bouchet, & Khosravifar, 2014). Supportive feedback, such as clarifying to learners what constitutes good performance and encouraging positive motivational beliefs, can support SRL and it can be implemented in online learning environments at large scale (Nicol & Macfarlane-dick, 2006).

The recent availability of large and fine-grained datasets has led to investigations at the intersection of SRL and learning analytics. The assessment of frequencies and sequences of regulatory activities in learning environments provides a novel perspective on SRL that complements and potentially supers

the course to internalize it, and creating summaries or mind maps of lecture content (self-evaluation, self-monitoring). This account of learner-generated strategies complements the findings on reasons for attrition.

Overall, based on the findings of prior work on self-regulation in online learning environments, and MOOCs in particular, we focus on metacognitive strategies and resource and task management strategies. Specifically, we consider the following strategies that are expected to support learners in MOOCs (exemplary definitions from the literature are provided):

1. Goal setting: Setting of educational goals or sub-goals in order to exert the effort required to achieve those goals (Schunk, 2005; Zimmerman, 2000).
2. Strategic planning: Planning the sequence, timing, and completion of activities directed at learning goals (Zimmerman & Pons, 1986).
3. Self-evaluation: Setting quality standards and criteria for progress to judge one's own performance (Boud, 1995). Activities for monitoring the learning process in relation to defined learning goals (Schunk, 2005).
4. Task strategy: Organizing, planning, and transforming one's own study time (time management) and tasks (i.e., timing, sequencing, pacing, rearrangement of instructional materials) (Effeney, Carroll, & Bahr, 2013; Zimmerman & Pons, 1986). Activities to improve persistence and effort-regulation in the face of academic challenge (Richardson, Abraham, & Bond, 2012).
5. Elaboration: Combining new knowledge with prior knowledge and constructing meaning from learned materials (Niemi et al., 2003). Extending or modifying the learning materials to make them more meaningful and memorable (Weinstein, Acee, & Jung, 2011).
6. Help seeking: Asking other people for help, such as the instructor or one's peers, or consulting external help and resources (Pintrich, 1999; Richardson et al., 2012).

### Individual differences in self-regulated learning and online course behavior

Prior research has investigated how individual differences between learners might relate to both self-reported SRL and behavior in MOOCs. First, in terms of self-reported SRL, learners who report higher levels of motivation, commitment to learn, formal education, and relevant prior knowledge also indicate higher levels of SRL (Hood, Littlejohn, & Milligan, 2015; Littlejohn et al., 2016). Hood et al. (2015) examined how learners' context (i.e., background characteristics) influences their ability to self-regulate their learning in MOOCs. They found higher levels of SRL among learners with a higher level of formal education and among working professionals in domains related to the course content. Littlejohn et al. (2016) found differences between learners with varying levels of SRL in their reported motivations and goals for the course, which apparently shaped their approach to the MOOC and their use of learning strategies. On the basis of in-depth interviews, they identified differences in self-described learning behaviors between learners with low versus high SRL profiles for five SRL sub-processes. By contrast, several investigations have found no significant gender differences in terms of SRL in the context of various digital learning environments (Basol & Balgalmis, 2016; Liou & Kuo, 2014; Yukselturk & Top, 2013).

Second, numerous studies have found individual differences in learners' engagement and achievement in MOOCs. Empirical investigations have linked variation in course behavior and achievement with various individual differences: learners' demographic and personal background (Evans et al., 2016; Guo & Reinecke, 2014; Hansen & Reich, 2015; Kizilcec & Halawa, 2015), motivations for enrolling and intentions for the course (de Barba et al., 2016

## Self-Regulated Learning in MOOCs

## Research Questions

Prior studies examined SRL in small-scale online environments, but how SRL manifests in learners' actual interactions with course content in MOOCs has received no scholarly attention. Moreover, we found no evidence on the relative efficacy of different SRL strategies to support online learners achieve personal learning goals over time. We identified six SRL strategies that have been related to academic achievement in online learning and MOOCs in prior work (see Section 2.2). However, the relative extent to which these SRL strategies predict differences in achieving personal goals in MOOCs is unknown. We therefore pose the following two research questions:

1. Which self-reported SRL strategies are most helpful to achieve personal course goals?
2. How do self-reported SRL strategies manifest in interactions with course content?

The second gap in the literature concerns our understanding of individual differences in SRL. Prior work found individual characteristics of learners such as their level of education, gender, age, course intentions, and motivations to be associated with performance in the course. For example, prior investigations have demonstrated that learners with more formal education self-report stronger SRL skills and exhibit higher persistence and achievement (Hood et al., 2015; Kizilcec & Halawa, 2015). However, there has not been a systematic analysis of individual characteristics that predict learners' self-reported SRL, because this demands a large and diverse survey sample of learners, which is rarely available outside of MOOCs. Insight into individual differences in SRL can support efforts to develop targeted intervention, for example, by using this information to set Bayesian priors in models. We will identify a broad set of individual differences in SRL in terms of characteristics, many of which were examined in prior work (demographics, course intentions, motivations, etc.) to investigate the following research question:

3. How do self-reported SRL strategies vary by individual learner characteristics?

## Methods

### Participants and Context

The final study sample included 4,831 online learners in six distinct MOOCs on topics in Engineering, Computer Science, Management, Transportation, and Education. The courses were offered by Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile through Coursera were taught in Spanish and followed a self-paced format, such that course materials were available all at once without deadlines. Each course encompassed 6-10 sections, each containing 5-10 video lectures and several assessments (e.g., multiple-choice quizzes, peer-review activities). Most course assessments were formative and could be attempted multiple times. The target audiences of these courses were high school & college students and professionals in subject-related industries. To improve the generalizability of our findings, we selected courses with a range of topics that would in turn attract a diverse learner audience. Indeed, based on self-reported demographics, the average age was 32.0 (SD = 10.8), 26% were women, 63% held a bachelor's or higher degree (15% a master's or Ph.D.), 60% were employed, and 25% were students. Data was collected between April and December 2015.

The final sample is a subset of the 6,709 learners who answered the initial course survey about their SRL strategies and various individual characteristics, including demographics, course intentions and motivations. The following exclusions were made: First, 385 responses were removed from learners who either took the survey more than once in the same course, or completed virtually no survey questions. Another 1,450 responses had to be excluded because it was not possible to combine the survey data with corresponding course data (data entry errors resulted in unmatched responses, because we relied on information that was manually entered by survey respondents to merge the datasets). The remaining 4,874 responses came from 4,831 unique learners, as 43 learners were enrolled in two of the six courses. To reduce complexity in the analysis, we randomly selected one of the courses for each of these 43 learners.

### Measures

Participants completed an

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

The resulting questionnaire (see Appendix) had participants rate 23 statements about SRL strategies on how characteristic they were for them on a labeled 5-point scale (coded 0 to 4): goal setting strategies (4 statements), strategic planning (4), self-evaluation (3), task strategies (6), elaboration (3), and help seeking (4). The order in which statements were presented in the survey was randomized.

The individual score for each strategy was computed by averaging ratings of corresponding items. Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the collected SRL survey data with an exemplary statement for each strategy and a composite computed by averaging scores for all strategies. The SRL measure had high reliability for all strategy subscales with Cronbach's α of at least 0.75, despite the small number of items used. As shown in Table 1, the help-seeking subscale had a lower mean and lower correlation with the composite; this may be partly because it was the only subscale that included a reverse-coded item. A small amount of missing responses (fewer than 5%) was imputed using predictive mean matching (Little, 1988), a method that accounts for the joint distribution of observations on all other items to predict the most likely value for a missing observation; in general, this technique yields lower non-response bias than simple mean imputation or discarding incomplete responses (cf. Buuren & Groothuis-Oudshoorn, 2011).

### Analytic approach

We addressed RQ1 about the relationship between SRL and achieving personal course goals by assessing associations between each strategy and course outcomes depending on learners' stated course goal. We used non-parametric Spearman correlation coefficients, because the outcome data was either binary or skewed. Additionally, we fitted logistic regression models to evaluate the predictive power of the six SRL strategies simultaneously.

To investigate RQ2 about how SRL strategies manifest in interactions with course content, we computed relevant variables that characterize learners' interactions in the course. First, we preprocessed records of learners' interactions with course materials to identify individual sessions, defined here as sustained periods of activity during which a learner interacts with the course materials at least once in two hours. Then, within each individual session, consecutive interactions with the same object in the course materials were aggregated and labeled based on learners' progress with the object. Table 2 provides definitions for the different interaction states. Interactions with any course object lasting for less than five seconds were excluded to reduce noise. The resulting dataset was then aggregated in two ways for analysis: first at the level of individual transitions, we computed the frequency of transitions from one interaction state to another within sessions, and second at the level of sessions, we computed activity metrics during each session in terms of (i) time spent on different content types or progress states, (ii) the number of materials interacted with during the session, and (iii) the time spent between sessions.

#### Transition-level analysis
For the analysis of individual transitions between interaction states, as defined in Table 2, we counted the frequency of direct state transitions, yielding a six by six transition matrix for each learner. The transition counts were transformed into transition probabilities and normalized for each initial interaction state. Fig. 1 illustrates this transition graph. For clarity, only arrows for transition probabilities greater than 15% are shown and the transition probability is indicated next to each arrow. We evaluated correlations between learners' reported SRL strategies and their individual transition probabilities for the 36 possible transitions. This yielded a total of 6 * 36 = 216 Spearman correlation coefficients. To focus on the most robust patterns, we only considered highly significant correlations (p < 0.01, based on 10,000 course-clustered bootstrap replications). Of the 34 highly significant correlations, 14 correlations were relatively large in magnitude (i.e., |r| > 0.045; max. |r| = 0.065).

## Results

We begin with general observations about the survey results. Learners reported an average time commitment of 4.9 hours per week (SD = 3.1; median = 4). The vast majority reported an intention to watch all lectures (95%) and complete all assessments (93%) in the course. Half of the learners reported having prior experience with the course topic and a majority had prior experience with online courses (number of prior online courses started: M = 2.4, SD = 4.0, median = 1; number of completed courses: M = 1.8, SD = 3.2, median = 1). The most pronounced SRL strategies reported were self-evaluation and elaboration, followed by strategic planning, task strategies, and goal setting; the least common strategy was help seeking (Table 1). Moreover, several of the SRL strategies were highly correlated, such as goal setting with strategic planning (r = 0.70), strategic planning with task strategies (r = 0.66), and task strategies with elaboration (r = 0.72). Help seeking was the least correlated strategy with the overall SRL composite.

### Which self-reported SRL strategies are most helpful to achieve personal course goals? (RQ1)

We evaluated how SRL strategies were related to achieving three different personal course goals: first, earning a course certificate, which required achieving satisfactory grades on course assessments; second, completing assessments (independent of grades), and third, watching lectures in the course. For each personal goal, we assessed the correlation between self-reported SRL strategies and goal attainment among those who expressed the goal. Results are provided in Table 3. We found that goal setting and strategic planning were significant positive predictors of goal attainment for all three goals. In contrast, help seeking was a significant negative predictor of goal attainment (except for completing lectures, p = 0.069). Self-evaluation and task strategies were predictive only of completing assessments and lectures, while elaboration was not at all correlated with goal attainment.

In light of high correlations between strategies, we proceeded to fit logistic regression models to evaluate all six SRL strategies simultaneously when predicting goal attainment. Goal setting was a strong positive predictor of goal attainment, while help seeking was a strong negative predictor. Results were consistent across personal course goals and robust to regression adjustment for available covariates (demographics, experience, commitment, etc.), and notably, strategic planning was also a strong positive predictor with goal setting excluded from the model. For example, learners who indicated 1 SD higher levels of goal setting had 54% higher odds of achieving their goal of earning a certificate (z = 2.68, p = 0.007). By contrast, the same model yielded 27% lower odds of certification (z = -3.11, p = 0.002) for learners who indicated 1 SD higher levels of help seeking. Likewise, coefficient estimates predicting the other course goals were highly significant and only somewhat smaller. Thus, learners who engaged in goal setting and avoided help seeking were significantly more likely to achieve their personal course goals. Although several other SRL strategies were individually associated with goal attainment, goal setting and help seeking emerged as the two key predictors.

| Strategy<br>Example statement | M (SD) | α | 2. | 3. | 4. | 5. | 6. | x |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Goal Setting<br>I set realistic deadlines for learning. | 3.0 (0.76) | 0.86 | 0.70 | 0.48 | 0.57 | 0.46 | 0.29 | 0.78 |

## Self-Regulated Learning Manifestations in Course Interactions

## How do self-reported SRL strategies manifest in interactions with course content? (RQ2)

Manifestations of self-reported SRL were evaluated first at the level of individual transitions and then based on per-session activity. The two analytic approaches are meant to provide complementary perspectives on how SRL manifests in course behavior.

First, we considered learner behavior at the level of individual transitions between interaction states, as defined in Table 2. The transition graph in Fig. 1 shows that, after completing a lecture, learners were most likely to complete another lecture (in 74% of cases) or pass an assessment (13%; arrow omitted in Fig. 1). In comparison, learners who just passed an assessment were most likely to complete a lecture next (66%). Those who attempted an assessment without passing it went on to either attempt (29%) or pass (19%) a different assessment, or complete (21%) or revisit (27%) a lecture. The remaining transitions depicted in Fig. 1 can be interpreted the same way. To assess how differences in SRL manifest in individual transitions, we evaluated correlations between SRL strategies and individual transition probabilities for the six strategies and 36 possible transitions (out of the 6 * 36 = 216 correlations, 14 stood out as significant and relatively strong patterns; see Section 3.5).

Results are summarized in Table 4 with descriptions of the 14 identified transition patterns by SRL strategy. Overall, learners who report stronger SRL skills were more inclined to revisit course materials after completing other materials, instead of starting new materials. An exception to this overarching trend: learners inclined to seek help were less likely to pass an assessment after completing a lecture.

Second, we analyzed course behavior based on per-session activity. In comparison to the analysis of individual transitions, the per-session activity analysis provided coarser but more contextualized behavioral indicators, including detailed information about the total amount, the proportion of time, and the median amount of time spent on various course activities across sessions. Note that the distinction between total time, proportion of time, and median time is meaningful.

### Tables

| Interaction State | Definition |
|------------------|------------|
| Lecture Begin | Begin but not complete watching a lecture that was not previously completed. |
| Lecture Complete | Complete watching a lecture for the first time. The lecture may have been begun before but not completed. |
| Lecture Revisit | Watch (part of) a lecture that was completely watched in the past. |
| Assessment Attempt | Attempt but not pass an assessment that was not previously passed. |
| Assessment Pass | Pass an assessment for the first time. The assessment may have been attempted before but not passed. |

## How Self-Regulated Learning Strategies Manifest in Behavior

While the total amount reveals how much time someone spends on specific materials, the proportion of time reveals how someone spends their time in the course; for instance, devoting relatively more time to assessments than lectures is expected to enhance learning (Koedinger, Mclaughlin, Kim, Zhuxin Jia, & Bier, 2015). The median complements the other two metrics by characterizing activity in a typical session. We evaluated correlations between six SRL strategies and 22 behavioral indicators (out of the 6 * 22 = 132 correlations, 18 stood out as strong and significant patterns; see Section 3.5).

Results are summarized in Table 4 with descriptions of the 18 identified patterns by SRL strategy. Overall, learners who reported using more goal setting, strategic planning, self-evaluation, and task strategies spent more time in absolute and relative terms on revisiting assessments. Moreover, learners who reported using more goal setting and strategic planning also spent more time on assessments in a typical session; learners who reported using more task strategies devoted more time to revisiting lectures.

### How do self-reported SRL strategies vary by individual learner characteristics? (RQ3)

We assessed individual differences in self-reported SRL strategies based on 27 individual characteristics, encompassing demographics, prior experience, time commitment, goals and motivations. Fig. 2 illustrates the results of six penalized regressions, one for each SRL strategy, with coefficient estimates from each model in each column. Blank entries in Fig. 2 indicate that the penalized regression estimation shrunk a coefficient to zero, thereby excluding the corresponding predictor from the model. Estimates are adjusted for all other predictors in the model; for example, the coefficient on age is estimated adjusting for all other characteristics in the model, such as occupation and level of education.

A number of individual differences emerged for learner demographics. Older learners reported consistently higher levels of SRL, except for help seeking. Women reported lower levels of strategic planning, elaboration, and self-evaluation; however, women reported higher levels of goal setting, task strategies, and especially help seeking. Compared to the 37% of learners in the sample who had not earned at least a bachelor's degree, those with a bachelor's degree reported lower strategic planning, self-evaluation, and help seeking. By contrast, learners with a professional or master's degree, and especially those with a Ph.D. reported higher levels of goal setting, strategic planning, and task strategies. While learners with a Ph.D. reported generally strong SRL skills, they reported being much less inclined to seek help. Learners who were also students in school or university reported consistently lower SRL, especially for self-evaluation and task strategies. In contrast, learners who were employed were more inclined to engage in goal setting, strategic planning, and help seeking, despite lower levels of self-evaluation.

Individual differences by learners' prior experience were more consistent across strategies. Learners who had started more online courses in the past consistently reported lower SRL, while those who had completed more online courses consistently reported higher SRL, especially goal setting. Those with prior experience with the course topic reported higher levels for most SRL strategies, but were less inclined to seek help. Furthermore, learners who were willing to commit more time to the course reported consistently higher SRL. Likewise, SRL skills were substantially higher—up to 0.5 SD—among learners who expressed the goal of either finishing all lectures or finishing all assessments.

Finally, SRL also varied by learners' motivations for enrolling in the course. The following enrollment intentions were generally associated with higher SRL skills: enrolling to earn a certificate, to meet new people, to take the course with others, for the prestige of the institution or instructor, or because the course is relevant to one's research, one's job, or one's school/

## Discussion

This study provides a quantitative account of SRL that advances our understanding of which SRL strategies support online learners in MOOCs, how different strategies manifest behaviorally in the learning environment, and how SRL strategies vary across a heterogeneous group of learners. Our results are based on an analysis of survey and platform log data from 4,831 learners across six MOOCs. We briefly summarize the findings pertaining to each of the three research questions that we investigated.

First, which self-reported SRL strategies are most helpful to achieve personal course goals? (RQ1) We found that learners who reported engaging more in goal setting and strategic planning were more likely to attain personal course goals, such as earning a certificate—consistent with prior research on these strategies (e.g., Schunk, 2005; Zimmerman & Pons, 1986; Zimmerman, 2000). In contrast, help seeking was a negative predictor of goal attainment, unlike in prior work (Pintrich, 1999; Richardson et al., 2012). Interpretations of these findings are discussed below.

Second, how do self-reported SRL strategies manifest in interactions with course content? (RQ2) Drawing on two operationalizations of interactions with course content (individual transitions and per-session activity), we found that high levels of self-reported SRL (except for help seeking) manifested in frequent revisiting of course materials—especially course assessments—that were previously completed. However, those inclined to seek help were actually less likely to pass assessments after lectures.

Third, how do self-reported SRL strategies vary by individual learner characteristics? (RQ3) A large number of significant individual differences in self-reported SRL were found. Gender differences emerged in the use of multiple SRL strategies; in particular, women were more inclined to seek help than men, in contrast to prior work that found gender differences (Basol & Balgalmis, 2016; Liou & Kuo, 2014; Yukselturk & Top, 2013). Learners with a Ph.D. were generally more self-regulated, but much less inclined to seek help. In contrast, learners who were also students reported lower SRL, especially for self-evaluation and task strategies. Learners with ambitious course intentions, greater time commitment, and prior experience with the topic generally indicated stronger SRL skills. Finally, motivations for taking the course that signaled a relevant and supportive life context (taking course with a friend, course relevant to job/school/research, etc.) predicted stronger SRL skills, while motivations that signaled a less supportive context (taking course for fun and challenge, to experience a MOOC, for career change, etc.) predicted weaker SRL skills.

### Implications

The present findings have implications for theory and practice around SRL in the context of MOOCs and similar online learning environments. We discuss four implications of our findings in the context of prior work:

1. Supporting goal setting and strategic planning
2. Interpreting behavioral manifestations of SRL
3. Interpreting the negative results for help seeking
4. Leveraging insights from individual differences

First, goal setting and strategic planning stood out as particularly helpful strategies in MOOCs. Learners who reportedly engaged in these metacognitive strategies were more likely to achieve their course goals and engaged more deeply with course assessments, perhaps because they also appreciate the value of assessments for checking their understanding and receiving feedback to support their learning. The results are consistent with accounts from prior work that highlight goal setting and strategic planning as important factors underlying attrition and achievement in MOOCs (Kizilcec & Halawa, 2015; Kizilcec, Piech, & Schneider, 2016; Nawrot & Doucet, 2014; Zheng et al., 2015).

Finding that help seeking negatively predicts completing assessments after completing lectures suggests that learners who are not inclined to seek help may be more confident in their abilities. As a result, they are more motivated to test their knowledge with assessments and complete them successfully. Prior work on intelligent tutoring systems, where learners can request hints from the system at any time, found that help seeking does not necessarily support learning, because learners may not request hints at the right time (Aleven, Stahl, Schworm, Fischer, & Wallace, 2003). Moreover, norms around help seeking vary across cultural contexts, with more organic helping behavior occurring in more collectivist contexts (Ogan et al., 2015). Thus, effective scaffolding for help seeking in MOOCs may need to adapt to different contexts, and in addition to conveying the potential benefits of help seeking, it should provide guidance on when to choose productive struggle over seeking help.

Fourth, our findings of individual differences in SRL between learners who expressed different motivations for taking the course provide empirical evidence consistent with recent work. Hood et al. (2015) also found increased self-reported self-regulated learning behaviors among learners who studied or worked in a field related to the course topic compared to those without a topic-relevant role or context. Littlejohn et al. (2016) conducted in-depth interviews with MOOC learners and found consistent evidence for the role of learners' context in shaping their perceptions of their learning process and the purpose of the course. Specifically, learners with a relevant professional context reported higher SRL skills and expressed motivations related to professional development, which allowed them to view MOOCs as a non-formal learning opportunity. The present study confirms these findings with a large set of contextual indicators derived from learners' enrollment intentions. Our findings suggest that individual differences in terms of commonly available learner characteristics (e.g., course intentions, education level, employment status, gender) could be leveraged in combination with real-time behavioral data to provide adaptive scaffolding. The design of scaffolding certainly needs to be informed by causal evidence to determine which nudges and embedded support systems actually improve learning outcomes and course goal attainment (for examples of SRL interventions in MOOCs that did not have a positive impact, see Davis, Chen, Zee, Hauff, & Houben, 2016; Kizilcec et al., 2016).

The scale and level of heterogeneity in MOOCs offers an unprecedented opportunity to advance our understanding of what are the critical dimensions for adaptive SRL scaffolding. Thanks to increasingly large and diverse learner samples, minority subpopulations that would historically be aggregated with a majority group can receive the scholarly attention that they deserve, without compromising scientific rigor (Kizilcec & Brooks, in press).

## Limitations

The present study has three notable limitations that, although common in this type of work, should be noted when drawing conclusions from our findings. The first limitation concerns external validity. The study is based on a sample of mostly Latin American learners engaging in MOOCs that were offered in Spanish. On the one hand, given that most published findings are based on samples from Western educated industrialized rich democratic countries (Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010), this study advances the inclusivity of our science by drawing on a non-traditional sample. On the other hand, as noted here and in prior work, learners' socio-cultural context has consequences for how they perceive and engage with online courses (e.g., Guo & Reinecke, 2014; Ogan et al., 2015). While our findings are consistent with prior work that considered other international populations, future work should replicate and extend the current findings with other samples to test generalizability. The same argument applies to the specific courses that were studied, which were self-paced MOOCs on the Coursera platform in 2015. Prior work found differences between the staggered versus all-at-once content release format for MOOCs in terms of persistence

## Conclusion

This study contributes to laying the groundwork for an educational scientific evolution of leveraging new data sources and methodologies to advance educational theory and practice. Until recently, most educational researchers had the choice of investigating small-scale but rich learner data (e.g., classroom observation, laboratory studies) or large-scale but shallow learner data (e.g., standardized test scores, field surveys). The research opportunities in digital learning environments promise to deliver the best of both worlds, rich and large-scale educational data with the ability to learn from randomized experiments at a rapid pace (cf. Reich, 2015). 

An important challenge in this domain is finding effective ways to connect empirical work back to theory to contribute to generalizable knowledge. This concern has been raised by leading scholars in learning analytics in general and specifically in the context of data-intensive research on SRL (Gašević, Dawson, & Siemens, 2015; Winne, 2014). Observational accounts of SRL in in vivo online learning environments, such as the current study, offer a window into the reality of SRL over time for online learners from diverse backgrounds. This type of research marks the necessary transition from established theory and the empirical work that supports it to applications in novel contexts that offer different affordances and concern broader populations. The resulting correlational findings permit refinement of theory and can inform the next wave of experimental research (e.g., identifying SRL interventions that help learners in MOOCs) and subsequent evaluations of adaptive systems (e.g., identifying heterogeneous treatment effects to understand which intervention works when for whom). To this end, our research findings offer an account of SRL in MOOCs that quantifies the relative benefits of different learning strategies, identifies behavioral manifestations of different strategies, and exposes individual differences in self-reported SRL.

Finally, we highlight three promising directions for future research in this area:

1. The development of predictive models of when learners fail to apply SRL strategies that would support their learning—this can inform small but timely interventions (e.g., prompting a learner with "Have you tried explaining this concept to yourself?").
2. The development of feedback systems that facilitate self-monitoring of SRL strategies for learners with weak metacognitive skills. This will require new approaches to reliably quantify SRL engagement from behavioral traces.
3. Interventions to support SRL for a global and diverse learner population. It may be necessary to adapt strategies for different social and cultural contexts to be effective.

Research to address these three challenges will serve to advance our current understanding of SRL in online environments and inform new strategies to better support learners.
