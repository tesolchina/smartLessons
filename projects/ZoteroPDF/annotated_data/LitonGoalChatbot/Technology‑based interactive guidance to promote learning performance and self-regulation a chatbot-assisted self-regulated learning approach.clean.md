## Abstract

Self-regulated learning (SRL) is an approach to learning which aims to improve learners' learning outcomes. In the SRL cycle, the quality of students' reflections is a critical factor in SRL performance that can improve learning outcomes. The feedback provided by teachers often has a significant impact on the quality of students' reflections. However, research has shown that teachers are often confronted with many students and so are unable to give individual feedback. To address this problem, this study proposed chatbot-assisted SRL, which provides personal and immediate feedback during the SRL process to promote the quality of students' reflection. This study applied this approach in the "Website Design" unit of an Introduction to Multimedia course. Two classes of second-year university students were the participants. One class with 23 students was the experimental group using the chatbot-assisted SRL mode, whereas the other class with 24 students was the control group using the conventional SRL mode. The experiment results showed that the proposed approach improved the students' performance, motivation, SRL, reflection, and meta-cognition tendency more than the conventional SRL approach.

## Introduction

Self-regulated learning (SRL) is one of the strategies to support student learning. In recent years many emerging technologies such as smartphones, wearable devices and various immersion technologies have also been added to support SRL applications. Based on the SRL model, these approaches combine various technological devices such as technology tutoring systems to support SRL, game-based learning, virtual reality learning, and multimedia environment learning, which allows students to experience the cycle of SRL repeatedly through the contextual systems provided by technology. This in turn enables them to enhance their learning outcomes and attitudes in the learning process.

However, research has also identified the importance of monitoring and responding to SRL in the context of technology-assisted contexts in general. Still, these responses may not enable learners to make proper decisions needed for improving their learning status, which would result in SRL being compromised. Therefore, teachers need to provide appropriate guidance and feedback to allow students more time for reflection.

The learning objective of the Introduction to Multimedia course is to enable students to develop the self-discipline to complete their website work. Hence, students begin implementing the project after setting their goals during the creative design process. The design needs to be constantly reflected upon and revised to achieve the best results. However, in the learning process, learners are usually most motivated initially, but if they experience setbacks and learning bottlenecks in the process, it can affect their learning. Therefore, giving learners external assistance and feedback can help improve their SRL.

Feedback from teachers or peers during lessons can facilitate reflection. Reflecting is important for SRL; it can help learners understand where problems are and how to solve them; also, feedback requires timely and specific advice. Personalized feedback helps students to identify gaps in their learning, develop meta-cognition, understand their learning, reflect on their behavior, and self-assess, all of which can improve their learning outcomes. However, due to teaching many students, the teacher cannot give immediate individual feedback and advice. The timely feedback and convenience of chatbots have therefore attracted the interest of educators. Chatbots have begun to be applied in education, allowing students to easily talk to the chatbot, which can meet their needs by establishing a relaxed and friendly interactive relationship to achieve a learner-centered learning environment. Therefore, this study provided a chatbot aid to SRL, providing immediate feedback to students on their questions and allowing them to reflect on the learning process, thereby increasing their motivation to learn, and facilitating their learning.

## Literature review

### Self-regulated learning

With the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, a growing body of research

## Technology-based Interactive Guidance to Promote Learning

SRL is theorized as a cyclical model; according to Zimmerman (1998), the SRL process comprises three cyclical phases that interact with each other. The first is the Forethought Phase, in which learners engage in task analysis, set goals, and create a plan at the outset (Honicke & Broadbent, 2016; Panadero, 2017). In the Performance Phase, learners move into the practical phase and execute their plans through self-control and self-observation. Each student has a degree of self-regulation, but it varies; the stronger the learner's internal motivation, the more active they are in learning, the more cognitively engaged they are, and the more self-regulated they are. The Self-Reflection phase, in which assessment and evaluation are important components and skills (Fraile et al., 2017), is when learners evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the program and the appropriateness of the strategies used (Kostons et al., 2012), reflecting on their goals and plans, and adapting learning strategies after the task has been carried out.

Previous research has shown that prompted reflection can enhance students' SRL, enhance the thread of reflection on learning outcomes, and is effective in terms of supporting students' SRL (Dent & Koenka, 2016; Devolder et al., 2012; Van et al., 2020). Butler and Winne (1995) proposed a model of SRL which describes how students regularly reflect on and receive external feedback, and found that teachers can support students in developing SRL skills by providing scaffolding for reflection (Bennett, 2011; Jonsson, 2013). Nicol and Macfarlane-Dick (2006) proposed formative assessment, using a rubric to determine student learning outcomes against which students can self-assess and reflect as a direction for continuous improvement (Leenknecht et al., 2021; Xiao & Yang, 2019).

Reflection is the process by which learners assess their progress in light of information obtained from monitoring during the practice phase and the feedback they receive during the self-regulation process (Yan & Brown, 2017). It is a form of mental processing that can be expressed in various ways, such as learning outcomes, methods of reflection, frequency, and duration of reflection, and peer and teacher feedback. Learners become aware of their weaknesses and strengths in their own learning and thinking processes, and find ways to compensate for them (Belski & Belski, 2014; Yan, 2020). This allows learners to reflect on their learning processes and understand the relevance of learning strategies to outcomes, which can help them to solve their learning problems (Kitsantas, 2002). Reflection is also a skill or strategy whereby learners reflect not only on what they have learned but also on how they learned it (Masui & De Corte, 2005; Panadero et al., 2016). In order to improve learning outcomes, when students encounter learning problems after reflection, teachers should guide students on where to find reliable resources to provide guidance and help them modify existing learning strategies to enhance their learning.

## Chatbot with Feedback

A chatbot is a software application. ELIZA, introduced in 1966, was an early and well-known chatbot developed by Joseph Weizenbaum for psychotherapy purposes. Its key technology is a natural language processing system that involves machine learning; when a user enters a word or phrase into a conversation with the chatbot, the user immediately receives a pre-programmed response and appropriate feedback which continues to drive a meaningful conversation (Epstein & Klinkenberg, 2001).

Over the past few decades, issues related to AI technologies and natural language processing (NLP) have been widely discussed and explored worldwide (Chen & Hsu, 2020; Lai & Tu, 2024; Tang et al., 2021). Chatbots have been used in many areas such as education (Fryer et al

## Research Questions

RQ2. Does using SRL-CGF enhance students' motivation, learning attitude, meta-cognition tendency, and SRL performance more than C-SRL?

RQ3. Does using SRL-CGF lead to better student reflection compared to C-SRL?

## Chatbot-assisted Self-regulated Learning Feedback System

The learning system was modified from Zimmerman and Moylan's (2009) three stages of SRL, as shown in Fig. 1, to form the learning environment for this study. The forethought phase involves students setting goals and planning strategies. The performance phase consists of taking practical action to achieve the task goals, choosing appropriate learning strategies for the content of the task, and the specific application of time management for implementation. Then the reflection and feedback phase comprises the chatbot feedback to facilitate reflection.

The TronClass system, a tool to support SRL and set learning goals, was added to support the chatbot's feedback with SRL. Students must set their learning goals, develop their learning strategies and evaluate their effectiveness. The user management system allows teachers to keep track of students' learning status and frequency of visits. In contrast, the online learning system provides students with learning content that enables them to learn independently according to their learning situation.

This study used Chatfuel to build different levels of feedback mechanisms for the chatbot. A total of three levels of feedback were designed:

- Level 1: Basic Knowledge Feedback
- Level 2: Advanced Knowledge Feedback
- Level 3: Expert Knowledge Feedback

### Level 1: Basic Knowledge Feedback

The Chatfuel development platform was used to build the chatbot. The development interface is shown in Fig. 2. The fundamental knowledge feedback content is at this level, as shown in Fig. 3. The content of the learning was divided into three modules:

1. "Basic setup unit (1)" with low knowledge difficulty, which includes:
   - Introduction to basic web modules setup
   - Introduction to structure modules
   - Introduction to media modules
2. "Introduction to Weebly Modules (1)" with medium knowledge difficulty
3. "Introduction to Weebly Modules (2)," which includes:
   - Introduction to the e-commerce module
   - Other modules
   - Backend settings
   - Marketing tools

Figure 4 shows the feedback screen of the website account and website design function for the basic setup module.

### Level 2: Advanced Knowledge Feedback

Advanced knowledge feedback content and inference mechanism, as shown in Fig. 5. The modules are:

1. "B+ (to be enhanced)" with a score of 70-80, including:
   - Introduction to basic website architecture
   - Basic graphic design
2. "A ~ A- (Basic)" with a score of 80-90, including:
   - Introduction to website case studies
   - Graphic design cases
3. "A (Advanced)" with a score of 90 or above, including:
   - Introduction to professional design works
   - Web design resources

Figure 6 shows the reflection feedback screen in Chatbot Feedback Level 2, and Fig. 7 shows the advanced knowledge feedback screen in Chatbot Feedback Level 2 for website case studies.

### Level 3: Expertise Feedback

Expertise feedback content and inference mechanism in Fig. 8. At this level, three modules depend on the level of proficiency of the content (i.e., website-building expertise):

1. "B+ (to be enhanced)" with a score of 70-80, including:
   - Introduction to basic color matching skills
   - Web design skills

## Experimental design

### Participants
This research used a quasi-experimental research method. The participants were two classes of sophomores who were taking a multimedia course at a university in northern Taiwan. Their average age was 22. One class was assigned to the experimental group (N = 23) using the chatbot-guided feedback mechanism to learn. The other class was the control group (N = 24) using conventional SRL. The same instructor, who had more than 5 years of teaching experience, taught the two groups.

### Instruments
The web design skill questionnaire from Khlaisang (2017) and Pallud and Straub (2014) was used to suggest the skills required for web design, including 30% for thematic website themes, 40% for complete website content planning, and 30% for website creativity and aesthetics; the Kappa was 0.90. Wang and Chen's (2010) motivation survey estimates students' motivation to learn. It consists of six items on a 5-point Likert scale, and the questionnaire has a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.79. In addition, we used Hwang et al.'s (2013) questionnaire to examine students' learning attitudes, which consisted of seven items on a 5-point Likert scale with a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.88. This questionnaire allowed us to identify student attitude changes before and after the learning activities. In addition, the self-regulation questionnaire by Barnard et al. (2009), which consists of 24 questions with six components, was administered on a 5-point Likert scale, with Cronbach's alpha values of 0.95, 0.92, 0.93, 0.87, 0.96 and 0.94. The overall Cronbach's alpha value of the questionnaire was 0.92, meaning that the scale has a high-reliability value. In addition, the questionnaire proposed by Kember et al. (2000) to examine students' reflective tendencies consisted of eight items on a 5-point Likert scale with an internal consistency Cronbach's alpha value of 0.90. We also used the questionnaire developed by Lai and Hwang (2014) to examine students' meta-cognition tendency; it consisted of five items on a 5-point Likert scale with a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.83.

At the end of the in-class activity, interviews were conducted to understand students' perceptions of the chatbot-assisted SRL. The interview questions were proposed by Hwang et al. (2009), and are listed as follows:

1. How does using chatbot-assisted SRL reflection differ from what you have previously experienced (or what you expected)? Does it work? Why or why not?
2. What advantages do you think this learning method has overall?
3. In which part do you think you achieved the most in this way? In which part did you learn the most? Please give concrete examples.
4. What can be improved about this approach (e.g., system features or interface design)? Please give specific examples.
5. Would you like to have the opportunity to learn in this way again in the future? What are the subjects? Why are these subjects appropriate?
6. Would you recommend this system or learning method to your classmates? Why do you think they need to learn in this way? Or would they prefer to learn in this way?
7. Would you recommend that teachers use this system or this way of teaching? Why do you think they need to teach in this way? Or would they prefer to teach in this way?

## Experimental Procedure

Before the investigation, both groups were tested for academic performance, motivation, attitude toward learning, self-regulated performance, reflection, and meta-cognition tendency. 

In the first week of the course, the teacher introduced the TronClass learning platform and the Coggle tool, and students completed a website architecture and set their own learning goals. In weeks 1-2, students were taught and practiced using the Weebly website creation tool; in weeks 2-5, they designed their first website and uploaded their work; in weeks 5-8, they did their second creative website activity. 

Three units of learning and reflection cycles were adopted. The control group gave reflection sheets, which the students filled in and submitted to the teacher, who provided feedback. The experimental group worked on the reflection with the chatbot, as shown in Table 1.

## Results

A quasi-experiment was conducted in this research, with the subject being the completion of design website works during 8 weeks of an Introduction to Multimedia course. The experimental group used SRL with a chatbot-guided feedback mechanism, while the control group used conventional SRL. After the experiment, a posttest was conducted to detect changes in learners' academic performance, learning motivation, learning attitude, SRL performance, reflection, and meta-cognition tendency. ANCOVA analysis and qualitative analysis were performed.

### Analysis of Learning Performance

ANCOVA was performed to examine the effects of the proposed approach on students' multimedia knowledge performance. The analysis results showed that the multimedia knowledge performance scores passed the regression coefficient homogeneity test (F = 1.136, p > 0.05) and so using ANCOVA was appropriate.

The ANCOVA result of the multimedia knowledge performance of the two groups showed a significant difference between the two groups after excluding the impact of the pretest scores (F = 5.46, p < 0.05). This indicates that the students who learned via the SRL with chatbot-guided feedback mechanism performed better than those who adopted conventional SRL.

### Analysis of Website Design Performance

On the multimedia pretest, the experimental group's mean score and standard deviation were 86.52 and 3.27, while those of the control group were 85.91 and 3.09. There was no significant difference between the pretest scores of the two groups after an independent t test (t = 0.65, p > 0.05). This implies that both groups had similar levels of multimedia production skills before learning to use the SRL with the chatbot-guided feedback mechanism.

## Technology-based interactive guidance to promote learning

To compare the differences in students' performance, we used a repeated measures ANOVA, as shown in Table 4, and the results revealed a significant interaction between the feedback method and website design performance with F(1, 45) = 6.54 (p = 0.01).

Furthermore, Table 5 shows the results of the analysis of the impact of learning methods on the learners' website design performance. There was no significant difference between the experimental and control groups in the first website entry results (F(1,45) = 0.43, p = 0.52), but there was a significant difference in the second website entry results (F(1,45) = 15.70, p < 0.001), and from the website results profile in Fig. 11, it can be seen that the experimental group had a greater slope compared to the control group. Therefore, it is inferred that students in the experimental group were able to generate meaningful and timely feedback from the chatbot compared to the control group. The students' thoughts and feelings interacted with the feedback, and they reflected on the learning actions they took, which improved their website production skills over time. This explains why they made more progress in their second website production results.

### Analysis of learning motivation

Learning motivation was analyzed using ANCOVA to determine the effects of the proposed approach on students' learning motivation. It was found that the assumption of homogeneity was not violated with (F = 0.631, p > 0.05), implying that the hypothesis of homogeneity of the regression coefficients was satisfied. Thus, ANCOVA could be directly employed.

The ANCOVA result of learning motivation for the two groups is shown in Table 6. The average learning motivation rating for the experimental group was 4.04, with a standard deviation of 0.41, while the average for the control group was 3.70, with a standard deviation of 0.71. The results of the analysis showed that after excluding the influence of the pretest questionnaire on learning motivation, the variance caused by the group reached a significant level (F = 4.10, p < 0.05), indicating that the scores of the posttest questionnaire on learning motivation differed significantly depending on the learning mode students adopted. The results showed that the SRL model based on the feedback mechanism of the chatbot significantly improved students' motivation.

### Analysis of learning attitude

ANCOVA was also employed to analyze the effects of the proposed approach on students' learning attitudes. It was found that the assumption of homogeneity was not violated with (F = 1.311, p > 0.05), implying that the hypothesis of homogeneity of the regression coefficients was satisfied. Thus, ANCOVA could be directly employed.

The ANCOVA result of learning attitude for the two groups is shown in Table 7. The average learning attitude rating for the experimental group was 4.12, with a standard deviation of 0.70, while the average for the control group was 4.11, with a standard deviation of 0.75. The analysis results showed that after excluding the influence of the pretest questionnaire on learning attitude, there was no significant difference between the two groups.

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

Technology-based interactive guidance to promote learning...

The results showed no difference in the learning attitudes of the two groups (F = 0.01, p > 0.05). Since the multimedia course is a required course, its structure and requirements may have influenced students' learning attitudes, resulting in no significant difference between the two groups. Therefore, even though the experimental group used the SRL-CGF for SRL, their learning attitudes still did not reach statistical significance compared to the control group using C-SRL.

## Analysis of meta-cognition tendency

Analysis of ANCOVA was also employed to analyze the effects of the proposed approach on students' meta-cognition tendency. It was found that the assumption of homogeneity was not violated with (F = 0.062, p > 0.05), implying that the hypothesis of homogeneity of the regression coefficients was satisfied. Thus, ANCOVA could be directly employed.

The ANCOVA result of meta-cognition tendency for the two groups is shown in Table 8. The average meta-cognition tendency rating for the experimental group was 3.96, with a standard deviation of 0.46, while the average for the control group was 3.68, with a standard deviation of 0.48. The results of the analysis show that after excluding the influence of the pretest questionnaire on meta-cognition tendency, the variance caused by the group reached a significant level (F = 4.25, p < 0.05), indicating that the scores of the posttest questionnaire on meta-cognition tendency differed significantly depending on the learning mode students adopted. The results showed that the SRL model based on the feedback mechanism of the chatbot significantly improved students' meta-cognition tendency.

## Analysis of self-regulated learning

ANCOVA was also employed to analyze the effects of the proposed approach on students' SRL. It was found that the assumption of homogeneity was not violated (F = 1.542, p > 0.05), implying that the hypothesis of homogeneity of the regression coefficients was satisfied. Thus, ANCOVA could be directly employed.

The ANCOVA result of SRL for the two groups is shown in Table 9. The average SRL rating for the experimental group was 3.95, with a standard deviation of 0.46, while the average for the control group was 3.71, with a standard deviation of 0.59. The results of the analysis showed that after excluding the influence of the pretest questionnaire on meta-cognition tendency, the variance caused by the group reached a significant level (F = 4.21, p < 0.05), indicating that the scores of the posttest questionnaire on SRL differed significantly depending on the learning mode students received. The results showed that the SRL model based on the feedback mechanism of the chatbot significantly improved students' SRL.

### Correlation analysis of website design performance, learning performance, learning motivation, learning attitude, self-regulated performance, reflection, and meta-cognition tendency

Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis was conducted to further understand the differences between the experimental and control groups. The data of the experimental group are shown in Table 11. The results showed that there was no significant correlation between the first work performance and learning performance, learning motivation, learning attitude, self-regulated performance, reflection, and meta-cognition tendency; there was, however, a significant correlation between the second work performance and learning motivation (r = 0.44, p < 0.05), learning attitude (r = 0.43, p < 0.05), and self-regulated performance (r = 0.45, p < 0.05). This indicates that students experienced cognitive transformations in the second round of feedback after the first chatbot feedback experience. This implies that meaningful feedback can produce responses in which students' reflections interact with the feedback information, and students then take learning actions (Bangert-Drowns et al., 1991).

In the control group analysis, as shown in Table 12, there were significant correlations between first work performance (r = 0.44, p < 0.05) and second work performance (r = 0.41, p < 0.015), with motivation to learn. However, there was no significant correlation between learning performance, learning attitude, self-regulated performance, reflection, and postulated cognitive perception tendency.

### Qualitative analysis of students' perceptions

Table 13 shows the analysis results of the interviews, which were conducted with the 23 students from the experimental group. Responses were categorized into the three themes of "providing personalized self-directed learning opportunities," "promoting reflective skills," and "improving learning performance," as well as the coded items and the number of occurrences. Regarding "providing opportunities for personalized self-directed learning," E03 reported: I can flexibly adjust my learning content and progress. E01 reported: I can review my learning and repeat the learning materials. E27 said: I can get a reply in real time, and I am not limited by time and place for learning. Therefore, with a SRL model based on the chatbot feedback mechanism, students could develop SRL, which helped to increase their commitment to learning.

In terms of "facilitating the ability to reflect," E35 said: It is convenient to understand the quick suggestions. It lets me reflect on it. E005 mentioned that it is more valuable, and he could point out the problematic points more directly. In addition, E14 said it could provide information, give guidance, and facilitate reflection on problems. This suggests that students could understand website creation by using the SRL model of the chatbot feedback mechanism, which could encourage their thinking and help them accomplish their learning goals.

Regarding "improving learning performance," students also mentioned the advantages of using the SRL mode with the chatbot feedback mechanism. E08 reported that it often requires a great deal of time to find the direction or data, and that it is possible to use the chatbot to get the information faster, while E42 reported that progress is planned more efficiently, and answers are available immediately. In addition, E11 said it felt like having a tutor to teach step-by-step, so it was easy to get started quickly. Therefore, the feedback from the chatbot could stimulate students to think more profoundly and organize their knowledge.

### Discussion and conclusions

The purpose of this study was to propose SRL with a chatbot-guided feedback mechanism. In an 8-week multimedia course, in addition to the support of the SRL learning system, the chatbot provided feedback that we expected to help students benefit from the SRL learning process based on the chatbot feedback mechanism. Previous research has shown the importance of monitoring and responding to SRL in general technology-assisted SRL (Bui & Loebbecke, 1996), but due to the large number of students that the teacher has to deal with, it is not possible to give immediate feedback and advice to individual

## Technology-based interactive guidance to promote learning

This study developed an SRL learning model based on a chatbot feedback mechanism to foster students' self-regulation in learning reflection and academic performance. The experimental group learned using the SRL model based on the chatbot feedback mechanism, while the control group learned using the general SRL model. From the difference in students' performance in individual website works, the results in Table 5 show no significant difference between the experimental and control groups in the first website works performance (F (1,45) = 0.43, p = 0.52). However, there was a significant difference in the second website works performance (F (1,45) = 15.70, p < 0.001), and from the website works performance profile in Figs. 5–1, it can be seen that the experimental group had a greater slope and made more progress in the second website work score. Therefore, it is inferred that students in the experimental group improved their website production, influenced by the chatbot providing timely feedback and convenience, and the number and duration of reflections helped the students to be aware of their weaknesses and solve problems in their learning and thinking process (Belski & Belski, 2014; Yan, 2020); more progress was made in the second website works.

From the results of the experimental group in Table 11, there was no significant correlation between first work performance and learning performance, motivation, learning attitudes, SRL performance, reflection, and meta-cognition tendency. However, there was a significant correlation between second work performance and learning performance, motivation, learning attitudes, SRL performance, reflection, and meta-cognition tendency. This showed timely and meaningful feedback that can produce an adequate response. Students' thoughts interact with feedback, and students act on learning after reflection (Bangert-Drowns et al., 1991). In other words, after the first chatbot feedback experience, students reflected on the second round of feedback to produce cognitive changes that allowed them to understand the problem and how to solve it so that they performed better in terms of work performance, motivation, and self-regulation. More evidence can be found in the results of the interviews. For example, students reported that it provided information, gave guidance, and facilitated thinking about problems. This suggests that students can understand website production through the SRL mode of the chatbot feedback mechanism, which can encourage their thinking and help them accomplish their learning goals.

On the other hand, this study has some limitations that need to be noted. Because we included only university students, we suggest that future studies investigate more students at different educational levels, including their SRL activities and satisfaction with SRL with a chatbot-guided feedback mechanism. In addition, the effectiveness of the chatbot-guided feedback mechanism may be due to the novelty effect, as students had little previous experience with it. A short-term study design is susceptible to the novelty effect, whereby participants initially exhibit higher learning motivation and engagement due to excitement about new technology or learning methods. However, this effect may diminish over time and may not lead to sustained learning improvements. Therefore, future research should consider longer-term follow-up studies to assess the durability of the novelty effect and its actual impact on learning outcomes (Rodrigues et al., 2022).
