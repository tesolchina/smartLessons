## Abstract

This study aimed to explore English as a foreign language (EFL) students' use of self-made retrieval augmented generation (RAG) chatbots to enhance their learning to write. In the study, 69 Chinese undergraduate students participated in a workshop focused on creating chatbots, using Poe, that can assist with their writing processes. Multiple data sources were collected, including chatbots built by students, essays students wrote using their chatbots, students' responses to pre- and post-workshop questionnaires, and written reflections. The findings revealed that students developed chatbots for various purposes, such as assisting with idea generation, producing writing outlines, and identifying grammatical and spelling errors. Students made various requests, including assistance, customization, and translation, during their interactions with chatbots. Moreover, the use of self-made chatbots had a positive impact on students' writing motivation. It resulted in clearer writing goals, increased writing confidence, reinforced writing beliefs, and a more positive attitude towards writing. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of chatbots as pedagogical tools that enhance personalized language learning for students. By leveraging self-made chatbots, students can receive tailored support for their specific writing needs, leading to improved motivation.

## 1. Introduction

Personalized learning is an educational approach that tailors instruction and learning experiences to meet the individual needs, interests, and abilities of each student (Klaˇsnja-Mili´cevi´c et al., 2011). It recognizes that students have unique learning styles, preferences, and strengths, and aims to provide customized learning pathways to maximize their educational outcomes. Personalized learning goes beyond a one-size-fits-all approach and takes into account factors such as students' prior knowledge, learning pace, and specific learning goals. It may involve utilizing adaptive technologies (Slavuj et al., 2017), individualized goal-setting (Jansen et al., 2024), flexible grouping (McGillicuddy, 2021), and differentiated instruction (Boelens et al., 2018) to create a more personalized and tailored learning experience for each student. Research has shown that personalized learning approaches can significantly enhance student engagement, motivation, and achievement by ensuring that learning experiences are relevant, meaningful, and aligned with each individual learner's needs (Barker, 2007; Chen & Chung, 2008; Huang, Yu, et al., 2023; P´erez-Segura et al., 2022). Notably, studies have delved into the use of various educational technologies to support personalized language learning among students (Chen & Chung, 2008; Hsu et al., 2013; Ko, 2022). Furthermore, as suggested by Xie et al. (2019), the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has opened up new avenues and expanded possibilities for technology-enhanced personalized learning.

## Using LLMs for Writing Support and Motivation

(2023) explored the learning outcomes and perceptions of university EFL students who received writing feedback generated by ChatGPT. The results indicated that, compared to feedback from human tutors, the use of ChatGPT feedback did not yield significant differences in learning outcomes. Furthermore, the study revealed that students were nearly equally divided in their preference for ChatGPT-generated or human-generated feedback.

The use of LLM-based chatbots not only influences students' writing skills but also has an impact on their writing motivation (Song & Song, 2023; Yan, 2023). Writing motivation plays a crucial role in driving students to actively participate in writing activities and maintain their dedication to writing tasks, ultimately leading to improved outcomes (Bruning & Horn, 2000). It can be influenced by both external social and situational factors, as well as internal cognitive and affective factors (Ling et al., 2021). Previous studies on writing motivation have explored various aspects, with considerable research focusing on self-efficacy, which refers to individuals' confidence in their ability to accomplish specific tasks (Bandura, 1997). Achievement goal theory (Elliot & Church, 1997; Pintrich, 2000) has also been employed to study writing motivation. Furthermore, research has examined the impact of students' beliefs regarding the key aspects of effective writing (Wright et al., 2019).

Considering the use of LLM-based technologies, the influence on students' writing motivation should be acknowledged. For instance, LLM-based technologies could affect student writers' self-efficacy as they may feel more confident in their ability to generate high-quality content with AI assistance. Conversely, if AI-generated content is perceived as superior or more appealing to audiences, students may experience a decline in confidence, leading to self-doubt about their writing abilities. LLM-based technologies also have the potential to shape writing goals by offering new possibilities and challenges. On one hand, students may set higher goals by envisioning the use of LLM-based technologies to create more sophisticated and innovative content. On the other hand, students might feel overwhelmed or intimidated by the capabilities of LLM-based technologies, causing a shift in their goals. The complex relationship between LLM-based technologies and writing motivation emphasizes the ongoing need for research.

### Using customized chatbots for personalized learning

Using chatbots as learning companions has emerged as a popular pedagogical approach for personalized learning. While many studies have adopted commercial chatbots like ChatGPT (e.g., Su et al., 2023) and Alexa (e.g., Dizon, 2020) to support students' language learning, some researchers have developed customized chatbots tailored to specific educational purposes. These chatbots are often designed and developed by the researchers themselves. For example, Guo et al. (2022) developed a chatbot named Argumate, designed to assist students in constructing arguments and writing argumentative essays. Argumate provides two important scaffolds: suggesting ideas to support students' opinions and exposing them to opposing ideas. Zhang et al. (2023b) created a chatbot for out-of-class, self-regulated training on logical fallacies in EFL argumentative writing. Liu et al. (2022) developed an AI-enabled chatbot with a basic understanding of 157 books, enabling it to provide book discussions and social-affective cues to facilitate students' engagement in book talks and sustain their interest in reading. Hsu et al. (2023) developed an interactive chatbot system named TPBOT (TOEIC Practice Chatbot) for EFL learners to overcome their fear of speaking English and practice spoken English with chatbots at any time. Fathi et al. (2024) employed an AI-mediated chatbot called Andy English Chatbot, which was designed to aid language learners in practicing their speaking skills. This chatbot simulated conversations with native English speakers and provided feedback and corrections on EFL learners' pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.

Generative AI technologies have the potential to transform learning experiences by providing personalized and interactive tools for students. However, LLMs face challenges such as lack of contextual information, outdated knowledge, and untraceable reasoning processes (Huang, Yu, et al., 2023; Kandpal et al., 2023). These limitations highlight the impracticality of deploying LLMs as black-box solutions in real-world production environments without implementing additional safeguards (Gao et al., 2023). Consequently, these shortcomings can impede the effectiveness of LLM-based chatbots in supporting students' writing learning. For example, the lack of contextual information means that chatbots may struggle to understand the specific context and nuances of a writing task, leading to potential inaccuracies or inappropriate suggestions. Additionally, chatbots may rely on outdated knowledge, as their training data has a cutoff date and may not incorporate the latest information or developments. This can result in incorrect or obsolete recommendations being provided to students. Furthermore, the untraceable reasoning processes of chatbots pose a challenge. Students may receive suggestions or feedback from chatbots, but they are often unable to trace the underlying reasoning or understand the logic behind the suggestions. This lack of transparency can hinder students' ability to learn and improve their writing skills effectively.

To address these limitations, researchers have introduced RAG, a promising solution that incorporates knowledge from external databases (Lewis et al., 2020). RAG involves two steps: an initial retrieval phase where the LLMs query an external data source to gather relevant information, followed by the generation phase where the retrieved evidence informs the text generation process (Gao et al., 2023). This approach significantly enhances the accuracy and relevance of the output by grounding responses in retrieved evidence. RAG's dynamic retrieval of information from knowledge bases during the inference phase helps mitigate issues like generating factually incorrect content, often referred to as "hallucinations" (Shuster et al., 2021). This integration of RAG into LLMs has gained rapid adoption, becoming a pivotal technology in refining chatbot capabilities and making LLMs more practical for real-world applications (Cai et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2020). This holds great promise for enhancing students' learning experiences by providing more accurate and contextually relevant support. However, despite the increasing number of studies exploring the potential of LLMs in enhancing teaching and learning since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 (for reviews, see Lo, 2023; Montenegro-Rueda et al., 2023; Rahman & Watanobe, 2023), limited research has thus far explored the application of RAG-enabled chatbots in educational settings.

In the current AI-driven era, it is crucial for students to acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to effectively utilize AI technologies in their learning and future careers. With the introduction of RAG techniques and the availability of AI-empowered chatbot creation platforms like Poe, students now have the opportunity to create their own chatbots tailored to their individual learning needs, facilitating personalized learning experiences. However, there is still a lack of understanding regarding how students create RAG chatbots and how the utilization of such chatbots influences their learning. Consequently, this study aims to bridge this gap by investigating students' creation and use of self-made RAG chatbots in the context of EFL writing. Specifically, the study seeks to address the following research questions (RQs):

- RQ1: What purposes do students have when they create their own RAG chatbots to support their writing?
- RQ2: How do students engage with their self-made RAG chatbots during the writing process?
- RQ3: How does writing with self-made RAG chatbots impact students' writing motivation?

## Methods

### Participants and context

The study was conducted at a comprehensive university in China that employs English as the medium of instruction

## Creating and Using Personalized Chatbots for Argumentative Writing

## Workshop Design and Implementation

### Needs Identification
Students completed a worksheet to reflect on their experiences with writing argumentative essays. The worksheet prompted them to consider challenges in various aspects including generating ideas, organizing thoughts, using evidence, structuring paragraphs, and addressing counterarguments. Instructors provided guidance to help students understand the self-assessment process and draw insights from past experiences, feedback, and observations.

### Teacher Instruction
The instructor demonstrated chatbot creation on Poe, focusing on prompt engineering training through three steps:
1. Selecting a chatbot persona and formulating prompts using second person perspective
2. Crafting prompts to guide the LLM
3. Exploring knowledge base customization and resource incorporation

### Chatbot Creation
Students developed their own chatbots by:
- Designing chatbot names, prompts, greeting messages, and objectives
- Uploading knowledge base files
- Incorporating relevant resources

### Chatbot Implementation
Students used their personalized chatbots for an argumentative writing task adapted from GRE's 'Analyze an Issue' task. They had 30 minutes to write a 300-word essay on the following issue:

> Some people believe it is often necessary, even desirable, for political leaders to withhold information from the public. Others believe that the public has a right to be fully informed.

Students annotated sections where they received chatbot assistance.

### Student Reflection
Students wrote reflections addressing two questions:
1. In what aspects can your self-made chatbot assist you in completing the argumentative writing task?
2. What are the advantages of your self-made chatbots compared to existing chatbots in enhancing your argumentative writing?

## Ethical Considerations

The workshop addressed several ethical concerns:
- Copyright compliance: Students were instructed on intellectual property rights and fair use guidelines
- Privacy protection: Guidelines were provided to avoid uploading personal or sensitive information
- Resource usage: Students were advised to use only publicly available or properly licensed resources

## System 124 (2024) 103362

## 3.3. Data collection and analysis

Multiple data sources were collected in this study to address the three RQs, including students' completed worksheets, self-made chatbots, chat histories with chatbots, argumentative essays, written reflections, and questionnaire responses (see Table 1).

### 3.3.1. For addressing RQ1 (students' purposes for creating chatbots)

To answer RQ1, we collected the students' self-identified challenges in argumentative writing in the initial phase (needs identification) of the workshop and the details of their self-made chatbots, including chatbot names, objectives, prompts, and knowledge base files. These two datasets were used to understand the students' purposes for creating chatbots to tackle their challenges in argumentative writing.

We carried out a content analysis (Dörnyei, 2007; Evans, 2017) to classify the expected scaffoldings provided by the students' self-made chatbots, which were then categorized, in accordance with Su et al.'s (2023) proposed process-based approach to examining LLM-based-chatbot-assisted argumentative writing, into four stages: preparation, editing, proofreading, and reflection. To ensure coding reliability, the first and second authors studied the coding scheme together and then coded 18 students' worksheets and chatbot information independently (25% of the data). The inter-coder agreement was over 95%. The two coders discussed their coding until they reached final agreement. Then, the two authors each coded half of the remaining data independently.

Finally, for each chatbot creation purpose, the number of students who created a chatbot for that particular purpose was recorded. If a chatbot was created for two or more purposes, the number of students who created the chatbot was counted separately for each purpose. Additionally, the percentage of students was calculated based on the total of the 69 students.

### 3.3.2. For addressing RQ2 (students' engagement with their chatbots in the writing process)

To investigate RQ2, we examined the chat histories between the students and their chatbots to gain insights into their interactions during the writing process. The analysis was conducted at the level of single-turn conversations, where each exchange between a student's message and their chatbot's response was treated as a unit of analysis. In total, we identified 364 conversation units.

Informed by Han et al.'s (2023) study on student-ChatGPT dialogue patterns, we identified three main categories of requests which students employed when seeking help and engaging with their chatbots. These categories were as follows:

1. Request for assistance: obtaining assistance to address students' challenges during the writing process; this category included three subcategories, namely request for information, request for evaluation, and request for revision; for their definitions, see Appendix A.
2. Request for customization: pursuing tailored responses aligned with students' requirements; this category included four subcategories, namely customization of response scope, customization of response format, customization of response credibility, and customization of response relevance; for their definitions, see Appendix A.
3. Request for translation: seeking translation services, usually involving translating Chinese into English.

Considering the dialogic nature of the chat histories, the analysis of each conversation unit incorporated the context to identify the underlying request. For instance, student 67's inquiry, "What grammatical errors did you correct? Could you highlight the details by using the bold font?", was categorized as a request for customization of response format, rather than a request for revision.

Table 1. Data sources and purposes

| Data source | Purpose | Related RQ |
|-------------|----------|------------|
| 1. Student worksheets (self-identified challenges in argumentative writing) | To understand the students' challenges in argumentative writing and their purposes for creating chatbots | RQ1 |
| 2. Students' self-made chatbots (prompts and knowledge base files) | To understand the students' purposes

## What purposes do students have when they create their own RAG chatbots to support their writing? (RQ1)

In consideration of their individual challenges in argumentative writing, the students developed their own chatbots for seven distinct purposes (see Table 2). Regarding the first stage of preparation, a significant number of students (23 students; 33%) identified difficulties in crafting clear thesis statements and compelling subclaims. In response, they created chatbots specifically for idea generation (purpose 1). For instance, student 25 designed a chatbot named "Issue Idea Generator" with the following prompt:

> You are an expert in generating and improving ideas in GRE issue essays. You are going to assist the user in writing subclaims by providing ideas for a specific argument. Please refer to the GRE issue essay scoring rubrics (especially the rubric for "quality of ideas") to generate appropriate, insightful, and innovative ideas.

The chatbot's knowledge base was enriched by integrating the GRE scoring rubrics, specifically focusing on the rubric for "quality of ideas." This integration aimed to tackle the student's difficulties in generating high-quality ideas. In addition to scoring rubrics, some students uploaded their course materials (PowerPoint slides) as an external knowledge base, which covered effective techniques.

### For addressing RQ3 (impact of using self-made RAG chatbots on students' writing motivation)

To address RQ3, participants were required to complete pre- and post-workshop questionnaires (see Appendix B) to examine any changes in their writing motivation resulting from the chatbot-assisted writing experience. The questionnaire was adapted from Ling et al. (2021). We employed Ling et al.'s (2021) instrument because it was developed specifically for assessing the self-judgment of undergraduate students regarding their writing motivation. Since our study focused on undergraduate students, we found this instrument to be particularly relevant to our research context.

The questionnaire consisted of four components, which assessed different aspects of writing motivation:
1. Writing goals (the aims or objectives individuals have regarding their writing)
2. Writing confidence (or self-efficacy) (individuals' perception of their capability to accomplish writing-related goals and overcome writing challenges)
3. Writing beliefs (individuals' beliefs about writing)
4. Writing affect (individuals' emotional experiences and attitudes towards writing)

The writing goals scale comprised 11 items, rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (does not describe me at all) to 5 (describes me very well). This scale examined three goal orientations related to learning to write:
- Mastery goals (4 items) focus on the development of knowledge and competence in writing (e.g., "When I am writing, I am trying to improve how I express my ideas.")
- Performance goals (3 items) refer to the desire to appear competent compared to others ("When I am writing, I am trying to be a better writer than my classmates.")
- Avoidance goals (4 items) capture efforts to avoid unfavorable judgments from others (e.g., "When I am writing, I am trying to avoid making mistakes in front of my classmates.")

The writing confidence (self-efficacy) scale consisted of 22 items (e.g., "I can think of a lot of ideas for my writing."), with responses given on a 5-point scale reflecting varying levels of confidence, from 1 (no chance) to 5 (completely sure).

The writing beliefs scale included 12 items, with responses recorded on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). This scale assessed beliefs about:
- Content (idea clarification and discovery; 6 items; e.g., "Writing helps make my ideas clearer.")
- Conventions (grammar, spelling, and fluency; 6 items; e.g., "Good writers do not make errors in spelling.")

The feelings about writing (affect) scale encompassed 5 items (e.

for brainstorming and topic analysis, in order to enhance the personalized guidance and support provided by their chatbots. Additionally, 13 students (19%) developed chatbots with a focus on idea organization (purpose 2), such as "Structural Coach Bot" (student 53). These chatbots were designed to aid students in their argumentative writing by providing structural assistance to organize ideas, ensuring a smooth logical flow of subclaims and assisting with the overall structure of their arguments. To align with the expected structure standards for the GRE issue essay, some students uploaded sample essays sourced from the web as their chatbots' external knowledge base.

Regarding the second stage of editing, 14 students (20%) developed chatbots with the purpose of enhancing the logical progression of their argumentation (purpose 3). Notable examples included "Logic Coherent Bot" (student 11) and "Logic Check Improve" (student 47). In contrast to chatbots focused on general structural assistance (purpose 2), purpose 3 chatbots targeted the flow and coherence of specific ideas within the essay. This involved establishing connections between logical premises and supporting evidence, as well as ensuring the coherent development of supporting evidence. To bolster the effectiveness of their chatbots, students drew upon various sources on logical coherence. These sources included student handouts from previous English language courses and extracurricular materials. For instance, student 47 uploaded a book titled "Minto Pyramid Principle: Logic in Writing, Thinking, and Problem Solving" as an external knowledge base to enhance his chatbot's ability to offer techniques for logical progression. This book, renowned as the McKinsey Firm standard, provides practical guidelines for organizing information in a logical and hierarchical manner.

Furthermore, 19 students (28%) built chatbots related to evidence use (purpose 4), such as "Evidence Synthesizer Bot" (student 6) and "Evidence Helper" (student 64). These chatbots were designed to assist students to select evidence from credible sources, synthesize the evidence to support subclaims, elaborate on the evidence with adequate details, and justify how the evidence could support the claim. Sample essays were usually uploaded as the knowledge base to instruct the chatbots to provide GRE-defined high-quality evidence use.

Regarding the third stage of proofreading, 19 students (28%) expressed inclination towards enhancing their writing style (purpose 5), focusing particularly on lexical choice and sentence structure. Additionally, 6 participants (9%) suggested their need for error correction (purpose 6), including aspects such as grammar and punctuation. In response to these requirements, chatbots were developed, bearing names such as "Vocabulary Richness" (student 28) and "Grammar Guardian Bot" (student 51). The students uploaded relevant knowledge base materials, primarily consisting of files obtained from the web designed to refine word choice and sentence structure in argumentative writing, to enhance the customization of their chatbots. For instance, one of the files elucidated its purpose as follows:

> This file can help you revise your papers for word-level clarity, eliminate wordiness and avoid clichés, find the words that best express your ideas, and choose words that suit an academic audience.

Notably, no explicit grammar-related materials were used as external knowledge bases by the students.

Regarding the last stage of reflection, 17 students (23%) created chatbots, such as "Arg Essay Assessor" (student 33) and "GRE Score Improver" (student 60), to support their essay evaluation (purpose 7). GRE scoring rubrics were primarily used as the external knowledge base, which allowed the chatbots to provide feedback and suggestions that were congruent with the expectations and

| Type of resources | No. of students | Percentage |
|-------------------|-----------------|------------|
| GRE-related materials | | |
| Scoring rubrics | 64 | 92.75% |
| Sample essays | 20 | 28.

> You are an experienced English teacher with years of GRE assessment experience. You are going to use "GRE issue essay scoring rubrics.docx" to assess students' writing. Please refer to the assessing rubrics. Please provide an overall score of the essay, provide four scores related to the four dimensions and provide some suggestions to improve the essay. Use positive tones.

This personalized approach facilitated a self-reflective process for students, enabling them to gauge their performance against established evaluation dimensions and make targeted improvements in their writing skills.

As mentioned above, the students integrated various files and resources into their self-made chatbots as an external knowledge base to improve their chatbots' performance. Here, we provide a summary of these files and resources. As shown in Table 3, the majority of students primarily utilized GRE-related materials. Specifically, 64 students (92.75%) incorporated the scoring rubrics used for assessing the argumentative writing task, while 20 students (28.99%) employed sample essays sourced from the web. The use of these materials was driven by the specific writing task employed in the study, as students wanted their chatbots to generate responses that met the expectations and requirements of the task. In addition to GRE-related materials, the students also integrated course materials into their chatbots' knowledge base. This included the instructor's PowerPoint slides (18 students; 26.09%), the course syllabus (4 students; 5.80%), and student handouts (8 students; 11.59%). These materials provided the chatbots with the specific learning context of the students, including the instructor's expectations for writing performance and the students' current writing proficiency. By incorporating this information, the chatbots could offer more tailored assistance. Finally, some students collected extracurricular materials, such as writing guides from educational websites (16 students; 23.19%) and books (3 students; 4.35%), which they uploaded to their chatbots' knowledge base, offering additional reference materials.

## How do students engage with their self-made RAG chatbots during the writing process? (RQ2)

As presented in Table 4, the students made 310 requests for assistance (77.89%), 82 requests for customization (20.60%), and 6 requests for translation (1.51%) during their interaction with their chatbots.

The first main category of request for assistance was divided into three subcategories. Firstly, within the subcategory of request for information, the students actively sought information pertaining to four critical aspects of argumentative writing: idea generation, idea organization, logical progression, and evidence use. Examples of each aspect are provided below:

- Please give me some ideas for this topic, including counter-argument, instead of directly providing the essay you write. (requesting information for idea generation; student 21)
- What kind of argument structure should I choose? (requesting information for idea organization; student 49)
- Can you give more reasons to support the idea that transparency is necessary? (requesting information for logical progression; student 35)
- Please give me some examples regarding withholding information from the public and undermining trust in political leaders and institutions. (requesting information for evidence use; student 64)

These specific areas of inquiry directly aligned with their needs to develop personalized chatbots for argumentative writing. This subcategory showcased the highest volume of requests, reaching a total of 174 (43.72%).

The second and third subcategories, namely request for evaluation and request for revision, were closely related, with the participants demonstrating greater emphasis on the latter. This was evident from the number of requests utilized, with 46 requests (11.56%) attributed to the former and a higher count of 90 requests (22.61%) directed towards the latter. The subcategory of request for evaluation entailed an assessment of essays, with a particular focus on evaluating and critiquing the content, organization, and language aspects, which were often accompanied by assigned scores. The subcategory of request

## Request Types for Chatbot Interaction

The second main category of request for customization involved requests made by the students to further customize their chatbots' output. It included several subcategories:

### Customization of Response Scope
(54 requests; 13.57%) Two scope adjustments were observed:
- Scope expansion: Participants seeking broader information or resources, including requesting further explanations and additional information
- Scope specification: Participants providing specific requirements, including expected detail level, particular focus points, and user identification

### Customization of Response Format
(14 requests; 3.52%) Students expressed preferences for presentation style, including:
- Bullet points
- Bold or italicized text
- Word count specifications

### Customization of Response Credibility
(8 requests; 2.01%) Students refined prompts to ensure information quality through three approaches:
1. Reasoning coherence: Ensuring structured and cohesive information presentation
2. Objectivity: Presenting unbiased and balanced information
3. Language appropriateness: Maintaining suitable academic language

### Customization of Response Relevance
(6 requests; 1.51%) Students requested information directly applicable to their specific needs or context, ensuring chatbots referred to provided knowledge bases.

### Request for Translation
(6 requests; 1.51%) Focused primarily on Chinese to English translation services.

### Writing Motivation Results

## How does writing with self-made RAG chatbots impact students' writing motivation? (RQ3)

To answer RQ3, we used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to evaluate the results of the pre- and post-workshop questionnaires. As shown in Table 5, among the seven sub-dimensions of writing motivation, the students had significantly higher levels (p < 0.05) of performance goal (z = 4.089; p = 0.000; r = 0.348), avoidance goal (z = 2.886; p = 0.004; r = 0.246), writing confidence (z = 6.447; p = 0.000; r = 0.549), writing beliefs in the importance of content (z = 2.945; p = 0.003; r = 0.251), writing beliefs in the importance of conventions (z = 4.668; p = 0.000; r = 0.397), and writing affect (z = 3.996; p = 0.000; r = 0.340) when writing with their self-made chatbots than when writing without their self-made chatbots. However, no significant differences were found in the sub-dimension of mastery goal (z = 1.531; p = 0.126; r = 0.130) between the two conditions.

## Discussion and conclusion

### Major findings

This study examined how EFL students created and utilized RAG chatbots to support their personalized learning of argumentative writing. The results demonstrated that students built RAG chatbots to address individual challenges at different stages of the writing process, including preparation, editing, proofreading, and reflection. Notably, the majority of students focused on using chatbots to generate ideas and construct arguments, while a smaller number built chatbots for language error correction. This preference could be attributed to the students' relatively high English language proficiency. Due to their proficiency in language usage, the students placed greater emphasis on the content aspect of argumentative writing. To improve the performance of their chatbots, students used various sources of information, such as grading rubrics, course materials, and online resources, to enhance the knowledge bases of their chatbots.

These findings align with the study by Su et al. (2023), highlighting the value of LLM-based chatbots in supporting students' argumentative writing across various stages. Importantly, the wide range of purposes for which students created chatbots highlights the benefits of empowering students to develop their own chatbots for learning. Since students face different writing challenges, providing them with the opportunity to create personalized chatbots ensures that the tools cater to their specific needs. The participating students captured this sentiment in their written reflections. For example, student 24 stated that, "For me, the self-created chatbot was a game-changer in my writing process. It allowed me to identify and address my weaknesses more effectively. The chatbot was customized to provide specific feedback and strategies for improving my reasoning, which was an area I struggled with. With the chatbot's assistance, I noticed a significant improvement in the clarity and persuasiveness of my writing." This customization approach enhances the effectiveness and relevance of chatbots in supporting individual students' writing processes.

In addition to exploring students' purposes for creating writing chatbots, this study investigated their engagement with their self-made chatbots during the writing process. It was found that students made various requests to generate output from their chatbots. The most frequently made request category, request for assistance, served as the foundation for addressing the students' challenges throughout the writing process. This category encompassed different forms of assistance-seeking, including requests for information, evaluation, and revision. When facing challenges in obtaining suitable assistance within the first category, students turned to the second category, request for customization. This involved seeking personalized responses aligned with their specific needs. Customization requests included adjusting the response scope, format, credibility, and relevance. By requesting customization, students were able to refine

## 5.2. Implications

This finding contrasts with the study conducted by Zhang et al. (2023b), which indicated a decrease in students' writing self-efficacy following their exposure to learning to write argumentative essays with chatbots. In addition, the utilization of self-made chatbots also bolstered students' beliefs regarding the significance of both content and conventions in argumentative writing. Lastly, students' attitudes toward writing became more favorable subsequent to their experience with self-made chatbots. This finding aligns with previous studies, including those conducted by Zhang et al. (2023a) and Guo et al. (2023), which have also demonstrated the positive effects of incorporating chatbots into EFL students' learning on their learning motivation.

### 5.2. Implications

Our findings contribute to the literature on chatbot-supported language learning and AI in education. Specifically, the study highlights the potential of students creating their own chatbots to support their personalized learning needs. This has significant implications for education as it empowers students to take ownership of their learning journey. By designing chatbots that align with their specific learning goals and preferences, students can enhance their engagement and motivation, leading to more effective learning outcomes. Furthermore, this study offers insights into the application of RAG techniques in language classrooms. RAG combines the advantages of retrieval models and generative models, allowing for the creation of contextually appropriate and tailored responses. Understanding how RAG techniques can be effectively utilized in language instruction can inform the design and implementation of language learning tools and resources.

Our findings also have practical implications. Specifically, the study opens up possibilities for the development of innovative pedagogical methods. By integrating students' self-made chatbots into language classrooms, educators can provide students with personalized language learning support. The interactive nature of chatbots can offer students opportunities for authentic language practice, instant feedback, and targeted language instruction, leading to improved language proficiency and fluency. Teachers are encouraged to inform their students about the potential role of chatbots in assisting with various stages of the writing process. By sharing the findings of this study, particularly the strategies employed by students to generate output from chatbots and implement RAG techniques to build customized chatbots, teachers can guide students on effectively interacting with these tools. This guidance will empower students to make the most of their chatbot interactions and harness the benefits provided by these personalized language learning aids. Additionally, the study highlights the importance of improving students' AI literacy, particularly in terms of critical and ethical use of AI (Ng et al., 2021). As students engage in creating and utilizing chatbots, they need to develop an understanding of the limitations and implications of AI technologies. Educators should prioritize teaching students how to critically evaluate and assess the information generated by chatbots, as well as promoting ethical considerations such as privacy, bias, and fairness in AI systems.

### 5.3. Limitations and future research

This study has several limitations that offer opportunities for future research in this area. Firstly, the absence of a control group in this study is a limitation. Future studies could employ an experimental design that includes a control group of students who either use teacher-made chatbots or engage in writing practices without the assistance of any chatbots. Such studies would provide robust empirical evidence regarding the effects of using students' self-made chatbots. Moreover, researchers may consider adopting a within-subject comparison design for further investigations. This design would involve students using both existing chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT) and their self-created RAG chatbots, allowing for a direct comparison of the two types of chatbots in supporting writing tasks. This approach would provide additional insights into the specific effects of RAG chatbots on students' writing learning.

Secondly, the intervention duration in this study was relatively short, consisting of only a 1.5-h workshop where students utilized their self-made chatbots for a single writing task. Future studies could involve students in multiple chatbot-assisted writing tasks over an extended period of time. Longitudinal studies of this nature would yield valuable insights into students
