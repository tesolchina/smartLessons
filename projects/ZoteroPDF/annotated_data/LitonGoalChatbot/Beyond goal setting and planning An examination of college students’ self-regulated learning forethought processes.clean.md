## Abstract

This study aimed to identify and evaluate major processes college students engage in as they begin their active engagement in learning. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 23 college students. Then, a grounded theory approach was used to identify the forethought processes students described. These processes included identifying goals, ordering and prioritizing tasks, scheduling, storing goals and plans, and regulating goals and plans. Additionally, findings indicated that students perceived their engagement in these forethought processes as connected to their beliefs about the subject domain, prior experiences, and subject domain and context. These results highlight processes that have not been thoroughly captured previously by self-regulated learning frameworks. Thus, articulating these processes provides a deeper understanding of students' active engagement in self-regulated learning.

## Introduction

The independence and new responsibilities students gain as they transition to college require the development of active learning strategies (Terenzini et al., 1994; Yazedjian et al., 2008). One way of conceptualizing students' active learning is through self-regulated learning (SRL) frameworks. SRL frameworks include a series of phases and processes that outline when and how students actively engage in academics (Boekaerts, 1997; Efklides, 2011; Pintrich, 2004; Winne & Hadwin, 1998; Zimmerman, 2000). Most frameworks tend to include at least three different phases: a forethought phase that occurs as students begin to initiate work on academic tasks, a performance phase that occurs while students are actively engaged in a task, and an appraisal phase that follows students' completion of their task (Panadero, 2017). The inclusion of these three different phases stresses that students' active engagement in an academic task begins with forethought processes, such as goal setting and planning. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of students' engagement in forethought processes is pivotal, as this engagement likely shapes their approach to completing academic tasks. For instance, the goals students set directly impact the strategies they employ. Therefore, our study seeks to delve deeply into students' forethought processes, aiming to enhance our understanding of their active involvement in SRL.

## Forethought processes

Although SRL frameworks share the assumption that students engage in processes prior to initiating work on academic tasks, there are inconsistencies between frameworks on which processes are deemed essential. Also, while some processes have been supported by empirical evidence, others have received less attention. In the following sections, we articulate the forethought processes described by SRL researchers along with empirical evidence for these processes.

### Activation of prior knowledge and beliefs

Frameworks of SRL include the activation of knowledge and beliefs as key forethought processes (Pintrich & Zusho, 2007; Zimmerman, 2000). Boekaerts (1997) described prior knowledge as "an essential and powerful ingredient in SRL" (p. 163). When starting work on an academic task, students may search their memory for task-related knowledge (Moos & Azevedo, 2008). Research indicates that prior knowledge impacts students' SRL strategies as they engage in an academic task (Taub et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2018). Whether or not a student activates prior knowledge can be influenced by the specific structure of the task and the support provided to students. In one study, researchers found that undergraduates who received conceptual scaffolds (i.e. guiding questions) activated their knowledge more frequently than students who did not (Moos & Azevedo, 2008). In addition to activating prior content knowledge, students might also activate their knowledge of metacognitive strategies (Pintrich, 2000).

## Self-Regulated Learning Forethought Processes in College Students

## Task Definition and Motivational Beliefs

During forethought, students may construct a task definition or identify their perceptions of a task and the task context (Efklides, 2011; Pintrich, 2004; Winne & Hadwin, 1998). Greene et al. (2012) found that students' task definitions improved over time and were negatively related to monitoring, suggesting better task definitions may reduce monitoring needs. This provides initial evidence of the importance of developing task definitions.

## Goal Setting

Goal setting emerges from developing task perceptions (Winne & Hadwin, 1998). Goals should include standards for judgment and may relate to different aspects of students' lives, potentially working together or against each other (Kim et al., 2023).

Researchers categorize goals based on complexity:
- Proximal goals: Less complex, quickly achievable
- Distal goals: More complex, requiring more time and effort (Latham & Locke, 2007)

These goals may be hierarchically organized, with process goals helping monitor progress toward distal goals (Zimmerman, 2000). Goal specificity varies, with some students setting vague goals lacking strategies or standards (McCardle & Hadwin, 2015).

Research supports links between goal setting and academic achievement:
- Experimental studies show goal setting interventions improve performance (Garavalia & Gredler, 2002; Ridley et al., 1992)
- Students setting both proximal and distal learning goals use more strategies (Seijts & Latham, 2001)
- Qualitative research shows students perceive goal setting as facilitating academic success (Cheung, 2004; Travers et al., 2015)

## Planning

Based on specific goals, students may develop plans - intended steps for execution (Winne & Hadwin, 1998). Plans identify methods for task completion and ways to control personal and environmental aspects. Strategy selection should consider task and context (Zimmerman, 2000).

Research indicates plans relate to strategies and academic outcomes:
- Planning habits support effective task completion (Eilam & Aharon, 2003)
- Higher-quality planning connects to strategy usage (Greene et al., 2012)
- Planning prompts increase strategy use and predict performance (Nückles et al., 2009)

## The Present Study

While forethought is considered essential for college students' self-regulated learning (SRL), empirical support varies across processes. Studies typically focus on individual processes rather than investigating forethought holistically. This study aims to identify and describe major self-regulatory processes college students implement before academic tasks.

### Research Questions
1. What are the major forethought processes college students engage in prior to initiating academic tasks?
2. What factors do students perceive as influencing their forethought?

### Research Design
- Grounded theory approach (Bryant & Charmaz, 2012; Corbin & Strauss, 2008)
- Participants: Undergraduates (N = 23) from two calculus courses
  - White (n = 13)
  - Asian (n = 8)
  - Black or African American (remaining participants)

## Data Collection and Analysis of Student Forethought Processes

### Participants

Students self-identified their race/ethnicity as White (n = 15), Asian (n = 6), Black or African American (n = 1), or Latinx or Hispanic (n = 1). Students self-identified their gender as female (n = 9), male (n = 13), transgender or transgressive (n = 0), and prefer not to disclose (n = 1). Students self-reported their academic rank as first-year (n = 7), second-year (n = 10), third-year (n = 2), or fourth-year (n = 4). All students were pursuing a STEM-related degree and were enrolled in Calculus 2 (n = 15) or Engineering Calculus (n = 8).

### Data Collection

Data were collected using a demographic survey and a semi-structured Zoom interview. On average, interviews lasted 51 min (SD = 8.58). Students received extra course credit for their participation. The interview included questions aimed at better understanding the specific processes students engaged in prior to starting academic assignments.

### Data Analytic Strategies

Data analysis included open coding, axial coding, and selective coding (Corbin & Strauss, 2008). First, the lead author reviewed and revised the Zoom-generated transcripts rectifying any inaccuracies. Second, this same researcher read through all interview transcripts to develop an initial list of codes. These codes were created through open coding by comparing descriptions of processes across interviews and looking for commonalities (Belgrave & Seide, 2019; Corbin & Strauss, 2008). While creating this initial list of codes, memos from each step of the interview process were compiled and reviewed for emerging themes. After developing an initial list of codes, the codes were applied to all interviews. Throughout the coding process, the lead author facilitated regular check-ins with the coauthors of this study to ensure trustworthiness.

Third, the lead author reviewed each code and the research memos. During this coding phase, she focused on understanding how the codes related to one another (i.e. axial coding; Belgrave & Seide, 2019; Corbin & Strauss, 2008). In situations where codes seemed to overlap, they were collapsed into one larger, more encompassing code. As a result of this phase, a second list of codes was developed.

As outlined by Schwandt (2014), a code test was conducted by employing a second coder. First, the second coder reviewed the developed list of codes and applied these codes to excerpts from seven random transcripts. The percentage of agreement between the first author and the second coder was 62%. Following this code test, the first author and second coder met to review the inconsistencies. The consensus was that students' descriptions of processes were interrelated and, thus, challenging to distinguish between. The codes were revised and a second reliability check was conducted (intercoder reliability = 74%). After this final reliability check, the coders met to strengthen the descriptions of the codes one final time.

As a final step, the lead author conducted selective coding (Belgrave & Seide, 2019; Corbin & Strauss, 2008). During selective coding, the relationships among individual codes were considered. Codes that emphasized the processes students engaged in prior to initiating academic tasks were grouped together and termed forethought.

### Findings

This analytic coding process revealed that students engaged in five forethought processes prior to beginning their academic tasks in calculus. In addition, students described the ways in which their beliefs about the subject domain, prior experiences, and subject domain and context influenced their forethought and other SRL processes.

#### Major Forethought Processes

The five forethought processes that emerged were:
- Identifying goals
- Ordering and prioritizing tasks
- Scheduling
- Storing goals and plans
- Regulating goals and plans

Analyses of students'

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

Students who were enrolled in multiple classes also ordered their academic tasks. As students described prioritizing their tasks, they referred to criteria upon which their ordering was based. Importance and task difficulty were two criteria students used to order their tasks. Gerry noted feeling "more relaxed" about her easier tasks, so she completed challenging tasks first. Jennifer described making decisions based on how long she expected a specific task to take, which indicated the difficulty of the task. Then, she completed all easy tasks first, "I'll write it like everything in red and then green. Then the green is like easy things that'll take five minutes and I'll put the time next to it– like how long I think it's going to take me." For Jennifer, the initial step of categorizing tasks into red (i.e. challenging/lengthy) and green (i.e. easy/short) helped her decide which tasks to complete first.

In addition to prioritizing separate academic tasks, students also prioritized the steps required to complete larger calculus tasks. These steps indicated a specific structure or system that students developed to approach their academic tasks. Sam illustrated his approach to structuring and dividing the course material when studying for exams:

> I took the number of lessons that we had and subtracted it from the exam date. It was around like 10 or 12 days so... I went back to like the very first lesson of that segment and...I worked my way through the homework.

As Sam notes, the number of days leading up to the exam informed the way that he divided course information. Then, he worked from the oldest information to the most recent information.

## Scheduling

Based on student descriptions, identifying days and/or times they would complete academic tasks appears to be a third important forethought process. Jack described adding his class and study times to his electronic calendar to create a schedule, "I have a calendar here where I have math, studying, which includes lectures...It blocks off from [12:30 to 4:30] pretty much every single day where I can just focus on math." Oftentimes, scheduling tasks connected to ordering and prioritizing, where students identified the order of their tasks and then identified when they would complete those tasks. These schedules created a routine where students developed days to consistently complete calculus.

As a part of the scheduling process, some students intentionally scheduled a buffer between deadlines and when they planned to work on their tasks. Students reported working ahead on assignments to allow additional time to complete an assignment. For Jennifer, this scheduling was based on giving herself a buffer between task completion and the task deadline, "I try to stick to getting everything done two days in advance so when I write it down... I'll write the assignment two days before it's due." For some students, this buffer allowed space for unexpected or anticipated events or challenges.

## Storing goals and plans

Although some students relied on their memory to keep track of their goals and plans, most students utilized external tools. Identifying goals, ordering and prioritizing, and scheduling informed the storage of these goals and plans. Many students used the calendar tools embedded in their university's learning management system. Other students used electronic tools external to their learning management system. Oftentimes, these tools provided a large list of the tasks students needed to complete (e.g. wall calendar). As an example, Max explained his storage system:

> I have the [learning management system] app...so I'm able to go on there really efficiently and effectively and look at things and make sure everything's due... I write down all the assignment due dates and try to look at that every once in a while.

Students also relied on tools to assist in their ordering, prioritizing, and scheduling. Sometimes, students specified a time in their week or time in their day when they updated these tools. For example, one student described spending time once a month writing a full schedule. Jon discussed his monthly calendar:

> My monthly calendar has really helped me... So I did the whole month and I'm like, okay...it looks like I'm gonna be really busy like the week of the 16th so... maybe the week before...I need to start working ahead to make sure that I'm not super, super swamped that

## Active Learning in Higher Education

## Prior Experiences and Student Beliefs

Students recollected that both their beliefs and strategies changed over time. Having completed at least two semesters of college coursework prior to enrolling in their summer classes, their reflections focused on prior college experience. This was particularly evident for students retaking calculus multiple times.

As one student, Tommy, reflected:

"In high school, I took some [math courses] and back at that time I didn't realize...how useful math is. But like after being in college and gradually taking all those like major courses... I gradually just realized that math is so important and useful."

Students noted their strategies changed as semesters progressed. For some, the beginning of semester prompted intentional strategy use that diminished over time. As Ben described:

"[My strategies] honestly probably have gotten worse because that's how all my classes tend to go...I feel like at the beginning I was doing my homework I would do the lesson the day before and then the homework the next day and it would still be like two days early. Now it's lesson and homework on the same day...it's due so I think my process is getting a lot more condensed, not necessarily better."

## Subject Domain and Context

Students described how domain and context influenced their motivation and forethought. They noted different goals for different classes, with greater focus on learning in courses they enjoyed or that connected to long-term goals.

Major-specific courses often received different treatment. Quinn, a computer science engineering major, explained:

"So for like for [general education courses], I'd say the goal there is to get like a super high grade because I feel like [general education courses] are like...low level...I don't care about much other than the grade, but like [computer science and engineering] courses that are like more specific to my major... I honestly should care about the grade more, I just really care about, like, understanding the information."

Course schedule and organization also influenced students' task management. Some students intentionally created their own context by choosing classes to establish effective learning structures. For example, Andrew selected 8:00 A.M. courses noting:

"When classes were in person at the university... I would make sure I had like an 8:00 A.M. class every morning... just so I... had something to get out of bed early in the morning for because I operate like a lot more efficiently early in the morning than I do later in the afternoon."

## Discussion

This study identified five major processes students engage in when initiating academic tasks:
- Identifying goals
- Ordering and prioritizing tasks
- Scheduling
- Storing goals and plans
- Regulating goals and plans

Additionally, three factors influenced students' forethought:
- Beliefs about the subject domain
- Prior experiences
- Subject domain and context

These findings substantiate the importance of forethought in student learning processes.

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

Students described goal setting as a central forethought process. The descriptions of performance and mastery goals align with research focused on the types of goals that students pursue in achievement contexts (Elliot et al., 2011). Achievement goal theory posits that students adopt specific purposes when working toward their academic tasks and connects the specific goals they adopt to strategy use, learning, and academic performance (Wolters, 2004). Including goal-setting as a major forethought process aligns with SRL frameworks (Pintrich, 2004; Zimmerman, 2000).

Interestingly, students described identifying different goals (i.e. performance and mastery) simultaneously. The idea that students might adopt multiple reasons for doing their academic work is not new (e.g. Barron & Harackiewicz, 2001). Researchers have argued that students work toward multiple goals simultaneously, both within and outside of the classroom (Kim et al., 2023; Valle et al., 2003). Boekaerts and Corno (2005) noted that classroom learning is not always linear. Thus, students may identify and work toward multiple goals related to one single task.

Planning is often considered a central SRL process (Pintrich & Zusho, 2007; Winne & Hadwin, 1998; Zimmerman, 2000). The undergraduates interviewed did not describe planning as a singular process. Instead, they described multiple processes that formed the basis of their plans: ordering and prioritizing tasks, scheduling, and storing goals and plans. Notably, all three processes have been included in students' time management (Wolters & Brady, 2021). Wolters and Brady (2021) suggested that, when considering time management within a framework of SRL, students consider deadlines and identify time management strategies during forethought. They also suggested that students develop plans by identifying when work will be completed. These time management subprocesses of forethought seem closely connected to our findings. Considering information about task deadlines seems to directly connect to ordering and prioritizing tasks, setting goals for when to work seems to connect to scheduling, and identifying strategies for time management seems to connect to storing goals and plans. This indicates that time management may be especially salient during the forethought phase of SRL.

Ordering and prioritizing tasks, scheduling, and storing goals and plans demonstrated the influence of both the external environment and internal beliefs on forethought. For example, when considering ordering and prioritizing tasks, students' decisions on the order of tasks were not based on a single criterion. Instead, the decisions were a more complex negotiation between internal and external factors influencing task completion. Similarly, students' scheduling was based on their responsibilities. Some students followed a consistent schedule, whereas other students did not. Finally, students' storage of goals and plans was based on preferences for specific types of tools. Thus, for each of these processes, identifying a set of specific strategies students tended to use was challenging. Each student chose specific strategies based on their external environment and internal beliefs.

Notably, although research has highlighted the importance of cognitive strategies for academic achievement (Dent & Koenka, 2016), as students described their planning, they did not describe selecting cognitive strategies. When students discussed their specific approach to calculus, they focused less on their learning approaches and more on the ordering of tasks. The lack of specific cognitive strategies could have been due to at least two reasons.

## Active Learning in Higher Education

conducted midway through the semester, students might have developed routine approaches to complete their calculus class. Compared to the beginning of the semester, the specific strategies used to approach their academic tasks might not have been as salient as logistical considerations about ordering tasks or the specific time they planned to complete an academic task. Two, compared to academic tasks in other classes, the assignments students completed in their calculus course might not have allowed for much variation in students' specific strategies.

Regulating goals and plans shares similarities and differences with prior perspectives on SRL. For instance, Winne and Hadwin's (1998) describe reframing goals as central to SRL. They suggested that students can identify initial goals during the task definition phase and then reframe these goals during the goal setting and planning phase. In addition, regulation has been considered an important aspect of SRL; however, regulation typically describes the ways students respond to feedback generated through self-monitoring while completing an academic task (Pintrich & Zusho, 2007). Thus, regulation is not typically considered an aspect of students' forethought. Students' inclusion of regulating goals and plans as an aspect of forethought points to the interdependence of SRL phases. The interdependent nature of SRL phases might mean that students are simultaneously engaged in processes connected to multiple phases. Although theoretical frameworks describe distinctions between phases, in practice phases might overlap with one another and occur less sequentially. To more accurately capture students' experiences engaging in SRL, researchers should account for the recursive nature of SRL.

It is important to note that students typically described regulating distal goals and plans, like pursuing specific degree programs. Students also described identifying alternative plans or revising their initial plans prior to implementing these plans. This may be due to the hierarchical nature of students' goals; students may be regulating multiple proximal and distal goals simultaneously. Because of the recursive nature of SRL, the regulation of one goal may prompt the regulation of another goal. Thus, because undergraduates are balancing multiple tasks simultaneously (Kim et al., 2021), they might regulate their plans and goals prior to beginning an academic task.

Taken together, it is clear that students' engagement in forethought is composed of a series of interrelated and somewhat overlapping processes. Findings from this study articulate processes that have not previously been considered. Because the choices students make during forethought likely inform other phases of SRL, a deeper understanding of these forethought processes provides researchers and practitioners with new avenues to support student learning. An important next step in future research is to investigate the influence of these processes on engagement and achievement.

## Critical factors that shape students' forethought

College students' engagement in SRL does not occur in a vacuum. Instead, there are many different influences on SRL. In the present study, students indicated that their beliefs, prior experiences, subject domain and context influenced the extent to which they engaged in forethought processes. To develop a thorough understanding of students' self-regulatory forethought processes, future research is essential to further understand these potential antecedents and influences on forethought.

### Beliefs about the subject domain

Consistent with frameworks of SRL (Pintrich & Zusho, 2007; Winne & Hadwin, 1998; Zimmerman, 2000) students' forethought processes and their engagement in calculus were related to their beliefs. Interestingly, the specificity of students' beliefs varied. Some students entered calculus with strong beliefs about their mathematics abilities, whereas others described beliefs about calculus. While causal conclusions cannot be made based on students'

Here's the cleaned and normalized Markdown:

descriptions, these findings highlight the need for future research exploring how students' more general beliefs about a particular subject area influence their class beliefs. As an example, do students' general beliefs about their science ability influence particular science courses (e.g. physics) and, in turn, do these beliefs influence forethought?

## Prior experiences

Students described changes in their beliefs and strategies as time progressed. Although it is not always explicitly included in frameworks of SRL, there is a general assumption that cycles of SRL influence one another, where an earlier cycle influences successive cycles. Both Pintrich (2000) and Zimmerman (2000) especially note that information gained during the reflection phase of one SRL cycle might influence future SRL cycles. This indicates that students' engagement in SRL can vary over time. It is important to note that changes across time do not always reflect more effective SRL. At least one study has demonstrated an increase in more passive regulation across a postgraduate education program (Endedijk et al., 2014). In the present study, some students seemed to develop more effective strategies, while others noted declines in their motivation and strategies.

## Subject domain and context

An underlying assumption of theories of SRL is that context plays a role in how students engage in SRL (Panadero, 2017). Our findings highlight the ways college students can strategically design their own learning contexts. Compared to younger students, undergraduates have the autonomy to make decisions about their class schedule. They are able to choose the focus, format, and timing of their courses, which influences their learning experiences. Thus, in addition to professors shaping students' learning contexts, students also shape their own learning contexts.

In a sense, researchers have explored the ways that students shape their own context using environmental management strategies (Brady et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2020). Students might implement specific strategies to control aspects of their environment (e.g. Studying in the library). Researchers have paid less attention to larger decisions students make to control their context, such as strategically choosing college courses.

## Limitations

The context of this study should be considered when interpreting findings. Because this study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, students were exclusively enrolled in online courses. Additionally, because students self-selected to participate in the study, there might have been idiosyncrasies related to the specific students who chose to participate compared to other students enrolled in calculus class. In the future, researchers should investigate students' forethought processes using data collection methods that can capture a larger number of students' experiences.

## Conclusion

Our findings expand and update understandings of SRL and suggest that undergraduates engage in five processes as they begin their active engagement in academics: identifying goals; ordering and prioritizing tasks; scheduling; storing goals and plans; and regulating goals and plans. We also highlight that students perceive beliefs about the subject domain, prior experiences, and context and domain as connected to forethought. These findings provide support for frameworks of SRL while uncovering processes that have received less empirical attention. They point to the importance of investigating forethought as an important aspect of students' active engagement in SRL.
