## Abstract

Advising systems automate aspects of academic advising. Traditionally, advising systems focused on specialized tasks such as course selection. Recently, chatbot-based advising systems have emerged as they emulate scenario-based advising. Nevertheless, the design of most chatbot-based advising systems is not user-centric, potentially causing a lack of adoption. Further, there is a lack of studies reporting findings of usability evaluation of chatbot-based advising systems. In response, we contribute a chatbot-based academic advising system, MyAdvisor, that helps students with prescriptive academic inquiries. The system is based on real advising scenarios and designed with usability principles. The results show that students learn the system fast and find it helpful. This work contributes (1) scenario-based functional requirements and usability requirements of the chatbot-based advising system, (2) the application of usability heuristics in the design of the system, and (3) findings of empirically evaluating the system usability.

## 1. Introduction

Higher education institutions assign academic advisors to assist students with inquiries such as course selection, scheduling, academic issues, and access to resources (Pizzolato, 2006). In practice, however, advisors are often tasked with a high number of students and insufficient time, causing dissatisfaction with the quality of advice that some students receive (Unelsr√∏d, 2011). Inadequate advising may hurt students' academic progress (Daramola et al., 2014).

Due to its complex and time-consuming nature, recommender and expert systems have been proposed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of academic advising (Iatrellis et al., 2017). Examples of expert and recommender advising systems can be found in (Al Ahmar, 2011; Daramola et al., 2014; Engin et al., 2014; Ragab et al., 2012). Such systems typically assist students with specialized tasks such as course and major selection. As such, the designers of the systems placed considerable emphasis on the accuracy of the functionality, e.g., course recommendations. However, the interaction between students and such systems is limited, and thus, little attention has been given to the usability of the systems.

With the advent of artificial intelligence, including natural language processing (NLP), conversational agents, also called chatbots, have recently been utilized in academic advising due to their ability to emulate conversations between advisors and students. Examples of chatbot-based advising systems can be found in (Mekni et al., 2020; Patel et al., 2019; Ranoliya et al., 2017; Zahour et al., 2020). These systems assist students with frequently asked questions, course information, and scheduling. Nevertheless, works on chatbot-based advising systems lack: (1) a user-centric approach to capturing and expressing the advising requirements to be implemented in the systems, (2) a systematic methodology to ensure the usability of the systems, and (3) findings from usability evaluations with users. Consequently, we argue that it is crucial to bridge the gaps in existing chatbot-based advising systems by introducing a chatbot-based advising system developed with usability in mind. It is also essential to report findings of usability evaluations of chatbot-based advising systems as it is helpful for practitioners and researchers desiring to design and implement similar systems.

To fill the gap in the literature, we contribute MyAdvisor, a chatbot-based advising system designed to emulate real advising scenarios between advisors and students. Students converse with the system, inquire about academic rules and planning, and seek help with coursework or other issues. The system design was guided by

## Academic Advising System Development and Evaluation

## Research Questions and Contributions

The first research question investigates the elements and stages needed for a highly usable chatbot-based advising system. This article presents several phases of MyAdvisor development to answer the question, including requirements gathering and design. Further, the involvement of stakeholders (advisors and stakeholders) in the design and evaluation process is presented. MyAdvisor's requirements are derived from actual advising sessions between students and advisors, while its design is grounded in usability heuristics.

The second research question aims to elicit findings from empirical usability evaluations of MyAdvisor. Such findings could point to improvements and usability issues with MyAdvisor that may need to be addressed by similar future systems. To answer the second research question, we conducted an empirical evaluation. The results are largely promising, but a discussion of improvement points is presented in the article.

The contributions of this work can be summarized as:
1. A presentation of the scenario-based functional and usability requirements of a chatbot-based advising system. The scenarios were captured with semi-structured interviews and field observations.
2. The reliance on heuristics for further enhancing the scenarios implemented in the chatbot
3. Reporting the findings of empirically evaluating the usability and usefulness of the chatbot-based advising system.

## Literature Review

### Academic Advising

Academic advising includes developmental, prescriptive, and intrusive advising, each of which involves advisor-student interaction (Noaman & Ahmed, 2015).

Developmental advising helps students define and explore academic and career objectives through a process (White, 2006). Many articles indicate that students prefer this approach (Broadbridge, 1996; Crookston, 2009), albeit this approach requires a significant number of resources (Mottarella et al., 2004).

Prescriptive Advising provides students with information about their academic programs, such as policies, rules, major requirements, and course selection (Mottarella et al., 2004). Students initiate the conversation to address questions or issues related to their academic progress.

Intrusive Advising usually targets at-risk or high-achieving students and is characterized by advisors initiating the conversation with students at critical periods of their academic journey, such as first-year or as they are approaching graduation (Mottarella et al., 2004). Although some students may find it invasive (Mottarella et al., 2004), this form of advising impacts student retention positively (Schwebel et al., 2008).

MyAdvisor is a chatbot-based advising system that answers students' inquiries related to academic rules, course selection, help with coursework, and other issues. The conversations are short-term, goal-oriented, and initiated by students. As such, MyAdvisor fits into the category of prescriptive advising systems. In fact, most of the existing chatbots used in academia handle pull requests where students initiate the communication (Dibitonto et al., 2018).

### Types of Advising Systems

Advising systems belong to these types:
1. Rule-based expert systems
2. Fuzzy logic-based expert systems
3. Recommender system-based expert systems
4. Chatbot-based systems

An expert system emulates the decision of a human expert (Jackson, 1998). Rule-based expert systems usually employ if-else rules as well as predicates. Engin et al. (2014) discussed implementing a rule-based expert system that assists students with limited advising use cases such as course selection and scholarship eligibility. Similar examples can be found in (Al-Ghamdi et al., 2012; Nambiar & Dutta, 2019). Some expert systems incorporate a dialog-based user interface to obtain initial user data, for instance, build a student profile before giving advice (Bouaiachi et al., 2014).

A fuzzy expert system utilizes fuzzy logic to express rules.

## Literature Review (continued)

2019). Generally, the design of such systems includes the planning of intents (the goal the student has in mind), the common questions from students, and the appropriate responses by the system. The flow of the conversation changes depending on rules and contextual information. In some instances, an ontology aligns the academic inquiries with the correct entities (Santoso et al., 2018).

Chatbots that help students with general questions are usually connected to a dataset containing frequently asked questions, such as the ones discussed in (Daswani et al., 2020; Ranoliya et al., 2017), where the authors designed the chatbot using Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) to accept several types of inquiries about general university rules, activities, availability of services, and university rankings. The chatbots were not systematically evaluated for usability with users, although one study presented in (Page & Gehlbach, 2017) was assessed in a field experiment with only 13.5% of the queries not answered by the system.

Some chatbot-based systems, such as (Lim et al., 2021), focused on implementing machine-learning prediction algorithms using attendance and performance data points to identify students who need early intervention. Much of the article focuses on the prediction algorithm, and the chatbot is planned to be implemented in the future, and thus no usability evaluation was reported. Other chatbot-based systems such as (Ho et al., 2018) discussed the interaction with the system to help students with course selection. Nevertheless, the article only presents a brief example and does not present the design of the scenarios between students and the system. Further, no systematic usability evaluation was conducted.

Two notable examples of chatbots intended to be designed with usability in mind are LiSA (Dibitonto et al., 2018) and UniBud (Alkhoori et al., 2020). The authors of LiSA report that the design must be based on understanding students' needs. Consequently, the authors conducted a questionnaire in which they identified that most students need a chatbot service for inquiring about course information, studying abroad, events, and more. The authors also stress that the chatbot must be designed with empathy in mind. Likewise, the authors of UniBud emphasize that usability requirements such as task efficiency and ease of learning must be considered in designing a chatbot. Nevertheless, since they have not been implemented, neither LiSA nor UniBud has been evaluated with real students. As such, they remain theoretical contributions.

To sum up, the use of chatbots in academic advising is on the rise. However, the design of most of the existing concrete chatbot-based advising systems focused on functionality (i.e., assisting students with inquiries) based on pre-defined datasets and largely overlooked the usability of such systems. Since a chatbot is a conversational user interface (CUI) and borrows elements from a graphical user interface (GUI) (Klopfenstein et al., 2017), it is crucial to provide a compelling user interface as most users quickly abandon chatbots if not satisfied (Brandtzaeg & F√∏lstad, 2018). Only a few systems, such as (Latorre-Navarro & Harris, 2015), evaluated the system's usability, but the system's initial design did not consider usability.

Contrary to the chatbot-based advising systems in the literature, the design of MyAdvisor is characterized by being:

1. User-centric: The requirements of MyAdvisor are elicited from real stakeholders, including advisors and students. Further, the functional requirements are scenario-based, correspond to actual advising sessions, and usability heuristics guided the design of MyAdvisor.
2. Rigorously evaluated: MyAdvisor is evaluated with a usability test and the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire.

## Literature Review Findings

That advising systems are needed to solve a commonly known problem, automating some aspects of advising such as course selection, understanding university rules, and other issues. Chatbot-based systems are the latest generation of advising systems, and they combine NLP and rule-based algorithms to emulate advising sessions between advisors and students. However, the implemented chatbot-based systems largely overlooked usability principles and were not evaluated for usability. Only two to-be-implemented chatbots discussed the importance of usability (empathy with users, task efficiency, and ease of learning). Some chatbots relied on existing Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) datasets for requirement elicitation, whereas others conducted questionnaires, but none of the current systems presented a detailed process for collecting the requirements. Table 1 summarizes the findings from the literature.

In the design cycle, we first conducted semi-structured interviews with expert advisors. The purpose was to identify main functional requirements and common advising scenarios. Further, we observed several advising sessions between advisors and students, which captured several advising scenarios of the interviews. The scenarios were validated with expert advisors. Thereafter, we consolidated the scenarios in a use case diagram. Finally, we applied usability heuristics to the design of the scenarios (Section 4).

In the rigor cycle (Section 5), we conducted empirical usability tests and questionnaires with 17 students and 4 expert advisors. The results were promising in terms of ease of learning and task efficiency, but improvement points were identified.

## Methodology

In this section, we briefly present the design process of MyAdvisor. After that, we discuss designing MyAdvisor, including the functional and usability requirements, the scenario elicitation details, the capturing and modeling of the scenarios, the architecture, and the incorporation of usability heuristics in the design of the scenarios.

### Design Process

In designing MyAdvisor, we mainly elicited the requirements from two stakeholders (students and expert advisors) and consulted the university guide. Table 2 shows the stakeholder profiles and the requirement elicitation techniques we used to elicit the data from stakeholders. The profiles of the stakeholders and students were elicited through informal conversations with them. While they may not accurately describe every advisor and student, they cater to the average population.

Figure 2 shows the process of designing MyAdvisor. First, we interviewed expert advisors using semi-structured interviews, which began with open-ended questions about

## Functional Requirements

To derive the functional requirements of MyAdvisor, we consulted with the academic guide at the university and conducted four semi-structured interviews with expert advisors to understand the needs and issues of an academic advising system. Each interview lasted approximately 40 minutes. We followed the methodology presented in (Lauesen, 2002; Lauesen & Kuhail, 2011). The interview began with open-ended questions asking expert advisors about common advising inquiries from the students. As the conversation developed, we asked closed-ended questions about the details of advising scenarios. Figure 3 shows a part of the conversation with an expert advisor.

Further, to elicit more data, we observed real advising situations where students were engaged with advisors in conversations. As a result, we elicited five main functional requirements of the system (Table 3) as well as 15 advising scenarios that are covered in Section 4.3. Other system requirements include integration, transaction, and administration requirements, but we only focus on the system's main features from the user's perspective.

## Usability Requirements

ISO (2018) defines usability as "the extent to which a product can be used to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction in a specified context of use." Usability requirements deal with how easy it is for an operator to use the system, including ease of learning and efficiency (Zelkowitz, 2012). Usability requirements are only a subset of quality requirements. Other quality requirements, including security, performance, and maintainability (Lauesen, 2002), are outside the scope of this work.

Usability includes these essential factors: learnability, task efficiency, memorability, and subjective satisfaction (Nielsen, 1993). To define the usability requirements of MyAdvisor, we followed the recommendations in (Lauesen & Younessi, 1998) in which we first prioritized the usability factors as follows:

1. Learnability (Important). An easy-to-learn system must be easy to grasp for first-time users. For most students, interacting with a chatbot-based academic advisor will be their first time. Even when the system matures, the university admits new students every year. As such, MyAdvisor must be easy to learn. Consequently, we consider learnability important.

2. Task Efficiency (Important). An efficient system supports fast usage for frequent users. An advising system is expected to be used regularly. Thus, we consider task efficiency important.

3. Memorability (Slightly important). This factor indicates that the system must be easy to remember for users who use it casually, which is not the case for MyAdvisor as most students will be regular users. Accordingly, this factor is considered slightly important compared to factors 1 and 2.

4. Subjective satisfaction (Moderately important). This usability factor is concerned with how satisfied users are with the system. This factor is hard to measure and can be influenced by aspects other than the system, such as the general motivation, stress level, culture, and organizational factors (Lauesen & Younessi, 1998). Accordingly, we consider this factor moderately important.

To conclude, learnability and task efficiency are the most critical factors for MyAdvisor. Time on task is a vital metric for learnability and task efficiency (Joyce, 2019). Other metrics such as the number of errors can measure learnability. However, they are not used to measure task efficiency. Accordingly, we specified the usability requirements to be performance-based, i.e., measurable with time. The requirements accommodate first-time and experienced users (users who have repeatedly performed the task more than nine times). The time a frequent student needs is half the time a first-time student needs for the same task. This period was determined in discussion with expert advisors at the university.

Here's the cleaned and normalized Markdown:

The interviews with advisors and observation fields resulted in 15 scenarios that captured several advising scenarios. Figure 5 shows a use case diagram of the 15 major advising scenarios of MyAdvisor. Some scenarios may invoke others. For instance, scenario 1 may invoke scenarios 2, 3, or 4 depending on the interaction flow. Scenarios can be personalized as the conversation depends on students' data (Scenarios 1, 14, and 15). Further, they can incorporate university rules (Scenarios 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, and 15). Some scenarios include advice to students on the course of actions to be done (Scenarios 2, 3, 14, and 15), while other scenarios simply inform students about existing resources and activities in the university (Scenarios 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, and 15).

### Writing advising scenarios

We wrote the advising scenarios using a template inspired by the use case (Jacobson et al., 1992) and task description (Lauesen, 2003) techniques. Since our advising scenarios are a series of interactions between students and the chatbot-based advising system, we used use cases to describe a sequence of actions, including variants, that a system performs to yield an observable result to an actor (Booch et al., 1999). However, the scenarios in use cases may enforce a particular flow, which is not the case for advising sessions where a scenario may not always start with the same step. The flow of actions may change depending on the interaction. Accordingly, we made the steps in our scenarios optional and separated the technical details from the user actions as prescribed in task descriptions.

For space reasons, we only present one advising scenario in this article (Table 3). The remaining 14 scenarios can be found in the supplementary appendix.

Table 5 shows the "Low Performance" advising scenario. In this scenario, the student is inquiring about improving their academic performance. The "Requirements" field in the table shows the related functional and usability requirements. The "Start" field describes how the scenario starts, while the "End" field describes how it ends. The "Steps" field describes the logical sequence of the scenario. However, the sequence need not be strictly followed. For instance, the student may start the scenario directly with any of the steps 2.1‚Äì2.5. 

The "Actor" field explains who is communicating in that step. "Advisor" refers to the system (MyAdvisor), while "Student" refers to a human student who is using MyAdvisor. The table includes the "Technical Details" column to keep the scenario easy to read, which explains rules and implementation details. Such details can be helpful for developers to implement the scenarios. Generally, the "Step" column is relatively stable, while the "Technical Details" may change depending on the academic rules and policies.

The expressions mentioned in the steps are only examples. For instance, "How can I improve my GPA?" is only one way the student asks for ways to improve their GPA. However, MyAdvisor will be trained for several expressions similar in meaning when the scenario is implemented.

For the advisor, only one of the optional substeps labeled alphabetically (e.g., substeps 2a and 2b) will be used in a scenario depending on the technical details on the right-hand side. Likewise, for the student, only one of the substeps labeled numerically (e.g., 2.1, 2.2) will be used in a scenario.

The advisor may help the student with the conversation by suggesting expressions (such as the expressions 2.1‚Äì2.5), and the student may choose one of them or mention an expression similar in meaning to them.

Depending on the flow, the subsequent steps in the scenario correspond to their predecessor steps. For instance, substep 3.1 is the response to substep 2.1, and 3.

The number of levels in a scenario is kept to three levels to ensure readability and reproducibility. If more levels are needed, a new scenario is invoked.

The scenarios have been validated with expert advisors to ensure completeness and correctness of details. For instance, when discussing a previous version of the scenario in Table 5 with an expert advisor, she mentioned additional ways to improve a GPA and corrected a few technical details on the right-hand side column.

## Usability Heuristics

10. Help and documentation: It is ideal if the system does not need additional documentation. However, it may be needed to help users understand the system's functionality.

The strengths of the usability heuristics and principles are timelessness and applicability to several types of user interfaces, including conversational (chatbot-based) ones. Nevertheless, being generic makes them also open to interpretation by several designers (Sugisaki & Bleiker, 2020), especially for conversational interfaces, which have unique characteristics such as sequential communication and freedom of interaction and initiative (Shneiderman et al., 2016).

Based on the general usability heuristics and principles, several researchers developed a set of usability heuristics for designing and evaluating conversational user interfaces (Bos et al., 1999; Murad et al., 2019; Sugisaki & Bleiker, 2020). The heuristics are based on the aforementioned usability heuristics in conjunction with specificities related to conversation and language studies.

In designing the scenarios of MyAdvisor, we used the heuristics relevant to conversational interfaces discussed in (Murad et al., 2019; Sugisaki & Bleiker, 2020). The heuristics can be found in Tables 6‚Äì8. The following subsections show how we tailored our design to meet the usability heuristics.

## Visibility/feedback of the system

MyAdvisor communicates its limits (Heuristic 1.1). For instance, if the student asks for something that MyAdvisor cannot do, the student is told that MyAdvisor cannot help with that request (Figure 8). Further, to help the student, they are given options for what services the advisor can offer.

We relied on the Google Dialogflow chatbot interface to distinguish between the messages of the human user and the conversational agent. The interface looks like interfaces of popular messaging applications, making it clear whose turn in the conversation it is (Heuristic 1.2).

## Mapping between the system and the real world

MyAdvisor pulls data from a realistic database, where responses are based on facts stored in the database. Figure 9 shows answers from MyAdvisor that reflect the correct status of the courses. For instance, the course SWE245 is offered as multiple sections, while SWE346 is not offered according to the system's database (Heuristic 2.1). As another example, when a student wants to change their major, the system tells them they cannot due to a rule imposed by the university (Heuristic 2.1).

MyAdvisor attempts to collaborate with students to help them accomplish their goals (Heuristic 2.2). In scenarios where it is anticipated that students need additional information, MyAdvisor offers it. As an example, Figure 10 (left) shows that when students ask who teaches a course, MyAdvisor mentions the instructors teaching the courses and offers to provide timings of the sections as it is commonly asked. As another example, Figure 10 (right) shows that when the student asks a rather vague question such as "How can I change my field?", MyAdvisor clarifies the question and gives several suggestions.

MyAdvisor only uses terminology that is familiar to students (Heuristic 2.3). We validated the interactions with expert advisors who pointed out terms or phrases that may be ambiguous or confusing to students. Accordingly, we removed all such phrases and replaced them with terms that the expert advisors believe are familiar to students.

## User control and freedom

Initially, MyAdvisor welcomes students, but students can always initiate the conversation by asking questions or requiring advice (Heuristic 3.1). Similarly, the student can end the conversation at any point, for instance, by saying, "I have to go now. See you!", and MyAdvisor will interpret this as the end of the conversation (Heuristic 3.2).

## Consistency

All the terms MyAdvisor uses, such as "semester," "course," "section," "schedule," and "enrollment," have been used consistently in several interactions (Heuristic 4.1).

## Recognition rather than recall

When interacting with MyAdvisor, students are not expected to know all its capabilities and functions, especially for the first time. Figure 11 (left) shows how MyAdvisor presents the most common functionalities (Heuristic 5.1). Further, we do not expect students to know the possible values of a list. As such, we provide the possible list options from which students can choose. For instance, Figure 11 (middle) shows that MyAdvisor asks the student to provide the topic of discussion with the human advisor and provide a list to choose from (Heuristic 5.2).

Students are not expected to know the format of data MyAdvisor expects. Figure 11 (right) shows an example of MyAdvisor giving the students examples of date formats it expects (heuristic 5.3).

## Flexibility and efficiency of use

We used fuzzy matching of Google Dialogflow to match the instructor's names and course titles based on approximate matching as students are not expected to know the exact spelling of course titles or teacher's names. If there is only one match in the database that is very close (80% similar or above), it will be automatically corrected (H

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

### 4.7.7. Aesthetics and minimalism in design and dialogue

MyAdvisor gives responses to students that are as short as possible, mentioning only applicable information (Heuristic 7.1). For instance, Figure 15 shows different responses to the same request made by two different students. In Figure 15 (left), the student has taken more than 75 credit hours, which disqualifies them from changing their major, while the student in Figure 15 (right) has taken less than 75 credit hours, and thus MyAdvisor advises them on how to request a major change.

MyAdvisor is designed to respond empathetically, especially if the student reports an adverse event or provides incorrect data (Heuristic 7.2). For instance, Figure 16 (left) shows an example of a student reporting issues with their instructor. As a result, MyAdvisor empathetically responds, "Sorry to hear that," and proceeds with the conversation. Figure 16 (right) shows an example of the student entering the wrong data. MyAdvisor responds that it could not find a course with the ID rather than a direct message such as "No course with this ID exists."

### 4.7.8. Error prevention

The phrases used to train were mostly suggested by undergraduate students and expert advisors at the university. Some phrases are sometimes intentionally incorrect in grammar, punctuation, word order, etc. (Heuristic 8.1). Nevertheless, even though we cannot anticipate all expressions that students in real life may say, MyAdvisor uses the NLP algorithms incorporated in Dialogflow, which will still allow expressions other than the training phrases (but similar to them) to trigger the intent. Figure 17 shows several examples of phrases that can trigger the 'Help with Low Performance' intent.

### 4.7.9. Allowing users to recognize and recover from errors

There are instances when the human user means something but does not express it correctly. In general, MyAdvisor allows users to correct the misunderstandings of the conversational agent (Heuristic 9.1). Figure 18 shows two examples of the human user correcting the apparent misunderstandings of MyAdvisor.

### 4.7.10. Help and documentation

To ensure that the conversation stays on topic, MyAdvisor helps students with suggestions (Heuristic 10.1). To help students explore the options that MyAdvisor can help with, MyAdvisor gives relevant hints whenever possible (Heuristic 10.2). For instance, Figure 19 shows an example of MyAdvisor giving hints on other related expressions the students can use.

### 5. Evaluation

We conducted evaluation studies with 17 students and 4 expert advisors. Our main objective was to evaluate the learnability and perceived usefulness of MyAdvisor and identify the usability problems. We judged that the number of participants we tested with was sufficient for identifying whether MyAdvisor was easy to learn. Nielsen and Landauer (1993) empirically found that most usability problems are found by testing with five participants.

We have received the ethical clearance to conduct our evaluation on 20th Feb 2021 from the Research Ethics Committee at Zayed University (Ethics Application Number: ZU21_004_F). Further, the participants (students and advisors) were consented before participating in the evaluation. The purpose of the evaluation was explained to them, and they could opt out at any point of the study, as explained in the consent document.

### 5.1. Participant information

All student participants were undergraduate students who had no prior experience with MyAdvisor. We announced our need for participants in the evaluation study in classes and asked our colleagues and expert advisors to spread the message to their students to recruit student participants.

Here's the cleaned and normalized Markdown:

## Student and Expert Advisor Evaluation

Table 9 shows the student participant information. Most of the participants were undergraduate students in their 3rd year of study, and a few were in their 4th year of study with ages ranging between 21 and 22 years of age. The participants majored in Information Technology, Finance, Marketing, and Multimedia. All the students were savvy IT users with knowledge of using basic software applications such as MS Word, MS Excel, and MS PowerPoint. The IT students have basic programming skills (e.g., variables, loops, basic data structures, etc.).

We also recruited expert advisors to evaluate the usability of MyAdvisor by simply reaching out to them by e-mail. The advisors who participated in the evaluation differed from those who participated in the design process. Table 10 shows the information of expert advisors. The four advisors were female, with an average age of 33. They are average IT users who know how to use basic software applications such as MS PowerPoint, MS Word, and MS Excel.

### Evaluation Study Settings and Measurements

We conducted evaluation sessions with 17 students and 4 expert advisors. Each evaluation session lasted 40 min on average and was carried out online via Zoom (2021). We introduced the purpose of the evaluation and the main objective of MyAdvisor. Participants were given 13 tasks to work on, and they were able to read the tasks and ask for clarifications if they did not understand the tasks. We asked the participants to use their wording and think aloud as they carried out the tasks, mainly when something was ambiguous. Once participants were done with tasks, they were asked to fill out a post-study questionnaire. During the evaluation session, the participants were asked to share their screens. The sessions were recorded to refer to them and assess them in detail, apart from the post-study questionnaire, where the participants were asked to stop sharing their screens.

The study's objective was to assess the usability and usefulness of MyAdvisor, which are mainly measured with two metrics:
1. Task completion time to evaluate the ease of learning and task efficiency
2. Number of successful/failed attempts, which gives a strong indication of ease of learning

The task completion was measured by calculating the time difference (in minutes) between the time the participant started and ended working on the task. A task attempt was only considered successful when the participant successfully received the expected response from MyAdvisor and correctly interpreted it and is considered a failed attempt when the participant did not receive the expected response from MyAdvisor or incorrectly interpreted an expected response.

### Test Tasks

We wrote 13 tasks that the participants worked on. In writing the tasks, we ensured that the text contained no hidden help, which would bias the results. Further, we designed the tasks to cover several dimensions of prescriptive advising. For instance, Tasks 1‚Äì3 assess academic resource accessibility, while Tasks 4 and 5 cover information seeking. Further, Tasks 6‚Äì9 inquire about academic rules, while tasks 10‚Äì12 are exploration and future planning tasks. Finally, Task 13 allows us to gain insight into things students would like to accomplish with MyAdvisor that we have not envisioned.

The test tasks were as follows:

- Task 1: Assuming you have a low GPA, you are looking for help to improve it. Ask MyAdvisor to help you.
- Task 2: You are having difficulty understanding an instructor, and you would like to get help with how to cope with that. Ask MyAdvisor to help you.
- Task 3: You are struggling with understanding the materials of a certain course (e.g., SWE225), and you would help with that.
- Task 4: You would like to know the timings of a certain course (SWE225).
- Task 5: You would like to know who teaches a certain course (SWE225).
- Task 6: You are not sure if you can change your field or not.
- Task 7:

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

### 5.4. Questionnaire

After completing the tasks, the participants were asked to fill out a standard System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire, a reliable and versatile usability ten-question questionnaire used by researchers and industry experts (Hassenzahl & Tractinsky, 2006). The participants were asked to fill out all the ten questions of SUS. Further, we asked participants about what they liked and disliked about MyAdvisor in general, whether they would use such a system in real life, whether they would name the system a human name, and the type of communication style they prefer with the system. Finally, they were asked to suggest features they would like to see in the system.

### 5.5. Results of evaluating MyAdvisor

Overall, the evaluation results were very encouraging in terms of the percentage of task success, the average time that was spent on tasks, as well as the quantitative and qualitative feedback we received from the student participants. In general, the participants used a variety of expressions to accomplish the tasks, many of which MyAdvisor was not explicitly trained to handle, yet the expressions triggered the correct intents. Further, MyAdvisor tolerated expressions with grammatical and punctuation mistakes. Also, some participants utilized the suggestions made by MyAdvisor, which resulted in the success of tasks.

In general, the participants appreciated the ease of use, speed, accuracy, and convenience provided by MyAdvisor. However, some participants sometimes felt that MyAdvisor did not understand them as a human advisor would or that its advice was too general.

In the following subsections, we provide the details of our evaluation.

#### 5.5.1. Percentage of success and failure

On average, the students succeeded in 92% of the attempts they made on tasks with a success rate of 100% in Tasks 1, 7, 8, and 9, a rate of nearly 94% in Tasks 3, 4, 5, 10, and 12, a rate of 82% in Tasks 2 and 11, and a rate of 75% in Task 6. Concerning advisors, the evaluation results were slightly less successful but still encouraging (85% success rate on average). The advisors had the same success rate as students (100%) in Tasks 7 and 9 and similar results in Tasks 2, 4, 5, 10, and 12 with only a 5% difference. The main difference can be observed in Task 3 (advisors: 50%, students: 95%).

#### 5.5.2. Reasons for task failure

We analyzed the failed tasks and identified several reasons for failure. The most common reason for failure was a lack of training (8 cases with students, 1 case with an advisor). Another common reason is that the expressions used by the participants were too general (4 cases with students, 2 cases with advisors). On the other hand, there were two cases of the students using too specific expressions. In the first case, a student attempting Task 3 referred to "PALS," a student study club that the system couldn't identify. In the second case, a student attempting Task 6 referred to specific colleges in the expression.

Another notable reason for failure was that participants did not find some MyAdvisor's responses satisfactory even though we thought it was appropriate (1 case with a student, 1 case with an advisor).

Interestingly, there was a case of a student wanting to navigate back to a previous intent, a feature not available in MyAdvisor now. Further, in two instances, the advisors were not satisfied with the responses given by the system. For instance, an advisor mentioned that the resource suggested for helping with a course is inadequate.

### 5.5.7. Quantitative questionnaire results

The quantitative portion of the questionnaire was the SUS questions. The participants filled out the ten SUS questions found in (Usability.gov, 2022). However, for clarity of reporting, we divided the survey into two parts: (A) a strong agreement indicates high usability, and (B) a strong disagreement indicates high usability. In general, the results were largely in favor of MyAdvisor.

In part A of the SUS questions, most participants strongly agreed or agreed with several statements (Figure 22). For example, on the statement, "I felt very confident using MyAdvisor," 15 (88.2%) students strongly agreed, one (5.8%) agreed, and one (5.8%) was neutral compared to 2 (50%) advisors who strongly agreed, one (25%) agreed, and one (25%) was neutral. Further, on the statements, "I would imagine that most people would learn to use MyAdvisor very quickly" and "I thought MyAdvisor was easy to use," 12 (70.5%) students strongly agreed, 4 (23.5%) agreed, and one (5.8%) strongly disagreed. In comparison, 3 (75%) advisors strongly agreed, and one (25%) agreed on the same statements.

Similar levels of agreement for students and advisors can be found concerning the other statements.

In part B of the SUS questions, most participants strongly disagreed or disagreed with several statements, with one advisor agreeing with some statements (Figure 23). For instance, on the statement, "I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with MyAdvisor," 11 (64.7%) students strongly disagreed, 3 (17.6%) disagreed, and one (5.8%) was neutral compared to 3 (75%) advisors who strongly disagreed, and one (25%) agreed.

Similar levels of disagreement can be found in the other questions for advisors and students.

We calculated the overall SUS score for the participants based on the methodology described in (Usability.gov, 2022). The average overall SUS scores were highly encouraging for both students and advisors (86.47 for students and 80.62 for advisors). Both results are considered excellent or above excellent (Sauro, 2018). However, with the number of participants being relatively small, such results cannot be conclusive. Figure 24 shows a box plot of the SUS scores. In general, the scores for students ranged between 72 and 92, with one outlier with a score of 22.5. The standard deviation is 16.8, and the median is 16.8. In comparison, the SUS scores for advisors ranged between 65 and 100. The median is 78.75, and the standard deviation is 13.72.

### 5.5.8. Qualitative questionnaire results

We asked the students several open-ended questions on several issues and applied thematic analysis to obtain insights about their answers.

On the question, "would you use such a system? why?", 16 (94.1%) students said "yes," and only one (5.8%) said "no." In comparison, 3 (75%) advisors said "yes," and only one (25%) said, "maybe." The participants with a positive answer mentioned several reasons for using it, most of which are related to usability factors such as speed, simplicity, and ease of use (Figure 25). The participants also mentioned other reasons for using MyAdvisor, including convenience, not wanting to wait for a human advisor, and being shy to talk to a human advisor.

On the questions, "would you give MyAdvisor a human name? Would you like it visualized (embodied)?," many

Here's the cleaned and normalized Markdown:

## Results of User Preferences and System Evaluation

Many participants (10 students, 2 advisors) wanted to give MyAdvisor a human name but did not want it visualized (embodied). In comparison, fewer participants wanted MyAdvisor to be visualized (7 students, 2 advisors) and to keep the current name "MyAdvisor" (7 students, 1 advisor).

Regarding what they liked about MyAdvisor, participants gave answers similar to why they would use MyAdvisor. The participants liked:
- Speed of answer (6 students, 3 advisors)
- Ease of use (8 students, 1 advisor)
- Not having to wait for a human advisor (4 students)
- Accuracy of answers (2 advisors)

For dislikes, participants cited:
- System limitations in handling questions (6 students)
- System's inability to understand them as a human would (3 students, 2 advisors)
- Having to insert specific keywords to receive correct responses (4 students)
- Advice being imperfect (1 student)
- Inability to go back to previous interactions (1 student)

Regarding MyAdvisor's communication style, participants preferred:
- Excited tone (8 students, 2 advisors)
- Formal communication style (5 students, 2 advisors)
- Informal style (5 students)
- Use of emojis (5 students, 2 advisors)
- Small talk capability (4 students, 1 advisor)

For new features, some participants (3 students, 1 advisor) suggested allowing appointment booking with human advisors when unsatisfied with responses. Students also suggested features like showing schedules, course enrollment, and study tips.

## Study Limitations

The study had several limitations:
- Small, female-dominant sample from only four programs in a single institution
- Cultural context affecting trust towards automation and academic support variations
- Artificial testing environment under researcher observation
- Time effect on SUS scores for some participants (Group A vs Group B)

## Discussion and Conclusion

Academic advising is crucial to students' success. This work demonstrated the possibility of emulating conversational advising sessions with a chatbot-based system. The research addressed two main questions:

### RQ1: Designing a User-centric Chatbot-based Advising System

The study showed that successful design requires:
- Stakeholder involvement throughout development
- Iterative scenario capture through field observations and interviews
- Non-sequential, readable scenario documentation
- Separate business rules documentation
- Specialized conversational system usability heuristics

### RQ2: Usability Evaluation Findings

The system (MyAdvisor) proved:
- Easy to learn
- Fast to use
- Achieved encouraging SUS results (Student average: 86.47, Advisor average: 80.6)

## Results and Discussion

Our result is relatively similar to that reported in a recent study (Vukovac et al., 2021). The authors used SUS to evaluate the usability of an educational chatbot (SUS average score: 72.4). Another study presenting an educational chatbot reports the results of the average SUS score as 75 (Schreuders et al., 2018). However, the numbers of participants in both studies were 76 (Vukovac et al., 2021) and 32 (Schreuders et al., 2018), which are higher than our study (17 students, 4 advisors). While SUS is a potentially helpful metric, some researchers argue that SUS was not designed with chatbots in mind. The global SUS average score (68) was calculated for conventional systems instead of chatbots (Holmes et al., 2019).

Another notable usability finding is that students used fewer words than advisors to interact with MyAdvisor. Further, most students do not give up when the chatbot-based advising system misunderstands them, and when they attempt a task a second time, they often succeed. The reason might be that MyAdvisor was communicating to the students that it did not understand them, which promoted them to try again. A study agrees with this finding that chatbots must manage failed situations by admitting failure as a possible solution (Jain et al., 2018).

On the positive side, MyAdvisor's design tolerated grammatical and punctuation mistakes. However, this study identified reasons for task failure, including a lack of training, too general, or specific expressions used by students. Students communicate their needs differently with a chatbot-based advising system. Some of them use formal language, whereas others use informal language. Some use long sentences, while others prefer short ones. Our results agree with a recent study (Janssen et al., 2021). According to the study, it is hard to predict how users will interact with chatbots, and thus, iterative testing is needed to identify gaps.

In terms of participants' opinion on the communication style of MyAdvisor, most participants seem to prefer MyAdvisor to be warm and excited, more than half of them prefer an informal communication style, and the others prefer a formal one. In general, the area of chatbot communication style overlaps with chatbot personality. For instance, a warm and excited communication style can be associated with an extrovert personality (McCrae & Costa, 1987). The personality of chatbots is a topic that researchers are increasingly investigating. For instance, a recent study suggests that finding ways for chatbots to interact with users based on personality traits may provide them with a more personalized experienced and allows organizations to create value from human-machine interfaces (Shumanov & Johnson, 2021).

Another noteworthy finding of our study is that chatbot suggestions seem to help students accomplish tasks. This finding agrees with a recent study that conducted a large-scale user study and found that chatbot suggestions have consistently improved response efficiency (Gao & Jiang, 2021).

On the negative side, students still feel that such a system is limited in comprehending and handling several questions. Interestingly, a few students mentioned they would use the system as they would be shy to ask human advisors' advice. Similar findings were found in (Pesonen, 2021), as students find it safe to talk to chatbots about their issues.

## Conclusion

This work introduced a chatbot-based prescriptive advising system, MyAdvisor. The system is based on real advising scenarios. Thus, it engages the students in a conversation to advise them on various issues, including informative, rule-based, and resource-related questions. The answers often rely on data from the university database and are even personalized to the student.

The contribution of this work can be summarized as:
1. A presentation of the scenario-based requirements of a chatbot-based system, which were captured with semi-structured interviews and field observations
2. Tailoring the design of the chat
