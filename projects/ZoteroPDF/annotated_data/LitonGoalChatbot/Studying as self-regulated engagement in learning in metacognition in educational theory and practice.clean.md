# Studying as Self-Regulated Learning

Asked what they are doing as they engage in school- or university-related activities, students might say, "I'm working on my project," "I'm doing homework," or, commonly, "I'm studying." Charting the boundaries of studying is a fuzzy task. Colloquially, the range of activities it encompasses is nearly synonymous with all the activities that probabilistically lead to "a relatively permanent change in cognitive structure."* However, several features may distinguish studying from the subsuming category of learning activities. In particular, studying:

1. Rarely includes direct or frequent intervention by a teacher.
2. Is often a solo activity, although peer mediation is also common.
3. Often originates with a general goal set by a teacher that the student subsequently interprets at the studying session's outset and refines in a recursive way as studying unfolds.
4. Quite often involves searching in and synthesizing information from multiple sources, for example; a text book, notes taken in a class or borrowed from a friend, a volume of an encyclopedia, a video or TV show, or online databases (e.

## The COPES Model of Study Tasks

Studying tasks vary enormously. We use a 5-facet typology as a schema to characterize instances of studying in terms of common dimensions: conditions, operations, products, evaluations (of products), and standards (for products). The typology, presented in Table 12.1, is referred to by the first-letter acronym COPES because it identifies facets of tasks that a student copes with in studying and learning (see Winne, 1997; Winne & Marx, 1989). In Table 12.1, we offer four instances of COPES facets that correspond to each of four stages of studying described next.

## Four Stages of Studying

We theorize that a complete model of studying has four basic stages: task definition, goal setting and planning, enactment, and adaptation (see also Simpson & Nist, 1984). In the task definition stage, the student generates a perception about what the studying task is, and what constraints and resources are in place. Based on this perception or definition of the task, at Stage 2, the student selects or generates idiosyncratic goal(s) and constructs a plan for addressing that study task. In the enactment stage, the plan of study tactics that was created in Stage 2 is carried out. In Stage 4, based on the overall experience of this studying event at the first three stages, the student makes changes to cognitive structure that will affect future studying tasks. This forward planning changes knowledge, skills, beliefs, dispositions, and motivational factors that the student predicts will play important roles in future studying tasks.

All four stages of studying have the same general cognitive architecture (see Fig. 12.1). A collage of environmental factors and cognitive information constitutes the conditions within which cognitive activities occur. Single cognitive operations and coordinated sets of them (tactics, strategies) create internal products by transforming conditions (Winne, 1989). For example, previously inert information in long-term memory may be stimulated and made available to working memory, information that is not organized may be assembled into a structured form, information represented in one medium (e.g., words) may be translated into another medium (e.g., algebraic symbols, an image), an inference or an attribution may be generated, and so forth. Operations also can create external performance behaviors the student enacts that others can observe. Our four stages of studying are distinguished by the product created at each stage.

## Studying as Self-Regulated Learning

We adopt the common assumption that studying, like other forms of behavior, is a goal directed activity (Winne, 1995a). In our model of studying, goals are represented as a multivariate profile of standards. Standards characterize ideal, optimal, or satisficing states. For example, a student may hold standards to study a chapter (a) in 30 minutes, (b) so that a judgment of comprehension about the whole chapter is high, while (c) allowing that judgments of learning for specific bits of information are low (e.g., see Schraw, 1994).

We theorize that products take two forms. Cognitively, products are represented as a multivariate profile of attributes. For example, at the stage of defining the studying task, a student with a performance motivational orientation might perceive an assignment to study a chapter as a task that involves reading (a) without deep processing while (b) marking (highlighting) definitions and principles for future review. We hypothesize that, if students were asked to describe what they perceived or understood about informational products they create within a stage of studying, they would name such attributes and report levels for them. Externally, products can be manifested as behavior or performance.

When students monitor a product's profile of attributes against the profile of standards, cognitive evaluations are generated that mark whether an attribute is on target, how much off target an attribute is, and whether there is a discrepancy between items listed as standards and attributes of a product. External evaluations also can be created by performance when, for instance, a statistics package for the social sciences (SPSS) program has an error or a friend complains that a summary is off target. If the student acts on evaluations, this is control by which elements in the collage of cognitive conditions may be altered; standards may be adjusted, added, or abandoned; and, operations of new kinds may be carried out.

Our 4-stage model, like models of self-regulated learning (Butler & Winne, 1995; Nelson & Narens, 1994; Winne, 1995a, 1995b, 1996), is a recursive, weakly sequenced system. In recursive systems, products of earlier stages (or steps within a stage) update conditions on which operations work during the next cycle of activity. For example, the product of Stage 1, a definition of the studying task, updates cognitive conditions that establish the information and resources used in Stage 2, generating goals and plans. Although studying generally proceeds from Stage 1 to 2 to 3 to 4, stages are weakly sequenced and do not necessarily unfold in order. Some studying tasks may be so familiar that defining the task (Stage 1) is virtually skipped. Students who practice means-ends analysis will oscillate frequently between generating goals and plans (Stage 2) and enacting study tactics (Stage 3). Making adaptations can occur at practically any point.

## Stage 1: Task Definition

In this stage, the student develops a perception about features of the task, charting the task as a "study space." As we noted earlier, most study tasks are indeterminate with respect to one or several COPES facets. Thus, the student must make inferences about the nature of these facets. An important element in the product of this stage is the student's perception of a goal for the task. A goal is a set of standards by which the task can be judged. The student's perceived goal may be the same goal that the teacher or the text set. Or, it may be a goal that the student frames. Grade school students' questions about whether the assignment will be graded exemplify this stage of studying.

[Figure 12.1: The COPES model of metacognitive monitoring and control in four stages of studying.]

## Studying as Self-Regulated Learning

## Task Definition and Perception
Students develop perceptions about study tasks through both academic and experimental contexts. For example, students make inferences about standards when determining if assignments must be completed individually or can be collaborative. These perceptions can influence goal-setting and planning in subsequent stages.

In experimental research settings, even with explicit instructions like "Read the material and review if time permits," students must make various interpretations about:
- Whether texts will be available during recall
- If annotation is permitted
- What type of test to expect

Individual differences ensure variance in how students perceive seemingly identical study tasks.

## Goal Setting and Planning
Students may adjust initial goals based on personal standards. For example:
- Performance-oriented students might lower standards to "just getting by"
- Plans may be developed for simplistic tactics like paraphrasing headings
- Students might plan to allocate time for deep processing of novel or complex sections

## Enacting Study Tactics and Strategies
In this stage, students implement their planned tactics and strategies:
- Study tactics include summarizing, mnemonics, underlining, and reviewing
- Internal feedback is generated during implementation
- Students may adapt plans based on monitoring progress
- New tactics may be activated to address gaps or errors
- Students may quit if they judge no available tactics will achieve their goals

## Metacognitively Adapting Studying
In the final stage, students inspect the products of previous stages, monitoring them against standards.

The model recognizes that studying involves dynamic adaptation as students:
- Monitor their progress
- Generate internal feedback
- Adjust tactics based on changing conditions
- Make attributions about their performance
- Modify plans based on available time and resources

## Studying as Self-Regulated Learning

## Metacognition in Studying

We propose that each stage of studying should be considered in terms of two main factors. The first factor is the student's expertise in the subject matter domain. Students' subject matter expertise reduces the need to allocate substantial cognitive resources to studying because domain knowledge itself is sufficient to make progress or achieve success (Schneider, 1993). For example, Korkel (1987; cited in Schneider, 1993) found that students' metacognitive knowledge about generic cognitive tactics for studying text combined linearly with the extent of domain knowledge in accounting for amount recalled. Domain novices (in soccer) with more metacognitive knowledge about generic studying tactics recalled more than novices with less metacognitive knowledge. The same benefit of metacognitive knowledge was observed among domain experts. Experts with less knowledge about cognitive tactics recalled less about what they had studied than experts with more knowledge of study tactics. Thus, when experts study material in their domain, although metacognition may be less frequent because it is less necessary (McKoon & Ratcliff, 1992; see also Wyatt, Pressley, El-Dinary, Stein, Evans, & Brown, 1993), metacognition can still benefit experts' studying.

The second factor to be considered in modeling studying is the degree to which the student is metacognitively active. Models of metacognition (Nelson & Narens, 1990, 1994) distinguish two "levels" of information—the object-level and the meta-level—and two operations—monitoring and control. In our 4-stage model of studying, object-level information corresponds to the products of cognitive operations that are created in each stage of studying: a definition of the task, goals and plans, tactics and strategies, and adaptations. Meta-level information in our model has two elements. Metastandards describe object-level conditions, operations, products, and standards. They constitute the student's model of studying and provide the basis for metacognitively monitoring studying. The second element of meta-level information consists of cognitive operations that change object-level elements. This is metacognitive control.

### Metacognitive Monitoring

Metacognitive monitoring is a cognitive operation that has two inputs and creates one product. One input is an object-level multivariate profile of attributes for a product of studying. The second input is a meta-level multivariate profile of attributes that constitutes a standard for that product. The product that metacognitive monitoring creates is a third multivariate profile of attributes, one that records discrepancies between the object-level information and the meta-level information. In our COPES typology, this cognitively generated product is an evaluation that serves as feedback.

For example, suppose a student is in Stage 3 of studying, enacting a study tactic. The tactic is mapping the correspondence between features of a principle that has been presented in a text and an example that the student is now studying (e.g., Walczyk & Hall, 1989). This is a monitoring tactic. It compares attributes that describe two forms of domain information, the principle and the example. The product this monitoring generates is a list of matches and non-matches. This is non-metacognitive monitoring. The standards that monitoring uses are neither a meta-level model of a principle nor a description of how to apply the study tactic.

However, suppose the student has a meta-level model that describes general standards for using study tactics. For a student who holds the epistemological view (cognitive condition) that learning should be quick and effortless (Schommer, 1994), three meta-level standards for studying would be:
- time spent should be minimal
- effort (ease of learning judgments, Nelson & Narens, 1990; depth of search; see Winne, 1997) required to apply a study tactic should be minimal
- the judgment of learning (Nelson & Narens, 1990) that follows using a study tactic should

## Studying as Self-Regulated Learning

## Metacognitive Control and Self-Regulated Studying

Metacognitive control changes the task space at the object-level. The discrepancies created by metacognitive monitoring can be modeled as IFs in an IF-THEN (condition-action) rule. The THEN component of these rules is a cognitive operation (or a set of operations, a production system), such as a study tactic, that changes object-level information in the task space.

Suppose the student with the epistemological stance that learning should be quick and effortless monitors that, although time and effort are within tolerance of the meta-level standards, the judgment of learning is weak relative to the meta-level standard. This profile of attributes may trigger a 2-step production system:

1. IF time and effort spent are on target and 
   IF judgment of learning is below standard,
   THEN attribute the negative difference to high task difficulty.

2. IF task difficulty is high,
   THEN quit the task.

This is self-regulated studying, task engagement in which students adapt their approach to studying to reduce discrepancies revealed by metacognitive monitoring. Our example illustrates a form of self-regulation that is almost surely academically counterproductive (Winne, 1995a) because, based on idiosyncratically rational criteria (Anderson, 1991), it leads the student to quit the task for the "wrong" reasons. In parallel to negative effects of subject matter misconceptions (Pintrich, Marx, & Boyle, 1993) on learning in general, meta-level misconceptions (e.g., the double-edged sword; see Covington, 1992) can also interfere with studying.

## Forms of Metacognitive Control 

We suggest a distinction between two forms of metacognitive control that exercises self-regulation, toggling and editing. With toggling, the student turns studying tactics or other cognitive operations on and off. Toggling immediately changes the task space by shaping the mix of operations carried out in a stage of studying.

With the second form of metacognitive control, editing, the student does more than just toggle operations on and off. In editing, changes are made to object-level cognitive conditions and study tactics. If changes are extended to meta-level standards for metacognitive monitoring, the student engages in mindful abstraction (Salomon & Perkins, 1989). Following Rumelhart and Norman (1978), we suggest that three kinds of changes can be made by editing:

1. Accreting: adding or subtracting (specializing or generalizing) (a) propositions in conditional knowledge that trigger study tactics, (b) component operations that enact study tactics, and (c) propositions that constitute standards for metacognitive monitoring.

2. Tuning: adjusting weights and thresholds that govern how propositions in conditional knowledge articulate in metacognitive monitoring; or, changing the sequence for performing operations in a study tactic.

3. Restructuring: substantially reconstituting conditional knowledge and significantly changing the mix of operations that make up studying tactics, including inventing new components.

Although toggling and all three kinds of editing can be topics of explicit deliberation, very extended practice plus evaluations can make them automatic, pushing features of their use beneath reportable levels of attention (McKoon & Ratcliff, 1992). When this state is achieved, previously separate metacognitive activities have become composed as one smoothly running unit, and the student studies on self-regulated "auto-pilot." We note explicitly that the student's self-regulation may be judged by others' standards as deficient. Like other cognition, metacognitive aspects of studying are rationally adaptive (Anderson, 1991) in relation to criteria the individual adopts rather than criteria that others may hold "for" a student.

## Summary

We model studying as an activity that generally follows a 4-stage sequence. First, the student forms a perception of what the task is. Goals and plans are then created, followed by enacting study tactics that the student predicts can achieve

## STUDYING AS SELF-REGULATED LEARNING

When a student metacognitively examines studying, metacognitive control can be exercised to toggle study tactics on and off, or editing may be done to adapt the conditions, operations, or standards in cognitive structure that describe studying. Toggling and editing are forms of self-regulated studying, but not all forms of self-regulation are productive (Winne, 1995a, 1997).

## METACOGNITION IN STUDYING

A complete view of metacognitive engagement in studying at all four stages of studying encompasses several large classes of variables, as identified in Fig. 12.1. If the number and scope of these variables were not enough to make models of studying inherently complicated, our modeling of studying as a recursive event will. Although such models need not be chaotic, they can quickly explode in complexity.

Conditions in the external environment, including opportunities to receive external evaluations (Kluger & DeNisi, 1996), have been widely investigated in descriptive studies (e.g., questionnaire studies) and experiments. Conditions in the cognitive system, including feedback generated internally (see Butler & Winne, 1995) and variables that we loosely categorized as capacity or capability, are individual differences in cognitive structure. These also shape or, in the case of study tactics, are engines of studying and metacognition during studying.

## Students' Definitions of Studying Tasks

A few studies investigate what students perceive about studying tasks. That researchers and students can differ in their respective perceptions is illustrated in a study by Cordon and Day (1996). They observed that students do use reading comprehension tactics while taking standardized readings tests, a possibility that some researchers had ruled out. Little research documents correspondences between how students study at home, in study halls, or in their dorms versus how they report or have been observed to study in research settings. Because conditions within each stage of studying can vary widely as a function of differences in studying environments, it would be prudent to generalize cautiously from the research we report.

Some individual differences that color perceptions of studying tasks may be global and quite unresponsive to task conditions. Schommer (1994) reviewed research on learner's systems of epistemological "beliefs about the nature of knowledge and learning ... [that] are likely to affect reasoning, learning, and decision making" (p. 293). Her model describes five basic dimensions of such systems: source (handed down from authority vs. personally reasoned out), certainty (fixed vs. subject to revision), organization of knowledge (simple and compartmentalized vs. interwoven), control (predetermined vs. self-guided), and speed of learning (p. 301). These beliefs establish cognitive conditions that may lead students to adopt perceptions of tasks that pervade studying.

In one study (Schommer, 1990), undergraduates studied controversial texts that were missing a concluding paragraph on the resolution of the controversy, and then wrote a concluding paragraph. Qualities of their conclusions were predicted by epistemological beliefs. Undergraduates with stronger beliefs in quick learning tended to oversimplify the controversy. Those holding stronger beliefs in the certainty of knowledge were less likely to acknowledge that issues they had studied were indeterminate.

In another study (Schommer, Crouse, & Rhodes, 1992), undergraduates studied a text about statistics and were told to prepare for a multiple-choice test that contained items requiring both recognition and reasoning. After reading, but before the test, students estimated confidence in their understanding. Students' belief in simple-compartmentalized knowledge correlated negatively with learning but positively with overconfidence (relative to actual levels of performance). Students who held stronger beliefs in quick learning were more likely to report using shallow cognitive tactics for studying. A path analysis showed both direct and indirect effects on learning of the epistemological belief in simple knowledge.

Other studies suggest that not all perceptions of studying are inflexible. For example, Van Meter, Yokio, and Pressley (1994) interviewed college students about taking notes in lectures and how the students used notes to study subsequently. We report only a few illust

## Metacognitive Monitoring in Ambiguous Tasks

It seems a logical necessity that metacognitive monitoring is engaged when a task is ambiguous. Because domain knowledge cannot be relied on to guide a definition of the task in this case, the student must infer features of the task before engaging with it. Making such inferences involves a meta-level model (standard). A study by Wong, Wong, and LeMare (1982) illustrates this hypothesis in the context of a reading comprehension task. Some students were given paragraphs to read and "think about what the story is about." Other students received a text including pre-paragraph questions and were told those questions illustrated kinds of questions they would be asked after the study period. Pre-paragraph questions provide standards for monitoring two products: comprehension of each paragraph and perceptions about the reading comprehension task, namely, that comprehension meant learning only a subset of the information rather than all of it. Not surprisingly, students who received this explicit guidance performed better on comprehension and recall tests than students who did not receive pre-questions. Students who studied texts without pre-questions expressed frustration. They complained that there "was too much too learn." Their meta-level model of reading led them to infer they should learn everything. That standard did not align with the task. Not only did they perform less well, they also experienced emotional distress.

Study tasks may be ambiguous because they are not familiar to students. We know of no research that explicitly links familiarity to metacognition in studying. There is indirect evidence, however, that students do engage metacognitively in forming perceptions about learning tasks. For example, Winne and Marx (1982) interviewed elementary school students about what they perceived their teacher wanted them to do after the teacher had issued an instructional cue in a lesson. Their descriptions indicated that students do judge the familiarity of brief instructional episodes and, on that basis, the students exercised metacognitive control over how they engaged in classroom activities. Another illustration is provided by Briggs' (1990) investigation of the questions students asked when assigned a simple letter-copying task using an unfamiliar word processing system. Only students with considerable experience in word processing asked questions, presumably products of metacognitive monitoring, that were relevant to the task. Briggs concluded that many students lacked appropriate standards against which to metacognitively monitor what the task was and, thus, were unable to frame useful questions about the task.

In instances where tasks are ambiguous, it seems safe to hypothesize students will set their own goals and build plans on that basis. As our example of the grade school student suggested, students also may reframe goals that are explicit and clear before generating a plan for studying.

## Setting Goals and Devising Plans

Most models of learning in the contemporary literature characterize learning as goal directed. This is logically necessary when studying is metacognitively directed because metacognitive monitoring entails using meta-level models as standards (Paris & Byrnes, 1989). A spate of correlational studies link students' motivational orientations and self-reports of how they set goals and plans for studying. For example, Ainley (1993) classified high-school students' in terms of three motivational orientations: striving for mastery and understanding, enhancing ego by demonstrating ability, or just meeting task demands. Motivational orientation predicted students' reports of using deep approaches to studying in which they strove to select cognitive operations that linked new information to prior knowledge versus using surface approaches that committed to memory surface features of information as relatively discrete items (e.g., Biggs, 1991). Woulters, Yu, and Pintrich (1996) report stronger findings. Motivational orientation accounted for approximately 22% to 29% of the variance in 7th and 8th grade students' reports about studying tactics they used in English, mathematics, and social studies, and 18% to 20% of the variance in students' reports about metacognitively monitoring and controlling their studying tactics in these subjects.

Several lines of work suggest that having specific goals can

Here's the cleaned and normalized Markdown:

## Studying as Self-Regulated Learning

## Goal Setting and Planning

Students who set specific subgoals for each session and monitored their achievement scored higher on a final examination and reported more intrinsic interest for the subject than did students in the other three groups, who did not differ from one another. Students who set goals to study for set times studied longer than other students. On marks in other courses where, presumably, all the students studied "normally," there were no differences in achievement. In other words, students who profited by setting proximal subgoals for each study session in one course did not transfer the effect (and, presumably, the goal setting procedure) to those courses.

Not all goals are devised by students. Nolen and Haladyna (1990) distinguished between teacher goals and student goals. They suggested that, since teachers have the final say in student grades, students need to "figure out what the teacher wants" and study accordingly. Other research shows that when goals are set by others (teachers) and students adopt those goals, studying and resulting achievement improve if the goals target the process of learning rather than just producing acceptable outcomes (e.g., Schunk, 1996).

A study by Elbaum, Berg, and Dodd (1993) shows that the plans students build for studying are influenced by beliefs. They asked undergraduate students to allocate hours of instruction to either formal studying tasks that focus on the language per se (listening to and repeating sentences from an audiotape, and memorizing vocabulary and idioms, and having a native speaker correct errors in conversation) versus functional tasks that emphasize using the foreign language for communicative purposes (reading foreign language newspapers, keeping a diary written in the foreign language, and having conversations with native speakers who do not correct errors but encourage expression). The more students favored functional tasks, the less they perceived that knowledge of vocabulary and grammar were important goals, and the more they emphasized knowledge of sociolinguistic factors that shape language use and communication strategies that help new speakers compensate for linguistic limitations.

## Gaps in the Literature

Two notable gaps exist in the literature:

1. We know little about how students form goals (Winne, 1997). Carver and Scheier's (1990) model of self-regulated behavior provides a general answer, postulating a 3-tier hierarchy of feedback loops: idealized concept of self, general principles governing behavior, and behavior programs.

2. Research on when and how students engage in metacognition during task perception and goal-setting stages is scant. Metacognitive activity in these stages likely relates to:
   - The degree to which COPES facets are unspecified
   - The student's familiarity with the task

## Enacting Study Tactics and Strategies

Students must know about and have minimal skill in enacting study tactics and strategies for metacognitive control to enhance studying. The literature demonstrates gains when students are trained in study tactics compared to peers who study "normally." The consistency of findings suggests students may be undereducated about study tactics and strategies.

Some knowledge about tactics is subtle and might require direct instruction or supportive scaffolding (Winne, 1995a, 1995b, 1997). For example, Dempster (1988) argues that even educators are undereducated about the robust spacing effect - that learning can be improved by distributing study sessions. Students who do not metacognitively monitor against a standard that describes spacing of study sessions may learn less.

## Studying as Self-Regulated Learning

Students need both proper study tactics and understanding of how these tactics affect learning. Research shows that summarizing is an effective study tactic (Foos, 1995) because it involves deeper processing of information. When summarizing, students must:

- Judge which ideas are central versus peripheral
- Identify and repair comprehension gaps
- Retrieve, select, and organize information to build retrieval paths

Spurlin, Dansereau, O'Donnell, and Brooks (1988) compared students generating different numbers of summaries for a 2,500-word text:
- Four summaries (one per quarter)
- Two summaries (one per half)
- No summaries

Results showed students who made two summaries recalled more than both other groups. Foos (1995) replicated this pattern with a 2,800-word text, comparing groups making two summaries, one summary, or no summary. The interpretation is that integrating information into fewer summaries involves deeper processing and builds more useful retrieval cues than multiple independent summaries.

Research on experts suggests that conditional knowledge about tactics is typically embedded within domain expertise rather than stored separately (McKoon & Ratcliff, 1992). However, when domain expertise is challenged, experts deliberately monitor and control study tactics (Wyatt et al., 1993; Voss, Blais, Means, Greene, & Ahwesh, 1989).

Students' metacognitive monitoring can focus on either:
- Learning orientation (monitoring understanding and knowledge growth)
- Performance orientation (counting completed tasks) (Dweck & Leggett, 1988)

Tuckman (1996) found that students trained to use proven study tactics (identifying/defining key terms and elaborating with examples) spent more time studying but performed worse on final exams compared to students studying for frequent quizzes. This occurred because they adopted a performance goal of adding glossary entries rather than a learning goal of enhancing knowledge.

Research also indicates that personality dispositions like "need for cognition" influence metacognitive monitoring. Cacioppo, Petty, Feinstein, and Jarvis (1996) found that "cognizers" (high need for cognition) compared to "cognitive misers":
- Had better recall of studied information (d = 3.55, p < .001)
- Were more likely to assess arguments on merit (d = .312, p < .010)
- Showed greater metacognitive awareness of cognitive effort (d = .272, p < .001)
- Were more likely to engage in metacognitive control to correct biases

## Studying as Self-Regulated Learning

## Need for Cognition and Metacognition
Need for cognition has not yet been examined in terms of traces obtained during studying, but it seems a good candidate for inclusion as a pervasive yet probably tacit dispositional IF that affects metacognitively guided studying.

## Adapting Studying
As a result of metacognitive monitoring in Stage 3, students make changes to domain knowledge by adapting studying. Self-regulated learning, or metacognitive control of study tactics and strategies, is commonly viewed as occurring within the temporal boundaries of a study session. The methodological requirements for observing online, within-session self-regulation, however, are just now being conquered by advances in using computer technologies to trace how students study (Winne, Gupta, & Nesbit, 1994; Winne & Nesbit, 1995). Studies that use multiple-session designs, however, also demonstrate that students make forward reaching adaptations to studying tactics across study sessions as a result of metacognition about just-experienced (or prior) studying.

In one study, Rabinowitz, Freeman, and Cohen (1993) demonstrated an interaction between domain knowledge, first attempts to use studying tactics, and adapting approaches to study in a following study period. Students studied lists of randomly ordered words drawn from common categories (e.g., fruits, musical instruments). In a first session, students were told to use categorizing as a study tactic. One group studied items that were highly typical of the categories—domain knowledge was relevant here—whereas another group studied words low in typicality, making domain knowledge less useful. In a second study session, all students studied the same new list of medium typicality words using whatever study tactic(s) they preferred; no instructions were given to use categorizing as a study tactic. After recall of the new list, students were asked to describe study tactics they had used to study. And, after each of the two sessions, all students had rated how difficult, effortful, and useful it was to categorize words while studying.

The interesting finding concerns how students studied the second list. Recall of moderately typical words on the second list was the same for both groups, and it didn't differ from recall of the first list. Whatever study tactics students used in the second session were as effective as the categorizing tactic they were instructed to use studying the first list. Among students who studied highly typical items in the first session, 96% reported they used categorizing only or categorizing plus another tactic on the second list. Only one student abandoned categorizing outright. Among students who had studied less typical words in the first session, only 53% reused categorizing alone or supplemented it with another study tactic; the rest abandoned categorizing. Students' perceptions of whether they used categorizing as a study tactic were verified by clustering scores. Thus, students who first tried a study tactic that was ill-matched to the task, because domain knowledge of categories was not well-matched to categorizing the atypical words they were studying, were not likely to use that same tactic in a second task where it was more likely to be helpful because medium typicality words are more readily categorized.

In Rabinowitz et al.'s (1993) study, learners did not differ in the effort they said they applied to studying. Other research, however, suggests that effort is a condition that students metacognitively monitor and use in exercising metacognitive control. Eisenberger (1992) has reviewed research on the transfer of effort, characterizing such transfer as learned industriousness. In a typical study (Eisenberger, Masterson, & McDermitt, 1982), undergraduate women tackled problems involving addition, anagrams, and differences between pairs of cartoon pictures. One group of women experienced all three types of problems. Three other groups were asked only one kind of problem each. Within each of these four groups, half the students were given easy problems that required little effort (e.g., adding 2-digit numbers) and half were given difficult problems that required high effort (e.g., adding 7-digit numbers). In a

## STUDYING AS SELF-REGULATED LEARNING

These studies indicate that, across study sessions and across tasks, students exercise metacognitive control that changes conditions in Stage 1 of subsequent studying cycles or sessions. Given our hypothesis about the recursive properties of studying, these changes will percolate throughout that subsequent cycle or session.

## SUMMARY

Our model depicts studying as metacognitively powered self-regulated learning that spans four recursively linked and weakly sequenced stages: defining the task, goal setting and planning, enacting study tactics and strategies, and metacognitively adapting studying for the future (see Table 12.1). Each stage of studying is modeled by a single cognitive architecture in which environmental factors and individual differences (conditions) constitute a temporary state of a task space. Students engage in activities (operations) that create information (products) that can be monitored in relation to standards (see Fig. 12.1). 

At each stage, students generate internal feedback and may be provided with external feedback (evaluations). This updates their understanding of a task, goals and plans they create, the study tactics they enact, and produces relatively permanent adaptations to cognitive structures that describe tasks and studying. When models of tasks and studying are used as the basis for examining information at each stage, students engage in metacognitive monitoring. When students toggle tactics on and off or when they edit tactics, this metacognitive control effects self-regulating learning. We examined research that illustrates metacognition in each stage.

## FUTURE RESEARCH ON STUDYING AS SELF-REGULATED LEARNING

Research demonstrates individual differences in students' perceptions of a task, and we noted that a teacher's (or researcher's) perception of an assigned task may not align with students' understandings of "the" task. These differences originate with variance in students' beliefs, motivation, and prior knowledge, all of which, according to our model, are products of prior engagement with previous study tasks. Though we speculated about metacognition in Stage 1 of studying, we do not find that research has directly investigated how students exercise metacognitive monitoring and control when they generate an understanding about a study task.

It is frequently assumed that students' perceptions of goals (standards) for a study task match assigned goals. At least, when there is no check on this correspondence, it seems this assumption is made. There may be adequate equivalence between goals assigned and students' perceptions; however, our model allows that, at Stage 2, students can add to or modify goals that they may accurately acknowledge as having been set for them. Although there are studies that document disparities between assigned goals and adopted goals, we know of none that explicitly investigates roles played by metacognitive monitoring and control in goal setting and subsequent planning.

Metacognition is a driver for online changes that students make to tactics they use to study. This stage of studying has more frequently been a focus for research, and there is considerable evidence that metacognition is a powerful influence here. However, the field needs to know more about kinds of meta-level knowledge that students use in metacognitive monitoring and about students' editing study tactics.

Finally, the field is struggling with issues of how students maintain, transfer, and adapt their approaches to studying. These are questions about Stage 4 of our model. The backward- and forward-reaching nature of metacognitive monitoring and control in this larger scale adaptive work is clearly more complicated than the local adaptations addressed in Stage 3, where students enact and control tactics. Perhaps progress in understanding these larger scale adaptations requires developing more adequate views about metaknowledge per se. As clarified by Alexander, Schallert, and Hare (1991) in their review of terms researchers use to describe knowledge, this is a formidable task.

We have three major recommendations for future research about any stage or stages of studying:

1. Traces (Winne, 1982) of metacognitive monitoring and control should be a standard feature. Without such data, we have only indirect evidence about metacognitive events and their recursive and forward reaching features. Trace data can chart how students metacognitively monitor and regulate within and between stages of studying. In addition, because traces oper

## Intervention Studies and Metacognition

in an intervention, such as training to use concept maps for organizing information during a study period, implicitly have toggling and editing curtailed. The experimenter does not want students to substitute outlining or point-form notetaking for concept mapping, although the process of examining whether to make such a substitution and how that decision-making process itself may be adapted is the substance of metacognition. In this context, trace data will be essential in revealing whether and how students toggle and edit.

Finally, studies should generate data that allow direct inspection of students' perceptions of conditions, operations, products, evaluations, and standards. These are the inputs to metacognitive monitoring and the products that are updated by metacognitive control. Our model suggests two implications. First, prior knowledge is not a static condition. It is potentially updated throughout a task. Second, though we labeled broad categories of "prior knowledge," it remains a challenge to understand how students "collapse" or "integrate" the information in these multivariate profiles to effect self-regulation.
