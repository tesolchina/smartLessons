# From Cognitive Modeling to Self-Regulation: A Social Cognitive Career Path

My career path to understanding the source and nature of human learning started with an interest in social processes, especially cognitive modeling, and has led to the exploration of self-regulatory processes. My investigation of these processes has prompted the development of several social cognitive models: a triadic model that synthesized covert, behavioral, and environmental sources of personal feedback, a multilevel model of training that begins with observational learning and proceeds sequentially to self-regulation, and a cyclical phase model that depicts the interaction of metacognitive and motivational processes during efforts to learn.

Empirical support for each of these models is discussed, including its implications for formal and informal forms of instruction. This self-regulation research has revealed that students who set superior goals proactively, monitor their learning intentionally, use strategies effectively, and respond to personal feedback adaptively not only attain mastery more quickly, but also are more motivated to sustain their efforts to learn. Recommendations for future research are made.

It is a singular honor to have been selected to receive the E. L. Thorndike award for 2011. Thorndike envisioned the application of psychology in education as a science, and that vision has had an enduring impact on subsequent generations of researchers, including me. In this article I discuss social- and self-regulation of learning. Because this topic is broad in scope, I do not attempt to provide a comprehensive description of the field. I have, however, discussed its historical background, methodological developments, and future prospects in a previous article in American Education Research Journal (Zimmerman, 2008b). Instead I describe my personal career path as a social cognitive researcher from my initial research on cognitive modeling to my subsequent research on self-regulation of learning.

## Cognitive Modeling Research

When I began my professional career as an educational psychologist in the late 1960s, I sensed a major gap in research dealing with social cognitive aspects of students' learning. This paucity of research seemed curious because students clearly learn many fundamental concepts in influential social milieus, such as the family, the classroom, and the peer group. In addition to this gap in research on learning, I was also struck by an absence in research on students' willingness to assume personal responsibility for their academic learning and performance. To bridge these gaps, I turned to sources outside of educational psychology at the time, and I discovered the work of Albert Bandura. His research was largely unknown in educational circles when I was in graduate school. While reading Bandura and Walters's (1963) book Social Learning and Personality Development, I realized that modeling could be studied as a potent method of both formal and informal teaching. Teaching was a "hot" issue in education during that era, and Bandura's social learning theory offered a unique perspective on that topic. Modeling could be studied experimentally as an instructional method designed to enhance not only students' learning but also their motivation.

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

I was introduced to Al Bandura early in my career and came to know him personally as well as professionally. I found him to be a warm and encouraging man with a wonderful sense of humor. He invited me and my colleagues to contribute to a book that he edited on theories of psychological modeling (e.g., Rosenthal, Zimmerman, & Durning, 1970), and he has been very supportive throughout my career. I have had the honor of writing several biographies describing Al's extraordinary contributions to the field of education (Zimmerman, 2001a; Zimmerman & Schunk, 2002). Of interest, the importance of Al's research was recognized eventually by educational psychologists with his reception of the Thorndike Award in 1999.

At the time, a number of educators viewed modeling as limited in its instructional effectiveness despite its widespread use in apprentice training programs. The major problem with modeling was thought to be its reliance on response duplication (i.e., mimicry). Several developmental psychologists were especially dismissive of modeling based on presumed cognitive stage limitations of students, especially with young children (Sloban, 1968). My close colleague Ted Rosenthal and I disagreed with this perspective, and we hypothesized instead that students' vicarious learning could extend beyond simple mimicry of motoric actions if cognitive modeling methods of instruction were employed.

Cognitive models are distinguished by their display of multiple examples of problem-solving actions, which are explained or justified as they are performed such as a arithmetic strategy for "carrying" when adding numbers. To put it humorously, we sought to evolve "monkey see-monkey do" mimicry notions of modeling to higher primate cognitive forms of observational learning!

Ted and I sought to test this cognitive modeling hypothesis in an extensive series of studies. In an initial study designed to enhance the conceptual quality of elementary school students' questions to a series of cards depicting various objects (Rosenthal et al., 1970), an adult model displayed a sequence of questions that all had a specific cognitive property, such as functional questions like, "What do you use it for" and "Can you put water in this"? After watching the cognitive model ask semantically diverse but conceptually consistent questions regarding the cards, the student observers were directed to ask questions—first to the same cards addressed by the model and then to new cards.

We discovered that the observing students increased their functional questions significantly on the same cards as well as on the new cards. Clearly, the students had abstracted the key conceptual property of the questions, and they were able to generalize it to a contextually different task. These findings bear on the underlying issue: Were these results due to verbatim mimicry of the models' exact questions, or were they due their underlying conceptual property? Mimicry was found to account for only 11% of their entire vicarious learning results. These findings suggested to us that many important forms of human knowledge could be taught through cognitive modeling of the underlying abstractions of competent others (i.e., social models).

As a demanding test of the instructional power of cognitive modeling, Ted and I sought to teach developmentally linked problem-solving strategies for solving Piagetian conservation problems precociously. At the time, these numerical concepts were considered to be resistant to instruction by preoperational-stage children (Flavell, 1963).

In our cognitive modeling of conservation methodology (Rosenthal & Zimmerman, 1972; Zimmerman & Lanaro, 1974; Zimmerman & Rosenthal, 1974a), an adult model responded to an experimenter's questions about whether a flattened ball of clay had more or less clay than an unflattened ball or whether they were they equal. After rendering a correct judgment, some students observed the model asked to explain his or her answer, such as, "You didn't add or take away any clay, so they must both be the same." For the other students, the model was not asked to give a verbal explanation for the conservation judgment. Subsequently, other conservation tasks were introduced such as two equal

## From Modeling to Self-Regulation

## Defining Self-Regulated Learning (SRL)

When I began my initial research studies of SRL in the early 1980s, I drew heavily on learning experiences of my youth, especially in sports, but my first efforts to define SRL operationally were disappointing. I initially considered three possible definitions: as an ability, as a behavior, or as a self-belief. I subsequently ruled out an athletic ability definition because it couldn't explain why my efforts to learn to play baseball were much more successful than my efforts to learn to play basketball. I eliminated a behavior definition because the cognitive quality of my tennis practice proved to be as important as its physical quantity. I found a self-belief definition unconvincing because often I started a new sport, such as playing golf, with high hopes of success only to discover that these beliefs faded quickly if some degree of success was not attained readily.

Although each of these definitions focused on important self-regulatory qualities during learning, they were incomplete when considered alone. My colleagues and I sought to broaden the scope of a definition of SRL to include, in addition to personal belief, ability, and behavior, their dynamic interplay within the social and physical environment. Formally, I defined SRL as the degree to which students are metacognitively, motivationally, and behaviorally active participants in their own learning processes (Zimmerman, 1989). More specifically, self-regulated learners use specific processes that transform their preexisting abilities into task-related behavior in diverse areas of functioning. In addition to cognitive processes such as planning and goal setting, I included key metacognitive processes, such as the use of task-related strategies, imagery, or verbal self-instruction to organize and transform information more effectively (Graham & Harris, 1989; Meichenbaum, 1977; Pressley, 1977; Weinstein, Schulte, & Palmer, 1987). Finally, I also included motivational variables, such as self-efficacy, to explain the proactive striving that is so essential to SRL (Bandura & Schunk, 1981).

## A Triadic Social Cognitive Model of SRL

My initial effort to develop a social cognitive model of SRL was based in part on Bandura's triadic analysis of human functioning in terms of personal, behavioral, and environmental components, and in part from Ted's and my cognitive modeling research on the influential role of strategies and feedback. Feedback from these processes enables self-regulated learners to adapt to changes in their social and physical environments, behavioral outcomes, and covert thoughts and feelings. These three (i.e., triadic) forms of SRL are depicted in Figure 1 using three interdependent strategic feedback loops that regulate covert, behavioral, and environmental processes (Zimmerman, 1989).

Behavioral forms of self-regulation refer to self-observing one's performance and adapting it strategically. For example, the British soccer player David Beckham learned to create a tremendous bend in the flight of the ball as a result of extensive practice as a young player. He achieved this outcome by kicking the side of the ball and observing the resulting spin (Syed 2010). Environmental forms of self-regulation involve monitoring the effects of varying environmental conditions and controlling those conditions strategically. For example, when teaching Tiger Woods to become a professional golfer, his father, Earl Woods, would purposely try to distract him.

## Self-Regulated Learning Strategies

## Table 1: Self-Regulated Learning Strategies

| Categories of Strategies | Definitions |
|------------------------|-------------|
| 1. Self-evaluation | Statements indicating student-initiated evaluations of the quality or progress of their work, e.g., "I check over my work to make sure I did it correct." |
| 2. Organizing and transforming | Statements indicating student-initiated overt or covert rearrangement of instructional materials to improve learning, e.g., "I make an outline before I write my paper." |
| 3. Goal-setting and planning | Statements indicating student-initiated setting of educational goals or subgoals and planning for sequencing, timing, and completing activities related to those goals, e.g., "First I start studying 2 weeks before exams, and I pace myself." |
| 4. Seeking information | Statements indicating student-initiated efforts to secure further task information from nonsocial sources when undertaking an assignment, e.g., "Before beginning to write the paper, I go to the library to get as much information as possible concerning the topic." |
| 5. Keeping records and monitoring | Statements indicating student-initiated efforts to record events or results, e.g., "I took notes of the class discussion." "I kept a list of the words I got wrong." |
| 6. Environmental structuring | Statements indicating student-initiated efforts to select or arrange the physical setting to make learning easier, e.g., "I isolate myself from anything that distracts me." "I turned off the radio so I can concentrate on what I am doing." |
| 7. Self-consequences | Statements indicating student arrangement or imagination of rewards or punishment for success or failure, e.g., "If I do well on a test, I treat myself to a movie." |
| 8. Rehearsing and memorizing | Statements indicating student-initiated effort to memorize material by overt or covert practice, e.g., "In preparing for a math test, I keep writing the formula down until I remember it." |
| 9-11. Seeking social assistance | Statements indicating student-initiated to solicit help from peers (9), teachers (10), and adults (11), e.g., "If I have problems with math assignments, I ask a friend to help." |
| 12-14. Reviewing records | Statements indicating student-initiated efforts to reread tests (12), notes (13), or textbooks (14), to prepare for class or further testing, e.g., "When preparing for a test, I review my notes." |
| 15. Other | Statements indicating learning behavior that is initiated by other persons such as teachers or parents, and all unclear verbal responses, e.g., "I just do what the teachers says." |

Tiger Woods' father would deliberately create distractions during putting in order to teach him how to concentrate in noisy environments, such as tournament conditions (Woods & McDaniel, 1997). Covert forms of self-regulation refer to observing and adapting specific feelings and thoughts. For example, Mathew Syed (2010), a British champion ping-pong player, overcame severe performance anxiety or "choking" by practicing positive mental imagery. He would deemphasize a match by imagining all the things in his life that are more important than ping-pong. Although these three forms of self-regulation are distinctive, they are interdependent, and an optimal self-regulatory intervention would target all three forms to effect change synergistically. Thus, a central feature of this triadic model of SRL is its cyclical dependence on the three sources of feedback to guide strategic adaptations in skill.

## Identifying and Measuring SRL Processes

In an effort to capture students' self-regulatory processes reliably and validly, Manny Martinez-Pons and I developed a structured interview (Self-Regulated Learning Interview Scale [SRLIS]) that solicited students' verbal responses to typical academic problems or contexts, such as a

## Learning and Self-Regulated Learning Strategies

Because many SRL strategies are covert, our scale was designed to assess overt manifestations of these strategies, such as whether they completed assignments before deadlines or offered information beyond assigned sources. The results revealed that the teachers' ratings were highly correlated with students' reports (R: .70). Canonical correlation analyses revealed that these two measures tapped a single large underlying SRL factor, which indicates a high level of construct validity for the SRLIS. Finally, we discovered that this latent SRL factor was distinctive from measures of students' achievement, but it did correlate significantly with these measures. These findings indicated that students' SRL is not a proxy for measures of their academic achievement but rather is a separate yet correlated capability. We concluded that students' strategic use of SRL processes could be assessed reliably and validly using both student and teacher measures.

In a third study, Manny Martinez-Pons and I (Zimmerman & Martinez-Pons, 1990) studied developmental changes in self-regulation as measured by the SRLIS and measures of verbal and mathematical self-efficacy beliefs with fifth-, eighth-, and 11th-grade regular and gifted students. We found that gifted students displayed significantly higher verbal and math self-efficacy beliefs than regular students as well as greater use of four self-regulated strategies (i.e., organizing and transforming, self-consequating, seeking peer assistance, and reviewing notes). In addition, 11th-graders surpassed eighth graders, who in turn surpassed the fifth graders in both math and verbal efficacy. Significant developmental patterns were evident also on three measures of self-regulation. There were linear increases in reviewing notes, keeping records, and goal setting and planning. These findings from the three studies provide support for a triadic model of SRL. Higher levels of all three forms of SRL were reported by higher achievers and by gifted students. This study also revealed that students' self-efficacy beliefs were closely associated with their self-regulatory prowess.

## Students' Self-Efficacy Beliefs and SRL

To explore the relation between SRL and self-efficacy further, Al Bandura and I used two scales from his multidimensional measure of self-efficacy that were related to academic functioning. These were self-efficacy for SRL (for using strategies adapted from the SRLIS) and self-efficacy for academic achievement (in math, science, social studies, etc.). We hypothesized that self-efficacy for SRL will predict self-efficacy for academic achievement. We focused on students' goal setting in terms of course grades. The parents of the 10th-grade students in this study were asked to rate their grade goals for their child, and the students' actual grades were obtained at the end of the semester for their social studies course. Finally, we included the students' grade in a prior social studies course because historically prior grades are usually the best predictors of subsequent academic success.

The results of a path analysis are presented in Figure 2, and they provide support for our hypotheses. Self-efficacy for SRL was linked to self-efficacy for academic achievement, which in turn was predictive of students' grade goals, as well as their final grades. Both the students' achievement self-efficacy beliefs and their parents' grade goals were predictive of the students' grade goals. This showed that self and social variables combined to predict the students' grade goal setting and ultimately their final grades. It was interesting that the students' prior grades did not predict their subsequent grades directly but rather was mediated through their parents' goal setting. Although self-efficacy and goal scales were administered early in the fall, they increased the prediction of the final grades by 31% when compared with prior grades in social studies. Thus, students' self-efficacy to self-regulate learning was highly predictive of their goal setting and indirectly their grade attainment. Al Bandura and I (Zimmerman & Bandura, 1994) reported similar findings in a subsequent study.

## Improving Self-Regulated Learning Processes Through Social Cognitive Training

## A Multilevel Model of Self-Regulatory Training

My research on cognitive modeling training revealed that after a model was withdrawn, students were able to shift to self-direction during transfer. But how does this transfer occur? What are the underlying processes? I theorized that there were four levels in a social cognitive path to self-regulation—with the first two levels being social and the last two being self in focus (Schunk & Zimmerman, 1997; Zimmerman, 2000).

To acquire a skill at an observational level, a student must carefully watch a social model learn or perform (see Table 2). This first level of learning involves the induction of the correct form of the skill from a model's performance and descriptions, such as when a foreign language student induces the correct pronunciation of a word from a native speaker's conversation through cognitive modeling. A student's motivation to learn at an observational level can be greatly enhanced by positive vicarious consequences to the model, such as an audience's applause for a speaker. A learner has attained a skill at an observational level when he or she can discriminate qualitative levels in models' performances, such as discerning variations in the accuracy of a speaker's pronunciations.

In addition to conveying cognitive or motoric skills, models often display self-regulatory processes, such as adherence to performance standards and motivational orientations and task values. For example, a linguistic model who self-corrects a mispronunciation helps observers to discriminate and rectify common errors. Motivationally, a corrective model also conveys the high value placed on accurate speech and the need to persist in order to improve one's pronunciation.

To acquire skill at second or emulation level, a learner must duplicate the general form of a model's response on a correspondent task. Learners seldom copy the exact actions of the model, but rather they typically emulate the model's general pattern or style of functioning. For example, when elementary school children observed a model ask causal questions about a series of pictures, they subsequently emulated the model's causal style of questioning rather than specific words (Rosenthal et al., 1970). During efforts to emulate, learners can improve their accuracy and motivation if a model provides them with guidance, feedback, and social reinforcement. An emulative level of skill is achieved when observers' responses approximate the general form or style of a model's on a similar task. Although learners can induce the major features of a complex skill from observation, they require performance experiences for the skill to be incorporated into their behavioral repertoire. It is one thing to recognize the ping-pong swing of a particular champion but quite another thing to reproduce that swing oneself (Syed, 2010).

Emulation can be improved through individualized modeling and social support. For example, during participant modeling (Bandura, 1986), a model repeats selected aspects of a skill based on a learner's emulative accuracy. When a learner can perform the rudimentary aspects of a skill on the same tasks as the model, the model's support can be reduced. That learner's motivation to emulate more accurately is initiated and sustained by direct or social reinforcement by a model or instructor.

Acquiring the use of a skill on one's own usually requires more than emulation of a teacher or model on the same task; it also requires extensive deliberate practice on new tasks on one's own (Ericsson & Lehman, 1996). Deliberate practice involves performance that is structured (often by teachers) to enhance performance and self-observation. Attainment of a self-controlled level of self-regulatory skill occurs when learners master the use of a skill in structured settings outside the presence of models, such as when a pianist can play scales fluidly in the major and minor keys. At this third level, a learner's use of a skill depends on representational standards of a model's performance (e.g., covert images or verbal recollections of a teacher's performance) rather than an overt social referent (Bandura & Jeffery, 1973

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

## From Modeling to Self-Regulation

A student's attainment of a self-controlled level of functioning is motivated by self-reinforcement stemming from his or her effort to match their internal standard (Bandura, 1986).

A self-regulated level of task skill is achieved when learners can systematically adapt their performance to changing personal and contextual conditions that are present in naturalistic settings but not in practice settings. This fourth level of skill enables learners to vary the use of task strategies and make adjustments based on outcomes. Such learners can choose a strategy and adapt its features with little or no residual dependence on the model. The motivation to sustain this level of skill depends on perceptions of self-efficacy. Skills during this phase can usually be performed with minimal process monitoring, and the learners' attention can be shifted toward performance outcomes without detrimental consequences. For instance, a basketball player's attention can be shifted from the execution of a jump shot to its effectiveness in making baskets. A student's attainment of a self-regulated level of functioning is motivated by his or her self-efficacy perceptions about successfully obtaining desired outcomes (Bandura, 1986).

Thus, this multilevel sequence of self-regulatory development begins with most extensive social guidance at the first level, but this social support is systematically reduced as learners acquire self-regulatory skill. However, Level 4 functioning continues to depend on social resources on a self-initiated basis, such as when a novelist seeks advice from confidant about whether a plot or character is compelling.

Because self-regulatory skill depends on context and outcomes, new performance tasks can uncover limitations in existing skills and require additional social learning experiences. This multilevel formulation does not assume that learners must advance through the four levels in an invariant sequence as developmental stage models assume, or that once the highest level is attained it will be used universally. Instead, a multilevel model assumes that students who master each skill level in sequence will learn more easily and effectively.

Although Level 4 learners have the competence to perform self-regulatively, they may not choose to do so because of low levels of motivation (Bandura, 1997). Various aspects of self-regulation are mentally and physically demanding activities, and people may decide to forego their use if they feel tired, disinterested or uncommitted. There is a growing body of evidence indicating that the speed and quality of learners' self-regulatory development and self-motivation are enhanced significantly if learners proceed according to a multilevel sequence.

## Empirical Support for a Multilevel Training Model

To test the validity of the first and second of levels in the sequence, Anastasia Kitsantas, Tim Cleary, and I compared the two primary sources of regulation for each level (i.e., modeling for observation level and performance and social feedback for the emulation level) in two studies involving writing revision and dart throwing (Kitsantas, Zimmerman, & Cleary, 2000; Zimmerman & Kitsantas, 2002). The writing revision skill involved rewriting "wordy" sentences in nonredundant form, whereas dart throwing involved trying to hit the center ring of a circular target. The designs of the two studies were virtually identical.

Two forms of modeling were studied: modeling, which was error free, and coping modeling, which involved progressive error reduction. More specifically, the mastery model executed the sentence revision or dart-throwing strategy without missing a step, whereas the coping model would leave out a decreasing number of steps across attempts to learn. Coping modeling was expected to lead to superior learning because it provided corrective information vicariously. However, students in both modeling groups had the benefit of some form of observational learning.

## From Modeling to Self-Regulation

## Goal Setting and Self-Monitoring Studies

Goals were studied from a multilevel perspective, with groups shifting from process goals to outcome goals after automatization. Self-recording was taught to some participants in each goal group. Process-monitoring groups recorded missed strategy steps, while outcome-monitoring groups recorded target scores. The shifting goal group changed their monitoring method when shifting goals. High school girls learned strategic skills through observation and emulation before self-controlled practice.

Results across studies supported a multilevel sequential view of goal setting. Students who shifted from process to outcome goals outperformed those using exclusively process or outcome goals in both writing revision and dart-throwing. Outcome-only groups showed lowest posttest skill. Self-monitoring benefited all groups. Goal-shifting students also displayed superior self-motivation, self-efficacy beliefs, self-satisfaction, and causal attributions.

## Integrating Motivational and Metacognitive Aspects of Self-Regulation

### A Cyclical Phase Model of SRL

To address causal relations between SRL processes, motivational beliefs, and learning outcomes, Zimmerman proposed a cyclical model based on social cognitive theory. The model includes three self-regulatory phases:

1. Forethought Phase
   - Task Analysis
     - Goal setting
     - Strategic planning
   - Self-Motivation Beliefs/Values
     - Self-efficacy
     - Outcome expectancies
     - Task interest/values
     - Goal orientation

2. Performance Phase
   - Self-Control
     - Self-instruction
     - Imagery
     - Attention focusing
     - Task strategies
     - Environmental structuring
     - Help seeking
   - Self-Observation
     - Metacognitive monitoring
     - Self-recording

3. Self-Reflection Phase
   - Self-Judgment
     - Self-evaluation
     - Causal attribution
   - Self-Reaction
     - Self-satisfaction/affect
     - Adaptive/defensive

The model's cyclical properties explain repeated learning efforts. It distinguishes between proactive learners (high-quality forethought and performance processes) and reactive learners (relying on post-performance self-reflections).

Proactive learners demonstrate superior task analysis, specific goal-setting, and effective strategy planning. They are motivated by high self-efficacy beliefs, outcome expectancies, and mastery learning goals. During performance, they execute planned self-control processes and systematic self-observation.

In self-reflection, proactive learners evaluate based on specific goals and attribute errors to controllable causes like ineffective strategies. This leads to greater satisfaction and sustained learning efforts. Reactive learners, lacking specific goals, often rely on social comparison and attribute errors to uncontrollable causes like lack of ability, leading to dissatisfaction and decreased learning efforts.

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

A closely associated form of self-reactions involves adaptive or defensive inferences, which refer to conclusions about whether one needs to alter his or her approach during subsequent efforts to learn. Because of their favorable attributions and high level of self-satisfaction, proactive students are expected to make adaptive inferences for errors, such as by modifying a strategy for solving a math problem. Because of their unfavorable attributions and low level of satisfaction, reactive students resort to defensive inferences to protect themselves from future dissatisfaction and aversive affect, such as helplessness, procrastination, task avoidance, cognitive disengagement, and apathy.

These self-reactions are postulated to influence forethought processes regarding further solution efforts cyclically. The high level of self-satisfaction of proactive learners is expected to enhance various forms of self-motivation to continue cyclical efforts to learn. In addition, advantageous adaptive inferences by proactive learners are expected to lead to improved strategic planning and to shifts in goals when necessary. By contrast, the low level of self-satisfaction of reactive students reduces their motivation to continue, and their lack of adaptation greatly undermines the quality of further efforts to learn. In this cyclical way, this process model of SRL seeks to explain the persistence and sense of personal fulfillment of proactive students as well as the avoidance and self-doubts of reactive students.

## Empirical Support for a Cyclical Phase Model of SRL

To assess these SRL processes and motivational beliefs as they occur before, during, and after attempts to learn, we adapted a methodology called microanalysis (Bandura, 1997). In our approach, researchers develop context-specific information by intensive qualitative and quantitative analyses of individuals' functioning. Simple open- and close-ended questions are used in microanalyses because they are easily understood in the context in which they were asked. Because questions are brief, they minimize disruption of the participants' performance, which is viewed as a threat to validity.

To investigate the validity of the cyclical phase model, Anastasia Kitsantas and I (Kitsantas & Zimmerman, 2002) assessed the role of practice in acquiring an athletic skill. Sport and physical activities have the advantage of providing learners with personally observable outcomes, such as a ball missing a target. In an investigation of female volleyball players, we compared the self-regulatory processes of experts, nonexperts, or novices. The experts were members of the university varsity volleyball team, and the novices were girls who had participated in volleyball informally. We decided to include an intermediate expertise group as well to determine whether self-regulatory measures could detect subtle differences in self-regulation between experts and nonexperts. The nonexperts were members of the university's volleyball club for at least 3 years. We selected a skill, the overhand serve, which would be challenging for even the experts. The practice sessions were conducted individually, and the instructor showed all the participants the proper technique for the serve before asking them to practice on their own. Our microanalytic methodology involved stopping the girls at various times during the episode and asking them specific questions regarding forethought phase, performance phase, and self-reflection phase processes. After the session was completed, these young women were posttested for serving skill, strategy use, self-monitoring, self-evaluation, and self-satisfaction.

Support for the cyclical process model of SRL was found. In terms of forethought phase processes, the experts displayed significantly better goals and strategic planning than either nonexperts or novices. More experts set technique or process goals than nonexperts, who in turn surpassed novices. In terms of planning, all experts followed completely structured practice routines, whereas most nonexperts followed a partially structured routine. For example, many experts planned first to stretch, second to engage in practice jump serve swings without using the ball, and third to identify problem areas in the service motion to focus on strategically, whereas nonexperts would engage in these activities only sporadically. There was little structure evident in the practice routines of novices. The experts also reported significantly higher forethought self-efficacy beliefs, perceived instrument

volleyball-serving skill. Although causality could not be determined because the study was descriptive in design, we were able to use the various measures of SRL to predict the girls' posttest success on a demanding test of serving proficiency, which involved the ball hitting difficult sections of their opponents' court. The combined measures of self-regulation predicted 90% of the variance in the accuracy of women's postpractice serving proficiency. This striking result indicates that differences in self-regulatory phase processes and beliefs were very strongly associated with superior athletic performance. Similar findings were reported by Tim Cleary and me in a study of experts, nonexperts, and novices when practicing free throw shooting in basketball (Cleary & Zimmerman, 2001).

During a subsequent experimental study of instruction designed to enhance novice students' SRL to shoot basketball free throws, Tim Cleary, Ted Keating, and I (Cleary, Zimmerman, & Keating, 2006) provided four levels of training:

- no SRL training (control condition)
- forethought phase training (i.e., setting process goals)
- forethought and performance phase training (i.e., self-recording)
- forethought, performance, and self-reflection phase training (i.e., strategic attributions and adaptive inferences)

We hypothesized that forethought phase training, performance phase training and self-reflection phase training would improve free throw shooting accuracy additively.

In support of a cyclical phase model, we found a positive linear trend between the number of self-regulatory phases that were trained and their free throw shooting performance and their subsequent shooting adaptation. Students who received Phase 2 and 3 training displayed significantly more accurate free throws and were able to self-correct their shooting form more frequently following missed shoots than students who received no-training (control) or single phase training. Finally, participants who received three-phase training showed the most adaptive motivational pattern, which involved making strategic attributions and adaptive inferences by using personal improvement criteria during self-evaluation.

## Recommendations for Future Research

As I look forward into the 21st century, many important aspects of self-regulation of learning remain relatively unexplored. I discuss three:

1. investigating self-regulation during computer-mediated instruction
2. increasing self-regulation of learning in traditional instructional contexts
3. integrating self-regulation of learning and of performance processes

First, the role of computers in instruction is expanding rapidly, and this trend poses problems for reactive self-regulators but offers opportunities for proactive self-regulators. Reactive students struggle to learn on computers without close supervision by a teacher, whereas proactive students spontaneously use computer resources, such as highlighting to focus their attention during learning. Proactive students can also access software for planning their time use, monitoring their progress, and keeping records of key information.

Computers can be a valuable instrument for research as well as for academic instruction. For example, students' learning processes and outcomes can be logged in either hidden or overt files and can provide vital feedback to both researchers and learners. Furthermore, students' learning processes and outcomes can be stored analyzed, and graphed in various ways for students and researchers that uncover underlying strengths and deficiencies. The high quality of self-regulatory features and feedback offered by computers during learning has narrowed the gap significantly between instructional practice and cutting-edge self-regulation research. The future potential for self-regulation researchers to contribute to the development of a scientifically based "best practice" computer curriculum is limitless.

A second issue for future investigation involves growing evidence that teachers can enhance their students' self-regulation significantly during class as well as during homework. Few traditional instructors provide their students with frequent feedback in class or require them to correct their answers. As a result, many of these students overestimate their self-efficacy to learn. This problem in calibration prevents students from taking corrective courses of self-regulation, such as engaging in additional studying and self-testing.

In research on mathematics instruction with at-risk community college students, several colleagues and I developed self-reflection forms that require

A third issue requiring future researchers' attention involves the distinction between self-regulation of learning processes and self-regulation of performance processes. A focus on learning processes refers to personal efforts to acquire knowledge and skill, such as proficiency in writing or sport, whereas a focus on performance processes refers to efforts designed to control adverse behaviors, such as impulsivity, inattention, or emotional instability. The latter deficiencies in performance have been attributed to insufficient self-control or self-discipline and have been the focus of study by developmental and clinical researchers. These adverse behaviors qualify as "self-controlled" when they are managed through conscious effort, such as delay of gratification and resisting detrimental temptations. Clearly, the context differs between learning settings (acquiring positive behaviors) and performance settings (avoiding negative ones), but there is no intrinsic reason why measures of self-control should not also be predictive of students' academic achievement. There has been little integration of these two bodies of research to date, and future research needs to address this gap.

## Conclusion

My journey to understand students' self-regulation of their learning processes was influenced by many other researchers beside Al Bandura, Ted Rosenthal, and Dale Schunk. These included Lyn Corno, Steve Graham, Karen Harris, Michael Pressley, Paul Pintrich, Frank Pajares, Claire Ellen Weinstein, Philip Winne, and others listed in Table 3. Collectively, they provided a stimulating and challenging intellectual climate that permitted my research on self-regulation to flourish. For that, I am personally as well as professionally grateful.
