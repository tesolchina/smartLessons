# A Review of Self-regulated Learning: Six Models and Four Directions for Research

Ernesto Panadero*

*Departamento de Psicología Evolutiva y de la Educación, Facultad de Psicología, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain*

Self-regulated learning (SRL) includes the cognitive, metacognitive, behavioral, motivational, and emotional/affective aspects of learning. It is, therefore, an extraordinary umbrella under which a considerable number of variables that influence learning (e.g., self-efficacy, volition, cognitive strategies) are studied within a comprehensive and holistic approach. For that reason, SRL has become one of the most important areas of research within educational psychology. In this paper, six models of SRL are analyzed and compared; that is, Zimmerman; Boekaerts; Winne and Hadwin; Pintrich; Efklides; and Hadwin, Järvelä and Miller.

First, each model is explored in detail in the following aspects: (a) history and development, (b) description of the model (including the model figures), (c) empirical support, and (d) instruments constructed based on the model. Then, the models are compared in a number of aspects: (a) citations, (b) phases and subprocesses, (c) how they conceptualize (meta)cognition, motivation and emotion, (d) top-down/bottom-up, (e) automaticity, and (f) context. In the discussion, the empirical evidence from the existing SRL meta-analyses is examined and implications for education are extracted. Further, four future lines of research are proposed.

The review reaches two main conclusions. First, the SRL models form an integrative and coherent framework from which to conduct research and on which students can be taught to be more strategic and successful. Second, based on the available meta-analytic evidence, there are differential effects of SRL models in light of differences in students' developmental stages or educational levels. Thus, scholars and teachers need to start applying these differential effects of the SRL models and theories to enhance students' learning and SRL skills.

## Introduction

Self-regulated learning (SRL) is a core conceptual framework to understand the cognitive, motivational, and emotional aspects of learning. SRL has made a major contribution to educational psychology since the first papers in which scholars began to distinguish between SRL and metacognition (e.g., Zimmerman, 1986; Pintrich et al., 1993a). Since then, publications in the field of SRL theory have increased and expanded in terms of conceptual development, and there are now several models of SRL (Sitzmann and Ely, 2011).

In 2001, a theoretical review was published (Puustinen and Pulkkinen, 2001) that included the most relevant models at that time–those articulated by Boekaerts, Borkowski, Pintrich, Winne, and Zimmerman. However, the field has developed significantly since 2001. A first sign of that evolution is that there are now three meta-analyses of the effects of SRL: Dignath and Büttner (2008), Dignath et al. (2008), and Sitzmann and Ely (2011). A second indicator is that there are now new SRL models in the educational psychology field that did not exist in 2001 (e.g., Efklides, 2011; Hadwin et al., 2011, in press). And lastly, a third aspect is that there is a new handbook (Zimmerman and Schunk, 2011) that presents a variety of established methods to evaluate SRL. Compared to the previous handbook (Boekaerts et al., 2000), the recent handbook has no sections dedicated to presenting new models, being focused on specific aspects of SRL (e.g., basic domains, instructional issues, methodological issues), which shows that the field has evolved and reached a more mature phase.

## Zimmerman's Models Overview
As one of the most prolific SRL writers, Zimmerman has developed three models of SRL (Panadero and Alonso-Tapia, 2014). The first model, known as the Triadic Analysis of SRL, represents the interactions of three forms of SRL: environment, behavior and person level (Zimmerman, 1989). This model describes how SRL could be envisioned within Bandura's triadic model of social-cognition. 

The second model represents the Cyclical Phases of SRL, which explains at the individual level the interrelation of metacognitive and motivational processes. This model was presented in a chapter in the 2000 handbook, and it is usually known as Zimmerman's model. The subprocesses that belong to each phase were presented, but it was not until 2003 that these subprocesses were embedded in the figure (Zimmerman and Campillo, 2003). Finally, in Zimmerman and Moylan (2009) the model underwent some tweaks, including new metacognitive and volitional strategies in the performance phase. 

The third model, which recently has been called the Multi-Level model, represents the four stages in which students acquire their self-regulatory competency (Zimmerman, 2000). In this review, Cyclical Phases model will be analyzed, as it describes the SRL process at the same level as the models from the other authors analyzed here.

## Zimmerman's Cyclical Phases Model
Zimmerman's (2000) SRL model is organized in three phases: forethought, performance and self-reflection. In the forethought phase, the students analyze the task, set goals, plan how to reach them and a number of motivational beliefs energies the process and influence the activation of learning strategies. In the performance phase, the students actually execute the task, while they monitor how they are progressing, and use a number of self-control strategies to keep themselves cognitively engaged and motivated to finish the task. Finally, in the self-reflection phase, students assess how they have performed the task, making attributions about their success or failure. These attributions generate self-reactions that can positively or negatively influence how the students approach the task in later performances.

## Empirical Evidence Supporting Zimmerman's Cyclical Model
An overview of Zimmerman's empirical evidence can be found in his career review (Zimmerman, 2013). A special feature of Zimmerman's empirical research is the use of athletic skills, along with more typical academic skills. A number of studies have been conducted to test different aspects of Zimmerman's models (Puustinen and Pulkkinen, 2001; Zimmerman, 2013), especially the Multi-level and the Cyclical phase models. 

Zimmerman conducted work with Kitsantas and Cleary that tested the Multi-level model (Zimmerman and Kitsantas, 1997, 1999, 2002; Kitsantas et al., 2000). Those four studies can be grouped in two types:
- First, the articles published in 1997 and 1999 studied the differential effect of outcome and process goals with high school students in two different tasks dart throwing and writing, finding support for the model
- Second, the articles published in 2000 and 2002 studied the effect of observing different types of models in the development of SRL skills in dart throwing and writing

The cyclical phase model has been tested in a series of four studies:
1. Cleary and Zimmerman (2001) studied the SRL skills showed by adolescent boys who were experts, non-experts and novices in basketball, finding that experts performed more SRL actions
2. Kitsantas and Zimmerman (2002) compared college women that were experts and non-experts in volleyball, finding that the SRL skills predicted 90% variance in serving skills
3. Cleary et al. (2

## Instruments and Measurement Methods

Under Zimmerman's model umbrella, five instruments and measurements have been developed:

1. The subprocesses present in Zimmerman's model are partly based on the results found in the validation process of the Self-Regulated Learning Interview Schedule (SRLIS) (Zimmerman and Martinez-Pons, 1986, 1988).
2. Zimmerman has developed procedures to assess SRL in experimental training settings for writing and dart throwing (Zimmerman and Kitsantas, 1997, 1999).
3. Cleary and Zimmerman (2001, 2012), Kitsantas and Zimmerman (2002), DiBenedetto and Zimmerman (2010) developed microanalytic measures to assess the validity of the Cyclical Phases model.
4. Zimmerman has developed different measures of self-efficacy to self-regulate (Zimmerman and Kitsantas, 2005, 2007) and calibration measures of self-efficacy and self-evaluation (Zimmerman et al., 2011).
5. Anchored on the framework of SRL by Zimmerman and Martinez-Pons (1986, 1988), Magno (2010) developed the Academic Self-Regulation Scale (A-SRL) which has been validated analyzing its functional correlation against two well-established SRL instruments the MSLQ and the Learning and Study Strategies Inventory (LASSI) (Magno, 2011).

## Boekaerts: Different Goal Roadmaps (Top-Down/Bottom-Up) and the Role of Emotions

The work by Boekaerts is also one of the earliest in the SRL literature and can be traced back to the late 1980s (e.g., Boekaerts, 1988). Shortly after she presented her first SRL model (Boekaerts, 1991). Her work has focused in explaining the role of goals (e.g., how students activate different types of goals in relation to SRL), and she was the first to use situation-specific measures to evaluate motivation and SRL. In addition, Boekaerts has demonstrated a vast knowledge of the clinical psychology literature on self-regulation and emotion regulation (see Boekaerts, 2011).

### History and Development of the Models

Boekaerts has developed two models of SRL. First, she developed a structural model in which self-regulation was divided into six components:

1. Domain-specific knowledge and skills
2. Cognitive strategies
3. Cognitive self-regulatory strategies
4. Motivational beliefs and theory of mind
5. Motivation strategies
6. Motivational self-regulatory strategies (Boekaerts, 1996b)

These were organized around what she then considered to be the two basic mechanisms of SRL: cognitive and affective/motivational self-regulation. This model has been mainly used to:

- Gain more insight into domain-specific components of SRL
- Train teachers
- Construct new measurement instruments for research
- Design intervention programs (Boekaerts, M. personal communication to author 08/06/2014)

Second, most of Boekaerts' publications were set up to formulate a second SRL model, namely, the Adaptable Learning Model. This model was presented at the beginning of the 90s (Boekaerts, 1991, 1992). It describes the dynamic aspects of SRL, and later, evolved into the Dual Processing self-regulation model.

## Self-regulated Learning Models Review

### Research on Boekaerts' Models

The effect of prospective cognitions and emotions on learning intention was studied using the OMQ. A confirmatory factor analysis revealed that seven of the eight presupposed factors could be distinguished empirically, as the internal structure of the tested model was invariant over academic tasks and stable over a half-year period.

Gender differences in prospective cognitions and emotions were studied using the OMQ and the Confidence and Doubt scale (which measures students' feelings of confidence every 40s while performing word problems). Boys and girls were found to attend differently to math problems, especially word problems. Boys expressed higher confidence, more liking for the tasks, more positive emotions and more willingness to invest effort than girls. Using the Confidence and Doubt scale led to the conclusion that girls view solving math problems basically as applying mathematical rules.

Several interventions in Dutch secondary vocational schools focused on building metacognitive knowledge and creating opportunities to use deep-level processing. The intervention worked best for students who were already familiar with (and used) deep-level processing strategies at the beginning of the study.

Boekaerts also conducted research on the Dual Processing model and factors determining students' outcome assessments, reported effort, and attributions. Two main research lines emerged:

1. Using structural equation models, Boekaerts examined the effect of competence and value appraisals on students' outcome assessments and reported effort, as well as the influence of emotions during tasks. Students reporting invested effort after mathematics homework had initially reported task competence, producing positive emotions. Task value also substantially increased reported effort.

2. Using Neural Network Methodology, researchers examined whether writing performance quality could be predicted based on SR system characteristics. Neural networks predicted with 94-100% accuracy which students would be in poor, mid, or high performance groups, based on 56 predictors.

### Instruments and Measurement Methods

Boekaerts developed several instruments and assessment methods:

- The OMQ (On-line Motivation Questionnaire) measuring "sensitivity to learn in concrete situations"
- The Interactive Learning Group System (ILGS) for secondary vocational schools
- The Confidence and Doubt Scale for recording student motivation
- Neural network implementations for SRL prediction

### Winne and Hadwin: Exploring SRL from a Metacognitive Perspective

Winne and Hadwin's model has a strong metacognitive perspective that recognizes self-regulated students as active managers of their learning via monitoring and (meta)cognitive strategies, while asserting the goal-driven nature of SRL and effects of self-regulatory actions on motivation.

The model comprises four linked phases:

1. Task definition: generating understanding of the task
2. Goal setting and planning: generating goals and plans
3. Enacting study tactics and strategies: using actions to reach goals
4. Metacognitively adapting studying: making long-term changes in motivations, beliefs and strategies

The model uses the COPES framework to describe five facets of tasks:

- Conditions: available resources and constraints
- Operations: cognitive processes, tactics and strategies (SMART)
- Products: information created by operations
- Evaluations: feedback about fit between products and standards
- Standards: criteria against which products are monitored

Here's the cleaned and normalized Markdown:

## Winne and Hadwin's SRL Model Components

Standards that are either generated internally by the student or provided by external sources (e.g., teacher or peer feedback); and Standards: criteria against which products are monitored (definitions taken from Winne and Hadwin, 1998; Greene and Azevedo, 2007) (e.g., assessment criteria).

Furthermore, Winne (2011) model explains in detail how students' cognitive processing operates while planning, performing and evaluating a task. A crucial aspect is the use of criteria and standards to set goals, monitor and evaluate, aspects which are aligned with self-assessment research (Andrade, 2010; Panadero and Alonso-Tapia, 2013). The model describes how students constantly monitor their activities against standards and use tactics to perform tasks (Winne and Hadwin, 1998). One salient feature is that, in the model figure there is no reference to emotions, and there is only an allusion to motivation. Regardless of this Winne and Hadwin also agrees that SRL is goal-driven in nature and has built connections between his model and research by Pintrich (2003) and Wolters (2003) on regulation of motivation (Winne and Hadwin, 2008).

## Empirical Evidence Supporting Winne and Hadwin's SRL Model

Greene and Azevedo (2007) reviewed the empirical evidence for the model. Although they presented it as a theoretical review, due to the fact that they did not perform a "comprehensive review of the empirical literature" (p. 338), they reviewed a compelling number of studies (113) that provide empirical support for the model. The review covered all the aspects considered in the model, and made inferences that may have been beyond the initial scope of the work (e.g., they included a section for emotion, which is not explicitly mentioned in the original model). 

In their conclusions, they stated the model's potential for future research and pointed out four challenges that needed additional clarification:

1. Phase four and external evaluations, especially clarifying long-term changes in the students' SRL and more details on how phase four works
2. A call for Winne and Hadwin's model to incorporate the regulation of motivation, using Wolters (2003) as a reference
3. A recommendation to discuss how SRL skills develop over the life span
4. A call to consider how student characteristics (e.g., learning disabilities) might impact SRL

In later years, Winne and his team have been building empirical evidence based on work with computers that scaffold students' SRL while measuring it simultaneously (Panadero et al., 2015b). Additionally, Winne has been exploring the potential of data mining and learning analytics and their application to SRL (e.g., Winne and Baker, 2013).

## Instruments and Measurement Methods

No classical measurement instruments have been constructed based on Winne and Hadwin's model, but there are a number of scaffolding tools that measure traces of SRL using the model as theoretical framework (e.g., Winne et al., 2010). They have developed nStudy and gStudy, which are computer-supported learning environments in which the use of SRL is scaffolded while students' activities are recorded for trace and log data (Winne et al., 2010; Winne and Hadwin, 2013). 

Additionally, trace data which was brought to SRL research via Winne's earlier work (Winne, 1982; Winne and Perry, 2000) has opened up new opportunities for the temporal and sequential analysis of SRL which is showing promising new insights for the field (Azevedo et al., 2010; Malmberg et al., 2013). Furthermore, Winne has written important reflection papers on SRL measurement, especially in Winne and Perry (2000) which emphasized the importance of "on-the-fly" or "online

## Self-regulated Learning Models Review

Panadero conducted crucial empirical work on the relationship of SRL and motivation (Pintrich et al., 1993a), and his questionnaire -MSLQ- (Pintrich et al., 1993b) continues to be widely used (Schunk, 2005; Moos and Ringdal, 2012).

### History and Development of the Model

Pintrich was one of the first to analyze the relationship between SRL and motivation empirically (Pintrich and de Groot, 1990), theoretically (Pintrich, 2000), and the lack of connections between motivation and cognition (Pintrich et al., 1993a). Further, he later emphasized and clarified the differences between metacognition and self-regulation (Pintrich et al., 2000) and pointed out the areas of SRL that needed further exploration (Pintrich, 1999). In terms of the model itself, there is only one version of it, the one presented in the first handbook of SRL (Pintrich, 2000).

### Pintrich's SRL Model

According to Pintrich (2000) model, SRL is compounded by four phases: (1) Forethought, planning and activation; (2) Monitoring; (3) Control; and (4) Reaction and reflection. Each of them has four different areas for regulation: cognition, motivation/affect, behavior and context. That combination of phases and areas offers a comprehensive picture that includes a significant number of SRL processes (e.g., prior content knowledge activation, efficacy judgments, self-observations of behavior).

Furthermore, in that chapter, Pintrich (2000) explained in great detail how the different SRL components/areas for regulation are deployed in the different phases. Next how the different areas were conceptualized will be shortly presented. First, in terms of regulation of cognition, Pintrich incorporated metacognitive research such as judgments of learning and feelings of knowing. This incorporation emphasizes how important is cognition for Pintrich's. Regarding the second area, regulation of motivation and affect, Pintrich explained that motivation and affect could be regulated by the students based on his own empirical work (Pintrich et al., 1993a; Pintrich, 2004). Three years later, Wolters (2003) continued this line of work finding more empirical evidence. The third area, regulation of behavior, is based on the work by Bandura (1977, 1986, 1997) and the Triadic model by Zimmerman (1989). In this area Pintrich incorporated the "individual's attempts to control their own overt behavior" (Pintrich, 2000, p. 466). There is no other SRL model analyzed here that comprehends such area, making Pintrich's in this sense unique. And, fourth area, the regulation of context which Pintrich included because it addresses those aspects of SRL in which the students attempt to "monitor, control and regulate the (learning) context" (p. 469).

### Empirical Evidence Supporting Pintrich's SRL Model

There is no empirical evidence directly addressing Pintrich's model validation. However, there is empirical data on the validation of the MSLQ, questionnaire that is the initial empirical work in which Pintrich based his SRL model. That instrument will be analyzed in the next section. Additionally, in a special issue dedicated to his memory, Schunk (2005) reviewed Pintrich's major contributions to the SRL field identifying six different areas:

- A conceptual framework and model for SRL (just described in the previous section)
- The role of motivation in SRL with a special focus on goal orientation
- The relationship between SRL, motivation and learning outcomes
- The role of classroom contexts in SRL and motivation
- The development of SRL through empirical studies
- The development of an instrument to measure SRL (MSLQ)

## Pintrich's SRL Model and MASRL Model

The most "traditional" view of SRL comprehends the personal characteristics of the student. In Efklides' own words: "The Person level represents a generalized level of SRL functioning. It is operative when one views a task resorting mainly on memory knowledge, skills, motivational and metacognitive beliefs, and affect" (Efklides, 2011, p. 10). Therefore, it is composed of:

- cognition
- motivation 
- self-concept
- affect
- volition
- metacognition in the form of metacognitive knowledge
- metacognition in the form of metacognitive skills

A key aspect is that Efklides considers the Person level to be top-down because it is structured around students' goals for the task. In other words, the thrust of the student's goals "guides cognitive processing and the amount of effort" the student will invest, a decision based "on the interactions of the person's competences, self-concept in the task domain, motivation, and affect, vis-à-vis the perception of the task and its demands" (Efklides, 2011, p. 12).

The second level, the Task × Person level–also known as microlevel–is where the interaction between the type of task and the student's characteristics takes place. This level is bottom-up, as the metacognitive activity takes control of the student's actions, which causes activity to be "data-driven" with the focus on addressing the demands of the specific task.

To put it more simply, the student's attention moves toward the specific mechanisms of performing the task, and the general learning goal (for example, finishing a summary) is subsumed in a more specific goal (for example, checking for spelling mistakes). Here, the microlevel monitoring is the main process; motivation and affect reactions depend on the evolution of the metacognitive resources and the feedback that comes from the person's performance.

Finally, Efklides identifies four basic functions at this level:

- cognition
- metacognition  
- affect
- regulation of affect and effort

These can be conceptualized independently, vertically, or, in an integrative way, horizontally.

This distinction between the Person level and the Task × Person level is probably the most salient feature of the MARSL model. The Person level represents the general trait-oriented features of students' SRL, which are goal-driven and top-down. At this level, the MASRL model is similar to other more person-level-oriented models, such as Zimmerman's (2000). At the Task × Person level, the actions that take place are less conscious and person-oriented: the execution of the task occupies most of the student's attention and processing, and the actions are data-driven and bottom-up, showing similarities with Winne's (2011).

## Self-regulated Learning Models Review

The SSRL model by Hadwin et al. (hereinafter referred to as the SSRL model) has changed significantly from their first proposition in the 2011 handbook to the chapter in the forthcoming SRL handbook.[^2] The two biggest changes incorporated in the latest are: the authors have clarified their perspective on what is Co-regulated Learning (definition below) and they have incorporated and clarified the influence of COPES (Winne, 1997) in their model (Hadwin et al., in press).

### The Model

The SSRL model (Hadwin et al., 2011, in press) proposed the existence of three modes of regulation in collaborative settings: self-regulation (SRL), co-regulation (CoRL), and shared regulation (SSRL) (Figure 12). First, SRL in collaboration refers to the individual learner's regulatory actions (cognitive, metacognitive, motivational, emotional, and behavioral) that involve adapting to the interaction with the other group members.

Secondly, CoRL in collaboration "refers broadly to affordances and constraints stimulating the (student's) appropriation of strategic planning, enactment, reflection, and adaptation (occurring when in interaction with other students or group members)" (Hadwin et al., in press, p. 5). This regulatory level is the one that has been in the most dispute in the field, as its use has not been consistent (Panadero and Järvelä, 2015).

Finally, the third type, SSRL in collaboration, occurs when "deliberate, strategic and transactive planning, task enactment, reflection and adaptation" are taken within a group (Hadwin et al., in press, p. 5). The key difference between SSRL and CoRL is that, in the former, the regulatory actions "emerge through a series of transactive exchanges amongst group members" whilst in CoRL they are guided or directed by (a) particular group member/s.

What are the significant changes between the 2011 model version and the forthcoming version? First, the CoRL mode has been reconceptualized based on the empirical evidence (Panadero and Järvelä, 2015). Hadwin et al. (2011) proposed three types of CoRL:

1. Temporary mediation (by other than the learner) of regulated learning to promote SRL
2. Distributed regulation of each other's learning in a collaborative task
3. A microanalytic approach focusing on interactions through which social environments co-regulate learning

In their forthcoming proposal, they have shifted the focus to the effects of collaborating alone and have not discussed the microanalytic approach in such detail. Another crucial change is that they have considered the reviewed empirical evidence that CoRL and SSRL could both occur "as groups progress through different phases on their collaboration and not always SSRL nor will co-regulation happen in isolation" (Panadero and Järvelä, 2015, p. 199).

Hadwin et al. (2011) conceptualized SSRL as unfolding in four loosely sequenced and recursively linked feedback loops (Figure 13) taken from Winne and Hadwin (1998). During the first loop, groups negotiate and construct shared task perceptions based on internal and external task conditions. Through the second loop, groups set shared goals for the task and make plans about how to approach the task together. In the third loop, groups strategically coordinate their collaboration and monitor their progress. Based on this monitoring activity, the groups can change their task perceptions, goals, plans, or strategies in order to optimize their collective activity. Finally, in the fourth loop, groups evaluate and regulate for future performance. In essence, when groups engage in SSRL, they extend regulatory activity from the "I" or "you" level to regulate their collective activity in agreement (Hadwin et al., 2011).

In the forthcoming model proposal, the four-phase cycle remains, but under different labels, now using the ones proposed in Winne and Hadwin's work.

## Comparing Self-regulated Learning Models

Next, the models will be compared in the following categories. First, the models' number of cites. Second, all the models are divided into different SRL phases and subprocesses. They are compared here, to extract conclusions. Thirdly, there are three main areas that SRL explores; (meta)cognition, motivation, and emotion; therefore, their positioning in each of the six models is analyzed. And, fourth, the SRL models present significant differences in three major aspects of conceptualization: top–down/bottom–up, automaticity, and context.

## Citations and Importance in the Field

One word of advice before starting this section: the number of citations garnered is an indicator that can be influenced by aspects not related exclusively to the quality of the model. Important innovations can actually be made by models that have not received so many cites. Nevertheless, it is an interesting indicator to extract some conclusions from.

In Table 1, the number of citations per model is presented. The Efklides and SSRL models have a lower total number, as they were published recently. Nevertheless, they show promising numbers in citations per year, which indicates their relevance. The models of Boekaerts and of Winne and Hadwin's models form a second group according to their number of citations. It is important to point out that Boekaerts and Corno's (2005) study includes not only Boekaerts' model, but also information about Corno's and Kuhl's models and, especially, a reflection on SRL measurement. Therefore, it is only a partial representation of citations of Boekaerts' model, but it is her most cited paper where her model is presented. Winne and Hadwin's (1998) book is the most cited work regarding their model, but it is not the original presentation of their work, as earlier discussed. Finally, Pintrich's and Zimmerman's models, both presented in the 2000 handbook, have the highest number of citations, with Zimmerman as the most cited.

If we compare the number of the four older models, Pintrich's and Zimmerman's models have been more widely used in comparison to Boekaerts' and that of Winne and Hadwin. There are two probable causes. One is that the first ones are more comprehensive and easier to understand and apply in classrooms. With regards to the first cause, both Pintrich's and Zimmerman's models include a more complete vision of different types of subprocesses. If we compare these four models figures, it is salient that Zimmerman and Pintrich (a) present more specific subprocesses than Boekaerts and (b) include motivational and emotional aspects that are not directly presented by Winne and Hadwin. The second cause is that Boekaerts' model and Winne and Hadwin's are slightly less intuitive, and a deeper understanding of the underpinning theory is needed for a correct application. This is not to say that these two models are less relevant than the others; on the contrary, both cover in depth two critical aspects for SRL: emotion regulation and metacognition. To finalize, Moos and Ringdal's (2012) review of the teacher's role in SRL in the classroom found that Zimmerman's model has been the predominant in that line of research, as it offers "a robust explanatory lens" which might help the most when working with teachers as proposed by these authors.

## Phases and Subprocesses

All of the model authors agree that SRL is cyclical, composed of different phases and subprocesses. However, the models present different phases and subprocesses, and by identifying them we can extract some conclusions. In general terms, Puustinen and Pulkkinen's (2001) review concluded that the models they analyzed had three identifiable phases: (a) preparatory, which includes task analysis, planning, activation of goals, and setting goals; (b) performance, in which the actual task is done while monitoring an

## Models' phases

### Table 2: Models' phases comparison

| Models | Preparatory phase | Performance phase | Appraisal phase |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Boekaerts | Identification, interpretation, primary and secondary appraisal, goal setting | Goal striving | Performance feedback |
| Efklides | Task representation | Cognitive processing, performance | |
| Hadwin et al., 2011 | Planning | Monitoring, control | Regulating |
| Hadwin et al. (in press)* | Negotiating and awareness of the task | Strategic task engagement | Adaptation |
| Pintrich | Forethought, planning, activation | Monitoring, control | Reaction and reflection |
| Winne and Hadwin | Task definition, goal setting and planning | Applying tactics and strategies | Adapting metacognition |
| Zimmerman | Forethought (task analysis, self-motivation) | Performance (self-control self-observation) | Self-reflection (self-judgment, self-reaction) |

*The early draft provided by the authors did not provide the exact names for the phases but it could be implied the phases are similar to Winne and Hadwin's. Therefore, this review comparison will be based on their 2011 publication.

Two conceptualizations of the SRL phases can be distinguished. First, some models emphasize a clearer distinction among the phases and the subprocesses that occur in each of them. Zimmerman's and Pintrich's models belong to this group, each having very distinct features for each phase. Those in the second group—the Winne and Hadwin, Boekaerts, Efklides, and SSRL (in its forthcoming version) models—transmit more explicitly that SRL is an "open" process, with recursive phases, and not as delimited as in the first group. For example, Winne and Hadwin's figure does not make a clear distinction between the phases and the processes that belong to each: SRL is presented as a feedback loop that evolves over time. It is only through the text accompanying the figure that Winne and Hadwin (1998) clarified that they were proposing four phases.

One implication from this distinctive difference could be in how to intervene according to the different models. The first group of models might allow for more specific interventions because the measurement of the effects might be more feasible. For example, if a teacher recognizes that one of her students has a motivation problem while performing a task, applying some of the subprocesses presented by Zimmerman at that particular phase (e.g., self-consequences) might have a positive outcome. On the other hand, the second group of models might suggest more holistic interventions, as they perceive the SRL as a more continuous process composed of more inertially related subprocesses. This hypothesis, though, would need to be explored in the future.

## (Meta)cognition, Motivation, and Emotion

Next, the three main areas of SRL activity and how each model conceptualizes them will be explored. The interpretation is guided by the models' figures as they reveal the most important SRL aspects for each author. A classification based on different levels for the three aforementioned areas is proposed (Table 3). It is important to clarify that the levels were conceptualized, not as being close in nature, but rather, as being positions on a continuum.

### (Meta)cognition

Three levels are considered with regard to (meta)cognition. The first level includes models with a strong emphasis on (meta)cognition. The first model at this level is Winne and Hadwin's, in which the predominant processes are metacognitive: "Metacognitive monitoring is the gateway to self-regulating one's learning" (Winne and Perry, 2000, p. 540). Efklides' model includes motivational and affective aspects, but the metacognitive ones are defined in more detail at the Task ×

## Self-regulated Learning Models Review

Panadero presents SRL as a goal-driven activity. In his model, in the forethought phase, self-motivation beliefs are a crucial component; the performance phase was originally described (Zimmerman, 2000) as performance/volitional control, which indicates how important volition is; and at the self-reflection phase, self-reactions affect the motivation to perform the task in the future. According to Boekaerts, the students "interpret" the learning task and context, and then activate two different goal paths. Those pathways are the ones that lead the regulatory actions that the students do (or do not) activate (e.g., Boekaerts and Niemivirta, 2000). In addition, Boekaerts also included motivational beliefs in her models as a key aspect of SRL (see Figure 7). Finally, Pintrich (2000) also included a motivation/affect area in his model that considers aspects similar to those in Zimmerman's, but Pintrich's places a greater emphasis on metacognition. It is also important to mention that Pintrich conducted the first research that explored the role of goal orientation in SRL (Pintrich and de Groot, 1990).

The second level includes the SSRL, Efklides, and Winne and Hadwin models. SSRL included motivation in the 2011 version figure and emphasized its role in collaborative learning situations, but without differentiating motivational components in detail. Nevertheless, the authors have conducted a significant amount of research regarding motivation and its regulation at the group level (e.g., Järvelä et al., 2013). Finally, Winne and Hadwin (1998) and Efklides (2011) included motivation in their models, but it is not their main focus of analysis.

### Emotion

Three levels are proposed. In the first one (Boekaerts, 1991; Boekaerts and Niemivirta, 2000) emphasizes the influence of emotions in students' goals and how this activates two possible pathways and different strategies. For Boekaerts, ego protection plays a crucial role in the well-being pathway, and for that reason it is essential for students to have strategies to regulate their emotions, so that they will instead activate the learning pathway. At the second level, Pintrich (2000) and Zimmerman (2000) shared similar interpretations of emotions. They both put the most emphasis on the reactions (i.e., attributions and affective reactions) that occur when students self-evaluate their work during the last SRL phase. In addition, both mentioned strategies to control and monitor emotions during performance: Pintrich discusses "awareness and monitoring" and "selection and adaptation of strategies to manage" (Pintrich, 2000), and Zimmerman stated that imagery and self-consequences can be used by students to self-induce positive emotions (Zimmerman and Moylan, 2009).

Nevertheless, in the preparatory phases, neither of them mentions emotions directly. Yet, Zimmerman argues that self-efficacy, which is included in his forethought phase, is a better predictor of performance at that phase than emotions or emotion regulation (Zimmerman, B. J. personal communication with the author, 28/02/2014). The SSRL model includes emotion in its 2011 version figure (Hadwin et al., 2011), but the subprocesses that underlie the regulation of emotion are not specified. Nonetheless, these authors clearly argue that collaborative learning situations present significant emotional challenges, and they have conducted empirical studies exploring this matter (e.g., Järvenoja and Järvelä, 2009; Koivuniemi et al., 2017). Finally, Efklides (2011) and Winne and Hadwin (e.g., Winne, 2011) mention the role of emotions in SRL [e.g., "affect may directly impact metacognitive experiences as in the case of

## Self-regulated Learning Models Review

## Top-Down/Bottom-Up Processing

Panadero notes that this terminology is limiting. A vital characteristic of SRL is cycles of information flow rather than one-directional flow of information. Some cycles are internal to the person and others cross the boundary between person and environment.

Zimmerman and Winne do not consider TD/BU to be applicable to their models, as the recursive cycles of feedback during performance generate self-regulation and changes in the specificity of the goals.

As Pintrich's (2000) model is goal-driven, it could be assumed that it conceptualizes top-down motivation as coming from personal characteristics, as proposed by Efklides (2011). Nevertheless, Pintrich also included goal orientation, which implicates performance and avoidance goals, which has a connection to Boekaerts' well-being pathway, especially avoidance goals. Therefore, it is difficult to discern with any precision what the interpretation of TD/BU would be for his model. The SSRL model (Hadwin et al., 2011) has not yet clarified this issue, though a stance similar to that of Winne and Hadwin could be presupposed.

## Automaticity

In SRL, automaticity usually refers to underlying processes that have become an automatic response pattern (Bargh and Barndollar, 1996; Moors and De Houwer, 2006; Winne, 2011). It is frequently used to refer to (meta)cognitive processes: some authors maintain that, for SRL to occur, some processes must become automatic so that the student can have less cognitive load and can then activate strategies (e.g., Zimmerman and Kitsantas, 2005; Winne, 2011). However, it can also refer to motivational and emotional processes that occur without student's awareness (e.g., Boekaerts, 2011).

Winne (2011) stated:
> Most cognition is carried out without learners needing either to deliberate about doing it or to control fine-grained details of how it unfolds...Some researchers describe such cognition as "unconscious" but I prefer the label implicit...Because so much of cognitive activity is implicit, learners are infrequently aware of their cognition. There are two qualifications. First, cognition can change from implicit to explicit when errors and obstacles arise. But, second, unless learners trace cognitive products as tangible representations -"notes to self" or underlines that signal discriminations about key ideas, for example-the track [of] cognitive of events across time can be unreliable, a fleeting memory (p. 18).

Efklides (2011) indicated:
> This conception of the SRL functioning at the Task × Person level presupposes a cognitive architecture in which there are conscious analytic processes and explicit knowledge as well as non-conscious automatic processes and implicit knowledge that have a direct effect on behavior (p. 13).

Boekaerts also assumed that automaticity can play a crucial role in the different pathways that students might activate: "Bargh's (1990) position is that goal activation can be automatic or deliberate and Bargh and Barndollar (1996) demonstrated that some goals may be activated or triggered directly by environmental cues, outside the awareness of the individual" (Boekaerts and Niemivirta, 2000, p. 422).

Pintrich (2000) specified: "At some level, this process of activation of prior knowledge can and does happen automatically and without conscious thought" (p. 457).

Zimmerman and Moylan (2009) asserted:
> In terms of their impact on forethought, process goals are designed to incorporate strategic planning-combining two key task analysis processes. With studying and/or practice, students will eventually use the strategy automatically. Automization occurs when a strategy can be executed without close metacognitive monitoring. At the point of automization, students can benefit from outcome feedback because it helps them to

## Self-regulated Learning Models Review

Context is important across several SRL models (Panadero, 1996; Pintrich, 2000; Efklides, 2011) in two key ways:
1. Adapting to task demands
2. Being part of feedback loops as students receive and adapt to contextual information

While all models include context as a significant variable, limited research has explored how different contexts or task contexts affect SRL, with the exception of Hadwin, Järvelä, and Miller's work.

## Discussion

The aim of this review was to compare educational psychology models of SRL. The included models have been presented and compared, leading to several conclusions.

### Meta-Analytical Empirical Evidence for the Models

All models have empirical evidence supporting the validity of their main aspects, with significant overlap due to shared processes. For example, self-efficacy is crucial in multiple models (e.g., Pintrich, 2000; Zimmerman, 2000). Rather than disentangling individual contributions, this analysis focuses on transversal findings from meta-analyses in the SRL field.

Four relevant meta-analyses have been conducted:

- Hattie et al. (1996) recommended that training be contextual, use domain-specific tasks, and promote learner activity and metacognitive awareness
- Dignath et al. (2008) and Dignath and Büttner (2008) found that:
  - For primary school, interventions based on social-cognitive theories showed higher effect sizes
  - For secondary education, metacognitive theoretical backgrounds were more effective
- Sitzmann and Ely (2011) found that:
  - Constructs included in more SRL theories had stronger effects on learning
  - Significant relationships exist between different models
  - Goal level, persistence, effort, and self-efficacy had the strongest effects on learning

Key conclusions from these meta-analyses:

1. SRL provides a powerful framework for understanding variables affecting learning and their interactions
2. Well-designed SRL interventions successfully improve student learning
3. SRL intervention effects vary by educational level:
   - Social-cognitive approaches work better in primary education
   - Metacognitive aspects become more important in secondary education
   - For higher education and workplace training, motivational factors (goals, persistence, effort, self-efficacy) are crucial predictors

These findings align with Richardson et al. (2012), who found self-efficacy was the highest predictor, goal-setting boosted effort regulation, and multifaceted interventions may be more effective.

## Self-regulated Learning Models Review

Robbins et al. (2004) found that the best predictors for GPA were academic self-efficacy and achievement motivation. Therefore, there seems to be a tendency for higher education students to have better results if the interventions are aiming at motivational and emotional aspects—i.e., self-efficacy and goal setting. It could, thus, be hypothesized that models with an emphasis on motivation and emotion (e.g., Boekaerts, Pintrich, and Zimmerman) might have a higher impact. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that the conclusions regarding higher education students are not built on meta-analyses that explicitly compared different SRL models (i.e., theoretical background) interventions as are the ones for primary and secondary education.

Finally, there was another interesting finding from Dignath and colleagues meta-analyses. They found that SRL interventions, including group work, were detrimental for primary students but that they had positive impact in secondary education students (Dignath and Büttner, 2008). This finding implies that the implementation of SSRL model interventions should be carefully conducted in primary education to try to maximize positive effects. Additionally, SSRL interventions might be needed in secondary and higher education, where the amount of group work increases.

### Educational Implications

Four educational implications will be discussed. First, if we examined the psychological correlates (e.g., self-efficacy, effort regulation, procrastination) that influence academic performance (Richardson et al., 2012), the conclusion is that the vast majority of these correlates are included in the SRL models. Additionally, SRL interventions promote students' learning (Dignath et al., 2008; Rosário et al., 2012). Therefore, a first implication is that teachers need to receive training on SRL theory and models to understand how they can maximize their students' learning (Paris and Winograd, 1999; Moos and Ringdal, 2012; Dignath-van Ewijk et al., 2013). There are three ways of intervening:

1. Pre-service teachers should receive pedagogical training for their future adaptation to the workplace. There is a significant number of studies conducted with pre-service teachers (e.g., Kramarski and Michalsky, 2009; Michalsky and Schechter, 2013), however, there is need for longitudinal studies exploring the final outcomes of such training when they start working.
2. In-service teachers also need to receive training on SRL, as they most probably did not receive any during their pre-service preparation (Moos and Ringdal, 2012).
3. Teachers should gain SRL expertise themselves as learners, as this will impact their knowledge and pedagogic skills (Moos and Ringdal, 2012).

A second implication relates to how to teach SRL at different educational levels. Different models work better at different educational levels (Dignath and Büttner, 2008). Furthermore, another review shows that teachers at different educational levels used different approaches to SRL (Moos and Ringdal, 2012), but not in the expected direction. These authors found that:
- Higher education teachers tend to focus on the course content, providing limited opportunities for scaffolding SRL
- Secondary teachers offer more of those opportunities but do not formulate explicit instructions in terms of SRL
- Primary teachers implement more SRL practices

There is, therefore, a misalignment between what SRL research says about its implementation at different educational levels (Dignath and Büttner, 2008), and what teachers actually do in their classroom (Moos and Ringdal, 2012). This brings us back to the previous implication: more teacher training is then needed, however, it needs to be tailored so that the interventions take the differential effects of SRL models into account.

A third implication is related to creating environments that leads students' actions toward learning. All of the models consider SRL as goal

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

Second, more fine-grained studies should be conducted to understand how the specifics of SRL work. Although SRL models provide a quite specific picture of their processes, there is still much needed to understand SRL mechanisms more precisely (e.g., how self-reflection works, interactions that leads to attributions). This could be achieved through solid experimental designs controlling for strange variables.

Third, longitudinal research on the development of SRL skills throughout the life span is needed, especially regarding how SRL applies to adults in their workplace (Sitzmann and Ely, 2011). There is a compelling amount of research on SRL development during formal education years (Paris and Newman, 1990; Ley and Young, 1998; Núñez et al., 2013). However, we need to further implement longitudinal studies that cover a significant amount of years, and emphasize the role of SRL in adult life. In terms of the latter, our call would be to first test if the available models are valid, rather than developing a new SRL model (Sitzmann and Ely, 2011). Additionally, more longitudinal research on SRL, which focuses on its development during more specific and shorter periods of time, is needed. For example, studies that focus on one specific crucial academic year (e.g., first year of university). The research on learning diaries (Schmitz et al., 2011) is a very promising stream of research that allows for extraction of information in a longitudinal manner.

Fourth, new insights into SRL processes will come from recent developments in SRL measurement (Panadero et al., 2015b). The introduction of computers in SRL research, not only to measure but also to scaffold SRL, is showing promising results. This will provide more tailored interventions and learning environments over the coming years, which should be integrated into the existent body of knowledge.

## Conclusion

Self-regulated learning is a broad field that provides an umbrella to understand variables that influence students' learning. Over the last two decades, SRL has become one of the major areas of research in educational psychology, and the current advances in the field are a signal that its relevance will continue. One conclusion from this review is that the SRL models are beneficial for interventions under different circumstances and populations, an aspect that need to be further considered by researchers and practitioners. Additionally, SRL models address a variety of research areas (e.g., emotion regulation, collaborative learning) and, therefore, researchers can utilize those that better suit their research goals and focus. Having a repertoire of models is enriching because researchers and teachers can tailor their interventions more effectively. Finally, I would like to issue a call for a new generation of researchers to take the lead in developing new approaches, measures, and, of course, SRL models—or to continue validating the ones that already exist. These future advances should promote changes in our understanding of SRL and the means through which research is conducted.
