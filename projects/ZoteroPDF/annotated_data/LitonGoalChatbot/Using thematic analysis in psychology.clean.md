# Using thematic analysis in psychology

Virginia Braun¹ and Victoria Clarke²  
¹University of Auckland and ²University of the West of England

Thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated, rarely acknowledged, yet widely used qualitative analytic method within psychology. In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data. We outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and ontological positions. We then provide clear guidelines to those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and flexible method for qualitative research in and beyond psychology.

Key words: epistemology; flexibility; patterns; qualitative psychology; thematic analysis

Thematic analysis is a poorly demarcated and rarely acknowledged, yet widely used qualitative analytic method (Boyatzis, 1998; Roulston, 2001) within and beyond psychology. In this paper, we aim to fill what we, as researchers and teachers in qualitative psychology, have experienced as a current gap - the absence of a paper which adequately outlines the theory, application and evaluation of thematic analysis, and one which does so in a way accessible to students and those not particularly familiar with qualitative research. Therefore, in this paper we discuss theory and method for thematic analysis, and clarify the similarities and differences between different approaches that share features in common with a thematic approach.

Qualitative approaches are incredibly diverse, complex and nuanced (Holloway and Todres, 2003), and thematic analysis should be seen as a foundational method for qualitative analysis. It is the first qualitative method of analysis that researchers should learn, as it provides core skills that will be useful for conducting many other forms of qualitative analysis. Indeed, Holloway and Todres (2003: 347) identify 'thematizing meanings' as one of a few shared generic skills across qualitative analysis. For this reason, Boyatzis (1998) characterizes it, not as a specific method, but as a tool to use across different methods. Similarly, Ryan and Bernard (2000) locate thematic coding as a process performed within 'major' analytic traditions (such as grounded theory), rather than a specific approach in its own right. We argue thematic analysis should be considered a method in its own right.

One of the benefits of thematic analysis is its flexibility. Qualitative analytic methods can be roughly divided into two camps. Within the first, there are those tied to, or stemming from, a particular theoretical or epistemological position. For some of these - such as conversation analysis (CA; eg, Hutchby and Wooffitt, 1998) and interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA; eg, Smith and Osborn, 2003) - there is (as yet) relatively limited variability in how the method is applied, within that framework. In essence, one recipe guides analysis. For others of these - such as grounded theory (Glaser, 1992; Strauss and Corbin, 1998), discourse analysis (DA; eg, Burman and Parker, 1993; Potter and Wetherell, 1987; Willig, 2003) or narrative analysis (Murray, 2003; Riessman, 1993) - there are different manifestations of the method, from within the broad theoretical framework. Second, there are methods that are essentially independent of theory and epistemology, and can be applied across a range of theoretical and epistemological approaches. Although often (implicitly) framed as a realist/experiential method (Aronson, 1994; Roulston, 2001), thematic analysis is actually firmly in the second camp, and is compatible with both essentialist and constructionist paradigms within psychology (we

Here's the cleaned and normalized Markdown:

Qualitative psychologists need to be clear about what they are doing and why, and to include the often-omitted 'how' they did their analysis in their reports (Attride-Stirling, 2001).

In this paper we outline:
- what thematic analysis is
- a 6-phase guide to performing thematic analysis
- potential pitfalls to avoid when doing thematic analysis
- what makes good thematic analysis
- advantages and disadvantages of thematic analysis

Throughout, we provide examples from the research literature, and our own research. By providing examples, we show the types of research questions and topics that thematic analysis can be used to study.

Before we begin, we need to define a few of the terms used throughout the paper. Data corpus refers to all data collected for a particular research project, while data set refers to all the data from the corpus that are being used for a particular analysis.

There are two main ways of choosing the data set (which approach you take depends on whether you are coming to the data with a specific question or not — see 'A number of decisions' below):

1. The data set may consist of many, or all, individual data items within your data corpus. For example, in a project on female genital cosmetic surgery, Virginia's data corpus consists of interviews with surgeons, media items on the topic, and surgeon websites. For any particular analysis, her data set might just be the surgeon interviews, just the websites (Braun, 2005b), or it might combine surgeon data with some media data (eg, Braun, 2005a).

2. The data set might be identified by a particular analytic interest in some topic in the data, and the data set then becomes all instances in the corpus where that topic is referred. So in Virginia's example, if she was interested in how 'sexual pleasure' was talked about, her data set would consist of all instances across the entire data corpus that had some relevance to sexual pleasure.

These two approaches might sometimes be combined to produce the data set. Data item is used to refer to each individual piece of data collected, which together make up the data set or corpus. A data item in this instance would be an individual surgeon interview, a television documentary, or one particular website. Finally, data extract refers to an individual coded chunk of data, which has been identified within, and extracted from, a data item. There will be many of these, taken from throughout the entire data set, and only a selection of these extracts will feature in the final analysis.

## What is thematic analysis?

Thematic analysis is a method for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns (themes) within data. It minimally organizes and describes your data set in (rich) detail. However, frequently it goes further than this, and interprets various aspects of the research topic (Boyatzis, 1998). The range of different possible thematic analyses will further be highlighted in relation to a number of decisions regarding it as a method.

Thematic analysis is widely used, but there is no clear agreement about what thematic analysis is and how you go about doing it (see Attride-Stirling, 2001; Boyatzis, 1998; Tuckett, 2005, for other examples). It can be seen as a very poorly 'branded' method, in that it does not appear to exist as a 'named' analysis in the same way that other methods do (eg, narrative analysis, grounded theory). In this sense, it is often not explicitly claimed as the method of analysis, when, in actuality, we argue that a lot of analysis is essentially thematic — but is either claimed as something else (such as DA, or even content analysis (eg, Meehan et al., 2000)) or not identified as any particular method at all — for example, data were 'subjected to qualitative analysis for commonly recurring themes' (Braun and Wilkinson, 2003: 30).

If we do not know how people went about analysing their data, or what assumptions informed their analysis, it is difficult to evaluate their

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

A theme captures something important about the data in relation to the research question, and represents some level of patterned response or meaning within the data set. In our experience, grounded theory seems increasingly to be used in a way that is essentially grounded theory 'lite' - as a set of procedures for coding data very much akin to thematic analysis. Such analyses do not appear to fully subscribe to the theoretical commitments of a 'full-fat' grounded theory, which requires analysis to be directed towards theory development (Holloway and Todres, 2003).

We argue, therefore, that a 'named and claimed' thematic analysis means researchers need not subscribe to the implicit theoretical commitments of grounded theory if they do not wish to produce a fully worked-up grounded-theory analysis.

The term 'thematic DA' is used to refer to a wide range of pattern-type analysis of data, ranging from thematic analysis within a social constructionist epistemology (ie, where patterns are identified as socially produced, but no discursive analyse is conducted), to forms of analysis very much akin to the interpretative repertoire form of DA (Clarke, 2005). Thematic decomposition analysis (eg, Stenner, 1993; Ussher and Mooney-Somers, 2000) is a specifically named form of 'thematic' DA, which identifies patterns (themes, stories) within data, and theorizes language as constitutive of meaning and meaning as social.

These different methods share a search for certain themes or patterns across an (entire) data set, rather than within a data item, such as an individual interview or interviews from one person, as in the case of biographical or case-study forms of analysis, such as narrative analysis (eg, Murray, 2003; Riessman, 1993). In this sense, they more or less overlap with thematic analysis. As thematic analysis does not require the detailed theoretical and technological knowledge of approaches, such as grounded theory and DA, it can offer a more accessible form of analysis, particularly for those early in a qualitative research career.

In contrast to IPA or grounded theory (and other methods like narrative analysis DA or CA), thematic analysis is not wedded to any pre-existing theoretical framework, and therefore it can be used within different theoretical frameworks (although not all), and can be used to do different things within them. Thematic analysis can be an essentialist or realist method, which reports experiences, meanings and the reality of participants, or it can be a constructionist method, which examines the ways in which events, realities, meanings, experiences and so on are the effects of a range of discourses operating within society.

It can also be a 'contextualist' method, sitting between the two poles of essentialism and constructionism, and characterized by theories, such as critical realism (eg, Willig, 1999), which acknowledge the ways individuals make meaning of their experience, and, in turn, the ways the broader social context impinges on those meanings, while retaining focus on the material and other limits of 'reality'. Therefore, thematic analysis can be a method that works both to reflect reality and to unpick or unravel the surface of 'reality'. However, it is important that the theoretical position of a thematic analysis is made clear, as this is all too often left unspoken (and is then typically a realist account). Any theoretical framework carries with it a number of assumptions about the nature of the data, what they represent in terms of the 'the world', 'reality', and so forth. A good thematic analysis will make this transparent.

## A number of decisions

Thematic analysis involves a number of choices which are often not made explicit (or are certainly typically not discussed in the method section of papers), but which need explicitly to be considered and discussed. In practice, these questions should be considered before analysis (and sometimes even collection) of the data begins, and there needs to be an ongoing reflexive dialogue on the part of the researcher or researchers with regards to these issues, throughout the analytic process

## Determining Theme Prevalence and Analysis Approaches

There is no right or wrong method for determining prevalence. Part of the flexibility of thematic analysis is that it allows you to determine themes (and prevalence) in a number of ways. What is important is that you are consistent in how you do this within any particular analysis.

There are various 'conventions' for representing prevalence in thematic (and other qualitative) analysis that does not provide a quantified measure (unlike much content analysis, Wilkinson, 2000) - for instance: 'the majority of participants' (Meehan et al., 2000: 372), 'many participants' (Taylor and Ussher, 2001: 298), or 'a number of participants' (Braun et al., 2003: 249). Such descriptors work rhetorically to suggest a theme really existed in the data, and to convince us they are reporting truthfully about the data. But do they tell us much? This is perhaps one area where more debate is needed about how and why we might represent the prevalence of themes in the data, and, indeed, whether, if, and why prevalence is particularly important.

### Rich Description vs. Detailed Account

It is important to determine the type of analysis you want to do, and the claims you want to make, in relation to your data set. For instance, you might wish to provide a rich thematic description of your entire data set, so that the reader gets a sense of the predominant or important themes. In this case, the themes you identify, code, and analyse would need to be an accurate reflection of the content of the entire data set. In such an analysis, some depth and complexity is necessarily lost (particularly if you are writing a short dissertation or article with strict word limits), but a rich overall description is maintained. This might be a particularly useful method when you are investigating an under-researched area, or you are working with participants whose views on the topic are not known.

An alternative use of thematic analysis is to provide a more detailed and nuanced account of one particular theme, or group of themes, within the data. This might relate to a specific question or area of interest within the data (a semantic approach) or to a particular 'latent' theme across the whole or majority of the data set. An example of this would be Victoria's talk show paper (Clarke and Kitzinger, 2004), which examined normalization in lesbians' and gay men's accounts of parenting.

### Inductive vs. Theoretical Thematic Analysis

Themes or patterns within data can be identified in one of two primary ways in thematic analysis:
- In an inductive or 'bottom up' way (eg, Frith and Gleeson, 2004)
- In a theoretical or deductive or 'top down' way (eg, Boyatzis, 1998; Hayes, 1997)

An inductive approach means the themes identified are strongly linked to the data themselves (Patton, 1990). In this approach, if the data have been collected specifically for the research (eg, via interview or focus group), the themes identified may bear little relation to the specific questions that were asked of the participants. They would also not be driven by the researcher's theoretical interest in the area or topic. Inductive analysis is therefore a process of coding the data without trying to fit it into a pre-existing coding frame, or the researcher's analytic preconceptions. In this sense, this form of thematic analysis is data-driven.

However, it is important to note that researchers cannot free themselves of their theoretical and epistemological commitments, and data are not coded in an epistemological vacuum.

In contrast, a 'theoretical' thematic analysis would tend to be driven by the researcher's theoretical or analytic interest in the area, and is thus more explicitly analyst-driven. This form of thematic analysis tends to provide less a rich description of the data overall, and more a detailed analysis of some aspect of the data.

### Semantic vs. Latent Themes

Another decision

Here's the cleaned and normalized Markdown:

## Epistemology: essentialist/realist versus constructionist thematic analysis

As we have argued, thematic analysis can be conducted within both realist/essentialist and constructionist paradigms, although the outcome and focus will be different for each. The question of epistemology is usually determined when a research project is being conceptualized, although epistemology may also raise its head again during analysis, when the research focus may shift to an interest in different aspects of the data.

The research epistemology guides what you can say about your data, and informs how you theorize meaning. For instance, with an essentialist/realist approach, you can theorize motivations, experience, and meaning in a straightforward way, because a simple, largely unidirectional relationship is assumed between meaning and experience and language (language reflects and enables us to articulate meaning and experience) (Potter and Wetherell, 1987; Widdicombe and Wooffitt, 1995).

In contrast, from a constructionist perspective, meaning and experience are socially produced and reproduced, rather than inhering within individuals (Burr, 1995). Therefore, thematic analysis conducted within a constructionist framework cannot and does not seek to focus on motivation or individual psychologies, but instead seeks to theorize the sociocultural contexts, and structural conditions, that enable the individual accounts that are provided. Thematic analysis that focuses on 'latent' themes tends to be more constructionist, and it also tends to start to overlap with thematic DA at this point. However, not all 'latent' thematic analysis is constructionist.

## The many questions of qualitative research

It is worth briefly noting that qualitative research involves a series of questions, and there is a need to be clear about the relationship between these different questions. First, there is the overall research question or questions that drive the project. A research question might be very broad (and exploratory), such as 'how is lesbian and gay parenting constructed?' or 'what are the meanings of the vagina?'. Narrower research questions might be 'how and why is lesbian and gay parenting normalized?' (Clarke and Kitzinger, 2004), or 'what are the discourses around vaginal size?' (see Braun and Kitzinger, 2001). These narrow questions may be part of a broader overarching research question, and if so, the analyses they inform would also provide answers to the overall research question. Although all projects are guided by research questions, these may also be refined as a project progresses.

Second, if data from interviews or focus groups have been collected, there are the questions that participants have responded to. Finally, there are the questions that guide the coding and analysis of the data. There is no necessary relationship between these three, and indeed, it is often desirable that there is a disjuncture between them. Some of the worst examples of 'thematic' analysis we have read have simply used the questions put to participants as the 'themes' identified in the 'analysis' - although in such instances, no analysis has really been done at all!

To sum up, thematic analysis involves the searching across a data set - be that a number of interviews or focus groups, or a range of texts - to find repeated patterns of meaning. The exact form and product of thematic analysis varies, as indicated above, and so it is important that the questions outlined above are considered before and during thematic analyses. Those approaches which consider specific aspects, latent themes and are constructionist tend to often cluster together, while those that consider meanings across the whole data set, semantic themes, and are realist, often cluster together. However, there are no hard-and-fast rules in relation to this, and different combinations are possible. What is important is that the finished product contains an account - not necessarily that detailed - of what was done, and why.

## Doing thematic analysis: a step-by-step guide

Some of the phases of thematic analysis are similar to the phases of other qualitative research, so these stages are not necessarily all unique to thematic analysis.

Here's the cleaned and normalized Markdown:

## Phase 1: Familiarizing Yourself with Your Data

When you engage in analysis, you may have collected the data yourself, or they may have been given to you. If you collected them through interactive means, you will come to the analysis with some prior knowledge of the data, and possibly some initial analytic interests or thoughts. Regardless, it is vital that you immerse yourself in the data to the extent that you are familiar with the depth and breadth of the content. Immersion usually involves 'repeated reading' of the data, and reading the data in an active way - searching for meanings, patterns and so on.

It is ideal to read through the entire data set at least once before you begin your coding, as ideas and identification of possible patterns will be shaped as you read through. Whether or not you are aiming for an overall or detailed analysis, are searching for latent or semantic themes, or are data- or theoretically-driven will inform how the reading proceeds. Regardless, it is important to be familiar with all aspects of your data. At this phase, one of the reasons why qualitative research tends to use far smaller samples than, for example, questionnaire research will become apparent - the reading and re-reading of data is time-consuming. It is, therefore, tempting to skip over this phase, or be selective. We would strongly advise against this, as this phase provides the bedrock for the rest of the analysis.

During this phase, it is a good idea to start taking notes or marking ideas for coding that you will then go back to in subsequent phases. Once you have done this, you are ready to begin the more formal coding process. In essence, coding continues to be developed and defined throughout the entire analysis.

### Transcription of Verbal Data

If you are working with verbal data, such as interviews, television programmes or political speeches, the data will need to be transcribed into written form in order to conduct a thematic analysis. The process of transcription, while it may seem time-consuming, frustrating, and at times boring, can be an excellent way to start familiarizing yourself with the data (Riessman, 1993). Further, some researchers even argue it should be seen as 'a key phase of data analysis within interpretative qualitative methodology' (Bird, 2005: 227), and recognized as an interpretative act, where meanings are created, rather than simply a mechanical act of putting spoken sounds on paper (Lapadat and Lindsay, 1999).

| Phase | Description of the process |
|-------|---------------------------|
| 1. Familiarizing yourself with your data | Transcribing data (if necessary), reading and re-reading the data, noting down initial ideas. |
| 2. Generating initial codes | Coding interesting features of the data in a systematic fashion across the entire data set, collating data relevant to each code. |
| 3. Searching for themes | Collating codes into potential themes, gathering all data relevant to each potential theme. |
| 4. Reviewing themes | Checking if the themes work in relation to the coded extracts (Level 1) and the entire data set (Level 2), generating a thematic 'map' of the analysis. |
| 5. Defining and naming themes | Ongoing analysis to refine the specifics of each theme, and the overall story the analysis tells, generating clear definitions and names for each theme. |
| 6. Producing the report | The final opportunity for analysis. Selection of vivid, compelling extract examples, final analysis of selected extracts, relating back of the analysis to the research question and literature, producing a scholarly report of the analysis. |

Various conventions exist for transforming spoken texts into written texts (see Edwards and Lampert, 1993; Lapadat and Lindsay, 1999). Some systems of transcription have been developed for specific forms of analysis - such as the 'Jefferson' system for CA (see Atkinson and Heritage, 1984; Hutchby and Wooffitt, 1998). However, thematic analysis, even constructionist thematic

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

### Phase 2 (continued)

Themes will depend on the data, but in the latter, you might approach the data with specific questions in mind that you wish to code around. It will also depend on whether you are aiming to code the content of the entire data set, or whether you are coding to identify particular (and possibly limited) features of the data set. Coding can be performed either manually or through a software programme (see, eg, Kelle, 2004; Seale, 2000, for discussion of software programmes).

Work systematically through the entire data set, giving full and equal attention to each data item, and identify interesting aspects in the data items that may form the basis of repeated patterns (themes) across the data set. There are a number of ways of actually coding extracts. If coding manually, you can code your data by writing notes on the texts you are analysing, by using highlighters or coloured pens to indicate potential patterns, or by using 'post-it' notes to identify segments of data.

You may initially identify the codes, and then match them with data extracts that demonstrate that code, but it is important in this phase to ensure that all actual data extracts are coded, and then collated together within each code. This may involve copying extracts of data from individual transcripts or photocopying extracts of printed data, and collating each code together in separate computer files or using file cards. If using computer software, you code by tagging and naming selections of text within each data item.

Key advice for this phase is:
- Code for as many potential themes/patterns as possible (time permitting) - you never know what might be interesting later
- Code extracts of data inclusively - ie, keep a little of the surrounding data if relevant, a common criticism of coding is that the context is lost (Bryman, 2001)
- Remember that you can code individual extracts of data in as many different 'themes' as they fit into - so an extract may be uncoded, coded once, or coded many times, as relevant

Note that no data set is without contradiction, and a satisfactory thematic 'map' that you will eventually produce - an overall conceptualization of the data patterns, and relationships between them - does not have to smooth out or ignore the tensions and inconsistencies within and across data items. It is important to retain accounts that depart from the dominant story in the analysis, so do not ignore these in your coding.

### Phase 3: searching for themes

Phase 3 begins when all data have been initially coded and collated, and you have a long list of the different codes that you have identified across the data set. This phase, which re-focuses the analysis at the broader level of themes, rather than codes, involves sorting the different codes into potential themes, and collating all the relevant coded data extracts within the identified themes.

Essentially, you are starting to analyse your codes and consider how different codes may combine to form an overarching theme. It may be helpful at this phase to use visual representations to help you sort the different codes into themes. You might use tables, or mind-maps, or write the name each code (and a brief description) on a separate piece of paper and play around with organizing them into theme-piles. A thematic map of this early stage can be seen in Figure 2 (the examples in Figures 2-4 come from the analysis presented in Braun and Wilkinson, 2003 of women's talk about the vagina).

This is when you start thinking about the relationship between codes, between themes, and between different levels of themes (eg, main overarching themes and sub-themes within them). Some initial codes may go on to form main themes, whereas others may form sub-themes, and others still may be discarded. At this stage, you may also have a set of codes that do not seem to belong anywhere, and it is perfectly acceptable to create a 'theme' called 'miscellaneous' to house the codes - possibly temporarily - that do not seem to fit into your main themes.

You end this phase with

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

## Phase 4: Reviewing Themes

Phase 4 begins when you have devised a set of candidate themes, and it involves the refinement of those themes. During this phase, it will become evident that some candidate themes are not really themes (e.g., if there are not enough data to support them, or the data are too diverse), while others might collapse into each other (e.g., two apparently separate themes might form one theme). Other themes might need to be broken down into separate themes.

Patton's (1990) dual criteria for judging categories - internal homogeneity and external heterogeneity - are worth considering here. Data within themes should cohere together meaningfully, while there should be clear and identifiable distinctions between themes.

This phase involves two levels of reviewing and refining your themes:

### Level One
This involves reviewing at the level of the coded data extracts. You need to read all the collated extracts for each theme and consider whether they appear to form a coherent pattern. If your candidate themes do appear to form a coherent pattern, you then move on to the second level. If your candidate themes do not fit, you will need to consider whether the theme itself is problematic, or whether some of the data extracts within it simply do not fit there - in which case, you would rework your theme, creating a new theme, finding a home for those extracts that do not currently work in an already-existing theme, or discarding them from the analysis.

Once you are satisfied that your candidate themes adequately capture the contours of the coded data - once you have a candidate 'thematic map' - you are ready to move on to level two of this phase.

### Level Two
This involves a similar process, but in relation to the entire data set. At this level, you consider:
- The validity of individual themes in relation to the data set
- Whether your candidate thematic map 'accurately' reflects the meanings evident in the data set as a whole

You re-read your entire data set for two purposes:
1. To ascertain whether the themes 'work' in relation to the data set
2. To code any additional data within themes that has been missed in earlier coding stages

The need for re-coding from the data set is to be expected as coding is an ongoing organic process.

If the thematic map works, then you move on to the next phase. However, if the map does not fit the data set, you need to return to further reviewing and refining of your coding until you have devised a satisfactory thematic map. While you might identify potential new themes during this process, it's important not to get over-enthusiastic with endless re-coding. When your refinements are not adding anything substantial, stop! Consider it similar to editing written work - after a few editing turns, further work is usually unnecessary refinement.

At the end of this phase, you should have a fairly good idea of what your different themes are, how they fit together, and the overall story they tell about the data.

## Phase 5: Defining and Naming Themes

Phase 5 begins when you have a satisfactory thematic map of your data. At this point, you define and further refine the themes you will present for your analysis, and analyse the data within them. By 'define and refine', we mean identifying the 'essence' of what each theme is about (as well as the themes overall), and determining what aspect of the data each theme captures.

It is important not to try and get a theme to do too much, or to be too diverse and complex. You do this by going back to collated data extracts for each theme, and organizing them into a coherent and internally consistent account, with accompanying narrative. It is vital that you do not just paraphrase the content of the data extracts presented, but identify what is of interest about them and why.

For each individual theme, you need to conduct and write a detailed analysis. Consider:
- The 'story' that each theme tells
- How it fits into the broader overall 'story' about your data
- The relationship to research

Here's the cleaned and normalized Markdown:

## Phase 6: Producing the Report

Phase 6 begins when you have a set of fully worked-out themes, and involves the final analysis and write-up of the report. The task of the write-up of a thematic analysis, whether it is for publication or for a research assignment or dissertation, is to tell the complicated story of your data in a way which convinces the reader of the merit and validity of your analysis. It is important that the analysis (the write-up of it, including data extracts) provides a concise, coherent, logical, non-repetitive and interesting account of the story the data tell within and across themes. Your write-up must provide sufficient evidence of the themes within the data - i.e., enough data extracts to demonstrate the prevalence of the theme.

Choose particularly vivid examples, or extracts which capture the essence of the point you are demonstrating, without unnecessary complexity. The extract should be easily identifiable as an example of the issue. However, your write-up needs to do more than just provide data. Extracts need to be embedded within an analytic narrative that compellingly illustrates the story you are telling about your data, and your analytic narrative needs to go beyond description of the data, and make an argument in relation to your research question.

## Pinning Down What Interpretative Analysis Actually Entails

It is difficult to specify exactly what interpretative analysis actually entails, particularly as the specifics of it will vary from study to study. As a first step, we recommend looking at published examples of thematic analysis, particularly of the specific version you are planning to use (this is made somewhat more difficult in that thematic analysis is often not a named method, but you can find examples, e.g., Ellis and Kitzinger, 2002; Kitzinger and Willmott, 2002; Toerien and Wilkinson, 2004).

Frith and Gleeson (2004) aim to explore how men's feelings about their bodies influence their clothing practices, and they use data gathered in qualitative questionnaires from 75 men to answer this question. They report four themes:

- Practicality of clothing choices
- Lack of concern about appearance
- Use of clothing to conceal or reveal the body
- Use of clothing to fit cultural ideals

Each theme is clearly linked back to the overall research question, but each is distinct. They provide a clear sense of the scope and diversity of each theme, using a combination of analyst narrative and illustrative data extracts. Where relevant, they broaden their analysis out, moving from a descriptive to an interpretative level (often relating their claims to existing literature).

## Potential Pitfalls to Avoid When Doing Thematic Analysis

Thematic analysis is a relatively straightforward form of qualitative analysis, which does not require the same detailed theoretical and technical knowledge that approaches such as DA or CA do. However, there are several potential pitfalls to avoid:

1. Failure to actually analyse the data - Thematic analysis is not just a collection of extracts strung together with little or no analytic narrative.

2. Using data collection questions as themes - No analytic work has been carried out to identify themes across the entire data set.

3. Weak or unconvincing analysis - Where themes don't appear to work, there is too much overlap between themes, or themes are not internally coherent and consistent.

All aspects of the theme should cohere around a central idea or concept. This pitfall has occurred if the analysis fails to adequately capture the majority of the data, or fails to provide a rich description/interpretation of one or more aspects of the data.

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

A convincing analysis can also stem from a failure to provide adequate examples from the data - for example, only one or two extracts for a theme. This point is essentially about the rhetorics of presentation, and the need for the analysis to be convincing to someone who has not read the entire data set: 'The "analysis" of the material... is a deliberate and self-consciously artful creation by the researcher, and must be constructed to persuade the reader of the plausibility of an argument' (Foster and Parker, 1995: 204). In so doing, one avoids (the appearance of) what Bryman (1988) has referred to as 'anecdotalism' in qualitative research - where one or a few instances of a phenomenon are reified into a pattern or theme, when it or they are actually idiosyncratic. This is not to say that a few instances cannot be of interest, or revealing; but it is important not to misrepresent them as an overarching theme.

The fourth pitfall is a mismatch between the data and the analytic claims that are made about it. In such an (unfounded) analysis, the claims cannot be supported by the data, or, in the worst case, the data extracts presented suggest another analysis or even contradict the claims. The researcher needs to make sure that their interpretations and analytic points are consistent with the data extracts. A weak analysis does not appear to consider other obvious alternative readings of the data, or fails to consider variation (and even contradiction) in the account that is produced. A pattern in data is rarely, if ever, going to be 100% complete and non-contradicted, so an analysis which suggests that it is, without a thorough explanation, is open to suspicion. It is important to pick compelling examples to demonstrate the themes, so give this considerable thought.

The fifth involves a mismatch between theory and analytic claims, or between the research questions and the form of thematic analysis used. A good thematic analysis needs to make sure that the interpretations of the data are consistent with the theoretical framework. So, for instance, if you are working within an experiential framework, you would typically not make claims about the social construction of the research topic, and if you were doing constructionist thematic analysis, you would not treat people's talk of experience as a transparent window on their world. Finally, even a good and interesting analysis which fails to spell out its theoretical assumptions, or clarify how it was undertaken, and for what purpose, is lacking crucial information (Holloway and Todres, 2003), and thus fails in one aspect.

## What makes good thematic analysis?

One of the criticisms of qualitative research from those outside the field is the perception that 'anything goes'. For instance, this sentiment is echoed in the first sentence of Laubschagne's (2003) abstract: 'For many scientists used to doing quantitative studies the whole concept of qualitative research is unclear, almost foreign, or "airy fairy" - not "real" research.' However, although 'qualitative' research cannot be subjected to the same criteria as 'quantitative' approaches, it does provide methods of analysis that should be applied rigorously to the data. Furthermore, criteria for conducting good qualitative research - both data collection and analysis - do exist (eg, Elliott et al., 1999; Parker, 2004; Seale, 1999; Silverman, 2000; Yardley, 2000). The British Psychological Society offers relatively succinct online guidelines for assessing quality in qualitative research (see http://www.bps.org.uk/publications/journals/joop/qualitative-guidelines.cfm).

'Criteria' for assessing qualitative research is a not uncontroversial topic, with concerns raised about rigid criteria limiting freedom and stifling methodological development (Elliott et al., 1999; Parker, 2004; Reicher, 2000). Reicher (2000) takes the critique further, by asking whether the incredibly diverse range of qualitative approaches can an

## Disadvantages and Limitations

The flexibility of the method, which allows for a wide range of analytic options, means that the potential range of things that can be said about your data is broad. While this is an advantage, it can also be a disadvantage in that it makes developing specific guidelines for higher-phase analysis difficult, and can be potentially paralysing to the researcher trying to decide what aspects of their data to focus on. Another issue to consider is that a thematic analysis has limited interpretative power beyond mere description if it is not used within an existing theoretical framework that anchors the analytic claims that are made.

Other disadvantages appear when thematic analysis is considered in relation to some of the other qualitative analytic methods. For instance, unlike narrative or other biographical approaches, you are unable to retain a sense of continuity and contradiction through any one individual account, and these contradictions and consistencies across individual accounts may be revealing. In contrast to methods similar to DA and CA, a simple thematic analysis does not allow the researcher to make claims about language use, or the fine-grained functionality of talk.

Finally, it is worth noting that thematic analysis currently has no particular kudos as an analytic method - this, we argue, stems from the very fact that it is poorly demarcated and claimed, yet widely used. This means that thematic analysis is frequently, or appears to be, what is simply carried out by someone without the knowledge or skills to perform a supposedly more sophisticated - certainly more kudos-bearing - 'branded' form of analysis like grounded theory, IPA or DA. We hope this paper will change this view as, we argue, a rigorous thematic approach can produce an insightful analysis that answers particular research questions. What is important is choosing a method that is appropriate to your research question, rather than falling victim to 'methodolatry', where you are committed to method rather than topic/content or research questions (Holloway and Todres, 2003). Indeed, your method of analysis should be driven by both your research question and your broader theoretical assumptions. As we have demonstrated, thematic analysis is a flexible approach that can be used across a range of epistemologies and research questions.

## Notes

1. Boyatzis (1998) provides a much more detailed account of thematic analysis. However, we do not feel that it is a particularly accessible account for those unfamiliar with qualitative approaches. Moreover, his approach differs from ours in that, although he acknowledges the subjective dimension of qualitative analysis, his approach is ultimately, if often implicitly, located within a positivist empiricist paradigm.

2. Dey's (1993) account of on 'qualitative data analysis', which aims to identify shared techniques across the diverse range of qualitative methods, and demonstrate how to do 'qualitative analysis', reinforces this point in that his focus is largely thematic - but not claimed as such.

3. Some authors, such as Potter (1997: 147-48) argue that one should not simply provide 'recipes' for qualitative methods, such as DA, because 'a large part of doing discourse analysis is a craft skill, more like bike riding or sexing a chicken than following the recipe for a mild chicken rogan josh... This makes it hard to describe and learn'. While we do not disagree that the skills needed for qualitative analyses of all types need to be learned, others, such as McLeod (2001), argue that by not discussing the 'how to' of analysis, we keep certain methods mysterious (and thus elitist). Instead, if we want to make methods democratic and accessible - and indeed, to make qualitative research of all forms more understandable to those not trained in the methods, and arguably thus more popular - we need to provide concrete advice on how to actually do it. We are not questioning the importance of 'non-recipe' forms of training, but while 'recipes' necessarily diminish the complexity of certain methods, they are important for making methods accessible.

4. Foster and Parker (1995) suggest one way to acknowledge the creative and active role of the analyst is to use
