# The Role of Goal Orientation in Self-Regulated Learning

Paul R. Pintrich  
The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan

Self-regulated learning concerns the application of general models of regulation and self-regulation to issues of learning, in particular, academic learning that takes places in school or classroom contexts. There are a number of different models of self-regulated learning that propose different constructs and different conceptualizations (e.g., Boekaerts & Niemivirta, 2000, this volume; Butler & Winne, 1995; Corno, 1993; Pintrich & De Greet, 1990; Pintrich, Welters, & Baxter, in press; Pressley, 1986; Schunk, 1994; Schunk & Zimmerman 1994; Winne, 1995; Zimmerman, 1986; 1989; 1990; 1998a, 1998b, 2000, this volume), but all of these models share some general assumptions and features. One purpose of this chapter is to discuss some of the common features of these models to provide a synthetic overview and general framework for theory and research in self-regulated learning.

At the same time, a number of different motivational constructs have been linked to the processes of self-regulation (Pintrich, Marx, & Boyle, 1993; Pintrich & Schrauben, 1992) and there is a need for models of self-regulated learning that include both motivational and cognitive processes. Accordingly, a second purpose of this chapter involves a discussion of how motivational constructs, specifically goal orientation, may be related to processes of self-regulated learning. To accomplish these two general goals, a general framework for self-regulated learning is discussed first, followed by a summary of different goal orientations and how they may be linked to the different components of self-regulated learning. As part of this discussion of goal orientations, a taxonomy of goal orientations is presented to help organize the research. Given the nature of this handbook and space constraints for all the chapters, these two sections are not intended to be comprehensive reviews of all the extant research on self-regulated learning and goal orientation, but rather an integrative review with citations to illustrative research. This chapter concludes with some suggestions for future theory and research.

## A General Framework for Self-Regulated Learning

There are many different models of self-regulated learning that propose different constructs and mechanisms, but they do share some basic assumptions about learning and regulation. One common assumption might be called the active, constructive assumption, which follows from a general cognitive perspective. That is, all the models view learners as active, constructive participants in the learning process. Learners are assumed to actively construct their own meanings, goals, and strategies from the information available in the external environment as well as information in their own minds (the internal environment). Learners are not just passive recipients of information from teachers, parents, or other adults, but rather active, constructive meaning makers as they go about learning.

A second, but related, assumption is the potential for control assumption. All the models assume that learners can potentially monitor, control, and regulate certain aspects of their own cognition, motivation, and behavior as well as some features of their environments. This assumption does not mean that individuals will or can monitor and control their cognition, motivation, or behavior at all times or in all contexts; rather, just that some monitoring, control, and regulation is possible. All of the models recognize that there are biological, developmental, contextual, and individual difference constraints that can impede or interfere with individual efforts at regulation.

A third general assumption that is made in these models of self-regulated learning, as in all general models of regulation stretching back to Miller, Galanter, & Pribram (1960), is the goal, criterion, or standard assumption. All models of regulation assume that there is some type of criterion or standard (also called goals or reference value) against which comparisons are made in order to assess whether the process should continue as is or if some type of change is necessary. The commonsense

## The Role of Goal Orientation in Self-Regulated Learning

A general example for learning assumes that individuals can set standards or goals to strive for in their learning, monitor their progress toward these goals, and then adapt and regulate their cognition, motivation, and behavior to reach their goals.

A fourth general assumption of most of the models of self-regulated learning is that self-regulatory activities are mediators between personal and contextual characteristics and actual achievement or performance. That is, it is not just individuals' cultural, demographic, or personality characteristics that influence achievement and learning directly, or just the contextual characteristics of the classroom environment that shape achievement, but the individuals' self-regulation of their cognition, motivation, and behavior that mediate the relationships between the person, context, and eventual achievement. Most models of self-regulation assume that self-regulatory activities are directly linked to outcomes such as achievement and performance, although much of the research examines self-regulatory activities as outcomes in their own right.

Given these assumptions, a general working definition of self-regulated learning is that it is an active, constructive process whereby learners set goals for their learning and then attempt to monitor, regulate, and control their cognition, motivation, and behavior, guided and constrained by their goals and the contextual features in the environment. These self-regulatory activities can mediate the relationships between individuals and the context, and their overall achievement. This definition is similar to other models of self-regulated learning (e.g., Butler & Winne, 1995; Zimmerman, 1989, 1998a, 1998b, 2000).

Table 1 displays a framework for classifying the different phases and areas for regulation. The four phases that make up the rows of the table are processes that many models of regulation and self-regulation share (e.g., Zimmerman, 1998a, 1998b, 2000) and they reflect goal-setting, monitoring, and control and regulation processes. Of course, not all academic learning follows these phases, because there are many occasions for students to learn academic material in more tacit or implicit or unintentional ways without self-regulating their learning in such an explicit manner as suggested in the model. These phases are suggested as a heuristic to organize our thinking and research on self-regulated learning.

The four phases do represent a general time-ordered sequence that individuals would go through as they perform a task, but there is no strong assumption that the phases are hierarchically or linearly structured such that earlier phases always must occur before later phases. In most models of self-regulated learning, monitoring, control, and reaction can be ongoing simultaneously and dynamically as the individual progresses through the task, with the goals and plans being changed or updated based on the feedback from the monitoring, control, and reaction processes. In fact, Pintrich et al. (in press) suggest that much of the empirical work on monitoring (phase 2) and control/regulation (phase 3) does not find much separation of these processes in terms of people's experiences as revealed by data from self-report questionnaires or think-aloud protocols.

The four columns in Table 1 represent different areas for regulation that an individual learner (the personal self) can attempt to monitor, control, and regulate. The first three columns of cognition, motivation/affect, and behavior reflect the traditional tripartite division of different areas of psychological functioning (Snow, Corno, & Jackson, 1996). As Snow et al. (1996) noted, the boundaries between these areas may be fuzzy, but there is utility in discussing them separately, particularly because much of traditional psychological research has focused on the different areas in isolation from the others.

The cognitive column in Table 1 concerns the different cognitive strategies individuals may use to learn and perform a task as well as the metacognitive strategies individuals may use to control and regulate their cognition. In addition, both content knowledge and strategic knowledge are included in this area.

## Domain-Specific Models and Research on Self-Regulation

## Overview of Regulatory Areas

The cognitive column includes various cognitive strategies and tactics. The motivation and affect column concerns motivational beliefs about oneself in relation to tasks, including self-efficacy beliefs, task values, interest, and affective reactions. It also includes strategies to control and regulate motivation and affect. The behavior column reflects effort, persistence, help seeking, and choice behaviors.

The context column represents aspects of the task environment or classroom/cultural context. While some models don't consider context control as self-regulation (since it's external), this model includes individual attempts to monitor and control the environment as an important aspect of self-regulated learning. The key is that the self actively monitors and attempts to regulate the context, not just adapt to it.

## Regulation of Cognition

The four general phases of self-regulation can be applied to various aspects of cognition. While discussed separately for clarity, these phases may overlap or occur simultaneously with multiple interactions among processes and components. This is not assumed to be a simple linear process with separate non-interacting components.

### Cognitive Planning and Activation

There are three general types of planning/activation:

1. Target goal setting
- Setting task-specific goals to guide cognition and monitoring
- Goals can be adjusted during task performance based on monitoring and reflection
- Goals may address learning, time use, and performance

2. Activation of relevant prior knowledge
- Can happen automatically without conscious control
- Self-regulating learners actively search memory for relevant knowledge
- Includes content and metacognitive knowledge
- Can be done through prompts and self-questioning

3. Activation of metacognitive knowledge
- Includes knowledge about cognitive tasks and strategies
- Appears useful for learning
- Involves knowledge about cognitive tasks and cognitive strategies

## Domain-Specific Models and Research on Self-Regulation

Metacognitive task knowledge includes knowledge about how task variations can influence cognition. For example, if there is more information provided in a question or a test, then it generally will be more easily solved than when there is little information provided. Most students come to understand this general idea and it becomes part of their metacognitive knowledge about task features. Other examples include knowing that some tasks, or the goals for the task, are more or less difficult, like trying to remember the gist of a story versus remembering the story verbatim (Flavell, 1979).

Knowledge of strategy variables includes all the knowledge individuals can acquire about various procedures and strategies for cognition, including memorizing, thinking, reasoning, problem solving, planning, studying, reading, writing, and so forth. This is the area that has seen the most research and is probably the most familiar category of metacognitive knowledge. Knowledge that rehearsal strategies can help in recalling a telephone number or that organizational and elaboration strategies can help in the memory and comprehension of text information are examples of strategy knowledge.

Metacognitive knowledge has been further broken down into declarative, procedural, and conditional metacognitive knowledge (Alexander et al., 1991; Paris, Lipson, & Wixson, 1983; Schraw & Moshman, 1995). Declarative knowledge of cognition is the knowledge of the what of cognition and includes knowledge of the different cognitive strategies, such as rehearsal or elaboration, that can be used for learning. Procedural knowledge includes knowing how to perform and use the various cognitive strategies. It may not be enough to know that there are elaboration strategies like summarizing and paraphrasing; it is important to know how to use these strategies effectively. Finally, conditional knowledge includes knowing when and why to use the various cognitive strategies. For example, elaboration strategies may be appropriate in some contexts for some types of tasks (learning from text); other strategies such as rehearsal may be more appropriate for different tasks or different goals (trying to remember a telephone number). This type of conditional knowledge is important for the flexible and adaptive use of various cognitive strategies.

### Cognitive Monitoring

Cognitive monitoring involves the awareness and monitoring of various aspects of cognition and is an important component of what is classically labeled metacognition (Baker 1979; Baker 1989; Brown, Bransford, Ferrara, & Campione, 1983; Flavell, 1979; Koriat & Goldsmith, 1996; Nelson, 1996; Pintrich et al., in press; Schraw & Dennison 1994; Schraw, Dunkle, Bendixen & Roedal, 1995; Schneider & Pressley, 1997). In contrast to metacognitive knowledge, which is more static and "statable" (individuals can tell if they know it or not), metacognitive judgments and monitoring are more dynamic and process oriented, and reflect metacognitive awareness and ongoing metacognitive activities individuals may engage in as they perform a task.

One type of metacognitive judgment or monitoring activity involves judgments of learning (JOLs) and comprehension monitoring (Nelson & Narens, 1990; Pintrich et al., in press). These judgments may manifest themselves in a number of activities, such as individuals becoming aware that they do not understand something they just read or heard, or becoming aware that they are reading too quickly or slowly given the text and their goals. Judgments of learning also would be made as students actively monitor their reading comprehension by asking themselves questions. Judgments of learning also could be made when students try to decide if they are ready to take a test on the material they just read and studied or in a memory experiment as they try to judge whether they have learned the target words (Nelson & Narens, 1990). Pressley & Afflerbach (1995) provided a detailed listing of monitoring activities that individuals can engage in while reading. In the classroom context, besides reading comprehension or memory

At least strongly related to metacognitive monitoring activities, although metacognitive control and monitoring are conceived as separate processes (Butler & Winne, 1995; Nelson & Narens, 1990; Pintrich et al., in press; Zimmerman, 1989, 1994). As in any model of regulation, it is assumed that attempts to control, regulate, and change cognition should be related to cognitive monitoring activities that provide information about the relative discrepancy between a goal and current progress toward that goal. For example, if a student is reading a textbook with the goal of understanding (not just finishing the reading assignment), then as the student monitors his or her comprehension, this monitoring process can provide the student with information about the need to change reading strategies.

One of the central aspects of the control and regulation of cognition is the actual selection and use of various cognitive strategies for memory, learning, reasoning, problem solving, and thinking. Numerous studies have shown that the selection of appropriate cognitive strategies can have a positive influence on learning and performance. These cognitive strategies range from the simple memory strategies very young children through adults use to help them remember (Schneider & Pressley, 1997) to sophisticated strategies that individuals have for reading (Pressley & Afflerbach, 1995), mathematics (Schoenfeld, 1992), writing (Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1987), problem solving, and reasoning (see Baron, 1994; Nisbett, 1993).

Although the use of various strategies is probably deemed more cognitive than metacognitive, the decision to use them is an aspect of metacognitive control and regulation as is the decision to stop using them or to switch from one strategy type to another.

In research on self-regulated learning, the various cognitive and learning strategies that individuals use to help them understand and learn the material would be placed in this cell. For example, many researchers have investigated the various rehearsal, elaboration, and organizational strategies that learners can use to control their cognition and learning (cf. Pintrich & De Groot, 1990; Pintrich, Smith, Garcia, & McKeachie, 1993; Pressley & Afflerbach, 1995; Schneider & Pressley, 1997; Weinstein & Mayer, 1986; Zimmerman & Martinez-Pons, 1986). These strategies include the use of imagery to help encode information on a memory task as well as imagery to help one visualize correct implementation of a strategy (e.g., visualization in sports activities as well as academic ones; cf. Zimmerman, 1998a). The use of mnemonics also would be included in this cell as well as various strategies like paraphrasing, summarizing, outlining, networking, constructing tree diagrams, and notetaking (see Weinstein & Mayer, 1986).

## Cognitive Reaction and Reflection

The processes of reaction and reflection involve learners' judgments and evaluations of their performance on the task as well as their attributions for performance. As Zimmerman (1998b) pointed out, good self-regulators do evaluate their performance in comparison to learners who avoid self-evaluations or are not aware of the importance of self-evaluation in terms of the goals set for the task. In addition, it appears that good self-regulators are more likely to make adaptive attributions for their performance (Zimmerman, 1998b). Adaptive attributions are generally seen as making attributions to low effort or poor strategy use, not lack of general ability (e.g., I did poorly because I'm stupid or dumb) in the face of failure (Weiner, 1986; Zimmerman & Kitsantas, 1997). These adaptive attributions have been linked to deeper cognitive processing and better learning and achievement (Pintrich & Schrauben, 1992) as well as a host of adaptive motivational beliefs and behaviors such as positive affect, positive

## The Role of Goal Orientation in Self-Regulated Learning

## Domain-Specific Models and Research on Self-Regulation

The model is established on the awareness of and control of cognition, but there is little on "metamotivation" (but see Boekaerts, 1995), which would include student awareness of and attempts to control motivation. Again, in the interests of parsimony, the term "metamotivation" will not be used, but the model does include motivational self-awareness and control. Finally, although goal orientation is listed in Table 1 in the cell for activation of motivation, it will not be discussed in the current section, because it is the central focus of the second half of this chapter.

## Motivational Planning and Activation

In terms of the phases in Table 1, planning and activation of motivation involve judgments of efficacy as well as the activation of various motivational beliefs about value and interest. In terms of self-efficacy judgments, Bandura (1997) and Schunk (1989, 1991, 1994) have shown that individuals' judgments of their capabilities to perform a task have consequences for affect, effort, persistence, performance, and learning. Of course, once a learner begins a task, self-efficacy judgments can be adjusted based on actual performance and feedback, as well as individual attempts to actively regulate or change one's efficacy judgments (Bandura, 1997).

In the cognitive research on memory, individuals can make determinations of the difficulty level of the task such as how hard it will be to remember or learn the material, which, in the Nelson and Narens (1990) framework is called ease of learning judgments (EOL). These EOL judgments draw on both metacognitive knowledge of the task and metacognitive knowledge of the self in terms of past performance on the task. In the classroom context, students could make these EOL judgments as the teacher introduces a lesson or assigns a worksheet, project, or paper. These EOL judgments are similar to self-efficacy judgments, although the emphasis is on the task rather than the self. In this sense, EOL judgments and self-efficacy judgments reflect the task difficulty perceptions and self-competence perceptions from expectancy-value models (e.g., Eccles, 1983).

Along with judgments of competence, learners also have perceptions of the value and interest the task or content area has for them. In expectancy-value models (Eccles, 1983; Wigfield, 1994; Wigfield & Eccles, 1992), task value beliefs include perceptions of the relevance, utility, and importance of the task. If students believe that the task is relevant or important for their future goals or generally useful for them (e.g., chemistry is important because I want to be a doctor; math is useful because I need it to be a good consumer), then they are more likely to be engaged in the task as well as choose to engage in the task in the future (Wigfield, 1994; Wigfield & Eccles, 1992). In terms of a model of self-regulated learning, it seems likely that these beliefs can be activated early on, either consciously or automatically and unconsciously, as the student approaches or is introduced to the task by teachers or others. In addition, in the current model of self-regulated learning, it is assumed that students can attempt to regulate or control these value beliefs (e.g., Wolters, 1998).

Beside value beliefs, learners also have perceptions of their personal interest in the task or in the content domain of the task (e.g., liking and positive affect toward math, history, and science). The research on personal interest suggests that it is a stable enduring characteristic of an individual, but that the level of interest can be activated and can vary according to situational and contextual features; this construct is labeled the psychological state of interest (Krapp, Hidi, & Renninger, 1992; Schiefele,

## Domain-Specific Models and Research on Self-Regulation

## Motivational Control and Regulation

Research on self-efficacy focuses on helping individuals become aware of their efficacy levels and self-doubts, then changing their efficacy judgments to be more realistic and adaptive (Bandura, 1997). Attributional retraining helps individuals recognize and change maladaptive attributional patterns (Foersterling, 1985; Peterson, Maier, & Seligman, 1993). Test anxiety research examines both environmental conditions and coping strategies that address emotionality and cognitive components of anxiety (Hill & Wigfield, 1984; Tryon, 1980; Zeidner, 1998). In all cases, monitoring motivation and affect is crucial for control and regulation.

### Motivational Control Strategies

Researchers including Kuhl (1984, 1985), Corno (1989, 1993), and Boekaerts (1993; Boekaerts & Niemivirta, 2000) have identified various motivation and emotion control strategies:

- Self-efficacy control through positive self-talk
- Increasing extrinsic motivation through self-rewards and contingencies (Wolters, 1998)
- Evoking extrinsic goals like good grades
- Enhancing intrinsic motivation by making tasks more interesting
- Maintaining mastery-oriented focus
- Increasing task value by making it more relevant
- Self-affirmation by decreasing task value to protect self-worth (Garcia & Pintrich, 1994)

### Emotion Control Strategies

Students can employ various strategies to control emotions:

- Self-talk to control negative affect and anxiety
- Using shame or guilt as motivators
- Defensive pessimism to harness anxiety for better performance
- Self-handicapping through decreased effort or procrastination to protect self-worth

## Motivational Reaction and Reflection

After task completion, students experience emotional reactions and make attributions for outcomes (Weiner, 1986). These attributions can lead to complex emotions like pride, anger, shame, and guilt (Weiner, 1986, 1995). Students can actively control their attributions to protect self-worth and motivation. While some attributional biases may be automatic (e.g., fundamental attribution error), others may be intentional strategies for self-worth protection (Fiske & Taylor, 1991; Pintrich & Schunk, 1996).

## Domain-Specific Models and Research on Self-Regulation

In fact, much of the attributional retraining literature is focused on helping individuals change their attributions or attributional style to have more adaptive cognitive, motivational, affective, and behavioral reactions to life events (Peterson et al., 1993; Foersterling, 1985). Finally, these reflections and reactions can lead to changes in the future levels of self-efficacy and expectancy for future success, as well as value and interest (Pintrich & Sehunk, 1996; Weiner, 1986, 1995). In this manner, these potential changes in efficacy, value, and interest from phase 4 flow back into phase 1 and become the entry level motivational beliefs that students bring with them to new tasks.

## Regulation of Behavior

Regulation of behavior is an aspect of self-regulation that involves individuals' attempts to control their own overt behavior. Some models of regulation would not include this as an aspect of self-regulation, because it does not explicitly involve attempts to control and regulate the personal self and would just label it behavioral control. In contrast, the framework in Table 1 follows the triadic model of social cognition (Bandura, 1986; Zimmerman, 1989), where behavior is an aspect of the person, albeit not the internal self that is represented by cognition, motivation, and affect. Nevertheless, individuals can observe their own behavior, monitor it, and attempt to control and regulate it, and, as such, these activities can be considered self-regulatory for the individual.

At the same time, as signaled by the brackets for the cell that represents the intersection of the row for phase 1--forethought, planning, and activation--and the column for behavior, this cell for time and effort planning really represents cognitions. In this sense, it could be placed in the cell that reflects the intersection of forethought and cognition. That is, there may not really be any behavioral planning that is not also cognitive. However, there are models of intentions and intentional planning (e.g., Gollwitzer, 1996) that do conceptualize behavioral intentions as an aspect of volitional and regulatory control. Accordingly, in terms of the structure of the taxonomy in Table 1, it seems reasonable to place students' attempts to intentionally plan their behavior in this cell and to discuss them as part of the column for behavioral regulation.

### Behavioral Forethought, Planning, and Activation

Models of intentions, intentional planning, and planned behavior (e.g., Ajzen, 1988, 1991; Gollwitzer, 1996) have shown that the formation of intentions is linked to subsequent behavior in a number of different domains. In the academic learning domain, time and effort planning or management would be the kinds of activities that could be placed in this cell in Table 1. Time management involves making schedules for studying and allocating time for different activities, which are classic aspects of most learning and study skills courses (see Hofer, Yu, & Pintrich, 1998; McKeachie, Pintrich, & Lin, 1985; Pintrich, McKeachie, & Lin, 1987; Simpson, Hynd, Nist, & Burrell, 1997).

Zimmerman and Martinez-Pons (1986) have shown that self-regulating learners and high achievers do engage in time management activities. In addition, Zimmerman (1998a) discussed how expert writers, musicians, and athletes also engage in time management activities, not just students. As part of time management, students also may make decisions and form intentions about how they will allocate their effort and the intensity of their work. For example, students might plan to study regularly 1 or 2 hours a night during the semester, but during midterms or finals intend to increase their effort and time spent studying.

### Behavioral Monitoring and Awareness

In phase 2, students can monitor their time management and effort levels, and attempt to adjust their effort to fit the task.

Here's the cleaned and normalized Markdown:

## Behavioral Control and Regulation

Strategies for actual behavioral control and regulation are many as attested to by the chapters in this volume that address issues of behavioral control of physical health, mental health, work behaviors, and social relationships with others, as well as behavioral control of activities for academic learning. As noted in the previous section, students may regulate the time and effort they expend studying two textbook chapters based on their monitoring of their behavior and the difficulty of the task. If the task is harder than they originally thought, they may increase their effort, depending on their goals, or they may decrease effort if the task is perceived as too difficult. Another aspect of behavioral control includes general persistence, which is also a classic measure used in achievement motivation studies as an indicator of motivation. Students may exhort themselves to persist through self-talk (keep trying, you'll get it) or they may give up if the task is too difficult, again depending on their goals and monitoring activities.

The motivational strategies mentioned earlier such as defensive pessimism and self-handicapping included attempts to control anxiety and self-worth, but also had direct implications for an increase in effort (defensive pessimism) or decrease in effort (self-handicapping). As such, these strategies are also relevant to behavioral control efforts. One aspect of self-handicapping is procrastination, which is certainly behavioral in nature in terms of putting off studying for an exam or writing a paper until the last minute. Of course, because effort and persistence are two of the most common indicators of motivation, most of the motivational strategies mentioned in the earlier section will have direct implications for the behaviors of effort and persistence.

Another behavioral strategy that can be very helpful for learning is help seeking. It appears that good students and good self-regulators know when, why, and from whom to seek help (Karabenick & Sharma, 1994; Nelson-Le Gall, 1981, 1985; Newman, 1991, 1994, 1998a, 1998b; Ryan & Pintrich, 1997). Help seeking is listed here as a behavioral strategy because it involves the person's own behavior, but it also involves contextual control because it necessarily involves the procurement of help from others in the environment and as such is also a social interaction (Ryan & Pintrich, 1997). Help seeking can be a dependent strategy for students who are seeking the correct answer without much work or who wish to complete the task quickly without much understanding or learning. In terms of this goal of learning and understanding, dependent help seeking would be a generally maladaptive strategy, in contrast to adaptive help seeking where the individual is focused on learning and is only seeking help to overcome a particularly difficult aspect of the task.

## Behavioral Reaction and Reflection

Reflection is a more cognitive process and so there may be no behavioral reflection per se, but just as with forethought, the cognitions an individual has about behavior can be classified in this cell. For example, reflections on actual behavior in terms of effort expended or time spent on task can be important aspects of self-regulated learning. Just as students can make judgments or reflect on their cognitive processing or motivation, they can make judgments about their behaviors. They may decide that procrastinating studying for an exam may not be the most adaptive behavior for academic achievement. In the future, they may decide to make a different choice in terms of their effort and time management.

Certainly, in terms of reaction, the main behavior is choice. Students cannot decide only to change their future time and effort management; they also may make choices about what classes to take in the future (at least for high school and college students) or, more generally, what general course of study they will follow. This kind of choice behavior results in the selection of different contexts and leads us into the last column in Table 1.

## Regulation of Context

As previously noted, Table 1 includes the individual's attempts to monitor, control, and regulate the context as an important aspect of self-regulated learning, because the focus is on the personal self or individual who is engaged in these activities. Given that it is the active, personal self who is attempting to monitor, control, an

## The Role of Goal Orientation in Self-Regulated Learning

## Domain-Specific Models and Research on Self-Regulation

Students can activate knowledge about general norms or perceive certain norms (talking is not allowed, working with others is cheating, the teacher always has the correct answer, students are not allowed much autonomy or control, etc.) that can influence their approach to the classroom and their general learning. Other aspects of the classroom climate, such as teacher warmth and enthusiasm as well as equity and fairness for all students (e.g., no bias on the basis of gender or ethnicity), can be important perceptions or beliefs that are activated when students come into a classroom (Pintrich & Schunk, 1996). Of course, these perceptions can be veridical and actually represent the classroom dynamics, but there is also the possibility that the students can misperceive the classroom context because they are activating stereotypes without reflecting on the actual nature of the classroom. For example, there may be occasions when females accurately perceive a male math teacher's bias against females in math, but there also can be cases where this is a more stereotypical perception that is not reflected in the teacher's behavior. In any case, these perceptions, veridical or not, offer opportunities for monitoring and regulation of the context.

### Contextual Monitoring

Just as students can and should monitor their cognition, motivation, and behavior, they also can and should monitor the task and contextual features of the classroom. In classrooms, just as in work and social situations, individuals are not free to do as they please; they are involved in a social system that provides various opportunities and constraints that shape and influence their behavior. If students are unaware of the opportunities and constraints that are operating, then they will be less likely to be able to function well in the classroom. Awareness and monitoring of the classroom rules, grading practices, task requirements, reward structures, and general teacher behavior are all important for students to do well in the classroom. For example, students need to be aware of the different grading practices and how different tasks will be evaluated and scored for grades. If they are not aware that format can count (e.g., good penmanship in early grades) or that original thinking is important in a report, not just summarizing material from books or encyclopedias, then they will be less likely to adjust their behavior to be in line with these requirements. In college classrooms, entering freshmen often have difficulty in their first courses because they are not monitoring or adjusting their perceptions of the course requirements to the levels expected by the faculty. Many college learning strategy or study skills courses attempt to help students become aware of these differences and adjust their strategy use and behavior accordingly (Hofer et al., 1998; Simpson et al., 1997).

### Contextual Control and Regulation

Of course, as with cognition, motivation, and behavior, contextual monitoring processes are intimately linked to efforts to control and regulate the tasks and context. In comparison to control and regulation of cognition, motivation, and behavior, control of the tasks or context may be more difficult because they are not always under direct control of the individual learner. However, even models of general intelligence (e.g., the contextual subtheory; see Sternberg, 1985) often include attempts to shape, adapt, or control the environment as one aspect of intelligent behavior. Models of volitional control usually include a term labeled environmental control, which refers to attempts to control or structure the environment in ways that will facilitate goals and task completion (Corno, 1989, 1993; Kuhl, 1984, 1985). In terms of self-regulated learning, most models include strategies to shape, control, or structure the learning environment as important strategies for self-regulation (Zimmerman, 1998a).

In the traditional classroom context, the teacher controls most of the aspects of the tasks and context and therefore, there may be little opportunity for students to engage in contextual control and regulation. However, students often may attempt to negotiate the task requirements downward (can we write 5 pages instead of 10?, can we

## Environment Control and Self-Regulated Learning

Environment control to make it more conducive for studying (removing distractions, having an organized and specific place for studying) can facilitate learning and seems to be an important part of self-regulated learning (Hofer et al., 1998; Zimmerman, 1998a). Zimmerman (1998a) also discusses how writers, athletes, and musicians attempt to exert contextual control over their environment by structuring it in ways that facilitate their learning and performance.

## Contextual Reaction and Reflection

In terms of contextual reaction and reflection, students can make general evaluations of the task or classroom environment. These evaluations can be made on the basis of general enjoyment and comfort, as well as more cognitive criteria regarding learning and achievement. In some of the more student-centered classrooms, there is time set aside for occasional reflection on what is working in the classroom and what is not working in terms of both student and teacher reactions (Brown, 1997). As with cognition and motivation, these evaluations can feed back into phase 1 components when the student approaches a new task.

In summary, the four phase by four area taxonomy for regulation in Table 1 represents a general framework for conceptualizing self-regulated learning in the academic domain. It provides a taxonomy of the different processes and components that can be involved in self-regulated learning. The format of the taxonomy also allows for the integration of much of the research on self-regulated learning that has spawned a diversity of terms and constructs, but organizes it in such a manner that the similarities and differences can be seen easily. As researchers traverse the different areas of self-regulated learning, the taxonomy allows them to locate their own efforts within this topography as well as to spy underexplored territories in need of further investigation and examination.

## Goal Orientation and Self-Regulated Learning

A key assumption of all models of regulation is that some goal, standard, criterion, or reference value exists that can serve as a gauge against which to assess the operation of the system and then guide regulatory processes. In self-regulated learning research, two general classes of goals have been discussed under various names such as target and purpose goals (e.g., Harackiewicz et al., 1998; Harackiewicz & Sansone, 1991) or task-specific goals and goal orientations (e.g., Garcia & Pintrich, 1994; Pintrich & Schunk, 1996; Wolters, Yu, & Pintrich, 1996; Zimmerman & Kitsantas, 1997).

The general distinction between these two classes of goals is that target and task-specific goals represent the specific outcome the individual is attempting to accomplish. In academic learning contexts, it would be represented by goals such as wanting to get 8 out of 10 correct on a quiz or trying to get an A on a midterm exam. These goals are specific to a task and are most similar to the goals discussed by Locke and Latham (1990) for workers in an organizational context such as wanting to make 10 more widgets an hour or to sell 5 more cars in the next week.

In contrast, purpose goals or goal orientations reflect the more general reasons an individual does a task and are related more to the research on achievement motivation (Elliot, 1997; Urdan, 1997): it is an individual's general orientation (or schema or theory) for approaching the task, doing the task, and evaluating their performance on the task (Ames, 1992; Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Pintrich, in press).

Moreover, a focus on broader purpose goals or goal orientations may offer more potential for generalizability, as well as specific implications for practice, in contrast to a focus on more specific target goals. Given that there are an infinite number of specific target goals that individuals can adopt, it is not clear how a focus on the specific goal contents will offer much direction for educational practice,

## Domain-Specific Models and Research on Self-Regulation

Setting specific proximal goals is generally positive for learning and performance (Pintrieh & Sehunk, 1996). In contrast, a focus on general goal orientations might offer some parsimonious, but powerful and useful, ways to characterize individuals' motivation and how their motivation is linked to their self-regulated learning. In turn, these generalizations should lead to some specific suggestions for the improvement of educational practice (e.g., Maehr & Midgley, 1996). Finally, there has been a fair amount of research on how goal orientations are linked to various self-regulatory processes in the academic learning and achievement motivation literatures. The remainder of this section discusses two general goal orientations that have been proposed in different models and how different approach and avoidance forms of these goals may be linked to the different self-regulatory processes that were outlined in Table 1.

### Models of Goal Orientation

There are a number of different models of goal orientation that have been advanced by different achievement motivation researchers (cf. Ames, 1992; Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Harackiewicz et al., 1998; Maehr & Midgley, 1991; Nicholls, 1984; Pintrich, 1989; Wolters et al., 1996). These models vary somewhat in their definition of goal orientation and the use of different labels for similar constructs. They also differ on the proposed number of goal orientations and the role of approach and avoidance forms of the different goals. Finally, they also differ in the degree to which an individual's goal orientations are more personal, based on somewhat stable individual differences, or the degree to which an individual's goal orientations are more situated or sensitive to the context and a function of the contextual features of the environment.

Most of the models assume that goal orientations are a function of both individual differences and contextual factors, but the relative emphasis along this continuum does vary between the different models. Much of this research also assumes that classrooms and other contexts (e.g., business or work settings and laboratory conditions in an experiment) can be characterized in terms of their goal orientations (see Ford, Smith, Weissbein, Gully, & Salas, 1998, for an application of goal orientation theory to a work setting), but for the purposes of this chapter the focus will be on individuals' personal goal orientation. All of these differences have made integration of the findings somewhat difficult across different research programs.

Most models propose two general goal orientations that concern the reasons or purposes individuals are pursuing when approaching and engaging in a task. In Dweck's model, the two goal orientations are labeled learning and performance goals (Dweck & Leggett, 1988), where learning goals reflect a focus on increasing competence and performance goals involve either the avoidance of negative judgments of competence or the attainment of positive judgments of competence.

Ames (1992) labels these orientations mastery and performance goals, where mastery goals orient learners to "developing new skills, trying to understand their work, improving their level of competence, or achieving a sense of mastery based on self-referenced standards" (p. 262). In contrast, performance goals orient learners to focus on their ability and self-worth, to determine their ability with reference to besting other students, surpassing others, and receiving public recognition for their superior performance (Ames, 1992).

Maehr and Midgley and their colleagues (e.g., Anderman & Midgley, 1997; Kaplan & Midgley, 1997; Maehr & Midgley, 1991, 1996; Middleton & Midgley, 1997; Midgley, et al., 1996; Midgley et al., 1998) mainly have used the terms task goals and performance goals in their research program, and these terms parallel the two main goals from

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

## The Role of Goal Orientation in Self-Regulated Learning

Individuals can be motivated to try to outperform others and to demonstrate their competence and superiority, which reflects an approach orientation to the general performance goal. In contrast, individuals also can be negatively motivated to try to avoid failure and to avoid looking dumb, stupid, or incompetent, which they label an avoidance orientation to the performance goal.

In the same vein, Midgley and her colleagues (Middleton & Midgley, 1997; Midgley et al., 1998) have separated out both approach and avoid ability goals, which parallels the work by Elliot and his colleagues on approach- and avoidance-performance goals. Other researchers (e.g., Wolters et al., 1996; Urdan, 1997) have examined what they have called relative ability goals, but this construct seems to reflect the same construct as the approach-performance goal of Elliot and his colleagues. Finally, Skaalvik and his colleagues (Skaalvik, 1997; Skaalvik, Valas, & Sletta, 1994) also have proposed two dimensions of performance or ego goals, a self-enhancing ego orientation, where the emphasis is on besting others and demonstrating superior ability, as in the approach-performance goal, and self-defeating ego orientation, where the goal is to avoid looking dumb or to avoid negative judgments, as in the avoidance-performance orientation.

The approach-performance orientation focused on besting others and superior performance relative to peers is similar to the performance and ego orientation in the models of Dweck, Ames, and Nicholls. In addition, although not formally separated as two distinct performance or ego goals in the models of Dweck and Nicholls, both of those models did include concerns of avoiding judgments of incompetence or feeling dumb or stupid in their conceptualizations of performance and ego orientations, similar to the avoidance-performance orientation of Elliot and Midgley or the self-defeating ego orientation of Skaalvik.

Research on goal orientation also has revealed a number of other goals that students might adopt in classroom settings. For example, Pintrich and his colleagues (Pintrich 1989; Pintrich & De Groot, 1990; Pintrich & Garcia, 1991; Pintrich, Roeser, & De Groot, 1994; Pintrich et al., 1993; Wolters et al., 1996), as well as others (e.g, Urdan, 1997), have discussed an extrinsic orientation to the classroom where the focus is on getting good grades or seeking approval or avoiding punishment from teachers or other adults. This extrinsic orientation is most similar to extrinsic motivation as discussed in self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985). Nicholls and his colleagues have found two other goals, beyond ego- and task-involved goals, which they labeled work avoidance and academic alienation (Nicholls, 1989; Nicholls, Cheung, Lauer, & Patashnick, 1989). Work avoidant goals concern feeling successful when work or tasks are easy, whereas academic alienation goals are defined in terms of feeling successful when the students feel they can fool around and not do their school work and get away with it. Meece, Blumenfeld, & Hoyle (1988) also discussed work avoidant goals in terms of a desire to complete school work without putting forth much effort, a goal of reducing effort. Urdan (1997; Urdan & Maehr, 1995) and Wentzel (1991a, 1991b) have discussed the role of social goals, where the focus is on seeking friendships or being socially responsible, and how these goals are linked to self-regulation and achievement.

Given all these different goals and orientations, which share some similar and some different features, future research

## Domain-Specific Models and Research on Self-Regulation

Recent social cognitive perspectives on approaching and avoiding a task (e.g., Covington & Roberts, 1994; Harackiewicz et al., 1998; Higgins, 1997) have influenced our understanding of self-regulation. In particular, recent social cognitive models of self-regulation such as Higgins (1997) explicitly use this distinction of approach-avoidance (or promotion-prevention focus in his terms) to discuss different self-regulatory processes. An approach or promotion focus leads individuals to move toward positive or desired end states and to try to promote their occurrence, whereas an avoidance or prevention focus leads individuals to move away from negative or undesired end states and to prevent them from occurring (Higgins, 1997). As such, there should be some important distinctions between approaching and avoiding certain goals with concomitant influences on self-regulated learning. For example, a promotion or approach orientation might be expected to have some generally positive relations with cognition, motivation, and behavior, whereas a prevention or avoidance orientation should be negatively related to these aspects of self-regulated learning.

The rows in Table 2 reflect two general goals that students might be striving for and represent the general goals of mastery and performance that have been proposed by every one of the different models discussed here. The cells included in parentheses in Table 2 give some of the different labels that have been proposed for the two main goal orientations in different models. All the models agree that mastery goals (learning, task, task involved) are represented by attempts to improve or promote competence, knowledge, skills, and learning, and that standards are self-set or self-referential with a focus on progress and understanding. In all the models discussed, mastery goals have been discussed and researched only in terms of an approach orientation, that is, that students were trying to approach or attain this goal, not avoid it. As such, most models have proposed only the first cell in the first row in Table 2, it is not clear if there is an avoidance-mastery goal theoretically, and there has been no explicit empirical research on an avoidance-mastery goal.

On the other hand, there may be occasions when students are focused on avoiding misunderstanding or avoiding not mastering the task. Some students who are more "perfectionistic" may use standards of not getting it wrong or doing it incorrectly relative to the task. These students would not be concerned about doing it wrong because of comparisons with others (an avoidance-performance goal), but rather in terms of their own high standards for themselves. Future empirical research will have to be done to determine if avoidance-mastery goals exist or if adopting avoidance-mastery goals leads to differential predictive relations with other motivational, cognitive, and affective outcomes (such as those outlined in Table 1) in comparison to avoidance-performance goals.

The second row in Table 2 reflects the general performance goal orientation that all the models propose, but the approach and avoidance columns allow for the separation of the goal of trying to outperform or best others using normative standards from the goal of avoiding looking stupid, dumb, or incompetent relative to others. This distinction was formally made in the work of Elliot, Midgley, Skaalvik, and their colleagues, and all the studies have shown that there are differential relations between other motivational and cognitive outcomes and an approach-performance goal and an avoidance-performance goal (Harackiewicz et al., 1998; Middleton & Midgley, 1997; Midgley et al., 1998; Skaalvik, 1997).

In Dweck's model, the performance orientation included both trying to gain positive judgments of the self as well as trying to avoid negative judgments (Dweck & Leggett, 1988). In Nicholls's model, ego-involved or ego orientation also included both feeling successful when doing better than others or avoiding looking incompetent (Nicholls, 1984;

## Mastery Goals and Cognitive Self-Regulation

In terms of the four phases of the model presented in Table 1, most of the research in the cognitive column has focused on phases 2 through 4. There has been less research on the linkages between mastery goals and activation of content knowledge or metacognitive knowledge. This is certainly an area for future research, because there has been little investigation of how goal orientations, once adopted, result in the activation of different kinds of knowledge. This is an area where there is a need for more experimental research on knowledge representation and how it can be influenced by different goals and, reciprocally, how knowledge representations and activation may influence the adoption of different goals.

In terms of phases 2 through 4 in the cognitive column in Table 1, the research suggests that students who adopt a mastery goal are more likely to report monitoring and attempting to control their cognition through the use of various learning and cognitive strategies. Much of this research is based on self-report data from correlational classroom studies, although Dweck and Leggett (1988) summarized data from experimental studies. The classroom studies typically assess students' goal orientations and then measure students' reported use of different strategies for learning either at the same time or longitudinally. Although there are some problems with the use of self-report instruments for measuring self-regulatory strategies (see Pintrich et al., in press), these instruments do display reasonable psychometric qualities. Moreover, the research results are overwhelmingly consistent in terms of mastery goals accounting for between 10% to 30% of the variance in the cognitive outcomes. Studies have been done with almost all age groups from elementary to college students and have assessed students' goals for school in general as well as in the content areas of English, math, science, and social studies.

The studies have found that students who endorse a mastery goal are more likely to report attempts to self-monitor their cognition and to seek ways to become aware of their understanding and learning (phase 2) such as checking for understanding and comprehension monitoring (e.g., Ames & Archer, 1988; Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Meece, et al., 1988; Meece & Holt, 1993; Middleton & Midgley, 1997; Nolen, 1988; Pintrich & De Groot, 1990; Pintrich & Garcia, 1991; Pintrich et al., 1994; Pintrich & Schrauben, 1992; Wolters et al., 1996). In addition, this research consistently has shown that students' use of various cognitive strategies (phase 3) is positively related to mastery goals. In particular, this research has shown that students reported use of deeper processing strategies, such as the use of elaboration strategies (i.e., paraphrasing, summarizing) and organizational strategies (networking, outlining), is positively correlated with the endorsement of mastery goals (Ames & Archer, 1988; Bouffard, Boisvert, Vezeau, & Larouche, 1995; Graham & Golen, 1991; Kaplan & Midgley, 1997; Meece et al., 1988; Pintrich & De Groot, 1990; Pintrich & Garcia, 1991; Pintrich et al., 1993, 1994; Wolters et al., 1996).

Finally, in some of this research, mastery goals have been negatively correlated with the use of less effective or surface processing strategies (i.e., rehearsal), especially in older students (Anderman & Young, 1994; Kaplan & Midgley, 1997; Pintrich & Garcia, 1991; Pintrich et al., 1993). In contrast to this research on the use of various self-regulatory and learning strategies, there has not been much research on how mastery goals are linked to the

## The Role of Goal Orientation in Self-Regulated Learning

## Domain-Specific Models and Research on Self-Regulation

The research shows that adopting a mastery goal has positive implications for self-efficacy, task value, interest, attributions, and affect. Dweck and Leggett (1988) summarized mainly laboratory research showing that students oriented to mastery and learning maintained positive and adaptive efficacy beliefs and perceptions of competence when facing difficult tasks. Other correlational classroom research has shown the same general pattern (e.g., Ames, 1992; Kaplan & Midgley, 1997; Middleton & Midgley, 1997; Pintrich & De Groot, 1990; Pintrich & Garcia, 1991; Pintrich et al., 1993; Thorkildsen & Nicholls, 1998; Wolters et al., 1996). Students focused on improving and learning would be more likely to interpret performance feedback in terms of their progress, supporting their efficacy beliefs.

Dweck and Leggett (1988) also showed that students who adopted a mastery goal were much more likely to make adaptive attributions for their performance. In fact, the search for factors predicting why some individuals made adaptive attributions for failure and did not show learned helplessness generated some of the original goal theory research. Although it seems theoretically useful to separate goal orientations (adopted at task start) from attributions (reactive cognitions after performance), the linkages between goals and attributions are strong. Research consistently shows that students who adopt a mastery goal orientation are more likely to:

- Believe effort will lead to success (positive effort-outcome covariation)
- Believe effort does not necessarily mean low ability
- Attribute failure to low effort or poor strategy selection

This represents an adaptive pattern of attributions for students facing difficult tasks or failure, as attributions to effort or strategy use will not necessarily lower future expectancies and affect will remain positive, following attributional literature findings (Weiner, 1986).

Regarding interest, task value, and mastery goals, empirical research shows strong positive relations. While mastery goals have sometimes been measured similarly to personal interest, it's important for future research to separate these constructs conceptually. Generally, students who adopt an approach-mastery goal report more personal interest or intrinsic enjoyment in tasks (e.g., Butler, 1987; Harackiewicz, et al., 1998; Meece et al., 1988) and higher task value ratings regarding utility and importance of schoolwork (e.g., Wolters et al., 1996).

Research on mastery goals and motivational strategies is less extensive than that on cognitive strategy use. Studies show little relation between mastery goals and self-handicapping, though self-handicapping relates positively to performance goals. Wolters (1998) found college students' mastery goal adoption positively related to regulating efficacy, interest, and value (regulation of intrinsic motivation), while negatively relating to extrinsic regulation strategies.

Mastery goals also show positive influence on affective reactions, with studies finding they associate with less anxiety and more pride and satisfaction (Ames, 1992; Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Jagacinski & Nicholls, 1984, 1987).

Most research has examined only approach-mastery goals, not avoidance-mastery goals. Research on avoidance-mastery goals is needed, though theory suggests they may lead to negative motivational beliefs and affect, including higher anxiety and lower interest and self-efficacy. While these predictions need testing, avoidance-mastery goals may not greatly interfere with cognition but may impact student motivation and affect.

## Mastery Goals and Behavioral and Contextual Regulation

Research on how individuals regulate their behavior or attempt to shape their environment in relation to goals has been limited. More research is needed on both approach- and avoidance-mastery goals in this area.

## The Role of Goal Orientation in Self-Regulated Learning

## Domain-Specific Models and Research on Self-Regulation

Avoidance-mastery goals are related to behavioral and contextual regulation. Studies have shown that approach-mastery goals are more positively related to college students' attempts to manage their time and effort (Pintrich, 1989; Pintrich & Garcia, 1991; Pintrich et al., 1993), an important aspect of behavioral self-regulation. Research on help seeking has shown consistently that adopting a personal mastery goal is positively associated with adaptive help seeking (Newman, 1994, 1998a, 1998b; Ryan & Pintrich, 1997, 1998). Students who approach a task with a mastery orientation focused on learning would not see help seeking as a negative reflection on their ability (e.g., showing others that they are unable). They would be more likely to see help seeking as a strategy to help them learn (Newman, 1994, 1998a). Classroom research also shows that contexts that foster a mastery orientation in the classroom climate and structure lead to more adaptive help seeking (Newman, 1998b; Ryan, Gheen, & Midgley, 1998). In contrast, avoidance-mastery goals may lead to less adaptive help seeking and more dependent help seeking, because the student is only concerned with not being incorrect, not with actual mastery.

In summary, approach-mastery goals are generally related to positive outcomes, including the use of more self-regulatory strategies for cognition, positive motivational beliefs and strategies, and behavior. There is a need for research on how mastery goals are linked to the activation of knowledge about cognition as well as self-knowledge and the clarification of the causal relations between goals and other motivational constructs (i.e., interest). It seems likely that these relations are reciprocal, with mastery goals leading to interest and interest leading to mastery goals, but further specification of the dynamics of these reciprocal processes would be helpful for both theory and practice. For example, in terms of practice, goal theorists would concentrate on making classrooms more mastery and learning focused by changing the structural characteristics of the classrooms (feedback, opportunities for social comparison, reward structures, etc.), whereas interest theorists would focus on making the tasks more personally interesting to students. Of course, these intervention strategies are not mutually exclusive, but the example does highlight how practice might vary, depending on the causal relations expected by the different theories. Finally, there is a need for more research on the meaning and operation of an avoidance-mastery goal and if there are differential and more negative relations with self-regulation outcomes in comparison to an approach-mastery goal.

## Performance Goals and Self-Regulated Learning

The research on performance goals and self-regulated learning is not as easily summarized as the results for mastery goals. The original goal theory research generally found negative relations between performance goals and various cognitive, motivational, and behavioral outcomes (Ames, 1992; Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Pintrich & Schunk, 1996), although it did not discriminate empirically between approach- and avoidance-performance goals. The more recent research that has made the distinction between approach- and avoidance-performance goals does show some differential relations between approaching a task focused on besting others and approaching a task focused on trying not to look stupid or incompetent. In particular, the general distinction between an approach and an avoidance orientation suggests that there could be some positive aspects of an approach-performance orientation. If students approach a task by trying to promote certain goals and strategies, this might lead them to be more involved in the task than students who are trying to avoid certain goals, which could lead to more withdrawal and less engagement in the task (Harackiewicz et al., 1998; Higgins, 1997).

### Performance Goals and Cognitive Regulation

Most of the research on performance goals that did not distinguish between approach and avoidance versions finds that performance goals are negatively related to students' use of deeper cognitive strategies (e.g

Here's the cleaned and normalized Markdown:

## Domain-Specific Models and Research on Self-Regulation

learning strategies. These two studies did not include separate measures of avoidance-performance goals. In contrast, Middleton and Midgley (1997), in a correlational study of junior high students, found no relation between either approach- or avoidance-performance goals and cognitive self-regulation. Some of the differences in the results of these studies stem from the use of different measures, classroom contexts, and participants, making it difficult to synthesize the results. Clearly, there is a need for more theoretical development in this area and empirical work that goes beyond correlational self-report survey studies to clarify these relations.

Nevertheless, it may be that approach-performance goals could lead to deeper strategy use and cognitive self-regulation, as suggested by Wolters et al. (1996), when students are confronted with overlearned classroom tasks that do not challenge them, interest them, or offer opportunities for much self-improvement. In this case, the focus on an external criterion of besting others or being the best in the class could lead the students to be more involved in these boring tasks and to try to use more self-regulatory cognitive strategies to accomplish this goal. On the other hand, it may be that approach-performance goals are not that strongly related to cognitive self-regulation in either a positive or negative way as suggested by the results of Kaplan and Midgley (1997) and Middleton and Midgley (1997).

Taken together, the conflicting results suggest that approach-performance goals do not have to be negatively related to cognitive self-regulatory activities in comparison to avoidance-performance goals. This conclusion suggests that there may be multiple pathways between approach- and avoidance-performance goals, cognitive strategy use and self-regulation, and eventual achievement. Future research should attempt to map out these multiple pathways and determine how approach- and avoidance-performance goals may differentially relate to cognitive self-regulation activities.

## Performance Goals and Motivational Regulation

One factor that adds to the complexity of the results in discussing approach- and avoidance-performance goals is that in Dweck's original model (Dweck & Leggett, 1988), the links between performance goals and other cognitive, motivational, and achievement outcomes were assumed to be moderated by efficacy beliefs. That is, if students had high perceptions of their competence to do the task, then performance goals should not be detrimental for cognition, motivation, and achievement, and these students should show the same basic pattern as mastery-oriented students. Performance goals were assumed to have negative effects only when efficacy was low. Students who believed they were unable and who were concerned with besting others or wanted to avoid looking incompetent did seem to show the maladaptive pattern of cognition, motivation, and behavior (Dweck & Leggett, 1988).

Other more correlational research that followed this work did not always explicitly test for the predicted interaction between performance goals and efficacy, or did not replicate the predicted moderator effect. For example, neither Kaplan and Midgley (1997) nor Miller, Behrens, Greene, & Newman (1993) found an interaction between approach-performance goals and efficacy on cognitive outcomes such as strategy use. Harackiewicz et al. (1998), using both experimental and correlational designs, did not find moderator or mediator effects of efficacy in relation to the effects of approach mastery or approach-performance goals on other outcomes such as actual performance or intrinsic motivation.

Correlational studies also have revealed a mixture of findings with regard to the linear relations between performance goals and efficacy. For example, Anderman and Midgley (1997) showed that approach-performance goals were positively related to perceptions of competence for sixth graders, but unrelated to perceptions of competence for fifth grades. Wolters et al. (1996) found that approach-performance goals were positively related to self-efficacy for junior high students, but Middleton and Midgley (1

## Domain-Specific Models and Research on Self-Regulation

## Performance Goals and Motivation

Research has shown that approach performance goals do not necessarily reduce interest, intrinsic motivation, or task involvement compared to mastery goals. Experimental studies with college students playing pinball games or solving puzzles found that approach-performance orientation increased intrinsic motivation and task involvement, particularly for students high in achievement motivation or in more competitive contexts. Both mastery and approach-performance goals can engage students, depending on personal characteristics and context. However, avoidance-performance goals generally have negative effects on intrinsic motivation and performance.

Correlational studies support positive relations between approach-performance goals and interest, intrinsic motivation, and task value, while showing negative relationships between avoidance-performance goals and these outcomes. Students oriented toward avoiding negative competence judgments show more test anxiety and performance concerns, aligning with original research on general performance orientation. In contrast, approach-performance goals are either uncorrelated with anxiety or show relatively low negative relations.

## Performance Goals and Behavioral/Contextual Regulation

While less research exists on behavioral and contextual regulation activities compared to cognition and motivation, studies show that students with approach-performance goals are more likely to use self-handicapping strategies like procrastination and low effort. Research on help-seeking indicates that students focused on outperforming others or avoiding incompetence are less likely to seek help. These public displays of behavior differ from covert cognitive strategies, explaining why performance-oriented students may avoid behaviors that could reflect poorly on their ability.

## Conclusions

The relationship between approach/avoidance-performance goals and achievement cannot be simply generalized like approach-mastery goals. Avoidance-performance orientation appears maladaptive for academic tasks, with students concerned about appearing incompetent showing maladaptive patterns of cognition, motivation, affect, and behavior.

Approach-performance goals can have positive cognitive and motivational effects, contrary to normative goal theory but consistent with approach-avoidance frameworks. While competitive students trying to outperform others may show adaptive cognitive strategies and increased interest, this orientation can increase anxiety and reduce help-seeking behaviors. These effects may be moderated by:

- Personal characteristics (need for achievement, efficacy level, actual achievement level)
- Situational features (classroom competition level, context)

Further research is needed on factors that moderate and mediate relations between approach-performance goals and achievement.

The framework presented attempts to categorize and link different self-regulatory processes and goal orientations for a comprehensive view of goal orientation in self-regulated learning. This suggests that goal orientations are not simply good or bad, but have varying relationships with cognitive, motivational, and behavioral outcomes.

## Domain-Specific Models and Research on Self-Regulation

We will be able to develop a more complex, sophisticated, but realistic view of goals and self-regulated learning.

For example, the research clearly suggests that approach-mastery goals are related to very adaptive patterns of cognition, motivation, and behavior. There is very little disagreement with this generalization in the literature. Whereas the cell involving avoidance-mastery goals is a new proposal, there is a clear need for research on the existence and operation of this form of a mastery goal and how it may be related to self-regulated learning. In contrast, the distinctions between approach- and avoidance-performance goals suggest that they can have both costs and benefits for students' self-regulated learning. It may be that adopting one kind of approach-performance goal may result in some benefit for cognition and motivation, but it also may come at the cost of increased anxiety or negative affect.

We need more carefully designed research that builds upon the existing research and attempts to tease out when these different performance goals are adaptive and when they are maladaptive for self-regulated learning. The research needs to move beyond simplistic good-bad distinctions and investigate when these goals are adaptive, for what kinds of cognitive, motivational, or behavioral mediators and outcomes, for whom (different types of individuals, ages, genders, ethnic groups, cultures), and where and under what contextual conditions (types of tasks, classrooms, schools, other settings). This will help us clarify our theories and models, but it also will help us develop better applications and interventions to improve schooling.

Besides this general suggestion for research and the specific areas mentioned in the preceding sections, there are a number of general themes that can serve as directions for future research on the role of goal orientation and self-regulated learning. These include the following:

1. Definition and measurement of goals and self-regulated learning processes. As pointed out throughout this chapter, the research has used different definitions of goals and self-regulatory processes, different measures (self-reports, interviews, etc.), and different types of methodologies (experimental, correlational, observational, qualitative). For the field to advance, there needs to be more systematic attention to all of these theoretical and methodological issues. There is a clear need for goal theorists to agree on general definitions and a taxonomy of goal orientations so that future research can build on the existing research without inventing new terms and labels (Pintrich, in press). In the same manner, research on self-regulated learning could prosper from a careful consideration of definitions and terms. Whereas these definitional issues are not just theoretical, but also depend on empirical relations, more research of a multitrait, multimethod (MTMM) nature, such as Howard-Rose and Winne (1993), would be helpful in clarifying the theoretical and methodological differences in this research area.

2. The role of personal characteristics and potential moderator relations. Most of the research discussed in this chapter has not explicitly examined the role of how different personal characteristics (e.g., personality, intelligence, etc.) or demographic factors (age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, etc.) may moderate the relations between self-regulation and goals (for an exception, see Harackiewicz et al., 1998). However, there may be important moderating differences in the relations and generalizations that depend on these personal characteristics. For example, Graham (1994) pointed out that African-American students often maintain high efficacy perceptions, even in the face of frequent academic failure. This lack of calibration between efficacy and performance may be detrimental from a self-regulatory perspective, because the students may not believe they need to change some of their self-regulatory and cognitive strategies for learning. However, the high efficacy beliefs can be adaptive in terms of helping the students maintain their general level of effort and persistence.

Beyond ethnicity, there may be other personal characteristics that might moderate the general findings on the relations between goals and self-regulated learning. Gender could play a role in moderating the relations, although many studies do not report gender differences in the overall levels of endorsement of mastery and performance goals (Pintrich & Schunk

## Domain-Specific Models and Research on Self-Regulation

Finally, personality characteristics such as general temperament or emotionality (see Snow et al., 1996) may create a context where the relations between goals and regulation are modulated or exacerbated. For example, an individual who is higher in emotionality in general and prone to higher levels of both positive and negative emotions may have to be more self-regulating in general and then different goals may make this emotional regulation task easier or harder.

### The role of multiple goals

Related to this issue of the moderating effects of different personal characteristics is the role of multiple goals and how to conceptualize them and trace their operation. This chapter, for rhetorical reasons mainly, has discussed the role of the different goal orientations separately. However, it seems possible that students can adopt multiple goals for academic tasks. The experimental research usually induces goals and students are assigned to different goal groups, a design that does not allow for testing interactions between different goals. The correlational studies usually assess two or three different goal orientations at the same time. Much of this research has focused on the main effects of the different goals using regression analyses, and even when interactions were explicitly examined (e.g., Wolters et al., 1996), the results were not substantial or systematic. In other studies (e.g., Meece & Holt, 1993), cluster analyses have been used to create different groups of students that show different goal profiles and some different patterns of self-regulation and performance. There is a need for more empirical work that explicitly examines the potential interactions among goals, but there also is a need for more theoretical work that conceptualizes how students represent and react to the multiple goals they may have for academic tasks (Pintrich, in press). There may be a hierarchy of goal orientations or more dynamic cognitive processes (see Shah and Kruglanski, 2000, this volume) that allow students to switch between different goal orientations within a task with concomitant changes in self-regulation and processing. This is an important direction for future research.

### The role of control, regulation, intentionality, and automaticity

All models of self-regulated learning assume that attempts to monitor and control one's own learning through various adaptive cognitive, motivational, or behavioral regulatory strategies are basically positive for learning and achievement. There is certainly a great deal of evidence to suggest that students who engage in these kinds of adaptive self-regulatory processes do better in school, learn more, and achieve at high levels. At the same time, there may be a limit to how far these regulatory models can take us in understanding academic learning. There are still a host of issues related to the role of automaticity in cognitive processing and learning, and how these automatic processes may support, constrain, or conflict with attempts to self-regulate learning. There just has not been that much theoretical or empirical work that has tried to integrate the research on automatic, implicit, and even unconscious processes with the research on self-regulated learning.

In addition, there are problems with the role of intentionality in our models of self-regulated learning and how to characterize what is considered intentional and adaptive self-regulation. For example, most models assume that students construct personal goals for their learning in the classroom and then they try to monitor and regulate their learning to accomplish these goals. However, what if the goals are maladaptive for learning in the classroom (e.g., avoiding work or effort), but the student is quite good at regulating toward these maladaptive goals? Is this still adaptive self-regulation because it is in the service of the student's own goals? In contrast, if students adopt goals given to them by others, such as teachers and parents, and then regulate toward those goals, this may not be considered self-regulation in some models, because the goals are not the students' own goals. Although most models of self-regulation would not consider students to be self-regulating if they use regulatory strategies by luck, accident, or under the direct instruction or control of the teacher, there are still developmental issues regarding when a strategy that is taught by others becomes "internalized" or adapted by the student to be considered the students' own

## The Role of Goal Orientation in Self-Regulated Learning

There is a clear need for research on how well our models of goal orientation and self-regulated learning transfer when applied in different cultures. It would seem that some of the processes should be very similar, but there may be important differences in the relations between goals and self-regulation. An understanding of these potential cultural differences would help us refine our models and improve our own research and practice on these important issues.

In conclusion, current research on goal orientation and self-regulated learning has suggested a general framework for examining learning and motivation in academic contexts. Moreover, there are some important generalizations that are emerging from this research. It seems clear that an approach-mastery goal orientation is generally adaptive for cognition, motivation, learning, and performance. The roles of the other goal orientations need to be explored more carefully in empirical research, but the general framework of mastery and performance goals seems to provide a useful way to conceptualize the academic achievement goals that students may adopt in classroom settings and their role in facilitating or constraining self-regulated learning. There is much theoretical and empirical work to be done, but the current models and frameworks are productive and should lead to research on classroom learning that is both theoretically grounded as well as pedagogically useful.
