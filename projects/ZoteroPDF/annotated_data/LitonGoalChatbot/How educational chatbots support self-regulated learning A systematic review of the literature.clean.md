# How educational chatbots support self-regulated learning? A systematic review of the literature

## Abstract

Engagement in self-regulated learning (SRL) may improve academic achievements and support development of lifelong learning skills. Despite its educational potential, many students find SRL challenging. Educational chatbots have a potential to scaffold or externally regulate SRL processes by interacting with students in an adaptive way. However, to our knowledge, researchers have yet to learn whether and how educational chatbots developed so far have (1) promoted learning processes pertaining to SRL and (2) improved student learning performance in different tasks. To contribute this new knowledge to the field, we conducted a systematic literature review of the studies on educational chatbots that can be linked to processes of SRL. In doing so, we followed the PRISMA guidelines. We collected and reviewed publications published between 2012 and 2023, and identified 27 publications for analysis. We found that educational chatbots so far have mainly supported learners to identify learning resources, enact appropriate learning strategies, and metacognitively monitor their studying. Limited guidance has been provided to students to set learning goals, create learning plans, reflect on their prior studying, and adapt to their future studying. Most of the chatbots in the reviewed corpus of studies appeared to promote productive SRL processes and boost learning performance of students across different domains, confirming the potential of this technology to support SRL. However, in some studies the chatbot interventions showed non-significant and mixed effects. In this paper, we also discuss the findings and provide recommendations for future research.

## Introduction

Self-regulated learning (SRL) is considered a complex set of recursive and goal-oriented learning processes (Panadero, 2017). Self-regulated learners set their learning goals and actively select, monitor and modify their learning strategies to accomplish these goals and succeed in different learning tasks (Zimmerman, 2013; Winne & Hadwin, 1998; Winne, 2022; Cleary et al., 2022). Self-regulated learners are thus in control over their learning processes and learning goals (Winne, 2018). As engagement in SRL processes has a potential to improve academic achievements and, more broadly, to support lifelong learning (Cleary & Chen, 2009; Klug et al., 2011; Recommendation, 2018; Theobald, 2021), it is critical for students to master their command of SRL and become productive learners in different domains of knowledge.

To advance understanding of SRL and identify the relationships among different learning processes involved, researchers have proposed several SRL theoretical frameworks, such as Winne and Hadwin (1998); Winne (2018); Zimmerman (2000); Pintrich (2000). Although differences among these theoretical models are noticeable, these models broadly agree that SRL is a cyclic process that involves a repertoire of learning goals and learning strategies (Panadero, 2017). For example, according to Zimmerman (2000), self-regulated learners selectively use specific processes to work on learning tasks, over three cyclical phases: forethought, performance and self-reflection. Winne and Hadwin (1998)'s theoretical model describes SRL as a dynamic set of skills where learning unfolds over five facets (conditions, operations, products, evaluations, and standards - COPES) and four phases (defining task requirements, setting goals and devising plans, enacting study tactics, and adapting future studying).

Even though researchers have made a substantial progress over the past several decades towards deeper understanding and more effective support for learning processes involved in SRL, development of SRL skills is still considered challenging for many students (Bjork et al., 2013). For example, students struggle to gather appropriate resources for a learning task (List & Du, 2021); set relevant, specific and attainable goals to guide their engagement with the task (McCardle et al., 2017); select appropriate learning strategies and effectively use them (

Education and Information Technologies recently published several literature reviews on the topic (Winkler & Söllner, 2018; Pérez et al., 2020; Smutny & Schreiberova, 2020). All these reviews have contributed significant knowledge to this field, providing valuable findings about the currently available educational chatbots across disciplines and the benefits of using chatbot technologies in education to, e.g., supplement teaching or recommend learning content to students. However, to our knowledge, researchers have yet to learn how educational chatbots developed so far have supported processes theorised in SRL. These new findings may add to the current educational research and practice given the documented benefits of SRL skills for academic performance and life-long learning. To contribute new research knowledge to the fields of educational technology and learning sciences, we conducted the present systematic review of the literature explicitly focusing on how educational chatbots have been used to support SRL processes and learning achievements. Our analysis was based on Winne and Hadwin (1998)'s theoretical framework that defined facets and phases of SRL. Our findings may inform future research related to development and implementation of educational chatbots that provide a more comprehensive SRL support to learners.

## Background

### SRL theoretical framework to guide this systematic review

Different theoretical frameworks have been proposed to date to define SRL processes and to understand the relationships among them, and, in this way, help researchers to measure and support learners' engagement in SRL. For an overview of major SRL theoretical frameworks, see Panadero (2017). To theoretically ground our systematic literature review, we utilized the SRL theoretical model proposed by Winne and Hadwin (1998). According to this framework, students' SRL processes unfold over four general phases: task definition, goal setting and planning, enacting study tactics, and adaptation to future studying, and five facets: conditions, operations, products, evaluations and standards. We opted to use this framework because:

1. It is one of the six most cited frameworks in the literature, signifying its robustness and widespread acceptance among researchers, and it is particularly welcomed in research involving computer assisted learning (Panadero et al., 2016)
2. It provides a comprehensive account of cognitive, metacognitive and motivational processes that interweave in SRL offering a holistic view of the learning process
3. The model is distinguished by its detailed depiction of how different phases interact with each other over time as learning unfolds, affording researchers and educators ways to design specific and time-sensitive SRL support to learners (Greene & Azevedo, 2007)

The first phase in Winne and Hadwin's model of SRL is task definition where learners make inferences and develop perceptions about the features of the task, and survey available resources for studying. The next phase is goal setting and planning where learners set their learning goals, devise plans and determine learning strategies which will be used to accomplish goals for learning. In the following phase, students enact their learning strategies and oversee (i.e., metacognitively monitor) the effectiveness of those strategies in addressing the task. For example, learners might highlight key concepts and construct a vocabulary list during a reading task, and, if they deem this strategy to be ineffective, they may decide to modify (i.e., metacognitively control) it, e.g., engage in note-taking instead of highlighting. In the adaptation phase, learners reflect on their studying during the previous stages and make forward-reaching adaptations for similar tasks in the future, e.g., a learner may decide to include note-taking in a repository of preferable learning strategies for the upcoming reading comprehension tasks, as note-taking worked well for the learner in the present task. In this way, learners reach beyond the present task and change their cognitive conditions for future learning (Greene & Azevedo, 2007).

Learning activities that unfold over the four general phases of SRL can be characterised relative to five common dimensions, i.e., facets: conditions, operations, products, evaluations and standards (COPES

## Educational Chatbots and Self-Regulated Learning: A Systematic Review

## Introduction

Educational chatbots may provide external regulation to learners by performing part of metacognitive monitoring instead of students having to conduct these processes by themselves (Molenaar, 2022). For example, a bot may identify two learning strategies that a learner had used previously and ask them to compare the effectiveness of these strategies relative to task requirements. In this way, a chatbot may help preserve cognitive resources for other aspects of the task, like constructing deeper understanding of concepts studied. By providing SRL guidance, chatbots may help learners increase their engagement across phases and facets of SRL, potentially benefiting their development of SRL skills and boosting academic achievements.

Recent literature reviews (Winkler & Söllner, 2018; Pérez et al., 2020; Smutny & Schreiberova, 2020; Wollny et al., 2021) have reported that chatbots have been used for two main purposes in educational settings:

1. Service support
2. Teaching support

Building on the success of chatbots in customer service, many educational institutions use them to provide service support to students, such as help with enrollment, library and campus resources (Sweidan et al., 2021; Allison, 2012). For example, the interactive bot SIAAA-C (Sweidan et al., 2021) provides students with important campus resources like campus maps and COVID-19 notifications.

Teaching-oriented chatbots commonly supplement traditional teaching in domains like languages, math and science. These chatbots typically play the role of human tutor, providing content knowledge and practice questions. For instance, Wu et al. (2020) developed a multi-module chatbot supporting mathematics and Chinese history studies, while Mageira et al. (2022) and Vázquez-Cano et al. (2021) created chatbots to help students learn English and Spanish through prompting and recommending additional learning resources.

While several studies have investigated using chatbots for SRL, there has been insufficient understanding about the extent to which different aspects of SRL have been supported. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic literature review to learn:

1. How educational chatbots have provided support for learners' SRL
2. How that support has affected learners' SRL skills and performance

## Research Questions

- RQ1: How have educational chatbots been used to support students' SRL processes relative to (i) phases and (ii) facets theorised in Winne and Hadwin (1998) and Winne (2018)?
- RQ2: To what extent has the use of educational chatbots improved learners' SRL processing and learning performance?

## Methodology

We conducted a systematic review using the PRISMA framework (Page et al., 2021; Moher et al., 2009) involving three major phases:

1. Search for relevant publications in multiple bibliographical databases
2. Select relevant publications following the PRISMA framework
3. Extract and analyse relevant information in selected publications to answer research questions

### Literature Search

We utilized the SPIDER framework (Cooke et al., 2012) to define search parameters:

- Sample: Students in formal educational settings at primary, secondary and tertiary levels
- Phenomena of Interest: Self-regulated learning and educational chatbots
- Design: Empirical evaluation of chatbot effects on SRL
- Evaluation: Reported outcome measures
- Research type: Qualitative, quantitative and mixed-methods studies

The search query used was: ("chatbot" OR "educational chatbot" OR "conversational agent") AND "self-regulated learning" AND "formal education" AND ("student" OR "learner") AND "research article"

We searched publications from 2012-2023 across multiple databases including Scopus, Elsevier, ACM, IEEE Xplore, Web of Science, ERIC, PsychInfo, Wiley library, Google Scholar, ResearchG

## Education and Information Technologies

In other words, publications selected in the abstract screening step were reviewed in full for their relevance at the full paper review step. For these two reviewing steps, we followed our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Specifically, we included research studies that:

1. Reported on the use of chatbots in formal educational settings
2. Reported on the use of chatbots to support students to engage in SRL processing (e.g., goal setting, strategy use, and monitoring)
3. Described characteristics of educational chatbots (e.g., chatbot architecture and types of utterances exchanged between student and bot)
4. Reported on the effectiveness of educational chatbots in supporting SRL skills and/or learning outcomes
5. Were published in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings in English between Jan 2012 and Oct 2023

We excluded:

1. Publications that reported on using chatbots outside of formal educational settings (e.g., school administration and customer service)
2. Publications from which it could not be clearly inferred what SRL processes have been supported by the chatbot (e.g., studies applying a third-party chatbot as a black box intervention or using a chatbot to conduct a quiz)
3. Publications that did not provide a clear description of chatbot characteristics
4. Publications that did not provide the evaluation of chatbot effectiveness
5. Technical reports, conceptual and design papers
6. Non-peer reviewed publications and publications without available full-text

At the screening step, two reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of 526 publications, i.e., those publications that remained from the previous phase in this review. Each reviewer had an opportunity to vote "Yes", "Maybe" or "No" for the study, relative to whether the study should be included in the next stage of the review. The reviewers had the agreement on 456 papers (86.7%, Fleiss kappa = 0.734, p<0.001). The remaining 70 conflicts were resolved through discussion between the reviewers. The main reasons for conflicts came from abstracts that did not explicitly state whether the chatbot evaluation was performed in the study. The reviewers agreed to keep such articles in the dataset and fully assess those in the next stage. A total of 101 publications remained in the dataset after this stage.

At the full paper review step, the reviewers randomly selected 15 out of 101 publications (nearly 15%), separately reviewed those and voted whether the paper should be included in the study or not, following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The reviewers agreed on 12 out of 15 publications (80%, Fleiss kappa = 0.52, p=0.04). The common disagreement between the reviewers at this stage was about whether the study provided a sufficiently clear description of the bot characteristics. This disagreement was resolved through discussion between the reviewers and the decision was made to include in the final review only those publications that described types of utterances exchanged between a student and a bot. The reviewers evenly split the remaining publications in the dataset (i.e., 86 publications were randomly assigned to each reviewer) and reviewed those separately. A total of 27 papers were extracted for the review. We summarized our review process in Fig. 1 (Page et al., 2021).

### Analysis of extracted publications

The first author of this review extracted data from each publication as per following categories: general information (publication title, authors, year, sample size, level of education, domain of education and learning task), chatbot type, SRL facet (conditions, operations, products, evaluations, and standards), SRL phase (task understanding, goal setting and planning, enactment, and adaptation), and reported effects (on SRL processes and learning achievements). To categorise publications into suitable SRL facets and phases, the first author closely followed definitions of constructs provided in Winne and Hadwin (1998). See the section SRL Theoretical Framework to Guide This Review for details.

## Results

## General Information

We summarised the studies included in our systematic literature review in Fig. 2. Out of the 526 studies that we assessed in this review, 27 studies fit the inclusion criteria for full review. Over 92% of these studies were published in 2020 onward, i.e., six in 2020, 11 in 2021, two studies in 2022 and six studies in 2023, whereas only two studies were published before 2020. We observed that 13 studies utilized a natural language processing (NLP)-driven approach in their chatbot design to interpret and respond to user inputs in a conversational manner. On the other hand, 13 studies employed rule-based architectures in their chatbot design, i.e., following predefined pathways or rules to respond to specific commands or keywords, offering predictable and consistent interactions within a structured framework (Fig. 2). Additional architectures in the reviewed studies include an NLP-driven architecture with contextual bandit algorithm (Cai et al., 2021) and knowledge-based system accessing a vast domain-specific database to deliver accurate information (Chang et al., 2022b).

Further, the chatbots we reviewed provided SRL support to students in different domains of education, including language learning, math, science, computer programming, accounting and educational psychology, with language learning being slightly more prominent than the other domains (Fig. 3). Moreover, the chatbots included in this review have been mainly utilised in higher education, i.e., researchers provided chatbots to university students in 21 studies. Two studies were conducted in primary schools, three studies were conducted in secondary school and one study involved a diverse student population recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (Fig. 3).

## RQ1: How have educational chatbots been used to support students' SRL processes relative to (1) phases and (2) facets theorised in Winne and Hadwin (1998) and Winne (2018)?

Of 27 articles included in this review, 15 reported on using chatbots to support student SRL processing in a single SRL phase, 11 articles reported on support across two and 1 article reported on support across three SRL phases. None of the reviewed studies appeared to utilise educational chatbots to provide comprehensive SRL support across all four phases of SRL defined in Winne and Hadwin (1998). More specifically, in 25 articles researchers used chatbots to facilitate SRL during the strategy enactment phase, i.e., the phase in which students are to select and use learning tactics and strategies. In these studies, chatbots were mainly utilised to guide students to enact learning tactics/strategies to accomplish a particular learning task, such as writing a thesis statement (Lin & Chang, 2020) or an essay (Neumann et al., 2021), learning a programming language (Ait et al., 2023; Tian et al., 2021) and developing a project report (Kumar, 2021). Six chatbots supported students at the task definition stage, e.g., "Make sure to re-read the question!" (Cai et al., 2021). Five chatbots supported students to set goals and devise plans for learning, e.g., by scaffolding students to specify their achievement goals (Hew et al., 2021, 2023) and by guiding goal setting with questions (Du et al., 2021; Al-Abdullatif et al., 2023). Four chatbots supported students to adapt to their future studying, e.g., by providing students with the opportunity to monitor their learning progress (Harati et al., 2021; Oliveira et al., 2021) (Fig. 4).

In all the studies we reviewed authors have reported on using chatbots to promote SRL processes at conditions, operations, and products, the three cognitive facets of SRL. For instance, researchers have used chatbots to

Students transform knowledge from readings into a written narrative (Bailey et al., 2021) and apply knowledge in a practical project (Kumar, 2021). 13 chatbots provided support for metacognitive operations of monitoring. These include guiding students to monitor for:
- Domain knowledge acquisition (Harati et al., 2021)
- Learning goals and responses to questions (Hew et al., 2021)
- Learning strategy employment (Song & Kim, 2021)
- Progress and performance (Cai et al., 2021; Neumann et al., 2021; Oliveira et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2023a,b)

Five chatbots provided support for searching operations. These include guiding students to search for:
- Course materials and learning content (Chang et al., 2022a,b; Oliveira et al., 2021)
- Specific learning strategies (Du et al., 2021)
- Learning tools (Jones & Castellano, 2018)

And one chatbot included support for a cognitive operation of rehearsing by guiding students to formulate acquired knowledge in their own words (Jeon, 2021).

The most common learning products that students created while studying with chatbots were answers to questions on tests/quizzes (Cai et al., 2021; Chang et al., 2022b; Jeon, 2021), and only a few chatbots have supported students to produce:
- Essays (Neumann et al., 2021)
- Thesis statements (Lin & Chang, 2020)
- Project reports (Kumar, 2021)
- Learning goals (Du et al., 2021)

Further, 16 chatbots in the corpus provided support for learning processes theorised to occur at the evaluations facet of SRL. For instance, chatbots utilized in Cai et al. (2021), Oliveira et al. (2021), Zhang et al. (2023a) and Lin and Chang (2020) assisted students to engage in judgment of learning, whereas chatbots in Jones and Castellano (2018), Hew et al. (2021), Song and Kim (2021) and Yin et al. (2021) promoted student engagement in self-reflection.

Last, 14 chatbots provided guidance to students to better comprehend task standards. Specifically, these chatbots provided students with:
- Initial explanations of task requirements and other task features (Bailey et al., 2021; Lin & Chang, 2020; Jones & Castellano, 2018; Chen et al., 2020)
- Task-related tips (Tian et al., 2021)
- Opportunities for progress check relative to task topics (Harati et al., 2021)
- Questions for goal setting (Du et al., 2021; Hew et al., 2023)

We provide the summary table of the SRL phases and facets supported by the educational chatbots included in this review in the appendix (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9).

### RQ2: To what extent the use of educational chatbots improved students' SRL processing and learning performance?

Among the publications reviewed, we found mixed effects of educational chatbots on students' SRL processes and learning performance. In terms of promoting SRL processing, researchers have reported that students who studied with chatbots tended to:
- Use more effective learning strategies (Bailey et al., 2021; Chang et al., 2022b; Mellado-Silva et al., 2020)
- Increase their awareness of the importance of setting learning goals (Du et al., 2021; Hew et al., 2023)
- Control the learning process over their study pace (Yin et al., 2021; Tian et al.,

## Educational Chatbots for Self-Regulated Learning: A Systematic Review

## Key Findings

Educational chatbots have been applied across diverse domains, aligning with previous literature reviews (Winkler & Söllner, 2018; Pérez et al., 2020; Smutny & Schreiberova, 2020). This cross-domain popularity may stem from the technology's inherent adaptability to different users and topics.

Educational chatbots for self-regulated learning (SRL) have primarily supported learners' processes at only one or two phases of the Winne and Hadwin model. Current implementations lack comprehensive SRL support addressing all four phases defined by Winne and Hadwin (1998) and Winne (2018).

Most reviewed chatbots were designed to promote specific learning tactics and strategies deemed important for task success. For example, in thesis statement writing tasks (Lin & Chang, 2020), chatbots guide students through activities like:
- Identifying relevant passages
- Identifying claims
- Composing thesis statements
- Evaluating conceptual understanding
- Revising thesis statements

## Support Mechanisms and Limitations

Chatbots primarily supported cognitive operations including:
- Rehearsing
- Assembling
- Translating

These operations typically depend on specific task conditions. The design of SRL chatbots appears primarily informed by the nature of specific learning tasks rather than comprehensive SRL support.

To a lesser extent, chatbots supported metacognitive evaluation through:
- Interactive and personalized feedback
- Judgment of learning opportunities
- Strategy evaluation and adaptation

## Internal Conditions and Future Possibilities

Student internal conditions (motivation, self-efficacy, interest) are typically measured through:
- Self-report questionnaires
- Interviews
- Self-reflection prompts

Current limitations include:
- Rare collection of dynamic data during learning sessions
- Limited capability to respond to evolving internal conditions
- Challenges in maintaining student motivation and engagement
- Difficulty in providing consistently accurate responses

The emergence of advanced generative language models like ChatGPT opens new possibilities for transforming educational chatbots from simple information acquisition tools to sophisticated pedagogical aids offering personalized learning experiences.

## Conclusion

While educational chatbots show promise in supporting SRL, particularly in strategy enactment and cognitive operations, significant gaps remain in providing comprehensive SRL support across all phases of the Winne and Hadwin model. Future development should focus on creating more holistic support systems that address the full SRL cycle.

## Education and Information Technologies

Based on the findings from this systematic literature review, we propose the following areas of investigation towards advancing research on chatbots and SRL.

1. Create chatbots that provide a comprehensive SRL support across all the phases
Our results suggest that, to date, there has been no chatbot designed to provide a comprehensive support across all the four phases of SRL defined in the Winne and Hadwin model. For instance, even though student engagement in goal settings, planning, and adaptation has been widely documented to benefit student learning experiences and performance (Alessandri et al., 2020; Raković et al., 2022a; Rakovic et al., 2022b), SRL processes at these stages have been rarely supported in the reviewed corpus, which may partially explain small, insignificant and limited effects of several chatbots on student achievements in this review. Within the SRL framework, each phase builds upon the previous one creating a cyclical process that allows students to continuously improve their learning strategies and accomplish their learning goals. Supporting studying in each phase of SRL may provide students with better control over their learning and may lead to greater academic success, increased confidence and motivation in one's ability to learn.

2. Identify specific learning tasks in which chatbots can provide most effective support
While it is important to apply chatbots in different subject domains, it is equally important to identify specific tasks within those domains where chatbots can be most effective. By doing so, researchers and educators can ensure that chatbots are used in a targeted and effective manner, maximizing the impact of this technology on students' learning experience. In this way, chatbots may help learners develop a catalogue of task-specific learning skills and transfer these skills to similar tasks in the future.

3. Evaluate the effectiveness of SRL chatbots in longitudinal studies
Most of the educational chatbots in this review have been evaluated in small scale studies, e.g., a one-time intervention administered in one class. Such a lack of longitudinal data might impede researchers from gaining a deeper understanding of the long term benefits of SRL chatbots. Therefore, it may benefit future research in educational technology and learning sciences if researchers conduct a longitudinal study, e.g., a study spanning over one or several semesters, to examine the effects of chatbot on the development of students' SRL skills over time.

4. Use chatbot to elicit students' internal conditions
Student internal conditions including prior knowledge, motivation, interest, self-efficacy, achievement goals, utility value and outcome expectations can have a significant impact on how learners approach and engage with the learning process (Meece, 2023). However, there are very limited existing efforts in learning analytics focusing on understanding and eliciting internal conditions (Matcha et al., 2019). These constructs have been typically measured at the beginning of a learning task. Since SRL is a dynamic and cyclic process (Panadero, 2017), student internal conditions may often change during the learning session, also affecting other processes that learners enact. For example, use of effective learning strategies and accomplishment of some learning goals early in a learning session may increase students' self-efficacy and motivation later in the session, compared to what learners reported at the outset of the session. Given the conversational and interactive nature of chatbots, researchers may consider using this technology as an instrument that dynamically captures changes in internal conditions and helps learners to reflect on their own learning process, e.g., by engaging in dialogues with learners, asking questions that gauge students' understanding, their learning goals and confidence levels, analyzing the content and frequency of student interactions, providing feedback on their progress, and offering suggestions for improvement.

5. Record and analyse what students did, not only what they say they did
Digital trace-data, e.g., navigation logs, text annotations and keystrokes, that students generate in digital learning environments have been increasingly harnessed to unobtrusively measure SRL (Fan et al., 2022; Rakovic et al., 2022b; Lim et al., 2023). For instance, trace-data are often mappe

Here's the cleaned Markdown:

Education and Information Technologies may utilize the rapidly emerging technologies of generative AI specifically large language models like ChatGPT, that can handle complex language problems to enhance the chatbots' ability to understand learners' intentions and provide appropriate responses in the context of SRL. In this way, the volume of productive interactions between students and SRL chatbots may improve student learning experiences and interest in studying with a bot, marking a step forward in AI-driven education.
