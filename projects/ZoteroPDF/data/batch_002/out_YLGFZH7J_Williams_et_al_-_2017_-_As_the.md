# As the climate changes: Intergenerational action-based learning in relation to flood education

# ABSTRACT

It is a concern that children represent an under-researched group in flood education and preparedness because as adults they are more likely to experience flooding as the climate changes, and because it suggests their potential today, as agents of change, is being undervalued. Using actionbased, participatory methodology with seven to nine-year-old children, a creative and inclusive flood education resource was developed as a stimulus for learning. Evaluation revealed that young children can learn about flooding and preparedness, and that intergenerational learning from child to parent can also occur, with children transferring the messages learned in school to home. However, thematic analysis suggests key factors such as family relationships (empowerment of children) and the parents’ disconnection and dissociation from risk limit the success of intergenerational learning. The implications of these in relation to flood education, flood preparedness, and household resilience levels are explored.

# Introduction

In the global shift toward devolved responsibility for flood risk management, there is an imperative for increased household involvement in local resilience building (Butler & Pidgeon, 2011; Johnson & Priest, 2008). A principal driver in this policy change has been acknowledgment of the economic and technical limitations of structural flood defenses as the sole solution, given longer-term climate change and projected increased flood exposure (Begg, Walker, & Kuhlicke, 2015; Nye, Tapsell, & TwiggerRoss, 2011). Emphasis is consequently being placed on “learning to live with floods,” including developing a broader range of engagement approaches, as well as adaptation measures at the community and household levels (Geaves & Penning-Rowsell, 2016).

Research focused on effectively communicating climate change identifies children and young people as an under-represented group (Corner et al., 2015). Furthermore, none of the UK government guidance to families at flood risk promotes the involvement of children. This is the case despite research suggesting that the inclusion of children in flood plan formation and implementation may mean that the impact on children experiencing a flood is not as devastating (Peek, 2008; Whittle, Walker, Medd, & Mort, 2012), or isolating as it could be (Vogel & Vernberg, 1993). Involving children directly in developing household resilience planning might also have logistical advantages. For example, older children could be responsible for implementing a flood plan if adults are out at work or are unable to get home due to floodwaters. There is also evidence that beneficial outcomes can occur because children exchange knowledge and understanding with parents and older family members. The value of this reverse intergenerational learning has been illustrated in Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) initiatives (Ballantyne, Connell, & Fien, 1998; Ballantyne, Fein, & Packer, 2001) but less so in the context of environmental risk.

In contrast, children, and particularly young children, are often seen solely as a “vulnerable group” in risk planning (Norris et al., 2002), thereby under-valuing their potential as proactive and effective agents in achieving resilience. Clearly there is an unexplored potential for younger family members to have a greater role in building household resilience to risk. Equally there is value in assessing whether intergenerational learning could be an effective strategy for, and mechanism in, improving local resilience.

This article addresses these questions in relation to a group of young children (ageseven to nine) and their families, through evaluating the impact of a novel participatory methodology. The aims were (i) to evaluate the impact of a specific creative intervention on children’s learning and subsequent agency in flood preparedness within the household, and (ii) to explore the potential of young children to educate and affect change within their families and communities through intergenerational and inter-community learning.

The literature review addresses themes of children, flood risk education, vulnerability, and preparedness and draws across international research in geography, psychology, sociology, and education to explore children as catalysts for change and intergenerational learning. This highlights the need for interdisciplinarity in both theoretical and empirical work and positions the conceptual framing for the research. The methodology section presents the multi-method approach, including participatory activities and semi-structured interviews with children, and subsequent semi-structured telephone interviews with parents/carers. This is followed by thematic analysis of the data, accompanied by an assessment of its implications for research, practice and further investigation.

# Literature review

# Children, vulnerability, and preparedness

Peek (2008, p. 1) emphasized the vulnerabilities and increased psychological and emotional risks to children during disasters, concluding that “in order to promote children’s resilience in this setting, we must improve their access to resources and empower them by encouraging their participation,” crucially recognizing and encouraging the potential and distinctive contribution children can make to disaster preparedness. For households who live in flood risk areas, a key element of the UK environmental regulators’ (Environment Agency (EA), Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Natural Resources Wales (NRW) guidance to residents is to be prepared including having a household flood plan. Similar approaches are also promoted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (FEMA), and Emergency Management Australia (EMA). Evidence suggests that the link (adaptive learning) between flood experience and action is weak (Wachinger, Renn, Begg, & Kuhlicke, 2013). This imperative poses questions about the roles of different family members in terms of “learning for resilience,” with children representing a key (Norris et al., 2002) but under-researched group (Corner et al., 2015; Haynes & Tanner, 2015).

# Learning for resilience

A growing number of initiatives are focused on engaging younger people in learning about flooding, and the importance of “being prepared” (Table 1; see http://www1.uwe.ac.uk/et/research/cfcr for a more detailed version). These range from creative projects co-working within the arts, through to technology-based learning programs, at national and international scales. However, these efforts in linking research, practice, and social learning are currently disjointed, uncoordinated, and the impact of learning interventions is rarely evaluated with limited sharing of feedback. For children and young people (and everyone), methods involved in learning make a difference to how deep and actionable learning is (Davies et al., 2012). Using active participatory and inclusive methodologies with creative stimuli could mean that children engage more positively with a topic that could otherwise be thought of as upsetting, remote (e.g., technology mediated), or dry (through one-way delivery of information).

Some flood education and prevention interventions contain a degree of evaluation, but urgent synthesis is required to evaluate relative effectiveness and ensure credibility and value in local application. In a content analysis of three websites (included in Table 1) containing preparedness materials for children, Ryan, Hocke, and Hilyard. (2012, p. 300), discuss their limitations, emphasizing that “using fear appeals to emphasize severity and susceptibility, which may unintentionally trigger fear control responses in children rather than preparedness behavior.” In a review of methodologies (in 35 studies) in disaster education programs, Johnson, Ronan, Johnston, & Peace (2014), highlighted limitations including an over-emphasis on knowledge acquisition, and the gap in research concerning children’s role in their families and communities, concluding that it is important to pay attention to the affective domain and potential behavioral changes alongside cognitive factors when addressing an emotive subject such as flooding and being flooded.

In the aftermath of the July 2007 floods in North East England (Hull), UK, Whittle, Walker, and Medd (2011) designed a specially commissioned suitcase aimed at children aged 11–14 years. This was designed to act as an educational resource that could be used to stimulate learning about the importance of being prepared for events such as flooding. Although no formal evaluation was completed, the authors emphasized the creativity and physicality of the suitcase and reported on its usefulness in dissemination in a range of settings. SEPA has also produced a range of creative resources to support learning about flooding and preparedness in schools with 9– 10-year-olds (see SEPA website). Working with flood-affected children after the 2007 floods in Hull (UK), Walker et al. (2012, p. 8) found that children can recover quicker both practically and emotionally when they “have some involvement in the repairs and recovery process, such as being included in family discussions or providing practical help.” In the Australian literature, the successful inclusion of evaluated natural hazard education in schools is emphasized (Dufty, 2009). To date, no similar resources in the UK target a younger age group who may benefit cognitively from more participatory and creative stimuli that engage a range of learning styles.

# Intergenerational learning

The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) states that “children’s perspective should be taken on all things that affect them” stressing that they are active, competent agents, have responsibilities, and can be influential in families and communities (http://www.unicef.org/crc/). United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) advocates working with children with a developmental approach to education in emergencies, stressing children’s future role as environmental stewards (Pigozzi, 1999). Furthermore, the Sendai Framework 2015–2030 suggests “Children and Youth are agents of change who should be given the space and modalities to contribute to disaster reduction.” Children’s potential to act as catalysts for change has been explored in environmental education (EE) research (Ballantyne et al., 1998; Connell, Fien, Lee, Sykes, & Yencken, 1999), and a focus on children’s learning through formal education is a key policy strategy in building resilience in communities in some less economically developed countries (Izadkhah & Hosseini, 2005), such as Costa Rica (Vaughan, Gack, Solorazano, & Ray, 2003), El Salvador and the Philippines (Tanner, 2010). Here the messages can be fully expected to be transferred to parents and communities, resulting in valuable intergenerational and intercommunity learning. Cultural issues can inhibit this strategy however. For example, research with children in Java, Indonesia, suggests that they feel unable to influence their parents/communities (Prabawa-Sear, 2015). In the UK, there are fewer examples of this being strategic policy, with children often absent in formal and co-curricular learning concerning preparedness for environmental hazards (Mitchell, Haynes, Hall, Choong, & Oven, 2008).

Through intergenerational and intercommunity learning, there is potential for deeper and broader learning and for information to reach more people, thereby having greater impact. Traditional models of learning assume older generations teach younger, but increasing evidence from a range of practices suggests that this relationship can work just as well in reverse, for example, with technology (Baily,

2009), in business management fields (Chaudhuri & Ghosh, 2012), and in health education (Abraham, Sheeran, & Johnston, 1998). Reversing this traditional model of learning and allowing younger generations to teach and exchange knowledge, influence, and mentor can break down barriers in communication and aid learning. Intergenerational learning has been the focus of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) for some time (Strachan, 2014; Tilbury, 2004; World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987), as well as to some extent within local environmental management education (Ballantyne et al., 1998; Uzell, 1999; Vaughan et al., 2003), and environmental education research (Duvall & Zint, 2007; Sutherland & Ham, 1992). In the hazard preparedness literature, young children’s voices and the potential for intergenerational learning is yet to be explored fully (Haynes & Tanner, 2015).

Research indicates that family relationships and children’s positioning within the wider community can be a crucial predicator of their potential influence. For example, in Costa Rica, importance is placed on environmental education which is focused on children as the main target group with the full expectation that adults will learn from the children. Here investing in children is prioritized by educators because “children constitute a captive audience, represent future environmental stewards, and are more easily taught and influenced than adults” (Vaughan et al., 2003, p. 13). Vaughan et al. (2003) revealed a longer-term improvement in knowledge by the children, their parents, and a control group, suggesting that intergenerational and inter-community learning had taken place and persisted as a result of what children learned. Peek’s (2008) review of research in less economically developed countries further suggests a link between resilient communities and educating children about disaster and risk.

Ballantyne et al. (1998) propose that a key factor to successful intergenerational learning is the reported strength of pre-existing relationships between children and their parents. Similarly, Istead and Shapiro (2014) focused on exploring child-adult learning from the perspectives of five children and their mothers through a series of in-depth interviews. When children were confident and secure in their relationships with their mothers, they reported a high degree of potential influence over their parents. However, it could be argued that families with a less strong or secure pre-existing relationship may find that having their children talk to them about what they have learned, or taking part in educational programs together could strengthen their relationship, as well as increase their mutual knowledge and preparedness.

# Theoretical framing

In developing a theoretical framework to explore these empirical research findings, its dual focus necessitates the drawing on educational and psychological theories as well as disaster preparedness theories. With roots in experiential learning theory (Kolb, 1985, 2014), active learning theory (Hart, 2013) informs our methodology, and can be applied to explain how children learn through the experience of engaging in a novel, creative participatory event (as used in this research). Transformative learning theory (Mezirow, 1997) could explain cases where rapid learning and/or behavior change occur, (PercySmith & Burns, 2013). By exploring parental views about their children’s attempts to transfer learning to them, we can begin to understand more about the factors that influence successful intergenerational learning and its potential to increase preparedness behavior.

Social cognitive theories (Bandura, 1986; Paton, 2003) aid theoretical exploration, and have been used in research concerning preparedness (Becker, Paton, Johnston, & Ronan, 2012Paton, 2003). A range of theoretical models (including Transtheoretical Model, Theory of Planned Behavior, and Protection Motivation Theory) are discussed in relation to emergency preparedness by Paek, Hilyard, Freimuth, Barge, and Mindlin, (2010).

# Methodology

Taking a “new sociology of childhood” approach to avoid tokenistic participation and make efforts to conduct research with children rather than on children (Barrat-Hacking, Cutter-MacKenzie, & Barratt,

2013; Green, 2015), this research is informed by participatory methodological theory. Guided by Shier’s (2001) five-stage model, three principles underpin the participatory nature (Pain & Francis, 2003) of this research. First, the children involved should be active participants in both their involvement as participants in research and as beneficiaries of an effective learning experience. Second, the children should be recognized as a group who can effect change through the research process and contribute to action for climate change. Third, the children are involved in the development of the research stimuli which are carefully designed to be inclusive, active, informative, and creative.

The complex nature of the research gave children the opportunity to act as agents of change within their families and communities. Participatory methodological theory can go some way to allowing this opportunity but there is not a “one size fits all” template, and as such, innovation is needed in the research design (Groundwater-Smith, Dockett, & Bottrell, 2015). That innovation involved skill from the researcher to create a research environment that was both active and participatory for the children, and generated a feeling of empowerment and ownership over the research process (Groundwater-Smith et al., 2015).

# Design issues and process

Working in a school requires a great degree of flexibility and communication between the head teacher, the class teacher, and the researcher in terms of scope and space for learning (Greig, Taylor, & MacKay, 2012; Groundwater-Smith et al., 2015). Consultation with the children was initiated at the start of the research process by the researcher being introduced by the class teacher and spending time in the classroom. This early longitudinal engagement was critical to the research process. Table 2 details the critical information about the different stages of the research.

Sixty-eight children from two schools identified as at flood risk participated in the study (see Table 3), with both located in deprived areas (Index of Multiple Deprivation, 2104). Data collection occurred in three phases, each of which were tested with a small group of children in a home setting before the final roll-out. Phase 1 included children working with the researcher in school in small groups on a co-curricular activity facilitated by a PowerPoint presentation constructed by the researcher and informed by guidance from the environmental regulator (UK Environment Agency, EA) providing local and global examples of flooding which emphasized the importance of “being prepared.” The children made a “treasure box,” which acted as a surrogate for a “grab bag” or a flood box, which was taken home. Previous interactive work with children (Williams, Wright, & Freeman, 2002) underpinned development of the “treasure box” intervention, ensuring research tools were innovative and interesting, resulting in engaged

children (Ballantyne et al., 1998). This activity was participatory and creative, and involved children decorating a plastic box on a pre-prepared table. It was a relatively simple cognitive task centered on creative rather than numeracy or literacy skills ensuring inclusivity of all abilities. The researcher then filled the boxes with key information: a letter about the importance of being prepared to read with/to their families and some other items. Information and suggestions for filling the treasure box were provided in the letter to encourage parents/carers to engage effectively with their children. Crucially this letter contained information (informed by EA) about the importance of being prepared, having a plan, and reducing household risk. Careful attention was paid to specific details, for example:

 That age-appropriate PowerPoint slides contained plentiful engaging images;   
 Emphasis on ownership of the box was created by producing a purpose-made sticker saying “This treasure box belongs to … …’s family”;   
 Using water-themed stickers to decorate the box to boost the association to water and flooding;   
Filling the box with items such as a waterproof plastic wallet and a sticker for children to color when they went home, adding incentive to open the box once it was home.   
 That the treasure box was easy to transport (by a lid handle) so that parents/carers were not instantly disengaged by considering it a burden to carry home.

An example of the treasure box is provided in Figure 1.

In phase 2, one week later, the researcher returned to school and children were individually interviewed. The researcher thanked the class and explained how useful the children’s involvement in the research had been, reassuring them that they had “helped us to understand more about how to help families.” In further de-briefing, the researcher e-mailed the class teacher with the headline results and sent a box of sweets to be shared by the class.

In phase three (one or two weeks later), twenty-one parents across the two case-studies were interviewed using a semi-structured telephone interview (see Table 4 for format) to investigate whether any intergenerational learning and/or changes in the families’ behavior had taken place. Themes addressed parent awareness of the treasure box, engagement with the flood messaging, subsequent conversations with the child and any links to actual or planned behavior change, perceptions on the role of children during floods, and the potential role of children in flood preparedness.

Following guidance to ensure that qualitative research and data analysis were carried out in a thorough and transparent manner (Gibbs, 2002; Welsh, 2002) the transcripts from the work with children and the 21 parental interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed using NVivo (Richards, 1999). The coding process involved initial “careful reading and re-reading of the data” (Rice & Ezzy, 1999) to identify commonalities and patterns. Coding was conducted in two phases. Initial codes were developed to organize the data through a content analysis of the emerging patterns and themes. Using an interpretative approach to the data (Mason, 1996), these initial codes were then combined to produce over-arching thematic codes which were further analyzed and from which quotes were selected to inform and support the research findings (see Figure 2). Validation of the themes was achieved through a blind inter-rater reliability test with a colleague. Participants had the opportunity to withdraw from the research through a letter to parents, and in both cases the school acted as a broker. Ethical clearance was obtained through the host university; UK law requires that adults working with children hold a Disclosure and Barring Certificate (DBS) certificate.

# Results

This section begins by analyzing the potential of the group work and treasure box activity to be an effective way to engage children ages seven to nine in thinking and learning about flooding, and about the importance of being prepared. Themes emerging from interviews with children and parents in relation to intergenerational learning follow.

# Engaging children in learning about flood preparation

The group work and treasure box intervention were very popular with the children who thought it “Epic” (child age seven) and “So cool. I wish we could do this everyday” (child age seven) and also when they remembered the activity one week later “…we made a special box for flooding with stickers and mine is really cool and I’ve put it in my room” (child age eight). Teachers also agreed that the intervention had “generated a buzz in the school” and that “the children loved making them [the treasure boxes].”

Parents also commented positively on the intervention:

![](img/561c7ad06b3016fc31c6ed9e982073d119a01178ff1f40a45e88cef566d1cde5.jpg)  
Figure 2. Thematic analysis showing levels of coding and final codes.

Yes. If they had just come home with the letter, you get loads of letters, I don’t know whether I would have paid so much attention to it. I might have listened to [name] but I may not have kind of got into it the same. The box is so visible. The kids, well [name] was really excited, and her group were so excited by it. (parent of child age eight)

She was really keen on the project, it really sparked her imagination. (parent of child age nine)

The key issue and measure of success was whether the children remembered the information, and whether they took the treasure boxes home and filled them with appropriate items. Evidence from the interviews with the children is provided in Table 5

Children remembered the information about flooding and recalled a high level of detail about the group work, and about making the treasure boxes which in all but one case were taken home. There was a difference between the ages of children and the likelihood that the children filled the box with appropriate items, with the younger age group (seven to eight years) filling the box less often and with less relevant items.

The group work and treasure box intervention combined the reality of the experiences of flooding with a fun creative task. Themes emerging from the group work with children revealed a high level of empathy and understanding of the negative effects of flooding. In response to global photographs of international flood-affected people, children talked about life being “hard”; that “they might lose their home and toys’. In the post-intervention interviews, children reported that they had talked with their families about “praying” for recent flood victims and about making and sending useful items. The parental interviews confirmed these reports.

# Intergenerational learning

A high percentage of children $( 7 5 \% )$ reported that they had talked to a parent or family member about flooding, suggesting a degree of intergenerational communication. Conversations occurred mainly between parents (Mum mentioned 56 times, and Dad mentioned 44 times) and siblings (mentioned 34 times), but also with grandparents (mentioned 8 times), uncles, aunts, and cousins (mentioned 6 times). Most of these conversations were initiated by the children telling their family members about flooding and about the treasure box, or by the parents asking the children what the box was for.

In sixteen cases $( 1 1 \% )$ , children reported that deeper conversations had occurred in their family. Some of these involved parents making suggestions about what to include, and helping their children to fill their box. In five cases, the children indicated that they had done something more once they got home; one revealed that he and his Dad had visited the river and talked about the defences; one said he had written and told a story to his family and relayed this to the researcher. One child said she had made a PowerPoint to show to her family and two said that they had looked for information on the Internet:

I went to the river with my Dad and he told me we won’t flood because we have “The Cut” (local river flood defenses). (Case study 1: age nine)

Mum helped fill the box, looked at youtube, made another box. (Case study 1: age nine)   
Mum and dad said they could put passports inside. (Case study 1: age nine)   
Mum put plaster inside. (Case study 1: age nine)   
Mum and dad said they’d learned some stuff that they didn’t know about flooding. (Case study 1: age eight)   
We had a family meeting and I made a powerpoint. (Case study 1: age eight)   
Mum suggested that Dad come over and he let me put a first aid kit in. I made a story about flooding for my little   
sister. (Case study 2: age nine)

These reports from the children were confirmed by the parents:

Yes she did. She said she would put in a raincoat because she would need it to keep dry. She would put in her wind up radio so she could keep updated with the news so she knew what was happening. […] We were looking in the medical cabinet in the bathroom and she said, we will take those ones because they are waterproof. I think with the plasters she had symbolised more than I thought. I think she was trying to symbolise first aid. She put a soft toy in … one her brother brought her when she was born. So she put something that was precious to her in there. […] She said, this is important because it is my first toy so it is something that is important to me. She put a torch in there as well. The water will be dark” (Case study 2: Mother of child ageeight)

In $1 4 \%$ of cases, children reported that conversations with their parents did not occur. This was attributed in many cases (21 overall) to parents not having time or to the stress created by younger siblings.

I started telling my Dad but he didn’t listen cause the baby was crying his head off. (Case study 2: age eight)

Although in one case (older) siblings aided further investigation by the child:

I talked to my big brother cause he’s got a computer in his room and we saw on Sky news there was lots of them [floods]. (Case study 2: age nine)

Some parents also suggested time and family constraints limited their ability to engage with their children:

No. I don’t really recall because it is really hard, looking after a baby. I have a vague recollection that he was mentioning about those and I just told him that every time, we will do that next time, look at your brother, he is crying. So I never had a chance to go back to him and shape a discussion regarding that. He didn’t really ask me again. It sounds like I will have to pay more attention to what he is telling us. (Case study 1: Father of nine-year-old)

There was some evidence of inter-community learning, with some of the parents revealing that they had talked to friends and neighbors outside the family about flooding.

But I did read the letter. It helped; it helped my friend as well. (Case study 1: mother of nie-year-old)

We talked as mothers. Because they had all got, we were really pleased…… They are kind of aware of emergency services but this was like a step on in a way. A little group of mothers, like a friendship group, thought “oh wow’” (Case study 1: mother of eight-year-old)

# Thematic analysis of parent interviews

In all but one of the parental interviews, parents were aware of the treasure box and that it was related to work the children had done on flooding at school. Several key themes emerged from the thematic analysis of the parental interviews. It should be restated that out of 21 interviews, only one interview was conducted with a male parent/carer.

# Theme 1: Empowerment / disempowerment of children as a catalyst to learning

One key issue when considering children as potential catalysts for change is whether children are given “permission” within their families, communities, and societies to educate, influence, or affect change. During the group work intervention in school, children were empowered and encouraged by the researcher to talk about what they had learned with their families. In some cases, it was clear that the parents were unable and/or unwilling to allow their children to influence them, believing that they, as adults and/or parents, should educate their children. Thus, children may have experienced the feeling of disempowerment and an inability to educate or influence:

…..I think it is more of the parents, your role is more important. As a parent it is about keeping them safe, I wouldn’t see that they [children] have a particular role. (Case study 1: mother of eight-year-old) I showed him how things happen, the most places it happens. (Case Study 1: father of nine-year-old) She probably did [talk about the treasure box] but I have got two [children] at that school, so I just tend to agree! That sounds awful. (Case study 1: mother of seven-year-old)

When children were given the consent to exert a degree of influence, conversations were deeper and parents more open:

Yes. I think to be honest she is more prepared than we are! (Case study 1: mother of nine-year-old)   
I said to put it in her bedroom but she said that was not helpful, it needed to be somewhere you could grab it. She   
was really interested. (Case study 1: mother of nine-year-old)   
So he was talking about the floods down there and how it could affect people which was quite grown up talking”   
(Case study 1: mother of nine-year-old)

# Theme 2: Disconnection

In some cases, there was a sense of disconnection in the interviews suggesting that parents were viewing the subject as a school project rather than something that might be of personal relevance. This may be a consequence of locating the research in a formal educational setting (school).

The children must worry about it when they see it on the telly. It is good that the schools are getting involved and talking about it. (Case study 1: mother of eight-year-old)

This disconnection was also evident with parents, suggesting a negation or denial of risk:

Because you don’t really think it is going to happen, you don’t really talk about it. (Case study 1: mother of eightyear-old)

Or that flood events happen elsewhere:

No. I think it was interesting for the children to plan for events like that. It does not happen here, when you are on holiday [abroad]. (Case study 1: mother of nine-year-old)

Grandad told me about a flood in India. He had to stay in the house. Then he came here and now it is safe. Grandma said there is no flood here…... (Case study 1: child age eight)

These quotes also suggest some important cultural differences. One school had a high level of cultural diversity, which resulted in two important findings. First, the children were acutely aware, interested, and proud to point out and talk about their families’ country of origin during the group work, when looking at the map and associated pictures of floods around the world. Second, the UK is seen as a place of “safety” to families who may have experienced flooding as a different and more extreme experience.

# Theme 3: Contradiction

All parents interviewed strongly agreed (on a Likert scale) that children should know about and be involved in making plans to deal with flooding. Some suggested involvement from age four and some from age nine. This would include most children involved in this research, suggesting that in principle parents feel that children should know about and be involved in flood preparations while they are at primary school. Parents also suggested a range of ages (3 to 13 years) as to when children should be involved practically in helping within the family and community after a flood—although many— $4 8 \%$ —suggested their own child’s age of seven to nine years.

There was a level of contradiction between parents’ responses to these generic questions and ques tions asked about their own children. This is evidenced by one parent who gave strong indication (5 on a Likert scale 1–5) that children should be involved in preparing and planning and helping practically, but had earlier replied in answer to a question about her child’s role:

I don’t know really, I think she might be too young, I think she would panic. (Case study 2: Mother of eight-yearold)

Eight parents indicated their intention to do more because of involvement in this research process. This may have been the influence of the researcher’s phone call, which highlights the importance of the research process itself in triggering reflection. Suggestions of what they intended to do ranged from “finding out more,” to looking on the Internet, to making a flood plan. Most parents said that they would not be doing anything further mostly because they felt informed already, that they were not at risk of flooding or that they could rely on flood defenses/local services. The latter may indicate a deferral of responsibility to agencies for dealing with flood risk management. Some evidence suggested behavior change toward increased preparedness because some parents helped their children to fill their treasure boxes, but there was little evidence beyond that. One parent, however, suggested that they had been making additional preparations:

That we have done! What I have been doing is stocking the food up with tins, making sure the cupboards are full so if we, if there is an emergency at least we have food to eat. I might not have done everything on the list but I have done a little bit. (Case study 2: mother of eight-year-old)

# Discussion

# Implications for childhood learning

A participatory creative event resulted in young children thinking and learning about flooding and engaging with preparedness. The younger (seven to eight years) group of children reported filling their treasure boxes at home with appropriate items less often than the older children (eight–nine years). This could reflect subtle differences in development (cognitive, affective, and social), and particularly in translating learning into specific (independent) behaviors, illustrating the essential differences within relatively narrow age ranges. This suggests the need to ensure that educational resources and programs are age-appropriate. As noted earlier, many current educational resources aimed at flood education for children are not evaluated, and include computer-based games, stories, and videos. Some of these suggest suitability to age ranges of 4–17 years (see Table 1 and the weblink). Given the developmental range in childhood, it is unlikely that one method and/or resource will be cognitively appropriate for such an age range (Piaget, 1972; Shute & Slee, 2015). These resources may also fail to take account of the emotional responses and potential fear that children may experience when thinking about “risk” subjects such as floods (Peek, 2008).

Using the group work with its associated co-learning, and treasure box methodology made flooding and its effects real for children, something that could be difficult to achieve through online resources and games. Experiential learning theory would suggest that this collective experience influenced the success in young children’s learning (Kolb, 1985, 2014). During the group discussions, children talked about the experiences of people that they saw in the photographs. Empathy was displayed by children thinking about the effects of flooding on peoples’ lives. This was confirmed by parents of the children suggesting that they had talked with their families and had prayed for or acted altruistically (making and sending blankets). This may also result in deeper and more meaningful learning with thinking, empathy, and altruism (Eisenberg & Miller, 1987).

# Implications for intergenerational learning

Children talked to their families about flooding because of the group work and treasure box, and where parents reported their child had a high level of engagement with the intervention, there was more learning by both the children and parents, suggesting a reverse intergenerational learning effect. More deeply, securely attached adults and children are more likely to be open to learning together (Mikulincer & Florian, 1998). So, the results may also indicate a relationship between learning and attachment, and have something to say about adults’ confidence levels and parenting techniques—that secure attachment both in adults and children will result in higher levels of learning and preparedness. It is challenging to assess whether transformative learning (Mezirow, 1997) could have occurred for both child and adult due to methodological and time limitations in this research, but clearly this is a line of research that warrants further investigation with a longitudinal design. Children learning and transferring learning to their families and communities is a strategy that works elsewhere where there is political will and cultural acceptance (Vaughan et al., 2003), and it has the potential to be implemented in the UK (Maddox, Doran, Williams, & Kus, 2011).

We must also acknowledge that there were parents who did not engage in conversations about flooding or with the treasure box. Flood risk areas are often also areas of higher socioeconomic need (as in the areas within this research), and evidence suggests that parents in such areas may be less engaged with their children (Bradley & Corwyn, 2002). This could indicate that the treasure box intervention, and many one-off interventions, are severely limited in their ability to influence and affect parents and families in settings that may be particularly vulnerable, although a comparative and more affluent area should be included in further research to investigate this more fully. It also supports the need for families in these areas to receive more scaffolded and targeted interventions leading to impacts that are more likely to be sustained (McLoyd, 1998; Yoshikawa, Aber, & Beardslee, 2012). Investigating these family relationships, personality characteristics, and attitudes and beliefs about response and action could help us understand more about lack of preparedness and barriers to behavior change, and inform measures that could help develop increased capital.

It was observed that in some cases children were not given the role or permission to act as catalysts to adult learning. An assumption that adults (and parents) should be the ones who educate children could result in a reluctance of parents to allow children to be “Knowledge Holders” unlike Vaughan et al.’s (2003) findings in Costa Rica. This could also be because the research was conducted in a formal educational setting, and so parents were predisposed to view the information as if it was part of a school project and at a distance, therefore not affecting them personally. Conducting further research in societies with different child-parent relations, and in informal and formal settings, for example, community/social learning settings, would allow closer examination of the factors that impact both intergenerational learning and its potential transferability from specific settings.

Analysis of the parental interviews identified three main themes: (dis)empowerment, disconnection, and contradiction. Research in ESD emphasizes a whole “project approach” to teaching sustainability practices at an increasingly early age (pre-school) (Siraj-Blatchford, 2015). This involves empowering children and giving them some autonomy and influence; the idea is that values and attitudes formed early in life will remain and be strong enough to result in more sustainable behaviors in adulthood. The links between feelings of power and control over situations, and [mental] health and wellness are well established in adults (Ryan & Deci, 2000). Recognizing a lacuna in similar research with children, Prilleltensky, Nelson, and Peirson (2001) found that power and control were also linked with [mental] wellness in children. Importantly, they suggested a developmental (learning) characteristic that may sometimes be missed by parents who are reluctant to give their children power and control. Empowering children in educational settings is a common aspiration; building the relationship between children and schools and encouraging parents’ involvement in children’s education meets with limited success even in the most well designed school (Hoover-Dempsey, & Sandler, 1997). The empowerment children felt during the group work in school with the researcher resulted in some children believing that they could educate their families about flooding, and that they could help their families and communities prepare for a flood event using the treasure box (acting as a grab bag). Applying an empowerment theory approach (Zimmerman, 2000) to preparedness behavior, empowered children who have meaningful conversations and engage in some preparedness behavior with their parents may become more prepared adults and reduce their reliance on third parties. Feeling disempowered as they tried (and failed) to talk to their families may have a very negative effect on children’s confidence to affect change, and on their developing values and attitudes. This could result in “learned helplessness” (Seigleman, 1975), deferral of responsibility and in an over-reliance on others, with implications for their potential functioning as young adults. It is also important that the researcher de-briefs children who may be left feeling disempowered by their involvement in the research process.

The second theme identified evidence of disconnection and “Not In My Back Yard” attitudes (Norgaard, 2011) explained through cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1962). There was evidence of reliance on the perceived effectiveness of flood defenses, local government, and government agencies, placing the responsibility to prepare for floods elsewhere. A developmental effect could also be evident as children who perceive that their parents do not want to know or talk about flooding (or prepare or take personal responsibility), may develop similar opinions and retain limited awareness. This could result in a consequent lack of action or intention to prepare and a continued reliance on third parties to ensure safety, so reducing overall resilience at the household level. Paek et al. (2010) used the transtheoretical model (TTM) to understand more about emergency preparedness in health settings and suggested factors relating to social cognitive theories (Fiske & Taylor, 2013) of self-efficacy, subjective norms, and media effects as main influencing factors.

A level of disconnection was evident in the research as parents believed that children should know about, and be involved in, preparations and family flood plans but were less supportive of their own children’s involvement within the home. As an extension of the group work and treasure box intervention, future research could concentrate on how family flood plans can be co-developed, with children and parents engaging and working and learning together. This would also support the development of flood education strategies that include an element of reverse intergenerational learning, as has been shown to be effective in environmental education in some countries (Izadkhah & Hosseini, 2005; Vaughan et al., 2003).

There was little evidence of any disclosed change in behavior in parents beyond conversations that occurred as a result of the children taking the treasure box home. This could be because not all households involved in the study were at flood risk (although proximal to these areas), and so there was no incentive to change behavior in the household. Questions focused on the importance of supporting the wider community members; the school community that may experience flooding did not generate any evidence of behavior change. Adapting the design to facilitate children and parents “learning together” in a less formal setting may result in transformative learning and consequent behavior change, but to investigate transformative learning and observe behavior change, a longer period of intervention and time is required, recognizing the complex processes involved in changing behavior (Azjen, 1985; Mesirow, 1997).

A combination of educational, psychological, and behavior change theories can provide explanation about the potential for intergenerational learning and children’s role as catalysts. The method used here did not support the exploration of parent-child relationships other than to suggest that the empowerment of children, developmental issues, socioeconomic factors, the development of values and attitudes, and the quality of the parental relationship as well as the political steer, are crucial in predicting whether children will be taken seriously in their attempts to affect change. This operates on family, community, and national levels. Further research isolating these factors more fully within the methodological design will allow thorough investigation. A theoretical framework detailing how children can be involved in flood risk management should also be developed.

# Limitations of the methodology and future research directions

Researching with children is challenging. The method used here was participatory and engaging, and the researcher was skilled and experienced in researching with children resulting in an effective method for investigating how and what young children can learn about flooding. However, there were limitations within the methodology that could be addressed through further research (see Table 6).

# Conclusions and implications

This article addresses an acknowledged gap in flood education research and learning for resilience by young children (aged seven to nine years) and their families. Using an action-based, participatory methodology, a creative and inclusive flood education resource was developed as a stimulus for learning. Children expressed interest and enjoyment during the classroom session, and parents and teachers reported that this enthusiasm had persisted beyond the initial engagement. Knowledge retention by children was high, with notable levels of empathy and understanding about the negative impacts of flooding evident during, and after, the initial session. We therefore consider the approach of a one-off intervention to have been successful in engaging young children and in facilitating co-learning in formal educational settings.

A second aim of the research was to investigate the potential for young children to be agents in intergenerational learning and in improving household resilience. Interviews with parents revealed several examples of children transferring messages learned in school to home, some of which led to a wider exchange of knowledge about flooding. There is clearly the potential for reverse intergenerational learning to occur, but also for further learning that arises from the subsequent exchange of information within and beyond the family. In some cases, these conversations were followed by actions (e.g., children filled the treasure boxes). This suggests that creative, participatory approaches could be effective in not only helping young children learn about flooding, but also translating this knowledge into actions at home, leading to improved resilience.

However, in many instances the intervention did not result in any identifiable improved household preparedness. Thematic analysis suggests key factors such as family relationships (empowerment of children), and the disconnection and dissociation from risk limits the success of intergenerational learning. Nevertheless, the value of including children in household-level flood planning was acknowledged by teachers, parents, and the children themselves. Rather than considering children just as a ”highly vulnerable” group in flood risk management, we suggest they, as citizens, are potentially effective agents in both intergenerational learning and in playing an active part in building household resilience.

If this is to be realized, there are several urgent needs. First, public policy should explicitly recognize the value and potential contribution of children in household resilience planning. Secondly, similar approaches using a range of age-appropriate materials should be trialed for a greater range of ages, and in a variety of socioeconomic and flood-risk settings. These could include multiple learning interventions over a longer timeline, and more detailed evaluation of the factors promoting or limiting intergenerational learning and translation of knowledge into household action. Whereas this study focused on classroom activities, further effort could focus on designing and evaluating subsequent family-based activities in learning for resilience.
