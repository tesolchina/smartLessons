# ABSTRACT

Affordance refers to the opportunity available to a learning activity. Taking affordance as a theoretical and analytical construct, this exploratory study investigates learners’ attitudes and the opportunities WeChat may provide for Chinese cultural knowledge (CCK) learning. The aim is to find out the potential new affordances and compare learners with different language levels. 24 participants were paired with native Chinese speakers and required to complete three-stage activities with the integration of WeChat. This study adopted a mix-method approach. Data were collected through questionnaires, two rounds of semi-structured interviews, chat logs, and WeChat moments. It is found that most learners were positive toward the activities and WeChat provided learners with opportunities for interaction and collaboration, for resource sharing, for knowledge internalization and construction, and for sustainable learning and friendship maintaining. The affordance of knowledge internalization and construction was mentioned with the highest frequency in the interview. The findings that distinguish this study from previous ones are: (1) the affordance for sustainable learning, and (2) differences between high-level (HL) and low-level (LL) learners. In comparison, the activities won more supports from HL learners, and HL learners’ frequency in leveraging the affordance for resource sharing and sustainable learning was also higher. Pedagogical implications and research recommendations were provided respectively in discussion and conclusion parts.

# 1.  Introduction

Language and culture are inseparable to each other. Culture learning is an essential component of learning a foreign language. According to Ho (2009), culture can be divided into external culture and internal culture. External culture is usually associated with explicitly learned knowledge, which is gained experientially through reading, seeing, hearing or touching while internal culture is acquired implicitly. In other words, internal culture pertains to values, beliefs, myths and thought patterns, which is often linked with one’s first language (L1). In contrast, external culture is often linked with a foreign/second language (L2) and it is subject to changes and constitutes objective knowledge. In this study, Chinese cultural knowledge (CCK) refers to external culture one would need to learn when she/he learns Chinese as an L2. Although L2 Learners’ understandings of Chinese culture are improving with the progress of target language proficiency, its complexity and dynamicity still impose challenges for CCK learners. Lately researchers (e.g. Huang, 2019; Jiang & Li, 2018; Jin, 2018) have been seeking ways by employing mobile technologies to scaffold Chinese language and culture learning.

WeChat is one of such technologies that attracts great attention around the globe. With features comparable to other famous tools including Facebook, Twitter, and Skype, it supports synchronous and asynchronous interaction, and offers a seamless learning opportunity without time and location constraints (Loewen et  al., 2019; Shadiev et  al., 2017). By July 28th, 2020, WeChat monthly active users have reached 1.2 billion (DMR, 2020). With the advantages and great influence, WeChat has been increasingly introduced into language and culture learning. But most studies target at linguistic skills such as speaking (Jiang & Li, 2018; Jin, 2018; Shi et  al., 2017), vocabulary (Sung & Poole, 2017), writing (Wang & Jiang, 2021), or a combination of grammar and vocabulary (Xu & Peng, 2017), instead of focusing on specific cultural knowledge. In addition, the volume utilizing WeChat for an educational purpose is limited compared with prior studies on technologies of Facebook (Barrot, 2018), Twitter (Chawinga, 2017), Ipads (Mathieu, 2021), and Skype (Lee et  al., 2019). WeChat has deeply penetrated Chinese people’s social and professional lives (Jin, 2018), for a China-based cultural exchange program, there remains an area for the exploration of WeChat application in CCK learning.

To explore the opportunities WeChat may provide for language and culture learners, researchers (e.g. Jin, 2018; Wang et  al., 2016; Xue & Churchill, 2019) used affordance, ecologically and socio-culturally equivalent to the opportunity here, as a theoretical and analytical construct and exemplified a number of WeChat affordances for language and culture learning. With the updates of mobile features and pedagogical designs, more affordances of WeChat are to be found in this domain. Given the importance of learners’ attitudes on mobile learning (M-learning) acceptance (e.g. García Botero et  al., 2018; Lawson-Body et  al., 2020), investigating attitudes is necessary before exploring affordances.

The aim of the current study is to find out the potential new affordances of WeChat and compare learners with different language levels. This study is significant because the potential affordances of WeChat may strengthen the confidence of educators to apply mobile technologies to teaching practice if the affordances are well received by learners. By comparing the results of different learner groups, the findings may serve as a reference for practitioners to take effective teaching measures catering to learners with various language proficiencies. In order to achieve the research objectives, the following research questions will be investigated to guide the study.

RQ1: What are the attitudes of different learners toward WeChat activities for Chinese cultural knowledge learning?

RQ2: What are the affordances of WeChat perceived by high-level and low-level learners respectively in learning Chinese cultural knowledge?

# 2.  Literature review

# 2.1.  The concept of affordance from an ecological and sociocultural perspective

Affordance was previously explained by an American psychologist James Gibson (1979) as ‘what [the environment] offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill’ (p. 127, emphasis in the original). Neisser (1987) used it as ‘relations of possibility between animals and their environments’ (p. 21). Varela et  al. (1991) viewed it as a part ‘consisting in the opportunities for interaction that things in the environment possess relative to the sensorimotor capacities of the animal’ (p. 203). But van Lier (2004) defined affordance as ‘what is available to the person to do something with’ (p. 91). Despite various definitions given, concepts such as opportunity, environment, relation, interaction, and availability were highlighted. Inspired by the highlights, mobile affordance here refers to the opportunity that mobile technologies may offer for learners’ learning activity.

Based on the tenets of sociocultural theory (SCT) (Vygotsky, 1978), learners are viewed as active agents in their learning and constructers of meaning (Lantolf & Pavlenko, 2001). Instead of focusing only on learner agents, language from an ecological perspective is seen as a system of relations in an environment which is full of potential meanings, ecology therefore involves ‘the study of the context’ (van Lier, 2004, p. 11). In sociocultural theory, one central construct for language and culture learning is mediation, which means learners use social activities, artifacts (e.g. tasks and technology), and concepts to connect with others, and the environment (Lantolf, 2006). Combining ecological and sociocultural theories, it is contended that culture learning, similar to language learning, is a meaning-making activity mediated by the semiotic resources available in the learning environment (van Lier, 2004). Affordance occurs when ‘the meanings become available gradually as learner acts and interacts within and with this environment’ (van Lier, 2000, p. 246).

# 2.2.  Mobile affordances for language and culture learning

Culture is interpreted as groupness (Lindsay et  al., 1999), which is identified by language, geographical location, religion, clothing, food, and so on. Culture can also be recognized by age, profession, sports, and technology (Levy, 2007). Mobile-assisted culture learning (MACL), as the specialization of M-learning, refers to learning specific culture with handheld digital devices. Works on MACL have been developing along with mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) for more than two decades since 2008 (Duman, Orhon, & Gedik, 2015), but early research rested on a teacher-centered model (Burston, 2014; Shadiev et  al., 2017), and the results of most studies were not reliable and objective (Burston, 2015).

For MALL and MACL, all mobile technologies have their own particular affordances (Reinders & Pegrum, 2015). Studies to operationalize affordance within a mobile environment are on a rising trend (Thoms & Poole, 2017). These affordances were partly reviewed by Kukulska-Hulme and Viberg (2018), and further analyzed by Shadiev et  al. (2020) with the integration of authentic environments. For example, mobile games provide English learners opportunities for socialization and engage students in collaborative learning (Hwang et  al., 2016). Researchers such as Liu, Chen, and Hwang (2018), Yudhiantara and Nuryantini (2019), use collaboration as a strategy for students to improve specific language skills. Mobile devices could also provide an access for cultural authenticity (Fomani & Hedayayi, 2016), language resources (Andujar, 2016; Wang & Jiang, 2021), a space for self-evaluation (Kirsch, 2016), and so on. Compared with other popular mobile technologies, WeChat has its own uniqueness with regard to its cultural background, degree of usability and privacy settings (Hou et  al., 2020). Hence, there is a need to review the affordances of WeChat in Chinese language and culture learning area.

# 2.3.  WeChat affordances for Chinese language and culture learning

2.3.1.  A platform for interaction and collaboration For distance reason, WeChat is commonly used to link up learners with native speakers (NSs) for learning Chinese language and culture. For example, Wang et  al. (2016) conducted an interview to explore the teaching, social and cognitive presences emerging out of language exchange between Chinese-English dyads from two universities. The transcripts of peer feedback indicated that leaners’ cultural misunderstandings were diminishing through their discussion on problematic language use with NSs. Jin (2018) explored WeChat affordances for learning Chinese by paring two learners with NSs in a seven-week China-based program. WeChat was used as an online community for notice updates and free exchange among group members. Through a weekly survey, a semi-structured interview and participatory observations, the author found the affordance for authentic meaning-focused communication between learners and NSs. Jiang and Li (2018) integrated WeChat task into a 13-week spoken Chinese course through topic-related ask and answer between second-year learners and NSs on the same campus in Australia. In the interview, the students confirmed the affordance for pair interaction.

# 2.3.2.  An access to learning resources

WeChat provides learners with an independent access to various cultural materials and resources (Barrs, 2011). To improve learners’ native cultural awareness, Wu and Miller (2021) utilized WeChat to engage English learners in a two-cycle out-of-class dialogue project. No topics were given in Cycle 1, while Cycle 2 consisted of four modules (topic planning, preparation, production and reflection). Data were collected through interviews, chat logs, and a teacher journal. The learners reported an increase of cultural resources through online searches. Huang (2019) adopted a mixed-method design in a 12-week cultural exchange program. Students were advised in Round 1 but required in Round 2 to post threads in Chinese on WeChat. Combining both rounds of online performance, questionnaires and informal interviews, results showed that WeChat afforded elementary learners with cultural artifacts. Parallel results were found in Sung and Poole’s (2017) study on five Chinese-English dyads’ attitudes toward WeChat tasks (texting, voice tasks, and camera tasks) in a seven-week tandem language learning project. With an analysis on the transcripts of students’ online conversation and an online survey, it was found that WeChat provided learners with an access to cultural artifacts and music. By observing learners’ online communication, Jin (2018) found that WeChat offered an opportunity for the HL learner to acquire urban slang.

# 2.3.3.  A space for feedback

WeChat offers an opportunity for learners to receive feedback from teachers or NSs. For instance, Xu and Peng (2017) used WeChat for learners of Chinese to receive feedback from NSs on their oral expression. By interviewing, learners confirmed the effects of mobile-assisted feedback in improving their linguistic and cultural literacy. Apart from cultural communication, Wang et  al. (2016) also recognized that WeChat became the medium for Chinese-English dyads to give corrective feedback on each other’s oral and written production, which enabled both dyads deep understandings of grammatical cultural meanings. By the same token, in Sung and Poole (2017)’s initiative to link novice-level Chinese-English dyads with mobile-assisted tasks, learners spoke highly of the form of error corrections for an increase of lexical cultural knowledge on both ends.

The literatures above exemplify three affordances on WeChat for Chinese language and culture learning. In the meantime, the influence of learners’ language level on the emergence of digital affordance was implicitly or explicitly announced in some studies (Huang, 2019; Jiang & Li, 2018; Jin, 2018; Sung & Poole, 2017), which implies a need to compare the groups of different levels in WeChat affordance analysis.

# 3.  Methodology

# 3.1.  Research context

As part of a long-term program, this exploratory study was conducted in a southwestern university in mainland China in the second quarter of 2019. The university is in a downtown with 40 minutes’ subway ride away from the airport. The cultural exchange program was held annually by VAICE, the name of a student-initiated and teacher-led team under the guidance of the Office of International Cooperation and Exchange at the host university. The program was designed for the incoming learners of Chinese to be paired up with NS volunteers who served as Chinese language partners. Both the learners and NSs were required to provide IELTS report $( \gtrapprox 6 . 5 )$ before they start an application for participating.

# 3.2.  NS volunteer recruitment

In April, 2019, advertisement was posted on the official website1 for recruiting NSs from the host university. The applicants were required to fill in an application form downloaded from the official website. They were required to attend a face-to-face interview with the first author respectively to check whether they could speak English and standard Chinese. The candidates recruited had a one-week training in etiquette and rules of scaffolding. The training consisted of seven classes with each class beginning at 19:00 and ended at 20:00 every day. The contents of training were etiquette of dressing, communicating, eating behavior, and the like. On the rules of scaffolding, the volunteers would need to help mainly in off-campus cultural resource collection and written presentation on WeChat, for example, making a daily trip plan, serving as a local tour guide, interpreting and explaining, collaboratively discussing and constructing the cultural presentation, and so forth. However, they were informed not to take international students toward any place with danger, not to draft the presentation for learners of Chinese, and not to hold any cultural stance or bias while discussing with each other.

# 3.3.  Participants

24 learners of Chinese participated in this study. Details of the 24 learners were shown in Table 1. Before coming to China, six learners $( 2 5 \% )$ usually used WeChat, five learners $( 2 0 . 8 3 \% )$ sometimes used it, four learners $( 1 6 . 6 7 \% )$ seldom used it, while nine learners $( 3 7 . 5 \% )$ have never used WeChat. The oral Chinese test was designed for learners on the basis of national test syllabus (HANYU KOUYU SHUIPING CESHI, abbreviated as HKC) and consisted of reading (Chinese character, phrases and sentences), question answering, story retelling, picture describing, and topic discussing. The assessment measurements of the oral test were presented in Supplementary Appendix 1. Learners were divided into HL and LL groups according to their test reports. As a result, 12 learners were enrolled in HL group, eight of them were highly fluent both in speaking and writing (with eight to fifteen years of learning), and the other four were fluent only in speaking (with two to four years of learning). LL group consisted of 12 beginner learners of Chinese with no more than two years of learning experience. All the learners had a self-rating of their Chinese levels to check whether they were appropriately grouped. The frequency of WeChat use could not predict learners’ language level. In other words, the student who seldom used WeChat was not necessarily at a low Chinese level, and vice versa.

‘P’ stands for Participant.

An instructor specialized in CCK teaching and one researcher with four years’ English teaching experience from the host university were in charge of running the program. One research assistant was employed to follow the daily routine. The learners interviewed for enrollment were required to have a smartphone and to install WeChat App. In the meantime, a user manual was prepared for the learners. For those who have never used WeChat before, they would get help from their NS language partners till they were familiar with WeChat features.

# 3.4.  Procedure of the program

This exchange program lasted for three weeks from the 6th to the 24th May, 2019. It started with an opening ceremony in the university auditorium on the orientation day. Given the recommendation by Jiang and Li (2018) that learners should be given options to work with NSs they prefer, the participants were allowed to select their own language partners after NSs’ self-introductions. The learning pair were set up the moment a particular NS was chosen. The last dyad automatically became a pair. In deciding the language for group chat, learners have self-rated their English and Chinese levels. In comparison, most learners tended to text in English, some used both Chinese and English. Given the learners’ different Chinese levels, and that all learners have provided IELTS reports, English was set as a lingua franca for the written task, but the learners were free to choose Chinese or English in private interactions. The learning pairs added each other to be WeChat friends and all joined the group chat of the program on the first orientation day. The three-stage learning activities were designed as follows and shown in Figure 1.

# 3.4.1.  First-stage activity: initial understanding

It was a before-class preview activity. The instructor would share files falling within a weekly topic (in Table 2) via WeChat group including articles, videos, or slides the night before class. Learners were encouraged to read and understand by themselves, raise questions and join in discussion. The instructor recorded the questions, and would detail the topic-related contents in class.

# 3.4.2.  Second-stage activity: combining

It was a daily outdoor activity for topic-related cultural resource collection after the morning class. The learners were supposed to combine curriculum with outdoor field work. They worked in pairs to experience and explore Chinese culture at different corners of the city. The pairs were both the planners and the implementors. Hours and locations for cultural resource collection were flexible. The only requirement was that they need to share what they saw in texts, audios, photos, or videos via group chat, the first author kept monitoring the group chat to ensure they were on track with the task.

# 3.4.3.  Third-stage activity: constructing

This was a cultural knowledge construction process. Learners were required to combine classroom learning with real-life experience, and make presentations in a written form. They were allowed to seek scaffolding, for example, in selecting resource, in taking records, and in outlining the structure, from their partners and the instructor before presentation. The digital written presentation started at 19:00 every day in the form of text with photos, with short videos, and so on. Simultaneous discussions were carried out among peers. The instructor would not interfere unless misunderstanding occurred. Comments on learners’ performance were made by the instructor at the very end.

# 3.4.4.  Assessment and rewards

Assessment on learners’ three-stage performance was measured under a 100-mark system (first stage $2 5 \% +$ second stage $2 5 \% +$ third stage $5 0 \%$ ) by their respective partners and the instructor. The measurements at each stage were detailed in Supplementary Appendix 2. The scoring process was monitored by the first author, and learners’ daily marks were double-calculated by the research assistant. At the end of the program, learners would receive their final learning reports. Each report was the total of learners’ respective daily marks. Certificates were issued to learners based on their final reports. In the meantime, the language partner would earn an honor award for his/her outstanding assistance.

# 3.5.  Data collection

To address the two research questions, a questionnaire survey, two rounds of semi-structured interviews, chat logs, and WeChat moments were employed. The questionnaire and interview questions were designed in English.

# 3.5.1.  Questionnaire

To investigate learners’ attitudes toward WeChat-assisted CCK learning activities, a digital questionnaire (in Supplementary Appendix 3) was designed based on Jiang and Li (2018) and Xu and Peng (2017). Apart from learners’ demographic information, the questionnaire consisted of six statements marked with a five-point scale degree from ‘Strongly disagree’ (1) to ‘Strongly agree’ (5). The link to the questionnaire was sent to learners via WeChat at the end of the program. Learners were required to answer the questions as honestly as possible and submit the questionnaire online before 21:00 on May 23rd, 2019. 24 completed questionnaires were collected and kept anonymous.

# 3.5.2.  Interview

There were two rounds of interviews. For the first round, 24 students individually participated a face-to-face semi-structured interview held by the first author at the hotel hall on May 23rd. The interview began at 14:00, and lasted 15–20 minutes for each learner. For further information, a supplementary semi-structured interview was conducted online via WeChat in June, 2020 because the participants have gone back to their home countries. 16 students (8 with high levels and 8 with low levels) participated the online interview for the second round, with each lasting about 30 minutes. Three interview questions were designed with colloquial expressions. The initial version of the three IQs was drafted by the first researcher, and discussed between the first and second authors. Two senior academics in this field from the host university were invited to check the rationality of the IQs. The final three IQs were formed under their suggestions. IQ1 was to investigate learners’ attitudes, while IQ2 and IQ3 were to explore the information contributing to WeChat affordance analysis.

IQ1: Do you like WeChat and the WeChat task for Chinese cultural knowledge learning? Why?   
IQ2: To what extent WeChat is useful for you to learn Chinese cultural knowledge? IQ3: Would you continue to use WeChat for Chinese cultural knowledge learning after the program? Why?

# 3.5.3.  Chat logs and moments

Learners’ group and individual chat logs, as well as their WeChat moments were recorded and submitted to the first author by their NS partners in the form of screenshots. The conversation on chat logs, the turns of cultural discussions, and the comments on WeChat moments were all kept for data analysis.

# 3.6.  Data analysis

This study adopted mixed methods. The completed questionnaires were saved in the first author’s personal account on the website.2 Students’ answers in the questionnaires were analyzed by the research assistant through SPSS24 Win 64 system with a quantitative descriptive analysis.

The two rounds of interviews were recorded and transcribed into texts by the research assistant first, and double-checked by the instructor and the first author. For IQ1, data were coded by the research assistant with a keyword search method, for example, the words or expressions such as ‘like’ ‘useful’ and ‘good’ were coded into the category of perception. For IQ2 and IQ3, thematic analysis was applied and data were coded in a similar approach adapted from Strauss and Corbin (1990). The transcripts of interview answers were used as the initial memos for three stages of coding: open coding, axial coding, and selective coding (in Supplementary Appendix 4).

At the stage of open coding, 2/3 of the samples were chosen randomly and read repeatedly till the main idea was obtained. This stage consisted of coding with concept labeling, initial concepts and core concepts. The transcripts were labeled with $ { \mathbf { \^ { c } } } _ { \mathrm { P } } ,$ (Participant) and numbers, and extracted sentence by sentence into initial and core concepts. The initial concepts were derived from the original transcripts by retaining the body parts (main idea) of each sentence, but the core concepts were summarized with phrases in fewer words than the initial concepts. At the stage of axial coding, the core concepts were analyzed, compared, and classified into different categories. Using P1 as an example, all of the core concepts extracted from the transcripts of P1 were analyzed thematically and refined in meaning. Each meaning was a category, the category was taken to match the core concepts derived from the answers of the other students one by one. The matches under each category were put in column respectively. If the category of P1 could not match to the core concepts of interview answers by another student, a new category would be born, and the new category was used to match the rest of the core concepts till no new category was born. At the stage of selective coding, all the aforementioned categories from axial coding were filtered by their meanings. The categories with a shared meaning were selected, and put in a column of core category. Each core category was filled with an entry refined from axial coding categories. These entries were the affordances analyzed according to the learners’ answers in the interview.

The coding was conducted independently by the first author and the research assistant, while disputes were discussed together with the instructor until consensus was reached. The rest 1/3 of the samples were used for theoretical saturation test. The test result shows that no new concepts or categories occurred, thus the qualitative findings of the study were theoretically saturated. Pearson chi-square test was used to predict the frequency of each concept mentioned in the interview. The chat logs and comments were analyzed by calculating the turns of students’ online exchange and scrutinizing the highlights of excerpts.

# 4.  Results

# 4.1.  Learners’ attitudes

As shown in Table 3, for Statement 1, more than half of the learners (16/24) strongly agreed, and nearly one third (7/24) agreed, with the mean score standing at the highest $\mathbf { \ddot { M } } = 4 . 6 3$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 5 7 6 { \mathrm { , } }$ among the six statements. For Statement 2, parallel results (11/22) were reported in ‘Strongly agree’ and ‘Agree’, two learners chose neutral ${ } ^ { ( \mathrm { M } = 4 . 3 8 }$ , SD $= 0 . 6 4 7 \mathrm { \ : }$ ). As to the willingness, the majority (16/24) were willing to do WeChat activity, six learners (6/24) highlighted the degree of preference. For Statement 4, fourteen learners (14/24) strongly agreed and eight learners (8/24) agreed, with the mean score ranking at the second highest $\mathbf { \zeta } ^ { \mathrm { ' } } \mathbf { M } = 4 . 4 6$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 7 7 9 )$ ). For Statement 5, moderate attitudes were declared, six learners chose neutral, eight strongly agreed and nine agreed $\mathbf { \partial } \cdot \mathbf { M } = 4 . 0 0$ , $\mathrm { S D } \ = \ 0 . 8 8 5$ ). For Statement 6, ten learners strongly agreed, nine agreed, two disagreed, and three stayed neutral $( \mathrm { M } = 4 . 1 3$ , SD $\mathbf { \tau } = \mathbf { \epsilon } 0 . 9 4 7 $ ).

All of the mean values exceeded 4.00, indicating the learners’ positive attitudes, especially toward WeChat activity and interaction, which aligns with learners’ answers in the interview (in Table 4). For example, ‘The interaction is meaningful’ (P2, learnt Chinese for fifteen years), and ‘WeChat activity is interesting’ (P11, learnt Chinese for ten years). For the learner who seldom interacted on WeChat in spare time, she said ‘WeChat is good and useful’ (P14, learnt Chinese for one year). One beginner learner said ‘clear and so interesting’ (P19, learnt Chinese for one week). And another beginner learner answered ‘it is an impressive culture learning experience’ (P23, learnt Chinese for two years).

Notes: The keywords ‘方便, 有用, 好’ were recorded from answers by two learners who used both Chinese and English in the interview.

Despite overall support, potential differences cannot be neglected. As shown in Table 5, HL learners’ mean scores were higher than LL learners’ in terms of the degree of their agreement on the statements in the questionnaire. The results of HL learners $\left( \mathrm { M } > 4 \right)$ demonstrated their strong favor of WeChat in CCK learning, while LL learners were less positive, especially for Statement 5 and Statement 6. Vertically, apart from Statement 3, mean scores of the other five statements were unequal, but the gap of the first two statements was smaller than that of the last three. Huge inconsistency existed in Statement 5 and Statement 6 (D-value $> ~ 1$ ). The contrast shows that HL learners held a stronger willingness to keep and recommend the learning model.

# 4.2.  The affordances of WeChat perceived by learners of different Chinese levels

# 4.2.1.  For interaction and collaboration

The interview data show that WeChat afforded interaction and collaboration between learners and their partners, between learners and strangers, and between peers. First, the interaction between learners and partners could be commonly seen regardless of learners’ language levels. For example, one interviewee said ‘I really like the chatting atmosphere, and I feel relaxed while talking with my pa (partner), the more we talk, the more I am eager to know’ (P20, learnt Chinese for one week). Second, the off-campus resource collection activity offered most learners opportunities to communicate with local people they have never known before. For example, one student, although with a comparatively low language level, seemed to manage the conversation well by saying that

In the process of activity, I need to ask people from different walks of life every day, we soon become WeChat friends, though for most of the time, I have to use WeChat translating button to understand what they are talking about. (P5, learnt Chinese for one year and ten months)

Another LL student pointed out that she knew ‘how to break the silence’ (P14, learnt Chinese for one year). For learners with high speaking proficiency, they benefited from talking to the locals, including learning culture-embedded dialects such as ‘要得’ (pinyin: yaode, English meaning: OK or sure), which is to show acceptance in a friendly way, and ‘老师’ (pinyin: laoshi, English meaning: teacher), which is a friendly salutation in Chongqing, similar to ‘excuse me’ or ‘dear sir or madam’. As one HL learner said, ‘(They are) very different from the original English meaning, because this is not just a salutation, but also a way to show respect’ (P23, learnt Chinese for two years). Third, meaningful interactions were found between peers, for example, one learner from Thailand said that ‘We are learning in a complementary way, when I share my thoughts to them, I also learn from their reports’ (P10, learnt Chinese for one year).

$' 5 ^ { \prime }$ stands for Statement.

The affordance for interaction and collaboration was confirmed though, by comparing the answers of both groups (in Table 6), the mention frequency by LL learners was slightly lower than that by HL ones, especially in the interaction with local people. For example, two LL learners did not seem to be enjoyable. One learner was worried and said ‘it is a blur for me, I don’t know what is important information, what to record when going out’ (P21, learnt Chinese for one month), and the other declared ‘Sometimes I cannot understand the local jokes, it’s embarrassing to ask ‘what does it mean’ or ‘pardon’ every time, so I use stickers like ‘a litter boy with a pen and a question mark’ to show my confusion’ (P14, learnt Chinese for one year). In contrast, HL learners were more confident in building up a rapport with local people, as one of them said ‘It is never late to ask and discuss with whoever you can touch, that is the way to learn how to construct your own knowledge’ (P11, learnt Chinese for ten years). And another said ‘It is common to ask them the connotation of certain jokes and idioms, there’s nothing to do with your Chinese’ (P22, learnt Chinese for four years).

# 4.2.2.  For resource sharing

The interview data show that WeChat provided a platform for learners to share various resources including photos, videos, screenshots, music, cultural artifacts, in-class and off-campus contents, and so on. The resources under each topic were to some extent correlated, for example, when talking about food ‘Zhangfei beef, you know, it is not the beef that attracted me, but the story of Zhangfei, so many persons in Chinese history that I don’t know but I desire to know’ (P7, learnt Chinese for two years), the student seemed to be more interested in the background of a historical figure, as demonstrated in the following excerpts from pair interactions.

Table 6. Frequency of each affordance mentioned by the learners in the interview.   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan="4">Affordance</td><td rowspan="2"></td></tr><tr><td>Language level</td><td>Interaction and collaboration</td><td>Resource sharing</td><td>Knowledge internalization and construction</td><td>Sustainable learning and friendship maintaining</td></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>18</td><td>17</td><td>43</td><td>12</td><td>Total 90</td></tr><tr><td>Low</td><td>13</td><td>22</td><td>47</td><td>18</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>31</td><td>39</td><td>90</td><td>30</td><td>190</td></tr></table></body></html>

S: “Hi, pa, do you know Zhangfei, yesterday we bought the beef there?” “The facial makeup.”

(With a picture of facial makeup)

Pa: “Yeah, why?”

S: “so cool!”

Pa: “Haha, I just search it for you. Do you know why it’s called Zhangfei beef?”

S: “Absolutely, no!”

Pa: “It’s said that Zhangfei, Liubei, Guanyu, the famous figures in Three Kingdoms Period, they intended to make an oath to become brothers, Zhangfei asked the chef to cook the beef using Zhang’s recipe, he treated his brothers with the beef and wine, both Liu and Guan enjoyed it very much, ‘Zhangfei beef is so delicious’, they said. So, it became a famous brand later.”

S: “Who is Zhangfei, who are Liu and Guan? What is Three Kingdoms Period?”

(S: student, Pa: partner)

As indicated from the dialogue, the learner was proud while sharing with his peers, especially when others expressed curiosity on the contents shared. He also said

It’s like an exploration of something fresh and new, we were rushing to search it, and trying to be the first to share the fresh things. I can see my fellows were interested in the things I have shared, because they keep asking questions, with the questions, I know how to construct my writing task. (P7, learnt Chinese for two years)

Table 7 displays the rising momentum of learners’ discussion on cultural knowledge with resources shared via WeChat group or posted on WeChat moments. A turn means a continuous discussion on the same topic in a certain period. In comparison, HL learners moved faster than LL ones in the frequency of discussion, and used more diversified forms, for example, using photos, audios, videos, poems, articles, stickers, proverbs, and slogans, to resonate with peers. Several learners were so enthusiastic in sharing their daily experience that they posted ten bars of captioned pictures in one day. The rising trend in resource sharing was partly attributed to learners’ increasing learning interests, and the results presented in Tables 7 and 8 were interactively echoed to the rising trend, with degrees specific to learners respectively in language (HL: $\mathrm { M } = 4 . 5 8$ , LL: $\mathrm { M } = 3 . 6 7 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ) and CCK learning (HL: $\mathrm { M } = 4 . 6 7$ , LL: $\mathbf { M } = 3 . 9 2 \mathbf { \Gamma }$ ).

# 4.2.3.  For knowledge internalization and construction

Inspired by Chirico and Salvato (2016), knowledge internalization here refers to an individual’s behavior of assimilation of others’ (teachers’ and NSs’) cultural interpretations with the integration of personal experience, while construction means an individual’s new understanding of culture after internalization. Knowledge internalization is a deeper level of learning, and knowledge construction is developed on an internalized understanding of learning contents. From the interview results, WeChat afforded learners with a place to internalize their knowledge through various approaches such as peer sharing, news browse, and courseware reviewing, based on which learners were able to develop individual understandings.

It can be seen that the mean values (in Table 9) of CCK learning were comparatively high $\left( \mathrm { M } > 4 \right)$ . Among the items of cultural contents, ‘Local customs’ ranked first $( \mathrm { M } = 4 . 7 5 )$ ), followed by ‘Geography’ $\left( \mathrm { M } = 4 . 5 8 \right)$ . One student was impressed by ‘the unique terrain, I heard Chongqing has enjoyed the name of ‘the city of fog’ and ‘the city of mountain’’ (P18, learnt Chinese for one year). The score of ‘Lifestyles’ was moderately high $\mathbf { \chi } ^ { \prime } \mathbf { M } = 4 . 5 0 \rangle$ . As replied by a learner, ‘Every day is new to me, the rush hour in the morning, the spicy food, the square dancing everywhere…, people’s life there are so colorful’ (P22, learnt Chinese for four years). But the score of ‘Literature and art’ $( \mathrm { M } = 4 . 4 2 ) $ ) which occurred much more than the other topics in class schedule was slightly lower than that of the aforementioned items. One reason was mentioned, ‘Photographing, or recording are not allowed when visiting the library’ (P14, learnt Chinese for one year). Coincidently, the score of ‘Behaviors’ was equal to that of ‘Literature’, while ‘Knowledge in history’ ranked at the bottom $( \mathrm { M } = 4 . 2 5 )$ ).

In the interview, this affordance was mentioned with the highest frequency by the students (in Table 6). For instance, one LL learner compared WeChat to ‘a processing plant where the raw materials can be processed to finished products, which entails personal efforts’ (P20, learnt Chinese for one week). HL learners tended to view this learning experience as ‘a recreation’, one of them said ‘to learn in class is one thing, to take class experience into real life is one thing, but to combine classroom learning with real-life practice is another, so many thanks to this activity’ (P22, learnt Chinese for four years). For one of the highly fluent speakers, she regarded WeChat as ‘a perfect container, where the internalized cultural understanding could be saved and kept’, ‘the cultural report is like our own belongings, I mean, different from anyone else, it is our own creation on the cultural prototype’ (P2, learnt Chinese for fifteen years). Another one continued that ‘WeChat is a conveyor with which personal understanding on culture can be publicized’ (P11, learnt Chinese for ten years).

# 4.2.4.  For sustainable learning and friendship maintaining

As displayed in Table 3, most learners were willing to keep the learning model $( \mathbf { M } = 4 . 0 \dot { } \mathrm { \Omega }$ ) and recommend it to friends $( \mathrm { M } = 4 . 1 3 )$ ). The result shows that learners would sustain their CCK learning when they are deprived of Chinese cultural environment. The learners highlighted this point with their own reasons in the interview, for example, ‘WeChat provides a way for me to keep informed with the updates of the university’ (P10, learnt Chinese for one year), and ‘it costs nothing if you want to know more about the language’ (P6, learnt Chinese for one year). Some HL learners took WeChat for habitual use and learning. For example, ‘I have got used to use it every day, the moment I open my eyes, the first thing is to check WeChat message, shop on moments, read the news, and then get up to do my business’ (P1, learnt Chinese for eight years).

Apart from using WeChat for sustainable learning, learners also took WeChat as a medium to maintain friendship, for example, ‘WeChat is the only way for me to keep in touch with my Chinese friends’ (P14, learnt Chinese for one year). To maintain friendship was frequently stressed by learners from South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, and Laos. They implied that many friends in their country would use WeChat, and they might need to keep it in their social life. One student revealed that her Chinese boyfriend was studying at the host university, and they had to talk on WeChat when she left. The learner from America would not like to keep using WeChat by explaining that ‘There is a similar tool in my country and my friends seldom use WeChat, but I will use WeChat again when I come to China next time’ (P21, learnt Chinese for one month).

By referring to Statement 6 and Statement 7 in Table 5, the difference between HL and LL learners in their sustainable learning willingness (S5: D-value $= ~ 1 . 1 6$ , S6: D-value $= 1 . 0 9 $ ) was greater than that of the other statements (D-value $< 1$ ). With a retrospect of each item in Tables 5, 8, and 9, the gap between the two learner groups on this affordance was also bigger than that of the affordance for interaction and collaboration, and the affordance for knowledge internalization and construction. But the frequency of each affordance mentioned (in Table 6) did not illustrate a significant difference $\mathrm { ( P > 0 . 0 5 ) }$ between HL and LL learners. The results did not show an absolute relevance between leaners’ language levels and WeChat affordance.

# 5.  Discussion and implication

From an ecological and sociocultural perspective, affordance is the opportunity available to a learning activity (van Lier, 2004). MACL is mediated by the meaningful interaction between learners and environments, and affordance occurs when the environment resonates with learners’ capacities (Jin, 2018). Integrating WeChat in a China-based MACL program was found to be significant, for WeChat provided learners with different opportunities for learning CCK.

When investigating learners’ attitudes, most learners were positive and expressed their satisfaction and willingness to complete the three-stage activities, which echoes the findings of most studies (e.g. Huang, 2019; Jiang & Li, 2018; Jin, 2018; Wang, 2015; Xu & Peng, 2017). The finding implies that WeChat not only can but also should be integrated into CCK learning for learners regardless of their Chinese language levels. Learners’ positive attitudes are pivotal for teachers to carry out similar MACL activities. The willingness to learn would increase learners’ motivation and engagement, which, in turn, would help remain such learning enthusiasm in the long run. As to learners’ perceived affordances of WeChat in CCK learning program, it was found that WeChat afforded for interaction and collaboration, for resource sharing, for knowledge internalization and construction, and for sustainable learning and friendship maintaining. Akin to Chong and Reinders (2020), learners regardless of language levels may have a stronger sense of achievement when they were provided with so many affordances.

The affordance for interaction was frequently reported in MALL studies. For example, Jin’s (2018) findings mainly reflected the affordance for two learners’ communication with WeChat friends, Luo and Yang’s (2016) results proved the socializing affordance between classmates, and between students and friends. The current study goes beyond previous research in demonstrating WeChat affordance for both interaction and collaboration not only between learner peers, between learners and partners, but also between learners and strangers. That is to say, the worry raised by Jiang and Li (2018) that whether learners have confidence to approach a native speaker would be avoided if learners, deficient or proficient in speaking, take advantage of the affordance. Apart from that, the affordance for knowledge internalization and construction was mentioned with the highest frequency in the interviews, possibly because learners were fully authorized in completing the tasks, such real and self-service learning experience enabled an in-depth understanding of CCK. Knowledge construction was confirmed in Wu and Miller’s (2021) research in which students took an active part in asking questions and constructing dialogues about cultural taboos. As opposed to Huang’s (2019) findings, this affordance was proved to be effective to foster a high learner autonomy. Autonomous learners are intrinsically motivated (Godwin-Jones, 2019). Hence, for CCK education, the teacher should no longer be a language and cultural expert (Sung & Poole, 2017) trying to make corrections, but a witness of learners’ progress.

It should be noted that one of the two findings that distinguish this study from previous ones is the identification of the affordance for sustainable learning. The main reason of failure to find this affordance in previous cross-sectional studies may be the difficulty to monitor learners’ sustainable learning process because of the limits in time and space. Language challenges, academic challenges, and intercultural challenges also have an impact on learners’ initiative on sustainable learning (Yassin et  al., 2020). However, this study was part of a long-term program held annually, most learners participated out of personal interests, and re-participation was common for CCK learners, thus the barriers were reduced. In the meantime, the NS volunteers keeping contacting with the participants were students at the host university, they would follow up learners’ sustainable learning operationalization. To obtain sustainable learning is the representation of learning sustainability (Wang et  al., 2020; Yassin et  al., 2020). Learning sustainability is the focus of education sustainability under quality education. To ensure quality education and promote lifelong learning is one of the Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations, 2020). This highlights the importance of sustainable learning in improving learners’ specific knowledge such as CCK. Sustainable learning is necessary also because of the complexity and dynamism of Chinese culture. It implies that educators need to take special care in designing for sustainable mobile learning (Viberg et  al., 2021) within different learning contexts on the one hand, and on the other, help tackle the challenges students may encounter to improve learners’ learning sustainability.

The differences between HL and LL learners are the other distinctive finding. In scrutinizing the questionnaire results, the six statements won more supports from HL learners, partly because HL learners processed higher Chinese proficiency. With fewer communicating obstacles, HL learners felt easier in processing cultural resources, and were more confident while making cultural presentation. Besides language proficiency, other factors such as social influence (Fagan, 2019), self-efficacy (Wang & Sun, 2020), learning needs, pragmatic competence (Hamidi & Chavoshi, 2019), and so forth, may also exert a positive influence on learners’ learning experience. From a research perspective, the variables that may influence the attitudes toward MACL could be further extended in future studies. From a pedagogical perspective, given the different attitudes from learners with disparate language levels, instructors need to consider the factors affecting technology acceptance and explore more motivating activities catering to different learners in using MALL and MACL pedagogy. Some recommended scaffolding can be used for instructors to support LL learners for learning CCK, for instance, providing background information for each cultural site, giving timely feedback or explanation on learners’ inquiries, providing more online learning resource access, and pairing HL English language learners with LL Chinese language learners for better communication.

By examining the turns of discussion on chat logs, WeChat moments, and the mention frequency of each affordance, disparity occurred between the two learner groups on the affordance for resource sharing and sustainable learning. HL learners showed a higher frequency in taking advantage of the two affordances. However, the frequency of each affordance mentioned in the interview revealed no significant difference between

HL and LL learners, possibly because the second round of interview was conducted after the students went back, and their sustainable learning practice may be different from their predictions prior to act. For this reason, the differences reflected in the questionnaire results may be more convincing. As explained by Tong and Tsung (2018), HL learners were much more proactive in sharing resources with more diversified forms, and were much more likely to maintain WeChat use in CCK learning after the China-based exchange program, because the real-life scenarios afford rich language connotations to HL learners, but sporadic language chunks to LL ones (Jin, 2018). In this study, HL leaners tended to resonate more with the learning resources in the environment. It sheds light on the assumption that mobile affordance may be interrelated with learners’ language proficiency, thus teachers’ appropriate interventions are necessary to encourage LL learners to share learning resources and invest more efforts in autonomous MALL and MACL practice.

# 6.  Conclusion

This study explores learners’ attitudes and the affordances of WeChat perceived by HL and LL learners for learning CCK. Combining the data from questionnaires, chat logs, moments, and semi-structured interviews, it can be seen that, first, most learners held unequivocally positive attitudes toward WeChat activities, and second, WeChat afforded learners with opportunities for interaction and collaboration, for resource sharing, for knowledge internalization and construction, and for sustainable learning and friendship maintaining, among which the affordance for knowledge internalization and construction was mentioned with the highest frequency in the interview. This study goes beyond previous MALL research mainly in two aspects. One is the identification of the affordance for sustainable learning. To obtain sustainable learning plays a significant role in CCK acquisition, especially when learners are deprived of real learning environments. The other is the finding on the differences between HL and LL learners. By comparing the two learner groups, the activities won more supports from HL learners, and their frequency in leveraging the affordance for resource sharing and sustainable learning was higher. From a theoretical and analytical perspective, affordance can be used as a construct being explored with an integration of various mobile devices. From a pedagogical perspective, this study verifies the potential of mobile technologies for educators to conduct language and culture learning activities.

This study is not without limitations. Because of the limited number and insufficient background information of the learners, for example, for those who never used WeChat before the program, it is not known whether they habitually used other mobile tools for learning, thus the results need to be tested among a larger population, and researchers need to take a comprehensive background check of the subjects beforehand. Apart from that, the mobile affordances for learning CCK were subjectively presented by the participants, and the researchers failed to compare learners using WeChat with a control group who do not use WeChat.

Given the differences between HL and LL learners, researchers can further explore the affordances of mobile technologies perceived by learners with disparate language levels for different learning purposes. With the innovation of mobile technologies, and increased significance of sustainable learning, future study on how to carry out sustainable M-learning is recommended.
