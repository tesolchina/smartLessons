Lecturers' abilities to use semiotic resources to construct meaning and to create engagement play an important role in university classrooms where English is the medium of instruction (EMI). The main focus of this study is on how EMI lecturers enrolled in a professional development program use semiotic and interpersonal resources to engage students through pair work activities. Two analyses were conducted on a dataset of twelve micro-teaching sessions extracted from an EMI teacher training corpus. The first analysis identified the moves and pedagogical functions lecturers instantiated while carrying out engagement episodes (EEs). The findings of this analysis served to design the \*Pair work engagement episodes framework", which includes five basic moves: 1) contextualizing, 2) setting up, 3) monitoring, 4) eliciting, and 5) summarizing. The second analysis illustrated how the pedagogical functions found in each move of four EEs were constructed multimodally through verbal and non-verbal communicative modes (i.e., spoken, written, non-verbal materials, space, and posture). The pair work EEs framework and the multimodal analysis lend support to strategies that may be implemented in EMI professional development programs to enhance lecturers' multimodal interactional competence.

# 1. Introduction

Most lecturers would agree that effective teaching involves knowing \*what" and how' to communicate. While the what refers to the disciplinary content, the how takes into account the abilit to use semiotic and interpersonal resources to convey meaning Morel, 2015). In all clasrooms, lecturers may express this knowledge through different degrees of multimodal and interactive discourse It has been sugested that becoming aware of a varied use of semiotic resources (e.g., Kres, 2010; Norte, 2016, 2018; Ruiz-Madrid & Fortanet-Gomez, 2019) together with interactive discourse (e.g., Suvinity, 2012; Walsh, 2011) may be beneficial to promote classrom engagement (e.g., Forey & Feng, 2016; Morell et al., 2020; Querol-Julian, 2021a, 2021b). This is especially true in English-medium instruction (EMI) contexts, where there is "an increased risk of disturbance in communication'" (Bjorkman, 2011, p. 196). Due to the nature of these settings, multimodal competence .., lecturers' eficient use of semiotic resources, becomes highly relevant (Heberle, 2010) to construct and represent meaning for students who may lack sufficient inguisic competence. Similarly, interactional competence ..,tachers and leners abilit to use interaction as a oo for medating and asssting lening (Walsh, 2011, p. 158) is needed to promote collaboratie classoom discourse (Morel, 2018) that allows for L2 students exposure to and engagement in meaningful interactions (Hsu, 2015).

The current study focuses on how EMI lecturers taking a professional development program use semiotic and interpersonal resources to engage students through pair work activities. Much like in previous studies, for instance those included in Morell & Vol. chenkova, 2021 and Sanchez-Perez, 2020, this research aims to address what to include in professonal development programs, but in this case from a multimodal perspective.

A study of the literature on EMI in higher education reveals that institutions have not come to aconsensus on the standardization of EMI lecturer training, such as course content and structure or participants language proficiency requirements (Costa, 2015; Jimenez-Munoz, 2020). Concerning content, multimodality and classroom interaction have both been suggested as beneficial components of such professional development programs (Ball & Lindsay, 2013; Gay et al., 2020; Jimenez-Munoz, 2020; Llinares & Mendikoetxea, 2020). Nevertheless, EMI teacher training programs, such as the Plan DOing" at the Autonomous University of Madrid, cover interactional competence (Llinares & Mendikoetxea, 2020) and others, for example the \*Prof-teaching" teaching program at the University of Alicante, deal with both multimodal and interactional competences (Morell et al., 2022).

The inclusion of multimodal and interactional competences within EMI teacher training can be supported by Systemic Functional Multimodal Discourse Analysis (SF-MDA)(e., OHallran, 2004). This approach sees to understand and describe the organization of semiotic resources and their functions to analyze the meanings that emerge from multimodal choices (Jewitt t l., 2016; Lim, 2021). Outcomes of SF-MDA analyses can help to decide what aspects of these competences may be included in training. As Kresset al. (201, p. 18) claimed,

this meaning-making resides in the combined efects of the orchestration of the modes by the producer and by the reproducer, in the interaction between what is said, what s shown, the posture adopted, the movements made, and the position of the speaker and the audience relative to each other in the interaction.

In the case of lecturers attempting to promote pair work activities, special emphasis should be placed on the combination of the semiotic resources they orchestrate. In terms of Systmic Functional Lingustics (SFL), the orchestration of modes is determined by the content (i.e., ideational metafunction), how it is presented (i.e., textual metaunction), and the content-audience relationship (i. interpersonal metafunction). In thecassroom, this entail lcturers orchestration of spoken, written, non-verbal material (NMs) (e 8, graphs, tabes, mages, realia), and body language modes, which are necessary to transmit and organize disciplinary content andto interact with students. Fig. 1 represents a SF-MDA framework for classroom interaction (adapted from Morell, 2015), which includes.

- three basic classroom components: the lecturer, the students, and the topic;   
- classroom semiotic resources: spoken, written, NVMs and body language modes; and.   
- three metafunctions of communication: ideational (content), textual (organization) and interpersonal (engagement).

As is commonly known, the three main components of any lecture are the lecturer, the students and the topic. Nevertheles, it is the lecturer who decides how to represent meaning and especiall how to establish interpersonal relationships. The latter -the focus of this study-is fundamental to promote interaction and engagement, and it becomes particularly relevant for EMI contexts where students and lecturers may have problems in verbal communication. Interaction in contexts where English is used as alingua franca is eential for effective lcturing since it helps students to proces content (Kaassen, 2001; Querol-Julian, 2021b). In fact, some studie (e., Suvinitty, 2012) indicate that a higher degree of interaction wil facilitate students understanding, regardessof the language of instruction. In line with this, interactive lecturing also sems to provide rich opportunities for both lecturers and students to make use of pragmatic strategies (Bjorkman, 2011) such as questions, negotiation of meaning and elicitations to deal with content and language. These pragmatic strategies characterize engagement episodes (EEs), which are \*the instances within the interactive lecture in which students are involved in pair work, group work, debates, games or web-based activities" (Morell et al., 2020, p. 309).

Fig. 1. SF-MDA framework for classroom interaction.

This study first atempts to identify and describe the moves lecturers may instantiate in pair work EEs. Moves are understood here as \*rhetorical units that perform a coherent communicative function in a written or spoken discourse" (Swales, 2004, pp.228-229) Then, these moves are analyzed to determine the pedagogical functions lecturers may follow to engage students. The dataset is taken from the AcqUA EMI micro-teaching corpus derived from the \*Prof-Teaching" professional development program at the University of Alicante (UA) (Morell et al., 2022). The research questions that guided this study are as follows:

RQ1: What moves and pedagogical functions are instantiated in pair work activities by EMI lecturers in the Prof-teaching training   
course?   
RQ2: How are these pedagogical functions constructed multimodally by these EMI lecturers?

# 2. Methodology

# 2.1. Context

This study draws on the EMI Prof-teaching teacher training workhops held at the UA (Morell e al., 202). These workshops have been implemented to meet the communicative and pedagogical needs of ecturers from diverse disciplines who are faced with EMI teaching. Among the contents of the second of the three program modules, named \*EMI-Reflections, Awareness and Practice (EMI-RAP), is a special focus on multimodal and interactional competences, which has proven to be beneficial for lecturers' per. formances (Morell et l., 2020). As a final proect of the "Prof-teaching" second module, trainees are asked to put into practice what they have learned (e.g., multimodal and interactive strategies) and to prepare an engaging subject-specific mini-lesson $\mathrm { 1 0 { - } 2 0 \ m i n } )$ This mini-lesson should be simplified so that participants from divers disciplines may not only understand the content, but also be able to take part in the pair work EEs. t is important to point out that the trainees were encouraged to enhance pair work activitie, but were not given any explicit instructions on how to go about it.

The participants of these workshops come from the university's seven faculties, namely Economics & Business (EcO), Education (EDU), Humanities & Arts (HUA), Law (LAW), Science (SCI), Health Science (HSC), and the Polytechnic Schol (PSC).For the purposes of this stud, the disciplines of thse facties hve ben catgorizd thr as Soci Scienes (i., CO, DU, UA, LAW) or Tchnical

Sciences (i.., SCI, HSC, SC). The participants' micro-teaching sessions are video recorded and compiled into the continuously developing AcqUA EMI Micro-teaching corpus. To date the corpus contains over 120 video-recorded sessions.

# 2.2. Dataset

The dataset consists of 12 video recorded EEs that were selected from among 45 of the most recently recorded micro-teaching sessions extracted from the AcqUA EMI corpus. The 12 EEs were taken from six Social Science (SS) and six Technical Science (TS) micro-teaching sessions. These Es were chosen because they involved lecturers enhancement of students pair work activities, which is the object of study in this paper. They served to identify what moves and pedagogical functions EMI lecturers instantiated to foster students' engagement Then, four of these 12 EEs -SS1, S3, TS3 and TS6- (highlighted in bold in Table 1) were selected to describe how lecturers constructed these pedagogical functions multimodally. The choice of these four Es was due to the variety of semiotic resources (e.g., spoken and writen language, NVMs, kinesics and proxemics) trainees used throughout the EEs. Table 1 describes the EMI workshop participants' background (i.e., proficiency level, experience in higher education and EMI), the micro-teaching topic, and the length of the pair work EEs.

As shown above, the 12 EMI micro-teaching sessons represent a range of disciplines from three of the universtyss Facultie (i., Economics aw, Humanities) and three of the universty's TS Faculties (i.e., Polytechnic School, Sience, and Health Science). The participants' English language competence as attested by fficial certification (e.g., Cambridge exams) is between a B2 (upper-intermediate) and C2 (proficiency) level according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. Their teaching experience in higher education ranges from 1 to more than 20 years, with a median of aproximately 10 years. Four lectrers indicated that they had prior experience in teaching in EMI contexts, while the remaining did not. The EEs ranged from $4 ^ { \prime } 4 1 ^ { \prime \prime }$ minutes to $1 2 ^ { \prime } 4 9 ^ { \prime \prime }$ minutes. The varying lengths of the episodes depended on the time needed to contextualize the topic.

# 2.3. Data analysis

The study consists of two parts. The first is the macroanalysis of the moves and pedagogical functions lecturers instantiated to promote students engagement in12 pair work EEs, whereas the second is the multimodal microanalysis f four of them. To carry out a systematic analysis of the data and to ensure intercoder reliability the three researchers worked together in the macroanalysis and microanalysis.

In the first part, the 12 micro-teaching sessons were carefully watched to identify the pair work EEs (See Table 1). Then, the selected Es were transcribed and examined to determine the moves and pedagogical functions the lecturers performed. The macroanalysis was done to discern which moves lecturers used to carry out pair work activities, and if they coincided with those in Morell (2018) (i.e., setting up, supervising, and eliciting).

Fig. 2. ELAN template.

In the second part, the microanalysis, we followed a SF-MDA (O'Halloran, 2004) approach to describe how these pedagogical functions were constructed multimodally. For this purpose four micr-teaching sessions were selected to illstrate how lecturers performed the different pedagogical functions using verbal and non-verbal communicative modes. This analysis was supported by the multimodal annotation software ELAN (Wittenburg et al., 2006). The microanalysis of the moves and the pedagogical functions explored spoken and written language, non-verbal materials (NvMs), kineis (posture) and proxemics (spatial position). Fig. 2 is an ELAN screnshot of Ts3 (Perception in architecture) that llustrates the transcription of the discourse at a specific moment and the corresponding annotations found in the 9 tiers (i.e, episode, moves, pedagogical functions, teacher's talk, student's talk, written-material screen, non-verbal material, posture, and spatial position).

In the results section, Tables 5-8 represent the anotated data obtained with ELAN for each of the four Es. These tables include the move and pedagogical functions as well asthe modes (spoken, written, NMs and body language) orchestrated. Concerning the spoken mode, a selection of the speakers' keywords and expressions that clearly reresented the edagogical functions were annotated. For the written mode, the words and phrases found on the slide and board were shown through screenshots. NVMs (i.e., images and realia) were also represented through screenshots. To have a general impressin of the role of proxemics, i.e, use f space, and kinesc, i.e, body movements, we focused on lecturers positions in the classoom and their posture when performing the pedagogical functions. In terms of ecturers' use of space, we distinguished two main positions: the authoritative space -in front of the room in control of all students- and the interactive space -near groups of students to promote interaction (Lim et al., 2012). Regarding lecturers' posture in the classroom, two categories were established: dynamic -in movement- and static -still.

# 3. Results

# 3.1. Identification of the moves and pedagogical functions in pair work engagement episodes

Having carefully examined each of the pair work EEs of the 12 micro-teaching sessions, it appeared that they had followed five moves, namely contextualizing, setting up, monitoring, eliciting and summarizing (See Table 2).

Much like in Morell (2018), the lecturers set up, monitored (or supervised), and elicited. In the current study, the term \*super vising" is renamed \*monitoring". The atter is understod as it i used at lower educational levels, where teachers actively supervise, provide fedback, praise and prompt individuals or groups while carrying out activities (Doyle, 2006; Evertson & Emmer, 2012). In addition to the setting up, monitoring, and eliciting moves, the results of this study indicate that there are two other moves, namely contextualizing and summarizing. This is due to having explored more Es and broadening the scope of the analysis by taking note of What the lecturers did before the setting-up and after the eliciting moves. The findings reveal that lecturer sem to activate students background knowledge, raise their awareness and/or familiarize them with a new concept before setting up the activity. In doing so, lecturers can situat students in the context of the activity and begin to involve them. After completing the activit, the summary move serves to recapitulate, reinforce, and build new knowledge. Another finding is the identification of at least three optional pedagogical functions within each move. Fig. 3 shows the moves and pedagogical functions in pair work EEs.

At the start of the Es, lecturers contextualized the topic for the activity by activating background knowledge, and/or raising awareness, and/or familiarizing with the concept. Lecturers could decide on using one, two or three of these pedagogical functions depending on their particular intentions. Then, in the seting up move, letrer stalished theojective and gave instructions, but not necessarily in the same order. In addition, some lecturers appeared to encourage students to participate in this move, as wellas in others. This may be a result of having ben taught the benefits of active learning, language usage and critical thinking throughout the EMI workshop.

Once the participants had started to work in pairs, the lecturers monitored each by approaching and supervising them or participating in thir discussions. That i, some lecturers only supervised the classroom activit, whereas thers intervened to support students or in response to their requests. The former provides students with the opportunity to work autonomously, while the latter allows lecturers to enhance students comprehension and progres. These interventions, itiated by the lectrers or students, involved negotiation of meaning (Morell, 2004), in which the students, for example, requested clarification or the lecturers checked comprehension (Morell 2020). Moreover, in some cases, lecturers provided scaffolding (Vygotsky, 1978) to best support and encourage students to achieve the pedagogical goals (Gibbons, 2002). After monitoring the students, the lecturers began the eliciting move by either checking f the pairs had completed the activit or requesting them to finish. Then, they proceeded to gather contributions from students and, in some cases, give feedack. The fact that some lectrers did not giv feedback and that others simply smile or nodded made us decide not to categorize giving fedback as a separate move. In the summarizing move lecturers drew on student contri butions to identify and paraphrase key points. In this final move, these two pedagogical functions were instantiated at times by means of oral repetition and/or written synthesis of students contributions on the board. Occasionally, ecturers also showed a previously prepared summary slide.In addition, some lecturers chose to go a step further and helped students make connections between their pair work outcomes and the pedagogical objectives.

Fig. 3. Pair work engagement episodes framework.

The model of the moves and pedagogical functions (Fig. 3) represents a prototypical lecturers performance of a pair work EE as attested in this study. It sems that if lecturers follow through with the five moves (i.e., contextualizing, setig up, monitoring, eliciting, and summarizing), as was the case in our dataset, they may have a beter chance of engaging students in the task. Nevertheless, as explained above, it may be asumed that lecturers do not necessarily implement al five moves or each of the pedagogical functions contained within them.

The examination of the moves and pedagogical functions of the 12 pair work EEs also permited the identification of how lecturers performed them linguisically. Table 3 provides examples of lecturers' utterances during the specific moves and their pedagogical functions.

# 3.2. Multimodal construction of the moves and pedagogical functions in pair work engagement episodes

The multimodal analysi of the four pair work Es (Table 4) was carried out to exemplify how the lecturers instantiated the moves and performed the pedagogical functions drawing on verbal and non-verbal modes of communication. Specifically, we looked at the lecturers' spoken mode, written mode i., on board or screen), use of NMs (i.e., images and realia), space (i.e., authoritative or interactive), and posture (dynamic or static). In the case of the written mode and the NMs, lecturers' original slides and ilustrations have been maintained. For this purpose, we chose two of the s (SS1 and S3) and two of the TS (TS3 and TS6) micro-teaching sessions because they implemented clear examples of the pedagogical functions within the five moves. The selected lecturers did not have any experience in EMI teaching, but they had taught at universty for over three years. In the next two sections, the lecturers' multimodal performances in theselected pair work EEs (3.2.1.) will be described, and then the common characteristics found in each of the moves will be discussed (3.2.2.).

# 3.2.1. The multimodal performances in the EEs

The following descriptions (1-4) provide an overview of the two Social Science (S1 and ss3) and the two Technical Science (TS3 and Ts6) lecturers' multimodal performances while instantiating each of the moves.

Description 1: ss1 What's an environmentl tax?. The objective of this micro-teaching session (Table5) was to explain what is meant by environmental taxation. For this purpose, the lecturer, who started in the authoritative space, not only defined the topic but also represented it on the scree through a written definition and an accompanying image of a factory emitting smog. This seems to have been done to raise students' awareness regarding the impact of environmental taxation on society as wel as to introduce a new concept. As she proceeded to set up the activity, she continued in the authoritative space and told the pairs f students that they hould decide whether or not their given presumed environmental tax fitte in with the previously presented definition. These instructions were not only spoken (I want you to discuss f these taxes fit or not in the definition we have studied before"), but also wrien on the screen so as to reinforce the purpose of the task. Following this, she verball encouraged them to complete the task and entered the interactive space to negotiate meaning with them (At first glance, what do you say?"). Having approached each of the pairs, the lecturer returned to her original space (authoritative) to begin the eliciting move by informing them that time was up. As she gathered their contributions, she provided them with feedback (Yes!, "Exactly!) and simultaneously showed the types of environmental taxations written in red on the screen (perfect, imperfect, and false). Drawing on students' contributions and on the keywords presented on the slide, the lecturer identified the main points and elaborated on them to construct knowledge.

Description 2: ss3 The concept of contract. This engagement episode (EE) aimed to make students aware of the four elements that are necessary for a contrct to exist (Table 6). It was contextualized through the previous episode where the participants were encouraged to think of examples of contracts they had recently made. Then, from the authoritative pace she briefl activated their background knowledge by referring to a previously explained sequence of a contract. Immediately afer, she set up the activity by establishing the objective of the task (to find out the four elements needed for a contract to exist) and told students to work in pairs for $2 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ . These instructions wre aso onthesceen. In adtio, she rovidd licittion les such as Think about .. wan tobuy .. I or He wants to sell. ., which would allow them to come up with the four elements of a contract. This move was followed by the monitoring of the activity, where she moved around the room in the interactive space, paying attention to all pairs and scaffolding by asking them specific questions to trigger their contract schema. Then, back in the authoritative space, she checked completion and started to gather students' responses. As she encouraged each of the pairs to answer, she approached them, returned to the board to write their re. sponses, and finally gave fedback. To conclude the , she reviewed each of the elements of a contract, which appeared in red one by one on a slide. In so doing, she built knowledge and prepared students for the subsequent activity, which involved defining the term 'contract'.

Description 3: TS3 perception in archtcture. In this micro-teaching session (Table 7 below) the lecturer aimed to raise participants awarenes of peretions in architectre, partularly about the effc scific buldigs had had on the participants. While stadng at the front (athritative space), ner the screen, and addresin the audience th leturer both conxtualied and set up the activity. To contextualize this episode of engagement, the lecturer attempted to activate the students background knowledge by referrng to how architecture could evoke certain emotions. This was done by stating \*perception is the quality of architecture that is capable to (sic) connect with people's emotions'. Moreover, she provided examples of specific emotions related to architecture (raise awareness) Then, she showed and read a quotation projected on the screen about how architecture may be perceived so as to introduce a new concept. In the setting up move, the lecturer asked students to give an example of a building that had had an effect on them. These instructions were visually represented on the scren. As she explained what the examples should entail, she moved back and forth. Then, shetold them to work in pairs and approached each of them to monitor their discussion by means of negotiation of meaning and scaffolding. Once she had interacted withall the pairs, she asked, have you finished?" and then proceeded to request volunteers to give examples of buldings. Whil they were giving their examples, the lecturr approached each of the pair, and positively reinforced them with ok", "yes, or perfect In ddition, she wrote the types of buildings and their influencing characteristics on the board. The students contributions, which had been written on the board, served as a summar f the key points discussed. In this case, instead of following the usual summarizing move, the lecturer shared her own experience, thus making a connection between the students contribution and her own.

Description 4: TS6 The principles of dynamics. In this engagement episode, the lecturer aimed to review the principles of dynamics (Table 8). While standing in the authoritative space, he contextualized the pair work activity by showing a cartoon picture of Newton, Who was twittering while apples were falling on his head. Then, the lecturer asked, \*who i this guy? This served to connect the topic with present day students and established rapport with them. Then, he proceededto inquire if anyone knew the principles of dynamics and dropped a notebook on the flor not only to catch ther atention, but also to exemplify what these principles involved. To set up the activity, he divided the group into pairs by approaching them and calling out their names. They were asked to answer the questions that he verbalized and were projected on the slide (Do you remember the principles of dynamics? How many are there? Could you tell (sic) any of them?). As the participants were discussing possible responses he came closer and intervened to scaffold (Be careful, the principles of ynamics not their physical magnitudes") and negotiated meaning with them (S: I don't know what is dynamics (sic) T: The explanation of why thins move the way they move). After a minute he clld on the different pairs o elicit their answers, and then he collected the three correct responses on the board (principle of inertia, action/reaction and $\mathbf { F } = \mathbf { m } \mathbf { a } )$ , and subsequently, summarized by showing them on the screen. In addition, he recapitulated the content discussed throughout the engagement episode to prepare them to construct new knowledge.

# 3.2.2. Common characteristics in the multimodal performances

Having multimodally analyzed the four pair work EEs, we now proceed to compare the lecturers' multimodal performances to determine what may be considered common characterisics in each of the moves. This comparison of what the lecturers did allowed us to observe how they orchestrated semiotic resources to create the moves and to carry out the pedagogical functions. What fllows is a systematic decription of the multimodal ensembles found in the data. First it takes into account the pedagogical functions, then the spoken and written modes, the NVMs and finally the lecturers' use of space and posture in each of the moves.

Contextualizing. Each of the three pedagogical functions of the contextualizing move, i., activating background knowledge, raising awareness, and familiarizing with new concepts, was found in at last one of the four episodes examined. In all cases, lecturers orchestrated spoken, written and body language modes. Three lecturers activated background knowledge by making a request (TS3), asking a display question, (i.e, a question to check knowledge) (Ts6), and by uttering an expository statement (SS1 and TS3). Two lecturers raised awareness by means of an expository statement (Ss1) and an expert's perspective (T3). Only one lecturer introduced a new concept through an expository statement (S3). In addition, in the wrtten mode, some lecturers purposely highlighted keywords on slides. Two lecturers (i.., S1 and TS6) were found to make use of NVMs, specifically a book and images projected on the sides. In terms of posture, the four lecturers were dynamic in the authoritative space while contextualizing the topic.

Sttin-up. In this move, the four lecturers implemented the three pedagogical functions, i.e., establishing objectives, giving in. structions, and encouraging. As in the previous move, the lecturers combined spoken, written and body language modes. The spoken mode was used to establish the objectives. For this purpose, requests (SS1 and TS3), an expository statement (ss3), and a display question (TS6) were used. Instructions were given in all cases by means of requests. The lecturers encouraged students to participate through a referential question (i.e, a real question related to experiece) (ss1), clues (S3 and T3), and by praising (S6). NM was used by S1 in giving instructions and encouraging moves. Whil explaining what to do, SS1 provided students with index cards with some examples related to the topic. Inaddition, even though she was projecting the activity on the slide, she was asked by the students

to change it to show the slide containing the definition needed for the activity. While giving instructions, it appears that the four lecturers were conscious of the need to ascertain that the students clearly understood the instructions; thus, they not only verbalized them but aso had them written on slides. While some lecturers showed the instructions for the activit (Ss1 and s3), others included referential (S3 and S6) and display (TS6) questions to be answered. Instructions for pair dynamics were also added on slides by three lecturers (Ss1, s3 and TS6). Regarding space and posture, data showed that whil stating objectives the four lecturers were in the authoritative space, whereas when encouraging they were in the interactive space. Nevertheles, when giving instructions two lec turers (i.., S1 and s3) remained in the authoritative space, whereas two others (i.e., TS3 and TS3) were in the interactive space. In all cases, the lecturers were dynamic throughout the move.

Monitoring. During the monitoring move, the four lecturers entered the pair discussions by either negotiating meaning (s1) or scaffolding (S3), or both (T3 and Ts6). In this move, as in the others, the lecturers employed spoken, written, and body language modes. NVM was only used by SS1. The remaining lecturers ket using slides to present the same information as in the stting up move. Regarding the spoken mode, those lecturers who negotiated meaning asked display questions, comprehension checks and confirmation checks, while those who scaffolded included responses to students' questions along with follow-up elicitation questions, and guidance. Due to the nature of the monitoring move, the lecturers were dynamic within the interactive space to approach each of the pairs.

Elicitig. In the eliciting move, the three possible pedagogical functions, i.e, checking completions, gathering contributions, and giving feedback, were instantiated by the four lecturers. In this move, the lecturers also orchestrated spoken, written, and body language modes. To check completion, lecturers used either requests (SS1 and TS6) or polar questions (SS3 and TS3). Then, while gathering contributions, thre lecturers (s1, s3 and TS6) overtly approached each of the pairs and encouraged them to share their responses, and one lecturer asked for volunteer (TS3). The lecturers mostly provided feedback that reinforced them positively. In regard to the witen mode, thre lecturer (ss3, TS3 and TS6) progressively collected students contributions on the board, while the initial prompts for the activitie remained projected. In contrast, one lecturer did not collect students' contributions but gradually presented a previously prepared slide containing a list of highlighted key points. Concerning posture, all the lecturers were dynamic and stood in the authoritative space when checking completion of the activity and gathering contributions. However, when giving feedback, two remained in the authoritative space (sS1 and TS3) and two in the interactive space (sS3 and TS6).

Summarizing. In the last move, the pedagogical unction of building knowledge was instantiated by allecturers. Nevertheles, two also identified key point, and another paraphrased. As in all the previous moves, the lecturers aso relied on the spoken mode, written mode and body language to construct meaning. The four lecturers spoke to build knowledge by reviewing what the students had

learned through the pair activity and by making a connection with the forthcoming activity (Ss1 and Ts3). To identify key points, two lecturers (Ss1 and S6) restated what had been discussed whil gathering students' contributions. Similarly toparaphrase, one of the lecturers (TS6) drew on students answers to devise a wellstructured and combined response. In the case of the written mode, all the lecturers highlighted words to emphasize key points and three f them (Ss1, sS3 and Ts6) included a final overview of the topic addressed. NVMs were used by two lectures, S3 and TS3; the former used a diagram with key points, and the lattr projected an image to share her own example. inall, with respect to pace and posture, the four lecturers remained in the authoritative space and were dynamic.

# 4. Discussion

In the study, we attempted to identify the moves lecturers instantiate when carrying out pair work engagement episodes and the possible pedagogical functions that may emerge from them. In addition, we explored the ways in which lecturers implemented these pedagogical functions from a multimodal perspective.

The first analysis allowed us to devise a prototypical and adaptable framework for the construction of pair work episodes. This model consists of five moves, namely: 1) contextualizing, 2) seting up, 3) monitoring, 4) eliciting, and 5) summarizing. For each of these moves, we found that depending on lecturers aims they can select from several pedagogical functions to promote participants engagement in pair work. Data revealed that in the contextualization move, lecturersactivated students' background knowledge and/ or raised their awarenes and/or familiarized them with new concept. The setting up move consisted of etablishing objectives, giving instructions and posibly encouraging. The monitoring move involved supervision with or without verbal interactions to negotiate meaning and/or to scaffold. In theelcitation move, allecturers either requested the pairs to finish or checked if they had), gathered their contributions, and in some cases gave fedback. Finall, in the summarizing move, lecturers synthesized key points or paraphrased, or chose to go a step further and build knowledge.

The second analysis was conducted to explore how lecturers used and combined communicative modes in pair work engagement episodes to perform these pedagogical functions. For this purpose, a multimodal discourse analysi f four lecturers' use of spoken, written, NVMs, space and posture was carried out. In the five moves they were constantly moving and making use of all modes except for NVMs, which were implemented only ocasionall. It was found that an interemiotic relationship (Jewit et l., 2016) exists between the spoken and written modes i each of the moves. The only exception was the monitoring move where the spoken mode, use of space, and posture were foregrounded. In general terms, our findings describe how modes may be combined within each of the moves.

In the contextualization move, the spoken and written modes are orchestrated tocapture the audiences attention and engage them in the proceeding activity. To activate background knowledge and/or raise awareness the lecturers asked audience-oriented questions, made requests and presented statements or professional views about a topic. These spoken strategies were reinforced by the written words on slides, which were at times highlighted in colors. NVMs served as llustratie or expository tols (Morel, 2015) to either support spoken and writte information or stimulate the co-construction of discourse betwen the lecturer and students. During the contextualizing move, ecturers occupied the authoritative space (Lim et al., 2012) to take control of the lecture and to attract the audience's attention.

In the setting up move, both the spoken and written modes took on a crucial role to assure that students undersood objectives and

instructions for the activitie. However, when encouraging students to participate, thespoken mode prevailed. I terms of kinesics and proxemics, lecturers tended to remain in the authoritative position when establishing the objectives, whereas some progressvely moved to the interactive space to give instructions and encourage students. This transition from the authoritative to the interactive space corresponds with the shift from the teacher-fronted to the learner-centered classroom set up (Ball & Lindsay, 2013), which increases throughout the following move.

The monitoring move takes place entirely in the interactive space and entails mostly poken discourse to best facilitate students comprehension and completion of theactivity. It i during this move that students truly work together, and lecturer can suport them by negotiating meaning and scafolding. During this time, lecturers relegate power to students, who adopt acentral role by engaging in thinking-based learning and assuming more responsibilit in peer and lecturer interactions. These interactions may be considered a mediational tool toassist students earning (Walsh, 2011), shown to be necessary especiall in EMI contexts (e.g., Bjorkman, 2010; 2011) where students need support both in language and content (Airey, 2011; Hellekjaer, 2010; Suvinitty, 2012).

In the elcitation move, speech and writing on the board are found to prevail over the other modes. The combination of these two modes is observed in the pedagogical function of gathering contributions since lecturers not only engage students in interaction but also used the board to note down their responses. In contrast, the spoken mode islient in the pedagogical functions of checking completion and giving feedback to provide positive reinforcement. Regarding the use of space, most lecturers stay in the authoritative position whers thers make use of the interactive pace to gather contributions and ive feedback. This i tru f he rom is se up in such a way (e.g., U-shape student seating arrangement) that allows lecturers to move about and approach students.

The use of semiotic resources in the summarizing move appears to be similar to the seting up and contextualizing moves because they are characterized y the orchestration of spoken, written and, occasionall, N modes. In relation to the spoken mode, lecturers tend to repeat the concepts that have been alluded to throughout the activity so as to consolidate learning. Furthermore, the inter twining of the spoken and NVM modes may be used to connect what has been reviewed with the following topic and/or activity. Lecturers usually remain in the authoritative position at the end of the engagement episode to regain control of the lesson.

The findings of these two analyses seem to show the complexity of constructing Es in EMI contexts, where lecturers are not only confronted with the use of English to teach content but also with the need to involve students and promote interaction. Furthermore, there is also  shift i the teaching aproach, where teacher-fronted and leaner-centered methodologies are combined to give students opportunities to deal with both content and language in meaningful situations. To construct EEs, the first analysisalludes to lecturers use of pedagogical functions to contextualize the topic, set up the activity, monitor students' work, elicit their contributions, and summarize the consolidated concepts. The analysis of the moves revealed that each move consisted of three optional pedagogical functions (see Fig. 3). The second analysis revealed how these pedagogical functions were multimodally configured and implemented to engage student. Specifically, the orchestration f spch, written materials, and posture was found tobe alient throughout each of the moves to construct the EEs. This multimodal ensemble allowed lecturers to reiterate meaning and thus facilitat the expression of content to enhance students comprehension (Campoy-Cubillo & Querol-Julian, 2015; Norte & Morell forthcoming) and, in turn, to promote intraction (intty, 2012). In adtion, i ome cases, s fulflld the expository and illustratie fuctions (Feng, 2021; Rowley-Jolive, 2002), found in the contextualizing, seting up and summarizing moves. Throughout each move, it was found that lecturers adopted a dynamic posture t all times and varied their spatial position from the authoritatie to interactive space (Lim et al., 2012). These changes in space served to promote a more interpersonal learner-centered approach.

This study is not without limitations. The limited number of pair work EEs does not allow us to make any strong claims in terms of the framework's reliability. In future studies, the dataset could be expanded to determine how wel the framework represents what lectrer do when carrying out pair work s within a greater range of disciline. On the one hand, this would permit us toverify if the moves identified in the 12 pair work Es are aso found in other disciplines. Onthe other hand, this would also sere to find out f there are differences in pair work Es between the diverse fields of study. Furthermore, the multimodal analysis could be broadened to also take into account other modes of communication such as facial expression, gaze and gestures, which have also been considered important for effective communication. Not only could we explore more semiotic resources but we could also examine how lecturers set up EEs in other types of activities such as group work, debates and oral presentations. Further research could explore how EMI trained lecturers create spaces for multimodal interaction and implement the pedagogical functions in authentic lessons.

# 5. Pedagogical implications

This study analyzes pair work engagement episodes by participants of an EMI professonal development program. Although they were not taken from authentic EMI classooms, these pair work Es may possibl provide insights into how lecturers can create spaces for engagement in the diverse EMI classoom scenarios and across disciplines. Drawing on the pair work EEs framework and the multimodal analysis, research-based strategies to enhance lecturers' multimodal and interactional competences are suggested. These strategies may be useful for EMI lecturers and designers of professonal development programs at universt. The first five strategies (1-5) consist of recommendations for lecturers on how to implement multimodal resources so as to engage students and allow them to take on a more active role. The remaining five strategies (6-10) focus on each of the five moves of the pair work Es framework.

In terms of multimodality and the specific modes of communication alluded to in thistudy, lecturers should consider the following.

1. orchestrate speech, writing, NVMs, space and posture throughout the EEs to facilitate lecturers representation of meaning and students' comprehension, as well as to initiate and maintain interaction (Multimodality);   
2. share professional experiences and ask audience-oriented questions (e.g., referential and display questions) that engage students (Speech);   
3. use written words and NMs (e.g., images and realia) to reinforce spoken discourse and to represent concepts (Writing and NVMs);   
4. combine authoritative and interactive spaces to promote a more learner-centered approach (Space); and   
5. adopt a dynamic posture to foreground specific semiotic resources and to maintain students' attention (Posture).

In terms of the specific moves of pair work EEs, lecturers should keep in mind the following strategies:

6. attracting student' attention by combining different modes (e.g., spoken, written, and NvMs) to trigger their background knowledge and raise awareness (Contextualizing);   
7. giving instructions by means of spoken and written modes so as to make sure students follow them accordingly (Setting up);   
8. entering the interactive space to guide and support students (e.g., negotiate meaning) verbally and non-verbally (Monitoring); 9. writing students' contributions on board to gather relevant points and provide feedback (Eliciting); and   
10. repeating the concepts that have been alluded to throughout the activity by means of diverse modes so as to consolidate learning (Summarizing).

These strategies are based on the macro- and microanalysis of the pair work EEs found in mini-lessons extracted from an EMI microteaching corpus. Nevertheles, they may be extrapolated to other teaching and learning contexts in higher education to promote interaction and engagement. This is true because as described in the SF-MDA framework for classroom interaction (Fig. 1) lecturers not only choose multimodal ensembles to represent the content (i.e., ideational function) and the way it is presented i.e, textual metafunction), but also to establish the kind of relationship they wish with the audience (i.e., interpersonal metafunction).

# 6. Conclusions

This paper invites refection on how EMI lecturers set up spaces for interaction and engagement through verbal and non-verbal modes of communication. The exploration of how EMI lecturers use semiotic resources to construct meaning and to create engagement paves the way to a unfied multimodal interactional competence In general, the mastery of this competence enables ecturers to convert students from pasive isteners/observers to active participants, giving them opportunities to engage in active learning, language usage and critical thinking. For the specific case of EMI lecturers, multimodal interactional ompetence becomes even more important. This is so because the orchestration of modes besides spech may give EMI students the extra support they need to understand not only the content, but also the language of instruction. From a SF-MDA perspective, EMI lecturers should take into ccount which semiotic resources they may use and combine to communicate and represent the content, its organization and how it relates with the audience In other words, lecturers should become more aware of the ideational, textual and interpersonal metafunctions of communication to facilitat the transmission and organization of content and to promote students engagement. In this study, we ave given special emphasis to the interpersonal metafunction (see Fig. 1), which is crucial to enhance EMI students' active participation and engagement. The outcomes of this study point to the need to address multimodal interactional competence in professional development programs, as described in Morell et al. (2022) to promote effective lecturing in the diverse EMI scenarios.
