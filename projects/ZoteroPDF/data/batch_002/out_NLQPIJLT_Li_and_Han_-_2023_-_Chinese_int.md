Investment

While feedback has been found to serve multiple functions, how feedback socialises master's students into the academic discourse community remains under-investigated. The current study aims to enrich this discussion by focusing on the self-reported, feedback-related experiences of two Chinese MA TEsOL students at a UK university. Multiple-sourced data were analysed to investigate (a) the identity categories into which teacher feedback (written and oral) attempted to socialise the focal students; (b) if positioned into undesirable identity categories, how the students reacted to such challenges; and (c) how their reactions to identity challenges affected their investment in feedback-related academic literacy practice. Teacher feedback was found to socialise the students into three identity categories with differential legitimacy in the academic discourse communities. Both students encountered identity challenges, which prompted them to reconfigure power relations, claim more powerful identities, and adjust investment in feedback-related academic literacy practice accordingly. However, they took different approaches to reframing power relations, and their reconstructed identities also differed in terms of congruence. The findings call for more research on the sociocultural and sociopolitical dimension of teacher and student feedback literacy, and suggest the necessity for teachers to provide identity-empowering feedback to facilitate students' academic discourse socialisation.

# 1. Introduction

As feedback research has shifted its paradigm from a one-way knowledge transmission model focusing on learners' linguistic or cognitive outcomes (g, Buter & Winne, 1995) to two-way teacher-student social construction (g, Boud & Molloy, 2013; Handley, Price, & Millr, 2011), feedback has been theorised from a wider range of conceptual perspectives, including academic discourse socialisation (Duf 2010). From this persectie, teacher fedack not only offers students accessto norms, rules, ideologies, and practices of a new academic culture Elliot & Kobayashi, 2019; K Hyland, 2013), but simultaneously socialises students into a range of identity categories (Bronson, 2004; Eraut, 2006) that may influence their short-term and long-term involvement in academic literacy practice (Seror, 2008).

Viewing feedback experiences as part of an academic discourse socialisation processi highly relevant to feedback on academic writing in degree programmes, for its compatibility with academic literacy research in conceiving academic discourse, including writing practice and interactions around writing (eg., Anderson, 2017), as socioculturally and sociopoliticallysituated in nature (Coffin & Donohue, 2012). Furthermore, fedback as an academic discourse socialisation tool becomes even more prominent in the study-abroad context, where international students, often English as additional language (EAL) novice writers new to the country and to the host culture, probably encounter more difficulties in seeking membership to the host discourse community. They have been found to struggle with navigating feedback and experimenting with, embracig, and reisting new identities (Sveningsson & Alvesson, 2003) imposed on or implicitly expected from them (Benson, Barkhuizen, Bodycott, & Brown, 2012; Y. Li, 2021).

Notably, previous academic discourse socialisation research investigating international students' feedback experiences focused mostly on undergraduate or doctoral students (e.g, Anderson, 2017; Seror, 2008), rendering master's students relatively underexplored. However, master's students, most of whom are taught postgraduate students (243,460 students, $4 0 . 2 \%$ of international higher education students in the UK in 2021, Higher Education Student gency, 2022), constitute a major proportion of international students pursuing degrees in the UK. Looking into how the feedback experiences of international master's students interact with their identity construction through the lens f academic discourse ocialisation thus not only allows for a detailed acount of their complex identity construction proces, but also reveals how feedback empowers (or disempowers) individual students identity construction and their investment (Norton, 2013) in academic lteracy. This ine of research also helps to heighten local teachers' awareness of EAL post graduate students literacy chllenge, and ugests possible avenues for ehancing the fback process which in turn facilitates EAL students' academic discourse socialisation.

To address this research gap, this paper report on a multiple-case study on the fedback-mediated academic discourse socialisation experience of two Chinese EAL postgraduate students at a UK university, particularl into which identity categories that they believed teacher written and oral feedack had positioned them, and how they (re)constructe identitie through reacting to teacher fedback. when assigned to undesirable identity categories.

# . Feedback and identity through the lens of academic discourse socialisatior

Academic discourse socialisation refers to the proces in which novices gain competence, confidence, and legitimate membership to engage with the host academic community (Duff 2010). This theoretical stance a) highlights thecitical role ofold-tmers or experts in supporting new-arrival, who need to adjust their think[ing], fel[ing], and act[ing] in accordance with the values, ideologies, and traditions of the group (Duf, 2007, p. 311); and b) recognises the complexity and non-linearit of socialisation (Duff et al., 2013).

From this perspective, eedback onstudents writing is conceived as socialising individual students to norms, ways of knowing, and the social and cultural practces wellreceived in the host discourse community (Elliot & Kobayashi, 2019), as well as to a range of identity categories with dferent degree of legitimacy as new members (Anderson, 2021). Empirical reearch has found that teacher feedback can mediate students' egos (Sutton & Gll, 2010) and their dentities through invoking ther emotions (lave-Encina, Moni, Renshaw, 2021). Moreover, when students enter higher education, their professional identities are not only shaped by the specific feedback they receive (Eraut, 2006), but are also deeply embedded in layers of different feedback contexts that interact with one another (Chong, 2021; Han, 2019; Li & Han, 2022).

Like any socialisation process and identit construction process, eedback-mediated academic discourse socialisation is far from smooth and linear, epecially in the study-abroad context (g, Duff, 2010; Sror, 2008). While thre are successul cases who receive encouragement from the supervisor, seize the opportunity to develop academic literacy, or construct selfidentity as legitimate members of the academic community (Anderson, 2017), other students may have much les positive experiences.In a Canadian university, Seror (2008) found that undergraduate students from Japan reeatedy reived teacher fedack that fixated on inguistic issues and offered unrelistc solutions. Such feedback ignored the students' keen anticipation for participating in content-based intellectually inriguing conversations. It also socialised them into the beliefs that a) linguisti forms override content and idea in academic writing in the host institution, b) L2 users of English are unlikely to writ as proficient as the L1 users, and c) they could and should improve their L2 writing abilities outside content courses simply by taking more time to practice. Although native speakerism and linguistic imperialism have been problematised and criticised (e.g., Kumaravadivelu, 2016), this tendency to marginalise the intellectual contribution of L2 users of English and pay disproportionate attention to linguisic quality of L2 output has not funda mentall changed (Phillipson, 2018) If imbued with the native-speakerism, feedback may widen the gap between new and established members and reinforces students positions as peripheral members of the academic discourse community.

Further complexifying the relationship between feedback and identit construction is the isue of learner gency. Students are not tabula-ras redy to accet all teacher feedback, but are agentic beings with different leel of fedback litrcy i., understanding, capacities, and dispositions necessary to make sense of feedback and enhance learning, Carless & Boud, 2018; Nieminen & Carles, 2022). Iformed by their prior knowledge and driven by their own goals (S. Yu & Liu, 2021), students are in constant search of new social and linguistic resources to reconstruct self-identities (Cheng, 2013; Pavlenko & Blackledge, 2004) in feedback contexts. For instance, the case of a Chinese doctoral student in Australia, Xiaoli, documented in Wang and Parr's (2021) study suggests that EAL students often strive to reconcile between what they intend to writ (ie., often a manifestation of their identit as an autonomous writer and a legitimate academic) and what they are expected to write as conveyed in teacher instruction and feedback), rather than uncritically adhering to their teachers' input. However, since students' sense of agency and ownership differ, to what extent one can reconfigure teacher-student power relation through agentic actions (eg, initiating and engaging with teacher-student discussion and debate, Wang & Parr, 2021), as well as to what extent one can balance between one's desired identity and the assigned or imposed identity, also tend to vary, which points to the need for more studies to capture and understand this complexity.

# 3. International students' identity and investment in academic literacy practice

Academic discourse socialisation as a theoretical lens has much relevance to international postgraduate students relocating to Anglophone countries. Most of them are EAL users new to the host country and the host academic culture (Elliot & Kobayashi, 2019), and very often, new to a disciplinary community (Li, Hyland, & Hu, 2017). While linguistic and academic communities enable so. journers to explore, transform, and construct identities, as newcomers in multiple senses, they are often placed in a les powerful position (Cheng, 2013), confronting greater barriers (Aitchison, Cattral, Ross & Burgin, 2012) than their 1 counterparts in gaining legitimate membership. More importantly, dep-seated unequal power relations in the communities (e.g, how much one has the social capital acepted by a community) may not be easily reframed, which in tun restricts intenational students identity construction and their investment in language learning practice (Peng & Patterson, 2022).

As this inricate relationship between identit, investment, power, and academic discourse community has been recognised (Duff 2010), any discussion of intenational students academic discourse socialisation and identit construction cannot overlook the notion of investment (Norton Peirce, 1995). Investment, as a sociological complement to motivation, is commensurate with language learners' desires, commitment and the efort expended on L2 learning and related community practices (Norton Peirce, 1995). Hence, learners often invest in specific language and literacy practice in expectation of greater material and symbolic resource that enhance the exchange value of their cultural capital (Bourdieu & Passeron, 1977) and thus social power (Norton, 2013) in particular contexts with which language learners intend to engage. In turn, investment (or lack thereof) is the way through which individual larners constantly figure out their identities (i., who one is) and their positions (e.g, how one relates to the group and the world) (ibid.). A learner can be highly motivated to learn a language, but may have ittle investment (and even reist participating) in the language practices of a given community if he or she felt marginalised or illegitimatised (Norton & Toohey, 2001).

By extension, intenational students may withdraw their investment in academic literacy practice, if they are disempowered by the feedback yielding limited return on tangible and/or intangible cultural capitals (and by implication, social power), such as reduced ownership of their writing, low grades, impoverished opportunitie for career development, and illeitimate membership to the target academic discourse community. However, only a few empirical studies have explored the potential of academic discourse socialisation in illuminating international students' identity construction and investment i feedback-mediated academic literacy practice e.g, Anderson, 2017, 2021; Seror, 2008).

In addition to the overall paucity of research along this line of inquiry, even les attention has been allocated to master's students. Compared to undergraduate students, postgraduate students are mandated to develop advanced academic litracy' that privileges knowledge transformation (critical argumentation) over knowledge telling (review of reading) (Salter-Dvorak, 2019). However, master's students are less advantaged than doctoral students, due to their less exposure to academic research literature and less experience communicating with academics (Y. Li et al., 2017). The situation becomes more complex for EAL master's students who, despite fulflling the standardised Englis languag proficienc test requrments, tillconfront the dal-chllng f language barriers and unprofessionalism in disciplinary academic writing (Salter-Dvorak, 2019).

Bringing the aforementioned research together, we argue that the academic discourse socialisation perspective on feedback can offer new insights to the complexty in intenational students identity construction. This framework highlights the impact of feedback on students' investment in academic literacy, and thus on their trajectories toward legitimate membership of the target discourse community; this perspective also conceives students' use of feedback as an agentic processof (re-)negotiating identity, making (or reducing, even withdrawing) investment, and reconfiguring power relations (e.g., Wang & Parr, 2021). However, except for a few pioneering studies (g, Anderson, 2017; Bronson, 2004; Seror, 2008), ittl research has taken the academic discourse socialisation approach to understanding students feedack expriences in relation to their evolving identities, especially if the students are new to the discipline, to the academic communit, as well as to the host country. To address these ssues, the current study investigated the feedback experiences of two Chinese masters students in the UK academic community through the lens of academic discourse socialisation, more specificall, as to how their fedback experiences interact with their identity construction and investment in ac. ademic literacies. The study was guided by three research questions:

1) What identity categories do the focal students perceive teacher feedback places them into?   
2) How do the students address the identity challenges, if any, brought about by teacher feedback?   
3) How do the students strategies to address identit challenges embedded in teacher feedback affect their investment in academic literacy practice?

# 4. Methodology

# 4.1. Context and participants

The current study took place in an MA TEsOL (taught) programme at UK university, where intenational postgraduate students Who had not yet met the universty's English language requirements (overall score of 7 and no les than 6.5 in any sub-test) were required to attend a five-week pre-sessional language programme prior to their master's studies. In the pre-sessional language programme, they received feedack from a writing course tutor on multiple drafs of an essay. In the first term of the MA programme, they took four courses and completed five end-of-term essays. Table 1 presents the writing tasks and arrangement of feedback

The end-of-term papers were graded by five course tutors (Tutor A to E), al of whom had doctorates and three t fiften years tertiary-level teaching experience. Three of the five tutors were native speakers of English, and others were advanced EAL users originall from non-English speaking countries. When assgning papers, they informed students that written and oral feedback throughout topic selection, paper outlines, to fulldrafts could be obtained at Q&A sessions and tutorials, or by email.

The first author approached 76 international students enrolled in the MA TEsOL (taught) programme. Six of these students agreed to voluntarily participate after understanding the research aim and procedures. After an informal interview to understand their prior experience with feedback in EAP writing, two Chinese students, Chloe and Sue, were purposively selected and invited to participate because of (a) their minimal prior experience with feedback on English academic writing, (b) their relatively greater exposure to teacher feedback in the UK than those who did not attend the pre-sessional language programme, and (c) their willingness to participate. Although both students held a bachelor's degree in English-related disciplines, they had marginal subject knowledge of applied linguistics or TEsOL. Neither had study-abroad experience nor teaching experience before MA studies. The perceived mid- or high-achieving performance of the students were drawn from the evidence of their marks in the MA programme. Table 2 presents profiles of the focal students.

# 4.2. Data collection

Following previous research tapping into the relationship between feedback and socialisation (e.g., Anderson, 2017, 2021; Seror, 1998), the current study took a case study approach, which allows for a detailed, contextualised understanding of two focal students feedback experiences in the UK academic community in relation to their investment into academic literacy practice and their discursive constructions of identities (Duf, 2014). The two cases help to exemplify the phenomenon regarding the ientity challenges that EAL students may encounter when dealing with teacher feedback in a host academic community and the agency they exert in reconstructing identitie. Bfore data collection, ethics approval had e obtained from the Human Rerch Ethics ommittee othe university. We conducted semi-structured background interviews, retrospective interviews, and stimulated recall sessins to gain an emic perspective on participants lived feedback experiences in relationto their identity (reconstruction. Inspired by Bronson's (2004) study, in addtion to askin participnts to rell and electon thir ovrallfedack exprienes, w inited them to elaorate on the important moments' or incidents' related to feedack that prompted them to perceive feedback, the teacher, and themselves in a different way. All interviews and recallsessions were on a one-on-one basis, audio-recorded, and conducted in Mandari Chinese, the participants first language. The recordings were transcribed verbatim before data analysis. Table 3presents the schedule of interviews and recall sessions.

In addition, written texts, including student writing and tutors' written feedback, were obtained during interviews with the approval of the participants Since the wrtten texts were provided by the participants voluntarily, we did not have accessto all the written feedback mentioned in interviews. However, the five feedack reports of MA course papers, which generated the large proportion of textual data excerpts relevant to the current inquiry, were well-archived. This bulk of data served as prompts in recal sessions and interviews, eriched our understanding of the context, and facilitated the case narratives. They also allowed for trian. gulating findings that had emerged from the self-reported data.

# 4.3. Data analysis

The data were first compiled by cases before content analysis (Patton, 2002). Since the study focused mainly on students self-reorted experiece, rather than an eti account of feedack provision and fedback-elicitd revision, the data analysis bean with a repeated reading of the interviews and recalltranscripts to identify each participant's critical feedback experiences, ie, the feedback-related experiences that they considered to imprint their memory, activate their emotions, and shape their self-percetions over the research period. Informed by Patton's (2002) content analysis approach, we firstly open-coded the data excerpts that could inform each RQ, assigned initial labels, and then recursively revised the codes and categorie through (a) carefull scrutinising the fit between data excerpts and codes, (b) constantly comparing between codes, between categories, and between cases, (c) consulting literature.

To enhance the trustworthines of the coding and establish a more contextualised understanding of the students' experiences with feedback, 28 excerpts of teacher fedback and student writing, which were mentioned in the participants' self-reported data, wee identified and cros-referenced to the transcripts. To understand the characteristics of these feeback excerpts, Anderson's (2021) feedback categorisation was adapted to establish acoding scheme of the textual data, according to the feedback focus and the criteria of empowering feedback (see Appendices). The self-reported data excerpts and the cros-linked written feedback excerpts were compared to triangulate the students' perceived identity categories indexed in the feedback. Afer the codes and categories were finalised, we developed detailed case narratives. Table 4 presents examples of initial codes, categories established, and example narrative excerpts, to address each research question.

To enhance the validity of data analysis, the second author was invited to code all the data, reaching $8 0 \%$ initial inter-coder agreement and later greater than $9 5 \%$ after discussion. Finally, these categories and data were reviewed again to check if all data had been mapped to the cases or if any new category might emerge.

# 5. Findings

This section presents two case narratives of the focal students' feedback experiences that had a bearing on their identity reconstruction.

5.1. Chloe: making contrasting investment in academic literacy as positioned differently by teacher feedback

The grades on her pre-sessional project and her MA assgnments showed that Chloe was a medium-achieving learner in the pro gramme. She reported that th feedack which struck her most was on two writing task of the course Language Awarenes, provided by two different local teachers, Tutor A and Tutor B. Although both assgnments received low grades (58 points and 56 points, respectively), the feedack reports from two tutors contrasted with each ther and elicited different reactions from Chloe. Fig. 1 shows Tutor A's feedback report.

Fig. 1 revealed that, despite some comments on rhetorical issues (ie., organisation, content, and argument), the tutor paid disproportionately greater attention t linguistic sses (.. gramar, ctatios, and mechanis) LYu, 2020). His egthiest comment was on presentation', especiall linguistic accuracy; and his comments on grammatical and citation problems even spilt over into the content' and structure sections. Admittedy, one may argue that Chloe's language errors might have ben so prevalent that the tutor had to prioitise th rrors over cont ss; ut if hs had th cse, th ould he rovidd more elaborateack to indicate which and how linguistic errors had caused confusion. However, the specific linguistic errors exemplified in the written feedback barely interfered with comprehension.

This contrast between the emphasis on trivial linguistic errors and the intimidating, negative comment on the severity of these

erors (que  f nish ange er.. dfil.. o low) a el s th const bthe orll ow  (5t f 00 and a lack of well-justified, meaning-centred, content-based feedback, prompted Chloe's strong disagrement over and resistance to the tutor's evaluation.

The tutor said that there are quite a lot of language erors. I don't think there are a lot. He said the reader can't understand my essay. . don't think my writen language was as bad as he said. He gave me such a low grade but did not point out where was not good.This is what I can't accept.'

Iore importantly, Chloe's disagreement and resistance was also influenced by her long-held beliefs about academic writing unde.

Marker's Comments (Including strengths, areas for improvement and corrective advice)

# Overall

depth of awareness of the subject matter is apparent, and adequate breadth of coverage is provided within the limitations of the task. While some aspects should have been more carefully considered, in general the assignment shows at least some insight, materials are fairly well controlled, and claims are well argued and supported.

# Content

The identification of the Chinese contextual preference for inner circle varieties of English, namely British and American English, is good, with a clear plan laid out for the development of the argument in order to clarify a gradual acceptance of Chinese English. However, while the discussions logically develop the argument, it's not clear how this all links to the acceptance of Chinese English, which appears to be based on a few claims from new literature. Indeed, the development of the argument does everything to challenge this conclusion, rather than support it.

# Structure

Arguments are developed logically, but there is a disconnect between the overarching themes of prejudices against and more recent acceptance of a legitimate Chinese variety of English. No conclusion is provided So it's unclear how these arguments were intended to develop within a single conceptual framework.

# Presentation

The writing and presentation of ideas are of a good standard. No errors impede reader comprehension.   
Please do note appropriate font size (12) for assignments.

# Analysis

Some claims are unsubstantiated, bringing down the strength of the argument. The problem begins at the start, with some generalizations attributed to a very out-dated source. Otherwise, the line of argumentation s clear and generally well supported, putting a great deal of emphasis on clarifying the prejudices that favour British and American English in China. There is then a jump from that line of argumentation to a seemingly new one that Chinese English \*has come into public recognition" (rather vague, not sure what this really means). The argument seems to be that since there is academic discussion of Chinese English as a legitimate variety, this means it is accepted. But this is a leap in logic, relying on Kirkpatrick and Xu for the only claim of acceptance, rather than explaining how it is accepted. Certainly it is agreeable that the Sstatus of Chinglish is improving in China, but you needed to clarify how and why, and if, in your context, it is having an actual impact on curriculum and pedagogical practices.

# Use of sources

The wide range of sources gives a good impression in the long reference list, but the use of sources is sometimes superficial, lacking a depth of familiarity with the content. Be very cautious of the selection of sources, particularly the age and prominence of empirical research found in academic journals. I think you'll find ideas have evolved a great deal since Gorlach (1988). Regional varieties of English aren't usually described as \*easier regionally recognized and implemented standard"..

the ELF framework (MacKenzie, 2015) and her slf-perceived, expected legitimacy in making intellectual contribution to the academi discourse community.

Iwas thinking, as long as my ideas and logicl structre are fine, itis quit normal having some grammatical problems, particularl for a non-native English speaker.'

(Chloe, MA, SR-IV)

However, Tutor A's over-emphasis on surface-level linguistic erors foregrounded language forms as a gate keeper to legitimate membership in the taret discourse community, and further imposed on Chloe a less powerful identity as an incompetent EAL writer. Perceiving herself as being unfairly marginalised and disempowered, Chloe over-defended her legitimacy as an EAL writer. She continued in the same interview:

If I wrote something spoles, I would assume whether the tutor would doubt that some native peaker wrote the asignment for me.

(Chloe, MA, SR-IV)

This excerpt indicates that, rather than submitting to this disadvantaged position, Chloe srived to clam a more powerful identty, . e., eing an ethical and independent student that she believed the target community prefers (as opposed to adishonest one), through questioning the validity and fairness f the teacher's expectation and requirement of linguistic acuracy. She even ventured a sweeping generalisation that  writers who produce impeccable written texts would be suspected of cheating. By legitimising linguistic erors in EAL student writing, she implied that local tutors should focus more on content and logic but much les on language quality.

Despite her effort to reconfigure the power inequality by drawing upon the native speaker - non-native speaker (Ns-NNs) di chotomy, Chloe paradoxically aligned part of herself with the less powerful, less lgitimate identity that Tutor A imposed on her. Notably, this aligment was not entirely negative and self-deprecating, since Chloe became more aware of the high expectations of the academic discourse community:

I did not realise that this [the language isue is a serious problem before I saw the feedback. Now I know good language is required in assignments.'

(Chloe, MA, SR-IV)

However, Chloe's enhanced awarenessof language quality did not trickle down to any concrete plan of enhancing her self-editing skills or language abilities, but a plan to 'outsource' proofreading:

'Next time I will invite a British friend to proofread my work.'

(Chloe, MA, SR-IV)

As a temporary reconciliation of the tension between her self-identity and the position imposed by the tutor, Chloe's plan to enlist external help paradoxicall placed her into the very position that she had resisted: a les capable, les legitimate newcomer of the discourse community in urgent need of rescue by an L1 writer.

In contrast to her mitigated investment in written accuracy in response to Tutor A's feedback, Chloe was enthusiastic abou enhancing content development and organisation of her writing after receiving Tutor B's feedback (Fig. 2).

Different from Tutor A, Tutor  focused mostly on rhetorical isues, providing brief and encouraging fedback on language quality. Such eedback practice corresponds with Chloe's belief that EAL student writers texts should beassessed based on content intead of language. Furthermore, instead of giving brief and generic praise for rhetorical organisation, Tutor B made a detailed step-by-step analysis on Chloe's argumentation, together with constructive suggestions (e.g, you needed to clarify ..). Tutor B also occasionally hedged his assertiveness by showing trust and encouragement (I think you'll find ideas have evolved .. ).

Tutor B's meticulous analysis on the rhetorical issues did not threaten Chloe's identity as a new member of the community. Rater. his acts ie., appreciating her insights and efforts, pinpointing rhetorical problems, and offering constructive solutions, convinced Chloe that the teacher had carefully read the texts, treated her as a aluable new comer with otential, and willigly helped her to eek recognised membership of the academic communit (Kiely, 2009). Chloe thus perceived herself having an accesible, intellectual conversation with the tutor and obtaining a clearer vision of trajectories to align her academic literacy practice with that of the discourse community.

I can make sense of what he [the tutor] said, even though I didn't get a high mark. He gave detailed feedback pointing out my strengths and some logical problems. He also said if your argumentation is to be more powerful, I advise you to do this, this, and this. The feedback convinced me. I know how to improve it.'

5.2. Sue: sustaining investment in academic literacy by overcoming identity challenges embedded in teacher feedback

Like Chloe, Sue attached much importance to her identity as a contributor of the target discourse community, firmly holding onto the ownership of her writing: I think writing i subjective. I have my own ideas and reasons (Sue, PS, BI-1). While Chloe passively anticipated the tutors to approve her final draft, Sue proactively approached tutorsto discuss multiple versions of outline at the pre writing stage. She was also determined to negotiate with the tutors if disagreement occurred, even at the early stage of her studyabroad sojourn: I always have discussion with teachers when I don't gee with ther opinions [in feedback] (Sue, PS, SR-I). These quotations reveal no evidence of being worried, concerne, or restricted by her identity as a new arival to the UK culture or to the host academic community.

Sue's proactive approach had yielded positive experiences in her master's programme, which further strengthened her confidence, egitimised her membership in the host academic discourse community, and placed her on a foting more equal to that of the teacher.

Once in an email, I asked Tutor C if I can write some background information about hinee education, but the tutor replied negatively But I stil believed this part was neesary. Late, n  face-to-face Q&A session, I explained my idea to her. She eventuly came round and agreed to my plan.'

# Marker's Comments

(including strengths, improvement areas and corrective advice)

# Overall

This is an interesting discussion on the topic of whether the monolingual native speaker should not be regarded as a norm to be emulated'.

# Content

Your content is relevant to the task throughout. But in the final sections of your essay you focus only on the pros and cons of NESTs and NNESTs. In doing so you ignore a number of other very significant issues. Taking \*the monolingual native speaker ...as a norm to be emulated' includes issues such as whether learners of English should follow dictionaries containing native speaker' vocabulary (e.g. Oxford English Dictionary, Webster's); whether they should use grammar books featuring native speaker'stuctures (e.g. British grammar, American grammar); whether they should leam to pronounce English like 'native speakers' (e.g. Received Pronunciation, General American); whether they should study course books written by 'native speakers'; whether they should take tests that involve 'native-speaker' forms of English (e.g. IELTS, TOEFL), etc. The alternative would be to follow dictionaries containing the vocabulary of World Englishes (e.g. Chinese English); to use grammar books featuring \*non-native-speaker' structures (e.g. Indian English grammar); to learn to pronounce English with a non-native' accent (viz. Jenkins' Lingua Franca Core); to study course books written by \*non-native speakers' (e.g. Singaporean authors); to take tests designed by \*non-native speakers' (e.g. Chinese people), etc.

# Structure

The assignment is clearly structured.

# Presentation

Your English is inaccurate in a number of places. This sometimes makes it difficult for the reader! to follow your message.   
Take care to spell the names of authors correctly, e.g. Liurda [sic].

# Analysis

You offer a balanced critique of the literature.   
However, you could be more thorough in your comparative evaluation of the different sources.

Fig. 3. Tutor A's feedback report of Sue's Language Awareness Task 1.

However, Sue was not fre from harbouring doubts about her identity. When a tutor of the pre-sessional course pointed out nuanced differences between synonyms that Sue had presumed interchangeable, she noticed the wide gap between her current writing competence and the expected. She started to question her identity as a proficient, teacher-approved EAL writer, which had been constructed upon years of hard-earned positive evaluation in China. She even became fearful for such nuanced feedback, which implied her 'incompetence'.

I was confident in my English writing because I always got ood marks in my undergraduate nglish writing clsses..] But her feel scared when the teacher closely scrutinises my wording. For example, here, the comment said, when I cite someone's [claim], I cant use "demonstrates" but have to use "gues" I didnt notice the difference. The feedback makes me feel that I m no competent in academic writing and still have a long way to go.'

(Sue, PS, SR-II)

Without further explanations of the word choice problem, the feedback might neglect the level of challenge of ths semingly minor problem for a high-achieving EAL student like Sue. This fedback therefore positioned her at the periphery of the community, suggesting that () she had not yet gained the knowledge and skill that legitimate members should have been equipped with, and (b) she should be able to solve the problem independently with minimal teacher explanation.

However, the identity-threatening eect of the negative appraisal was buffered by Sue's strong wil to make her voice heard and approved in the host discourse community. Rather than escaping from or othering herself in the host communit, she decided to stay and plan for longer-term positive investment into the literacy practices ( [] still have a long way to go.).

After officilly embarking on her master's studies Sue encountered a big blow upon the receipt of Tutor A's feedack report on her discourse analysis assignment (see Fig. 3).

Compared with Tutor A's feedback on Chloe's Task 1, this feedback report did not over-emphasise linguistic accuracy, but foregrounded the teacher's critique and sugestions regarding the topic coverage of the assgnment. Tutor A also provided more balanced comments in the sections of 'analysis' and use of sources. Nonetheless Sue barely mentioned these comments in the interview. She instead articulated her disagrement over Tutor A's witte corective feedback (wCF): I cant gee withis judgments on my lnguage issues' (Sue, MA, SR-IV).

At the textual level, Tutor A's wCF irritated Sue because it failed to justify why and how the identified errors and typos had weakened meaning conveyance, as his fedback also failed to do so in Chlo's case. In addition, the wording your English is particularly threatening at the personal level, negatively indexing her deficiencies (and differences) as an EAL student writer and as an outsider unprepared to access dominant discourse practices (Duff, 2002).

However, Sue aributed her resistance to the disonance betwen Tutor A and other tutors in their attitudes toward Sue as a new member of the community. Before encountering Tutor A, Sue had repeatedly received praise for her written language from three subject tutors in the MA programme, which had gradually rebuilt her confidence and identity as a competent EAL writer.

Tutor B, C, and D commented that I had good language presentation. [..] Only Tutor A said that my writing has serious language deficits.'

(Sue, MA, SR-IV)

Given Sue's confidence in triangulating and criticlly synthesising feedback from multiple sources, she tended to consider Tutor A's WCF as a minor voice that could be discarded. This is also the very strategy Sue employed to address the identity challenge and to reconfigure the teacher-student power relation - critically navigating the tensions between different voices from multiple tutors and from herself (Y. Zhang & Hyland, 2021a) and incorporating the most widely shared opinion to empower herself.

# 6. Discussion

This multiple case study explored two international postgraduate students' self-reported experiences in receiving and using local teachers' feedback in relation to their identity construction and investment in academic literacy practice. Regarding the first research question, .., into which dentity catgories students peceive that tacher feedback ocialises them, the data reveled three identy categories: (a) anillegitimate EAL writer with limited right to make her voice heard because of linguistic errs; (b) a peripheral EAL writer who ought to cope with the linguistic intricacies with minimal teacher support; and (c) an emerging EAL writer with potential to make intellectual contribution.

Among the three identity categories, the frst two had an excluding and disempowering effect, whereas the third had an including and empowering efect. Feedback placing the students in the first two identity categories often constructed a deficit discourse that highlighted ther limited language competence, therefore retricted their aces to the taget discourse communit. On the other hand, feedback that positioned the students in the third identity category often signalled the tutors genuine interest in the students' in. tellectual contribution and their commitment to scaffolding the students' literacy development (and therefore legitimacy in the discourse community). The students were convinced by the feedack that ther current L writing competence needed to be developed.

and more importantly, that the teacher's suggestions could help them to become more legitimate members of the community.

Adding to the identity-mediating function of feedback (e.g., Anderson, 2017, 2021; Eraut, 2006; 0lave-Encina et al., 2021; Seror, 2008), the identity categorie indexed by teacher feedback revealed in the current study also uncover the complex relationship between discursive features of feedback and the identity categories that students belie fedback socialises them into. Whil feedback featuring poorl justified over-emphasis on linguistic accuracy, scarce constructive suggestions, and harsh criticism bordering on personal atack (your English ..) (Seror, 2008) probably excluded and disempowered EAL students, fedback on rhetoric ssues might also be perceived as excluding and marginalisig. Compared with his feedback on Chloes writing, Tutor A's feedback given to Sue was more content-oriented, more balanced between positive and negative comments, and more constructive. However, Tutor A's WCF stil registred in Sue's mind more than feedback on rhetorical isues, probably due to two co-existing reasons: (a) inadequate justifications of WCF, and (b) the contradiction between Tutor A's criticism of Sue's linguistic competence and other tutors' approval. This finding extends Eraut's (2006, p. 118) argument by showing that the identity-mediated function of feedback is not solely dependent on the feedback per se, but deeply embedded in layers of feedback contexts that interact with one another (Chong, 2021; Han, 2019).

The second question investigated whether teacher fedback entailed identit challenges and how these challenges were addressed by the students. Both participants encountered the dissonance between identit categories assgned by teacher feedback and self perceived roles as a student writer, when they received excluding, or even disempowering, feedback. These identified challenges were addresed in mixed and changing ways. Whileboth hloe and Sue considered identity challenges as a wake-up cl urging them to close the gap between their current competence and the expecte, this positive interpretation was more of a sensible reflection emerging later after the students progressed beyond their intial emotional turmoil. Their more immediate reactions, often imbued with irritatio, confusion, and upset, were to resist the imposed, disadantaged position (Sveningsson & Alvesson, 2003). They also strived to claim and legitimise a more powerful identity through reconfiguring teacher-student power relation, with the help of lin guistic and social sources at their disposal (Cheng, 2013; Pavlenko & Blackledge, 2004; Y. Zhang & Hyland, 2021a). Sue used two strategies to earn a more equal footing in relation to the teacher: (a) proactively approaching teachers to negotiate meaning, and (b) strategicl appealing to the majorityleveraging on other tutors' voices to override Tutor A's. Sues proactivity bears similarities with Xiaoli's case in Wang and Parr's (2021) study in terms of striking a balance between her intended meaning and the meaning expected from the supervisor. In addition, Sue's case illustrated that the power-gaining proces (Y. Zhang & Hyland, 2021a, p. 44) can take place ven without the teachers explicit explanation or encouragement for negotiation, if the student (i our case, Sue) has a very strong agency and sees herself as the ultimate arbiter of academic performance and academic discourse socialisation (alsosee A-Ming's case in Anderson, 2017). Her seond stratgy, i drawing upon ther tors voices illstrates feack as muti-vice ystm in the academic community (Y. Zhang & Hyland, 2021b) and suggests that EAL students might be more easily exposed to contradictory voices due to teachers diverse beliefs about academic iteracy. While adding to challenges for AL students, conflicting feedack from different sources, if strategicall harnessed, may serve as a window of opportunitie for students to exercise agency in selectively utilising these voices to construct identities (ibid.).

On the other hand, probably because Tutor A's feedback on Chloe's writing is more identity-threatening and implying an even less equal teacher-student, expert-novice, and Ns-NNS power relation, Chloe tended to overdo her restance by negating allthe 'game rules conveyed in Tutor A's fedback, distancing herself from L1 users of English or near-native academic community, and aligning herself with EAL scholars working in the ELF-oriented framework of academic discourse (e.g., MacKenzie, 2015). However, her de. cision to obtain proofreading help paradoxicall effected the very position that Tutor A had imposed on her- an L2 novice writer unable to expresherself properly if without extra help from L1 users of English. Thus, Chloe's reconstructed identity was more fragmented than Sue's. Part of Chloe's writerlyself ie, as a knowledge contributor, became strengthened, since she decided to focus solely on isues beyond linguistic acuracy; however, the other part of her writerly self, ie., as a student writer who needs to continuously develop academic literacy, including linguistic competence, was mitigated, or even abandoned.

The third research question investgated how the students stategies o address identity challenges embedded in teacher feedack affected their investment in academic literacy practice. Aligned with Norton's (2013) conceptualization of the interlocking, dialogic relationship betwen identity and investment, our data converged in showing that students tended to sustain and enhance their in. vestment when their slfidentities were appreciated and scaffolded, ie, when the students' expected identity as a legitimate new member to the discourse community is approved and empowered. However, their investment was jeopardised when identity chal. enges arose. They became rritated, confused, and easily discarded the feedback, along with the possible learning opportunities. When Chloe and Sue indeed strived to clam a more powerful identit, some specificstrategies that they took, ie, distancing, denial, and resistance to feedback, resulted in reduction and withdrawal of genuine investment in academic iteracy practice. Moreover, in line with the fragmented nature of Chloe's reconstructed identit, she decided to focus on content and recruited an NS peer to act as her proxy in improving the language quality of her future writing; this decision can have long-term consequences on her academic discourse socialisation, especially given that Chloe was not a high-achiever in the programme.

However, we do notice the possibilit that students could overcome the identity challenge and sustain investment in the face of excluding, disempowering feedback. Sues case ilustrated two conditions under which students might be able to resist the negatie impact of identity-threatening feedback: (a) the student firmly held onto the ownership of her writing and academic work (also in Anderson, 2017), seeing teachers as facilitatrs and resource roviders, rather than authorit figure; (b) the student had acumulated abundant positive learning experiences and affirmative, confidence-boosting feedback elsewhere, which reinforced her identity as an L2 competent user and allowed the student to dismiss sporadic negative feedback (especially without justification).

The focal students' self-reported experiences of being positioned (often unfavourably) into different identity categories, as well as struggling to claim a more powerful identity and adjust their investment, also provide insights into feedback literacy research.

Although feedback iteracy was originally concetualised lagely ased on academic literacies paradigm (Ston, 2012), this onstruct has been continuously enriched and refined in the light of social constructionist paradigm (S.Yu & Liu, 2021); and although student feedback literacy research has consistently foregrounded learner agency (Carles & Boud, 2018; s. Yu & Liu, 2021), the impact of feedback on students identities as wellas the role of feedback literacy in mediating such impact, should reeive more scholarly attention (also see Nieminen & Carless 2022). The current findings thus contribute t feedback research by helping t revive the academic literacy-informed research on teachers' and students feedback literacy, so as to more thoroughly and critically consider the sociocultural and sociopolitical dimension of feedback practice in higher education and even beyond (ibid.).

# 7. Conclusion

Through the lens of academic discourse socialisation, the current case study explored two intenational postgraduate students self reported experiences of receiving and using feedback in relation to their identity (re)construction and their investment in academic literacy practice. On the one hand, our data revealed that poorl justified, unconstructie, and face-threatening language feedack tends to disempower and marginalise students as new arivals of the community and further mitigates their investment. On the other hand, the findings also extend the current understanding of feedback by highlighting the complexity of and the non-linearity between these discursive features of fedback, students identity work, and their investment in academic literacy. This complexity emerges largely because (a) students have their own interpretations of the identity categories that feedack assigns them into; () individual students may take different strategie to reconfigure power relations and clam more powerful identities; c)students are exposed to conflicting fedack from different soure. Howver, our findings sugst that, reardes of how students rconstruct ther identities after encountering fedback-mediated identity challenge, they tend to alig their investment in academic literacy practice with the identities that they attempted to reconstruct.

Although the study exclusively focused on Chinese master's students in the UK and had a small sample size, the findings can generate several pedagogical recommendations and research implications. When providing feedback to EAL students, teachers should keep subtle and sensitive to students learning needs, personal goals, and self-concepts as a better writer, so as to empower students to exercise their agency to gradually progress toward the core of the academic community. Teachers need toblend and balance multiple roles in the feedback proces: a fair assessr evaluating student writig, a keen reader genuinely engaged with the content, and a facilitator placing trust on students' growing academic literacy and emerging identity as a responsible writer, particularly when students are till a a rly sta f a degre rogramme. The bleded roles can be reflected through well-justfied, content-based, and constructive comments, whereas assertive tones should be used very cautiously. Teachers should also be aware that some international students may still be reluctant to attend tutorials or seek further explanations of feedback, even though they feel confused and dissatitied; therefore, more explicit instruction and even multiple trials of writing conferences are needed. Also, instructors of different courses within a programme should communicate more openly and frequently about their evaluation criteria to reduce radically contradictory feedback, especially regarding the language qualit of intenational students' texts. In addition, teachers and course developers should be aware that although degre programmes have ofered formative feedback informing students subsequent learning (eg, the refining of drafts), intnational studets, espeall those with lite positive experice using fedack, might sil perceive feedback (e.g, the feedback report) in the light of summative asessment, which can have a considerable impact on their identity (re-)construction.

Future research can continue exploring the conditions under which feedback might impose challenges on students' identities or help students to become a more competent and independent writer. Given the long-term, ongoing nature of identity transformation, longitudinal studies lasting over a year are recommended to trace the evolution of students identities through the lens of fedback mediated socialisation. Since our study used interview data and textual data, future studies on the relationship between feedback and identity negotiation can expand the data sources to involve teacher-student conversations naturally taking place in writing tutorial.
