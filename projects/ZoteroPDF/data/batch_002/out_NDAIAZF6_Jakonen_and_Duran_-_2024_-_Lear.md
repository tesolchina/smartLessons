Conversation analysis (CA)

Many higher education institutions support the linguistic needs of ESL students by providing various kinds of tutorial services. Although tutorial interaction has received much research attention, few studies have investigated how tutors and students make decisions about what language skills and activities to focus on during tutorials. In this article, we use conversation analysis (CA) to explore how participants jointly set the tutorial agenda in video recordings from ESL tutorials in dyadic tutor-tutee interactions between an L1 English tutor and L2 tutees at a community college in the United States. We examine participants' interactional practices of initiating agenda management, identifying the tutee's language learning needs, proposing learning activities, and managing disagreement about proposed activities. Our analysis shows how the participants orient to the tutee as the person who is expected to take the lead in agenda setting. From the perspective of a learner-centered EAP pedagogy, agenda management constitutes an important practice because it enables the individualization of the tutorial, which is essential in an instructional environment characterized by a diversity of students' language skills and learning needs. Recognizing the situated, collaborative, and negotiated nature of tutorial interaction can help educational institutions and EAP practitioners further promote learnercenteredness in their practice.

# 1. Introduction

The notion of leaner-centered language teaching (e.g., Nunan, 1988; Tarone & Yule, 1989; Tudor 1996) emerged in the 1970s as part of a broader shft in thinking about language teaching methodology. Learner-centeredness meant moving away from a subject-centered orientation that emphasized the learning of prescribed sets of grammar and vocabulary, and instead placing increasing attention on learners' active participation, thir diverse needs, personal preferences and goals, as wellas ensuring more equal possibilities for decision-making in the learning process through power sharing (Benson, 2012; Bremner, 2021). While there have been varied interretations of the term (se .g., udor, 1992; remner, 2021), eaner-centeredness has over the years become a fairly broadly accepted "educational value" (Wenden, 2002, p. 34) In the field of language teaching, earlier studies have explored issues such as curriculum development and task design (Nunan, 198), learner sills (Wenden, 2002), leaner autonomy (Benson, 2013), and the roles of theteacher and leaner (Tudor, 1993) in the leaner-centered classroom. Although these and ther studies have shed light on the nature and potential of leaner-centered pedagogies, there has been litle empirical attention on the interactional practices and proceses through which learner-centered instruction i negotiated and accomplished. A rare exception to this is a study by Anton (1999), who found clear differences between a teacher-centered and learner-centered second language (L2) classoom in terms of the interactional opportunitiesafforded to students to participate in the negotiation of linguistic meaning and form. The lack of research regarding the interactional features of leaner-centered language pedaggie is surprising, given that social interaction is at least implicit in many key ideas in the litrature, beginning from David Nunan's (1988) notion of the \*negotiated curriculum and his later suggestion that in the learner-centered pedagogy \*what gets taught and how i i learned are arrived at through discussion and compromise' (Nunan, 2012, p. 57, emphasis added).

In this article, we respond to this research gap by investigating what a learner-centered pedagogy might lok like in the context of language lab tutorials provided to English as a second language (ESL) students in a U.S. community college. Community colleges are so-called short-cycle tertiary educational intutions, which in the U.. typically ffer two-year programs in technical and vocational fields. Most U.S. community colleges have different kinds of learning assistance centers designed to support students' needs by providing academic tutoring, computerasisted learning, and counseling activities (Perin, 2004). Language labs and language-related tutoring are particularly important components of many such centers because these services support ESL students in a range of academic language skill, typically focusing on reading, writing, and critical thinking. anguage tutorial activities are also a perspicuous site to investigate learner-centered pedagogies in action because individualized tutoring needs to cater not only to students diverse academic language learning needs, preferences, and motivations but also their different study programs and day-to-day changing course assignments.

Our empirical investigation focuses on the practice of agenda-setting in these ESL tutorial esions. Agenda setting can be defined as an activity \*that serves to determine what concerns willbe adressed in the tutorial, the priority of each, and (possily) the order in which each concern will be addressed (Reinking, 2012, p. 76). Existing practice-oriented studies of (writing) tutorials have argued that setting the agenda at the beginning of each tutoring sesion is important because it llows tutors to negotiate an appropriate goal for each sessin (Henning, 2001; Thompson, 2009; Thonus, 2002). We aim to expand these studies by exploring how the tutorial agenda emerges in and through social interaction. By drawing on conversation analysis (CA), we investigate how participants initiate talk about the tutorial genda, make propositions about what to do, and finally arive at decisions, thus exploring the ways in which their interactional work may or may not accomplish a learner-centered language pedagogy. In what follows, we first review existing literature on agenda management in L2 tutoring interaction, followed by the rearch questions guiding our study (section 2). We then introduce our dataset (section 3), analyze in micro-analytical detal how the agenda is set in selected data extracts (section 4), and discuss what our findings suggest about ESL tutorial interaction as a learner-centered space (section 5).

# 2. Setting the agenda in L2 tutorial interaction

Many higher education institutions around the world offer one-on-one or small-group tutorials to support the linguistic demands of students who are conducting their degree studies in an L2. As Reinking (2012, pp. 76-78) points out, institutions may have various kinds of prescriptive recommendations for tutorial practices, some of which also concern the ways in which participants should establish the goals and tass in each tutorial meeing. In addition to institutional guidelines and tutor guides (e.g., Macauley, 2005), a sizeable writing center scholarship has explored practices for agenda seting in the context of writing conferences, i.e., tutorial meetings in which tyicll ther a faculty member r peer tutor guides a student on their written work.g., Bowle, 2021; Thonus, 1999, 2002, 2004; Williams, 2005). For instance, Newkirk (1989) suggests that without an agenda"a [writing] conference can run on aimlessly and leave both participants with the justifiable feeing that they have wasted time' (p. 303). Similarl, Henning (2001) argues that how well the tutor and the tutee negotiate an agenda that meet the tutee's expectations i a key factor contributing to the perceived success f the session. While these and other studies suggest that a clear tutorial genda can promote student engagement, they have reported differences in who sets or should set the agenda as well as how and in what stage of the tutorial it should be negotiated (cf. Reinking, 2012; Ritter, 2002).

In contrast to the writing center studies, details of L2 tutorial interaction have been documented extensively in CA studies, which have explored a range of topics such as advice-giving (e.g, Leyland, 2020; Park, 2012, 2015; Waring, 2005) and expertise (Back. 2016), the role of learning material artifacts (Ro, 2021), feedback and assessment (Koshik, 2002; Shvidko, 2018) and interactional affordanes for language rning (Belhiah, 2013; Young & Miller, 2004) in ttrial intraction. Within this liteature, howeer, a focus on agenda management has been les systematic. A particularly relevant exception for our purposes is Reinking's (2012) dissertation which examined the opening, agenda-setting, and closing phases of writing tutorials between graduate-student tutors and graduate-student L2 tutee. In her data, agenda-related discussions were typically initiated by the tutors through turns such as What are you working on today?" and "How can I help you today?". Reinking (2012) suggests that these kinds of turns pave the way for participants to disuss topics for the tutorials as well as negotiate their priorities and ways of atending to the matter at hand. In yet another study, Ritter (2002) investigated what she termed as tutors \*diagnostic practices in writing conferences between SL stu. dents and first language (L1) English tutors, arguing that tutors tend to dominate the initial stage of the session (p. 167).

Some CA studies have touched upon practices of agenda management while analyzing how tutorial openings are organized interactionally(e.g., elhiah, 209; Benwell & Stokoe, 2002; Park, 2015). These studies suggest that ways of managing the agenda reflect intitutional roles, responsibilities, and situated identities in tutoring encounters. For example, Benwell and Stokoe (2002) showed how identity categories are relevant for participants in agenda discussions. In their context (British higher education), the tutors commenced the small-group sesions by setting the agenda and tasks and by holding students acountable for their academic responsibilities i., for having done the pre-readings and homework). Moreover, Belhiah's (2009) study of ESL tutorials in a U.S. university highlighted the multimodal nature of tutorial openings. The study demonstrated how the tutor's gaze shifts and reposi. tioning of the body toward instructional materials can project the beginning of talk about agenda, suggesting a need to attend to embodied aspects of interaction in analyzing tutorial data. Studies have also documented how tutees can take initiative over agenda-setting. Park's (2015) study showed how tutes begin agenda management in the opening moments of tutorials through two types of requests, which she termed as low epistemic requests (e.g.,"I don't know ") and high entitlement requests (e.,"I want X"). The author argued that these requests activate different omains of authorit as the grounds for ssistance and also have consequences for how the agenda-related discussion unfolds subsequentl. The study serves as a reminder of the need toconsider the kinds of social roles and relationships that turns-at-talk construct during agenda management.

In sum, the practice-oriented literature on tutorials has recurrently pointed out the importance of the agenda for successful tutorial meetings (e.g., DeSanctis & Murray, 2007; Henning, 2001), yet few studies have specifically explored how agenda management takes place in and through tutorial interaction. Negtiating the aim, fous, and tass of a meting is esential because it enables participants to align their expectations toward the instructional activity at hand. Many existing pedagogical guideline for tutorials emphasize elements of learner-centeredness, viewing the student as an active and autonomous agent in decision-making about the contents of a tutorial sesion. Yet, much les is known about how a learner-centered pedagogy can be constructed in and through social interaction. Our contribution to the literature is a fine-grained CA investigation of agenda management in ESL language lab tutorials in a U.S. community college. Our research questions are as follows:

1. How do participants collaboratively set the agenda of ESL tutorial meetings? How is agenda-setting organized sequentially?   
2. How do participants orient to decision-making authority while managing the tutorial agenda?   
3. How can a learner-centered pedagogy be constructed in and through social interaction?

# 3. Data and method

# 3.1. Data, context, and participants

The data for ths study come from dyadic and small-group ESL tutorial sesions at an urban community collee in the Northeast U.S. The participants are a 1 user of Enlish tutor and seven 2 users f English tutees.Fifteen naturally occurring tutrials btween thee participants were video-recorded over five wees during spring 2019. The duration of each sesion ranged from 60 to 120 minutes, and altogether the corpus amounts to 18 hours of video data.

The ESL tutorials were part of the support service ffered by the learning center of the community collge. Participation in the tutorials was on a voluntary basis. The primary goal of the tutorials was to support the linguistic needs of ESL students in the diverse population of the large metropolitan area. Tutoring services were in high demand across degree programs because the college had large numbersof students to whom English was a second language and who needed support to cope with the iguisti demands of thir coursework. The tutoring sessions were held on weekdays in the collge ESL lab, a physical space dedicated to supporting students English lnguage lrning, their familiity with the U..culture, and academic practices in thr instittion tudents could ign up for hour-long appointments with one of the tutors to practice their academic English language skill such as speaking, reading, writing, and grammar. Although a typical focus in the tutorials was helping tutees complete course asignments, the meetings often also involved conversations about cultural aspects related to living and studying in the U.S.

The participants met each other several times (between 3 and 8 sessions for each student). The second author introduced the study to the tutees and secured their consent in the initial meeting, and our video data collction began from each tuteesecond session onwards. This was done toallow the participants to buld their tutor-tutee relationship and mutual trust during the itial metings. On the one hand, the recurrn natre of lanuage labvisits may have helped the tuor to keep track ofech tutee' relevant learnng needs and/or activity preferences. On the other hand, the tutees changing courseassignments presented a need toset the agenda each time the participants met, which also meant a greater range f possble activities and materials compared to typical writing conferences that often revolve around a piece of student writing.

Altogether seven tutees (5 females and 2 males) coming from Bangladesh, Belarus, Ecuador, Senegal, Ukraine, and Thailand participated in the study. They were ged between 18 and 34 and majored in diffrent disciplines. We did not have accessto students language proficiency test reults, but the tute reorted having lived in the U.. between 1. and 6 year at the time of data collection. Their oral skill in Englis varied, and some reported having few opportunitie to interact with L1 usersof English speakers outside the college. The tutor had been working in the ESL lab for 1.5 years, teaching ESL writing, conversational practice, and exam practice. She had earlier completed a BA degree in public relations and journalism, and was completing an MA in TESOL at a U.S. university at the time of data collection. She also had previously worked as ateaching assistant i an intensive ESL summer course, which had given her experience in designing learning activities and supporting ESL students in preparation for a college-level writing test.

Alldata were collected with the informed consent obtained from participants and approved by the institutional review board of the community college. In the extracts shown in this article, we have removed any identifier related to the insttion and have replaced participants names by pseudonyms to protect anonymity. We have also blurred the faces of those participants who requested it

# 3.2. Methodological framework

We analyze the data from a conversation analytical perspective (see e.g., Sacks et al., 1974; Sidnell & Stivers, 2012). CA aims to describe the organization of interaction from an emic perspective by grounding analytical claims in participants' observable orientations in interaction. A multimodal research orientation in CA entails a focus on micro-level detail of how participants use not only talk but also embodied conduct (gaze, gesture, movement, ec.) and the surrounding material environment as resources for social action (se, Kallik, 22) More specificall, our study is inspired by the line of CA work that has explored how power, conol, and agency are displayed, accepted, and sometimes contested in social interaction. Stevanovic and Perakyla (2014) have conceptualized this as the deontic order of human interaction, which includes the ways in which participants orient to each other's \*rights to determine actions" (p. 190). Such deontic rights are determined by both an individual's deontic status, i., their osition in a certain domain of ction, relative to his/her co-participant(s) (id, p. 190), and the deontic stance conveyed by the linguistic and embodied design of their tuns. o give an xample, a teacher typically has a grater insttionally derived deontic status than students insofar as determining what to do in the classroom. Yet, decision-making in teacher-student interaction also involves displays of deontic stance through the participants social actions (such as whether they simply announce or propose a decision) and the kinds of responses they project. Moreover, these actions can be constructed in different ways through linguistic resource such as modal verbs (e.g.,"You could do X" vs. "You should do X'), which convey different implications about the deontic order between the participants.

For English for academic purposes (EAP) research related to power and (in)equity (se e.g., Appleby, 2009; Bastola & Ho, 2022), the framework of deontics can offer a useful analytical lens to explore these isues in social interaction. For our purposes, it enables an exploration of how the participants in ESL tutorials manage their relative right to make decisions about the tutorial agenda (RQ2) through action sequences such as proposal-aceptance. Our approach shares similarities with Stephenson's (2020) recent study on how EAP students negotiated their deontic rights in managing the agenda of peer-group L2 speaking tests at a university language school in the UK. In contrast, thetor-tt intaction in our study i a context where one articiant (tor) holds more intttionall derived deontic authority over another participant (tutee, but, as our analysis wil show, insted of unilateral decision-making, agnda setting in the focal context is characterized by an orientation to the tutee's deontic rights.

Typical for CA research, we began the analysis with an open stance toward the data rather than formulating specific theory-led research questions for the study. We viewed the video recordings multiple times to get familiar with the data and began paying attention to the opening moments of torial. We then noticed that these moments nolved discussion about the session's agenda, and identified a collection of allsuch instances from the data set and analyzed them to identify similritis and differences across these cases. We described the sequentil organization of agenda setting and the social actions used to arrive at decisions about the agenda. We then made a collection of 15 such interactional episodes, transcribed them according to Jefferson's (2004) conventions adding annotations on participants relevant embodied conduct, and analyzed them in a line-by-line manner. In this article, we have selected extracts from dyadic tutorial interactions for analysis The multi-party interactional data come from one group of four students, who were enrolled in the same course and knew each other very well. While agenda management in the group took largely place through similar kinds of action sequence (e., proposals and requess) the neotiations also tended to be onger and include recurringoff-ask side sequences involving joking, teasing, and occasional humorous subversion of the institutional purpose of the sessions. Exploring the multi-party data (and its possible idiosyncrasies) in sufficient detail is beyond the scope of this paper, which is why we have decided to focus on the dyadic data.

# 4. Analysis

# 4.1. Sequential trajectories of agenda setting

In Fig. 1, we present a simplified and schematicrepresentation of agenda management in our data. As ilustrated, agenda setting in our data can be initiated by either the tutor $( \mathtt { n } = 9 )$ or the tutee $( \mathtt { n } = 6 )$ . A typical way for a tutee to topicalize the agenda is through verbalizing a language-related problem they fel they have (Extract 3). Some agenda management sequences are initiated when the tutee tlls about their strggles with ongoing coursework or simply hands over an essay draft or some other piece of coursework tothe tutor (Extract 2). As social actions troubles tllings and embodied displays of coursework proect alk about the seson agenda, which demonstrates the participants' orientation to the instional purpose of the metings. Such actions are routinely either followed by a tutor's proposal for a learning activity or the problem itself becomes the tutorial agnda when the tutor begins to explain it or help with the coursework.

The tutor-initiated agenda-seting sequences overwhelmingly begin with the tutor's explicit request for the tutee o identify a topic or an activity (Extracts 1, 4). Typically, this takes the form of wh-questions such as \*What do you want to work on today?, which topicalizes the tutees individual needs and concerns related to language learning. The sequential trajecories that follow the tutor's requests show similarities to the tutee-initiated cases in the sense that the tutees typically respond to the request by identifying a personal language-related problem, mentioning thir coursework, or proposing an activity from the resource book avalable in the language lab. On some occasions, the tutee does not make any agenda propositions when the tutor ass what the tutee wants to do Regardlessof who initiates the agenda-setting, whenever the tutor makes a proposal for a session agenda, it i always subjected to the tutee's agreement.

In what fllows, we analye five extracts in detail to further illustrate these diffrent sequential trajectories of agenda-setting in dyadic interactions. We focus the analysis on how the participants create an interactional space to discuss the tutees earning needs and preferences in the early moments of agenda management sequences (section 4.2), how they manage proposals for a concrete activity (section 4.3), and how they resolve situations of disagreement about what to do (section 4.4).

4.2. Creating a space for talk about the tutee's needs and preferences

Extract 1 ilustratesatransition from small tlk to agenda setting by way of a tutor's wh-question. The discussion takes place approximately 1 min into the session, afer brief catching up on recent personal events. During the long silence at the beginning of the extract (line 1), the tutee's (Fai) and the tutors embodied conduct makes the end of small tlk relevant and prepares the grounds for transitioning to agenda management (line 4). The extract comes from Fai'sfifh meeting with the tutor and demonstrates how participants orient to the tutees desires as they manage the session agenda. The tutor has i front of her a grammar activity book, which she sometimes brings along as a backup resource material to the meetings and which here becomes the object of Fai's request for an agenda (line 6).

4: Fai withdraws gaze

During the 12.0- silece at line 1, Fai takes ut her notebook and pencil case from her bag, takes a sip from her water bottl, and puts it away. Atthe ame time, the tutr ateate hr gaze wee ai and the ctiity book ht th tutr ha i front of her onthe table see images 1 and 2). In other word, Fais assembling her personal eaning materias on the table both project and prolong the beginningof the tutorial sesson, and the tutor is oservably doing waiting (vinhufvud, 2018) for Fai to get settled in, monitoring her preparatory work with her gaze. Once Fai has placed her material on the table she corrcts her posture and softly tters the word okay (line 2). The single-word tun marks atransition and displays Fai's "state f readiness (Beach, 1993) for moving on in the tutorial interaction. This is visible in how the tutor subsequently shifts her gaze to Fai (image 3) and begins agenda management (line 4).

The tutor's question that sparks ofagenda management is prefaced with an elongated so', which frames the course of action being launched as incipient and \*relevantly pending (Bolden, 2009). By topicalizing the recipient's want, the tutor treats it as relevant for the session agenda and orients to the tutee as a participant who has at least equal if not greater deontic rights to set the agenda. Interestingly, the beginning of Fai's response (first) at line 6 indicates that she may be about to propose multiple activities. Fai's response (1 wanna work on in the book) i also formatted as a highly entitled request form (Park, 2015) and in that way aligned with the design of the tutor's question. Moreover, as Fai responds, she also points at the activity book in front f the tutor. The design of Fai's request treats the activity book exercises as familiar agenda It is indeed not the first time the tutor and Fai have been working on the book, as also the design of the tutor's confirmation check (more activities', line 7) makes it clear.

After Fai's confirmation (lines 8-9), the tutor starts to go through the book looking for a potential activity (lines 10-12). Instead o directly identifying a particular activity, the tutor checks the tutee's knowledge about a grammatical topic (lines 13-14), thus displaying an orientation to the personal relevance of the agendato Fai. Fai's response comes after a delay during which she withdraws from the mutual gaze and moves her eyeball to the comer of her eye (image 4), enacting what Goodwin and Goodwin (1986) have described as a \*thinking face", an embodied display of momentary disengagement from social interaction. The beginning of Fai's response (yes) is ambiguous in that it can be heard to make a clam of knowledgeability regarding the difference' thetutor is asking. However, Fai quickly repairs the turn so that it treats the tutor's previous turn not primarily as a question about grammatical knowledge but as a proposal for a specfic activity which makes relevant Fai's acceptance (yes I'd like to work on that) or rejection.

Overall, Extract 1 ilustrates how participants treat agenda management as a distinct activity phase in a tutoria sesion, the beginning of which is projected by refraining from further small tlk, making relevant preparations for the session, and by providing signals f readiness The segment also exemplifie a typical tutor-initiated way of initiatig an agenda management episode in our data with a first-pair part ction (question) that trats the tte as entitl o inroduce opic, a persona lerning m, or an activity for the tutorial. Identifying a more specific activity in the book via a proposal action sequence xhibits asimilar orientation to the primacy of the tutees individual learning needs and her deontic rights for agenda-related decision-making. Extract 2 shows a similar tutee centered case, but, in contrast to Extract 1, agenda seting is initiated by the tutee without much earlier small tlk. The episode, drawn from the tutees (Ali) second meeting with the tutor, takes place at the very beginning of the session when Ali demands an agenda with a help request (line 6) as he is still settling in at the tutoring table.

3: Ali shows clip to T

Following a greeting exchange between the tutee and the tutor (lines 1-4), Ali istil getting seated (image 1) as he requests an agenda for the session in a highly entitled manner (Park, 2015) at line6,formulating i as a matter f need'. The tutor rceives the request at line  with  so-called embedded correction (e.g., Brouwer e al., 2004) f the lexical item li used (clas of speak').li does not react to the correction verbally or in an embodied manner during the subsequent silence, and the tutor grants Al's agenda request with a 'no problem' statement (lie 10). The tutors turn affirms the tutees deontic right to set the agenda for the session, treating herself as a provider of an individualized service.

While Ali isitting down (line 1), the tutor withdraws her gaze away from him and fidgets with her hair. Similarly to Extract 1, this can be seen as an embodiment of doing waitig (Svinhufvud, 2018) for Ali to get settle in and to display a sufficient state of readiness. Ali breaks the long ilence t line 12 with a turn that accounts for (cos) his way of requesting help so directly, treating his own conduct as conduct that requires explanation. Ali elaborates on the help he iseeking by first naming his clas assinment (visual aid') and then explaining what he is expected to do in it (line 16). The tutor acknowledges the explanation with repeated affirmation tokens (line 17), which clam understanding of Alis task. Ali then takes out the material (ie., a newspaper clipping) he has selected to use in the task and hands it over to the tutor (lines 18-20, mages 2 and 3). The tutor begins to examine the text (line 21), and the two begin to work on theassignment together (omitte from the transcript). In other words, Ali's course asgnment becomes the agenda for the session.

All in all extracts 1 and 2 demonstrate the initiation of agenda management by both the tutor and the tutee. In addition to verbal topicalizations of session agenda, the participants orient through their embodied conduct o genda setting as a distinct, projectable activity at the beginning of the session. By getting texts and asignments ready, monitoring as they are being taken out, and by pointing at them, the participants treat thee artifacts a relevant for ageda setting. In these ways, agend managment is a material practice. Common to both extracts i also the participants' orientation to the tutee as a deontic authority when it comes to making decisions about the session agenda. This allows the tutor to create an (learner-centered) interactional space by providing an interactional slot for the tutees to introduce their perceived learning needs and preferences for a topic or activity, by being responsive to such needs and preferences, and taking them as the starting point of decision-making about what to do during the tutorial session.

# 4.3. Turning verbalized learning needs into concrete learning tasks

The previous examples showed how the tutee's learning needs or preferences can be topicalized and verbalized for the purposes of determining an agenda for the tutorial meeting. Both Fai's and Ali's verbal descriptions already implicated a specific kind of activity, whether that entails working on the grammar resource book (Extract 1) or looking at a written text or a graph together (Extract 2). Sometimes the tutees stated problem is more vague or broad in scope, in which case more interactional work is needed to establish what kind of learning activity might best fit the problem. This typically takes place through various kinds of tutor proposals for a concrete language learning activity. Extract 3 demonstrates such a case in which the tutor receives a tutee's (Fai) relatively broad problem statement (a need to improve vocabulary) by proposing a vocabulary synonym activity (line 17). The extract is taken from Fai's second sesson with the tutor, and just prior to the exchange, the parties have talked about Fai's future career plans.

1: Fai takes out papers

As in Extract 1, the transition to agenda setting is marked by the handing of Fai's notebook, which she opens (line 3) as the previous advice-giving sequence is being closed. Shetakes out papers from the notebook image 1) during the silenceat line 4 and begins to talk about her recent midterm exam (lin 5. The tutor responds to the emerging tellng by asking Fai to elaborate on how it went line 7). Notice that instead of evaluating her exam performance with asssments such as well or badly, Fai treats the tutor's question as an occasionto veralie personal lening ned (lines 9-10). The eign f her tur fl likeInedto improve my vocabulary) and its positioning right ater closing an earlier activity make it relevant for deciding what hould be next on the agenda. Fai contextualizes her learning need by describing a two-fold problem relate to essay writing: she has insufficient vocabulary knowledge and ways of giving examples in essays. Of these two, she further elaborates on the vocabulary-related problem by saying that she uses simple words (lines 15-16). The design of Fai's self-directed complaint (I always .. use so simple words') makes it hearable as an extreme case formulation (Pomerantz, 1986).

The tutor responds to the complainingly produced learning need by proposing an instructional activity (synonym practice) that could help Fai expand her vocabulary (line 17). This suggets that she trets the utees tlling as reuest-implictie. The proposal is formatted through the use of the modal verb could', which treats the \*projected action as an option, not an obligation (Stevanovic & Perakyla, 2012, p. 307). Fai nods during the following silnce, possibly indicating either recognition or agreement, but the tutor checks that Fai knows what the word synonym means (line 19).In partial overlap, Fai nods and uters 'yes' (line 20), which is a more unambiguous claim of knowing the word. Nevertheles, the tutor launches an extended explanation of the word synonym', first defining it (lines 21-22) and then providing example word pairs (line 23). Fai nods again (line 24), and the tutor recaps the definition (lines 25-26), this time emphasizing that synonyms are different' words, and gives a further example of synonym pair (line 28). Following the expla nation, Fai shows that she treats the tutor's action as a proposal by verbally accepting the roposed agenda, formulating her acceptance as an issue of deire (I wado hat, ine32). Having agred upon an genda, the articipants then proeed to bein th tas (lin 33)

Extract 3 exemplified the proces of reaching an agrement on the agenda in a situation in which the tutee's way of participating in the decision-making is les forthright as conveyed by the direct requests in Extracts 1-2. Nevertheless in Extract 3 Fai makes her wishes and expectations towards language learning very explit thus demonstrating language awareness and agency over her own learning proces. However, and as earlier research on learner-centered language cassrooms has pointed out, it is not always the case that students know what they want (unan, 2012, p. 54) or do not make this as clear as Fai does in Extract 3. Extract 4 ilustrates ow course assignments can provide an entry point for setting an agenda in a situation in which the tutee does not provide any particular wishes for an agenda when requested. The extract is taken from the tutees (Ana) third esion. Just prior to the extract, the tutor has been complaining about the big differences between day and night temperatures in the spring, from which she transitions to begin agenda setting at line 5.

4: Ana hands over text 5: Ana points at text

The tutor seems to make an asessment to close her complaining sequence at line 3 and simultaneously leans forward (image 2) closer to the table. Followed by a 1.3- silence, she uses the transition marker so' to preface a typical agenda-inquiring question (what do you wanna work on?) as a pending activity (Bolden, 2009). Similar to Extract 1, the question seeks information about the tutee's reason for visiting the language lab and foregrounds the tutee's personal learning aims. While delivering the question, the tutor aso pulls the chair between the participants (Ana is off-camera, to the right) away from the table (image 3). The tutor's two embodied actions can be seen as preparatory work that projects and enables participants to establish a joint visual focus on texts that might be placed and scrutinized on the table. However, instead of responding with a turn that would identify a particular language skill task, or topic as an agenda for the session, Ana displays indecisiveness with the prepositioned epistemic hedge I don't know' (Weatherall, 2011) and rolls the all back to the tutor by asking her help with 'something (line 7). In other words, Ana does not take up the deontic authority to set the agenda that the tutor's question at line 5 projects for her. Interestingly, Ana follows her turn with laughter, which is ften used as a resource for managing moments of interactional trouble e., Glenn & Holt, 2013). Here, Ana's lughter seems to account for her lack of initiative in agenda-setting as a delicate matter and orient to the possbility that coming to the tutorial without a purpose for thevisit can potentially give rise toa negative impression of herself as a disengaged student.

The tutor receives Ana's refusal to propose an agenda as unproblematic (sure', line 8). During the subsequent silence, she los up and has her mouth open, suggesting that h is momentarily disengaging from interaction but i about to contiue talking. By offering a choice between activities (lines 10-11, the tutor treats Ana as someone whose agency in the tutorial meeting needs to be supported. While offering an alternative choice does limit the range of projected options it sill treats Ana as the primary decision-maker regarding what to do. Asking for Ana's preferences' (line 10) could potentiall orient to the relatively brief shared history betwen the participants, this being Ana's third meting; at the same time, t reminds the tutee about the expected deontic roles of the tutorial. Ana initiall chooses to work on an essay and accounts for her choice by pointing out is relevance to her current cass work (line 13) The tutor acknowledges her choice and offers to get a sample essay from the language lab (line 15), which Ana accepts i a les than enthusiastic manner ( tuhh maybe', line 17). The tutor orients to the hesitation in Ana's response by offering another option, i.e. to work on an essay topic Ana might wish for (line 15).

While Ana initially emphaticall insists that she does not have atopic in mind (line 19), she seems to shift course and begins to search for materials from her bag, and eventually hands over asample assgnment to the tutor (image 4), a paragraph (line 22). Ana describes what the text is (lines 24-26), and the tutor begins to examine it (image 5). Going through the text, the tutor paraphrases the title of the essay aloud, which Ana acknowledges (line 30). The tutor also treats the word obese' as a possiby unfamiliar word to Ana by replacing it with the expression very overweight' in her turn (line 31). Ana treats this as a knowledge check by responding with multiple, emphatic claims of knowing the word (tyeah I know yes tuhhuh, line 32). A long silence ensues during which the tutor examines the text, afer which she starts to explain its contents to Ana, eventually providing more examples and asking Ana to come up with reasons why an obesity tax might be a good or a bad idea (not shown in the transcript). In other words, the negotiated agenda involves making sense of aclassoom text and assting Ana in preparing for the eventualessay writing task.

All in al, identifying the tutee's needs takes considerably more efort in Extract 4 than in Extract 3, and the proces of agreeing upon an agenda is also much more implicit, with no verbal proposal and aceptance sequence over a particular activity. Yet, the participants proceed with a shared understanding of what to do next, despite some misaligned orientations towards Ana's vocabulary knowledge (see also Extract 5 in the next section). When the tutee does not provide aclear preference for the agenda, as is the case here, a course assignment or another text can become treated as the agenda itself, an object of sense-making, clari fication of understanding, and language-related instruction. While it may initially seem that the tutor is leading the agenda management in Extract 4 with the series of alternative questions, the questions and their sequential environment suggest that they are done to promote the tutee's participation in the decision-making, as if to 'nudge' her to take up the deontic authority to identify an agenda.

# 4.4. Managing disagreement about the proposed agenda

Our final extract illstrates a situation of emergent disagreement in which the tutee initially appears to agree with the tutor's activity proposal but then backs out from the agreement by identifying a learning need for which the proposed activity is not an ideal fit Similar to previous cases, the extract demonstrates the key role that the tute's verbalized learning need plays in agenda setting, here in the sense thatthe problem the student identifies (vocabulary) becomes the basis for new agenda proposal. The extract features the tutor and Ana and comes from their second sesson. As in Extract 4, Ana initially comes across as somewhat inconclusive about What she would like t do during the session. Extract 5 shows the very beginning of the recording as Ana tell the tutor that she has no homework they could work on during the session (lines 1-2), suggesting participants have aready started talking about the agenda.

1-2: Ana withdraws gaze

Over lines 5-6 and 8, the tutor proposes working on essay writig and offersto go get a topic. Ana provides early agreeing responses to both turns (lines 7, 9-10), prosodically delivered with  high-rising intonation Thetutor then decribes the instructional focus of the essay writing task it would allow her to get a sense of what kinds of grammatical problems Ana may have (lines 11-13). In producing the turn, the tutor self-repairs the way she refers to the actors of the proposed activity (I could' $- >$ 'we could'). This way she maintains an orientation to decision-making as a joint and collaborative interactional project. The tutor also mitigates her turn by adding that Ana may not have any problems at ll (line 15). By treating the tutee's problems' as unfamiliar, the tutor not only orients to the limited shared interactional history between the participants but aso conveys ther relevance for the tutorial agenda. Atthis stage, Ana begins to treat the projected agenda as problematic. Immediately after yet another agreement token, she takes a sharp in-breath and shifts her gaze first up and then away fromthe techer tomidstace (line 17, se mages 12). It es like shes aout to take  un (erm) but that gets overlapped by the tutor, who outlines what kinds of further agenda working on the essay topic would involve ('then we can do more grammar later on', lines 18-19).

Ana responds by verbalizing a learning need, her big problem' in using L2 (line 21 onwards). Her turn contains a number of hesitation markers, pauses, and a word search, which she conveys through embodied conduct by displaying her hands in mid-air, palms facing upwards (see image 3). She resolves the word search by uttering the phrase 'my dictionary is' (line 2), which the tutor immediately corrects. Simultaneously, Ana is already providing an embodied completion (see Olsher, 2004) for her problem description by way of a pinching gesture (image 4), which is arecognizable depiction of smallness. The tutor orients to the gesture by providing a potential word (limited) that the gesture represents in this context (line 25) and by repeating the word at line 27 to correct another word (easy') that Ana uses after her gesture.

Once Ana's problem description is collaboratively established and (linguistically corrected) the tutor proposes a diffrent task (synonym practice) for the session and checks the tutees familiarity with the keyword (synonym) of the task at lines 30-31 (see also Duran & Jakonen, 2022). Again, the tutor phrases the possible agenda as something they 'could' do and formats her action as a proposal that stil requires the tute's accetance, whichtrets the tute as the ultimate dentic athority. he ttor also verbally and explicitly orients to Ana's wishes being a relevant factor in agenda-related decision-making (line 31), and thereby provides an interactional space for Ana to ther accept or rect the proposed task. Ana's two agrement tokens (lines 34, 37) suffice as  go-ahead signal for the tutor to begin the task (lines 35-36, 38).

# 5. Discussion and conclusion

This study has explored agenda setting in dyadic ESL language lab tutorials by analyzing how participants jointly manage the session agenda and how such interactional activities are organized sequentilly (RQ1); and how participants orient to their decisionmaking related (i.e., deontic) rights and authority during agenda setting (RQ2). The CA analysis has shown that agenda-setting can be made interactionallyrelevant and intiated by both the tutor and the tutee. A typical way for the tutor to initiate agenda setting is through explicit requests for the utee o propose a topic or a task for the session. This might take the form ofservice ffers such as "How can I help you today?" or questions that topicalize the tutee's personal needs, aims, and concerns related to language learning such as \*What do you want to do today?" (seeaso Ritter, 2002; Reinking, 2012). As interactional turns, these inquiries place the recipient in a position where they can request lening topics or activitie to do in thesesion, and thus treat them as a participant who is expected to exercise significant deontic authority. In addition to the tutor-initiated intances, agenda management i our data also routinely begins with the tutes problem statements or troubles-teling (Extracts 2 and 3; also Extract innon-intial position), which are followed by a pedagogical response such as a proposal for a learning activity that somehow addresses the problem. Besides tutees' verbal problem statements, tutees ways of taking out and browsing their leaning materials (course assgnments, notebooks, etc.) can also project the binning f anda setig (Eracts 1, 3, 4), a finding that aligs with stdes ., Behiah, 2009 that det tutrial interaction as fundamentally multimodal and material activity where participants inspect each ther's embodied actions by reference to the institutional purpose of the sessions.

Previous research on agenda management in ESL tutorial interactions has taken an interest in participants interactional roles and power dimensions (e.g., Riter, 2002; Thompson, 2009; Thonus, 1999. ome scholars have identified interactional phenomena such as turn length as an indicator of interactional dominance (Ritter, 2002; Thonus, 1999). Investigating our cases of agenda management through a CA deontic lens, we do not oserve the tutor to dominate agenda seting. Quite the opposite, the participants orient to the tutee as the person who is expected to take the led in agenda-setting. The tutor makes his visible by asking (Extract 1, 4, 5) as well as waiting (Extracts 1-3) for the tut to introduce opics for the session beforeoffering them and by revising her agenda proposals if they do not appear to fit the tutee's needs (Extract 5). The tutees treat themselves as entitled to set the agenda by expressing personal learning needs or desires (Extracts 2-3; see also Park, 2015) and by treating their lck of intiative as interactionall problematic (Extract 4). Our study thus demonstrates that the decision-making rights and responsibilitie of the tutor and the tutee are linked and emerge through joint and situated negotiation. We have observed that some tute in our dataset seem to take a more active role in directing the focus of the tutorial around their personal needs (eg, Fai in Extract 3). On the other hand, when the tuteedisplays less determination towards the agenda, the tutor tends to adjust her practices in ways that nevertheles maintain tuee agency, such as by fishing for possbleactivities that the tute would like to do (Extract 4) or by asking about the tutee's coursework (Extract 5).n ll these ways, the tuteeis treated as a participant with considerable deontic authorit in the tutorials when it comes tosting the agenda.

Based on the analysis, we argue that agenda management sequences are a key practice for configuring what Nunan (2012) has described as the "negotiated currculum". Setting the agenda together allows participants tosee agreement on a mutual goal for the tutorial sesson, providing a way for them to discuss \*what gets taught and how it is learned (Nunan, 2012, p. 57). Explit agenda management enables participants to sustain a learner-centered interactional and pedagogical space in the tutorial. In this sense, the ways in which the agenda is negotiated (or not negotiated at all) make visible situated institutional ideologies and pedagogical norms about the role of the tutrial in the student's learning proces. In our cases, the tutor, through her interactional conduct, supports the tutees dentic authorit in desion-making, which can be snto facilitate lrner autonmy, active participation, and elf-reulation of the learning proces, and to ensure the tutoria sessions have personal relevanceto tutees and that they support tutees coursework. Having recurring opportunities to articulate one's personally flt larning goals can also help the tutor to get to know the tutee as a person and their needs better, which can potentilly enable more individualized instruction. Deontically, the participants seem to orient to a division of labor and responsibilities regarding the \*what" and the how of the agenda: Whereas the tuteeis treated as the individual who i expected to identify topics for the session, it is the tutor who tends to propose how those topics could be addressed through particular activities (Extracts 3, 4, 5) other than helping with the tutee's coursework or working on the activity book.

It i nteresting that in our datathe tutor seems to have atoolbox' of activities such as the synonym practice (Extracts 3 and 5) that she recurrently proposes to tutees sometimes without apparent consideration to the recipient's familiarit with synonyms (Extract 3). Having arepertoire of pre-planned activities could mean that support is not tailored to specific needs, which could be seen as tension with the learner-centered way of forming the agenda based on a learner need. On the other hand, a repertoire of go-to activities can help the tutor manage the inevitable unpredictability that comes along with the ESL language lab format where the focus is not as specified as in other tutorials such as writing conferences. The repertoirei perhaps particularly useful in initial encounters when the tutee's nees may not have yet becomeo clear to the tutor. In tract 5, the tutor quite specifically orients othe synonym actit as a resource that can help her assess Ana's learning needs in their second meeting. It seems plausible that, over time, agenda setting becomes more routinized as participants get familiar with each other and the istitutional purpose f the language lab. For instance, in Extract 1, Fai and the tutor in their fifth meeting appear to set the agenda with a greater hared understanding of the expected dis tribution of deontic rights and interactional labor. However, it should be noted that a longitudinal analysis of the development of agenda management practces over time is beyond the scope of ths study, and the tutees varying English skils undoubtedy impact their engagement in agenda management. Considering that tutees have very different language skil level, needs, and interest, it is important for the tutor to build a repertoire of easy and modifiable activities, as wel as interactional competence to manage individualized agendas effectively in the context of such individual differences.

There are several limitations to the present study. Firstly, our dataset only shows one tutor interacting with asmall number of tutees in dyadic tutorials in the particular context of language labs, which limits the generalizability of our findings. On the other hand, as for example Seedhouse (2005) has argued, the aim of micro-analytical investigation of single instances i to reveal what kind of general machinery' and interactional organization produces them. We suspect that the kinds of service offers and activity proposals we have described in this article are fairly common social actions for managing the agenda in other kinds of tutorial setings, but ascertaining this requires further rearch in different kinds of instructional contexts. Similarly, the management of deontic rights and authrity is something we would expect to organize decision-making activities in other tutorial and educational contexts, although the action sequences used to arrive a deisions could look different in other institional settings. Another limtatio of the study is that we hae focused our inquiry on how the sessin agenda is identified in the early moments of tutorials, and have not systematically analyzed how the agenda is potentiall reised or recalibrated later during the sessons. Thus, agenda management i potentially, and perhaps even quite likely, a broader concern for participants beyond the interactional practices we have been able to describe in this study.

Overall, our study complements and extends previous interactional studies of ESL tutorials (e.g., Belhiah, 2009; Jones et al., 2006, Park, 2015) by showing how the tutorial agenda emerges through participants' joint, multimodal, and cooperative negotiation. Language labs such as we have analyzed here have a key role in EAP practice in that they function as a support system designed to help ESL students with the linguistic demands of their academic work in higher education. In such a context, seting the agenda locally at the beginning of each sesion isessential for the individualization of the tutorial not only because the students ongoing coursework changes from session tosession but also because of the range of students' language sils and leaning needs. The focal sequences enable the participants to discussand identify what is currently relevant to each tutee within the very broad scope of the language lab tutorials, which routinely addres concerns ranging from coursework to more general language learning activities and sociocultural issues. Agenda management sequences are a key interactional practice through which EAP tutors can provide such a contingent support service in a learner-centered manner.
