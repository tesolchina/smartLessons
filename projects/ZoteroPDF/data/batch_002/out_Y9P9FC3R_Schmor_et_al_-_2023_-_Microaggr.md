This article is based on a qualitative study exploring the intersectional identities and practices of three plurilingual English for Academic Purposes (EAP) instructors at three major Canadian universities. The research objective was to investigate how the authors' lived experiences had informed their plurilingual teaching practices (Galante, 2019; Piccardo, 2019). As such, the authors conducted and participated in a series of trioethnographic interviews which focused on their personal and professional experiences with plurilingualism. Rooted in duoethnographic methodologies (Lowe & Lawrence, 2020; Norris & Sawyer, 2012), this trioethnographic inquiry involved a process of critically juxtaposing lived experiences in relation to common intersections and chosen themes in order to arrive at multiple, contextualized understandings of a shared phenomenon. Through this trioethnographic study, the authors found that each of them had engaged in a process of adopting new plurilingual perspectives and, subsequently, shifted their teaching practices along a spectrum of linguistic and cultural microaggressions to 'plurilingual microaffirmations'. Drawing on findings from the EAP context, this article proposes a typology of plurilingual microaffirmations. The article also advances the trioethnographic method as a critical practice by illustrating how the trioethnographers incorporated participatory, iterative, and multimodal elements into their inquiry.

# 1. Introduction

Over the past thirt years of its brie, eighty-year existence (Block, 2003), the field f applied linguistics has witnessed an increased focus on the multicompetence (e.g., Cook, 1999 of language learners, primarily aided by tectonic shifts in perspective through the Social Turn (Block, 2003; Firth & Wagner, 1997), which highlighted the role of the social context in shaping language use and development, and the Multilingual Turn (May, 2014; Conteh & Meier, 2014), which marked a shift away from monolingual ideologies toward a view of language development centred around multilingualism and multilingual speakers. These turns emerged with a general consensus that contemporary societies are characterized by superdiversity (Vertovec, 2007), liquid modernity (Bauman, 2000), mass migration, and an ease of global ommunication like never before. The constellation of these recent paradigmatic shifts in perspective on language use and usage has, in turn, given rise to an increased focus on language diversty and language rights within language ducation. t is i this pirit hat we, thre language ducators and rearchers, came to develop the preent study on the role of our plurilingual identities in afirming the inguistic and cultural diversit of our learners in the context of English for Academic

Purposes, hereafter referred to as EAP.

The contextl seting of AP is a alient featre of this study, de to the unique restrictions and affordances in relation to the use of languages other than English. EAP differs from other language education contexts, such as English as a Second Language (ESL). ESL programs generally focus on thestructure and meaning of language for general communication. The focus of EAP, on the other hand is on academic languag use and skill devloment. This generally ncludes target skill such as note-taking during a lecture, using formal registers in writing and speaking, and engaging in group discussions (Perez-Llantada & Swales, 2017). While not exclusively, EAP tends to be conducted in a university or college setting rather than within priate language institutions, as with most ESL programs in Canada. Perhaps because of the monolingual nature of most universt settings, EAP courses also tend to be conducted using English as a Medium of Intruction approaches (Graham, 2018), including formal or informal English-only policies (Hyland & Shaw, 2016). EAP programs within such a setting are also subject to the mandates of their home institution, including factors such as recruitment and retention olice, bdgtr constrants and gate-keig pratic uch as plament and ertifiction tests (Mfftt, 2014). Another feature of note is that EAP programs that are part of a university almost always include pathway programs into the university's non-language-related programs. This means higher stakes for students who wish to enter undergraduate or graduate programs at their respective intitutions, as wellas greater pressure on instructors and administrators to prepare and support students for suces according to criteria that the university and its stakeholders determine. The combination of high-stakes gatekeeping, institutional pressure, and narrow constraints of what constitutes linguistic appropriateness characterize the distinctive nature of EAP as a pedagogical context (Graham, 2018; Hyland & Shaw, 2016). This unique context, in turn, characterizes the particular experiences and strategies that form our distinct plurilingual teaching practices in a setting that otherwise mandates monolingualism (Chen, 2020.

Monolingualism is oten conceived of as the antithesis of multilingualism. However, this study engages with the concept of plurilingualism, which the Council of Erope put frth to distinguish a (multilingual) view of languages as separate, aditive entitie from a (plurilingual) vision of language use as part of a dynamic and interconnected system (Council of Europe, 2020). The concept of plurilingualism has since developed as both a theoretical approach to language and a pedagogical approach to language learning and teaching (Galante, 2019; Lau & Van Viegen, 2020). As a theory, plurilingualism focuses on language users as active agents of communicative creativity within and across named languages. Individual language users draw on their inguistic repertoire (Busch, 2017), composed of resources from various languages and metalinguistic tols such as mediation and intercomprehension to achieve their communicative goals. The operationalization of ths repertore is sometimes termed plurilanguaging, characterized as cyclical and emergent, involving agentive selection and organization by and from interlocutors, complex in nature, enhancing sensitivity to language and metalanguage, and empowering language users in relation to normative language conventions (Piccardo, 2019). Pedagogical practices in the language classroom include actively recognizing and incorporating the languages in learners' repertoires, encouraging learners to pursue partial competence in areas of language that are most relevant to their personal language goals, and ultivating metalinguistic skill such as interlanguage and pluricultural mediation (Galante et al., 2019; Prasad, 2021).

Acting upon ths shared understanding of plurilingualism, we recognize that our own personal definitions of plurilingualism have changed over time nd stil dier sightl from one another. As se in the ollowing quotes from our firstrothnographic nterview, Sarah is especially drawn to plurilingualism's bridging of theory and practice, while Karam focuses on the recognition of linguistic variation not only across but within languages, and Rebecca emphasizes the (re)conceptualization of language identity:

A big thing for me was learning that plurilingualism is both a theoretical construct and a way of looking at language and language users, and also a real aproach to how you are a language user, how you're a language teacher, how you're a language student. So the fact that it's both theoretical and practical is something that I found really powerful and really changed my internal definition of what plurilingualism meant. (Sarah)

As I later understood, therei that switching aspect, not ust in the language, but also in the dialect or variety. It's being able to express yourself in those dialects and varities, understand people from other cultures, or draw on your cultural knowledge. And mediation is a key aspect, being able to mediate when you have no common language with the other person. (Karam)

If you know what plurilingualism means and you sort of adopt that definition, it just feels a lot easier than saying you're a polyglot or something. There's ess pressure. You don't have to know every language perfectly. I now see plurilingualism as a lens, a mindset, that frees you and allows you to understand and learn more languages. (Rebecca)

Our distinct yet intersecting understandings of plurilingualism have shaped this article just as our plurilingual identities have informed our trioethnographic study. As thre instructors who identify as plurilingual and work in the English for Academic Purposes (EAP) context, we share a common interection. As three individuals marked by unique lif histries, our experiences in relation to this shared intersection converge and diverge in significant ways. Our intersecting perspectives, as such, are informed both by our shared identity marker as plurilingual EAP instructors and by our individual identity markers. Some of these key markers are represented in the Venn diagram in Fig. 1, and elaborated upon below with further quotes from the trioethnographic interviews.

Within our shared intersection, our EAP teaching contexts are relatively similar reflecting the particularities of the EAP context outlined above. Rebecca primaril teaches conditional acceptance courses for undergraduate universty students. Due to the high. stakes nature of these programs, \*the same materials are given to allof the instructors who are teaching the same level' but she is encouraged to adapt these materials to her learners needs. Sarah has taught similar courses and describes her intial EAP teaching experience as: Here's the textbook. Here are the overall topics. Do whatever you want to do with that." She notes that, \*at the same time, thres preure, buse threr multile cohorts, to be pretty consstent with h ther techers. Saah laer had the chance to develop curricula for the programs at her school. Karam has taught in an undergraduate bridging program, where \*curricular guidelines are given but the way that [he] teaches is really up to [him], so tht allows for flexility when it comes to implementing plurilingual approaches."

While our teaching experiences share several parallel, our plurilingual repertoires and daily language use is rather distinct, as represented in the quotes below, where each of us describes a moment of "feeling plurilingual":

Ok so during my wedding, me and my husband were at this restaurant together in Italy, at a big table, with guests who had come for the wedding, and there were Mexican relatives at one end, and my German host family at the other end, and in the middle was my friend from Canada, my longtime friend, and beside her was my sister-in-law with her boyfriend who is Italian, and during this dinner I was using Spanish, German, English, and Italian, to communicate with some of the closest people in m life, and that was just kind of a very surreal moment for me, when I realized, wow, my life is plurilingual. (Rebecca)

For a while, I was learning Turkish. I had this boyfriend from Istanbul. We traveled to Turkey together. His mom didn't speak any English. I didn't speak any Turkish. We kind of used French, like lots of gesturing and then it's been what? 14 years that I haven't used a single word of Turkish? But one day I was frustrated with my cat and yelle, \*host! Which isn't even the right word. Host means "go away" but I meant "shut up." But yeah, now I shush my cats in Turkish. (Sarah)

So for me, when I'm switching between the different languages I have in my repertoire - English, Arabic and sometimes French - I do the switch naturally and organicall, where and when I fel it is appropriate. So if I'm speaking with relatives and the language they're most proficient i is Arabic, and I'm speaking in that, there are words that I don't necessarily know, especially those that are related to my professional lif as a researcher or teacher. I will use some English, but where I do depends on what I am saying. For example, the names of vegetables or spices, I know mostly in English, because when I buy them from the grocery store, I buy them labelled in English, so I don't know the Arabic equivalent, but my relatives can still understand and the communication is not really interrupted in any way or form, so we're able to carry on. (Karam)

While our individual experiences with languages differ, a plurilingual view posits that we all have dynamic, partial, and inter. connected linguistc and cultural repertores. These plurilingual reertoires, experiences, and associated perspectives have intersected to inform our trioethnographic inquiry, analysis, and findings.

# 2. Methodology: a participatory, iterative trioethnography

For this study, we developed a participatory (Fine, 2018; McTaggart, 1991) iterative (Finlay, 2013; Kerssens-van Drongelen, 2001) approach to trioethnographic inquiry (Davis & Ellis 2008; Norris & Sawyer, 2012). Our objective was to investigate how our lived experiences have informed our plurilingual teaching practices. To do so, we conducted three interviews which focused on three thematic areas: our personal experiences with plurilingualism, our professional experiences with plurilingualism, and our plurilingual teaching experiences in the English for Academic Purposes (EAP) context.

Our trioethnography was roted in duo/multiethnographic methodologies, which involve a proces of critically juxtaposing lived experiences in relation to a common intersection and chosen theme in order to arrive at multiple, contextualized understandings of a shared phenomenon (Lowe & Lawrence, 2020; Sawyer & Norris, 2012; Valenciaet al., 2020). As noted above, our common intersection was our role as EAP instructors and our chosen theme was plurilingual teaching practices. To investigate this intersection and theme, we drew on Pinar's (1994) notion of curere, or life currculum, which informs duo/trio/multiethnographic methods. In investigating how the curriculum of our lives intersected with our teaching curricula, our trioethnographic method allowed for shared, opposing, and novel perspectives to emerge as we co-constructed dialogue and meaning in relation to the topic of inquiry.

At each stage of the inquiry, we paired the trioethnographic approach with participatory methodological principles (Fine, 2018; McTaggart, 1991). A participatory approach to this study enabled us to engage in a collaborative, systematic inquiry as people who are directly afected by the ssue being studied, with the intention of informing action and change within our broader community of practice. It also meant that we shared accountabilit in: 1) chosing the topic; 2) creating the research questions; 3) designing and refining the interview questions; 4) recording and transcribing the interviews; and 5) analyzing the transcripts.

We also developed an iterative approach (Kerssens-van Drongelen, 2001) to this participatory trioethnography. That is, the for. mation of the rearch and intrview questions representd a cyclical, iterative proces in which the questions for the second interview were created once the firt interview and preliminary analys of it transcript was complete. This allowed for an (inductive) identification of emerging themes to inform the second set of interview questions. Another iterative element of reearch design included developing spontaneous follow-up questions while interviewing. As we shared our storie, experiences, and perspectives in each interview, we organically asked questions that pushed the overarching inquiry further. For example, in the second interview, Sarah asked Rebecca to elaborate on a story about using four different languages at one dinner party:

I was just wondering, at that particular dinner, did you find yourself kind of switching and compartmentalizing? Or did you notice a bit of mixing: what does the relationship between the languages look like for you?

In analyzing the transcribed interviews, we took turns alternating as lead coder' and conducted a collaborative discourse analysis (Johnstone, 2017) with thematic coding by using the comment function in shared cloud-based documents. In this way, we allowed ourselves to be influenced by the open, collaborative nature of the coding process building on or debating each other's codes in a transparent, itrative proces, as exmplifid in Fig. 2. This is because our goal was nt to pursue an objective, indvidual oding of the transcripts for subsequent synthesis. Instead, we wanted to intentionally honour the trioethnography's co-constructed nature of meaning-making.

Beyond collaboratively and transparently coding the transcripts of the trioethnographic interviews, we also ended up organically extending the collaborative, emergent nature of our datacollection by dialoguing with each other through the comments function in the shared cloud-based documents. This dded a layer of multimodality to our co-constructed knowledge production, as we authored written comments that further developed the thoughts and experiences shared in the interview transcripts. We also held meetings between each coding round to discuss emerging themes and refine our approach for the coding of the next transcript. It was during these meetings that we decided to code not for consistency, but for instances of convergence and divergence, again honouring the trioethnographic focus on juxtaposition (Sawyer & Norris, 2012).

Positioning ourselves as co-investigator-participants throughout this trioethnographic inquiry, we destabilized the traditional boundaries between researcher' and 'researched' (Milligan, 2016). This led to contextualized, co-constructed findings at the

intersection of EAP teaching and plurilingual identity.

# 3. Findings

Through this participatory, iterative trioethnography, we discovered that each of us engaged in a proces of adopting new pluri. lingual perspectives and, subsequently, shifted our teaching practices along a spectrum of linguistic and cultural microaggressions (understood as small act of marginalizing particular languages and cultures to plurilingual microaffirmations (understood as small acts of including particular languages and cultures). Our individual shfts in perspectives and practices were deeply tied to the particularities of both our EAP teaching contexts and our personal plurilingual repertoire, outlined in the previous sections. We invite readers to consider their own personal and professional experiences and reflect on possible parallels contradictions, or juxtapositions in the findings below.

# 4. Linguistic and cultural microaggressions

During the collction and analysis of our trioethnographic data, we found that a significant theme emerged in relation to lingustic and cultural microaggressions: those that we had experienced in our own lives, witnessed in our students' lives, or committed in our teaching practices. Below, we present a series of examples of name-based language-based, and place-based microaggressions, in order to preface our subsequent findings detailing a collective shift away from linguistic and cultural microaggressions in our teaching practices. In doing so, we draw on an understanding of microaggressions as subtle statements or insults, typicall formed and perpetuated through social, cultural, or historical influences, and inflicted upon people in marginalized groups (Singleton, 2013) Often brief and occurring in everyday interactions, we conceptualize microaggressions as conveying disrespect, degradation, or hostility, whether intentionally or unintentionally (Sue & Spanierman, 2020).

# 4.1. Name-based microaggressions

The first set of microaggressions that emerged in our trioethnography reflected name-based forms of Othering in which, for instance, attempts to assin names that are \*esier to pronounce r warnings that a namei going to be utchred lead to feelings of difference and experiences of marginalization (Chakraverty, 2022; Kohli & Solorzano, 2012; Sohal, 2022). A common occurrence n contexts of immigration (e.g., Srinivasan, 2019), Karam and Rebeca have both experienced instances in which their names became a source of shame or taunting due to comments made by others:

You know my first name, Karam, it's an Arabic name. Some people have even told me to change my name to something more like [identifying information], which I considered when I was younger,t fit in and have a better chance at being like everyone else. (Karam)

My last name is Schmor, and I was that kid on the attendance list where it's like, "Oh no! How are they going to pronounce this?" Or like, "Really, you're going to make the joke about s'mores again? It's not the same. I'm not a campfire snack." (Rebecca)

Whether or not these comments were intended to make Karam and Rebecca feel Othered, they nonetheles contributed to feelings of Otherness and, because of this exclusionary effect, constitute name-based microaggressions. Over time, these small Othering comments can negatively influence individuals' conceptions of social belonging and, as a result lead to racial and cultural minoritization (e.g., Yusup, 2022).

# 4.2. Accent-based microaggressions

The second set of microaggressions emerged in relation to the question where are you from. In our data this question represented an accent-based microaggression, as it was roted in the relationship between perceiving accent and expressing perceptions of foreignness the latter of which Othered recipients of this question. As Karam explains, another feshman during welcome week once asked him:

"No, no, no, where are you actuall from?" And then I said, "Oh, Iraq." He's like, "Oh, no wonder why I hear that slight Arabic accet. And your thick curly hair loks Egyptian." Atthat time, I had not considered before that I might have a slight accent, and I was actually bothered and felt so self-conscious that I ended up staying in my room for the remainder of the day.

:becca recall a student she had from Brazil who experienced this microaggression on a frequent basis while studying in Canada.

I remember my student saying that he gets asked where he isfrom every time he goes to the store. So he would ay: \*But teacher. why do they want to know where I'm from? I just want to buy some milk."'

Sometimes justified by curiosity, an accent does not warrant permission to inquire about people's origins. In populations with refugee members, microaggressions such as the question \*Where are you from?" can trigger traumatic memories (Butler & Abawi, 2021; Roy & Roxas, 2011) while perpetuating feelings of Otherness based on accent or appearance. Interestingly, this question also marked a significant shift for all three of us, which will be discussed later in this paper.

# 4.3. Language-based microaggressions

In English language classrooms, there are likely learners who have experienced name and accent-based microaggressions. Unfortunately, target-language policies may aggravate linguistic minoritization and exacerbate the inguistic hegemony of the English language (Canagarajah, 199; Kumaravadivelu, 2003; Phillpson, 1992). In a country with a history of implementing practices to eradicate indigenous languages in residential schools (Bombay et al., 2014; Khawaja, 2021; McIvor, 2009,pp. 1-12), Rebeca has witnessed various techniques in Canadian EAP programs to restrict the use of languages other than English. These include, as she shares, making students put money in a jar if they speak their language" or keeping a tall of tries for not using English." Rebecca also once observed a collague overtly mimicking a group of students in an apparent effort to encourage them to speak English:

I was standing at the front of the room, supplying a class, and another teacher walked into the classroom. I hadn't noticed that a group of students was speaking Mandarin while completing a class activity, which I support, but the other teacher clearly thought she needed to do something about that, and walked up behind them and started loudly making sounds that sounded like Mandarin. I can only ssume that her intention was to get them to speak English, but I just froze and watched the students faces, they seemed so disturbed and upset.

Karam shared that, as a novice teacher, he also engaged in some of these practices: he would \*deduct participation marks from students as a way of punishing students who used their frst language in class. These practices have traditionally beenframed and justified asefforts to maximize exposure to the target anguage; however, the stematic exclusion of ther languages and the denial of their value in the classroom is now largely seen as aclear example of language-based symbolic violence (e.g., Mwanza D.S & Bwalya, 2019; Wang & Dovchin, 2022). As such, the practices that perpetuate this exclusion and devaluing are forms of language-based microaggression. Roted in our experiences as plurilingual language educators, one of our shared views is that changes need to be made in the direction of greater equity and inclusion in the EAP classroom, where English-medium instruction combined with academic gatekeeping practice can exclude and marginalize linguistically and culturally diverse learners. We believe that these changes often start with the instructor. The next section details our respective shfts away from linguistic and cultural microaggressions and towards plurilingual microaffirmations.

# 5. From microaggressions to microaffirmations

As mentioned earlier, multiethnographic methods have the unique ability to yield insights not only into individual experiences, but into the relationships and intersections between and among them (Sawyer & Norrs, 2016). Asignificant finding in our partcular study was that each of us identified moments of change in our theoretical approach to pedagogy, in our active teaching practices, and in our personal live. More importantly, while the overallpattern or experience of these moments of hange was shared, those moments were marked by convergence, divergence, and variation in the ways our experiences intersected. While some of our experiences converged, or were similar to one another other moments were experienced in opposing or completely iferent ways. In ths sction, we discuss these moments of change through thre shared shifts first, a shift in perception as we reflect on how we reframed and addressed monolingual ideologies; secondly, a shift in practice, where we discus how we have (re)oriented ourselves in relation to the act of policing the target language in class and thirdly, ashift i action, where we dscuss ur changed behaviours in reation to the question "Where are you from?".

# 5.1. Shifting perceptions: reframing monolingual ideologies

The trioethnography illuminated the ways in which the three of us had experienced shifts in our perceptions of monolingual ideologies, while llowing us to unpack how our respective shifts impacted our pedagogical practices. By sharing and bulding on each ther's stories, each of the authors identified key moments that changed their conceptual orientation to plurilingualism, which in tun impacted our pedagogical orientation in the classroom. Each one of us came to embrace plurilingualism diffrently. For Sarah, embracing plurilingualism and moving away from a monolingual lens resulted from an \*aha moment" where she was able to draw parallel betwen discourse shfts and plurilingual practices. She shared a moment of realization that \*luilingualism isnt just about separate named languages, it's about how you use them and how you use the toos within that language." By connecting plurilingualism to intra-lingual practices such as choosing between discourses or levels f formality, she was able to see how plurilingualism was already a practice in her own life. This is interestig in light of Karam's experience, where he also cameto plurilingualism through reflecting on his own life experiences but through a very different lived experience:

I came to Canada when I was 10. When I was learning English at first, it eemed more important for my own studies, to do well to belong in school, or to be able to help my parents out with their different medical appointments. I had placed so much emphasis on it that I didn't even want to speak Arabic anymore, that I started denying Arabic and started pretending that I didn't understand it and that it was useless. I remember when I met my cousins for the first time, after seven years of living in Canada, I could understand exactly what they were saying in Arabic but I pretended as i I didn't understand and kept speaking in English to them even though they could not understand me fully. (Karam)

Reflecting on this self-described language-slash-identity crisis," Karam realized that this act was also connected to native speakerism and monolingual expectations from others since he had previously heard comments reflecting monolingual native speaker ideals in the past:

They kept saying, Oh, you'll sound like a native speaker. You'll sound like a native speaker because you're young," and then me being 10 years old, I was like, OK, great, let's sound like a native speaker or whatever that is.

He credits these early experiences with language learning as well as his graduate studies in creating his overall shift to plurilin gualism. As such, Karam and Sarah shared a general patten in their respective shift - drawing connections to their personal histories. despite the contrasting variations in their individual trajectories.

Rebecca's shift in ideology diverged from both Karam and Sarah in that she reports immediately having intuitive feelings about monolingual ideologies practiced in theclassroom. Whilethis may or may not be connected to her lived experiences as an avid learner of languages, she focuses on her confusion and rejection of practices she witnessed early in her career:

So already I felt before the practicum, before teaching in EAP, before learning more formally about plurilingualism, I felt like using other languages was helpful already, and then, seeing how other teachers didn't want their students to use other languages, I just felt like why aren't they doing that?It doesn't make sense to me. It didn't sem to make sense to the students. (Rebecca)

All thre of our shifts in perception led to adopting a more plurilingual lens. Many possible intersections and juxtapositions can be perceived here for example, both Rebecca and Karam can be perceived to experience change through a rejection of experienced practices: Karam through his childhood memories and Rebecca through her early classroom experiences. Another juxtaposed intersection, as mentioned earlier, is that Sarah and Karam used connections to their own daily experiences: Sarah by reflecting on dail practices, and Karam through the lens of his past. Representing the complexity of trioetnographic inquiry, an altenative analysis is to view this intersection as a shared shift through individual trajectories of unlearning, reacting, and relearning.

One major point of convergence in discussing our individual ideological shifts was in how we embodied our hifted beliefs in our various teaching contexts. Rebecca makes the important point that as EAP instructors, we are complicit in the ideological practices of our instittions, ang: \*t I o think the lttle thing  do in las challeng the yst and, you know, kind of iner ontrctions" She describes her plurilingual stance as covert: \*These are things I wouldn't probably go out and advertise to my colleagues or supervisors ecause I know some of them have different opinions on students using languages other than English in class." Karam raises the question of how significant the impact of overtly challenging a single system would be:

For me to go and let's say challenge these people who use the "native speaker' label outside of my educational context, I wouldn't dare. All you can do is ignore and use the correct labels hoping that they notice. I think even in my teaching practice, I hear some teachers and administrators use "'native speaker' allthe time. So what am I going to do? Go and challenge them? Show resistance? It makes no sense at all.

This comment reflects a broader theme in the trioethnographic data: all hre of us recognized the relevance of making small changes that challenge monolingual ideologies. Echoing a comment from Rebecca, Sarah sums up this shared view by saying: It's not smashing down the gate, it's opening a door, right?It's like making small sustainable impacts and that makes a lot of sense, right? For that further evolution of change."

# 5.2. Shifting practices: target language policing

The most common set of practices we discussed in our trioethnography was the act of policing the target language by controlling language choice in the classroom.This came up several times throughout the thre interviews, and each of us inroduced and reflected on ways in which we had participated in these practice earlier in our careers. There was rich intersectionality here as all three f us shared practices of language policing that we now regret, and each of us traced those practices back to potential origins as well as shared a critical reflection on how we were able to shift those practices in our current professional ives. What those practices were, however, along with where we located the source of those practices and the nature of our respective critical reflctions, was characteristically diverse.

Karam's early career experiences shaped his early practices. Observing instructors during his practicum, he assumed that policing the target language by enforcing an English-only policy in the clsroom was part of his teaching responsibilities. His shift in practices came through his graduat tudies, which caused him to criticall reflect on these early atitudes towards language use. He also shared that he believes he can use his current teaching practice to make amends for his past:

I think that's where reflection becomes, you know, so valuable as a teacher, you only learn by reflecting right? So I would look back at how I did my practicum, that when I got my first class and I had full autonomy of what I wanted to do, I sad to myelf, OK, I'm going to make it right.

Rather than taking an explicit stance, as in Karam's critical reflection, Rebecca's shift was more inrospective. Her former strategy for enforcing monolingualism in the classroom was through humour: \*'whenever they were using what I perceived to be too much' Mandarin, I started speaking Spanish to them. At the time, her rationale was that it would trigger students to use the target language: "it was sort of funny, but then also it wasn't funy ..I guess I thought it would show them that, oh this is what it fees like to not understand what's being said. The shift in her practices came when she realized that she was policing the language use from a place of vulnerability:

Because, you know what, I think I was, wellI know I was, uncomfortable. I was uncomfortable that that was a language that I didn't understand and that's one thing that, reflecting now, I would tell myself and I would tell other EAP instructors who are interested in a plurilingual approach is to become comfortable with students using languages that you don't know, because that's OK and that happens in real life. So why shouldn't that happen in the classroom?

Examining her personal motive for policing the target language and connecting her classroom to the outside world helped Rebecca shift her practices to more inclusive ones that valued learners' linguistic backgrounds and experiences.

Sarah's practices and critical reflection were markedly different. Instead of humour, early in her career she used a technique she now calls weaponizing language" to control language use in the classroom:

H learned how to say \*dont speak Arabic" in Arabic so that I could scare my students into speaking English. I learned be careful because your teacher understands Spanish' in Spanish to scare my Spanish students into speaking English. Like fullon, loking back, weaponization. Showing students that their language is not only not OK, but scaring them with their language in order to get them to speak mine.

Like Karam, Sarah was also influenced by the culture of her institution: That [practice was ull accepted within my school, like that was something my dirctor would comment on and kind of joke about, like tee hee he, Sarah's really got that English-only thing figured out." Also like Karam, her graduate studies sparked her critical reflection. Becoming more informed about linguistic imperialism and hegemony helped Sarah realize the negative impact of these practices, and she admits to having some shame around them: "as a human being its not something I would do now."

Discussing our common past practices around policing target language use, as wellas the critical reflections that caused us to move away from those practices, revealed some rich intersections. Both Karam and Sarah credit their gaduate studies for helping them shit their approaches, and in Karam's case even attempt to rectify his earlier practices.In another commonality, Sarah and Rebecca both previously used strategic techniques to undermine the legitimacy of learner's lnguages in the clssroom; however, Rebecca was able to shift this practice through inrospection while arah reported feelings f remorse over this past practice. Whil our respective shifts varied in nature for ll threeof us, it was through criticl reflection that we egan to embrace plurilingualism in our clarooms. As evidenced with these juxtaposed experiences, through trioethnography, we discovered the various micro-ways we have each shifted our teaching practices.

# 5.3. Shifting actions: where are you from?

The third major theme that related to moments of change in our interviews was the shifing of small, single actions. In our in. terviews, we discussed the impact and implications of asking \*Where are you from?". As mentioned earlier, this question can be used, purposefull or inadvertentl, as microagresion, since it imediatel calls ttention to the questionee's status as an outsider. ll three of us have used that question in theclasroom and in our personal lies however, we have each shifed our orientation to it in our current teaching practices. In our discussions, these shifts can be interpreted as informing, reforming, and transforming.

All three of us can remember using the question \*Where are you from?" in our classrooms. Sarah sums up the traditional way of conceptualizing the question: As an EAP teacher, that's such a great icebreaker. Assuming that everybody in your clas has come from somewhere to be in this room together." Karam brings up the important point that sometimes it is viewed as a valid and innocent question: \*There are times where I have to ask, right? ither to my students. Or just because I'm really curious." However, ll three of us have come to see the question as a potential microaggression. One strategy that works for Sarah is inform. She now waits for the other person to mention where they are from, taking that as a signal that they are willing to share that information:

Now I wait and the minute somebody says "Oh, back home, I jump on i because I'm dying of curiosity. But I'm like, "Sarah. Get over yourself. The fact that you're curious doesn't add to this conversation until somebody brings it up on their own."

By waiting for others to inform her of where they are from, Sarah believes a follow-up question such as \*Where is home for you?" can be asked more respectfully and inclusively,since the person has chosen to reveal this initial information. Rebec also reports a preference to wait for the other person to inform, although her moment of change can be described as reform. This refersto an incident she experienced where she tried to reform the question by asking another:

I was in a graduate clas with a diverse group of students and instead of asking \*Where are you from?" I was like, what if ask, "What language do you speak?" So I asked a guy, \*Oh, do you speak another language?" and he said, \*I'm from Brazil." And I was like, oh so you still knew what I was trying to do, and I felt bad. But that heled me along the path of, let's just not ask people where they're from unless they tell you.

Having the experience of reforming the question, but having her reformulated question interpreted in the same way, helped Rebecca develop her strategy to promote agency and inclusivity in her conversations. Karam's method i a third path, characterized as transform. Perhaps influenced by his experiences being asked this question, he chooses to transform the question in a way that highlights the hearer's strengths: "I say, Do you speak any languages other than English? And that seems to go better because you're recognizing that they speak English and also know other languages." Unlike Rebecca's experience rforming the question, Karam has had success in transforming the question to fit his contexts and goals.

Whether through informing, reforming, or transforming, the three of us have each come to re-orient ourselves to the question where are you from' from a microaggression towards a more inclusive approach to discussing a person's cultural and linguistic experiences while acknowledging that this is a constant proces of negotiation. [Rebecca mentions that \*it's tricky" and that her overall goal continues to be [wanting] to make connections with people". Thistrickiness came up for Sarah as well, who says, \*you're right, it's loaded, the ragmatics of how do you ask, who can you ask?I it reall neutral or i it not? It's hard to read. While none of us spoke of a foolproof trategy for suces in this case, the question of "Where are you from?" ilustrates the messy, delicate shift in action experienced by each of us in both parallel and contrasting ways. Through these dynamic shift, we were each able to progress along a spectrum from linguistic and cultural microaggressions towards plurilingual microaffirmations.

# 6. Towards plurilingual microaffirmations

As evident from the preceding sections, a macro theme from the trioethnographic interviews was "micro". Across the interviews, each of us shared how we applied our emerging plurilingual perspectives and practices in small, gassroots ways in our teaching. Our analysis shows the power of these micro responses to monolingual EAP practices as anything but small If linguistic and cultural microaggressions can diminish self-confidence and undermine well-eing (Choi t al., 2022; Yan et a., 2022), it fllows that pluri lingual microffirmations have the potential to uplif and leverage learner identities and expertise. Drawing on definitions of microaggressions (e.g, Pierce 1974; Sue & Spanierman, 2020) and microaffirmations (e.g. Rolon-Dow & Davison, 2021; Rowe, 2008), we propose the conceptualization of lurilingual microaffrmations as statments, actions, or other instances of inclusion of linguisically and/or culturally marginalized individuals and groups. Just as microaggressions have the most detrimental impact when cumulative (Eisen, 2020; Friedaender, 2018), impactful microaffrmations must be part of a consistent, principled approach. In our pproaches to teaching in the EAP context, we found that we engaged in plurilingual microaffrmations in six distinct and complementary ways. Table 1 presents a typology of these plurilingual microaffirmations the remainder of this section elaborates on the table's descriptions and examples with quotes from the trioethnographic interview transcripts.

# 6.1. Embracing a plurilingual identity

Scholars acros the field of education have recognized the intimate relationship between teacher identity and teaching practices (e. g. Horn et al., 2008; James, 2016; Richards, 2016; Vanegas Ortega & Fuentealba Jara, 2019). This relationship implores that a plurilingual teaching practice be rooted in a plurilingual teacher identity. This was certainly the case for Karam:

For me, accepting that I am plurilingual has definitely impacted my practice. Knowing what plurilingualism means has allowed me to know what competencies it underlies and the different skills involved. I can now leverage that more into my practice, and more than ever,I feel comfortable disclosing parts of my identity with my students. Being an immigrant, coming to Canada at the age of 10, speaking these different languages, some challenges Ive had with my own identity and name, and addressing stereotypes related to religion, to name a few. So just being more open about that I think has created a different dynamic in the class, that they're more willing to share and take risks with me because they know that I've opened the door for that.

# 6.2. Modeling plurilingualism

Once we had recognized our plurilingual identities, we began to model plurilingualism in class Rebecca expressed the importance of being able to share your own experiences, model, embody different part of a plurilingual repertoire and person." She shared how, one day in an online cass n Italian colleague joined her Zoom meeting early while her EAP students were sill there, so they heard her speak in Itlia for the first time. Reca \*think[s it can beuseful to model just the fact that we use different languages. For Karam modelling plurilingualism looks like "shar[ing] the languages you speak,countries you visited, at the very beginning" of acourse. He believes that this "does wonders." While there are many different ways for a teacher to model their own plurilingualism, it is also important, as Recca notes, torespect that not everyone will be the same plurilingual as you." Representing yourself as one of many models of plurilingualism respects the diversity of inividual anguage use and is closely tied to the notion of repecting lener agency.

# 6.3. Respecting learner agency

Part of implementing a plurilingual approach, we found, is respecting learner agency in regards to language choice. Sarah explained how it's 'not so much please use allof your languages individually' or please use languages other than English', but understand that i's your right to use what fees right for you to accomplish the goals that are right for you'." Sarah supported this belief with a story of a previous student:

There was a Persian engineer who was about tostart a PhD and there was some kind of activity where it was a higher level skill So I said, "OK, this is about problem-solving and creativity. I don't care what language you use to get there. Use whatever languages you have, use what you know to get to where you need to go. You're going to have to teach me in English anyways." And the student pulled me aside and said, I don't want to do this because I know how to do this in my language. I don't know how to do this in English and I want to learn the process of how I would do this in English."'

In reflcting on this interaction, Sarah realized that respecting learner agency in language choice is particularly important because"saying feelfre to use this language' to a student could be interpreted as saying they don't have the linguistic skill in English." Whil a plurilingual approach may sometimes be interpreted to mean the incorporation of student mother tongue(s), the plurilingual afirmation of respecting learner agency emphasizes the importance of recognizing the complex factors influencing language choices within a plurilingual repertoire: plurilingual students may prefer a certain language in a certain context, and this language may not always be their mother tongue.

# 6.4. Promoting non-target languages

It is equally important to explicitly validate students use of other languages in class. As part of Karam's plurilingual teaching practice, he promotes the use of non-target languages by comparing words and structures in the languages he knows with those of his students:

With the Farsi speakers, I was able to identify from a reading passage, say on leadership, common words between Arabic and Farsi that phonetically sound similar. I would kind of say it out loud in Arabic, and I'd be like, Did that make sense to you? How do you pronounce it in Farsi?" And they'd be like, "Yeah, we just say it this way, we add this or that sound at the end. But we could stil understand you in Arabic." And when I did that a couple of times with the Farsi speakers, the Mandarin speakers began to compare and were like, "Oh, we say it like this."

Beyond promoting cros-linguistic comparison and metalinguisti awareness, making connections to languages other than English also destabilizes target-language-only approaches. Under a plurilingual view, requiring students to restrict their use of non-target languages i both unnatural and detrimental to the learning process As mentioned previously, target-language-only ideologies can lead to possible microaggressions such as weaponized' language policing. The plurilingual microafirmation of promoting non-target languages can, as such, enhance both linguistic inclusion and language development in class.

# 6.5. Tolerating linguistic ambiguity

Teachers can play an important role not only in promoting non-target languages in class, but also in validating students un prompted use of other languages. In Rebecas cass, this means tolerating linguistic ambiguity when students engage in group work in a language other than English:

When I go into a breakout room online, or in person when I'm walking closer to students and they're speaking in Mandarin, they'll sometimes switch to English, so sometimes I maybe make a joke, I'm like, \*wow I understand Mandarin now, that's so coo!" And then I make a point of saying like, use what you want to use, and you know there's many benefits to discussing this in Mandarin and then explaining it in English when we take up the activity, like, keep using Mandarin, it's OK.

In resisting monolingual approaches and encouraging plurilingualism, Rebecca finds that it is necessary to explicitly encourage students to not be shy, embarrassed, or - worse -afraid of speaking a language other than English in clas. She supports her students use of multiple languages to complete classactivities by being open to not understanding everything that her students say. As explored in the previous section, [Rebecca previously found this uncomfortable, but she now realizes that not always understanding what is being said is part of the plurilingual reality of her teaching context and of an increasingly international society.

# 6.6. Validating plurilingual realities

Sarah argues that a plurilingual approach to EAP instruction should \*reflct the reallife practices of our students. She goes on to express that:

When we look at designing tasks even for a traditional EAP clasroom, you look at what they're going to need to do, and then you figure out how to help them get there. If you understand that part of what they're going to need to do is navigate a world that is in many ways plurilingual, if you open yourself up to that mindset, then that is part of how we need to prepare our

students, right? The reality of our context, at least in Toronto, is that you've got a lot of dierent languages and you're going to use whatever you have in order to accomplish your goal. So why not have that be represented in your language classroom?

When the increasingly diverse linguistic and cultural landscapes of EAP and other language education contexts are considered, validating plurilingual realities represents not only a microafirmation but part f instructors' responsibilities to ensure relevant, quality education.

# 7. By way of a conclusion: a dynamic spectrum of monolingual microaggressions to plurilingual microaffirmations

As suggested throughout this article, the lived experiences shared in our trioethnographic inquiry can be conceptualized along a dynamic spectrum ranging from instances of linguistic and cultural microaggressions to practices that embody plurilingual microaffirmations. Our findigs suggest that moving along this spectrum towards plurilingual microaffirmations may include moments of personal reflection or interpersonal tension that result in shfts in perspective or practice. One example of this shift is moving from enforcing an explicit English-only policy (monolingualism), to using another language to tell students to speak English (plurilingualism/microaggession), to actively encouraging the use of other languages in class (plurilingualism/microaffirmation). Going beyond the examples that emerged from this trioethnography, we encourage readers to reflect on their own (past, present, and future) positionality in relation to this dynamic and unstable spectrum.

Likewise, we invite readers to consider how the proposed typology of plurilingual microaffirmations converges with or diverges from their own teaching experiences. We recognize that the six types of plurilingual microafirmations descried i this article do not, evidently, constitute a holistic theorization of the possble ways to include diverse linguistic and cultural identities and practices in language education. Rather, this typology provides a series of distinct, contextualized actions and strategies developed by three different instructors working in the same context. Further, the typology demonstrates the potential to enact linguistically inclusive pedagogy even in target-language-medium settings such as EAP. Indeed, the enactment of plurilingualism in EAP instruction represents a (micro) resistance to pedagogical monolingualism and, thereby, a critical inclusion of other languages and culture i cls.

While plurilingal practices can serve to critically resist monolingual ideologies in languageducation, the methodological practice oftriothnraphy aoffers critical,collaoratie, and mowering tol for rflexivity and growth. s such, triothrah could be a productive, meaningful, and accessble profesional development practice for teachers interested in collaborative reflection and/ or action research. Through duo/trio/multiethnography, a small number of researcher-practitioners can engage in macro-level transformation. As evidenced in and through this trioethnographic inquiry, there is enormous power in the micro.
