Since English has become the publishing lingua franca in academia, scholars and researchers are experiencing increasing pressure to publish internationally. Against this background, Congjun Mu's monograph complements previous research on scientists strategies for writing and publishing in international journals from a social cognitive perspective. The book utilizes a mixed-method design and provides insights into EAP (English for Academic Purposes) research and pedagogy. Drawing on empirical data and findings from previous studies the author sketches out the challeges facing multilinual writers and offers a taxonomy of the trategies they employ that apply to similar academic contexts across the globe..

This book consists of ten chapter. Chapter 1 introduces the research background, seting the tone for the book. Chapter 2 proposes a social-cognitive framework of writing for publishing in English by drawing elements from intercultural rhetorical theory, writing process theory, and social genre theory. In light of this framework, Chapter 3 provides an overview of the five types of strategies multilingual scholars have used in previous literature of English for Research Publication Purpose (ERPP) and summarizes the widely recognized controversies. The remaining chapters present the methodology and findings of empirical reearch. Chapter 4illustrates the text-oriented ethnographic case study design with an online questionnaire survey $( \Nu = 1 1 8 )$ and semi-structured interviews $( \mathrm { N } = 1 5 $ to investigate Chinese cholars' atitudes toward the controverses mentioned above. Chapter 5 then analyzes the results of the survey and interviews and discusses the significant challenges facing multilingual writers. Chapters 6-9 provide detailed descriptions of four cases of Chinese multilingual researchers of diffrent professional ranks and universit levels, based on interview data and a chro nological analysis of their manuscripts. Chapter 10 concludes the book with a summary of the main findings and recommendations for teaching.

A central theme of this volume is the cognitive, ocial, and coss-cultural awareness of multilingual writers. We believe Mu's most significant contribution is the socio-cognitive framework that he proposes by borrowing from theories of second language writing, intercultural rhetoric, and genre analysis (Fig. 2.2). This framework applies to EAP writers worldwide, whether they are L1 or L2 speakers of English, and unites three communities: disciplinary, national, and international. Each of these communities has its own culture and conventions. Thus, multilingual scholars need to be familiar with rhetorical conventions across cultures, languages, and disciplines. Indeed, academic writing and research processis a dialogical process in which new ideas emerge from interactions with people in the thre communties. The author clssfies this proes into five sub-proces: mtacogntie, cogntive, social, affective, and discursive. Cogntive roceses can be identified throughthe authorsinfernes and introspction during the practice of academic writing, giving us a picture of how they are influenced by genre knowledge and social context. Investigating the nature of metacognitive processes such as outline planning and how these five processes interact with the writer's awareness of a specific social context, offrs a glimpse into writing as a socio-cognitive activity. Moreover, the framework provides evidence of the feasibilit of the integrated application of both cognitive and gere methods. Mu, lik other scholars (e.g., Hyland, 2009, p. 25) criticizes the view that represents writing as a purely individual activity stripped of any contextual or sociocultural factors.

On the other hand, the genre-based perspective is criticized for restricting genre knowledge to the features of which the writer is aware (Bazerman, 2004). The ocio-cognitive theoretical orientation proposed in this volume integrates cognitive notions with a gene approach and leads the reader to experience the thought proceses that pursue the social purpose of aspecific gere. It can encourage the construction of more theoretical models and guiding principles in this field.

Another contribution of the book is that the author summarizes the dificulties of multilingual scholars with a global audience in mind. It adapts Salager-Meyer's (2014) classfication of language- or discourse-related challenges and non-linguistc or non-discursive difficulties (Table 3.1). Non-ingustic or noncrsivedifficulties inude rearch, writing, and reie procees,the (massive) time and energy required, possible preudice against submissions of multilingual scholars, limited acces to library resources, and a lack of training in English academic writing. These problems need to attract the attention of authorites and higher education policymakers On the other hand, discursive or language-related problems range from lower-level superficial ssues such as inadequate vocabulary, to higher-level rhetorical problems, such as hedging and acquring a persuasive style. The atter may present more significant challenges because rhetorical dificulties have many causes, such as culture, cognitive development, and educational background (p. 49.

Chapter 5 is consistent with this thesis, and highlights the diffculties in using rhetorical techniques such as hedging to commu. nicate with reviewers. Furthermore, the author concludes from the quantitative survey results that the problem of multilingual writers lies not only in writing and language isues ut also in content and design. All of these reflections can provide guidance for novice EAP researchers.

Considering these dificulties, and in accordance with his socio-cognitive framework, Mu elaborates a taxonomy of writing and teaching strategies (Table 10.1). In the belief that it is esential for multilingual researchers to understand the differences between national and international disciplinary rhetorical conventions, practical strategies are illstrated through four case studies, each emphasizing the importance of an awarenessof rhtorical dfferences etween languages. They may have implications for multilingual writers from other Asian cultures, i., high-context cultures where meaning isoften implicit. In addition to writing strategies, the author makes pedagogical recommendations for EAP teaching from the perspective both of teachers and researchers. For college English classroom teaching, methods, materias and concepts need to be reformed, and for multilingual researchers, the author proposes the establishment of writing or translation service centers and crossdisciplinary collaboration. As the author suggests, researchers need partnerships with experienced scholars, international scholars in the same field, and language professional. Academic writing is often perceived as being done in isolation, but collaboration helps relieve the feeing of isolation. The employment of a language editing or translating center can offer convenience and eficincy. In this context, collaboration and co-authorship can be transformative and avail academic socialization. These sugestions help to resolve theissue of how the socio-cognitive model can be applied in any academic writing practice. Since most EAP tutors teach international, multilingual students, the book can enable them to understand the writing patterns of second language speakers from Eastern cultures to refine and adapt their teaching.

Additionally, the book sheds light on the nature of tertiary EAP through a Chinese lens. t helps us understand the controversy over the balance between globalization and localization in academic publishing. As a result of the influence of globalization and neoliberalism on academic research and higher education, scholars worldwide share a set of common characteristics when it comes to publishing. Consequently, universities have placed greater emphasis on research productivity to bolster international recognition and ranking (se also Hadley, 2015: 25). The book likewise reveals differences between multilingual scholars in the social sciences and those in the natural scinces, as well as between young and older scientists. These findings may provide aditional evidence for studying multilingual writers from Eastern countries.

On the whole, this book makes valuable contributions to the research and pedagogy of EAP and ERPP. First few researchers bother to discus the strategie from a theoretcal perspective as Mu does. With his socio-cognitive framework, the theoretical and pragmatic values of ERPp studies are placed in a broader perspective. Second, the book refines the sporadic strategies reported in previous literature and organizes them systematically. Itis challenging to bring together an entir array of writing strategies by scholars from different disciplines under one umbrellas logically as is done in this volume. Third, for EAP scholars, this book is an example of mixed-method research. They can replicate Mu's study by following the same procedures. Final, the author's taxonomy of writing and teaching strategies provides interesting suggestions for EAP teachers worldwide.

However, we have some reservations about the samplecase studies. The four scholars Mu interviewed were allfrom universties in Shanghai, and allfrom natural scinces. We would have preferred a more representative sample in terms of geography and discipline. including participants from the social sciences. This would have provided a more accurate and detailed description and improved the generalizability of the findings. It would also be advisable to proofread the book more thoroughly.

Despite these minor flaws, the book opens up a number of practical avenues for further study, making a significant theoretical. methodological and practical contribution to the field. Although the volume is tailored to the needs of EAP writrs reearchers, and teachers, it might well equally inspire policymakers and other practitioners in related fields.
