Keywords: Transition to EAP Action research Narrative inquiry Teacher education

Faced with the common challenge of professional development from the periphery of academia, EAP teachers in developing economies such as China also grapple with the particular hurdle of transitioning from teaching General English (GE) courses. While previous studies suggest aspects of how the teachers view the difficulties they encounter, the elicited data they use can hardly show the real actions the teachers take to identify problems, plan and evaluate changes. To remedy this oversight, this study adopts an action research design (Burns, 2010; Johnson, 2012) and explores how one teacher adapted to her new tasks in teaching EAP and coped with the transition through her personal actions.

The results show that the teacher was empowered in her struggle with the transition to EAP teaching, and such empowerment enabled her to become an active agent in the changes and implement the accommodating strategies for the EAP curriculum and students. The empowerment was also seen in her efforts not only to accumulate EAP-related experiences and bring forth creative ideas, but also to apply them in her teaching. This action research and its analytical framework help EAP practitioners to reflect on and theorise from what they encounter in everyday classrooms.

# 1. Introduction

With the trend of internationalization in higher education, universities and colleges worldwide are recognising the importance of teaching English for academic purposes (EAP), prompting a surge in the demand to engage students with academic communication in English (Hyland, 2018; Rosmawati, 2021). Therefore, EAP courses are increasingly integrated into English-language-teaching (ELT) curricula, focusing not only on general English (GE) but aso on academic English necessary for research writing. While EAP is widely recognized as \*effective language use in academic contexts" (Nicholl, 2021, p. 170), it goes beyond a clear understanding of the structures and meanings of academic texts, and taps into the rhetorical complexties of disciplinary cultures as well as the teaching practices by which these aspects of academic literacy can be developed (Hyland & Jiang, 2021; Hyland, 2018).

Driven by curriculum reforms, a majority of GE teachers in developing economies (e.g., China, etc.) are switching to EAP courses (Jiang & Hyland, 2023; Park & Spolsky, 2017), grapping with the particular hurdle of a transition from GE courses. The transition tends to push the teachers out of their comfort zone and into a series of challenges in EAP teaching, such as the additional roles they need to play (Farell & Yang, 2019), th new reonsbilities they have to fulfil (Ati, Nazari, & Hamidi, 202) the alance they need to strike between language and content (Campion, 2016), and the identity crises they might experience (Ga0 & Cui, 2021). Such challenges, together with contextual discourses, institutional particularities and sociocultural dynamics, may deeply influence the agencies, emotions and motivations of novice EAP teachers (Atai, Nazari, & Hamidi, 2022) een f they might have een experienced in GE teaching. The challenges would be more demanding to those who have ittle or no adequate training or in-service support during their teaching.

Seeking for a likely solution, there has been much literature exploring teachers views of the dificulties they encounter in the transition through questionnaires and interviews (e.g., Campion, 2016; Kaivanpanah et al., 2021). While suggesting different aspects of how the teachers rport her opinions, these licited data hardy show the real actions the tachers taketo identif problems nor can these data present the way the teachers overcome the challenges and teach the EAP course see Fitzpatrick e l., 2022). Teachers and researchers are thus spurred to develop a broader repertoire of \*teacher's practical knowledge" (TPK) (Elbaz, 1983).

To remedy this oversight, this study adopts an action research (AR) design (Burns, 2010; Johnson, 2012) and explores ateacher's "knowing-in-action" (Schon, 1983, p. 49), or the way the teacher tacitly adapts to new tasks in teaching EAP and copes with the GEEAP transition. Knowing-in-action helps to dig up and unravel the practitioner's perception and ability to cary out tasks, which are "ordinarily tacit and implici in our patterns ofaction" (Schon, 1983, p. 49) and \*internalized in our feling for the stuf ofaction) (Schon, 1983, p. 54). Therefore, the findings, based on the teacher's personal actions and reflections, can also demonstrate how her knowing-in-action works behind her efforts towards TPK development in the GE-EAP transition.

# 2. Teachers' practical knowledge and action research

# 2.1. TPK: roles and components

TPK (Teachers' Practical Knowledge) typically refers to the professional knowledge teachers generate through reflections on personal experiences and verify through actions (Fenstermacher, 1994; Lampert, 2010; Wei et al., 2022; Wei & Lu, 2022). Thus TPK relates both to knowing and practical knowledge. Knowing is a problem-solving proces of inquiry, leading to the derivation of knowledge (Wei et al., 2022). Consequently, TPK can be developed by addressing emerging problems within a pedagogical context and striving for olutions. However, TPK is not ony from but also for teachers actions Lampert, 010) so its validty rests on th way what they know is enacted in teaching (Connelly et al. 1997). That is how we seethe pragmatistic role of practical knowledge in the TPK development, which is aligned with how AR defines knowledge:

.. knowledge may be defined as what we've learned working in a context of action and that is the result of the transformation of our experience in conversation with both ef and others that allows us consistently to create useful actions that leave us and our co-inquirers stronger (Reason & Bradbury, 2008, pp. 5-6).

With its emphasis on the values of teachers' personal tacit and experiential knowledge (Chaharbashloo et al., 2020; Elbaz, 1981), TPK is personal, contextual, experience-based, and content-driven (Clandinin & Connelly, 1995; Meijer e al., 1999. Thus, there is no fixed list covering al the contents that TPK might involve, and such characteristics also render TPK tentative and dynamic along the journey of a teacher's professional development (Clandinin, 1985; Wei et l., 2022). Even so, previous studies seek to understand aspects of TPK Table 1 presents the five components involved in the examination of teachers' TPK, whereas i is suggested to see TPK either as content-oriented or learning-oriented knowledge (e.g., Chaharbashloo et al., 2020).

These aspects of TPK are interwoven in a pedagogical context. Therefore, a teacher's TPK can be thoroughly scrutinized in the events of his/her workplace (Grossman & Shulman, 1994) and in his/her practices, past experiences, present mind and body, and future plans and actions (Connelly et al., 1997). As such, a dual perspective of the person as ateacher" and \*the teacher as a whole person' (Farrll, 2022) matters, so that not only disciplinary knowledge but also personal and relective self can be explored.

# 2.2. AR: approaches and processes

Action research (AR) is a participatory procesconcerned with developing practical knowing in the pursuit of worthwhile human purposes. It sees to bring together action and reflection, theory and practice, in participation with others, in the pursuit of practical solutions to isues of pressing concern to people, and more generall the flourishing of individual persons and their communities (Reason & Bradbury, 2008, p. 4).

"As a practice for the systematic development of knowing and knowledge (Reason & Bradbury, 2008, p. 4), AR, in the field of education, is underpined by the ideas of "reflective practice" and \*the teacher as researcher (Buns, 2010, p. 2), so it is usually conducted by teachers,  who combine "action" and "research" through cycles (hereafter "AR cycles') of planning-action-observation-reflection (Burns, 2010; Kemmis & McTaggart, 1988) It typicall shows how teachers identify and solve the latent problems in order to improve their teaching practices and the whole curriculum in the long run (Burns, 2010).

AR is also areflective proces Burns, 2010. Since tchers are leson designers and practitioners the processof their dsign can e considered as their \*conversation with the teaching context (Schon, 1983). They start to interact with the teaching context according to their routine actions (i.e, their initial understandings and appreciations f it) (Farrll, 2022; Freman, 2016), and then resond to the back-talk from the teaching context (Schon, 1983, p. 79). Teachers therefore need to reflect on the construction of the problems and relevant strategie of action (Schon, 1983). Through reflection, they surfac r citicize the tacit understandings that they develop in their repetitive experiences; they also connect each teaching step with relevant theories, personal assumptions and actions. In this way, they can make new sense of the teaching context with uncertainties while preparing themselves for future cases with a more professionalized view of teaching (Burns, 2010; Farrell, 2022; Schon, 1983).

Therefore, the AR cycles are behavioural and reflective, typically involving five steps (see Table 2). They start with a teacher's routine actions (Step1) and the identification of \*surprises' as \*problems (Step 2), before the teacher refines the identified problems through reflections in the progress f reearch work (Stes 3-5) (see Altrichter et al. 208). However, this process ays more stress on actions than reflections, underemphasising the emotional and psychological aspect that brings personal feelings and experiences to the surface (Bs, 2010 p. 14). Ths t is elul t tteno ho mch reflectionan eexpaine, Farrll, 2022 thoughout the whole r, cosingth uday eh wft-iteftions: reftion-on-ctio i, rftin undrake er the action) (Dewey, 1933) and reflection-in-action (i.e., reaction undertaken during the action to guide further actions) (Schon, 1983)

Through the emotional and psychological explanation, we are in a better position to understand that reflection is not simple wondering about a situation but a rigorous form of evidence-based thinking with the aim of solving problems (Dewey, 1933; Schon, 1983). The explanation also encourage a tolerance of ambiguity and room for doubt or uncertainty because in teaching there might be no simple solutions or answers availale within a limited time (Farell 2022), and this helps to unveil anything to be improved" rather than \*problems to be solved" unil the end f the semester (se Step 5 in Table 2). Additionally, the explanation also matters to the way we perceive both teacheras-person" and "person-as-teacher (Farrll, 2022), so the possible objects of reflction need to include the tacit norms that underlie ajudgement, the strategies and theories implicit in the pattens of the teacher's behaviour, the feeling for a situation that leads to a particular action, the solutions sought to tackle the identified problems, and the role developed within such a context.

Undoubtedly, al of such reflections might not warrant an orderly understanding of what actuall happens to teachers, but narrative

$\diamond$ we will improve relevant plan(s) in the next semester when it comes to the end of the semester.

inquiry (Barkhuizen et al., 2014) can help to analyse and present the teacher's reflections in the form of stories. All the above supports our decision in the approach and design of research.

# 3. Methodology

As aforementioned, narrative inquiry is used to facilitate our understanding of TPK and reflection in this AR study. Narrative inquiry works with people's stories of experiences (i., experiences people have had in the past and imagine in the future) and uses narratives and stories as a means of exploring the content of the narratives (Barkhuizen & Consoli, 2021; Barkhuizen et al., 2014; Clandinin & Connell, 2000; Connelly & Clandinin, 990). As a constructivist-oriented qualitative research method, narrative inquiry explores people's experiences from their personal perspectives (Barkhuizen & Consoli, 2021; Clandinin & Connelly, 2000). Further. more regarding stories of experiences istemological heuristics, narrative inquiry not only serves to capture the complextie of the data (which might be rich, dynamic, messy, or unanticipated) but also helps to maintain the integrity and authenticity of people's voices with their idiosyncratic inricacies (Barkhuizen & Consoli, 2021). Narraive inquiry, therefore is the proper method to explore how the teacher reflected on her actions and (re)constructed her \*knowing" through analyzing her stories of experiences.

# 3.1. Research context and the participant

This study was conducted for one school year (i.e., 15 weeks/semester $^ { \ast } 2$ ) in a comprehensive university in the north of China, Where the EAP course aims to equip the students majoring in diverse disciplines to communicate appropriately as required in academic settings (Campion, 2016; Rosmawati, 2021). The EAP coursebook (i., Zhang & Wang, 2017) used at the university consists of 8 units with one academic focus in each unit (se details in Appendix 1), and all the texts come from academic articles. This course sets out to cultivate students awareness of rhetorical and generic expressions in academic setings, understandings of academic norms, and mastery of acadmic skill (ie., "academic focus" in the coursebook). It was required that allthe 8units should be taught within one semester. That is t say, within the school year (i.e., 2 semesters) when ths study was conducted, the EAP teachers taught the course twice (i., two rounds). The firt round of this course (Semester 1: 02-07/2020) commenced shortl after the outbreak of ovid-19,so it was conducted online where all the students atended virtual classes from their computers. The second round (Semester 2: 08-12/2020) was taught mainly in traditional offline classroms. The teaching materials used in Semestr 2,to some extent, were a repetition of those used in Semester 1.

The participant was the first author of this study, CB, who is an ELT teacher in the university and gained her Ph.D. in Education (specialized in applied linguistics) from an English-speaking country. With research interest in language teaching and teacher education, she has taught GE for over ten years, but it was her first time to teach EAP in Semester 1 of this study, when EAP became mandated in the ELT curriculum of the university. Therefore, Semester 1 marks daunting transition for CB and many of her colleagues from their familiar GE to EAP teaching.

In this AR project the other two authors of this study are two of CB's colleagues. As postgraduate supervisors, both of them have rich experiece iAP tchig nd chng, thrfore thy workd as fcilitrsofths projct ass t identify iues and move forward in the transition. Instead of providing CB with solutions directly, they encouraged her to make action plans and conduct self-reflections. To some extent, they created for CB a communit of practce with trust, support, and encouragement so that CB could have more confidence tocomplete theselfinquiry in this R processand liberate her ways of knowing eventually (Reason & Bradbury, 2008).

# 3.2. Data collection

In the process of data collction, CB provided the materials she used in the school year. These materials were categorized into two parts according to their contents: Part 1 were those related to Bs actions i teaching, whilePart 2 were 's reflections on her actions (see details in Table 3). The dat includedifferent forms of narrative (Barkhuizen et a., 2014), and each form involved various types: written (i.., notice,study guideline for a unit, reflective teaching journals, questionnaires, PowerPoint slides, ask-and-answer schedule, handouts), oral (i.e., interviews), and multimodal narraives (i.e., videos of CB's guidance for each unit). Among the three interviews, Interviews 1-2 were conducted by two of CB's colleagues, Yan and May (pseudonyms), when CB shared her teaching experiences with them. Interview 3 was conducted by the other two authors ofthis study. They assisted CB to conduct series ffurther self-reflections on some detail n the AR proces e., they asked B to evaluate her eformance in the transition on the whole and to clarify some details in her teaching actions and reflections shown in the data, which eventually led to CB's conversations" among different selves, collaboratiely gudd CB to summarize the theme diussed the dtils n expressions (g, in 4.3.1, whther to use "conversation' or interaction', etc.), and confirmed CB's final interpretations. Hence, Interview 3 was more of a democratic nego. tiation than an interview.

In order to clearly indicate the same type of data from different semesters, $^ { \circ } \mathbf { S } +$ number of the semester' was adopted. For example, "Questionnaire (\$2) rfers to the questionaire collected in Semester 2. fthe dat of the same type were from the same semester, they were marked with $^ { \mathrm {  } } \mathrm { \mathbf { S } } +$ number of the semester $^ +$ sequence of collection'. For example, both "Questionnaire (S1-1)" and "Questionnaire (S1-2)' were from Semester 1, but the former was collected earlier than the latter.

# 3.3. Data analysis

To show the authentic process of CB's EAP teaching, this study analysed the data within each theme chronologically with a "narratie grid" as its guideline (se Fig. 1). The "narrative grid" was designed with reference to Bao (2017), which draws on Bar khuizen and Wette's (2008) narrative frames, Clandinin and Connelly's (2000) framework of three-dimensional narrative inquiry space, and Dewey's (1938) theory f experiencecontinuity and interaction. There are three ifferences etween the narrative frame (Barkhuizen & Wette, 2008) and the narrative grid (Bao, 2017). First, narrative frame is used for multiplecases, while the narrative grid is for  single case. Second, the narrative frame is for data collction, whereas the narrative grid can be used as a way of research design and a method of data analysis. Third, in the narrative frame, researchers design themes in advance to scaffold participants narraives; in the narrative grid, rearchers discover themes (i.e, themes and subthemes in Fig. 1), which might be the results of thematic analysis in a deductive and/or inductive way (Bao, 2017).

Whereas the data within a specific row acros different columns (e.g., 1D to 3D) present the development or comparison of a specific subtheme.

To analyse the data, thematic analysis (Barkhuizen et al., 2014) with an iterative process was conducted both deductively and inductively. The deductive analysis was based on the framework of the AR cycles (., procedural steps from A to M in Table 4) and the knowledge about "disciplines" and "classoom management' in TPK (i.e, Themes 1 & 2, the two main themes in Table 4), because "what/how to teach and how to manage the classroom" not only explicity indicate the starting points that a teacher has to consider in practice but also implicitly integrate a teacher's knowledge about self, contexts, and students. In this sense, the two main themes could be counted as the outcomes of both deductive and inductive analysis. Within the two main themes, the details in each procedural step to solve the problems were inductively derived from our data. The "starting point", \*revised plan" and further revised plan" were taken as the outsets of the three cycles respectively, indicating a turning point (e.g, choices of teaching materials, strategies of classrom managment, et. f the actions B took to reach  solution (Schon, 1983). Then the details of al the themes were presented in narrative grid (see Table 4) for further interpretation and discussion.

# 4. Findings and discussion

# .1. Actions and reflections in selecting teaching contents and strategie:

The results show the development of CB's TPK about disciplines, demonstrating her understanding of the EAP course, the selection of teaching contents and strategies (Chaharbashloo et al., 2020; Wei & Lu, 2022), and the balance she sought to strike between language and content (Atai, Nazari, & Hamidi, 2022; Campion, 2016), official curriculum and students' expectations.

# 4.1.1. Cycle 1: "Teaching is like cooking"

Following the coursebook and the officia curriculum, CB took routine actions (Farrll, 2022; Freeman, 2016) to start her EAP teaching journey, conducting a language-driven instruction (Richards & Pun, 2021) as she did in GE teaching (i.e., focusing on students' mastery of the vocabulary, abilit of analysing the complicated sentences and understandings of the texts in the coursebook). Although she knew it was not the best choice, it was a temporarily "safe" way when she had no relevant prior experience of EAP teaching. She compared such a starting to a way of cooking:

To teach new course i like to create a new dish; we, the teachers, are like new coos then. We don't know what the real tast of the dish willbe;, what we only know i the ingredients (i.e., curiculum) the dish should contain. However, we have to start to cook immediately. So, we use the materials at hand and employ our common sense to cook something with our most familiar methods. Then we, together with our students, tast the dish and negotiate about what (e.g lavorings, sesonings or food colourings) should be added, removed or reduced, or about whether we should change a cooking method. After rounds of rial, we can make the dish close to our taste graduall. (CB's Interview 1)

Unit 1 was just the initial \*dish CB cooked It was not incident that \*the dish tases not good" as described in her students' feedack that "EAP is toodifficult' (1D in Table 4). Students' feedback evoked CB's memory of the first semester when she studied abroad: T knew every word, but I could not sense the meanings when these words were put together' (CB's TJ 1). Then came the irs time CB reflected on the teaching contents:

Is it really necesary for students to analyse the structures of the sentences or to memorize the vocabulary from the academic papers beyond their majors? My answer, perhaps, is "no". (CB's TJ 1)

Henceforth she readjusted her teaching plan, turning her attention to academic focus f each unit; then content-driven instruction (Richards & Pun, 2021) was planned.

4.1.2. Cycle 2: "Academic focus" in each unit was worth more attention

From Unit 2, CB turned to content-driven instruction (Richards & Pun, 2021), emphasizing students' understanding of the "academic focus' in each unit, the texts were used as tols to scaffold students' mastery of the academic sils. She thus made some supplementary teaching materials (e.g., Videos of Guidance for Each Unit) to support students to learn flexibly and designed some assignments for students' academic practices (e.g., academic writing, 3-min academic presentation, etc.).

To confirm students' mastery, she monitored each student's progress by providing as many rounds of feedback as possible before students submitted the final version of thir writing, as her Ph.D. supervisor did (CB's Interview 1). She also encouraged each student to make a video of a 3-min academic presentation to attend the contest held at the universty. It was surprising that five of my students won the prizes in the final contest" (CB's Interview 1). Such process gradually woke up CB's past self who had studied abroad many years ago, so she was eager to transplant her experiences into her personal teaching. Then what she did for her students was, to some extent, the outcome of the "conversation' between her present and past selves:

I understand what students need when they start to set fot i academic etigs. I am really eager to support them to master relevant essential skills so that they will not experience the same difficulties as I did before. (CB's Interview 1).

CBs such endeavours eventually won the students positive feedback, as one of her students wrote, This is the first time for me to find English is so charming and useful." (1H in Table 4), which further confirmed CB's belief that this was a proper way to go in the following semesters (1I in Table 4).

1.1.3. Cycle 3: Many materials in our daily life can be used in EAP course

Cycle 3 was conducted offline in Semester 2, therein came a new group of students. With the accumulated experiences from Se. mester 1, CB held a clear teaching aim: tocultivate students academic skill by doing as what scholars do. She not only continued to use the teaching materials and tass in Semester 1; she also employed various supplementary teaching materials from daily life (e.g, games, interesting videos, stories, etc.) to create a relaxing atmosphere (see an example in Appendix 8) and used aprepared video to show how to retrieve information from multiple academic resources so as to help the students transition from GE to EAP psychologically and technically. As CB said,

We should think about what our students can take away from our EAP course that willbenefit them. Personall, a way of thinking and some useful tools ... (CB's PPT 29)

# 4.2. Actions and reflections in classroom management

The results show the development of CB's TPK about classrom management, revealing her understandings of how to control the classroom, atract students atention, and manage time (Chaharbashloo et a., 2020. Interwoven with the changes in B's selection of teaching contents, the way she managed her classroom also relates to the three cycles along the AR process.

4.2.1. Cycle 1: Was the teacher-centred method a good choice?

Since CB started her EAP teaching as her routine actions in teaching GE, she habitually adopted instructed second language acquisition (ISLA) (Spada, 2021) to create a teacher-centred clsroom, expecting the students to follow her together online during class time (2C in Table 4).

However, she gradually realized that this strategy did not work in such a virtual lasroom, because it was not only dificult to require allthe students to study together conscientiously online but aso impossible for the students to master the academic skills in class (2D in Table 4). Even if the students understood the literal meaning of the academic knowledge, they could not apply it in practice. If this were not to change, both she and her students would be trapped in frustration (CB's TJ1). Her feeings then resonated with students' feedack (1D in Table 4). She could not help asking herself, \*f I were astudent, which method would be more suitable for me?" (2 in Table 4). Then she decided to change the way of classoom management, trying to create a student-centred space (CB's TJ 1).

4.2.2. Cycle 2: Was the student-centred method a better choice?

To shifther virtual classoom into a student-centred one, CB decided to use a task-based language teaching (TBLT) method (Spada 2021) (2F in Table 4) to correspond to the turning point of her teaching focus (1F in Table 4). With TBLT, students were able to manage their time and plan flexibly to complet each task before the deadline, and the teacher acted as an asstant to the student, offering help or support when needed (Samuda, 2001). To do this, CB prepared a lis of tasks of each unit as well as some references and suggestions for each task (2G in Table 4: see an example in Appendix 3) and also set up an \*"ask-and-answer schedule" (see Appendix 5) in case her students might need support. She had expectations for he students that Do not tell me you have understood (the academic skills) us show me you have understood (2I in Table 4; CB's TJ 2). Eventually, not only didall of the students complete the tasks on time, but the quality of their completed tasks exceeded CB's expectation (CB's TJ 2).

4.2.3. Cycle 3: Both teacher-, and student-, centred spaces were important

One of my teachers once told me: "For a teacher, teaching means that teaching what you know explicitly as well as what you are implicitly. (CB's Interview 3)

With such encouragement from her teacher and the experiences from Semester 1, CB firmly believed that teaching the explicit EAP knowledge was as important as working with students in the way of doing academic research; students' academic habits could be cultivated implicitly when they interacted with EAP teachers. Therefore, when the EAP course returned to the traditionaloffline classrom in Semester 2, CB took advantage of both ISLA and TBLT. The former was used in th offline teacher-centred classom to ehance the efficiency of teaching, whereas the latter was implemented after clas with tasks similar to those in Cycle 2 to create a student-centred space (2K in Table 4). As expected, the students attained the aims of this course satisfactorily (2L in Table 4).

# 4.3. Overall discussion

According to the analysis along the move in the three cycles when CB transitioned from GE to EAP, we saw the way CB developed her TPK in her changes in the selection of teaching contents and strategies and the way of classroom management. Such changes semed to e the utoes ofthe ntion btwe and he conxts , stdents, fficil curric onin  offline teaching modes, etc.) (Clandinin & Connelly, 1995; Schon, 1983; Wei et al., 2022).

However, the elicited data implied that each plan CB made together with relevant actions was an empathy design correlated with the "conversation" among CB's present, past, and imagined selves (see Fig. 2) (Connelly et al., 1997), and each self was embedded in one or more roles she (re)constructed in such \*onversation" process(Schon, 1983): the role of her \*ast elf were a GE teacher and a student who once studied abroad (e.g., \*when I was a student", "one of my teachers told me", etc.); the role of her \*imagined self' consisted of her students (e.g., \*if I were a student', etc.) and an ideal EAP teacher in her mind.

CB's different selves not only shared experiences but also held expectations together for her imagined self and the students. These experiences and expectations worked on her plans and actions collaboratively and led to the eventual conversation between CB and her students, which not only resonates with Connelly et al.'s (1997) opinion that a teacher's TPK could be scrutinized in her pat experiences, present mind and body, and the future plans and actions but also demonstrates CBs knowing-in-action during the process of GE-EAP transition.

# 4.3.1. The "conversation" among CB's different selves

The "conversation' among CB's diffrent selves developed her empathy for the students and provided her with a pool of mastery experiences (which might be successul or lead to failure) (Bandura, 1997) for her plans and actions, especially at the outset of each cycle. With the AR oing on, we could notice uch expressins as "t was surprising that ..\* (.), if I were a student..\* (4.1) .. exceeded CBs expectation (4.2.2) and \*as expected (4.2.3). These expressions implied the expectations from CB both as a person and as a teacher, which supported her in geting close to her imagined self as an ideal EAP teacher. In light of her previous experience as a student, she expected her students to learn in a relaxing and joyful atmosphere. As a teacher, she firmly believed that "only when the teacher enjoys her teaching wholeheartedly wil the students enjoy her lessons passionately' (CB's Interview 3). Therefore, she was committe to inovating teaching methods to engage and motivate her students to learn. In this proces, she created an imagined self as an ideal EAP teacher, striving to approach the ideal image in her mind.

# 4.3.2. The "conversation"' between CB and her students

The "conversation' between CB and her students was also based on CB's empathy for her students as a whole person (Burns, 2010, Farrel, 2022). In the teacher-as-person aspect, the relationship between CB and her students was dynamic. As non-native English speakers, both CB and the students treated the course of GE from an eti perspective, which means allof them learned some knowledge of a foreign language together from various sources rather than from personal experiences. In contrast, in the course of EAP, CB had already gained sufficient experience of doing academic research so she was able to act as an academic practitioner from an emic perspective. For example, she could share her experiences or lessons with her students, guide students to familiarize themselves with academic settings and help students to avoid potential pitfalls.

In the person-as-teacher aspect, moreover, CB expected her students to be excellent EAP learners as well as practitioners, advocating that EAP not only transmits linguistic knowledge required by aspecific academic context but also involves the social processes in the academic settings (Hyland & Hamp-Lyons, 2002). Such expectations evoked CB to teach EAP in the way of doing academic research. For example, CB occasionally assumed the role of a scholar, treatig her students as colleagues, communicating ideas and negotiating pedagogies. She sometimes followed the example of her own Ph.D. supervisor (4.1.2) and encouraged her students to work through their confusions (Schon, 1983) (4.1.2; 4.2.2; 4.2.3). In turn, students' fedback and performance further strengthened her self-efficacy beliefs (Bandura, 1997; Bao et al., 2021), allowing her to revise plans and apply them in an ongoing process.

# 4.3.3. CB's knowing-in-action

CB's "conversations" with her diffrent selves and students, to some extent, revealed how her knowing-in-action (Schon, 1983) worked in this AR process. Most of her knowing-in-action came from her personal mastery experiences (including those led to both success and failure) (Bandura, 197), supporting her to complete the AR process For example, when the AR process started, her nowing from the past self as aGE teacher endowed her with courag to start her routine action (Farrll, 2022; Freman, 2016): even if "we dont know what th real taste of the dish will be" (se details in 4.1.1) t las she held a basic knowledge of "cooking", although she was unaware of the knowing then. During the AR proces, her knowing from the past self as a student inspired her to respond to the "back-talk" from the teaching context (Schon, 1983, p. 79): whenever some problem emerged, she frequently thought of her empathy with students e.g. f I wr student) s a guidancoredesin hr furthr teaching. In retrn, students positie fback and good performance brought her a sense of achievement, which further aded to her mastery experiences that would be transformed into her knowing-in-action for the future (see details in 4.1 and 4.2).

![](img/f02b8b767fa3871af6befbc3bcbfa8a79a267ff85a20d524b3d3322bbd443516.jpg)  
Fig. 2. The way CB developed her TPK.

Theoretically, the way CB's knowing-i-ction worked also echoed positive psychology (Ba et al., 2022; Dewaele et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2023). According to the findings, most of CB's knowing-in-action used in this AR proces originated from her positie experiences. Such positive experiences strengthened her selfefficacy (Bandura, 1997) and enhanced her teaching grit so that she could attain work engagement with persistence (see the AR cycles in Table 4), active involvement (e.g., Learning by doing with the teachers support: see 2M in Table 4) and job-related satisfaction (e.g., It was surprising that five of my students won the prizes in the fial context": see details in 4.1.2) (Bao et al., 2021; hang et al., 2023). Therefore, she was capable of making effortsto turn the daunting transition into a positive process by creating a positive teaching-learning environment where students could develop positive individual traits and gain positive experience as well e., EAP was useul. Students could learn it btter and more easily if the teachers could use proper teaching materials and introduce EAP knowledge in arelaxing way.":see 1M in Table 4) (Bao et al., 2021; Dewey, 1916). These effrts eventually led her teaching into a virtuous circle and led her mind and spirit to be liberated as well (Reason & Bradbury, 2008)

# 5. Conclusions and implications

Through action research, we show that the participant was empowered in her struggle with the transition to EAP teaching with the components of TPK as a guidance. Such empowerment enabled her to become an active agent in the changes and implement the accommodatig trategie for the EAP curriculum and students. The empowerment was also sen in her fforts not only to accumulate EAP-related experiences and bring forth creative ideas based on an empathy design but also to carry them out in her teaching.

Since this study employed a single case, the findings cannot be generalized. As an AR project, this study is not formulaic but contextbound (Marshall & Reason, 1993). However, the findings and the analytical framework of this study still provide practical, thoretcal, and methodological implications not only for "'me" (i.e., CB) but also for "us" (i.e., those who are wresting with the hurdle of transitioning from GE to EAP) and for \*them'" (i.e., those whether inside, on the margins of, or outside this community of practice) (Marshall & Reason, 1993; Reason & Bradbury, 2008). As Reason and Bradbury (2008) said,

Action research does not start from a desire of changing others out there, although it may eventually have that result, rather it starts from an orientation of change with others. (p. 1)

At the practical level, the findings of "me" can provide "us" with some praxis. Specificall, the experiences shared by CB, an experienced EL teacher with a background of education in applied lingustics offer suggestions for pre-, and in, service AP teacher education/training courses as well as ongoing teacher-development efforts made by teachers themselves. On the one hand, if the practitioners have a knowledge of applied linguistics (e.g., second language acquisition, curriculum planing, etc.), the facilitaors should believe in the practitioners ability to find appropriate solutions, as the other two authors did in this AR project. What the facilitators may need to do is to create an environment of trust patience and support. On the other hand, if the practitioners do not have relevant knowledge or even may not have solid understanding of the freh approaches to teaching GE, the facilitators can try to activate the practitioners personal tacit and experiential knowledge (Chaharbashloo et al., 2020; Elbaz, 1981) and encourage the practitioners to interact with their teaching contexts (Schon, 1983). In this way, the practitioners can liberate their ways of knowing (Reason & Bradbury, 2008) and graduall figure out their unique paths toward their new abilites and better outcomes throughout the GE-EAP transitions. This proces aligns with the primary purpose of AR: to liberate the human body, mind and spirit in the search for a better freer world' (Reason & Bradbury, 2008, p. 5).

At the theoretical level, th findings of this study successully brought to the surface the emotional and psychological aspects of the participant's personal feelings and experiences (Buns, 2010). That i to say, the findings not only effctively connected and balanced \*actions" and \*reflections" in an AR process but alo harnessed the potentil of positive sychology in language learning and teaching (Bao et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2023). In addition, the findings also enriched some existing theories in applied linguistics (e.g., EAP teaching, tachers professional develoment, second language acquisition, curriculum planning, et.), and such eriched theries can be further applied by and for "us' and "them".

Such practical and theoretical implications, in turn, confirmed the values of this study at a methodological level: narrative inquiry is \*more thantelling stories" (Bell 2002 . 207). First as a person-centred tun of applied linguisics (enson, 2019), narrative inquiry advocates that humans should beseen as whole persons rather than as astractions or variables (Barkhuizen & Consoli, 2021). Second as arelexive tun in social science reeach (Archer, 2012; Foley, 2002), narrative inquiry promote the ned to mbrace relexivity and emphasizes that some important subjective elements are also necessary in research papers (Barkhuizen & Consoli, 2021; Rabbidge, 2017). In addition, this study used narrative grid (Bao, 2017) as its analytical framework, contributing to the methodological diversity and enriching the landscape of research methods used in qualitative studies.

# Box 1.Observation of CB's First Lesson

To introduce the usage of EAP with an academic thesis

Rather than teach the coursebook directly, CB firstly presented an outline of the whole coursebook together with her personal PhD thesis in order to show the students what a real academic thesis was like and to let the students know how the academic focus" of each unit could be used in academic writing.

# To introduce "definition'with a game

CB employed a game named who am $\mathbb { I } ? ^ { \ast } { } ^ { 1 }$ , which was also designed as a leadin section of Unit 1 to attract students' attention to its academic focus---definition.

The students played actively and happily. Nearly all the students started with the question $\mathbf { \hat { \rho } } _ { \mathrm { A m I } }$ a kind of fruit/animal...? and then to specify the characteristics of the item in their cards. When CB summarized the game, she asked students, \*Have you realized that you have already mastered the academic focus of Unit 1? The way you asked questions was exactly consistent with the structure of definition: term+ classification $^ +$ differentiating featuresZhang & Wang.2017,p.8).Then she explained the meaning of this structure.

Do you think it easy? Yes, EAP also exists in our life? She asked again. The students seemed to be enlightened suddenly.

Note: From CB's teaching video of the first lesson

1. The game "who am I?: Each student got a card with an item (e.g., a snowman, a tiger, etc.) on it, but he/she was not allowed to see it. In order to guess what the item in their personal cards. they were only permitted to ask yes-no questions.
