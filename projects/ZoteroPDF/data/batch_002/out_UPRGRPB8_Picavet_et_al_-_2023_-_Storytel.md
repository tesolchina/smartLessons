# ABSTRACT

This paper presents a framework for identifying and categorizing instances of storytelling in English lingua franca (ELF) higher education situations, based on a corpus of English Medium Instruction (EMI) engineering lectures in France. The lectures were delivered to international students at Master's level, by L2-English lecturers of mixed nationalities. This research draws on previous studies of oral narratives in general, and in similar academic contexts, to analyze the $^ \mathrm { 6 0 \ h }$ of video and audio recordings of the corpus. The framework outlines the identification, categorization and description of stories, with transcribed extracts from the corpus illustrating the categories. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the role played by storytelling in EMI-ELF courses and could benefit lec. turers themselves, but also students, institutions and their professional development policies.

# 1. Introduction

In higher education institutes of technology, lecturers of content courses (i.e., ll courses other than foreign language courses) commonly have professional experience in industry or research. To unpack what engineers truly do and think, many lecturers use narraives based on personal background and professional experience to complement or illustrate more traditional, bookish, or formalistic content. Thus, stories are a sign of professional competence (Dyer & Keller-Cohen, 2000).

In the wake of the Bologna Process of the late ${ } ^ { \mathfrak { s o o s } }$ and the creation of the European Higher Education Area, most European universities engaged in a large-scale internationalization of their curricula. As a consequence, many institutions moved from using a national language to aforeign language, mostly English, in course delivery. Such teaching is commonly referred to as English-medium instruction (EMI) and is done primarily by non-L1-English lecturers. Since the 200s, the vehicular language of EMI, or academic English asa Lingua Franca (L), has become a major subjet of reearch, allowing progres toward decriptive rather than prescriptive approaches (Jenkins, 2013, 2018). ELF is characterized by its divergence from the L1-English norm in the related linguistic fields of phonology, form, syntax, communication effectiveness. Moreover, the concept of a 'native speaker' is seriously challenged by both everyday usage and modern ELF research (Davies, 2003). Divergenceis becoming legitimized, as ELF is gaining its own idiomaticity (Bjorkman, 2013, pp. 57, 60-61), and this development impacts EMI in terms of learning outcomes as well as teaching practices.

# 1.1. EMI, engineering lectures and storytelling

When communicating science to nonexperts, Dahlstrom (2014) recommends the use of storyteling. A good story contextualizes content and encourages emotional connections, which may favor learning (McNett, 2016). Landrum et al. (2019) also emphasize the pedagogical power of storytelling' and advise implementing storytelling as an educational approach, praising it virtue in achieving desired learning outcomes. Fiall, Nesi and Alsop (2021, p. 25) found more frequent storytelling in experienced lecturers discourse, in both EMI andL1 contexts, when content was more complex and abstract. Further, they argue that sories help lecturersto make sense of their experience, and that narration meets psychological and cognitive needs, such as breaking from routine or building rapport.

Research addresses aspects of storytelling which are pertinent for EMI. For example, Alterio and McDrury (2003) promote it as a teaching and learning tool and encourage a 'storytelling culture in higher education. Andrews et al. (2009) go into more detail, identifying four story-based instructional methods: case-based (learner as an outside observer), narrative-based (learner within the narrato's context), scenario-based (leaner in an interactive, real-time experience) and problem-based (learner as the director of learning actvities). Considering the learner's perspective isaso important for Abrahamson (1998), who stresses the role of stories in reducing depersonalization and promoting critical thinking, and refers to them as the foundation of the teaching profession'. This may partly be due, as argued by Gibs (2014) to the way narratives give force to evidence, anchor experience in time, enable inferences, and favor appropriation of knowledge. Moreover, Gibbs highlights the way narratives contribute to the social transmission of experience (2014, p. 4). Finally, Martin observes the social dimension, noting that \*both discourses are social ones. They form community." (Martin, 2008, p. 53) and explains that storytelling complements traditional scientific lecture discourse.

# 1.2. Defining the terms 'story' and 'storytelling'

What is a story? According to Genett (1983, a story is an act or an event reported in text; i relates a transformation through time or the passage from a previous state to a resulting subsequent state. Labov and Waletzky's seminal work (1967) presents an analytical framework for the analysis of oral narratives of personal experience, defines the basic units of a narrative, and outlines its normal structure. What do stories do? For Bruner (1990), astory organizes experience and is roted in our ancient heritage. I appeals to the human organizational predisposition for the narratie form. We will use story' as an umbrell term todesignate story types and retan the following asic defintion of story  description f how something happened, [wll hapen, or could happen], that is intended to entertain people, and may be true or imagnryThetrmtrytllin wl deigat the act ftelling a story. Finll, anarrative is one of the six sub-categories of story types. All the stories referred to belong only to spoken discourse.

# 1.3. Building an analytical framework for studying storytelling

In this section, we build an analytical framework enabling the identification and categorization of potential stories. Alsop and Nesi explored storytelling extensively in their multinational Engineering Lecture Corpus (ELC) (Alsop, 2015; Alsop et al., 2013; Alsop & Nesi, 2014; Nesi et al., 2014), highlighting the fact that several classfications exist. These range from classical' Labovian Narratives (Labov & Waletzky, 1967) to Recounts, Exempla, Anecdotes (Martin, 2008), Story-Likes (Alsop, 2015), or Scenarios (Nesi & Alsop, 2021). Labov and Waletzky's definition of a narrative requires it to include a strict temporal sequence that can "recapitulate past experience in the same order as the original events". However, some researchers have found Labov's approach toonarrow or somewhat selective, and "an extremely problematic one" (Marti, 2008, p. 44). Martin proposes an extension of the notion of a single narrative structure by identifing four types of stories: 1. Recount, 2. Anecdote, 3. Exemplum, and 4. Narrtive. Alsop (2015) concurs that Labov's model is not full atsfactory and readily adopts Martin's approach (2013, p. 8-9). Nonetheles, to accommodate field data, Alsop added Story-likes', and Nesi and Alsop (2021) further added Scenarios (ee Fig. 1). These story types will now be defined.

Narratives, in the typical Labovian sequence, involve disturbed and restored equilibrium, and are broken down into six phases: an optional abstract, an orientation, a complication, a floating evaluation, a resolution and an optional coda. The Labovian analysis highlights how Narratives are constructed and the functions they perform. It also informs how narrators perceive, react to, or give shape to events, how they make a point; how they perceive themselves, or whether they recognize the conventions of storytelling. The evaluation element plays a major role:it tell the audience what the narrator feel about the events. It can add more evidence to the overall story and provide moral elements.

Three other types of stories (Anecdote, Exemplum and Recount) were proposed by Martin as an improvement to Labov's cass. fication. Martin argues that Labov standardized his corpus, narrowing the range of narrative functions and formats, by orienting participants to relate stories on a single theme and sometimes asking them at the end about what happened next (2008, p. 4). In Martin's clasification, Recounts narrate unproblematic events and take the form of running commentary. Anecdotes and Exempla narrate problematic events which are not resolved. Anecdotes tel of unexpected disruption generating emotional empathy, whereas Exempla deal with a noteworthy incident leading to moral judgement.

Alsop's Story-likes' deal with events that do not systematically belong to the past, ften having a present-continuous, or permanent character, yet are presented by the lecturer in a similar fashion to a Narrative (Alsop, 2015).

Finally, 'Scenarios' are defined as hypothetical events, when lecturers invite their audiences to imagine a fantastic hypothetical situation', in sequences in which they stray away from the delivery of facts \*into the realms of fantasy' (Nesi & Alsop, 2021, p.25)

![](img/d2bd4cd36f77d8726d5143597c740a3a9725941dc117f2e39e7df79646d16ce3.jpg)  
Fig. 1. The six story types and their features.

These authors report that \*scenario-telling is part of the experienced lecturer's repertoire and is an engaging way of elaborating ab. stract technical terms, concepts, or arguments central to a disciplinary topic'. Our accetation of the term scenario is broader than that of Nesi and Alsop, as it includes hypothetical events that are not fantastic.

# 1.4. Research questions

In response to Jablonkai's (2021) call for more EMI corpus research, notably using corpus linguistics methods to analyze educa tional and professional discourse in EMI contexts, we aim to build our own corpus to study storytelling. The objective is to find. delineate and categorize the stories that we hypothesize exist in engineering lectures delivered in English to international student audiences, by non-1-English lecturers in an institute of technology in France. Our study context is pedagogical situations specifi to a master's degree in Engineering (MEng). Therefore, we address the following research questions:

(1) How can stories and their boundaries be identified in EMI pedagogical situations? (2) How can the stories, once found, be categorized?

# 2. Method

# 2.1. Setting

Data was collected in an instite of technology in France because of its variety of international undergraduate programs. The institute comprises seven collees of various engineering ranches and a graduate school f management In 2021-2022, the instte rolle 900 students, ${ } ^ { 2 3 \% }$ of whom came from abroad. All lecturers in the current study work in one of these colleges, on degree programs in energy, civil and environmental enginering. In particular, these lecturers teach in three international MEng courses: Hydraulic and Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Fluid Mechanics and Energ ystems. The lectures are delivered in English, so the context can be categorized as EMI.

# 2.2. Participants

Fourteen MEng lecturer volunteered to participate in the study. Twenty-eight lectures were recorded in 12 diffrent engineering subjects $( 6 0 \mathrm { h } )$ . The lecturers span both sexes (three female and eleven male) and all categories of ages and experiences, from fledgling postdoctorl researchers and assistant professor, to accomplished associate professors or seasoned fullprofessors. Apart from two Italians and one Romanian, they were L1 speakers of French.

# 2.3. Data collection and transcription

This study examines storytelling instances found in the Corpus of French Enginering Lectures (CoEL), which comprise videos, sound recordings and annotated transcripts from ELF-EMI enginering lectures delivered to international MEng students, betwen fal

2019 and fall 2021. Initiall, the lectures were recorded using high-definition video cameras and sound recorders. However, from March 2020 on, due to the outbreak of the COvID pandemic in France, most courses were conducted via online platorms. Thus, the recording of lectures was done online, via the recording function available on those platorms. The consent of participants was always collected, both from teachers and students.

The ELAN (2022) annotation software was used to transcribe and annotate the audio and video recordings, mixing pragmatic annotation and discourse analysis methods. The video data helped to disambiguate some unclear audio passages, with accompanying gestures, facial expressions, chalk-board text, drawings, or slide-shows. The term annotation' is used for the identification of pragmatic categories, including storyteling. The transcription of the utterances into written text was done using the VOICE conventions (VOICE, 2007). The list of the main VOICE codes used for the CoFEL excerpts are shown in Table 1.

# 3. Identifying storytelling instances in CoFEL

Identifying storytelling instances in CoFEL involved three stages: (1) detecting typical morphosyntactic story markers in lexis   
tenses or personal pronouns; (2) locating shifs in stance, in the linguistic register or the pragmatic function; (3) determining the   
boundaries of a story, i.e, where a story begins and where it ends. Based on examples of tories in the literature, we selected search   
terms to identify passages in CoFEL that could potentially function as stories (Alsop, 2015; Alsop et al., 2013; Nesi & Alsop, 2021). Tiuntl. h1 1

In addition, we searched for words relating to incidents or accidents in the field of engineering (Table 3). Items from this lexical field are frequently found in engineering stories (Alsop, 2015). The canonical form of words (lemma) was used in the search, with a tolerance for all inflections of a given word (e.g., catastrophic', from catastrophe'). The search terms were:

Tenses other than the various present forms are strong indicators of the presence of a story in a lecture (Alsop et l. 2013; Nesi & Alsop, 2021). Thus, CoFEL was searched for the nine past, future and conditional auxiliaries isted in (Table 4), including two contracted forms frequently found in oral texts:

Moreover, by using peronal pronouns lecturrs address their student audiences directly, and therefore, may indicate the resencef stories. For Luukka (1992, p. 79-80), theI pronounsignals the resece ofthe lectrer, thecollctive you indicates the preence ofthe audience; we marks the presence of both; allof these are "signals of interactional atitudes". Thus, CoFEL was searched for the three pronouns I, you' and we. When the searches for lexis, tenses and pronouns pointed to the same passge, it was considered to be a candidate story for further analysis.

Secondly, we used Martin's model (2008,pp. 53-54) to locate shifts in stance, register or pragmatic function. Building on Bern stein's (199) work on vertical and horizontal discourse, the model lists types of shifts within discourse: from scientific to artistic, technical to aesible, logical to rhetorical, rational to humane, objective to subjective or institutional to local. A typical shift from exposition to narration is when lcturers move from preenting rational scitific data to an expriencd eallife situatio. Such ashit can be characterized by changes in physical, attitudinal or moral positioning (e.g., moving closer to the audience, looking for eye contact) and in type of discourse (e.g., from lecturing to building rapport, entertaining, telling historical facts or anecdotes, or attempting humor). Likewise, lecturers may interrupt the exposition of scientific content in order to invite students to imagine themselves in a real-life engineering situation. The first author earched through CoFEL (video, sound and transcripts) and identified such shifts from scientific discourse to discourse directly addressing the students.

Thirdly, we established the boundaries of the stories. We decided to include the lead of a story when it was essential to under. standing the overall story. I case of rater disagreement, we decided to set the boundaries so as to include the longer version of the story. Moreover, some stories contained one or several sub-plots. When a sub-plot was self-contained, we considered it a separate story. On the contrary, when several sub-plots were interrelated, they were taken together as one complex story. Some candidate stories were rejected outright, such as Example 1 which presents a condition (if you have'), but lacks even the rudiments of a plot:

so that's the correct idea. it doesn't really make sense to study the cases corresponding to: velocity which are beyond the: divergent velocity- right- because if you have already broken your: structure then you don't really matter- you don't really focus on the vibration of it. [20200117_FAC_SCEN_10]

To conclude, decisions about the inclusion of a candidate story were made by combining the three steps above. The next section examines how those instances of storytelling were categorized.

# 4. Categorizing storytelling instances into story types

An analysis grid was developed based on the literature and six types of stories were retained for their likely presence in EMI engineering lectures (Alsop, 2015; Labov & Waletzky, 1967; Martin, 2008; Nesi & Alsop, 2021). Fig 1 presents the grid, with specific features for each type, and shows how researchers have built on each other's work to enrich the story typology.

The three authors/raters independently categorized the twenty lecture passages containing candidate stories, and then they compared the results in a series of four rounds. Firstly, two more candidate stories were eliminated. Although they did contain some typical story markers for a Scenario as in the example below (we can imagine', 2nd line), the topic did not develop into a plot:

the sedimentary rock comes from deposits er of different materials, so we have er layers er: so: we can imagine that- that if we: load the layers er: er: perpendicular to the layers or on the axis of the layers we don't have the same characteristics, ok? [20200213_ELO2_SCEN_10]

Example 2. A candidate story (containing a Scenario marker) that was rejected.

Secondly, the raters agreed on eight of the eighteen remaining candidate stories: three Exempla, two Anecdotes, two Recounts and one Scenario. Two types were asent from this firs list: Narratives and Story-like. Thirdly, seven candidate stories on which two out of the three raters agreed were discussed. In most cases these candidate stories contained linguistic or semantic inaccuracies due to the use of a foreign language or to weak storytlling ailities. I some other cases, the decision involved discussing the application of the category definitions. For example, for one story, we decided that an object (an old farmhouse), rather than a person, could be the main character of a Narrative. Afer discussion, full agrement was reached on three Story-likes, two Anecdotes, one Narrative and one Scenario. Finll, the remaining three candidat stories were discussed. These cases also involved interpretation of the category definitions. For example, for one story, we decided that the UK government was the main historical character in a Recount. The final decisions were: one Exemplum, one Recount and one Story-like.

Thus, the corpus contains 18 stories: four Anecdotes, four Exempla, four Story-likes, three Recounts, two Scenarios and one Narrative. In the next section, selected storytelling excerpts from CoFEL willillustrate each of the six story types.

# 5. Exemplification of the typology: stories found in CoFEL

In this part, we comment upon sample stories found in CoEL. The lecture recordings were transcribed orthographically without modifying divergent morphosyntactic forms. The sign [.. indicates non-essential passages (repetitions, hesitations, ec. that have been abridged for the reader's convenience and lack of space. Titles have been given to stories for easier reference.

# 5.1. Narratives - The Drome farmhouse

A Narrative is defined by Martin (2008, p. 43) as the relations between events and feelings" this i th foundation of the structure, and function, of tories. A typical Labovian-Martinian narrative comprises six stages: Abstract (optional), Orientation, Complication, Evaluation (floating), Resolution, Coda (optional). We will use this firs sample from CoFEL to describe in detail each of these stages. All the excerpts in this part belong to the same corpus transcript (20200206_CAM2_NAR_10).

# 5.1.1. Abstract

This Narrative starts with an Astract, answering the question What is/was this about? (Gibbs, 2014). This provides a summary of the events or makes a general proposition, which the Narrative will exemplify. Although optional, this stage is present in the Soil & Rock Mechanics story below, as well as in most stories in CoFEL. The topic of this excerpt is the presence of water in soil, whether saturated or submerged, and its consequences:

a soil which is under the groundwater level do not have the same weight as the soil which on the top of the groundwater level. [...] i call it effective specific weight because it's something which [...] is equal to the saturated volumic weight minus the volumic weight of water. [...] ok? i'm going to give you a short example of why it is super important. (8) {lecturer is erasing chalkboard}.

Excerpt 1. Labovian Abstract example.

The lecturer treses the importance f considering the presence of water in soil for the constructio of houses or buildings, etting the theoretical backdrop for the 'short example' mentioned at the end of this first transcript, the story to come.

# 5.1.2. Orientation

The next stage, the Orientation, is indispensable and provides key information about the time, place, situation and participants of the Narrative. In the next excerpt, the date of the event is given, \*in August $2 0 0 3 ^ { \circ }$ , as well as the location at various levels of granularity, in France", \*in the departement (French for county' or district) called laDrome" (southeasten France) and "close to here'. As for th partcipant thre s friend of th trer, t the relet f thNarrtive,  house  ecmes aharacte n elf, with "an old house" and  farmer(s) house", the farmhouse. However, most f this Orientation is dedicated to the description of the event, of what happened there, while the ecturer i drawing arough cros-section sketch of the scene on the chalkboard. This part of the Narrative prepares the audience for the Complication that is to come, by building tension or expectation.

ok well i should tell you a story that i know because it took place where i have a friend which is living there. {lecturer is drawing on chalkboard} there are mountains. this is the bedrock. ok? and here this is filled with some (sediment) soil. ok? it's close to here. it's er in the department called la drome. ok? and here there is a house. it's an old house made of stone. [...er then if you have a motion there is no resistance to tensile (in fact). so this is why we can see a lot of old houses made of stone with big crack- vertical (crack). [...] this was a lake in many- (well) many years ago. there is still (2) a groundwater (2) table here. ok? and you know what happened in august two thousand and three in france? (you're) maybe a bit too young.

Excerpt 2. Labovian Orientation stage example.

# 5.1.3.  Complication

Following the Orientation comes the Complication -or Complicating Action- stage. This stage is also essential and represents the climax of the Narrative, as it introduces the series of events that build the action itself, the problem. It can involve cycles, turning points, crises or problems, and shows how they were dealt with In Excerpt 5 below, the lectrer decribes the heat-induced drought of that summer 2003 period (a climate situation where the temperatures were to high'), which provoked large cracks in many houses (you have cracks of $2 0 \mathrm { c m } ^ { \prime }$ ), due to the evaporation of the groundwater contained in sedimentary soils (the groundwater level moved down'), presumably under the influence of climate change: it was probably the first time in the history of this field'.

there was a climate er situation where the (standard) temperature were too high. ok? during all august. ok? so all the groundwater level moved down. ok? [...] er we don't know exactly maybe one meter something like that. ok? so what happened? what is the vertical stress that compress the soil which is here? it's the stress due to that soil which is let's say wet with a given specific weight and that soil which is saturated. [...] so let's say it is- it was here twenty kilo newton per meter cube and here it was er ten er kilo newton per meter cube. ok? [...] so the weight of this column of soil was higher due to the fact that the groundwater level moved down. so the soil which is under here was compressed by the weight that was higher. ok? so here it opened. and here {lecturer is pointing to the top of the farmhouse} you have cracks of twenty centimeters. ok? so the house was very close to- to crash.

Excerpt 3. Labovian Complication stage example.

# 5.1.4. Resolution

The Evaluation, Resolution and optional Coda stages come next. The location of the Evaluation is not fixed it can come before, after or coincide with the Resolution. In the excerpts below, it comes ater. As for the Resolution stage, it answers the question What finally happened? (Gibbs, 2014), thus describing the outcome of the events related in the Complication, or the solution of the problem It

serves as a conclusion to the Narrative. In Excrpt 7, the Resolution detil the rather far-reaching course of actions taken to deal with the issue at stake: the roof and part of the walls of the farmhouse had to be removed.

so to do that in fact they unbuild the roof. they removed half of the high of the- of the walls to reduce the weight. ok? and to- to preserve the- the farm.

Excerpt 4. Labovian Resolution stage example.

# 5.1.5. Evaluation

The purpose of the floating Evaluation stage is to highlight the significance, the meaning or point of the Narrative. Here, the lecturer broadens the pictre to the rest of the countr, a the historical drought that year provoked a general,nation-wide lowering of the level of groundwater tables and aquifers. The consequence for houses in many French regions was the appearance of sometimes serious structural cracks, when water evaporated and soils dried out and lowered.

but this was- there was a lot of situation like that in france in fact. there was a lot of houses where there was a lot of cracks that appears due to this specific er increase in the temperature due to the fact that the groundwater table moved down. ok?

Excerpt 5. Labovian Evaluation stage example.

# 5.1.6. Coda

As in music, an optional Coda can adorn the end of the Narrtive, matching the question And now? Its purpose is to mark the end of the Narrative and connct the tt the preen r some ther Narratie. ereth etr finishes by realling lr references in the lecture to Archimedes' principle (more commonly referred to as 'buoyancy' in English).

so this is due to the archimede(s) variation let's say of er the volumetric weight that changes due to archimede(s) force.

# Excerpt 6. Labovian Coda stage example.

This extended, ix-stage Narrative fits the \*familiar equilibrium disturbed, then equilirium restored motif (Martin, 2008, p. 43) rather well. the events are resoved at the end of the plot and the old, seriously endangered farhouse i salvaged, albeit at geat labor and cost, in the Resolution stage. The pedagogical potential of this story is high, as a cracked old farmhouse can be rather easily pictured by students. As successive stages of the story unfold, they may become slightly worried about the outcome: willthe house eventually collapse? Some might even sympathize with the "poor, old house, and be happy with the favorable outcome, especiall if they experiencd a similar situation themseles. The reference tthe beginning to afriend of the lecturer anchors the story in realit. The lecturer's appeal to the (too) young audience's own memory about the 2003 drought, in France, may work in asimilar fashion. There is some tension-building when the lecturer points at the gable end of the house on his drawing and evokes the enormous $2 0 { \cdot } \mathrm { c m }$ cracks thratening ts integity. The leturer-narrator give shape to theevent and ss himself as an expert in the domai, initing his audience to do the same. The rhetorical style may persuade current and future engineers of the need to take into consideration the nature of the soil in relation to climate change.

The next sample stories will be described using Labovian terminology, but none of them will be considered a Narrative, as explained.

# 5.2. Anecdotes - The untimely airbag

Martin (2008, p. 44) maintains that Anecdotes and Exempla are stories that contain an event that is problematized, but not resolved. Alsop (2015) specifies that the distinction is made at the level f reaction: Anecdotes elicit emotional empathy, whereas Exempla licit moral judgment. From a cultural viewpoint, Alsop found that UK-L1 speakers of English in the ELC often have recourse to the type, more than L2 speakers. Moreover, although Anecdotes may have quite serious topics, \*the costs of the described complications are not grim and/or do not have serious/negative consequence" and they \*introduce concepts in an entertaining and memorable way, rather than in elaborate or technical detail' (2015, p. 268).

The Anecdote reported below, from a ower Electronics lecture, corresponds to the above description: potentially serious incidents in a German car, due to the untimely inflating of airbag cushions. We categorized it as an Anecdote, not an Exemplum, as although it could have had serious consequences (e.g, a car accident), none are reported. There is no moral judgement' either, contrary to the Exemplum about a burst dam described in the next part.

# 5.2.1. Abstract

ok er electromagnetic compatibility can be separated into emission and susceptibility. the emission represents the capability that the electrical device has to disturb some electrical equipments and this disturbance can be achieved through either the wires- that's conducted emission- or through the air- through electromagnetic wave which is er radiated emission. on the other hand the electronic devices can be disturbed through either the wires- that's conducted susceptibility or through the electromagnetic waves- that's radiated susceptibility.

# 5.2.2. Orientation

so this er science of electromagnetic compatibility started in the late eighties er: or a bit earlier in the seventies er because of the first disturbance which were er encountered by people.

# 5.2.3.  Complication

of course the world becomes more and more electrical and more and more electronics and we had a lot of er new issue er which (have) been er- er reported in the literature. er i told you already i think that er a german car had a lot of safety airbag(s) and when you turn your light(s) on er it generate(s) the- the starting of the airbags $\mathbf { \Pi } ( \ @bar { \omega } )$ which is of-obviously very er uncomfortable for the driver.

and that was er due to the proximity of two wires too close together. the wire of the sensors of the airbag and the wire of the light(s).

Excerpt 7. Anecdote example (20210104_SAJ_NAR_20).

This Anecdote opens with an abstract exposing general-purpose definitions and remarks on the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of electronic devices. It is delivered in a light-hearted manner, with a humorous twist to it (the starting of the airbag (.. is obviously very uncomfortable for the driver), as a car cannot be driven with inflating airbags. This Anecdote example lacks a resoution tage, a shared fetre with Exempla Like the precdig Rcount, itillstrates the pedagogical ottil of stories rather el it is anchored in time (in the seventies); it relates to commonly shared objects and knowledge (a car' as a vehicle and airbags' as standard equipment in all modern cars), it inerts situational humor into the lecture, perhaps to provide a brief, light-hearted interlude during an otherwise serious lecture.

# 5.3.  Exempla - The Malpasset Dam disaster

Exemplum i one of Martin's four story types (2008), reporting on noteworthy incidents and entailing a moral judgement. In both the ELC and CoFEL corpora, that notion of judgement extends to matters which are scientific. In this type of tory, lecturers tend to use longer strings of text, giving a greater wealth of detail, perhaps driven by the compelling concluding judgment of a serious incident or catastrophic disaster. The events reported in the type contain complex or far-reaching complicating action' stages. Moreover, such events spur major changes in engineering techniques or approaches. Classical themes developed in those stories include financial or health-and-safet responsibilit. Akeyword analys shows that Exemplaae lcated wheeengineering structures are built o operated staging \*scenes in which the themes of death and mutilation are trongly linked to situations in which students may find themselves during their uture careers (Alsop, 2015, p. 264) It could be argued that lecturers use the Exemplum type of story to help students to picture themselves in a professional position, with great responsibility for themselves, their teams, or populations in general.

The lecture excerpt below is about the catastrophic dam burs at Malpasset, i southeastern France. The Malpasset Dam was an arch dam on the Reyran River, located a few kilometers north ofFrejus, on the French Riviera. t collapsed in Decmber 1959, killing over 400 people in theresulting flod and causing damage estimated at 56 millon (Us\$68 millon). This lengthy story is presented using the standard Labovian breakdown to make it easier for the reader to grasp. However, its dramatic content, the fact that it set a landmark for major changes in rock mechanics approaches and led to the learning of lessons for future engineering projects does categorize it as an Exemplum.

# 5.3.1. Abstract

so rock mechanics is a quite young science and er: events in the sixties er highlight the lack of knowledge on rock mechanics and er because of a lot of large works that was built in the post war investment plan. [...] so one of the event is the malpasset dam failure.

# 5.3.2. Orientation

so mal- malpasset dam is an arc(h) dam that was built er by er andre coyne which was a famous engineer in the dam design. [...] so at this period er it was because a lot of dams that was built. it was a period of improvement on the design method and the arc(h) dam was thinner and thinner and the malpasset dam was really thin. [...] the aim of this dam is the water supply of frejus and saint raphael- the two towns in the south east of france. [...] the end of the building of malpasset dam was in nineteen fifty four. [...] one of the problem yes was that there weren't rains enough and really less than the one that was expected when they designed the volume of the water storage. so the level of the lake was quite low. [...]

# 5.3.3.  Complication

and during december nineteen fifty nine er there were a lot of intense rainfalls and so the level grew up really fast and er: reached the: highest level of the dam. and unfortunately er: with this high level of water er the dam collapsed and especially on the left part of the dam. and millions of cube meter flew on the downstream of the dam and er: there were a lot of damage on roads- railways- building(s)- and there were more than four hundred er deaths in frejus and saint raphael.

# 5.3.4. Resolution

er after this failure er there were a lot of studies to: explain what happened. and the conclusion of this study was that there were a problem on the: foundation on the rock mass on the left bank of the dam. er there was a large fault that was not expected when the dam was built. [...] so then er the block on which the dam was er founded er slided and then failed. so all the water could er get out of the dam on the downstream part of the dam.

# 5.3.5. Evaluation

so at this period techniques to er: investigate the rock mass before building any dam were not really developed and er: the focus was more on the structural design of the dam than on the foundation characteristic of the rock mass.

# 5.3.6. Coda

so after this disaster er: there were a lot of studies on the rock mass characteristics and a lot of improvement in the investigation techniques er especially to know the characteristic of deep part of the rock mass. and today er in such situation the fault of malpasset would have been known before building the dam.

Excerpt 8. Exemplum example (20210210_ELO_NAR_20).

In recounting the dreadful Malpasset disaster at length, the civil-engineering lecturer may be atempting to impress an ingenuous student audience and to convey a powerful sense of responsibility for the future decisions and actions. There is a clear moralizing intention, as the engineers of the time did not have the knowledge necessary to detect the presence of an underground rock fault, with dramatic, far-reaching complicating consequences and hundreds of casualties (today [..] the fault of Malpasset would have ben known before building the dam). The lecturer highlights the potentially horrfic consequences of a lack of expertise or preparation on the part of professionals. The story also insists on the rock mechanics experience acquired in the aftermath of the disaster (afer this disaster, there were a lot of studies on the rock mass characteristics and a lot of improvement in the investigation techniques). This is another typical feature of Exempla: explaining how dramatic events may trigger major changes in the field.

# 5.4. Recounts - The Seven Bridges of Konigsberg

Recounts tend to be straightforward and rather concise, usually containing neither complication nor resolution. This story type is meant to be informative, chronological and merely descriptive ofa series of events with which the lectrer will usually kep a distance. Martin states that the Recount type depicts unproblematic events', in a running commentary' (Martin, 2008). In Alsop's definition (2015, p. 259), the lecturer-engineer \*conveys information about events in the past in chronological order'. The type is characterized by any combination of the three basic components (places: Where? - people: Who? - enginering structures: What?) and Alsop insists on the frequent presence of renowned historical personalities.

Excerpt 9 is a clear example of the Recount category, as it matches the criteria above perfectly. It invokes the famous 18th-century Swiss polymath, Leonhard Euler. Euler made influential discoveries in many branches of mathematics, such as ininitesimal calculus or graph theory. As such, Euler fits rather wel in the major historical name (Who?) category. Likewise, engineering structures are referred to, here the "Konigsberg Bridges" (What? - Where?). They are invoked more as a well-known mathematical problem (known as \*The Seven Bridges of Konigsberg) than for their structural design. The city of Konigsberg in Prussia (Kaliningrad, in today's Russia) was established on the Pregel River over two large islands. These were connected to each other and to the mainland portions of the city by seven bridges. The problem is to devise a pathway through the city that crosses each of those bridges once and only once. In the example below, the lecturer addresses the isue of the complex management of the electrical-power grid through modern computer science, a metaphor derived from Euler's graph theory. This is acknowledged in the second paragraph.

complex networks is an evolution of the graph theory. er all of you know er graph theory er that is starting from leonhard euler when he had to solve the problem of konigsberg bridges. er: is he able to go to every part of the city er going through one bridge only. in fact he built a mathematical theory around it just to prove that it was impossible. this is what we did use er till nineteen sixty with random graph theory. somehow we had a lack of er- interest in graph theory just because the problem were becoming larger and larger and we didn't have the er- let's say- the computation ability to solve them.

and so in parallel we need to add a new field that is computer. and thanks to the er big database the er processing power that was increasing more and more. in fact complex network theory appears er in the late nineties with small world networks and scale free networks. and this complex network theory er was really helpful for instance to study er typically social medias and pandemic situation.

Excerpt 9. Recount example (20200820_PAC_NAR_30).

Excerpt 9illustrates the didactic value and pedagogical potential of stories for thre reasons a) it provides chronological anchoring (till 1960'); b) it contextualizes knowledge and experience (Euler's graph theory evolving into modern complex networks, with the development of computer science); c) the metaphor (bridge route/complex networks) is likely to stick with the students, to favor new knowledge appropriation, with an emphasis on problem-solving.

# 5.5. Story-likes - The Bubbles (a cable-car)

According to Alsop (2015, Chapter 7.4.5), the pertinence of Story-likes to engineering domains i that they directly orient towards the future: these quasi-stories act as an invitation to learn and join the engineering community. Dealing with unreal events like Scenarios, they differ from them by using hypotheses or plausible predictions, not purely imaginary, fantastic conceptions. Lecturers do this with caution, awarenes and scientific judgement, considering the huge responsibility that designing and building a dam, a nuclear-power plant or a cantilever bridge represents. Alsop argues that Story-likes enable lecturers to embrace their expert roles vicariously acting as mediators between the lay and professional world. Scientific and engineering knowledge is made accessible and young aspiring professionals are more likely to remember the content.

This excerpt does not qualify as a Narrative, because of its dominant present and future tenses, permanent character, and directaddress to audience style, with numerous personal pronouns (th transcript below maps the distribution of personal pronouns , you' and we', showing their rather high density). Yet, the excerpt breaks down - imperfectly - into a Labovian structure and is thus a legitimate Story-like. We segmented parts of the excerpt using the Labovian approach, for the reader's convenience. We also introduced three extraneous stages, Questioning, Humor and Exemplifying, to describe non-Labovian strings of text.

# 5.5.1. Abstract

er so one thing that can be interesting when you make surveys is to extract the soil to identify the different soils. [...] also because depending on the distance between the ground and the bedrock you can then select the kind of foundation that you can use for er- for your building.

# 5.5.2. Questioning

do you have an idea of the distance between our feet and the bedrock?

# 5.5.3. Orientation

[...] here we have two river(s). we have drac over there we have isere over there. the level is not the same. so drac is higher than isere. so there is a flux of water from one river to another one. this clean everything. ok? [...] [we have some er- we] have some clean gravel and after in fact we have big layers of silt and (clays). ok?

# 5.5.4. Questioning

do you have an idea of what there was here in that valley many many MANY years ago? [...]

# 5.5.5. Complication

yes there was some ice (4) it dig the rocks ok? [...] after everything melt there was some lakes and so on ok? so there was a deposit of sediment ok? this is why we have a lot of clay ok?

# 5.5.6. Questioning

do you have an idea of what we have here under our feet?

# 5.5.7. Humor

so $\sharp$ would suggest something. if you don't like sport you go to bastille with the bubbles {lecturer imitates sound of cable car going up} you climb up and you move down by walking. it's more easy than the opposite (actually). {SS: @@@}

# 5.5.8. Resolution

and when $\boxed { \mathrm { y o u } }$ will move down you will see that there are big panels that explain the geological context of the site. ok? and you will see that in the eighties they make a big survey close to the campus to see where is the bedrock. six hundred meters. ok? so we have something four hundred meters- or maybe more- five hundred meters of clay- silt and afterthe last meters- it's gravel and so on. ok?

# 5.5.9. Exemplifying

so for example when (they built the synchrotron [...] this is typically a building that you don't want any motion of the soil because if the electrons at three thousand kilometers go outside the ring we can have problems. so they made a very important survey concerning the soil and studying everything and they- in fact all the building is build on jack [...] to correct everything to be sure that if it moves [...] all the electrons are going in the good direction.

# 5.5.10. Evaluation

so it's very important to identify everything and to have a first idea of what is the site. [...] ok?

xcerpt 10. Story-lik example: a Illstrationof similrty of some non-Narrative tex strinsto th Labovia stucture. b) Mapping of prsona Jronouns I, you' and 'we'. (20200206_CAM_NAR_10).

Using a finer-grained analysis, it becomes apparent that by using the present or future tenses, the lecturer sems to relate content directly to the students' own knowledge, interests or environment. Analogy or direct reference are used, rather than hypothesizing or theorizing, e., the passage and when you will moe down sic, you will se hat ." found in the Rotion section f the trancript. Like for Alsop (2015), in CoFEL sub-plots or sub-stories are sometimes embedded in the larger self-contained Story-like, as in this example (Section 5.5.9). These can even be shorter, real' stories in which past tenses are used, such as in the Questioning-Complication, or Exemplifying, stages.

The strong interactional appeal is also evident in how the lecturer addresses the students in a very direct manner. For example, within the 681-word excerpt the lecturer uses the personal pronouns you (20 occurrences) and we (15). The you' pronoun is only found in its plural form here. It is much more frequent in the Story-likes thn in the previous types. The you set can be divided into two subsets corresponding to two distinct functions of the pronoun: the first one is the generic form, close to the indefinite pronoun 'one? (when you make surveys"); the second seres as a direct addressto the student audience, collctiely ("do you have an idea f..). A limited number of the I pronoun is found here (6 occurrences), ignaling the \*presence of the lecturer, whereas the collective you' indicates the \*presence of the audience" and we' marks the \*presence of both". Allof these are, according to Lukka, "signals of interactional atitudes" in interpersonal metadiscourse (1992, pp. 79-80). That metadiscourse' describes elements that are used for interactional management and textual organization, in oral or written texts. Adel (2010, p. 81) reinforces this point: you' \*clearly refers to the audience, and the units are used to direct the audience's attention and influence their interpretation of the ongoing discourse. This density of personal pronouns sugests a strong desire on the part of the lecturers to involve ther students in the actual delivery of content, to make them fel that they belong to the community of engineers. The tentative use of humor (Section 5.5.7)

serves a similar purpose, providing cognitive respite from concentrating on otherwise serious content.

5.6. Scenarios - The behavior of unsaturated soil & electromagnetic interference

According to Nesi and Alsop (2021), when lecturers have recourse to Scenarios, they choose to describe imagined contexts. They link the lecture subject mattr to imaginary or surprising situations, inviting their audience to visualize scenes or actions. They argue that Scenarios engage the lecturers and their student audiences in the construction of mostly imaginary dialogues (ibid.), via the use of imperatives, personal pronouns, conditionals and imagined direct speech. Imperatives like imagine, suppose, let's say' involve the audience, as do first- and second-person pronouns like the non-generic you' or the inclusive we' If-clause conditionals, which may co-occur with so or due to, guide listeners through athought experiment. We emphasize that our acceptation of the term scenario is not restricted to 'fantastic' events, and is thus broader than that of Nesi and Alsop.

Two samples of Scenarios from CoFEL are presented below. The first comes from a Soil Mechanics lcture on 'soil moisture' - the water content of a soil - and capillary action - the behavior of a liquid flowing in narrow spaces, also called capillary ridges' Here the lecturer ass his students to use their imagination and picture the scene, the hypothetical ent: the presence of some soil and the interstitial water it contains. The lecturer supports his depiction with a drawing on the chalkboard. The last three sentences constitute the nesry coda, untioning as a cmny on its current relance (2021, p.11). In this first ample, almost a of the content and morphosyntactic Scenario markers enumerated above are present and have been boxed, for easier reference.

concerning the behavior of unsaturated soil it's something which is |very complex. if you! imagine that you have a soil. ok? {lecturer is drawing on chalkboard} this is the level of the soil. at a given depth you have groundwater. ok? $\boxed { \mathrm { s o } }$ here you have the grains everywhere- ok? er this part of the soil will be said to be saturated. ok? here we have a zone of the soil that will be wet but unsaturated. ok? and maybe part of the soil that will be more or less dry if you assume that there wasn't any rain. while you have these in fact you] have a kind of transition zone here [due to the capillarity. [...] the- first specific point is that er when you have a soil which is saturated the water can flow and is free to move. when you have drains with a soil that is not saturated then you will have some capillarity effect and you will have liquid bridges- let's say. ok? <FRENCH> des ponts liquides </FRENCH> and this water in fact will be glued to the grain and will not be free to move. ok?

Coda

so this is why when we have a soil that is saturated we say there is some free water. and when you have a soil which is not saturated then you have some absorbed water- ok?

The second sample of a Scenario from CoEL comes from a Power Electronics lecture on electromagnetic interference' (here divergently referred to as diaphony' afer the French term dicphonie). The lecturer is questioning his audience about the relevance of shielding a circuit y asking themto imagine" the potentil use and effect of a metal shield. Here the Scnario markers are imagine, the non-generic you' and recourse to the epistemic modals 'may' and conditional could, which reinforces the hypothetical'stuation. The necessary coda can be found in the lecturer's question and its potential resolution by the students.

in general application $\boxed { \mathrm { y o u } }$ have power routes which are generating a high (electric field) and to have signal routes which are sensitive to the capacitive diaphony. so very often (you) find some (cabling) rules which impose to separate power and signal routes- of course. you cannot separate the routes- $\boxed { \mathrm { s o } }$ here $\overbrace { \mathrm { y o u } } ^ { \mathrm { ~ } }$ have again the first (signal) line which is excited by disturbance voltage and here it's your victim. what about shielding? you could imagine put a metal shield between the two lines because er from maybe your basic (remembrance) of maxwell('s) equations you may imagine| that it may be interesting for you to have a kind of shield which would prevent the electrical field er (from) flowing from the line one to line two. [...]

Coda

So the question is this one. is the metal shield effective in the situation here? and you will be asked to answer by yes or no.

Excerpt 12. Second Scenario example (20201016_SAJ_SCEN_10)

By linking the lecture topic to imaginary or surprising sitations, encouraging thr audience to visualize scenes or actions, lecturers may be seeking to help learners to engage with the information and retain it (Nesi & Alsop, 2021, p. 24). Scenarios are also used to explain or ilustrat technical ocabulary, or to introduce key complex or highly abstract concepts of the discipline. Their pedagogical potential is therefore very high. As Malmstrom et al. (2017, p. 4) remark, highlighting the role of terminology in content courses, what content teachers teach is in a way the concepts underlying the terminology of the field" (2017, p. 4). Yet, they also add that, in the fundamental field of terminology, the EMl lecturers they observed had  limited repertoire" of strategies for drawing attention to new terminology (2017, p. 12).

# 6. Conclusion and perspectives

This study of storytelling in French MI lectures shows that some lecturers do explore the realm of storytelling, albeit ifrequently, straying ocasionall from authoritative facts or established findings in their lecture content. USsing proven story markers, twenty candidate stories were found in CoFEL and eighteen of them were identified as stories. Then, those stories were delineated and categorized by thre raters into the i story tyes retained from the litratre, with at least one representative for ech type: arrative, Anecdote, Exemplum, Recount, Story-like and Scenario. This typology could serve as a paradigm for more comprehensive data mining of CoFEL as well as other corpora, which would facilitate the comparison of stories in L1 and L2 lecturing contexts.

The excerpts which were analyzed illustrat how the lecturers trive to involve their audiences, for instance by using interactional language, exploiting direct-address personal pronouns, integrating engaging imperatives, like imagine or suppose', and evoking personal or profesional experiences. ditionally divergent ELF lexical or morphosyntactic forms were found in the discourse of some of the lecturers. While this might abate the efect that a good plot a captivating topic or a humorous account can have on listeners, we nonetheless would argue that the use of stories in a lecture does not depend on perfect mastery of the language.

This exploratory study has its limitations, perhaps most notably the fact that switching to massive online teaching because of the 2020 pandemic may have impacted the use of stories in virtual clases, because of the loss of proximity and, therefore, lowered empathy. However, the primary goal has ben met, as the results confirm the presence of several types of stories in the CoFEL corpus of EMI lectures. While the multimodal recordings have not yet bee full exploite, future analyses of audio and visual cues could provide more detail about when and how lecturers adapt ther atitude, tone and spech rat to tell story. A finer analysis f the stories could inform a template fr each story type, and this could be used by lecturers and their trainers to raise awarenes of story types and to incite reflection on their pedagogical potential. The story templates could be adapted for specific subjects and be incorporated into lecturers' sill sets. Moreover, the divergent morphosyntax encountered in the story samples also merit analysis, as EMI lecturers and international students may be disoriented by idiomatic, cultural or idiosyncratic differences. There may also be a potential link betwen the ecturers angag level, or deef exprie, ad ther propensit to ell store. Finall, the lecturers w participated could be interviewed to explore their awarenessof the potential of storytelling. Those who do not use stories could be invited to try, and linguistic or pedagogical assistance could be offered.

Future research could focus on storytelling sils in different contexts. It could be useful to compare similar corpus data from other countries, to explore cultural diffrences, with either L1 or L2 lecturers. Exploring storytelling at other educational levels and examining disciplinary fields other than engineering could be valuable. In a comparative approach between nomothetic (sciences) and idiographic (humanities) disciplines, Bjorkman (2008, p. 120) suggests that, in the former language i used to report results" whereas the lattr \*construct results through language. Moreover, traning programs could be developed to support an intentional approach to stories. Together with Ege et al. (2022), who analyzed seven Turkish lecturers \*strategic discourse behaviors" and their functions, we found that ecturers \*encountered many linguistic challenges due to a lack of fluency", especially concerning lexis, and that they could adopt more conscious discourse strategies". The intentional recourseto storytelling could be one such strategy. Training programs could focus on diicult-to-explain terminology and concepts and consider stories to convey them more effectively. Such programs could be studied in engineering or broader higher education contexts to see whether stories help to connect with an audience and build rapport through emotional and social experiences.

To conclude, i today's world of rapid communication and shared science, engineering lecture content is likely to be quite similar across countries, regardles of the lectrer's origin or country in which they work. If research confirms the pedagogical usefulness of storyteling i such instructional contexts, we would favor intitutional support for professional development, so that lecturers could increase their awarenessof the value of storytelling and exploit stories more frequently in their lectures. With some preparation and minimal practice, storytelling could be added to lecturers' skills, which could benefit students as well as lecturers.
