# Abstract

This paper analyses the thematic structure of the Method and Discussion section of biology research articles. A corpus of 30 journal articles was analysed using the categories of Systemic Functional Linguistics and a semantic categorisation for unmarked themes realised by subject. The study revealed differences in the thematic construction of the sections. The Method section was dominated by simple themes, realised by subjects that predominantly represented objects of research. The few textual themes found were mainly temporal external themes. The simple themes of the Discussion were mainly realised by subjects that represented abstractions, particularly epistemic concepts. In this section, there was an important proportion of textual and interpersonal themes. The differences found may be attributed to the different rhetorical purposes of the sections, which materialise in descriptive texts in the Method section and in argumentative texts in the Discussion section. The information provided by this research may contribute a tool for teachers to help learners construct sentences that are appropriate for the genre.

# 1. Introduction

The importance of scientific communication has focused researchers’ attention on the study of genres associated with the scientific publication system. Interest has been placed on various aspects of the genres, such as the moves of grant proposals (Connor & Mauranen, 1999), the process of peer revision (Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995; Gosden, 1995; Myers, 1990), or the optional and obligatory moves of the submission letter (Swales, 1996). The research article (RA), however, is perhaps the academic genre that has attracted greatest attention not only because of the vast number of articles published annually, but also because of the need to help researchers and postgraduate students succeed in the construction of texts appropriate for submission to scientific journals. Much of this success involves academic socialisation, that is, an understanding of the rules and strategies of the academic community (Belcher & Braine, 1995; Swales, 1990), which materialise in the linguistic choices made in the texts.

These linguistic choices do not appear to be clear to non-native writers of papers in English. Particularly in foreign language contexts, researchers suffer the reiterated frustration of having their papers returned for language reasons. Remarks like ‘‘The subject of the paper is interesting and up to date; however, the English used is poor and should be significantly improved along the text’’ are very common in the editors’ replies to papers submitted by these writers. These comments are aggravated by the recommendation that the papers should be revised by a native speaker, when very rarely are there native speakers available for consultation in the region, even less native speakers that are also specialists in science. The difficulties of Non-Native Speaking (NNS) writers to publish have been perceived as a problem by different researchers concerned about the feeling of exclusion and marginalisation of NNS writers of research articles (Belcher & Braine, 1995; Hyland & Hamp-Lyons, 2002; Swales, 1990), by researchers wishing to find out the nature of the problems of NNS writers (e.g. Coates, Sturgeon, Bohannan, & Pasini, 2002), and researchers studying NNSs’ difficulties observed in the process of rewriting in reply to editors’ comments (e.g. Gosden, 1995).

Comments like the editor’s earlier point out one major problem that NNS writers seem to have: their texts are not perceived as appropriate for professional journals, although the exact nature of the problem is not made explicit. It emerges that if these writers want to succeed, they need to have deep knowledge of the language of the article. They need to know not only about the culture of which the article forms part or the rhetoric of the article but also how to use grammar and lexis to construct sentences appropriate for the RA. The contributions of functional grammar (Halliday, 1994), which relate form to meaning and context, can shed light into aspects of the language of the article that non-native users of the English language should master.

Various studies on the language of science based on functional grammar have highlighted aspects of the particular grammatical forms that have evolved to construct and represent the scientific experience (Halliday 1993a, 1993b). The theme, defined by Halliday (1994) as the point of departure of the message and realised in English by first position in the clause, is considered to play a central role in the construction of texts, particularly in the organisation of the message. It has also been observed that different genres are structured differently at the level of theme (Fries, 1983, in Ghadessy, 1995). In relation to the genres of science, Halliday (1993c, p. 74) observes that in scientific texts the role of theme as an organiser is crucial, as those texts which have a clear thematic pattern result in readable texts, whereas texts with varied theme patterns, which in literary texts may seem to be elegant and aesthetic, in the sciences result in complex texts that are unfriendly and difficult to read. Developing NNSs’ awareness about how scientists that succeed in publishing construct sentences appropriate for the thematic organisation of the article may be a step towards success in publication.

Studies on thematic choice in scientific texts have concentrated on pedagogical texts (e.g. Martin, 1993), on engineers’ reports (McKenna, 1997) and on RAs (e.g. Gosden, 1992, 1993; Whittaker, 1995). Gosden’s studies focused on marked and unmarked thematic choices and their differences in use across the sections of scientific articles. Whittaker compared thematic realisations in two disciplines, Linguistics and Economics, to emphasise disciplinary differences. There are also studies on the thematic structure of other genres, such as Gru¨ ber’s (2000) studies of thematic choices in academic e-mail discussion lists, Ghadessy’s (1995) study of newspapers sports commentaries, Ventola’s (1995) and Ghadessy and Gao’s (2001) studies of thematic development in parallel texts, and Berry’s (1995) study of theme in schoolchildren’s writing of texts for guidebooks.

This study intends to contribute information to the existing research on Theme in the RA by comparing thematic realisations in two sections, Method and Discussion, which were chosen because they have different purposes in the RA and because of the difficulties observed in the writings of NNS. The difficulties these sections presented to NNS writers were observed in my experience instructing researchers and graduate students in a university of a Spanish-speaking country (Martı´ nez, 2002). In Methods, the authors recount their experiments and how they carried them out, attempting to persuade the readers that the experiments were done according to the accepted norms and standards. In Discussions, on the other hand, writers evaluate and interpret the data obtained in relation to the problem presented, and attempt to persuade the readers of the relevance of the findings in relation to other findings, leading to the construction of knowledge (Hunston, 1994). The differences in purpose render the Method factual and the Discussion argumentative, and it may be expected that these differences also manifest in different thematic choices.

# 2. Theoretical background

Systemic theory interprets linguistic behaviour as choice. Meanings are made by choosing, and therefore, interpretation of an actual linguistic choice is made against the background of potential, but not effected, alternative choices. These choices are, according to Halliday (1994), determined by the context. But only three aspects of the situation have linguistic consequences: field (topic), tenor (relationship of participants) and mode (role of language). These three register variables are reflected in the structure of each clause, as each clause is organised to express experiential, interpersonal and textual meanings, which are manifested in the transitivity structure, the mood structure and the thematic structure, respectively.

This study is concerned with thematic structure as defined by Halliday (1994), Eggins (1994) and Martin, Matthiessen, and Painter (1997), which refers to the organisation of information within individual clauses and, through this, to the organisation of the larger text. The system of Theme organises the clause to show how it fits to its surrounding context, thus contributing to the cohesive development of the text.

Textual meaning in English is expressed by means of the order constituents are given in the clause. According to Halliday (1994), the Theme is the starting point of the message, what the clause is going to be about. The Theme is identified by first position in the clause: it is the element that comes first. The part of the clause in which the Theme is developed is called the Rheme, as in:

<html><body><table><tr><td>1Detritus accumulation</td><td>was also substantially greater in the 3400-year-old sites than in the paired 136-year-old sites.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Theme</td><td>Rheme</td></tr></table></body></html>

The clause constituents that belong in the Theme are the obligatory topical or experiential element, and the optional interpersonal and textual elements. The topical Theme is an element occupying first position to which a transitivity function can be assigned. Every clause contains one and only one topical Theme, which in declarative clauses is typically realised in the subject. The interpersonal Theme is the element to which a mood label can be assigned. In its expected, or congruent, form it may be realised in vocatives, modal adjuncts and a mood-marking element, that is, the finite verbal operator or the WH-interrogative (Halliday, 1994, pp. 49, 54). Non-congruently it is realised in subjective (We believe that . . .) and objective $I t$ is possible that . . .) interpersonal metaphors (pp. 354 ff.). The textual Theme realises cohesive work relating the clause to its context through continuity adjuncts and conjunctive adjuncts (Halliday, 1994 pp. 49, 53, 323 ff.; Halliday & Hasan, 1976).

Clauses may have a multiple theme structure, containing a sequence of Themes. In such cases, textual and interpersonal optional Themes occur before the obligatory topical Theme:

<html><body><table><tr><td>2Therefore,</td><td>it is possible that</td><td>classical MAP kinase isoforms</td><td>play a role in ..</td></tr><tr><td>Texual Theme</td><td>Interpersonal Theme</td><td>Topical Theme</td><td>Rheme</td></tr></table></body></html>

There are some special cases of Theme analysis that are worth highlighting. In existential clauses the theme is there, even when this constituent is not labelled for transitivity. Also, when the dependant clause comes first, the whole clause functions as Theme. In cleft sentences the first ideational construction is considered a predicated Theme.

Themes are marked or unmarked depending on their relationship to the mood structure of the clause. The unmarked Theme is that in which the typical mood structure occurs in initial position in the clause. Then, unmarked topical Themes are the subject in declarative clauses, the finite in questions, the predicator in imperatives and the Wh- element in Wh- interrogative clauses. Marked Themes are those realised by any other constituent located in initial position as well as predicated Themes, as in:

<html><body><table><tr><td>3In the other four sites</td><td>we measured the circumference and ..</td></tr><tr><td>Marked theme</td><td>Rheme</td></tr></table></body></html>

The subject has received special attention in studies on the language of RAs, and they constitute the majority of their unmarked themes (Whittaker, 1995). Gosden (1993) studies subjects in science articles to explain the tension between subjectivity and objectivity in the RA. MacDonald (1994) focuses on subjects to disclose subdisciplinary differences in texts of the humanities. Whittaker (1995) provides a classification of subjects according to their transitivity role and compares their realisations in texts of economics and linguistics. The present study provides a subclassification of themes partially inspired in MacDonald’s and Gosden’s. The classes used in this study are:

(a) ‘Objects of research’, including the materials on which researchers work, as well as the places where they work and the physical instruments that they need to do their work.   
(b) ‘Research-related processes’, the nominalisations that serve to abstract the actions performed by the researcher.   
(c) ‘Epistemic nouns’, including the abstractions that refer to the reasoning of researchers.   
(d) ‘Authors’, the researchers in their role of authors of the paper, that is, the researchers in ‘‘self mention’’ (Hyland, 2001).   
(e) ‘Authors cited’ refer to researchers cited, including the authors’ self-citations.   
(f) ‘Reference’ including personal and demonstrative pronouns, except for those included in categories d) (first person pronouns) and e) (pronouns with authors cited as referents).   
(g) ‘Empty themes’, including empty $i t$ and there.

The categories intend to represent what doing science involves: manipulating objects in the real world, abstracting to generalise, classify and evaluate (Martı´ nez, 2001), and relating to others in the discipline through first person use and citation. This involves a movement form fact to abstraction occurring from the Method to the Discussion sections, accompanied by increased dialogic intervention. The first three categories reflect the movement from fact to increased abstraction; categories (d) and (e) relate to the interpersonal status of the article through the use of interactive dialogic pronouns and citations; categories (f) and (g) capture the choices of authors to substitute for referents and to provide empty themes as points of departure.

The unit of analysis for the study was the orthographic sentence or clause complex, as defined by Halliday (1994), and employed in other studies of thematic structure (e.g. Ghadessy & Gao, 2001; Whittaker, 1995). The variables considered were the section of the article: Method and Discussion; the type of Theme: Simple (Topical) and Multiple (Interpersonal $^ +$ Topical; Textual $^ +$ Topical; Textual $^ +$ Interpersonal $^ +$ Topical); the structure of the topical Theme: Phrasal Theme and clausal Theme; Markedness: Unmarked (Subject in declarative clauses, Wh- word or finite in interrogative clauses and process in imperative clauses) and marked (Complement as Theme, Circumstance as theme and Predicated Theme); and the subject of unmarked themes (‘Objects of research’, ‘research-related processes’, ‘epistemic nouns’, ‘authors’, ‘authors cited’, ‘reference’ and ‘empty themes’).

# 3. Materials and method

The type of analysis performed, contrastive text analysis, ‘‘involves taking texts that are similar in some respects but different in others’’ (Eggins, 1994 p. 310). Two sections were chosen for comparison, Method and Discussion, both because genre analysis predicts that linguistic choices will differ across the schematic stages of each genre and because they appear to offer difficulties to NNS writers whose first language is Spanish. The Method section is not problematic for these writers from a rhetorical perspective, but the construction of clauses appears problematic, probably due to L1 interference. The clauses in the Discussion section have also proved to be difficult for NNS to construct, but in this case the difficulty appears to be due to the argumentative nature of the section and to low lexical competence, particularly the command of an active epistemic lexicon.

The corpus consisted of 30 Method and Discussion sections of RAs of the biological sciences. The articles were selected from 15 quality journals (appendix). The articles exhibited the pattern Introduction–Method–Results and Discussion (IMRD, Swales, 1990). The articles selected were produced in a university of an Englishspeaking country. This selection was done with the aim of building a corpus representative of the language produced by successful writers who were probably native speakers. The choice of corpus was based on Mauranen’s (1996) concept of a thematically good text:

We here take the typical native speaker user in edited and published texts as a criterion for acceptable use, and regard any text that meets this criterion as ‘‘good’’. In this way, all L1 texts in the material are good texts by definition. Even though they cannot be held up as ideal models, their typical features can be used as a guide to the working of text in that language (p. 213).

The categorisation scheme used for Theme analysis was Halliday’s (1994). Although there are alternative classifications within European functionalism (e.g. Berry, 1995; Gosden, 1992, 1993), Halliday’s was preferred for the following reasons:

It provides obligatory (ideational) and optional (textual and interpersonal) elements through the concept of multiple theme. The optional character of interpersonal and textual themes constitutes a key factor in understanding sentence construction from a thematic perspective. Interpersonal meanings may be expressed by resources other than interpersonal theme (modals, adjuncts) and the logical relations expressed in textual themes may be explicit or implicit. However, it is not possible to substitute for an ideational point of departure, which is what carries the ‘‘aboutness’’ of the message.

It relates Theme to the other metafunctions (ideational and interpersonal), thus integrating the ways of materialising the three types of meanings in clause initial position. It relates Theme to subcategorisations already provided by the theory, particularly the system of conjunction (Halliday & Hasan, 1976) for textual Theme, the system of modality, particularly mood and comment adjuncts, and interpersonal metaphors (Halliday, 1994). This makes the categories comprehensive, and the analyst does not need to provide ad-hoc subcategorisations.

Halliday’s (1994) subcategories are not fully comparable to other European functionalists’ categories as they differ in what they include. For example, Gosden (1992) uses the general definition of Theme provided by Halliday, but for subcategorisation he follows Davies (1988b, in Gosden, 1992) and uses her concept of ‘contextualising frames’. Within this conception, marked themes are interpreted as the use of any structure other than the subject as point of departure. For Halliday, markedness is associated with choices other than the subject within the scope of the transitivity structure and is related to the mood of the clause. So, for declarative statements the marked choices are constituents other than the subject (adverbials or complements) and predicated themes. Sentence initiators such as however and fortunately do not form part of the transitivity and are considered optional textual and interpersonal elements of the thematic structure.

The data obtained from the analysis were summarised employing descriptive statistics through frequency tables and through cross-tabulation (cross-breaks) for category-data analysis. Inferential statistics were used for the significance tests in the expected frequency tables. The significance test employed was the Chi-square, with a significance of $P { = } 0 . 0 5$ . The data were analysed using the statistics software SPSS (Statistics Package for Social Sciences).

To validate the categories three independent raters were consulted. They were provided with a list of the categories, the criteria for inclusion and a sample of three corpus texts to apply them. There was full agreement on the assigned grammatical categories. For the semantic categories ‘objects of research’, ‘research processes’ and ‘epistemic nouns’, there was $90 \%$ agreement. This may have been due to different possible classifications of items. Full agreement was reached when the following specific criteria were established to classify problem cases. For the classification of the subjects of unmarked themes, the item selected was the head of the noun groups. However, Halliday (1994, p. 195) observes that in nominal groups where the Head is a measure nominal, the Head does not coincide with the semantic core of the nominal group, the ‘Thing’. So, in nominal groups with a measure noun as Head, the noun in the of-construction was considered for the count. In the example that follows, the word studies was the one counted [The letter at the end of the examples indicates that the source was the Discussion (D) or the Method section (M)].

4— A number of recent studies have implicated MAP kinase homologues in a number of cellular events. . . [6]. (D)

Some words were classified as belonging to different categories according to their use. Such was the case of the word analysis, that was categorised as an epistemic noun when it was followed by a relational process (suggest and follow in examples 5 and 6) and as a process when it was in the context of a material process (perform and conduct in examples 7 and 8), thus suggesting that the noun had been used with that meaning.

5— However, 16S rRNA sequence analyses suggest the presence of acidophilic bacteria in these samples (D)

6— Nutrient analyses followed the methodologies used by Vitousek (M)

7— Microbiological analyses were performed on samples representing three distinct levels of PAH concentrations and pH values (M)

8— These analyses were conducted by the Agricultural Diagnostic Service Center, University of Hawaii at Manoa (M)

Nouns like nature, which may be interpreted as an object of research, was categorised as epistemic noun when it was used with the meaning of ‘essence’.

9— The heterogeneous nature of the urban landscape results in sharply defined home range boundaries with little overlap. (D)

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Multiple themes

The results of the comparison of the types of themes in the Method and Discussion sections were statistically significant The interpersonal themes concentrated in the Discussion section. The proportions found in this study (Table 1) contrast with

Whittaker’s (1995) findings, obtained from the whole article, without discriminating sections. She found an average of around $9 \%$ interpersonal themes for both Linguistics and Economics RAs. These differences suggest the relevance of observing distributions across the sections of RAs.

The interpersonal themes in the Discussion were realised congruently by mood and comment adjuncts (Eggins, 1994) and non-congruently by interpersonal subjective and objective interpersonal metaphors. Out of the 64 cases of interpersonal themes found in this section, $60 \%$ were mood adjuncts and $40 \%$ were comment, or attitude, adjuncts. The most frequent mood structures found were $i t$ is/seems possible, possibly, we believe, it is clear, while the most frequent comment structures were indeed, interestingly, (un) fortunately, importantly.

10— Therefore, it is possible that classical MAP kinase isoforms play a role in acute responses in endothelial cells rather than long-term responses (D)

11— Interestingly, no significant differences in Xtrp expression were observed between the vegetal and animal hemispheres of the. . . (D)

In this study, interpersonal themes occurred in a lower proportion than textual themes (Table 1), while in Whittaker’s (1995) and Ghadessy’s (1995) studies interpersonal themes were more frequent. The differences with Whittaker’s study suggest a higher degree of impersonality in the biological sciences than in the social sciences, whereas the differences with Ghadessy’s study can be explained as generic differences, sports commentaries being more conversational in nature.

The distribution and most frequent cases of textual themes in both sections are shown in Table 2. In the Method, the cases of textual themes were mainly external temporal textual themes (Halliday & Hasan, 1976). The Discussion section was dominated by adversative themes. The adversative connective however was the most frequent, representing $73 \%$ of the adversative cases in the Discussion.

12— The primary amino acid sequences of cytochromes P460 from N europaea and M. capsulatus Bath are dissimilar, despite [. . .]. However, the presence of a small number of conserved amino acid residues throughout both cytochromes suggests . . . (D)

Given that the Method section is written chronologically (Swales, 1990), the temporal themes were used as external organisers of sequences, as in example 13, or as internal organisers to express synthesis. In this last function, the connector briefly was frequently used.

13— First, a 414 bp ADH1 terminator PstI/HindIII fragment from pCBT9 (Clontech) was ligated into PstI/Hindlil-cleaved Ycplacl1l (Gietz and Sugino, 1988). Next, the HSC82 promoter was inserted as a BamHI/SaiI-cleaved PCR-generated fragment, to give vector pHSCprom. [. . .]. Finally, the complete C. albicans HSP90 gene coding region was inserted into pHSCprom as a. . . (M)

In the Discussion, the temporal conjunctions were different from those in the Method. They were mainly internal, referring to the communication process, with the meaning of ‘‘next in the course of discussion’’ (Halliday & Hasan, 1976 p. 263).

There were some cases of multiple interpersonal, textual and topical themes, which concentrated mainly in the Discussion section.

# 4.2. Structure of topical theme

The topical themes were realised mainly by phrases in both sections. When they were realised by clauses, there was a higher proportion of non-finite clauses in the Method and a higher proportion of finite clauses in the Discussion (Table 3)

16— PHRASE: In the other four sites we measured the circumference and height of all living tree stems $> 1 0$ cm in circumference at breast height. . . (M)

17— NON-FINITE CLAUSE: To estimate their total biomass and allocation patterns we utilised the biomass-regression equations and original harvest data of Aplet and Vitousek (1994), matching species as closely as possible (M)

18— FINITE CLAUSE: Whenever a leaf, ramet, or branch died it was harvested, oven-dried at $7 0 ^ { \circ } C$ , weighed, and ground for later nutrient analysis (M)

# 4.3. Markedness

Unmarked themes dominated in both sections. The marked themes were practically all circumstantials (Table 4). The marked themes found in the sections were distributed differently, as shown in Table 5. In the Method section, the most frequent marked themes were of purpose and of time. The circumstances of purpose in this section referred mainly to the purpose of the actions of the researcher and were mainly materialised in non-finite purpose clauses of the structure to $^ +$ verb and phrases initiated by for.

19— To determine if observed differences among young-flow sites were significantly correlated with elevation, linear regression was applied. (M)

The marked temporal themes found in the Method section referred to external temporal sequences. They were used to organise the text explicitly from the perspective of time, emphasising the chronological sequencing of the steps of research. Temporal sequences initiated with after and following were common, indicating that once a specific action was completed, another was carried out, thus establishing a clear dependence of the second action on the completion of the first.

20— After the process of choosing markers had been performed on all of the linkage groups/blocks, the total number of markers introgressing per individual was recorded. (M)

Marked themes of place usually expressed external contrasts between locations described in the text itself, as in the following example:

21— We inventoried all trees in the young site at $I 6 6 0 m$ , where there were few trees, and inventoried a single $2 0 \times I O O$ m transect contiguous to the old site at $7 0 0 m$ , which had an extraordinarily dense under-story. In the other four sites we measured the circumference and height of all living tree stems . . . $( M )$

The greatest concentration of marked themes in the Discussion section was of circumstances of place. It is interesting to point out that $5 5 \%$ of the cases of circumstances of place found in this section were internal according to Halliday and Hasan’s (1976) definition. Some such expressions are: in our model, here, in our experiments, in this case, in the current and earlier studies, in experiment 2.

# 4.4. Unmarked themes

The analysis of the nuclei of unmarked themes (subjects) showed that they were distributed in a particularly interesting way in the sections compared (Table 6). Of these categories only ‘authors cited’ are equivalent in inclusion to Gosden’s (1993) category of subjects ‘interactive participant’, which makes them comparable.

The Method section was dominated by ‘objects of research’. The Method section is the section where the researchers explain the steps followed in the experimental phase. ‘Objects of research’ were the most frequent point of departure, as the Method section is not about the researchers, but mainly about the materials on which the researchers act (Martı´ nez, 2001). The most frequent cases were:

Cells, DNA, product, animals, clones, membrane, probes, protein, RNA, colonies, peptide, strain, lines, pellets, antisera, cultures, mutants, soil, tissue, primers, bacteria, mice, oocytes, PCR, rats, seeds, immunoprecipitates, pots, samples, lysate, crystals, foxes, in105, vector, alleles, antibodies, material, blood, blots, embryos, oligonocleatides, species

The lower presence of ‘objects of research’ in thematic position in the Discussion may be due to the fact that the Discussion concentrates not on the objects of study but on the interpretation of the observations made during the experimental phase. The most frequent cases found were:

‘Research-related processes’ had a similar distribution in both sections. In the Method section the most frequent cases were:

activities, reaction, analyses, hybridization, incubation, mutation, production, radioactivity, irrigation, amplification, distribution, electrophoresis, phosphorylation

In the Discussion section:

mutation, activity, analysis (es), accumulation, interactions, activation, adhesion

The presence of cases for this category in thematic position was predicted from the theory: Halliday (1993b) suggests that nominalisations occur in and characterise the language of science. They offer the possibility to package information so as to function as Theme and for writers to generalise, classify and evaluate, as they usually occur in the context of relational processes.

‘Epistemic nouns’ occurred in the Method section, but their presence was higher in the Discussion. Given that doing science is a form of abstracting from facts, a high percentage of this type of nouns in thematic position could be expected. The higher presence of cases in the Discussion can be attributed to the argumentative nature of the section, where the results obtained are interpreted and discussed. Their presence indicates that this section is about the abstractions that emerge from scientific experimentation and the results obtained. The most frequent epistemic nouns, with a minimum of three cases, listed in decreasing order of frequency, were:

In Method: data, sequence, concentrations, method, result, product, value, fragment, number, isolates, effect, conditions, grid, analyses, experiment, patterns, probes, procedure, samples, distance, level, study, subsamples, composition, control, group, growth, presence, size, species, measure, rate, mixtures, curves, change, gradients, phenotype, probabilities, process, profile, quadrat, set, question, regressions, structure, yield.

In Discussion: result(s), model, distribution, difference, studies, analysis (es), assumption, evidence, observation, probabilities, rate, response, variation, finding, increase, method, nature, proportion, levels, work.

The category of ‘Authors’ manifested only in the pronoun we, as the texts of the corpus were of multiple authorship. It must be noted that when we introduced subjective interpersonal metaphors (e.g. We believe that. . .), it was not counted within this category. The same occurred with $i t$ when it introduced objective interpersonal metaphors (e.g. It is clear that. . .). The pronoun we was more frequent in the Discussion. Although the proportion was low in both sections, it was surprising to find cases in the Method, as this section is usually expressed by passive constructions (Martı´ nez, 2001). However, the range of distribution of we in the corpus produced interesting results. We was found in only 4 of the 30 Method sections analysed, while it was present in 16 of the 30 Discussion sections. In the Method, two texts used 24 of the 27 cases of we found in the data. This indicates that its use in the Method may be a stylistic decision.

In some cases, the examples of first person use suggested that the author was introducing an unconventional method, a modification to a conventional method, or actions proposed by the author that were presented as original in relation to what is established (Tarone, Dwyer, Gillette, & Icke, 1998), as seems to be the case in the following example:

22— For each fit we also used additional criteria. We plotted the weighted residuals and calculated the auto-correlation of the . . . (M)

In the Discussion, the presence of first person in thematic position was expected, given that this section is argumentative. According to Myers (1989), its use may be considered a form of personalisation of the results, circumscribing them to the particular experience described by the authors, as in:

23— We found that this degradation is totally abolished by the presence of an Nterminal $( H i s ) _ { 6 }$ tag on Hsp82 protein (D)

Only 13 cases of ‘authors cited’ were found in thematic position in the corpus, and all were in the Discussion $( 1 . 3 \% )$ . In Gosden’s study, there were no cases in the Method either, and there was a higher, though still low, proportion of cases in the Discussion. The low frequency of citations as point of departure of the message may be due to the fact that the arguments in the biological sciences are about the abstractions of science rather than about the researchers who produced them. This finding is supported by Hyland’s (2001) finding that the science with the highest percentage of non-integral citations was biology, which indicates that this science de-emphasises the authors of citations.

‘Reference’ was relatively low in the Method and was found in only fourteen of the thirty sections. Of the 32 cases of ‘reference’, 10 were cases of this used with textual reference (Halliday & Hasan, 1976). This was found in 22 of the 30 Discussion sections studied. It was also the most frequent reference expression, realising 55 of the 69 cases of reference. This finding provides clear evidence that the Method section is tied by cohesive devices other than reference. Instead, reiteration seems to be preferred.

24— We tested for differences between young and old sites at the same elevation using the Mann-Whitney two-sided test. This required that all samples within sites be considered true replicates. (M)

‘Empty themes’ were realised mostly by there in both sections, but they were very scarce in the Method section.

# 5. Discussion

The results of the analysis of the thematic structure of the Method and Discussion sections of Biology RAs revealed interesting differences of thematic choices between the sections. The differences in thematic choices can be explained in relation to the rhetorical goals of the sections of RAs. In this four-part construction—Introduction, Method, Results and Discussion—the Method section is the stage where the authors describe the materials used in their experiments, the steps followed to carry out the experiments, and the statistical procedures followed to analyse their observations (Hunston, 1994; Swales, 1990). The Method, according to Swales, reads like checklists, in this case lists of actions following a chronological order, without topic shifts. The checklist character was manifested in the thematic regularities that emerged from the analysis, as the Method section was constructed mainly with simple topical themes, most of which were unmarked, i.e. subjects of declarative clauses. Unmarked themes have an important function giving continuity to a text, and thus contribute to the identification of participants (Martin, 2001). In the Method, the participants could be clearly identified by the semantic functions that the themes performed. They also clearly showed what the Method is about: it is about the objects studied and the abstractions that are required for their observation and analysis.

Marked themes in Method were exclusively realised by circumstances. According to Martin (2001), marked themes are useful markers of transition. However, in the Method they did not seem to be signalling transitions. They were mainly used for emphasis, particularly to focus on the purpose of the actions carried out or on the relevance of the sequences of time. These two functions constituted the majority of the cases of marked themes. In time sequences, the data revealed that temporal marked themes were used when the chronological sequencing appeared to need foregrounding.

The categories not found in thematic position in the Method, or found in low proportions in relation to the Discussion, also appear to be important to visualise the thematic organisation of the message. The structures not found or found in low proportions were multiple themes, and ‘empty themes’, ‘reference’, ‘authors’ and ‘authors cited’ within simple unmarked themes. The few cases of textual themes and the absence of interpersonal themes in the Method section suggest the expository character of the section. This interpretation is related to Whittaker’s (1995) findings, who observed that the expository paragraphs in her study contained a high proportion of unmarked themes and a low proportion of textual themes. The absence of pronouns in thematic position also lends support to Swales’ (1990) observation that the Method reads like a checklist, as these results indicate that sentences are linked together by lexical cohesion, not by referential cohesion. ‘Authors’ and ‘authors cited’, though expected as participants in the genre, were not found in the Method as points of departure of the message. The few cases of ‘authors’, manifested in the pronoun we, were interpreted as having been strategically used in the section. Its strategic character emerges as the rare cases of we found in the article occur against the background of passive constructions that dominate the Method (Martı´ nez, 2001). Following Myers (1989) it is possible to interpret we as a face-saving resource, in the cases found in this study for the introduction of a specific and personal methodological modification, which the authors assume as personal.

The Discussion section is perhaps the most argumentative and abstract part of the article. This is reflected in the thematic choices preferred. The subjects of unmarked themes consisted mainly of epistemic nouns. This shows that there was a movement from more factual descriptions in the Method to more abstract argumentation in the Discussion. The authors’ choices mainly focused on the abstractions that their observations allowed them to construct, which they then evaluated and interpreted in relation to existing findings. In this section, the percentage of multiple themes was four times as high as the percentage in the Method, including textual as well as interpersonal themes. These thematic choices manifest the author’s rhetorical effort to persuade readers. Also the proportion of marked themes was higher in this section, most cases being internal, that is, contributing to the logical organisation of the text. This is in agreement with Whittaker’s (1995) findings: she analysed argumentative and expository paragraphs in her corpus of RAs, and found a greater proportion of marked themes and textual themes in the argumentative paragraphs.

There were more cases of ‘reference’ in the Discussion section. As in Method, they were mostly text pronouns, establishing connections in the text. Thus, at least in thematic position, there were practically no referential chains created. The category of ‘authors’ was important in this section, materialised through the use of first person pronouns. The use of the personal pronouns allows the explicit participation of the authors in the text.

The analysis of Thematic structure captured the movement from fact to abstraction that takes place in the RA from the Method to the Discussion, as well as the movement from low interpersonal intervention to high. This analysis also revealed the different character of the sections, which has already been observed for theme (Gosden, 1992, 1993; Whittaker, 1995) and in other levels of analysis (e.g. Martı´ nez,

2001; Salager-Meyer, 1994). The results revealed that the Method is clearly ideational in character (Matthiessen, 1995). The Discussion, on the other hand, emerges as an argumentative section, dominated by epistemic nouns.

# 6. Pedagogical implications of the study

In the context of the National University of Rio Cuarto (UNRC), Argentina, the teaching of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) has traditionally been defined as the teaching of reading comprehension. This focus on the reading skill appears to have been widespread in many universities in the country and also in other Latin American countries (Dudley-Evans and St. John, 1998). However, the researchers’ need to publish in English has generated a growing demand for academic writing courses. To satisfy this demand, a course for the development of genre awareness was implemented at the UNRC (Martı´ nez, 2002).

Although the learners participating in this course can be considered to be proficient readers of academic texts in English, reading skills do not transfer automatically across languages or modalities in second language learning (Eisterhold, 1990). To facilitate transfer, it is necessary to develop awareness about the different linguistic resources used by writers who succeed in publishing. The value of awareness in the acquisition of knowledge, particularly in the acquisition of a second language, has been widely recognised (e.g. Donmall, 1992; Rutherford and Sharwood Smith, 1985; van Lier, 1996). In EAP courses awareness has been considered to imply academic consciousness raising in relation to the textual aspects and contexts of academic discourse. The purpose has been to share with the learners the rules of the academic discourse community and the resources employed by its members, thus empowering learners to make informed decisions (Belcher & Braine, 1995; Clark, 1992). The development of grammatical awareness, however, appears to have had a secondary place in the syllabus (e.g. Dudley-Evans, 1995; Jacoby, Leech, & Holten, 1995).

In foreign language environments grammatical awareness is essential, given the complex nature of the structures used in science. In this respect, Halliday (1993c) has pointed out that the difficulties of the language of science are not only in the vocabulary or the content, as it is believed. Rather, as science involves reasoning and conceptualisation that makes it different from everyday experience, ‘‘the language in which they [conceptual structures and reasoning processes] are constructed is bound to be difficult to follow’’ (p. 70). Thus, a grammar of discourse, where grammatical forms are explained functionally, in interaction with the textual and social contexts of use, can contribute to the achievement of the goals of the learners.

The difficulties observed in NNS writers in the construction of the sections studied involve mainly problems of sentence construction in the Method and rhetorical organisation in the Discussion. Both may be addressed from the perspective of theme, which offers the NNS writer points of departure for sentence-in-text construction based on semantic categories, as the information provided by this study. This appears to be a more useful teaching strategy than grammatical teaching about sentence construction, which may be confusing for the NNS writers who, as a rule, have not developed their ability to discriminate grammatical categories due to the fact that they come from disciplines not related to language studies. The perception of thematic differences can contribute to a better understanding of the way in which the sections of RAs are constructed. Furthermore, writing with awareness of the relation between the theme and the purpose of these sections may enable the NNS writers to construct thematically appropriate texts, and eventually lead to the ultimate goal of successful publication.
