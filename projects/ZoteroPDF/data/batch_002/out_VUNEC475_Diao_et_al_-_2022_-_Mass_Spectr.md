ABSTRACT: Fine particulate matter $\left( \mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 } \right)$ exposure remains a great health risk worldwide. Epidemiological evidence suggests a possible association between neurodegeneration and $\mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 }$ exposure. In the present study, cutting-edge mass spectrometry imaging techniques were implemented to investigate the spatial distribution of lipids in rat brains after real ambient exposure to air with high $\mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 }$ levels. For the first time, a significant reduction of sulfatides in the brain stem and corpus callosum of PM-exposed rats was observed. Further validation using isolated corpus callosum tissues showed that in addition to decreased sulfatides expression levels of neuroinflammation markers including cytokines, microglial, and astrocyte activation markers were significantly upregulated in the PM-exposure group. Our data, therefore, provides a possible association between PM exposure and neurological damage, via sulfatides reduction and associated neuroinflammation in the corpus callosum region of PM-exposed rat brains.

# INTRODUCTION

Fine particulate matter $\left( \mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 } \right)$ is prevalent in air pollution and poses a human health risk. In 2019, $9 9 \%$ of the population was living in areas where air pollution exceeded the recommended limit of the World Health Organization.' $\mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 }$ exposure was reported to be associated with increased risks of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, mainly via elevated oxidative stress and inflammation.4 In addition, ambient $\mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 }$ exposure might have an adverse impact on the central nervous system (CNs) and increase the incidences of neurodegenerative pathogenesis.,6 However, how $\mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 }$ affects the CNS and even brain function, directly or indirectly, remains unknown. Olfactory bulb inflammation was observed after exposure to severe air pollution.' Magnetite nanoparticles originated from air pollution were detected in the human brain. Both epidemiological and experimental data indicate that the impact of $\mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 }$ exposure on CNS should be noted and needs to be urgently investigated.9,10

Lipids are extremely diverse molecules and generally constituted of hydrophobic fatty acyl chains and hydrophilic headgroups. Self-assembly of lipids forms the membrane bilayer which provides an essential physiological environment for cell survival. Lipids not only serve as structural barriers but also participate in many biological processes. Specific fatty acyl chains released from enzymatic hydrolysis of lipids can be further transformed into signal molecules and participate in various cellular activities.l1 Therefore, detection and identification of lipids are crucial for pathological studies. Ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-HRMS) was routinely used for lipidomic profiling and quantitation in a high-throughput manner.12,1 However, spatial information on lipids was Iost during sample preparation. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) is a powerful tool to quantitatively explore spatial information on molecules within biological samples in a label-free and highthroughput manner.14,13 Knowledge of the spatial distribution of lipids upon external stimulus and during disease progress would be of crucial importance to understand the molecular mechanism of pathogenesis.10,16,17 Despite various researches having addressed the impacts of PM2s exposure on CNs,18,19 the spatial change of lipids in the brain after real ambient $\mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 }$ exposure is still lacking.

In this study, we demonstrated the effects of real ambient PM exposure on lipids distribution in rat brains by applying cutting-edge MSI approaches. The whole-body real ambient exposure was performed during the winter season in Linfen, China, where severe air pollution was caused by coal burning, particularly during winter.2 The obtained results showed that exposure to air with high $\mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 }$ decreased sulfatides in the white matter of rat brains, especially in the corpus callosum and brain stem. Combining with gene expression data as well as emerging evidence from other reports, we speculate that $\mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 }$ exposure was potentially associated with neural damage via neuroinflammation.

# MATERIALS AND METHODS

Chemicals and Materials. 9-Aminoacridine (9AA, ${ \tt > } 9 9 . 5 \% { \tt ) }$ was purchased from TCI Development Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). 2,5-Dihydroxylbenozic acid (DHB, ${ > } 9 9 \%$ was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit, RNAiso, and TB green Premix Ex TaqII were purchased from Takara Bio, Inc. (Kusatsu, Japan). Methanol (MeOH, HPLC grade) and chloroform $\left( \mathrm { C H C l } _ { 3 } \right)$ were purchased from VWR International (Pennsylvania, USA). Sulfatide (d18:1/12:0) standard was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Michigan, USA). Indium tin oxide-coated glass slides were purchased from Delta Technologies, Limited (Colorado, USA).

Animal Experiment. The animal exposure experiment was conducted according to our pre-established real ambient PM exposure protocol. Briefly, remodeled conventional individual ventilated cages (IVC) were installed with three layers of high-efficiency particulate air filters (HEPA) or low-efficiency particulate filters to control the inlet of PM particles. Sprague-- Dawley rats were purchased from the experimental animal center of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine. An unlimited food and water supply were provided. All rats were fed a high-fat diet. Rats were divided into a control (in IVC with HEPA flter) or treatment group (in IVC with lowefficiency filter). For MSI analysis, brain sections from three control vs three treatment rats were used. For sulfatides quantitation and inflammatory marker expression analysis, a total of six control vs six treatment rats were used. After exposure, all rats were anesthetized by pentobarbital and sacrificed. The experimental animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Shan Xi University.

Sample Preparation for MALDI-MSI. The brains were sectioned at $- 2 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ on a cryo-Star $\mathrm { N x } 7 0$ Cryostat (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) at a $1 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { m }$ thickness and thawmounted on indium tin oxide-coated glass slides. The slides were kept at $- 8 0 ~ ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ before use. The slides were dried in a vacuum desiccator for $3 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ before matrix application. 9AA and DHB were prepared in MeOH at 5 and $2 0 \mathrm { \ m g / m L } ,$ respectively. Matrix was deposited directly on slides using a homemade electrospray device. The flow rate of the matrix solution was set to $3 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L } / \mathrm { m i n }$ . The matrix densities of 9AA and DHB were 0.262 and $1 . 0 4 6 ~ \mathrm { m g / c m } ^ { 2 }$ respectively.

Mass Spectrometry Imaging. MS images were acquired on a RapifleX MALDI Tissuetyper mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) equipped with a Smartbeam 3D $3 5 5 ~ \mathrm { { n m } }$ laser. Mass spectra were obtained at a mass range of 80-2000 $m / z$ with 200 accumulated laser shots in reflectron mode. Laser energy was set to $5 4 \%$ for the positive ion mode and $4 7 \%$ for the negative ion mode at a repetition rate of $1 0 , 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { H z }$ A $1 0 0 \ \mu \mathrm { m }$ resolution was achieved by setting a $5 6 \ \mu \mathrm { m }$ laser scan range in both $\mathrm { X }$ and $\mathrm { Y }$ directions in a M5 defocus mode with a

$1 0 0 \ \mu \mathrm { m }$ raster width. The mass spectrometer was calibrated with external standards (Bruker Daltonics). The mass spectra were reconstructed in FlexImaging (Bruker Daltonics) to form ion images and imported into SCiLS Lab 2021c Premium 3D (SCiLS GmbH, Germany) for further analysis. The spectra were normalized to the total ion count (TiC), and segmentation was performed according to anatomic regions. Lipids were assigned by searching Lipid Maps (https://www. lipidmaps.org) with a $1 0 \ \mathrm { p p m }$ mass tolerance.

Real-Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction. Corpus callosum tissue was isolated by dissection. Total RNA of the corpus callosum was isolated by RNAiso (Takara) and transcribed into cDNA with a PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (Takara). A real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed with TB green Premix Ex TaqII (Takara) on a PikoReal Real-Time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) following the manufacturer's protocol. Relative gene expression was normalized to the expression level of glyceraldehyde-3- phosphatase (Gapdh) and presented as $2 ^ { - \Delta \Delta \mathrm { { C T } } }$ . Results were shown as mean $\pm$ standard error of the mean, and nonparametric Student's t tests were implemented to evaluate significant differences. Primer sequences of target genes are shown in Table S1.

Quantitation of Sulfatide in the Corpus Callosum. Sulfatide levels were quantified as described in the literature.22 ST (d18:1/12:0) was added as the internal standard. Lipid extracts were reconstituted in $1 0 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { L }$ of a 1:1 methanol:- chloroform solution and diluted 100 times in MeOH. Lipids extracts were then directly infused into an Orbitrap Exploris 120 mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an inhouse nanoelectrospray ion source.The scan range of the orbitrap was set from $m / z$ 600 to 1200 with a resolution of 120,000 at $m / z 2 0 0$ Sulfatide intensities were normalized with the intensity of the internal standard for quantitation.

# RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Combustion of fossil fuels on large scale causes severe air pollution in Linfen. Using an established real ambient exposure chamber our lab had setup,21 two groups of SD rats were exposed during the coal-burning season from $2 0 1 9 - 1 1 - 2 1$ to 2020-1-18. During the exposure, the daily $\mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 }$ concentration was recorded (Figure S1A). According to air quality guideline values proposed by WHO, the mean concentration of $\mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 }$ was $\bar { \textsf { S } } \bar { \mu } \bar { \mathbf { g } } \bar { / } \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ daily and $1 5 \mathrm { \ } \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ annually. The maximum daily $\mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 }$ concentration was $2 5 0 ~ \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ with an average concentration of $7 7 . 6 \mu \mathrm { g } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 3 }$ . Other than the concentration of $\mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 } ,$ the air quality index of each day is also shown in Figure S1B. During 59 days of exposure, 27 days (or $4 6 \%$ ) had an air quality index (AQI) higher than 100, and only 8 days $( 1 4 \% )$ had a good air quality $( \mathrm { A Q I } \ < \ 5 0 )$ Consequently, the ambient exposure scheme in this study represents a typical heavily polluted winter season with high $\mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 }$ concentration in North China.

Existing evidence indicated that exposure to $\mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 }$ might be associated with neurodegenerative disease. To investigate the effect of the chronic exposure of $\mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 }$ on lipids spatial distribution in rat brains, MALDI-MSI was used to investigate the spatial distribution of lipid species in the sagittal section of rat brains between the control group and treatment group (PM exposure group). DHB was used as the matrix for positive ion mode and 9AA for negative ion mode. A total of 52 lipid species were assigned and imaged (Tables S2 and S3). In positive mode, assigned lipids were primarily phosphatidylcholines (PC) (Figure S2), while in negative mode more diverse lipid classes were detected including sulfatides (ST), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), triglycerides (TG), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS) (Figure S2). The spatial preference of lipids was found specific to the anatomic structure of rat brains (Figure S3).

Eght sulfatides were shown in th figure: ST (d18:1/h24:0) (A) T (d18:1/h24:1) (B), ST (d18:1/h22:0) (C), ST (d18:1/18:0) (D), ST (d18:1/22:0) (E) ST (d18:1/h18:0) (F), ST (d18:1/24:0) (G), and ST (d18:1/24:1).For each image pper one isfrom contr goup and lower from treated group. Retive on intensity was given by viris color scale bar. Scale ar at lower left corner represents $1 \ \mathrm { c m }$ . Corpus callosum or brain stem were marked by white or orange dashed lines, respectively.

As expected, spatial preferences for different lipid species were observed in both positive mode (Figure S4) and negative mode (Figure S5). In positive mode, PC (34:1) and PS (28:1) were localized in the entire brain regions. The potassium adduct of PC (36:4) had a higher abundance in the hippocampus. PC (32:0) was distributed in the entire brain except the brain stem. [PC $( 3 8 { : } 4 ) { + } \mathrm { H } ] ^ { + } / [ \mathrm { P C } \ ( 3 6 { : } 1 ) { + } \mathrm { N a } ] ^ { + }$ and [PC $( 3 8 { : } 5 ) + \mathrm { H } ] ^ { + } / [ \mathrm { P C } ~ ( 3 6 { : } 2 ) + \mathrm { N a } ] ^ { + }$ were more abundant in the white matter (Figure S4). The observed distribution of PCs was in line with the reported study.23 Similarly, PIs, PSs, and PEs also showed anatomical distribution in the negative mode (Figure S5). However, the majority of identified lipids were not significantly regulated upon PM exposure in both positive and negative modes, indicating that the relatively short time of PM exposure did not cause a significant change in terms of overall lipids spatial distribution.

Surprisingly, only a few sulfatides (STs) were differentially modulated between control and exposure groups in our MSI analysis (Figure 1). Sulfatides are sulfated galactocerebrosides that present mainly in a myelin sheath containing axons24 and play vital roles in the regulation of cell differentiation,5 protein trafficking,26 immune response,27 and maintaining the normal function of the myelin sheath.28 Eight ST species detected in negative mode were downregulated in the corpus callosum (enclosed by a white dashed line in Figure 1) of the rat brains in the treatment group. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of the eight sulfatides indicated that intensity differences between the two groups were statistically significant $\mathrm { ( A U C > 0 . 7 5 ) }$ . Abundances of $\bar { \mathrm { S T } } \mathrm { ( d 1 8 { : } 1 / h 2 4 { : } 0 ) }$ $S \mathrm { T } \big ( \mathrm { d } 1 8 { : } 1 /$ h24:1), ST $\left( \mathrm { d } 1 8 { : } 1 / \mathrm { h } 2 2 { : } 0 \right)$ $\operatorname { S T } \bigl ( \mathrm { { d 1 8 : 1 } } / { 1 8 : 0 } \bigr )$ , and $S \mathrm { T } \big ( \mathrm { d } 1 8 { : } 1 /$ 22:0) were significantly decreased in the corpus callosum of exposed rats (Figure 1A-E). $\mathrm { S T } \big ( \mathrm { d } 1 8 { : } 1 / 2 2 { : } 0 \big )$ $S \mathrm { T } \big ( \mathrm { d } 1 8 { : } 1 /$ h18:0), $\mathrm { S T } \big ( \mathrm { d } 1 8 { : } 1 / 2 4 { : } 0 \big )$ , and $\mathrm { S T } \big ( \mathrm { d } 1 8 { : } 1 / 2 4 { : } 1 \big )$ were reduced in both the corpus callosum and brain stem (enclosed by orange dashed line in Figure 1). Statistical analyses of relative intensities of sulfatides are shown in Figure 2 and Figure S6. To further validate our MSI results, levels of sulfatides were determined by direct infusion ESI-Ms.22 Five sulfatides were successfully quantified and significantly reduced in the corpus callosum of PM-exposed rats, which is consistent with our MSI analysis (Figure S7). Consequently, our data indicated that real ambient PM exposure significantly reduced sulfatides abundances in the brain stem, corpus callosum, or entire white matter, which was not reported before.

White matter is found deeper in brains, formed by clusters of axons extended from neurons. The corpus callosum is the largest white matter body in CNS, connecting neurons of different brain regions through myelinated axons. The insulating myelin sheath of axons is essential for fast axon signaling,29 where sulfatides are one of the major and essential lipid species for normal function.28 Our observation of sulfatides reduction, therefore, implied potential damage to the myelin sheath by PM exposure, agreeing with reports from other groups 3031 More interestingly, emerging pieces of evidence have shown that sulfatide depletion was able to cause disease-like neuroinflammation and is potentially associated with neurodegenerative diseases.32-34 Consequently, expression levels of a panel of inflammatory markers were investigated in the isolated corpus callosum regions (Figure 3). Proinflammatory cytokines including Interleukin 6 (1l-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha $\left( T n f \ – \alpha \right)$ , and interleukin $1 \beta$ $\left( I l  – I \beta \right)$ were significantly upregulated in the exposure group, indicating activation of an inflammatory response in the corpus callosum. Activations of microglia and astrocytes commonly occur during neuroinflammation.35 The expression of activation markers for microglial (inducible nitric oxide synthase, iNos) and astrocyte (glial fibrillary acidic protein, Gfap) were also significantly increased upon PM exposure (Figure 3). Taken together, our data demonstrated that PM exposure-mediated sulfatide loss was associated with neuroinflammation in the corpus callosum of rat brains, indicating potential neurological damage effects of PM exposure.

The study was limited by the exposure time and sampling time points. In addition, it is not possible to distinguish if the observed spatial regulation of sulfatides in the brain was caused by PM exposure or by other environmental pollutants adsorbed or formed on PM. Therefore, detailed molecular mechanisms of how PM exposure induced sulfatides depletion and potential subsequent adverse effects on the brain remain to be explored in future studies.

In conclusion, for the first time, a spatial-specific downregulation of sulfatides was found to be associated with real ambient PM exposure in the corpus callosum and brain stem of SD rats by MSI. Neuroinflammation markers were found to be upregulated in the corpus callosum. Given the emerging association between neurodegeneration diseases and $\mathrm { P M } _ { 2 . 5 }$ exposure,9,10,36 our data further suggested a possible association of PM exposure with neurological damage via sulfatides reduction and associated neuroinflammation in the corpus callosum regions of PM-exposed rat brains.
