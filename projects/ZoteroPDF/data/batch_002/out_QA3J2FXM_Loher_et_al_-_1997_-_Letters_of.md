ABSTRACT: References continue to be a required part of selection systems in employment settings and higher education. Previous research on references has often involved atheoretical validation studies. We propose that the reference message itself is but one step in a communication process and that letter tone, content, and structure can be analyzed to determine their contribution to process outcomes. A sample of 85 reference statements was used to demonstrate potential antecedents, measures, and outcomes suggested by this conceptualization. Antecedents including letter characteristics were significantly related to readers' evaluations and accept or reject recommendations. Results from regression analyses indicated initial support for measures of letter tone, content, and structure in predicting readers' evaluations. A communication-based framework is pre. sented and implications for research and practice are discussed.

# INTRODUCTION

Most job candidates are asked to provide the name and telephone number of a personal reference (ASPA, 1983). Similarly, almost all applicants to graduate programs are required to submit reference letters (Range et al., 1991). In both cases, the reference may be an employer, instructor, or colleague who is assumed to have some knowledge of the candidate's background, attributes, and behavior. If contacted, the person may be asked to verify information, assess a candidate's qualities, or predict his or her likelihood for future success (Gatewood & Feild, 1990).

While references are a common part of selection systems, their usefulness has been questioned (e.g., Heneman & Heneman, 1994; Landy, 1989, Range et al., 1991). Criterion-related validity studies indicate that reference letter content often has a relatively low association with performance (Muchinsky, 1979). A meta-analysis by Reilly and Chao (1982) found a mean correlation of .14 between references and a global criterion. References have been criticized for low interrater agreement, leniency errors, restriction of range, and poor response rates (Schneider & Schmitt, 1986). The legal environment has also been blamed for reducing the effectiveness of references (e.g., Pamaro, 1988; Von der Embse & Wyse, 1985). For example, the predictive value of a reference may be reduced when liability concerns limit a previous employer to verification of the candidate's former job title and dates of employment with no comments on performance levels (Ryan & Lasek, 1991).

The existing research on letters of reference has been atheoretical; scoring systems and validation studies dominate the literature. Understanding of references and their role in the selection process might be improved by development of conceptual models (Baxter, Brock, Hill, & Rozelle, 1981). The overall purpose of this paper is to introduce and examine the antecedents and measures suggested by such a framework. For the present study the terms reference letter, reference statement, and letter of recommendation refer to an unstructured, written description of an applicant's behavior or personal qualities as provided by a third party.

# Conceptual Framework

The reference letter itself can be viewed as one part of a general communication process, involving a message source, the message itself, and the message's recipient (Ilgen, Fisher, & Taylor, 1979). Figure 1 presents the general latent components of this process and the manifest variables examined in the present study.

As depicted in Figure 1, the reference process includes at least two communication stages. First, the person to be described in the letter (i.e., the applicant or initial "source") contacts a potential reference writer. This is the message to writer link in our model. For example, a male student who is about to graduate with an undergraduate degree might request a reference letter from a female instructor (i.e., the initial "recipient"). The applicant may provide a resume or other information to the letter writer, such as whether or not the letter is confidential and to what programs the letter should be sent. We focused on two variables to represent the message to writer component: letter confidentiality and undergraduate grade point average (GPA).

In the second communication stage, the writer's perceptions of the applicant are transmitted to the reader through the reference letter itself, the message to the reader component in our model. After controlling for source characteristics such as the author's credibility and power (Ilgen et al., 1979), the message's tone, content, and structure should affect the reader's reactions (Mehrabian, 1965; Muchinsky, 1979; Wiens, Jackson, Manaugh, & Matarazzo, 1969). For instance, in the earlier example, the tone of the letter might be affected by the writer's perception of the fit between the knowledge, skills, and abilities of the student and the role for which he is applying. Research on cognitive factors in performance evaluation (e.g., Landy & Farr, 1983) suggests the possibility that reference writers might first use the information available or provided to them (e.g., class performance, the target position or school) to categorize the applicant within their own schemata (e.g., "average" performer; "top tier' school). The writer might then produce their "standard" letter consistent with the chosen summary schema (e.g., "this job or school is beyond the student's abilities"). The letter's extremely positive or lukewarm tone might convey this schema and affect the reader's view of the applicant. One purpose of the present study was to examine the extent to which a readers' reactions were consistent with a measure of the message's tone.

Figure 1 Conceptual Framework of Reference Letter Process

The effect of the message's content on reader reactions was also investigated in this study. For the most direct measures of reference letter content, we used the presence or absence of specific behavioral examples (e.g., Knouse, 1983) and the inclusion of negative information about the candidate.

Because the tone and content of most reference letters are at least superficially positive (Muchinsky, 1979; Schneider & Schmitt, 1986), the reader may use one or several structural characteristics of the message to infer the writer's "true"' evaluation of an applicant. For example, Peres and Garcia (1962) examined 625 letters of recommendation sent to a nuclear research laboratory. They found that candidates were frequently described by trait names or adjectives. After eliminating duplicates, a list of 170 adjectives was developed. The adjectives were reduced to a 5-factor solution (mental agility, vigor, dependability-reliability, urbanity, cooperation-consideration). Adjectives in the mental agility category were best at discriminating between job performance levels. Whitcomb and Bryan (1988; see also Aamodt, Bryan, & Whitcomb, 1993; Bryan, 1989; Whitcomb, 1989) examined the criterion-related validity of the Peres and Garcia (1962) categories for predicting graduate school grades. Whitcomb and Bryan found that the number of adjectives placed in the mental agility category was associated with graduate school GPA $( r = . 3 2$ $\mathbf { \nabla } p < . 0 5 )$

An explanation for why adjectives or other structural characteristics of a reference letter might predict future performance had been lacking until Semin and Fiedler (1988) introduced their theory of social cognition and language. They proposed that communicators learn that words from certain linguistic categories have implications for a receiver's perceptions and attributions. Semin and Fiedler's system has four categories: (1) descriptive action verb (DAV); (2) interpretive action verb (IAV); (3) state verb (SV); and (4) adjective (ADJ). DAVs refer to an observable action with a clear beginning and end that lacks positive or negative connotations. Semin and Fiedler's examples for this category include the verbs call, talk, and stare. IAVs are observable and have a distinct beginning and end, but also include positive or negative semantic connotations. Help, cheat, inhibit and imitate were given as examples of IAVs. SVs involve mental or emotional states that are not objectively verifiable by an observer and have no clear beginning or end. Semin and Fiedler listed hate, notice, and envy as examples. ADJs are clustered into a single category in the system and included words like extraverted, able, and necessary.

Semin and Fiedler found support for their categories in two studies using simple, artificial sentences. More importantly, their conceptualization has not previously been examined as a way to content analyze more complex written material such as that found in reference letters. The present study provided such an application by using a modified Semin and Fiedler system to assess the structural characteristics of references.

Other studies have examined the predictive value of several additional characteristics of reference letters. These include the effects of a writer's use of first name, last name, or formal titles when discussing male versus female applicants (Cowan & Kasen, 1984), waiving the right to review the letter (Ceci & Peters, 1984; Shaffer & Tomarelli, 1981), the organizational affiliation of the writer (Rim, 1976), and the number of words in the letter (Mehrabian, 1965; Wiens et al., 1969). From this list, we selected waiving the right to review the letter as a measure of information that would probably be presented to the letter writer, and the number of words in the letter as an alternative measure of the reference letter's structure.

Figure 1 separates the reader from the organizational decision maker to acknowledge that the roles are not always held by the same person. Additional information available to decision makers might include results from other selection procedures (e.g., standardized tests, interviews; Range et al., 1991), previous contact with the candidate, discussions with other members of a selection panel, or greater knowledge of organizational needs. Perceptions from reading reference letters may be used by decision makers to subjectively check for convergence with results from other measures.

Again, the general purpose of this study was to determine which reference letter characteristics (i.e., predictors) were most highly related to reader reactions (i.e., the criteria). These relationships were explored in the broader context of our conceptual framework by examining the incremental value of the message characteristics at various stages of the communication process for predicting subsequent reader reactions. Consistent with Figure 1 and core to our framework, we predicted that measures of a reference letter's tone, content, and structure would combine to predict readers' reactions to that letter.

# METHOD

# Sample

The archival sample included reference statements for 85 applicants (51 females and 34 males) to a Master's program in IndustrialOrganizational (I-O) psychology. Of these applicants, 48 were subsequently offered admittance into the program and 37 were rejected over a period of several years. The majority of the reference statements $( \mathbf { N } =$ 62) were responses to an open-ended item that appeared on the standard university recommendation form. The remaining statements $( \mathbf { N } =$ 23) were letters of recommendation attached to the standard university form. Several previous studies have utilized graduate student references (e.g., Aamodt et al., 1993; Daehnert & Carter, 1987; Federici & Schuerger, 1974; Rawls, Rawls, & Harrison, 1969; Stake, Walker, $\&$ Speno, 1981; Zeleznik, Hojat, & Veloski, 1983). Most I-O psychology graduate programs require letters of recommendation as part of the application process (SIOP, 1992).

Although most candidates had three references, we chose to randomly select one statement per applicant. This procedure was consistent with the goals of our study to gauge reader reactions to a message from a single source. Given that Aamodt et al. (1993) and Baxter et al. (1981) reported a correlation of about .40 across reference letters for the same candidate, subsequent research might attempt to investigate reader attempts to combine messages from multiple sources.

# Procedure

Archival program records were searched to identify the application information for each of the 85 subjects. Message characteristics (i.e., the predictors) were either available directly from an applicant's file or coded by members of the research team after rating independently and then discussing any differences. Letter confidentiality, tone (i.e., overall evaluation by the writer), and undergraduate grade point average were the message characteristics extracted directly from the files. Message content (i.e., behavioral examples and negative information) and structure (i.e., number of action verbs, state verbs, adjectives, and overall words) were the characteristics coded by the research team. Two coders were used. Coding was done in two stages: (1) coders independently evaluated each reference statement on the content and structural characteristics; and (2) coders compared evaluations and discussed all differences in order to arrive at a consensus value for each measure.

Reader reactions, the primary criteria, were obtained from two graduate students in the I-O program who were unaware of the purposes of the study and were not members of the original admissions committee. These two readers were different from the coders who rated letter content and structural characteristics. The readers independently evaluated all 85 reference statements without any information about the writer (e.g., name and institution) or the applicant (e.g., Graduate Record Exam scores and undergraduate GPA). An overall rating and an accept/reject recommendation were obtained from each reader and averaged, as if empirically combining the reactions of a selection committee.

# Predictor Measures: Message to Writer

Confidentiality. An indication of whether or not the statement would remain confidential was presented on the standard recommendation form to all letter writers. Thus, each letter in this study was classified as either confidential or not. Ceci and Peters (1984) found that candidates who waived the right to review their reference letters tended to receive less favorable statements.

Undergraduate Grade Point Average (UGPA). It was assumed that some knowledge of a candidate's undergraduate grade point average (UGPA) was also probably available to the reference writer. UGPA on a 4.0 scale was obtained from each candidate's application materials.

# Predictor Measures: Message to Reader

Letter Tone. The standard recommendation form asked the reference writer to indicate an overall expectation for candidate performance at the Masters level (e.g., ${ \bf 1 } =$ Unsatisfactory, ${ \mathfrak { z } } =$ Satisfactory with some reservations, through ${ \pmb 6 = }$ Distinctly Outstanding). Although this rating was not seen by the readers in this study, the rating was used to reflect the writer's overall evaluation of a candidate and was treated as an operationalization of the letter's overall tone.

Letter Content. Two measures were used to assess content. First, the coders determined whether a reference statement contained any behavioral examples ( $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { 1 } =$ none; $\mathbf { 2 } = \mathbf { s o m e } ,$ . Knouse (1983) reported that references containing specific examples of behavior received higher reader evaluations than did statements without examples. Next, the coders evaluated whether any negative information was included in the reference statement ( $\mathbf { 1 } =$ some negative; ${ \bf 2 } \ =$ all positive). As described earlier, one consensus value per applicant resulted from the two-stage process used by the coders.

Letter Structure. Four measures of letter structure were examined. Mehrabian (1965) and Wiens et al. (1969) argued that the number of words in a reference statement was a good indicator of writer attitude toward a candidate in settings where social constraints limited expression of negative information. Therefore, the number of words in the statement became the first measure of structure. Other measures of structure were adapted from Semin and Fiedler's (1988) research in psycholinguistic theory. A pilot study revealed that even with extensive operational definitions and practice, coders could not consistently distinguish between the DAV and IAV categories. These two categories were therefore combined into a single set labeled as action verbs (AV). The other measures of structure were the number of state verbs (SVs) and adjectives (ADJs) in the statement. Values for AVs, SVs, and ADJs were adjusted for the number of words in a statement to avoid confounding with letter length. Again, each applicant was assigned the coder consensus value on each predictor.

# Criteria Measures: Reader Reactions

In order to isolate the effects of the letter per se on the reader, all information concerning the writer (e.g., rank and institution) and the applicant (e.g., GRE scores) was not available to the two independent readers. Information about inter-rater agreement is presented below under Results.

Reader Overall Rating. Readers used a 7-point Likert-type scale (ranging from ${ \bf 1 } =$ Very Poor; to $\mathbf { 7 } \ : =$ Very Good) to make an overall candidate rating. An overall mean rating across readers was calculated for each candidate.

Reader Recommendation. Each reader made a recommendation to accept or reject a candidate $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot \mathbf { 1 } \ =$ Reject; ${ \mathfrak { L } } =$ Accept). Recommendations were averaged across readers so that each applicant would have one composite recommendation.

# RESULTS

Overall means and standard deviations for all variables are presented in Table 1; correlations are presented in Table 2. To be consistent with the conceptual framework of the study (see Figure 1), description of the correlational results proceeds from top to bottom of the matrix in Table 2.

Correlations. The two operational measures of message to writer, confidentiality of the reference statement and undergraduate grade point average, were not significantly correlated $\mathbf { \sigma } ( r = . 0 2 )$ with each other. Confidentiality did not exhibit any significant associations with the tone or content measures. Among the structure measures, it was significantly associated with the relative number of state verbs that appeared in the reference statement $( r = . 3 8 , p < . 0 1 )$ . In other words, statements open to review by the applicant were associated with the writer's proportionately greater use of verbs linked to mental or emotional states that cannot be objectively verified. Confidentiality was not significantly correlated with the criteria (i.e., reader ratings and reject/accept recommendations).

The second message to writer variable, undergraduate grade point average, did not significantly correlate with the structure measures, but was associated with letter tone $( r = . 2 7 $ $\mathbf { \nabla } p < . 0 5 )$ and inclusion of negative versus positive information $( r = . 3 1 $ $\mathbf { \nabla } p < . 0 1 )$ . In effect, applicants with higher grades were more likely to be given higher ratings for expected future performance and letters that were entirely positive.

For the outcome measures, grades were significantly correlated with the readers' reactions, as assessed by the average of their overall ratings for a statement $( r = . 3 4 , p < . 0 1 )$ and the composite recommendation to reject or accept an applicant $( r = . 3 0 , p < . 0 1 )$ . Such associations are interesting given that readers only had access to the reference statements and were not given direct quantitative information about applicants' grades.

Among the message to reader variables, letter tone was reflected in proportionately greater use of state verbs $\ l ( r \ = \ \ l . 2 4$ $\mathbf { \varepsilon } _ { p } < \mathbf { \varepsilon } . 0 5 )$ and the exclusion of any negative information about the applicant $( r = . 4 6 , p <$ .01). The number of words in the statement was associated with inclusion of behavioral examples $\ l ( r \ = \ \ l . 5 5$ $p < . 0 1 )$ . In effect, more words were used in statements that described specific events or behaviors. Use of action verbs and state verbs was positively correlated $( r = . 3 1 $ $p <$ .01).

Although they did not have direct access to the ratings upon which the measure was based, tone was significantly correlated with readers' ratings $( r = . 4 7$ $\mathbf { \nabla } p < . 0 1 )$ and accept/reject recommendations $( r = . 3 5 ,$ $\mathbf { \nabla } p < . 0 1 )$ . Among the measures of letter structure, readers tended to give higher ratings to longer statements $( r \ = \ . 2 5 , p < . 0 5 )$ and were more likely to recommend that the applicant be accepted $( r = . 4 1$ $\mathbf { \nabla } p < . 0 1 )$ The other structure measures (i.e., proportionate frequency of action verbs, state verbs, and adjectives) were not significantly associated with the readers' reactions. For the content measures, inclusion of behavioral examples was not significantly associated with readers' reactions. However, exclusion of negative information was correlated with readers' ratings $( r \ = \ . 5 0 , p < . 0 1 )$ and recommendations for acceptance $( r = . 2 7 ,$ $\mathbf { \gamma } _ { p } < . 0 5 )$

For the outcome measures, the combined values of the readers' overall ratings were strongly associated with composite values of their recommendations to accept or reject $( r = . 8 2 , p < . 0 1 )$ . Use of the rating composite appears well justified given that the individual overall ratings of applicants' letters correlated .73 between the two readers. The readers agreed exactly on ratings for 32 applicants $(38 \% )$ and were within one rating point of each other for 45 cases $(53 \% )$

Regression Analyses. Hierarchical regression analyses were used to examine the incremental contributions of the predictors in relation to the conceptual framework. In one set of analyses, the variables were entered as two blocks, with all variables in a block entered concurrently. Each block was examined for its relative contribution to the explanation of additional variance in the criterion (Cohen & Cohen, 1983). Given the high degree of conceptual and empirical relatedness between the two criteria, the composite reader overall rating was used as the criterion.

Using a top-down approach to the conceptual framework in Figure 1, the message to writer block (i.e., confidentiality and undergraduate grade point average), explained a significant amount of variance in the criterion (i.e., READ-RATE). The squared multiple correlation for this message to writer block was .12 $( F = \mathbf { 3 . 8 7 }$ $p < . 0 5 )$ . The subsequent message to reader block explained a significant amount of additional criterion variance $( \Delta R ^ { 2 } \ = \ . { \bar { 3 } } 3$ ${ \pmb F } = \ 4 . 3 3$ $p \ < \ . 0 1 )$ . In other words, the results support the notion that at least some of the variables in the message to reader block contributed incrementally to prediction of readers' ratings. Alternatively, a bottom-up approach indicated that the message to writer block did not explain additional unique variance in the readers' ratings $( \Delta R ^ { 2 } = . 0 1$ ${ \pmb F } = \mathbf { 0 . 6 3 }$ , NS) beyond the message to reader block $\bf ( R ^ { 2 } = \mathcal { \bar { 4 } } 3 )$

Further analyses examined the individual predictors. The regression analysis in Table 3 presents results from an exploration of the relative contribution of the predictors by combining the hierarchical topdown approach with stepwise regression within each block. Using this strategy, undergraduate GPA tentatively emerged within the message to writer block as the primary contributor towards prediction of readers' ratings. From the message to reader block, statement tone, inclusion or exclusion of negative information, and number of words in the reference statement explained additional unique variance. Consistent with their ordering in the conceptual framework, examination of the overall beta weights reveals that the contribution of grades was no longer significant after the message to reader variables enter the regression equation.

Subsequent analyses used an analytic strategy proposed by Baron and Kenny (1986) to test for mediation of the relation between undergraduate GPA and the readers' ratings composite by the significant message to reader variables (i.e., tone, negative information, and number of words in the reference letter). Tone and negative information emerged as potential mediators while number of words in the statement did not meet the criteria set by Baron and Kenny (1986). Results of these analyses are available from the authors.

Other Results. Selected measures were examined further to facilitate interpretation of the analyses. Consistent with observations from other researchers (e.g., Range et al., 1991), the values on several variables were somewhat restricted. For example, $81 \%$ $( \mathbf { N } = 6 9 ,$ of the applicants waived their right to review the reference statement (i.e., only 5 applicants did not waive their right, and 11 applicants left the item blank). Relatively few statements included behavioral examples $( \mathbf { N } = \mathbf { 1 7 } )$ , and slightly less than a quarter of the statements $\left( \mathbf { N } = 2 0 \right)$ included \*negative" information. An examination of key phrases identified by the coders suggested that statements trying to explain an applicant's grades or describing an applicant as "shy" were the most frequent types of negative information.

# DISCUSSION

The results were generally supportive of the conceptual framework. Both the message to writer and message to reader blocks contributed to prediction of readers' reactions. As suggested by their ordering in the framework, the message to reader variables were associated with prediction of unique variance in the criterion after controlling for the message to writer measures. Conversely, message to writer variables did not explain a significant amount of unique variance in readers' reactions after the message to reader block was entered.

In terms of significant beta weights, the three most important variables in the overall regression equation were measures representing tone, content, and structure. All of these variables were in the message to reader block. The success of the indirect measure of statement tone was somewhat surprising given that the readers were never directly exposed to this rating. Inclusion of information that might be interpreted as negative was associated with more negative reader reactions and representative of letter content. Finally, consistent with Mehrabian's (1965)

findings, number of words in the statement (a structure measure) was positively related to readers' reactions.

Less important predictors of reader reactions included confidentiality and undergraduate grade point average from the message to writer block. Refusing to waive the right to review the letter occurred infrequently. The assumption that an applicant's grades might serve as input to the reference writer appears justified given the number of letters that mentioned grades. Tone and inclusion of negative information emerged as possible mediators between grades and reader overall ratings. Ironically, writers' attempts to describe the constraints surrounding less-than-superior grades may be perceived as negative information (Range et al., 1991). This is directly analogous to a job reference's attempts to explain a candidate's mediocre past work performance or reasons for leaving a previous organization. Knowing that most applicants have positive reference letters, readers may attempt to "read between the lines' to infer a writer's "true"' evaluation or feelings about a given candidate. An unfortunate outcome from this process may be that attempts to explain environmental constraints or describe even minor developmental needs are perceived as negative information (Range et al., 1991).

Behavioral descriptions, action verbs, state verbs, and adjectives from the message to reader block were less predictive of reader reactions than expected. Use of behavioral examples was not significantly associated with more positive reader reactions. Behavioral examples were relatively rare in our sample, but the readers had received extensive training in their I-O coursework on the importance of behaviorally-based measures in selection. Alternatively, Range et al. (1991) suggested that readers may view such descriptions as "red flags" or inappropriate, perhaps because they do not fit the stereotype for reference letters (Baxter et al., 1981).

Although theoretically appealing, Semin and Fiedler's (1988) linguistics-based measures (i.e., action verbs, state verbs, and adjectives) were not significantly associated with readers' reactions. While, Aamodt et al. (1993) found some support for the criterion-related validity of a modified Peres and Garcia (1962) adjective scoring scheme, their study focused on prediction of graduate grades and teaching evaluations and not on reader reactions.

When discussing reference letters, Heneman and Heneman (1994) recommended the use of standardized scoring systems like the one developed by Aamodt et al. (1993). Based on the results of the present study, we would not recommend use of the Semin and Fiedler (1988) categories as the basis for such a scoring system. Even though increased reliability and validity are paramount goals, the time costs and difficulty of using different scoring systems are also relevant practice issues.

We found consistent scoring of action verbs, state verbs, and adjectives to be both time consuming and difficult. In contrast, it was relatively quick and easy to count the number of words in the reference letter and to determine the presence or absence of negative information or behavioral examples. Use of consensus scoring helped to efficiently resolve any differences.

# Future Research

The conceptual framework presented here is useful as a tool for organizing a fragmented literature. It also suggests avenues for future research. One strategy would be to focus on development of a better understanding of the reference process using the framework's major components. To illustrate, message to writer and message to reader elements might be examined more closely for their impact on the reader. Baxter et al. (1981) reported that reference letters in their sample were idiosyncratic. That is, letters written by the same author about different candidates were more similar to each other than were letters written by different authors about the same candidate. Manipulation of the information provided to writers and exploration of consistencies within and between authors in their messages to readers could be used to examine this hypothesis.

Given the fairly extensive research on cognitive processes in performance appraisal and social cognition (e.g., Landy & Farr, 1983), it was not surprising that tone emerged as a significant predictor of reader reactions. How authors send and readers derive a recommendation's tone is an issue for further study.

Alternatively, research might focus on identification and testing of additional framework components. For example, the role of readers' reactions relative to other predictors in an organization's selection system might be examined. Decision makers may use reactions to reference letters to check for convergence with other measures. From a person perception standpoint (Baxter et al., 1981), this could become a self-fulfilling prophecy if knowledge of scores on other predictors biases the reader's perceptions of the reference statement (i.e., "What I want to see is what I see" in the unstructured reference letter). Therefore, one might sequence predictor information about a candidate in various orders and then examine the effects on perceptions of reference letters.
