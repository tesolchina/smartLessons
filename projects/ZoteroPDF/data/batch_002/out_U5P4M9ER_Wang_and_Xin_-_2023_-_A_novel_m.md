Multi-dimensional analysis   
Disciplinary variation   
Diachronic change   
Genre variation

The purpose of this study is to profile the genre of reply, response, and rejoinder articles (3R) on a corpus of 480 texts sourced from the disciplines of History, Linguistics, Biology, Psychology, Chemistry, Physics, Politics, and Economics. A novel multi-dimensional model based on 124 linguistic features was developed on five functional dimensions: i. Literate vs. oral production, i. Non-technical stance vs. specialized informational density, ii. Ethos-oriented non-narrative vs. logos-oriented narrative concerns, iv. Elaborated persuasion, and v. Overt expression of evaluation. The findings concerning disciplinary and diachronic variations across dimensions suggest: i. provided that 3R articles are heavily stance-loaded, relatively informative, and eloquently persuasive forms of academic discourse in nature, the genre of 3R in soft disciplines is literal, nontechnical attitudinal, ethos-oriented non-narrative, elaborately persuasive and overtly evaluative, whereas it is oral, specialized information-dense narrative, logos-oriented persuasive and evaluative in hard disciplines; ii. the dimensions of evaluation, informativeness, and persuasiveness are the functional constants of the 3R genre across disciplines and time, despite significant discrepancies detected in the functional representation of oral/literate style and elaborated persuasion. These findings are relevant to the study of disciplinary rhetoric and may contribute to advanced genre pedagogy in EAP, ESP and EPP studies.

# 1. Introduction

Recent decades have witnessed linguistic characterizations of academic writing conducted in the arenas of EAP, ESP and EPP from corpus-based, genre-specific, and discipline-specific perspectives. Among the fullspectrum of academic genres, one type of research receiving the most scholarly atention resides in the interpersonal metafunction of academic publications (Gray & Biber, 2012; Hunston, 2010; Hyland & Jiang, 2019). Even though consensus has been reached regarding the stance-laden nature of academic discourse, disagreements remained in the specificity and granularity of the description of author-reader interactions in academic writing (Biber & Gray, 2016; Hyland, 2009; Hyland & Jiang, 2019; Lu et al., 2021; Martin et al., 2019).

Reply, response and rejoinder articles (henceforth abbreviated as 3R), of which the primary communicative function is to chal. lenge the counterclaims raised in previous publications" (Afros, 2014, p. 79), are distinguished in that they \*engage in an argument that is more overt and personal than that found in typical research articles" (Hunston, 2005, p. 2). Such explicit linguistic representation of challenges, conflicts and confrontations between authors and target respondents illuminates how authorial stances, informativeness and persuasion are manipulated to defend authors, refute challengers, persuade academic audiences, and ultimately aintain authors' intellectual reputations in the world of disciplinary knowledge.

To gain a deeper insight into the academic discourse of explicit confrontation and implicit evaluation in diffrent disciplinary paradigms, the present research focuses on the genre of 3R. The method of multi-dimensional analysis (henceforth abbreviated as MDA) is adopted to quantitatively profil the lexico-grammar and generic features of academic conflict (Biber, 198), and to provide empirical consolidation to earlier studies highlighting persuasive and politeness strategies used in 3R articles.

Section 2 presents a brief overview of recent iterature on 3R articles and three research questions drawn from previous research gaps. Section 3 provides the corpus composition, the methodology of MDA and procedures of statistical analysis and a sketch of the situational featuring of 3R articles. In the fourth section, a novel MDA model is presented with functional interpretations. Registerial comparison of functional dimensions across disciplines and time and functional constants of 3R articles are thoroughly scrutinized in Sections 5 and 6. The last section summarizes the findings and pedagogical implications, and makes suggestions for future reearch.

# 2. Reply, response and rejoinder articles

The genre of 3R is the crucial venue of disciplinary engagement adhering to the defence of researchers academic integrity and the refutationf urortd lams in th onstrctiof scintific knowledge. ts sole uroe i tefute iutnts, justify prir efforts or make amends and explanations to the existing research. Thus, the 3R genre is a natural fusion of evaluation and persuasion.

Together with book reviews, review article, peer-reviews, and commentarie, 3R articles are frequently categorized as an eval. uative type of discourse in the review genre (Gray, 2015). On the one hand, it shares intellectual ccountabilit with the genre of review, both of which contribute farly minimally to the construction of disciplinary knowledge (Zou & Hyland, 2020, p. 99). On the Other, the enre of 3R differentiates itelf from the review genre by ffering ittle to nothing to the evaluation of fllow reearchers works (Birhan, 2021; Hunston, 2005). The similarities and discrepancies between the genres of 3R and review suggest the functional variety of communicative purposes in academic conflict and confrontation, clling for tudie to untangle the variations and tactics of evaluation and argumentation in the genre of 3R.

On the evaluative ide of the review genre, relevant literature has highlighted how academic criticisms, conflicts and confronta tions are realized by stance markers and evaluative constructions (Cheng & Unsworth, 2016; Vassileva, 2022). Provided that negative evaluatin is typically acted with iteary xpertie intelligce, and professinal comptece (Nass& Yen, 2010, p. 49),  is not surprising that criticism is more apparent in academic reviews, where the fundamental communicative purpose is to evaluate the quality of texts, the contribution of scholars, and the target research (Zou & Hyland, 2020, p. 98).In a positioning paper investigating stance in 3R article, Hunston (2005, p. 2) expands the discussion of conflict reolution strategies in research artices (Hunston, 1993) to the 3R genre, and differentiates how value and attrition are conveyed in subtypes of "conflit exchange"-- initiating and conflict articles'. In the ltter genre, negative values are achieved by criticizing opponents ill-conformity to disciplinary conventions and knowledge, thus contributing to the falsification of claims with superior stances. To claim authority and establish credibility in the academic community, interactional metadiscourse markers (e.g., self-mentions, hedges and boosters) are employed in large amounts, suggesting authors' inclination to present personal judgments, to moderate (counter-Jarguments, and to highlight ideas in conflict articles (Saidi & Karami, 2021). The aleged superiority of intellectual tance and professional competence in conflict artice is often interpreted as the conduct of impolitenes, complaints, and criticisms. For instance, Khosravi and Babaii (2017) and Khosravi (2015) confirm that conflicts are central to the balance of power dynamism in the academic community where on-record strategies of impoliteness are envisaged as a direct atack insult or denia of face, and conversely off-record strategies are mitigated as sarcasm or withholding of politeness Despite minor differences in emotional intensity in the review genre, the bulk of studies concludes that scholars in hard and soft disciplines unanimously seek consensus with their colleagues by positive concurring, or engage in the confrontation of counterclaims and disputants by negative assessments. Profound and comprehensive as they may be, however, previous studies concerning the 3R genre are of a narrow disiplinary range- Linguistics (Cheng & Unsworth, 2016; Khosravi, 2015; Khosravi & Babai, 2017; Saidi & Karami, 2021), and Archeology (Livnat, 2014), neglcting temporal fluctuations. This leaves room for the investigation of evaluative intensity in the 3R genre across disciplinary paradigms and temporal unfolding.

On the persuasive side of the review genre, the major line of research investigates various argumentative strategies for convincing target opponents (Afros, 2014, 2022; Livnat, 2014; Martin-Martin & Burgess, 2004; Vassilea, 2022; Zou & Hyland, 2020). Following the Aristotelian rhetorical tradition of argumentation, logos' (targeting discipline-specific arguments), "ethos (engaging in argu. ments related to the trustworthiness of authors, and \*pathos' (aiming to appeal to the values of disciplinary communities) are assumed as major persuasive strategies in Linguistic 3R articles (Afros, 2014), and represented by a wide array of creative rhetoric devices, such as puns, idioms, and incongruities i formalit (Afro, 2022) The arumentative stratey of ethos can be further classified as either to be established by the combination of supporting claims or to attack the rivals ethos by discrediting of academic reputations (Livnat, 2014). Unlike the employment of "mitigating" persuasive strategies in book reviews (Martin-Martin & Burgess 2004; Zou & Hyland, 2020), the genre of 3R harnesses a wide array of argumentative schemes akin to Vassileva's (2022, p. 5) \*false premises" "questioning the premises and/or the conclusion", \*the conclusion does not fllow the premises", "probation', "defeasible, re buttals', and "personal atack" sampled from review articles in Linguistics. Most of these studies propose that the argumentative schemes of the review genre resemble those of other written academic genres, i. discussion sections of research artice (Cheng & Unsworth, 2016) and grant proposals (Matzler, 2021). The influencing variable under scrutiny is discipline, where resources of argumentative schemes are discussed in mono-disciplinary studie i. Linguistics, Archeology, or Engineering). Scant research has been conducted on the potential variable of time, and the confluence of intra-textual features and inter-textual variations of the 3R genre.

To address these research lacunae, the present study quantifies the inguistic features of 3R articles, seeking to profile the disciplinary and diachronic characteristics in the discourse of academic conflict and to provide advanced students with lingustic models in the future composition of academic texts. The list of research queries is presented as follows:

RQ 1. What functional dimensions can be found in the 3R corpus by conducting Exploratory Factor Analysis?   
RQ 2. To what extent do disciplines differ in the functional dimensions of 3R articles?   
RQ 3. How do the functional dimensions of 3R articles change over time? In what ways do the pattrns of diachronic variations   
differ in soft and hard disciplines?

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. The corpus of reply, response, and rejoinder articles

This study utilized aself-compiled multi-disciplinary corpus of 3R articles (approximately 0.74 millon) randomly retrieved with the Boolean formulas "CC) $\mathrm { T I } =$ (reply)) OR $\mathrm { { T I } = }$ (response)) OR $\mathrm { T I } =$ (rejoinder)) AND LA $: = 1$ (English)) AND DT $\backsimeq$ (Database Review OR Discussion OR Editorial Material OR Expression of Concern OR Letter OR Note OR Publication with Expression of Concern OR Re view)) AND WC $\underline { { \underline { { \mathbf { \Pi } } } } } =$ (disciplinary x)) AND $\mathbf { P Y = }$ (publication year)" from the Web of Science (Wos) Core Collections. To ensure generic homogeneity, each text was manually examined for aspects such as tites, document types, languages, subjects and year of publication to avoid falsely-retrieved articles regarding \*response' as research subjects before the extraction of raw corpora. Extr-linguistic features of the corpora (e.g. gender, language background, seniority of authors, impact factor, citation ranking, and publisher of the journals) were not considered.

The variable of discipline was set as eight randomly-selected Wos categories from four broad disciplinary groupings in the British Academic Written Englis (BAwE) corpus clssification, i. Arts and Humanities (History & Linguistics, Social Sciences (Economics & Politics), Lif Sciences (Biology & Psychology), and Physical Sciences (Chemistry & Physics) (Heuboeck et al., 2010). To reflect \*the continum of disciplinary specificity" and the continuum of academic knowledge", the four disiplinary groupings were further distinguished by the soft (Arts and Humanities & Social Sciences) and hard (Life Sciences & Physical Sciences) knowledge domains (Durrant, 2017; Gardner et a., 2019, . 649; Hyland, 2009, p. 63, p. 63). The variable of time was set as five consecutive periods from the first documented WoS publication year 1980 to the most recent decade 2020. This resulted in a total number f 480 texts randomly sampled from eight WoS categories across five consecutive time phases. Table 1 below ilustrates the basic composition of the 3R corpus.

In the proces of corpus cleaning, text samples were converted to UTF-8 format and labelled as "Soft/Hard WoS category X publication year number. Miscellaneous features, including headings, fooers, diagrams, tables, formula, references, notes, and publication information, were removed. However, n-text quotations were retained because they are "a part of the language of the article itelf (Gray, 2015, p. 45). The final phase of data preparation was the manual review of 15 percent of processed texts to ensure no extra-linguistic features were included that may interfere with statistical results.

# 3.2. Corpus annotation for multi-dimensional analysis

The dominant approachto idenifying clusters of linguistic features that occurred in different situational contexts is MDA. Powered by statistical modelling methods like Exploratory Factor Analysi (henceforth abbreviated as EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis analyses of academic discourse utilizing MDA have suggested significant ifferences i the cross-comparison of academic genres and disciplines (Egbert & Staples, 2019). The premise of running MDA is t determine the number of linguistic fatures that best represent the demographic of the target register in a way that \*no a priori commitment is made concerning the importance of an individual linguistic feature or the validity of a previous functional interpretation during the selection of features" (Biber, 1988, p. 72) Considering the evaluative and persuasive nature of 3R articles, the set of features $( \mathrm { N } = 1 2 4 )$ ) adopted in the present study is comprised of:

i. 68 P0S taggings (Biber, 1988), such as average word length, type-token ratio (set at the default of 400 tokens), and atributive adjective;   
ii. 48 stance-loaded semantic taggings (Biber, 2006), such as attitudinal stance adverbials to clauses controlled by evaluative adjectives, and that clauses controlled by factual nouns;   
ii. 8 additional linguistic features reflecting \*prevalence in published academic writig", as recommended by gbert (2015 p.9), i. e., pre-modifying nouns, phrasal verbs, common and academic lexical bundles, Core Vocabulary List and Academic Vocabulary List (1-500 and 501-3000 words) respectively (Gardner & Davies, 2014).

The frequency counts of the 124 linguistic features were retrieved and documented by ready-made corpus toos in light of praticality. Nini's (2019) multi-dimensional anals tagger (MAT) was used to automaticall generate the normalized frequency of 68 POS taggings per 100 tokens. ancsbox 6.0 (Brezina, Weill-Tesser,  McEnery, 2021) was adopted to calculate the normalied frequency of 56 linguistic featres by searching wordists with P restrictions, for instance, that lauses controlled by factal nouns were restricted with the regular expression \*N. ${ } ^ { \ast } \mathrm { I N }$ /that'. The frequencies of 124 features were then normalized as per 1000 tokens (except for type/token ratio and average word length) for subsequent disciplinary and diachronic comparisons.

It shall be noted that overlapping between grammatical and semantic features was inevitable in previous MDA studies and the present study. This was addressed by conforming to the protocol of most MDA studies: commencing with subordinate categories in the initial run of the FA, and replacing them with uperordinate categories when necessary Egbert & Staples, 2019; Gardner et al., 2019)

# 3.3. Situational featuring of the 3R genre

The description of situational featuring of genres in MDA studies helps pin down the distinctive situational characteristics of registers, and provides accessto the interpretation of functional dimensions of the gere (Friginal & Hard, 2019). Thus, the situational context of the 3R genre is sketched from the perspectives of participant, relations among participants, channels, production circumstances, settings, communicative purposes, and topics (Table 2).

The situational featuring has explicitl elaborated the field, tenor and mode of 3R articles (Halliday & Mathessen, 2014), highlighting the interpersonal as well as the ideational and textual aspects of the genre.

# 3.4. Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted to generate a bottom-up factorial model that best captures the linguisic representation of the   
3R genre (RQ 1), and to compare disciplinary (RQ 2) and diachronic changes (RQ 3) on the functional dimensions outlined in RQ 1. For the first objective, FA was selected for is strength in interreting ew datasts andnew relationships among registers (Biber,   
1988; Egbert & Staples, 2019, p. 128). The Principle Axis Factoring analysis extracted linguistic features that can be further loaded   
onto interpretable dimensions of the EFA model. The value of Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy (0.696) and Bar  
tlett's Sphericity Test $( X ^ { 2 } = 6 9 0 1 . 6 6$ $\mathrm { d f } = 7 0 3$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } .$ showed that the data were the "middling fit' for factor analysis   
(Tabachnick & Fidell, 2014, p.68). The principal decision on the number of factors was made ased on the scre plot and eigenvalues

(see Fig. 1). Four-, five-, and six-factor models were compared with the Promax Rotation $( K a p p a = 4 )$ , and the five-factor model was considered optimum because the largest number of loaded variables $_ { ( > 0 . 3 ) }$ and the fewest cross-loadings of features $( < 2 )$ were found. The elimination of features within the fixed five-factor model was sucesively performed on variables that were low in frequency - $_ { \cdot < 1 0 0 }$ occurrences in the whole corpus), small in communality $( < 0 . 2 5 )$ , and failure of loading onto dimensions $( < | 0 . 3 | )$ . The final set of features retained for the present analysis was 38 (eigenvalue ${ > } 2$ ) for five functional dimensions, and accounted for 35.82 percent of the cumulative shared variance. This indicates approximately one-third of the data can be explained, exceding the average accountability of previous MDA studies (Egbert & Staples, 2019).

Based on the EFA model, dimension scores on five functional dimensions were calculated in three steps. First raw frequencies of the 38 retained linguistic features were converted to Z-scores by the standard procedure of "Compute' in SPss 26.0. Second, Z-scores of linguistic fatures loaded on specific dimensions were added to generate dimension scores for each text in the 3R corpus. In the case of double loadings of linguistc features on different dimensions, only the biggest loadings were counted in the calculation of dimension scores of the five-solution factorial model. However, any linguistic feature with a second loading larger than $\pm 0 . 3$ was recorded by square brackets to asst the functional characterization of dimensions. Third, average dimension scores for the genre of 3R and each sub-corpus were calculated by the division of the sum of dimension scores of al texts by the number of texts in the sub-corpora.

For the second and third objectives, comparisons among disciplines and periods were made explicit by running normality, linearity, and homoscedasticity of dimension scores before the implementation of ANOVAs. However, the results of the data did not asume the underlying hypotheses of ANOVA and MANOVA. Therefore, non-parametrical statistical tests, i.e. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Walli H one-way ANOVAs, were conducted to dimension scores as dependent variables, and disciplines/periods as independent variables. Values f ignificance in subsequent pairwise comparisons were adjusted with the Bonferroni orction at the level of 0.05. Effect sizes were measured by Cohen's $d$ - $d = 0 . 2$ , 0.5, and 0.8 as cutoff values for small, moderate, and large effects) in Mann-Whitney U Tests, and by eta squared $( \eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 4$ , 0.24, and 0.64 as cutoff values for small, medium, and large effects) in Kruskal-Wallis H Tests (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2014).

# 4. The EFA model and interpretation of functional dimensions

Before the discussions on the disciplinary and diachronic variations in the 3R genre, consensus should be built upon the common ground facilitating registerial comparisons. Therefore, the EFA model of the 3R genre, together with it functional interpretations, is presented below.

Table 3 shows the EFA result of 38 inguistic features retained on five dimensions (see Appendix A for a summary of the linguistic features in the full factorial structure matrix). The five dimensions were interpreted based on the practical characterizations of writing conventions in different discplinary communitie (text samples), statisical results of opposing poles of dimensios (dimension scores), and theoretical implications from previous MDA studies (Biber, 198, 2006; Egbert, 2015; Friginal & Hardy, 2019; Omidian et l., 2021).

38 Co-occurring linguisti features on each dimension reflect shared conventional functions of a social community where authors defend themselves against comments and criticisms by the careful composition of the evaluation and argumentation in 3R articles. Some inguistic features that are multifunctional (e., common nouns, adverbs) are discussed under one function in accordance with the aliency of dimensions. Th urrent five-factor model was laelleda follows . Litrats. ral production,i. Nn-technical stance vs. specialized informational densit, i. Etho-riented non-narrativ vs. loos-oriented narrtive concerns, iv. Elaborated persuasion, and v. Overt expression of evaluation.

In what follows, we wil investigate each dimension individuall to determine how the composition of 3R articles acrossfive di mensions varied acrosdisciplines and time. The interpretation of dimensions commences by examining the complementary poles of each dimension. In Excerpts 1 to 5, lexico-grammatical features with positive loadings were italicized, whereas those with negative loadings were underlined.

# 4.1. Dimension 1: Literate vs. oral production

The existence of oral/literate dimensions prevails across wrte or spoken registers in MDA studies. In Biber's (2006) investigation of university language and Gray's (2015) linguistic characterization of research articles, the oralliterate continum in academic discourse i featured by the communicative purposes (involved vs. informational) and production circumstances of the given genre (real-time vs. edited). Despite its evaluative natre, the genre of 3R is, rembling jounal articles informational & edited) asmed to represent the dichotomy of orality and literacy with a similar agglomeration of lexico-grammatical devices.

In the first dimension, common vocabularies 501 to 3000, academic vocabularies 3000 average word length,atributive adjectives, nominalizations, and cognitive nouns are positively loaded, while past tense verbs are negatively loaded. The functionalassociation of the six positive features $_ { ( > 0 . 5 ) }$ is interpreted to present the scholarly and literate tone of repliers in 3R articles. For instance, both the common and academic vocabulary lis (choice, the, without indicate a high degre of abstraction and dense informational package (Egbert, 2015). Abstract nouns (equlibrium, symbol), nominalizations (measurement, presentation formulation) and average word length are heavily employed to represent the academese of texts (McGrath & Liardet, 2023). Cognitive nouns pertain to cognitive entities (notion, perspectie, judgment), typically referring to astract concepts associated with human agents (Gray, 2015, p. 91). On top of these features, the atributive adjective (observable, subsequent, nonclearing),serving as their modifier, also facilitates the informativenes and abstraction f 3R articles. In Excerpts 1.1 and 1.2, the functional assciation of atributie adjectives and nouns reflects the careful presentation of the elaboration and self-justification in 3R articles.

On the negative pole of Dimension 1, past tense verbs (said, were, found) are seen to appear with simple syntactic structures (declaratives and interrogatives) in Excerpts 1.3 and 1.4, thereby suggesting the colloquial styl of academic production. The complementary distribution of lexico-grammatical indicators on Dimension 1 strengthens the literate vs. oral distinction, with features explicating udgements from authors of 3R articles at the positive end, and exemplifications for the argumentation at the negative end.

# 4.2. Dimension 2: Non-technical stance vs. specialized informational density

In contrast to the literate and oral split identified by Dimension 1, Dimension 2 cuts directly across the literacy continuum. Considering both the positive and negative distribution of the co-occurring linguistic features, Dimension 2 is interpreted as "Nontechnical stance vs. specialized informational density".

The interpretation of Dimension 2 is based on the scrutiny of the four negatively-loaded lexico-grammatical features in nominal structures, including pre-modifying nouns, technical nouns (equation, compound), common nouns (way, point), and in nominal related structures that-deletion participial rlative clauses (the comments made by Dr X). In Excerpts 2.3 and 2.4, texts with nominal features share two functional characteristics: density of information package and specialization of information (Biber & Gray, 2010; Gardner et al., 2019). Common nouns, which comprise multiple semantic types of nouns excluding nominalizations and gerunds, demonstrate the heavy information package on the negative side of the first functional atribute. Other semantic subsets of common nouns, including abstract (information), cognitive (concern), concrete (note), human $( D r )$ , institution (college), place (country), quantity (ratio), and technical (biosensor) nouns, are the primary bearer of meaning in academic texts (Biber & Gray, 2016). Technical nouns reflect the second functional atribute of specialized and technical information, accompanied by excessive use of nominal pre-modifiers (iron deficiency) enhancing the informational density of 3R articles.

The positive end of Dimension 2 contains lexico-grammatical features signalling a non-technical stance towards the target recipients of 3R articles. The first functional combination is consistent with Egbert's (2015) description of non-technical clusters in academic writing, comprising the first 500 words of common vocabulary, general adverbs, and emphatics. Features of human nouns, third-person pronouns, and mental verbs (favor) indicate the recipients of the non-technical information. The remaining inguistic features reflect an implicit stance towards these recipients. For instance, in Excerpts 2.1 and 2.2,stance-loaded adverbs indvertently), to clauses controlled by stance nouns (falure to), infinitives (to aid) and emphatics just) imply authors' inclination to defend them selves under the disguise of commonalities. The two functional elements indicate a non-technical form of atitude expressed towards target recipients of 3R articles: critics who presented negative evaluations or even criticism towards previous research.

# 4.3. Dimension 3: Ethos-oriented non-narrative vs. logos-oriented narrative concerns

Dimension 3is charactrized by the stereotypical distinction between non-narratie and narrative concerns as evidenced in several MDA studies (Biber, 1988; Egbert, 2015; Gray, 2015; Omidian et al., 2021). The contrast between present and past tense verbs indicates that the discourse ether deals with more immediate matters and hapenings, or report and describes past events (Biber, 198, p. 109). The negative cluster of past tense verbs and common nouns showcases an active, event-oriented discourse where the sequential description of the state of past events is involved with specific nominal referents. In Excerpts 3.3 and 3.4, the results of experiments and well-known historical incidents are presented as generally-accepted facts, knowledge, or norms of the respective disciplinary community. The positive cluster of present tense verbs, copula be, predicative adjectives and pronouns it, realizes "relational clauses", serving to clarify or identif the status or being of events and participants (Halliday & Mathiesen, 2014, pp. 259-300) and highlighting definitions and explanations of terms and concepts in academic writing (Egbert, 2015). In Excerpts 3.1. and 3.2, the robin is identified as being a prototypical type of bird, and the pronoun it is endowed with the state of possessing large consequences.

The co-occurrence of residual poitive lexico-grammatical elements on Dimension 3 indicates the second attribute of Dimension 3 - stance in the 3R genre. Stance adverbials and general adverbs showcase a varying degree of evaluation towards (un)certainty, likelihood, and factualit about reviewers' proposition, knowledge and authority (Biber, 2006, p. 8). Repliers' use of conditional subordinator $i f$ and negations emphasizes concession as a "mitigating device' in academic criticism (Zou & Hyland, 2020), and re. viewers' questionable criticisms (Warchal, 2010). In Excerpt 3.1, the assertion of the critic (you) is challenged by assuming the righteousness of the claim $( i f )$ and then drawing an untenable corollary (a prototype isn't a mental representation) for academics to refute.

In relation to the stuational parameters of 3R articles the non-narrative pole focuses on authors' appeals to "widely-known and generally ccepted methods and theory, whereas the narrative pole emphasizes "substantial eidence and sound reasoning" to refute critics (Afros, 2014, p. 81; Livnat, 2014). Therefore, Dimension 3 was labelled \*Ethos-oriented non-narrative vs. logos-oriented narrative concerns".

# 4.4. Dimension 4: Elaborated persuasion

Dimension 4 highlights a relatively different fcet of linguistic variation-the absence of negative lexico-grammatical features. The positive-loading features are combined for the sole functional characteristic of elaboration and persuasion. These features include three types of verbs and three types of that-verb complement clauses.

Biber (2006) classifies verbs in terms of semantic domains into activity verbs (leave) denoting actions and events, aspectual verbs (finish) denoting the sage of progres, causation verbs (enable, require) denoting evoking of ents, communication vers (announce) denoting interactions, mental verbs (need) denoting mental states,ocurrence vers (become) denoting natural happenings, public verbs (admit, rely) denoting fact as sech acts, private verbs (think, consider, belie) denoting facts as discoveries, rlationship vers (contain) denoting exstence between entities, and suasive verbs (agree denoting mandative suggestions. In the present positie pole of Dimension 4, that verb complement clauses receive the iggest loading of al the 38 featres retained (0.975) and indexed as the major feature on the Dimension of On-line informational elaboration" (Biber, 1988). The function of elaboration is also obtained from lexico-grammatical features such as that clauses contolled by speech act vers and factual vers. Both types of that clauses are heavily reliant on the agents of events.

For instance, in Excerpts 4.1 and 4.2 that clauses controlled by speech act verbs (assure, reply) and that clauses controlled by factual verbs (show) suggest the action and event are practised by intentional human agents to convey an elaborated and condensed information package with a varying degree f argumentative engagement (Afros, 2014, 2022). Additional features such as public, private and suasive verbs are the primary bearer of volition to persuade readers of the trustworthiness of the research being challenged (Hunston, 2005). These features are labelled as "Overt expression of persuasion/argumentation' in Biber's (1988, 2006) research into universt language and spoken and written English. Therefore, the combination of elaboration and persuasion resulted inthe present dimension of \*Elaborated persuasion".

# 4.5. Dimension 5: Overt expression of evaluation

The fifth and final dimension is characterized at its positive pole by evaluative adjectives, to clauses controlled by evaluative adjectives and infintives. Considering the situational characteristic of 3R articles, the lexico-grammatical features in Dimension 5 are found to be deeply associated with authors' attitudes and evaluations toward criticism and challenges.

The factor loadings of evaluative adjectives and to clauses controlled by evaluative adjectives are rated as the second and third biggest loadings among 38 features, highlighting a dense emotional condensation of texts. The evaluative adjective, as one of two semantic goupings of adjectives, denotes gradable emotive concepts such as happy, sad, good or bad. This s evident in the occurrence of the adjectives original, btter and adaptiv in Excerpts 5.1 and 5.2. Similarly to clauses controlled by evaluative adjectives are the main indicator of stance in both spoken and written modes of language, as exemplified in phrases such as necessary to, esentil to, and appropriate to.

The dimension of stance has been discovered in academic texts (Biber, 2006; Gardner et al., 2019;, Gray, 2015), which coheres with the view that stance is a key feature of academic texts (Hunston, 2010; Hyland & Guinda, 2012). The co-occurrence of evaluative adjectives and to clausal counterparts further corroborates the ubiquity of stance and evaluation in academic writing. Thus, Dimension 5 in the present study is marked as "Overt expression of evaluation".

# 5. Disciplinary variations across dimensions

Results in the preceding section have llustrated the five functional dimensions in the descriptions of the genre of 3R articles. The next step is to investigate how these dimensions are represented in dierent disciplines, and to what extent disciplines change in the EFA model of 3R articles (RQ2).

Table 4 shows descriptive statistics for the dimension scores of eight WoS categories, and the inferential results of Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Walli H Tests, as well as Cohen's d. The comparison of dimension scores in soft and hard disciplines reveals that dis ciplines are significant on allfive functional dimensions with varying degrees of effect sizes.

Discipline, as an appropriate predictor in facilitating functional description and explanation of linguistic features in academic discourse (Hyland, 2004), differentiates the genre of 3R in soft disciplines as literal (Mean $= 2 . 0 4$ $\mathrm { S D } = 7 . 3 7 $ , non-technical attitudinal $( \mathrm { M e a n } = 2 . 7 1 $ $\mathrm { S D } = 2 . 4 6 ) $ , Ethos-oriented non-narrative $( \mathrm { M e a n } = 1 . 8 6$ $\mathrm { S D } = 7 . 4 1 $ ), elaborately persuasive $\mathbf { M e a n } = 1 . 7 7$ $\mathrm { S D } = 6 . 7 9 $ and overtly evaluative $( \mathrm { M e a n } = 0 . 5 4$ $\mathrm { S D } = 2 . 3 8 )$ , and that of hard disciplines as oral $( \mathrm { M e a n } = - 2 . 0 4 $ $S \mathrm { D } = 4 . 3 2 ) $ , specialized informationally-dense $( \mathrm { M e a n } = - 2 . 7 1 $ $\mathbf { S D } = 3 . 1 1 \mathbf { \bar { \Gamma } }$ , logos-oriented narrative $( \mathrm { M e a n } = - 1 . 8 6 $ $\mathrm { S D } = 2 . 5 6 \AA$ , persuasive $( \mathrm { M e a n } = - 1 . 7 7 ;$ $\mathbf { S D } = 3 . 0 3$ ), and evaluative ( $\mathtt { M e a n } = - 0 . 5 4$ $\mathbf { S D } = 0 . 9 9$

# 5.1. Variation on Dimension 1

Table 4 demonstrates that there is a significant difference between soft and hard disciplines with a moderate effect size $\left( \mathbf { U } \right) =$ 16,651, $d = 0 . 7 8 4$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } \big )$ on Dimension 1. This suggests that discipline is correlated with the mode of academic production in the construction of aliterate or ora tle of communication. That is authors of 3R articles from soft disciplines prefer the litratestle in comparison to their counterparts from hard disciplines.

However, when the eight WoS categories are mapped onto Dimension 1, an ambiguity that does not match disciplinary preferences occurred inthe opposing poles as shown in Fig. 2 (see Appendix for results of Kruskal-Walli H Tess). This i ilustrated by Psychology $( \mathrm { M e a n } = 0 . 5 9$ 3 $\displaystyle \mathbf { S D } = 6 . 3 4 \mathrm { \Sigma }$ , a sub-register in the hard disciplines which does not reside on the negative pole as do its peers. A similar divergence of disciplinary preference is also found in Economics (I $\mathrm { I e a n } = - 0 . 8 2$ $\mathrm { S D } = 4 . 4 5 $ , while the general tendency of soft disciplines suggests the more literate type of academic production at the positive end of Dimension 1.

Pairwise comparisons of the eight WoS categories were undertaken to examine the academic production of Dimension 1 across disciplines. Inter-disciplinarily, the greatest discrepancy is found in Linguistics $( \mathrm { M e a n } = 7 . 1 6$ $\mathbf { S D } = 9 . 0 6 $ and all sub-registers of hard disciplines, including Physics ( $\mathrm { M e a n } = - 3 . 6 3$ $\mathrm { { S D } } = 1 . 9 6$ $\mathrm { H } = 2 2 6 . 5 5 0$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 4 6 5 , p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } )$ Chemistry $( \mathrm { M e a n } = - 3 . 3 7 ,$ $\mathbf { S D = }$ 2.61, $\mathrm { H } = 2 1 7 . 8 5 0$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 4 4 7$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } .$ , Biology $( \mathrm { M e a n } = - 3 . 6 3$ $\mathrm { { S D } } = 1 . 9 6$ $\mathrm { H } = 1 5 6 . 6 1 7$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 3 1 7$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { * * } )$ , and Psychology $( \mathrm { M e a n } = 0 . 5 9$ $\mathrm { S D } = 6 . 3 4 $ $\mathrm { H } = 8 9 . 4 0 0$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 7 5$ 3 $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } \mathrm { ~ . ~ }$ . Intra-disciplinarily, soft and hard disciplines have minimal in-group variations in the style of academic production. Physics vs. Psychology $( \mathrm { H } = 1 3 7 . 1 5 0 $ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 2 7 6 , p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } )$ , and Economics vs. Linguistics $( \mathrm { H } = 1 2 3 . 2 8 3$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 2 4 6 , p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } )$ are the greatest intra-disciplinary contrasts in the current EFA model. The inter- and intra-disciplinary variances on Dimension 1 demonstrate considerable changes in the academic tone that each discipline uses to construct disciplinary knowledge according to the academic convention.

# 5.2. Variation on Dimension 2

The results of the Mann-Whitney $U$ Test and the corresponding effect sizes report Dimension 2 as the most significant, and at the same time, the strongest predicator of register variation in 3R articles $\mathbf { \Delta U } = 1 0 , 9 4 3$ $d = 1 . 2 7 1$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } .$ . Fig. 3 visualizes the register variation across the soft and hard disciplinary continuum.

A fundamental diference i detected in the comparison between mean score of soft and hard disciplines, especially in Physics and Other soft WoS categories. For example, Physics $( \mathrm { M e a n } = - 4 . 4 4$ $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 2 5 ) $ , Chemistry $( \mathrm { M e a n } = - 3 . 8 9 $ $\mathbf { S D } = 1 . 0 5$ ) and Biology (Mean $= - 2 . 7 5$ $\mathbf { S D } = 2 . 2 2 $ , located on the negative end of Dimension 2, have heavy specialized information flow, while Linguistics $( { \mathrm { M e a n } } =$ 6.47, $\mathrm { S D } = 1 0 . 2 7 )$ and History $( \mathrm { M e a n } = 3 . 5 2$ $\mathrm { S D } = 9 . 5$ , have a non-technical stance towards reviewers. Subsequent Kruskal-Wallis H Tests amongst sub-registers of 3R articles corroborate the results in Fig. 3 that Physics and Linguistics $( \mathrm { H } = 2 7 4 . 5 1 7$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 5 6 7 , p <$ $0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } )$ have the greatest discrepancy. In their respective disciplinary registers, pairwise comparisons signpost Economics $( { \mathrm { M e a n } } =$ $- 1 . 5 6$ $\mathrm { S D } = 2 . 7 4 \AA$ in soft disciplines and Psychology (Mean $= 0 . 2 3$ $\mathrm { S D } = 4 . 2 7 \mathrm { \Omega }$ in hard disciplines as the most distinct in comparison to their intra-disciplinary peers, notwithstanding that greater discrepancies are detected in hard disciplinary variations (Psychology vs. Physics: $\mathrm { H } = 1 9 8 . 7 1 7$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 4 0 6$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { * * } \big )$ than in soft science (Economics vs. Linguistics: $\mathrm { H } = 1 1 8 . 3 5 0$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 2 3 6 , p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } )$ on Dimension 2. These further corroborate preceding observations that intra-disciplinary variation is greater in hard than soft disciplines.

Apart from the contrasts, it is noted that Psychology and Economics seem to alienate themselves to the \*wrong end" of the disciplinary continuum, violating their disciplinary standards of information density and stance-taking. A close inspection of corpora in both sub-registers and preceding discussions on intra-disciplinary variations suggests unanticipated functional clusters of linguistic features on Dimension 2 were gglomerated as a pure authorial endeavour to maintain authors individualit as wellas to co-construct disciplinary convention in the global paradigm.

# 5.3. Variation on Dimension 3

Fig. 4 illustrates the second strongest disciplinary variation among the five dimensions -the functional dimension Ethos-oriented non-narrtive vs. logos-oriented narratie concerns", which is the second strongest disciplinary variation among the five dimensions. The effect size of Dimension 3 $\mathbf { \Delta } [ \mathrm { U } = 1 3 , 3 8 9$ A $d = 1 . 0 4 5$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } .$ ) indicates that soft disciplines employ the ethos-oriented colloquial style, whereas disputants from hard disciplines adopt the logos-oriented argumentative style in the 3R corpus.

At the positive end of the spectrum, higher loadings reside in Linguistics $( \mathrm { M e a n } = 5 . 8 3$ $\mathrm { S D } = 1 0 . 6 2 $ and History $( \mathrm { M e a n } = 1 . 6 7 $ SD $= 7 . 6 3 )$ , and this can be corrlated with the colloquial style of arguments making an emotional appeal to onlookers. On the opposing end of the spectrum, however, higher negative loadings correspond to Physics $( \mathrm { M e a n } = - 2 . 6 4 $ $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 0 8 $ ) and Chemistry $( { \mathrm { M e a n } } =$ $^ { - 2 . 5 }$ $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 5 2 ) $ , which present facts and sequential events in a narrative manner as the argumentative strategy.

Based on the initial observation and speculations from Fig. 4,stark diffrences are calculated in Kruskal-Wallis H Tests between opposing ends, especially in pairs such as Linguistics vs. Physics $( \mathrm { H } = 2 3 2 . 2 6 7 , \eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 4 7 7 , p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } )$ Chemistry $( \mathrm { H } = 2 2 6 . 6 5 0 ,$ $\eta ^ { 2 } =$ 0.465, $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } )$ , or Biology $( \mathrm { H } = 1 9 5 . 7 1 7 $ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 4$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } )$ , as well as History vs. Physics $\mathrm { ( H } = 1 7 1 . 1 1 7$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 3 4 8$ $p <$ $0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } \}$ and Chemistry $( \mathrm { H } = 1 6 5 . 5 0 0$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 3 3 6$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } )$ . Notably, there are also significant disparities between the negative pole and the positive pole, i.e. Physics vs. Psychology $( \mathrm { H } = 1 3 0 . 1 1 7$ 3 $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 2 6 1$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { * * } )$ , and Economics vs. Linguistics $\left( \mathrm { H } = \right.$ 102.200, $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 2 0 2$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } \big )$ . Nevertheless, the effect sizes of distinction are moderately small as compared to cross-disciplinary variations on Dimension 3.

Complementary disciplinary patterns in expressions of argumentation are pre-anticipated in the global scale of disciplinary vari. ation and can be explained by the fact that rgisters in the soft disciplines are idea-oriented and atitdinal, whereas registers in the hard disciplines are fact-oriented and impersonal (Gray, 2015; Hunston, 2010; Hyland & Guinda, 2012).

Fig. 4. Dimension 3 mean scores across WoS categories.

# 5.4. Variation on Dimension 4

Disciplinary variations on Dimension 4 are significant and the third largest as suggested by the statistical output $( \mathrm { U } = 1 5 , 5 5 1$ $d =$ 0.868, $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } )$ in the pairwise comparisons. Fig. 5 demonstrates how the functional construct of persuasion differentiates across disciplines in compelling target recipients to accept authors' point of view.

It is noteworth that Dimension 4 possses the largest number of significant dichotomies between soft and hard disciplines. This is evidenced by the total number of 19 ignificant pairs of variation detected on the complementary spectrum of \*Elaborated persuasion". As with representations on other functional dimensions of the current EFA model, Linguistics $( \mathrm { M e a n } = 5 . 8 4 , \mathrm { S D } = 8 . 7 1 )$ 1, residing on the positive end of the continum, osesses the highest mean score and is istinct from allsub-registers. For instance, the polarization of Linguistics and Chemistry $( \mathrm { H } = 2 2 9 . 1 5 0$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 4 7 1$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } )$ indicates the greatest discrepancies, followed by Physics $\left( \mathrm { H } = \right.$ 215.383, $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 4 4 1$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } .$ and Biology $( \mathrm { H } = 1 9 9 . 1 8 3$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 4 0 7$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } )$ . Other within-group differences are found in Linguistics vs. Economics $( \mathrm { H } = 1 1 4 . 3 5 0$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 2 2 7$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } \big )$ , vs. Politics $( \mathrm { H } = 9 2 . 9 0 0$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 8 2$ $p < 0 . 0 5 ^ { * } )$ , and vs. History (H $= - 8 4 . 8 0 0$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 9 4$ $p < 0 . 0 5 ^ { * } .$

Furthermore, Chemistry displays the second-largest contrast $( \mathrm { M e a n } = - 2 . 6 2 , \mathrm { S D } = 2 . 0 3 )$ , located at the negative endpoint of the "Elaborated persuasion' continuum. Comparisons of mean scores suggest that Chemistry differs from Politics $\mathrm { ( H = - } 1 3 6 . 2 5 0$ $\eta ^ { 2 } =$ 0.303, $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } \big )$ , History $( \mathrm { H } = 1 4 4 . 3 5 0$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 2 9 1$ 3 $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } )$ , Psychology $( \mathrm { H } = 1 3 9 . 1 8 3$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 2 8 0$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } )$ , and Economics $( \mathrm { H } = - 1 1 4 . 8 0 0$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 2 5 8$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } \big )$ at varying yet similar degrees of variance. The remaining 19 significant pairs stretch along the opposing poles of the persuasion continum, indicating a specific representation of argumentative strategies.

# 5.5. Variation on Dimension 5

The variation of disciplines on Dimension 5 is showcased in Fig. 6. The Mann-Whitney $U$ Test illustrates that disciplinary dichotomy on Dimension 5 ( $\mathbf { U } = 1 9 9 4 7 . 5$ $d = 0 . 5 5 2$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } )$ does exist, but is minimal in comparison with previous dimensions. This might be explained by a closer inspection of its range of variance on the complementary spectrum, which appears to be the smallest and within the limited range of $\pm 1 . 5$ The absence of negative linguistic features on Dimension 5 further indicates a similar pattern of overt evaluations shared by both disciplines: excessive use of evaluative adjectives and to clauses controlled by adjectives.

Follow-up Kruskal-Wallis H Tests show that Physics ( $\mathsf { M e a n } = - 0 . 8 7$ $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 6 1$ ) on Dimension 5 is hugely different to the other subregisters in the 3R corpus (Linguistics: $\mathrm { H } = 1 5 4 . 5 9 2$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 3 1 3$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast }$ , History: $\mathrm { H } = 1 1 6 . 9 5 0$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 2 3 3$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast }$ , and Psychology: $\mathrm { H } = 9 0 . 7 4 2$ $\eta ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 7 7$ $p < 0 . 0 5 ^ { * } )$ . Other significant inter-disciplinary variations on Dimension 5 appear primarily in groups of Chemistry () $\mathsf { M e a n } = - 0 . 5 3$ 3 $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 1 3 \mathrm { \Omega }$ and Biology $( \mathrm { M e a n } = - 0 . 5 6$ $\displaystyle \mathbf { S D } = 0 . 9 9 _ { . }$ ) in comparison to Linguistics $( \mathrm { M e a n } = 1 . 3 2$ $\mathrm { S D } = 3 . 0 0 $ ) and History $( \mathrm { M e a n } = 0 . 5 3 , \mathrm { S D } = 2 . 3 8 )$ . One deviation from the disciplinary convention of "Overt expression of evaluation" is Economics, yet this deviation is far from significant.

These observations make Physics and Economics special sub-registers cross-disciplinarily. The dimensional speciality of Physics shows that the evaluation produced by authors from hard disciplines is more discret and covert, and primarily concealed beneath elaborated argumentation based on formulas, equations and diagrams. Conversely, authors from soft disciplines take a cautious but explicit tance in 3R writings by employing significantly more linguistic fatures than those from hard disciplines, such as evaluative adjectives ( $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { U } = 1 9 6 3 7 . 5$ $d = 0 . 5 7 3$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } .$ ) and to clauses controlled by evaluative adjectives $\mathrm { U } = 2 2 0 5 5 . 5$ 3 $d = 0 . 4 1 4$ $p <$ $0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast }$ . Therefore, the functional distributions of contrastive paradigms of science in the expression of evaluations and attitudes can be assumed as general cross-disciplinary variation, where linguistic pattrns are characterized by their respective situational parameters in academic interactions.

# 6. Diachronic variations across dimensions

Having discussed the efect of disciplines on dimension scores, we now turn to explore whether the functional dimensions of 3R articles have varied over time, and how the functional dimensions have developed across disciplines and time (RQ 3). The variations across time andiscilins were istrated by line chart, and he dfern eweenvariable oftime (1980vs. 2020) anddiscilines (Soft vs. Hard) were computed using Mann-Whitney U Tests. The scores of U, effect size and $p$ -value can be found in. Appendices C, D and E.

# 6.1. Diachronic profiling of dimensions

Fig. 7 visualizes the evolution of five functional dimensions over 40 years in the genre of 3R articles. The overal trend appears to highlight the evolution of the genre from oral, non-technical, ethos-oriented non-narrative persuasion to literat, technically-dense, logos-oriented narrative persuasion.

The mean score of Dimension 1 dramatically surged from 1980 to 2020 with a medium effect size $\mathrm { ~ U ~ } = 2 8 6 7$ $d = 0 . 6 9 1$ $p <$ $0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } \}$ , indicating a complete transition of the 3R genre from an oral to a literate style of academic writing. This observation corroborates Biber and Gray's (2016, p. 34) claim that academic prose is up-tight written registers reisting \*historicl change towards the increased use of colloquial features", yet contradicts Hyland and Jiang's (2017) finding where a minor increase of colloquial features are discovered in the genre of research articles from 1965 to 2015.

Dimensions 2, 3 and 4 experienced asimilar patten of change: signficant increases in the first twenty years of development, abrupt decreases in 2010, and then substantial increases in the year 2020. However, subsequent results of Mann-Whitney U Tests in Appendix C suggested that Dimension 4 was statistically significant in terms of diachronic changes with a modest efect size $\mathbf { \left( U = 3 7 9 7 \right. }$ $d = 0 . 3 0 8$ $\pmb { p } < < 0 . 0 5 ^ { * } )$ , while Dimensions 2 and 3 appeared relatively stable $\mathrm { U } = 3 9 3 5 . 5$ $d = 0 . 2 5 4$ A $p > 0 . 0 5$ $\mathrm { U } = 4 4 2 8$ $d = 0 . 0 6 8 , p$ $> 0 . 0 5 )$ over the 40 years. These discrepancies among the three dimensions may result from an abrupt shift of academic writing conventions from the leter-writing styl to the argumentative style, where the informational and narratie aspects of the 3R genre have remained intact.

As indicated by the smooth line in Fig. 7, Dimension 5 was resistant to change over 40 years $\mathbf { \Delta U } = 4 2 3 1$ 3 $d = 0 . 1 4 2$ $p > 0 . 0 5$ Despite minor fluctations in 1990, the overt expression of evaluation in 3R articles has remained primal for the past four decades. This finding supported the claims made by Hunston (2005) and Afros (2014, p. 79) that the communicative purpose of 3R articles is to underscore authors' negative evaluation towards critics who \*flout the community expectations".

The diachronic profiling of dimensions of the 3R genre has provided substantial evidence of the evolution of academic writing from colloquial to informational, and from elaborated to compressed style, while other dimensions have remained relatively unchanged.

# 6.2. Diachronic and disciplinary variations of dimensions

To further explicate the genre variation of 3R articles and answer RQ 3, comparisons were made across time and disciplines e.g. the variation in the soft/hard disciplines in 1980 and 2020. Mann-Whitney U Tests reveal that there is one significant dimension (Dimension 1) in the soft disciplines, and two (Dimensions 1 and 4) in the hard disciplines (see Appendices D and Efor more information on significance values and effect sizes).

For Dimension 1, the mean scores for the soft disciplines $\mathrm { T } = 7 3 6$ $d = 0 . 6 5 5$ $p < 0 . 0 5 ^ { * } )$ I, hard disciplines $\mathrm { T } = 6 7 7$ $d = 0 . 7 6 0 , p <$ $0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast }$ and entire corpus $\scriptstyle [ \mathbf { U } = 2 8 6 7$ $d = 0 . 6 9 1$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ^ { \ast \ast } .$ ) increase substantially with medium effect sizes over a period of 40 years (see ig. 8). Despite a general upward trend in the evolution of a literate tyle of the 3R genre, the dimension score in 2010 reveals an abrupt decrease in mean scores acrossall dsciplinary groups. These reductions may be atributable t the decrease of tokens in 2010 in the composition of 3R articles, assuming the confounding fect between text length and other linguistic features demonstrated by

Fig. 7. Diachronic variation of five dimensions.

numerous MDA studies (Liimatta, 2023).

Fig. 9 showcases the diachronic evolution of Dimension 4 with respect to the disciplinary variable. In the dimension of Elaborated persuasion, hard disciplines (i.e. Chemistry) demonstrate a moderate difference $\mathrm { ~ U } = 8 4 5 . 5$ $d = 0 . 4 7 1$ $p < 0 . 0 5 ^ { * } .$ between 1980 and 2020. Soft disciplines (i.e. Linguistics), on the other hand, only show a modest increase over the years $\mathbf { \Delta } \cdot \mathbf { U } = 1 0 4 6$ $d = 0 . 1 5 9$ $p > p <$ $0 . 0 5 ^ { * } $

Considering the entire corpus of 3R, a pairwise comparison between 1980 and 2020 on Dimension 4 suggests a small but steady increase during the recorded 40 years. The surge in the mean dimension score of Elaborated persuasion can be interpreted as an indication of the increased persuasiveness and informativeness intended by authors of the 3R genre and editors,allowing for potentially more complex phrasal and clausal structures Staple et al., 2016 tosic, 2021). All these diachronic changes are evidence of the dynamic nature of stylistc choices, indicating that previously eschewed or lauded writing principles may lose their ffectiveness over time as authors seek new channels of communicating with the audience.

Apart from the disciplinary and diachronic discrepancies on the EFA model, three dimensions (Dimensions 2, 3, and 5) appeared to resist both disciplinary and temporal changes in the eight Wos categories and 40-year timeframe, signalling their status as functional constants of the 3R genre. The irst and most stable functional constant in 3R articles is assumed on many occasions as evaluative (Dimension 5), with \*overt and personal" being its chief stance (Afros, 2014, Gray, 2015; Hunston, 2005, p. 2; Khosravi & Babaii, 2017; Saidi & Karami, 2021). The general disciplinary and diachronic tendency of stance-taking in the 3R genre is that scholars from soft disciplines adopt more implicit evaluative ingustic clues in a restrained way, whereas those from hard disciplines display a more direct and candid manner towards the negative evaluation. The defence and validation of repliers' contributions and interaction with challenges, criticisms, and conflicts, are the fundamental communicative objectives shared by their respective global disciplinary communities.

The second functional constant is informativenes (Dimension 2). Resembling the informational density of other types of academic texts, the informativeness f 3R articles is represented by the complexity and richness of noun-related phrasal and clausal tructures. For instance, nominalizations, as one major set f grammatical metaphors, are re-construed from a wide array of semantic roles, such as relator, circumstance process and qualit (Halliday & Matthiessen, 2014), inclining \*to present densely packed information' by making room for phrasal and clausal qualifiers (Biber, 1988, pp. 28-29). 3R articles have inherite such traits of informational condensation from other types of academic writing and were proved to exhibit similar patterns of disciplinary and diachronic vari ation: writing in the hard discipline features more abstract and technical conceptions and theories where ideas are densely compressed into nominal groups, making meanings les explicit than those from soft iscipline (Biber & Gray, 2016; Gray, 2015; McGrath & Liardet, 2023).

The last functional constant in the 3R genre is persuasion or argumentative schemes (Dimension 3). As academic writing is ulti mately a persuasive endeavour Hyland, 2004), the persuasiveness f 3R texts is derived from authors' mastery of a range of suasive verbs, and the combination of negation with conditional subordination (Biber, 1988). Semantically, it i displayed in the choice of argumentative strategies that are also employed by other opinionated genres (Afros, 2014; Livnat, 2014; White, 2021). On the one hand, ethos is ubiquitous in 3R texts f both soft and hrd disciline, een if the expression f antagonism is diversely different. On the other, logos is more salient in hard disciplines, because \*the more linear and problem-oriented approach to knowledge construction found in the sciences allows arguments to be formulated in highly standardized ways" (Hyland, 2004), presupposing a level of theoretical knowledge and routine practices that rarely occur in soft fields.

Fig. 9. Variation of disciplines and time on Dimension 4.

To synthesize preceding discussions on the EFA model, disciplinary and diachronic variations of dimensions in the 3R corpus, we are now in a safe position to argue that the genre of 3R is technicall informative (Dimension 2), relatively non-narrative (Dimension 3), and heavily stance-laden (Dimension 5), despite minor disiplinary and temporal changes in the style of formality (Dimension 1) and persuasion (Dimension 4). These results reflect the fact that authors of 3R articles appeal to the emotions of readers, knowledge and ethics of reviewers as basic argumentative strategies to defend their expertise, validate scholarly opinions, and discredit critics arguments.

# 7. Conclusion

The present analysis has enabled us to identify and characterize clusters of lexico-grammatical features and their representations in the 3R corpus with confidence. When the five functional dimensions are combined, the genre of 3R i featured as heavily stance-laden eloquently persuasive, and relatively informative acros disciplines and time. ignificant disciplinary and diachronic variations on the five functional dimensions confirm the assumption that stance, information, and persuasion are the three pillars underlying the communicative purposes of the 3R genre.

This study has implications for academic writing, generic studies and MDA. First disciplinary and diachronic variations on five functional dimensions of the 3R genre are consistent with the widely-attested soft/hard mode of knowledge construction and evolution of scientific writings in ESP, EAP, and EP studie. Second, the present study enhances our knowledge of a les-encountered academic genre targeting specific audiences and ssues. Third, the employment of EFA sheds light on the theoretical positioning of 3R articles as an evaluative type of academic publication adjacent to the genre of book reviews in the registerial spectrum of MDA.

The novel MDA of the 3R genre provides an eficient baseline for future generic explorations of informationally-dense or stanceladen types of discourse, thereby enhancing specificity or granularity in the disciplinary profiling of knowledge domains. Future studies could further dssect 3R artices into part genres or generic moves in comparison to other genres of academic publications, or concentrate on the link between situational features and functional constants in the 3R genre. Furthermore, future research could scrutinize the multifunctionality of specific lexico-grammatical features on different dimensions, or investigate the disciplinary and diachronic variations of argumentative schemes (ethos, pathos, and logos) in the 3R genre.
