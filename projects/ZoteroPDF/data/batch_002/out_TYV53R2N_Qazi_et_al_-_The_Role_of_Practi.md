# Abstract

The focus of the current research was to determine the role of Notre Dame Institute of Education (NDIE) Practicum in enhancing student teachers’ teaching skills. A small scale panel survey was conducted to analyze 46 NDIE student teachers’ teaching skills (i.e. professional growth) throughout the year 2007-2008. Two types of questionnaires were used to gather data. The focus of the first questionnaire was to determine student teachers’ own views about their professional growth during the preparation phase. This questionnaire was administered at the end of the Classroom Teaching and Management (CTM) course. The focus of the second questionnaire was to determine student teachers’ professional growth during the first and the second rounds of school experience phase. This questionnaire was administered twice in a year: after the first round of school experience; and again after the second round of school experience. Student teachers’ views about their own teaching skills were cross checked with those of 45 cooperating teachers and five NDIE mentors. The analysis of data suggested that the NDIE Practicum played a significant role in the year 2007-2008 in enhancing student teachers’ practical classroom skills.

Keywords: Practicum, Preparation Phase, School Experience Phase, Microteaching, Mentoring, Cooperating Teachers.

# 1. Introduction a. Background

Educational institutes, particularly the educational institutes in Pakistan, are severely criticised. According to Policy and Planning Wing, Ministry of Education, Government of Pakistan (2009), “The National Educational Census (NEC) 2005 data and a number of studies indicate that professional preparation of teachers in Pakistan is neither standardized nor based on acceptable professional standards” (pp 6-7). Some critics believe that educational institutes prepare student teachers insufficiently for teaching in schools. They claim that such institutes do not provide enough opportunities for student teachers to gain sufficient pedagogical knowledge and skills so that their success as a teacher comes a long time after their graduation as a teacher; only after they have had adequate classroom experience. This belief is based on the premise that it is possible for anyone to teach (Darling-Hammond, 2000) and that teaching is best learned through trial and error on the job (Lortie, as cited in Wilson & Cameron, 1996; Placeck & Dodds, as cited in Wilson & Cameron, 1996). The critics also claim that educational institutes prepare teachers for an ideal teaching situation. The pedagogical knowledge and skills acquired by student teachers from educational institutes are usually based on those theories which have very little application within the classrooms and so very few graduates from educational institutes contribute towards the learning of students in school classrooms. Some researchers, such as Darling-Hammond (2000), consider this opinion an assumption and reject it stating that trained teachers usually perform better in classes, especially during the tasks that require higher order thinking and problem solving skills. Other researchers such as Shim, Popham, and Cornett (as cited in Jones, 1997) are of the same opinion as they found no significant differences in the classroom performance of either trained and untrained teachers.

Most teacher education institutes prepare their student teachers for teaching in the real classroom contexts through “the practicum” that is a teacher education course unit consisting of both theoretical and practical aspects. Barry and King (2002) note that, “Teaching practice [practicum] provides the opportunity to apply the principles of teaching and learning that have been studied during course work”(p. 35). Research studies suggest that student teachers view their practicum experiences as extremely important and essential for their induction into professional life (Zeichner & Gore, as cited in Keogh, Dole, & Hudson, n.d.). They believe that the practical experiences of expert teachers who observe their lessons, receiving feedback and practicing various teaching strategies during the school experience are the most important factors in student teachers’ professional growth (Tisher, as cited in Atputhasamy, 2005). For many, the practicum is the time to reflect whether or not teaching is the career for them (Barry & King, 2002). From this perspective, the practicum has the power to critically shape the student teacher’s perception of the teaching and learning (Gustason & Rowell, as cited in Grootenboer, 2006).

Although the practicum is considered important in the process of teaching and learning, a great number of criticisms are attached to it. Primary school teacher certification programme (as well as Certificate in teaching, CT and Bachelor of Education, B.Ed) neither provides the general education necessary to foster effective communication skills, critical thinking and creative instructional leadership nor promotes in-depth content knowledge (Policy and Planning Wing, Ministry of Education, Government of Pakistan, 2009). Much of the criticism connected to practicum is on the way the practicum operates. For the purpose of critique, this research focused on an analysis of the practicum of one institute.

# b. Notre Dame Institute of Education (NDIE)

This study was conducted at NDIE which is one of the renowned educational institutes of Karachi, Pakistan. NDIE prepares its B.Ed/IGCE student teachers for actual classroom situations through its Classroom Teaching and Management (CTM) and Professional Practice Units.

The CTM (the Preparation Phase of the NDIE Practicum) is a compulsory unit for all NDIE B.Ed/IGCE student teachers (STs). This unit has two objectives: first, to prepare the STs for the profession of teaching in secondary schools in Pakistan; and also to prepare student teachers for the Professional Practice Unit of NDIE (the School Experience Phase of the NDIE Practicum). During the Professional Practice Unit, STs are provided with an opportunity to teach 50 lessons in two different English Medium schools of Karachi, Pakistan, that is, 25 lessons for each of the two domain specific units chosen by STs as their method subjects. They are also required to observe 50 lessons taught by experienced teachers of the schools (cooperating teachers) where the STs are sent for teaching practice.

The rationale of this study was to analyze the extent to which the NDIE Practicum (both CTM and Professional Practice Units) was successful in preparing the STs (2007-2008 batch) for classroom teaching. In other words, the role of NDIE Practicum in enhancing STs’ teaching skills (pedagogical skills) was assessed.

It was expected that the result of this research would not only help NDIE improve its practicum but also provide guidance for other educational institutes of Pakistan to develop new or improved approaches to the practicum unit in their institutes. It was also expected that the findings of this research would motivate researchers beyond Pakistan to utilize insights from the current study while conducting research in contexts similar to the one in which the current study was conducted.

# 2. Literature Review

The review of the related literature is presented here in a conceptual framework, justifying the foundations for the current analysis.

# a. Practicum: The Highlight of Teacher Education Programme

The practicum is considered by student teachers and teacher educators as one of the most important components of teacher education programmes (Lourdusamy, Soh, Moo, Lim & Sim; Ramsey; Alexander & Galbraith; and Tisher, as cited in Atputhasamy, 2005). It can be regarded as the core and climax of a teacher education programme (Wilson, n.d.) or highlight of the teacher education programme (Barry & King, 2002). It is also considered as the cornerstone of teacher education (Cameron & Wilson, 1993).

Critics argued that teacher education must bridge the two worlds − one of theoretical knowledge, applied science, or technical rationality and the second of practical competence and epistemology of reflective practitioner (Evertson; Schon; Zeichner, as cited in Vare, 1994). The preparation phase of a practicum has a bridging role between both the theoretical and practical perspectives of the learning and the teaching world. The preparation phase performs this role by preparing student teachers for the second phase of the practicum known as the school experience phase.

Many designers of teacher education programmes stress the essential need of a collaborative relationship in which school teachers and the faculty of educational institute work together as partners to prepare student teachers for the teaching profession (Goodlad; and Levine, as cited in Vare, 1994). Some of the practicum designs go to the extent of planning each aspect of the practicum programme and having equal contribution in planning and implementing the programme by both the teachers in the school faculty and the educators from the educational institutes. Other designs allow some influence of the school teachers in making decision about the plans as well as implementation of the practicum programme.

# b. Models of a Practicum

There are various models of a practicum. Some of these models include: Apprenticeship Model (Cameron & Wilson, 1993; Keogh, Dole, & Hudson, n.d. ; Zeichner, 1992); The Cell of Experience

Model (Ball State University, 1969); Integrative Model (Whiting, Whitty, Furlong, Miles & Barton, as cited in Atputhasamy, 2005); Partnership Model (Bullough, Hobbs, Kauchak, Crow & Stokes, as cited in Atputhasamy, 2005); Community of Teachers Model (Stein, Silver, & Smith, as cited in Atputhasamy, 2005); 4K-Model (Buchberger, n.d.); and Context, Input, Product, Process (CIPP) Model (Stufflebeam et al., as cited in Tseng, n.d.).

# c. Phases of a Practicum

Although the term practicum is generally taken as school experience which is often referred to as teaching practice or student teaching (Grootenboer, 2006), there are two phases of any practicum which include: the preparation phase; and the school experience phase.

# d. Preparation Phase

How teacher preparation programmes bridge the two worlds of theoretical and practice in daily action of teaching (Evertson; Schon; Shulman; and Zeichner, as cited in Vare, 1994) is a critical question for all teacher education institutes. Their task is to follow such frameworks which enable them to develop connections between these two worlds of education.

# e. Microteaching

Microteaching is a laboratory training procedure which takes place in the preparation phase of a practicum and aims at simplifying the complexity of routine teaching-learning processes (Perlberg, as cited in Long, 1994). According to Simpson, (as cited in Long, 1994), microteaching is a form of scaled down teaching (in terms of class size, lesson length and focus of the teaching task), which was originated at Stanford University in 1963 as a means of training teachers in a range of teaching skills. Long (1994) isolates four phases that include: input (which includes providing theoretical input); practice (which allow individual student teachers to plan and teach using the skills acquired from the input session); feedback (in which mentors provide written feedback and the audience such as other student teachers and faculty members provide additional oral or written feedback); and further practice (which involves re-planning and improving and practicing the skills on the basis of feedback provided by the audience).

It is important that sufficient input is provided during the first phase of microteaching. Similarly, enough practice must be provided so that the student teachers acquire the necessary teaching skills which include Planning skills (Baer, as cited in Tan, 2001; Barry & King, 2002; Fernstermacher & Soltis, as cited in Tan, 2001; Killen, 1996 & Yadav, 1992); Instructional skills which include personal skills (Barry & King, 2002); and professional skills. Some necessary professional skills to be acquired by the teachers are communication skills (Cruickstiank; Land; Kennedy, Cruickshank, Bush and Myers as cited in Barry & King, 1995); explanation and demonstration skills (Cole & Chan, 1987); classroom management skills (Cangelosi, 1988 & McBurney-Fry, 2002); and recordkeeping skills (Cohen & Manion, 1989). Additional to these are the skills needed for teachers is Student Assessment and Evaluation Skills (Barry & King, 2002; Cole & Chan, 1987; Earl, 2003 and Popham, cited in Behar-Horenstein & Seabert, 2002).

# f. School Experience Phase

The school-based practicum experiences of the teacher education programme are viewed as the most valuable experiences by both the student teachers as well as cooperating teachers. They considered these an introduction to the context of the profession of teaching. McDullick (as cited in Hickson, Fishburne, Berg, & Saby, n.d.) argues that student teachers should spend more time in school-based experiences in order to understand the context and students well. However, spending more time in the field is not necessarily an indicator of the quality of experiences.

There are three main groups of personnel involved in the school experience programme: (1) student teachers who needs to have basic competencies before they take up practicum (Stufflebeam et al., as cited in Tseng, n.d.); (2) cooperating teachers (also called school advisors, school associate, mentor teacher, practicum supervisor and sponsor teacher) who are well versed in pedagogical knowledge and skills, are experienced and have an in-depth knowledge of school context (Gilckman & Bey, as cited in Keogh, Dole, & Hudson, n.d. and Hickson, Fishburne, Berg, & Saby, n.d.); and (3) supervisors from the educational institute who have an in-depth understanding of the practicum programme, expectation from the schools, cooperating teachers and student teachers. The supervisors are also familiar with the standards that the education institute has kept for the student teacher. He or she is also knowledgeable and understands general students and student teachers’ concerns and hence can provide guidance to student teachers (McBurney-Fry, 2002). These three personnel usually work in a triad to manage the school experience programme (there relationship is shown in Figure 1, Appendix 1).

Although the practicum provides experiences which cannot be replicated in the tertiary classroom (Grootenboer, 2006), it is viewed as an unmediated and unstructured apprenticeship which lacks course work and adequate supervision (Samaras & Gismondi, as cited in Grootenboer, 2006). Therefore, where the practicum is acknowledged for its great influence on the professional development of student teachers (Gustafson & Rowell, as cited in Grootenboer, 2006), it is criticized for its unstructured nature.

It is noted that across the board, the intent is the same, namely, for student teachers to acquire and practise the skills of a pedagogue under the supervision of a competent practitioner and in a real school. The way the practicum is organized, supervised, evaluated and integrated into the whole teacher education programme varies considerably across programmes and across institutions (Wilson, n.d.) and have different impact on student teachers’ pedagogical skills.

# g. Research Questions

The research question for the current study was:

# h. Focal Question

What role does the Notre Dame Institute of Education (NDIE) Practicum play in enhancing student teachers’ pedagogical skills?

# i. Extended Questions

There were two extended questions for the current research study.

What role does the Preparation Phase of NDIE Practicum play in enhancing student teachers’ pedagogical skills?   
What role does the School Experience Phase of NDIE Practicum play in enhancing student teachers’ pedagogical skills?

# 3. Methodology

# a. Research Design

The focus of the current study was to analyze the role of the practicum of NDIE in enhancing student teachers’ pedagogical skills. The professional growth of STs during the practicum activities in both preparation and school experience phases was highlighted. Each individual student teacher of the 2007- 2008 batch was tracked throughout the year and the longitudinal survey research design was considered to be most appropriate for the study. Fraenkel & Walslen (2006) state that in a longitudinal survey, “information is collected at different points in time in order to study changes over time” (p.

398). As the individuals were involved at different times throughout the year, this survey had the characteristics of a panel survey research (Fraenkel, & Wallen, 2006; Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2002).

# b. Population and Samples

The criterion sampling technique (Gay & Airasian, 2003) was used to select samples for the study under discussion. All those met some set of criteria or had the required characteristics were selected. The only criterion which was considered was that the student teacher should be enrolled in B.Ed/IGCE 2007-2008 batch and must take NDIE Practicum. The whole population (i.e. all 51 B.Ed/IGCE student teachers of 2007-2008 batch) fitted into this category and were asked to complete the questionnaire. As five student teachers did not complete the questionnaire after one of the school experience rounds, their questionnaires were considered incomplete and therefore rejected. This meant the total number of the sample for the study was 46 student teachers of NDIE B.Ed/IGCE 2007-2008 batch.

# c. Research Instruments

Fraenkel and Wallen (2006) hold that “the most common instruments used in survey research are the questionnaire and the interview schedule” (p. 403). Questionnaires were used to obtain the required data from the three categories of stakeholders of the NDIE Practicum (46 B.Ed/IGCE student teachers, five NDIE mentors and 46 cooperating teachers). The questionnaires used for the current study included: (1) NDIE Student Teachers (STs’) Self-assessment Form (2) STs’ CTM Unit Evaluation Form (3) Cooperating Teachers’ (CTs) Evaluation form for student teachers’ teaching and (4) Questionnaire for NDIE Mentors (NM) to evaluate student teachers’ performance.

# d. Limitations of the Study

The research presented in this report had the following limitations:

No pre-test was conducted; therefore, the student teachers’ pedagogical skills in the beginning of the research were unidentified which might have some influence on the pedagogical skills of STs.

# 4. Result of the Study

To make judgments about the role of the NDIE Practicum in enhancing STs’ pedagogical skills, data were gathered from three stakeholders including STs, CTs and NM. These data were analyzed descriptively and are presented in subsequent paragraphs.

# a. The Role of Preparation Phase of NDIE Practicum

At the end of the B.Ed/IGCE course, the STs (2007-2008 batch) were asked to rate, on a point scale, the pedagogical skills that are essential for classroom teaching and practicum sessions or activities that took place during the Preparation Phase of the NDIE Practicum.

In order to analyze the data, ratings for the two top most points on the rating scale (4 and 5 or to a large extent and completely) were combined. To determine the significance of the contribution of the NDIE Practicum sessions or activities in developing STs’ pedagogical skills, total percentages on the two highest points were categorized in three ways namely: High level of contribution (80 percent to 100 percent); Moderate level of contribution (60 percent to 79 percent) ;and No or Low level of contribution (below 60 percent).

The data from the STs indicated that the NDIE Practicum had a high level of contribution in developing five necessary teaching skills among the student teachers. These skills include: lesson planning, their ability to implement the plan, using teaching aids effectively while teaching, classroom management and self-reflection. The NDIE Practicum had a moderate level of contribution for developing an ability to construct a portfolio of learning and the development of appropriate teaching aids (Please refer to Graph 1 in Appendix 1).

The data also highlighted that a number of practicum sessions or activities during the Preparation Phase of NDIE Practicum were highly effective. These sessions or activities include: (1) Input Sessions which include regular classes (87 percent), teacher led workshops during regular teaching week (84.8 percent) and students led workshops during regular teaching week (89.1 percent); (2) Lesson Planning Sessions which include planning a lesson step-by-step (91.3 percent), planning a lesson individually (91.3 percent); and (3) Teaching Aids Development Sessions which include preparing a story box (91.3 percent) and making charts using the silhouette technique (87 percent).

Some sessions or activities during the Preparation Phase of the NDIE Practicum were moderately effective in enhancing STs’ pedagogical skills. These sessions or activities include: (1) Input Sessions which include watching a model lesson through a video (78.3 percent) and discussion led from the newspaper articles (63.1 percent); (2) Lesson Planning Sessions which include critically examining lessons prepared by other student teachers (76.1 percent), planning lessons in groups (74 percent); and (3) Teaching Aids Development Sessions which include teaching aids display (78.3 percent) and preparing a portfolio of learning (76.1 percent). None of the practicum sessions or activities that took place during the Preparation Phase and were indicated in the questionnaire was considered ineffective by the STs.

According to Barry and King (2002), “An effective teacher spends a great deal of time on careful and detailed planning” (p. 45) and STs found that their planning skills improved during the preparation phase of the NDIE Practicum. An analysis of the data indicated that a high degree of practical help was obtained from the sessions on the development of teaching aids (such as making charts using silhouette technique and preparing a story box). They believed the skill of using their teaching aids followed over into their classroom teaching. However, since they rated the teaching aids display at a moderate level, they still needed help in developing teaching aids.

As “the call to prepare teachers reflective about their practices is a dominant theme in recent teacher education literature” (Borko, Michalec, Timmons & Siddle, 1997, p. 345), the CTM course demands from the students to be reflective in their approaches towards their professional learning and practice teaching (Thomas, 2007a). Constructing portfolios have recently gained attention as a tool to promote reflection among student teachers (Borko, Michalec, Timmons & Siddle, 1997). Therefore, with all other classroom and outside classroom activities, the CTM course places emphasis on the students’ constructing an educational portfolio (Thomas, 2007a).

Portfolios enable students to acquire reflective learning which is derived from the careful consideration of prior activity with a reconstructive purpose (Retallick, n.d) that is considering the activity that has already been undertaken and trying to make it better for the future use. This can also be seen as learning from a mistake. Apart from reflection, portfolios help student teachers to remember classroom events more fully and accurately (Richert, as cited in Borko, Michalec, Timmons & Siddle, 1997). Constructing a portfolio of STs’ learning is seen as a tool to enhance STs’ reflective practices as well as their professional sustainability (Thomas, 2007a). Contrary to these positions the STs rated their learning from the portfolio process as only moderate, an indication of portfolio construction skill at a moderate level indicating the STs need for more help in constructing the portfolio.

The general pattern identified from the data analysis suggested that the preparation phase of NDIE Practicum played a significant role in enhancing student teachers’ teaching skills. Nevertheless, some aspects of the preparation phase of the Practicum were comparatively less significant and hence contributed moderately to the enhancement of the STs’ Pedagogical skills.

# b. The Role of School Experience Phase of NDIE Practicum

The STs’ data indicated that all the practicum sessions or activities during the School Experience Phase of the Practicum were highly effective. Three main categories of the practicum sessions or activities were: input sessions, mentoring sessions and working in a school environment (Please refer to Table 1, Appendix 2).

During the school experience phase of practicum, the student teachers are usually expected to plan isolated lessons on topics often selected by the supervising teachers. They need to be skilful at planning such lessons (Barry & King, 2002). To enact the belief that effective teaching is highly related to effective planning, a number of opportunities were provided to STs to plan lessons. The STs were able to gain help from NMs and CTs to planning and teaching their lessons. They participated in microteaching, taught lessons in a real classroom situation and reflected on their own planning and teaching.

In order to assess whether or not STs were able to utilize the provided learning opportunities during the School Experience Phase of the NDIE Practicum to enhance their pedagogical skills, they were tracked throughout the year. They were asked to rate their own pedagogical skills and their ratings were compared with the ratings of NMs and CTs.

The STs were asked to rate their own pedagogical skills twice in the year 2008-2009, that is at the time after the first round of school experience and again after the second round of school experience. The data indicated that STs’ planning skills, instructional skills and student assessment skills were gradually improved. This improvement is depicted Table 2 (Please refer to Table 2, Appendix 2).

Where STs improved their pedagogical skills, a slight decline was also seen in some of their instructional skills. For example after the first round of school experience $73 \%$ STs were able to support each point of the content taught with teaching aids and examples. This percentage was declined to $72 \%$ after the second round of school experience. Similarly, after the first round of school experience $71 \%$ STs made the content material easy for students to understand. This percentage was declined to $73 \%$ after the second round of school experience. A decline was also seen in STs’ skill of assessing individual student’s understanding or performance. The percentage was reduced from $78 \%$ noted after the first round of school experience to $72 \%$ noted after the second round of school experience.

Student teachers’ rating of their own teaching skills which was noted after the second round of school experience was compared with the ratings of NDIE mentors’ as well as with the ratings of cooperating teachers. It was noted that there is substantial relationship between the ratings of student teachers’ and the ratings of NDIE mentors. Both the ratings have moderate positive correlation $( \rho =$ 0.57). However, ratings of the student teachers have weak relationship with the ratings of cooperating teachers. There was low positive correlation between both the ratings $\mathrm { \Delta } ( \mathrm { p } = 0 . 3 7 )$ .

Analysis of data suggested that STs showed a moderate level of planning skill and the skills of developing appropriate teaching. A moderate percentage of STs presented well-planned lessons to the mentors or the cooperating teachers and presented well-planned lessons to the mentors or the cooperating teachers on time. It can therefore be concluded that because only a moderate percentage of students showed a high level of planning and preparation skill, STs need some help in their planning and preparation skill.

In terms of classroom performance, STs showed a moderate level of performance while teaching in the classroom during the School Experience Phase of the NDIE Practicum. A general pattern was that STs improved their classroom performance during the second round of school experience. This was because they taught 25 lessons during the first round of school experience. While teaching 25 lessons they worked under the supervision of NMs as well as CTs therefore practiced and mastered those skills. As the STs pedagogical skills were gradually improved, it can be concluded that the School Experience Phase of NDIE helped student teachers to improve their pedagogical skills.

# c. Student Teachers’ Personal Skills

CTs and NMs were asked to rate student teachers’ personal skills on a five point scale. These personal skills include: (1) Keeping adequate records of practicum activities; (2) Student teachers’ confidence;

and (3) Stable work habits among student teachers. The data indicated that both NMs and CTs have different opinions about STs’ personal skills. This difference is depicted through a graph (Please refer to Graph 2, Appendix 2).

The data analysis highlighted that NMs rated STs’ skill of showing confidence extremely high. CTs’ ratings for the same skill on the other hand, remained low. STs’ confidence was associated not only with their pedagogical skills but also with domain-specific knowledge. For example, if STs had weak Science background knowledge, they performed poorly during classroom teaching. They found difficulty in explaining the given topics well and showed an inability to handle students’ questions. Some gave wrong information while answering students’ questions which led to lack of confidence among student teachers and an inability to manage students’ behaviour (Thomas, 2007b).

Apart from the CTM course, each ST takes up two domain-specific course units as their method subjects. Even though, to provide background knowledge of the subject, the domain-specific course coordinators at NDIE revise with STs some content of the method subjects chosen by the student teachers, more concentration remains on pedagogical knowledge of the subject. Graduation [Bachelor in Science (B.SC), Bachelor of Arts (B.A) or equivalent] is the prerequisite for taking up the B.Ed/IGCE course. It is reckoned that prior to taking up B.Ed/IGCE course student teachers have acquired sufficient background knowledge of their method subject during their basic degree courses (B.Sc or B.A etc.). STs’ poor content knowledge of the subject highlighted in the current research study reflected STs poor preparation during their basic degree courses.

It was also found that all the NMs believed that student teachers kept adequate records while a moderate number of CTs were of the opinion that STs kept adequate records.

STs kept different types of records during their school experience phase of NDIE Practicum in the year 2007-2008. Some of these records include: lessons taught, lesson observed, reflection of lesson taught, reflection of lesson observed and week wise timetable.

As the NMs had access to all the records maintained by the STs, they were in a better position to make judgments about the student teachers’ record keeping skills. CTs on the other, had access to only a few records (individual observation sheets, individual lesson plans and lesson schedules), they were not in a better position to make judgments about the student teachers’ record keeping skills. On the other varying nature of supervision by the CTs also affected their overall rating for student teachers’ performance.

# d. Supervision by the Cooperating Teachers

Student teachers were asked to write comments about the supervision provided by CTs. On the basis of STs’ comments, five kinds of supervisions styles were determined and a rubric to highlight characteristics of five styles was developed.

The supervision styles demonstrated by the CTs were categorized into five categories. These categories include: genuine supervisor (a supervisor who provided an objective feedback on whatever he or she saw happening in the classrooms during teaching), unskilled or uncertain supervisor (i.e. a supervisor who showed inability to make judgments on the basis of objective observations and that supervising teachers who demonstrated inability to write comments about the lesson observed), fault seeker (a supervisor who always tried to find faults with student teachers and did not highlight student teachers’ strengths), generous supervisor (a supervisor who always rated student teachers’ performance very high) and time saver (a supervisor who considered supervision activity the time given to him or her for corrections or completing other pending work inside or outside classroom.

The data indicated that $6 0 . 9 \%$ CTs demonstrated the Genuine Supervision Style during the first round of school experience. This percentage was increased during the second round of school experience and reached to $78 . 3 \%$ . The analysis has also highlighted that except one instance (Generous Supervisor), supervision by cooperating teachers was drastically improved during the second round of school experience. However, two examples were worth noting. First of all, fault seekers were reduced from $1 5 . 2 \%$ to $4 . 3 \%$ but generous supervisors were increased from $2 . 2 \%$ to $6 . 5 \%$ .

Supervision by the CTs was gradually improved during the NDIE Practicum. This is inconsistent with the literature. Cameron & Wilson (as cited in Cameron & Wilson, 1993) report that most of the problems highlighted by the student teachers were related to CTs. STs appreciated CTs’ positive criticism and guidance for improvement. For example, a ST wrote, “…once when I was delivering lesson on letter writing Mr (name of the teacher) after appreciating gave me suggestions on how could I make lesson even more enjoyable for the students” (Munawar, 2007-2008, school experience round 2). Some STs acknowledged CTs’ suggestions before the lesson was taught. For example a ST wrote, “…before delivering our lessons they also check and give suggestion if lesson require some (sic)” (Jessica, 2007-2008, school experience round 2). The genuine supervisors not only completed the evaluation sheet but also gave feedback to the STs (Huma, 2007-2008, school experience round 2). The genuine supervisors observed complete lessons of the STs, not just parts of the lessons. For example, a ST noted. “…they sit at the back benches and observed for the whole period…” (Fakhira, 2007-2008, school experience round 1).

The STs also experienced uncertain supervision styles of the CTs. STs were of the view that some CTs did not know how to complete the observation sheet (Farah, 2007-2008, school experience round 1). Therefore, they rated student teachers’ performance either below or above the actual performance (Sultan, 2007-2008, school experience round 2).

The STs were of the opinion that some CTs appeared as fault seekers. They always tried to find faults with STs’ work. For example; a ST noted, “The supervising teachers were not encouraging me on my attempts…I was always discouraged by them” (Shan, 2007-2008, school experience round 1). The fault seekers appeared to be operating through their past experiences of the STs’ performance or their mind set about the STs. For example a ST wrote, “I was not satisfied by the supervision of my Science teacher (cooperating teacher)…Sometimes she already filled (sic) the form when I was at guided practice. She wrote already need improvement (sic)” (Monica, 2007-2008, school experience round 2).

Another style of supervision offered by the CTs was ‘the generous supervisor’ style. Some STs noted that the CTs always gave good remarks on their performance no matter whether or not the STs performed well in the classroom (Rahat, 2007-2008, school experience round 2).

Yet another style of supervision experienced by the STs was ‘the time saver’. Those CTs who exhibited this style involved themselves in completing their pending work inside or outside the classroom. STs noted that these teachers came to classes very late. For example a ST wrote, “…I missed five minutes because the teacher was coming late (sic)” (Noureen, 2007-2008, school experience round 2). CTs’ late arrival affected STs’ performance. For example a ST wrote, “…they used to come late…they used to give me only 30 or 25 minutes to teach the lesson instead of 45 minutes” (Saba, 2007-2008, school experience round 2). These CTs were not very much interested in the supervision process. For example a ST noted, that the CTs were “…just doing formality and not taking interest” (Raza, 2007-2008, school experience round1).

From the data analysis it can be inferred that even though most of the CTs provided genuine supervision style, incidences of negative supervision reduced STs’ performance.

# 5. Conclusion

The NDIE practicum played a significant role in enhancing pedagogical or teaching skills of the STs. In its preparation phase it readied the STs for the realities of school classrooms through skills developing in them as lesson planning, preparation of subject relevant teaching aids and worksheets and classroom management skills. Through microteaching episodes the STs put into practice, the acquired classroom skills within the critical yet safe environment of their peers before moving to the realities of the schools.

The STs further enhanced their planning and preparation skills while working with NMs during the the School Experience Phase of the NDIE Practicum. NMs not only assisted STs in lesson planning and preparation of teaching aids but also guide them for lesson teaching. The mentors also listened to the problems faced by their mentees and provided suggestions to overcome those problems.

STs exhibited some good personal skills throughout the school experience. These personal skills such as skill of showing confidence, skill of keeping adequate records and skill of showing stable work habits. However, as cooperative teachers did not rate student teachers’ personal skills at a high level, student teachers needed to improve their confidence, record keeping skills and skill of showing stable work habits.

Supervision by the cooperating teachers also helped STs enhance their teaching skills. They followed instructions given by the cooperating teachers and improved their teaching accordingly. However, there seemed to have some dissatisfaction among student teachers for some supervision styles exhibited by the cooperating teachers. These supervision styles appeared to be negative as they inhibited student teachers to grow professionally.

# 6. Recommendations

On the basis of data analysis and interpretations, the following recommendations for various aspects of the NDIE Practicum are made:

There must be the provision of intensive sessions on teaching aids preparation before the school experience. This will enable the student teachers to prepare subject relevant teaching aids more skilfully. Student teachers must be encouraged to collect as many activities and worksheets they can during the preparation phase of the NDIE Practicum so that they have resources ready to use well before time.   
More sessions of microteaching must be provided to the student teachers. These sessions will not only provide more opportunities for the student teachers to practice their teaching skills but also help student teachers to improve their content knowledge. NDIE mentors must provide more guidance to the student teachers in terms of their classroom performance. They must give equal time to each student teacher and provide them constructive feedback (i.e. feedback that can help them improve rather discourage them). NDIE must plan the practicum activities particularly the process of checking lessons of student teachers and supervision in collaboration with the cooperating teachers. This will not only help to improve the process of supervision in cooperating schools but also develop a sense of ownership for the process of supervision among the cooperating teachers.
