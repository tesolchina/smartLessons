# ABSTRACT

Keywords:   
EHE (English for higher education)   
Academic English   
Content-based instruction   
Content and language integration   
Teachers' practices   
Teachers' espoused beliefs

The aim of this research was to gain insights into the current state of English for Higher Education (EHE) teaching in Poland from the perspective of its key stakeholders - EHE teachers. A total of 128 EHE teachers employed in Polish universities participated in an online survey-based study that explored their self-reported practices and beliefs regarding various facets of teaching English at university level. On the one hand, the findings suggest that the participants place considerable emphasis on developing students' communicative and social skills as well as their lexical competence. On the other hand, the study also identified some language components that seem to receive insufficient attention in the classroom. In particular, pronunciation, academic writing, intercultural/pragmatic competence, and grammar are among the most neglected areas. The findings also confirm that EHE teachers are generally open to a shift from general to contentbased English teaching in the academic setting and willing to incorporate innovative technological solutions into their teaching. Nevertheless, the data suggest that there is a lack of ready. made materials for teaching specialized English and a need for more institutional guidance and support for EHE teachers.

# 1. Introduction

The impact English has had on the world of academia can hardly be overestimated. In the words of Smit (2013, p. 17) \*the Englishisation of HE [Higher Education] is an evident fact. More often than not English remains the preferrd medium of academic discourse as the global language of cience, in written as well as oral communiction (Archila & Truscott de Mejia, 2020, p. 2) and \*the leading language for the issemination of academic knowledge (Hamp-Lyons & Hyland, 2002, p. 1). The dominant role of English in the world of academia is further strengthened by the allpervasive indexation of research journals, published predominantly n English (Flowerdew, 2012 p. 301). Moreover, as noted by Smit (2013, p. 17), English is not only needed for academic and professional work, but is also becoming the primary language shared by students and teachers - i.e., their lingua franca.

Inevitably then, English, traditionally perceived as an object of academic instruction is gradually turning into a medium $\varprojlim 2$ carrier) of said instructio. As a result, the preference for standard English as a Foreign Language (EFL) courses has recently started to dwinde (Dearden & Macaro, 2016, p. 33), giving way to the further development of a whole range of specialized language tuition models (Crossman, 2018,p. 12; Czura et al., 2009, p. 177). This tendency is recognized by Gajewska-Skrzypczak and Sawicka (2016, p. 53) who note: [w]e would like to stressthe point very strongly that language tuition [at the tertiary level] cannot be detached from content teaching (..) experience has shown domain-specific technical language and content to be inseparable" [our translation].

Obviously, a change of these proportions does not happen overnight. Before it isembraced by HE institutions, it must be recognized and appreciated by all stakeholders (Perez Canado, 2014, p. 266) all the more so since it ofen involves disrupting the set routine of standard EFL courses, which - even if contextualized and communicative in nature -remain language oriented. Clearly, such a shift in focus necesstates profound methodological modifications, as firmly established EHE routines (e.g., techniques for teaching various language systems and skills, which work well for general English courses, do not suffice (Czura et al., 2009, p. 174). As noted in Walenta (2018, p. 2) they may compromise the authenticity of content-based teaching. Teachers may also lack the necessary skill for an increasingly multicultural setig (Gregersen-Hermans, 2017, p. 67). Add to this the exponential surge in online-teaching methods, necesstaed by the pandemic (Jelinska & Paradowski, 2021), and it becomes clear that EHE teaching has entered a relatively un. charted territory, requiring material design and adaptation, digital literacy and novel teaching methods on an unprecedented scale.

Importantly, despite the complexity of the issue, relatively littl research has been done on the existing practices, problems and expectations of EHE teachers, who are at the very forefront of the methodological shift (Niemela & Jauni, 2017, p. 78). As Escobar Urmeneta & Sanchez Sola (2009, p. 80 tres \*Milt is the responsibility of universities and not only of public administrations, tocarry out conclusive research to check whether the adopted pedagogical options produce the desired results. This quote recognizes the relevance of all stakeholders in shaping successul teaching procedure, and explicitly call for reearch into teachers persectives, before any long-term decisions about language policies in HE institutions are made.

This is precisely the niche which we intend to fillwith our study, in the context of tertiary education in Poland. Recognizing the growing complexity of demands and expectations placed on English-language instruction in higher education institutions, along with the paucity of research in this area, we conducted a survey among 128 English language teachers at Polish universities, with a view to examining their current practices and needs, as well as understanding the mindsets and belies underlying their teaching routines.

The following section constitutes a background account of existing research on the subject, against which it will be possible to meaningfully juxtapose our findings.

# 2. Background research

The overview of research on EHE practices is divided into three sections. Section $2 . 1$ zooms in on the gradual shift from general EHE provision (with no specific content focus) to targeted, content-based EHE teaching, as wellas its methodological roos. Section 2.2 provides an overview of current top-down policie toward EHE provision, with a focus on the Polish educational scene, while Section 2.3 moves on to examine documented challenges in the area.

# 2.1. Toward content-based teaching in EHE

As outlined above, a major recent development in the area of language teaching methodology at the tertiary level has been a gradual shift from general language courses toward content-driven tuition. As advocated by the proponents of content-based methodologies, standard EFL courses restrict content focus and, as such, develop \*a static set of skill" (Aleksandrak, 2018, p. 139), inadequate for the dynamic requirements of the modern world, where literacy in multiple disciplines i indispensable for sucessul communication (Meyer & Coyle, 2017, p. 202). This is particularly relevant in the context of EHE, since "all academic English is neessarily contxtualied . ee if thre may be rtain features that ae (..) genealizable acos discilines (Murray, 2016, p. 440).

The attested inseparability of language and content lends justification to and encourages further development of a whole range of content-oriented tuition models, which may be roughly subdivided into three types: a) language-driven - e.g., English for Specific Purposes (ESP), English for Academic Purposes (EAP); b) content-driven - e.g., English Medium Instruction (EMI); and c) integrative - e.g., Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL).

Al the types above acknowledge the growing role of content in EHE provision, albeit t varying degres, with type a) being focused on teaching vocabulary and phrases associated with specific content - academic (Walsh Marr & Mahmood, 2021) and/or occupational (Rahman, 2015); type b) treating English as a medium of intruction (Doiz et al., 2011); and type c) explicitly acknowledging and subscribing to the dual objective of teaching language and content (Coyle & Meyer, 2021; Lyster, 2018).

A word of caution is needed at ths point. While the distinction between types a), b) and c) above, as adopted in this article is wel. established in the litrature (e.g. Caro-Pastor, 2020b; Ruiz de Zarobe & Lyster, 2018), it should be considered a necessary simplfication. First and foremost, depending on gographical, political, and methodologial variables, diffrent intrrttions are possible. For instance, CLIL, despite explicitly standing for Content and Language Integrated Learning, is often used to describe bilingual contexts where content claes are taught in an additional anguage, with littl to noattntion paid to the languag itelf (linares & Morton, 2017). At the same time, while EMI i typically delivered by content experts (rather than language specialists) (e.g., Airey, 2020), it is as inrsingly langage-ensitie as content sialis are oseved to egag wth inguistic isues to facilitate subject matter transmission (e.g., Cammarata & Tedick, 2012; Macaro, 2020). In consequence, as Coffin (2017) states, the "once unproblematic distinctions' between CLIL, EMI, EFL, and content teaching "will increasingly blur and coalesce' (p. 101).

Regardless of the exact type of tuition, there are a lot of arguments in support of merging language and content teaching in HE. As argued by the proponents of the Pluriliteracies Approach (PA) - which refines and develops current thinking in CLIL (Coyle & Meyer,

2021)-for laning to be successful, i must ridge the interal proces of knowledge construction (content) wth the extenal process of knowledge communication (language) (Meyer & Coyle, 2017, p. 204). As such, PA aligns with Halliday' framework (2007), which assumes that the learning of the disciplinary content is tantamount to learning the language of the discipline (Crandal & Tucker, 1990), hence proving itself suitable for HE programs.

The advantages of the dual (i., content/language) focus are well established by research. As demonstrated by numerous studies (Dalton-Puffer, 2007; Jimenez Catalan & Ruiz de Zarobe, 2009), blending linguistic and content-related objectives, not only helps students acquire subject mattr, but aso develops their receptive, lexical, and conversational proficiency in the second/foreign lan guage (L2). Importantl, such gains generally carry over from secondary to tertiary educational setigs (Lyster, 2018; Ruiz de Zarobe & Lyster, 2018; Ruiz de Zarobe & Zenotz, 2018). As documented by cros-sectional studies (Perez Canado, 2018),content-based EHE teaching positively inluences students' overall academic performance (p. 60) and produces long-lasting results (p. 62). It also enhances students higher-level skill, including argumentation and conclusion drawing (Fernandez-Fontechaet al, 2020; Walsh Marr & Mahmood, 2021, p. 6), and thus constitutes the necessary foundation for the dynamic growth of Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency (CALP) (Cummins, 1979).

Naturall, content-based language teaching in EHE faces some challenges - such as achieving a balanced provision of language systems and skills (Ruiz de Zarobe & Lyster, 2018; Valcke & Wilknson, 2017). Stil, as briefl outlined above, there exist a number of well-grounded reasons for HE to embrace the dual-focus. The major implication is that literacy in content subject prepares student for successful communication across dsciplines, cultures and languages, thus beter equipping them for "responsible global citizenship" (Meyer & Coyle, 2017, p. 202) - a highly desirable outcome for any HE program.

# 2.2. National and institutional policies toward EHE

The shift toward content-based EHE isoften additionally motivated by legal considerations. In the context of Polish education, for example, as decreed by the Ministry of Science and Higher Education, a B.A. graduate, in addition to a B2-level competence in an L2, "needs to know a specialized variety of the language he or she has been learning" (Dzieciol-Pedich, 2015, p. 6).

By and large, this is a legitimate and realistic goal, since secondary school graduates receive a thorough grounding in general English at the level of B1 and B2, as evidenced by the results of Matura exams (cnska t al., 2022). The B2-lel competenceatthe start of academic tuition is not only a solid scafold for further pecialized language provision but also a reason why alternatives to general-English courses need to be offered: first-year students have already done a few years of foreign-language training at the secondary-school level. Consequently, as noted by Dzieciol-Pedich (2015, p. 5): \*higher education institutions offr language courses for specific purposes so as to avoid teaching the same linguistic content for the second or third time. Moreover, Gajewska-Skrzypczak and Sawicka (2016, p. 55) underscore the need for meeting students' expectations and offering course aligned to their academic interests.

Importantly, while every country has it own language policy, including guidelines for bilingual education, these guidelines are not based on any extensive research (Dearden, 2015, p. 32) and represent more of a\*wishful thinking approach Crossman, 2018, p. 564) To exemplify, Czura et al. (2009, p. 177) note the lack of cooperation between secondary and tertiary \*bilingual education streams. Archila and Truscott de Mejia (2020, p. 4) point out that ilingual practices in universty cience courses should be research-based, while Dearden and Macaro (2016, p. 480) call for more institutional support to be lent to bilingual teachers.

The lack of higher-level guidelines goes hand-in-hand with insufficient training options offered to in-service teachers (Macaro et al. 2021, p. 109). Such courses are relatively rare for a number of reasons: inadequate financial resources (Czura et al., 2009, p. 175) and regulations atthe national level (edick, 2013, p. 535), lack of cooperation between the stakeholders (Archila et a., 2022 p. 2687) and administrative inertia of HE institutions (Kabat, 2017, p. 26). The shortage i further related to the lack of eaily accessible teaching materials (Dzieciot-Pedich, 2015, p.11), particularly for technical universties (Gajewska-Skrzypczak & Sawicka, 2016, p. 53)

Importantly, the deficits are duly noted by EHE teachers themselves, who express the need for more institutional support and regular training programs dedicated to content-based teaching. Specificall, curriculum adjustments, trainings in bilingual education, and acces to content-based EHE reources, including multimedia software and online materials, are wished for (Archila et al., 2022, p. 11, Czura et al, 209, p. 174, Perez Canado, 2014, p. 283). As stressed by EHE teachers, these willbe intrumenta in developing their professional identity (Leavy et al., 2018; Tedick & Zilmer, 2020, p. 139, p. 87) and wl help them with tenure, contract renewal or financial status (Zappa-Hollman, 2018, p. 13).

# 2.3. Present challenges in EHE teaching

As outlined above, EHE teachers are at the forefront of a major methodological shift, with the English language gradually changing its traditional \*subject" status into that of a carrier of instruction, aimed at increasingly multicultural/multilingual student populations. This necesstates the introduction of novel teaching methods, material, and tols, as well s a proficient adaptation of the digital educational scene, in the aftermath of the CovID pandemic. The lack of coherent regulations and insufficient institutional support for EHE teachers, coupled with the relative shortage of research into teaching practice (see the discussion above), only aggravate the problem. These factors result in the attested imbalance in teaching language systems and skill, including insufficient us on the intercultural/pragmatic competence - all of which are briefly outlined below.

Before moving on, a brief explanation of the systems and skills targeted in the study seems in place. The commonly accepted approach to conceptualizing linguistic competence for pedagogical purposes (see Common European Framework of Reference [CEFR] (Council of Europe, 2001) adhered to in this paper, identifies four subcompetences (levels of analysis for pedagogical purposes: phonetics/phonology, morphology, syntax and semantics. These correspond to the traditionally recognized "language subsystems' in Foreign Language (FL) provision: a) pronunciation, subsuming elements of articulatory phonetics and occasional phonological insights, b) grammar, which covers morpho-syntax, and c) vocabulary resources, instantiating semantic subcompetence-dictionary entries for individual lexical items and fixed phrases. To this list we add pragmatic and soco-cultural competences (see Council of Europe, 2001, p. 13), a powerful discourse-enabling factor, responsible for clasroom interaction as much as for intercultural communication and the creation of "speaker meaning" distinct from \*sentence meaning. The remaining categories addresed in our survey are the commonly recognized language skills (listening, speaking, reading, writing).

In terms of language systems - teaching grammar has been put on the defensive,so much so that the CEFR Companion Volume explicitly stated that: \*there is (..) no suggestion that one should stop teaching grammar (Council of Europe, 2020, p. 29). This problem is further exacerbated in content-driven EHE instruction, where a focus on content is frequently linked to a system defocus, as systematic provision of morpho-syntactic information is no longer prioritized or attended to on a regular basis (Lyster, 2017). Importantly, while formal correctness may play a secondary role in everyday communication, it is required for the development of professional academic discourse (Walsh Marr & Mahmood, 2021, p. 2). Yet, deficits in students' linguistic competence have been repeatedly noted in that regard (Tedick & Zilmer, 2020, p. 120).

Similarly, the writing skill - as important as speaking in an academic context (Dzieciol-Pedich, 2015, p. 11) - is an area where accurate delivery has retained its importance (Orduna Nocito & Obernyer, 2020, p. 32). However, problems with students' written production have also een observed (Meyer & Coyle, 2017, p. 200). Moreover, as documented by research, EHE teachers are reluctant to set written assignments, with a strong preference instead toward reading tasks (Mazak & Herbas-Donoso, 2015).

If writing skills become challenging at the academic level, so is academic speaking (Kir & Akyiz, 2020, p. 170). Yet, this aspect is often not catered for, since a lot of EHE teaching relies on lecture-based delivery, with severely limited in-clas interaction (Lyster. 2017, p. 10), ften reduced to decontextualized lexical items (Niemela & Jauni, 2017 p. 87). The challenge is made even more acute by the notable absence of pronunciation practice (Lasagabaster, 2021, p. 173). This, in turn, may not only hamper successul message communication/comprehension, but also the development of students' higher order thinking skils, indispensable in an HE setting (Meyer & Coyle, 2017, p. 200). As Smit (2010, p. 260) explains, academic language proficiency should emerge as a result of content negotiations in the proces that she call interactive explaining, in a sufficiently complex thus, motivating) context (Kong & Hoare, 2011, p. 321). Yet, such contexts rarely feature in EHE (O'Dowd, 2018, p. 555).

Finall, the atested move toward internationalization of EHE (Archila et a., 2022), has profound socio-pragmatic implications, as knowledge transmission and negotiation are taking place in an increasingly multilingual and multicultural stting, which need to be addressed for the language teaching to be successful. As early as in 1989 Byram (p. vii)viewed foreign language education as an emancipation from the confines of one's native habitat in culture, warning that excesive emphasis on language teaching as skil training is "apt to lose that from sight (cf. Kovacs, 2017 for more discussion). That observation was as relevant then as it is now (cf. Aleksandrowicz-Pedich et al., 2003; Coperias Aguilar, 2007; Sercu, 2005). It is also one of the basic assumptions of the CLIL model itself (cf. Do Coyle's seminal work on the 4Cs: content, communication, cognition and culture, e.g., Coyle et al., 2010).

Yet, as research shows, such skill as pragmatic or intercultural communication are not sufficientl attended to in EHE teaching (Carrio-Pastor, 2020a; 2020b) and professional development programs in that regard are scarce (Perez Canado, 2014, p. 283)

# 3. The present study

# 3.1. Study aims

Given the insights outlined above, this study pursued four main research objectives. First, it investigated if English-language in struction in higher education provides a well-balanced emphasis on various aspects of the L2. Based on the literature overview (e.g, Carrio-Pastor, 2020a, 2020b; Lasagabaster, 2021; Mazak & Herbas-Donoso, 2015), we hypothesized that the development of some L2 systems and sils, such as writing, pronunciation, and intercultural/pramatic kills, might be considerably neglcted in the majority of HE curricula.

Secondly, we investigated to what extent EHE teaching is content-based and whether it is balanced in terms of focus on different aspects of the L2. With respect to this research aim, drawing from the litrature review (e.g, Meyer & Coyle, 2017; Ruiz de Zarobe & Lyster, 2018; Walsh Marr & Mahmood, 2021), we predicted that fostering grammatical ccuracy and writing sils is lrgely under represented in content-based instruction, which is generally dominated by the focus on specialized vocabulary and reading comprehension.

Third, we wanted to further explore which types of teaching materials (e.g., coursebooks, self-designed materials, ready-made didactic materials available online) are commonly used by EHE teachers, and whether there is a need for the provision of any particular type of didactic resources in the context of HE (cf. Dzieciol-Pedich, 2015; Gajewska-Skrzypczak & Sawicka, 2016).

Finally, to complete the picture, we explored teachers' espoused beliefs about the isues raised above, with reference to the role of content (e.g., Dalton-Puffer, 2007; Meyer & Coyle, 2017), linguistic accuracy (e.g, Lyster, 2017; Tedick & Zilmer, 2020), and social skills (e.g, Perez Canado, 2014, p. 283) in the teaching process as well as the role of two external factors,co-shaping teachers performance intitutional support (cf. Dearden and Macaro, 2016) and digital competence (use of novel technologies) (e.g., Jelinska &

# Paradowski, 2021).

Thus, this study explored the following research questions (RQs 1-4).

(1) Do teachers balance the coverage of different language systems and skill in their own EHE teaching?   
(2) Do teachers balance the coverage of different language systems and skill in their own content-based EHE teachin   
(3a) what type of didactic materials do EHE teachers use the most?   
(3b) Does the range of didactic materials available meet the needs and expectations of EHE teachers?   
(4) What are EHE teachers' espoused beliefs about: a) the use of novel technologies, b) the importance of promoting linguistic accuracy, c) the importance of developing students' social skills, d) the need for recognition and institutional support, e) the role of content in EHE provision?

# 3.2. Materials and methods

# 3.2.1. Instrument

The current study took the form of an online questionnaire, including 20 open-ended and 24 closed-ended questions (five-point Likert scale, yes/no, and multiple-choice). The instrument comprised three parts and focused on: (1) general demographic information, (2) questions related to teaching practices and techniques, (3) questions related to teachers' needs and espoused beliefs. While constructing the questionnaire, we firs selected the areas (i.e., topics) to be addressed based on the EHE literature review, and then developed individual items to tap into those areas. In particular, we focused on identifying problematic ssues in L2 teaching at the tertiary level worldwide see sections 2.1 - 2.3 above), to explore how far they might aly to the Polish context. We then prepared the first draft of the tool, whose content validity was examined via consulting expert judges, i.e., 20 specialists in applied lingustics with experience in tertiary L2 English teaching and an expert in educational psychology. The experts were asked to consider the extent to Which the survey items covered relevant facets of EHE and to asesstheir wording in terms of content and clarity. Following these consultations, the questionnaire was revised and piloted on 9 in-service EHE teachers, who ook the survey and recommended further revisions, which included: rephrasing some questions or complementing them with examples to improve clarity as well as technical adjustments to the survey layout. Notably, due to the formal propertie of the instrument, which was not a scale tapping into any latent variable, theulation f its reliability (i.e. intal consistency) was not possibl The current stdy rort oly the reults that are relevant to the research aims outlined in section 3.1 above. For the survey questions analyzed in the present stud, ee Appendix A, Part 1.

# 3.2.2. Procedure

This study was conducted to contribute to the report on EHE in Poland, which was prepared as part of the TE-Con3 (Teaching English as a Content Subject at the Tertiary Level) Erasmus $^ +$ Project.3 The data for this study were collected via an online questionnaire distributed among English teachers from sixeen major universities in Poland. fficial invitations to particiate in the survey were sent out by email to over 180 representatives of higher education institution in Poland offering English language programs or providing EHE courses for students of various majors. Sixten unit, twelve of which were public and four private, responded to the invitation and participated in the survey. The data collection took place in 2021, afer pilot testing. The survey was administered in English, as the study was aimed at English language professionals from different L1 backgrounds. The questionnaire imposed no time limit, and i took approximately 15-20 minutes tocomplete. The teachers were informed that heir participation in the study was fully voluntary and assured of the anonymity of their responses. They were also notified about their unconditional right to withdraw from the study at any stage.

# 3.2.3. Participants

128 tertiary level English language teachers took part in the survey. In terms of gender, the majority of the respondents $( 8 3 \% )$ were female, with $^ { 1 5 \% }$ male participants and $2 \%$ of the participants preferring not to say. In terms of age, most of the respondents $( 3 7 \% )$ were between 31 and 50 years of age, with ${ } ^ { 2 3 \% }$ between 51 and 60 years of age, $1 9 \%$ above 60, $^ { 1 5 \% }$ between 31 and 40, $4 \%$ between 21 and 30, and $2 \%$ of the respondents preferring not to say. Polish was the native language for the majority $( 9 5 \% )$ of the respondents, with $2 \%$ being native English speakers and $^ { 1 \% }$ bilingual in Polish and English. In addition, $1 \%$ of teachers had Bulgarian or Spanish as their native language each.

Regarding English teaching experience in HE, $3 4 \%$ of the respondents taught there for over 25 years, $2 3 \%$ for 21-25 years, $1 6 \%$ for 16-20 years, $9 \%$ for 11-15 years, $1 0 \%$ for 6-10 years, and $9 \%$ for less than 5 years. Most teachers $( 8 0 \% )$ were employed by public HE institutions, $1 6 \%$ worked in both public and private ones, and $4 \%$ worked exclusively in private universities. In terms of affiliations, $6 8 \%$ of the respondents worked in separate Foreign Language Center units, $2 8 \%$ in specific faculties, and $4 \%$ in both. Regarding the type of EFL courses taught, general English was taught by $7 6 \%$ , ESP by $7 1 \%$ , EAP by $5 3 \%$ EMI by $4 0 \%$ , and CLIL by $1 4 \%$ of the respondents. As for their education, 122 participants held an academic degree in English studies or applied linguistics (87 - MA, 34 - PhD, 1 - BA). The remaining six participants did not provide the details regarding the field of their degree; however, based on their employment history, as reported in the survey, it can be inferred that they also majored in English studies or related disciplines.

# 3.3. Analysis

We operationalized the attention paid to language systems and skill as the self-reported frequency of teaching them in the EHE classrom. To explore possile differences in teacher's focus on those 2 components, we used Friedman's ANOVA, which is well suited for comparing multiple dependent groups when assumptions for parametric tests are not met (here, the dependent variable was measured on an ordinal cale). Further post hoc analyses were carried out via the stepwise step-down procedure. The procedure clusters homogenous variable levels in the same column. Consequently, variable levels included in the same subset do not differ significantly from one another, as indicated by the asymptotic ignificance levels adjusted for multiple comparisons (see Field, 2018) The same method was aplied to investgate the use of dfferent didactic resources and the nees related to their provision. The second part of the survey, tapping teachers beliefs about various aspects of HE, was more exploratory; therefore, the analyses were largely limited to decriptive statistics. Additionll, those questions were analyzed using a chi-square test to examine whether one of the two positions on an ssue (agreement or disagreement) prevailed among the respondents. The analyses were carried out with IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 28.0. The graphs were designed in the gpot2 (Wickham, 2016) package in R (R Core Team, 2023). In al the an. alyses, the assumed significance level was $p < . 0 5$

# 3.4. Results

# 3.4.1. Focus on different language systems and skills in EHE teaching

In the first step (RQ1), we investigated if EHE instruction is balanced in terms of teacher focus on different aspects of L2 English (i., systms and kills). Table 1 and Fig 1 show decriptive statistics and frequencies of the answers to the urvey question, How often do you teach the ollowing systes and kills?For the numeric data on the frequencies, see Appendix, Part . For the justfication of the specific systems and skills addressed in RQ1, see section 2.3 above.

The results showed the significant main effect of the type of L2 system/skill, $\chi _ { \mathrm { F } } ^ { 2 } \left( 8 \right) = 2 2 7 . 6 7 , p < . 0 0 1$ . The subsequent stepwise step-down analysis revealed three homogenous subsets of language systems/skills. The first subset (with the lowest rank scores) included teaching pragmatics and culture, writing, grammar, and pronunciation $\left( p = . 6 3 1 \right)$ , showing that those areas receive the least attention in EHE. The second subset incorporated listening, reading, fixed phrases and vocabulary, i.e., individual words $\left( p = . 4 7 3 \right)$ Teaching those was more common than the competences in subset one. Finally, the last subset included a single linguistic skil that clustered on its own - peaking, which reied the greatest atention in the HE clasroom, as compared to all the other aspects of L2 targeted in the present study. The homogenous subsets together with their mean ranks and significance values (adjusted) are shown in Table 2. As shown, speaking surpasses allthe other aspects of L2 investigated in the survey in terms of teaching time devoted to it $( M o d e = 5$ $M d n = 5$ . As many as 100 respondents $( 7 8 . 1 \%$ of the whole sample) reported that they always attend to speaking skills during their classes and only 3 participants (about $2 . 3 \%$ of the sample) declared that they rarely include speaking activities in their teaching (nobody declared that they never teach speaking). Paradoxically, teaching pronunciation was much les frequent $( M o d e = 4 ,$ $M d n = 4 )$ , with 39 participants (i.e., about $3 0 . 5 \%$ of the whole sample) reporting that they always teach this skill, and 15 participants $( 1 1 . 7 \% )$ claiming that they never or rarely attend to it in the classroom. Also, writing as a productive skillturned out to be neglected when compared to speaking $( M o d e = 4$ $M d n = 4 \Re$ , as it was reported to be always taught by merely 27 teachers (about $2 1 . 1 \%$ and rarely taught by 13 respondents (about $1 0 . 2 \%$ of the sample).

# 3.4.2. Focus on different language systems and skills in content-based EHE

A parallel analysis was carried out t explore RQ2, asking whether teachers balance the coverage of different language systems and skil in their own content-based EHE teaching see Table 3 and Fig. 2 for descriptive statistics and frequencies, respectively).For the numeric data on the frequencies, see Appendix A, Part 2.

Similar to the previously reported results, ifferent aspects of language were shown to diffr in how frequently they are taught via content, $\chi _ { \mathrm { F } } ^ { 2 } \left( 8 \right) = 2 3 4 . 6 1$ $p < . 0 0 1$ . The subsequent stepwise step-down analysis showed that grammar, pronunciation, as well as pragmatics and culture are least frequently taught via content $( p = . 2 3 4 )$ . On the other extreme (subset 5), the largest amount of teaching time in content-based instruction is devoted to lexis (including fied phrases as wel as individual words), as wel as reading and speaking skills $( p = . 6 4 0 )$ . It needs to be noted that there was a considerable overlap between the clusters, as some systems/skills fell into more than a single group. The homogenous subsets together with their mean ranks and sigificance values (adjusted) are shown in Table 4.

# 3.4.3. Didactic materials used by EHE teachers

Next (RQ3a), we analyzed the frequency of using the following didactic resources by the teachers: coursebooks, authentic mate rial, rd-made ddactic matrials ., thoseavailable onthe Inenet), self-designed or adaptd matrials (e Table 5 and Fig. 3for descriptive statistics and frequencies, respectively; for the numeric data on the frequencies, see Appendix A, Part 2.

The result of Friedman's AnovA indicated that the frequency of using those four types of resources differed, $\chi _ { \mathrm { F } } ^ { 2 } \left( 3 \right) = 3 8 . 0 8$ $p < . 0 0 1$ . The stepwise step-down analysis revealed that ready-made didactic materials were used to a lesser extent than the remaining types of teaching resource. However, no differences were noted for the use of coursebooks, authentic materials and self-designed/

# 3.4.5. EHE teachers' espoused beliefs

In analyzing questions concerning teachers' beliefs about EHE practices (RQ4) for each question we pooled answers definitely agree' and agree, as well as defintely dsagree and disagree into wo discrete categories corresponding to 1) agreeor (2) disagree (for the raw frquencies for this part f the urvey s Apdi , Part ). hen fo ech question, a chi-quare gooessof fit test was used to compare if the dstributions (i.e, raes) of gre and disagee responsesdiffere significantly or were evenly split between categories. Answers hard to say, were excluded from the stistical analyses; however, their frequencies are reported in Tables 9-13. In what follows, the presentatio of the results wl be organized around the ollowing themes, as specified in RQ4a-4e a the useof novel technologies, b) the importance of promoting lingustic ccuracy,c) the importance of developing students social skills d) the need for recognition and for institutional support, and e) the role of content in EHE provision.

When asked about the ffectivenes of distance learning (se Table 9), as compared to tradtional in-clss learning, 48 respondents agreed or definitely agreed with the statement, whereas 48 teachers expressed some degree of disagreement with such a claim. Thus, there is alot of variety regarding teachers beliefs about the efectivenes of distance learning. However, when enquired about thir willingnes to experiment with using novel teaching methods, as many as 96 respondents endorsed the statement, and only 5 teachers disagreed with it, $\chi ^ { 2 } \left( 1 \right) = 8 1 . 9 9$ $p < . 0 0 1$ , which indicates the prevalence of positive over negative attitudes toward the implementation of technological novelty into teaching. Finally, when asked about being cautious about novel tchnologies in the clssoom, significantly more teachers disagreed (84 respondents) than agreed with this statement (22 respondents), $\chi ^ { 2 } \left( 1 \right) = 3 6 . 2 6$ $p < . 0 0 1$ Thus, even though openness and geral optiism toward the use of novel technologies in HE preailed, there were stil teachers who were not at ease with the use of innovative technology-based teaching methods.

The next topic targeted in the survey dealt with the importance of developing students' accuracy in L2 English see Table 10). When   
asked whether it was necessary to put emphasis on accurate language use, teachers who greed with the statement (64) outnumbered   
those who disagreed with it (23) by a considerable margin, $\chi ^ { 2 } ( 1 ) = 1 9 . 3 2 , p < . 0 0 1 .$ Still, as many as 41 respondents had no clear opinions   
about the ssue. Next, when asked to ssess if Itis hard to eradicate language errors, 52 respondents agreed, 37 disagreed, $\chi ^ { 2 } ( 1 ) = 2 . 5 3 , p =$

The statement The et way to lea  foregn languag is through intection with lssmates, was supported by as many as 90 respondents,   
and rejected by merely 7 respondents, which indicates that the majority of teachers endorse this type of learning, $\chi ^ { 2 } ( 1 ) = 7 1 . 0 2 , p < . 0 0 1$   
Similarly, the vast majority of tachers (114) endorsed the statement that An important aspect f language teaching is to develop student's

# 4. Discussion

The study set out to explore current practices, needs and belies of EHE teachers in Poland. The questions are discussed below chronologically, with the exception of research questions 4b, 4c, and 4e, which provide additional insights into the issues probed in questions 1-3 and are thus considered together.

With regard to rearch question (1), the study found that EHE teaching in Poland is not balanced in terms of language systems and skil. Spaking is the skil that receives the greatestattention in HE teching (but se the dicussion below), followed by vocabulary (isolated words and collocations), reading, and listening. Intercultural/pragmatic competence, writing, pronunciation, and grammar turned out to be the most neglected areas. The results confirm the pattern observed in other studies (Lasagabaster, 2021; Lyster, 017; Niemela & Jauni, 2017; O'Dowd, 2018; Tedick & Zilmer, 2020). (See also section 2.3 above).

The observed focus on speaking resonates with the espoused beliefs of EHE teachers, as investigated in research question (4c), Where the majority of respondents agreed that the best way to learn a foreign language is through interaction with classmates.

An interestin ar reveal selfhre While ofattentio is pad  the aking kill as th ts show, themphs sems to be laid on its lexical makeup, with both pronunciation and more complex discourse functions being left behind. The apparent paradox (confirmed by other rearch,., Lasagabaster, 2021) may eattributed to the dee-seated conviction among EHE teachers that exposure to academic language is enough to trigger its successul acquisition (Dearden, 2015, p. 32). Consequently, receptive kills (readng, listening) and iolated lexical items are given a lot ofattention in the classoom. Atthe same time aadmic writing and mportant aspects of speaking (g, pronunciation practice intercultural/pragmatic competence) - are neglected. Even though practicing simple skils and isolated words and phrase rovides instantaneous acessto meaning (cf. Gozdawa-Golebiowski, 2003, p. 150) their dominance in the HE classroom may compromise the complexity and nuances of academic discourse (Walsh Marr & Mahmood, 2021, p. 3.

Such an unwarranted simplification also transpired through the observed neglect of grammar teaching in EHE provision. As Walsh Marr andMahmoo (2021, p.2) point out, principled tentiont linguistic formisnessay fthe gl i to acquirecontive aademic language proficiency, which goes way beyond lexis and simplified rules in order to ensure cohesion, fluency, and logical connections (Meyer & Coyle, 2017, p. 200). The position of grammar teaching in EHE was also reflected in research question (4b) whose results indicate that the importance of teaching grammatical accuracy is debatable, and sometimes marginalized among EHE teachers.

Added to the purely linguistic imbalance, the results also indicate that EHE teaching places littl attention on the development of students' intercultural/pragmatic competence, the least practice skil in the EHE classroom. This result stands in stark contrast with the fact that most respondents believe that an important aspect of EHE teaching is to develop students' social skill (research question 4c). Considering that EHE teaching, in its progressvely internationalized and multicultural context, aims to prepare students for successful communication across disciplines, cultures, and languages (Meyer & Coyle, 2017, p. 202), the neglect of teaching intercultural/pramatic skill is somewhat disturbing. Those, as reearch shows, are unlikely to develop on their own, unles their growth is supported by adequate instruction (Deardorff & Arasaratnam-Smith, 2017).

Regarding the teaching of various language aspects via content, adressed in question (2), the study found that content-based EHE is increasingly popular in Poland. As described in section 3.2 above, teaching ESP courses was declared by almost as many of the respondents as teaching general English courses ( $7 1 \%$ and $7 6 \%$ , respectively). EAP and EMI also ranked high, being taught by $5 3 \%$ and $4 0 \%$ of the teachers, respectively. While CLIL might seem underrepresented ( $1 4 \%$ of the respondents declared teaching it), this could be attributed to terminological reasons, as in Poland the term \*CLIL i typically asociated with lower-level education (Romanowski, 2022). Further evidence for the increasing popularity of content-based teaching came from research question (4d), where the majority of the respondents $( 7 4 \% )$ agreed that effective EHE teaching should be based on specialized content.

Unfortunately, the growing popularity of content-based EHE in Poland, goes hand-in-hand with the lack of balance in teaching language systems and skills observed for EHE teaching in general (see research question (1) above). Intercultural/pragmatic competence, grammar, pronunciation and writing, again, emerge as the most neglected aspects. Cruciall, for content-based EHE teaching, isolated words were found to be the most frequently taught language area while grammar was taught the least. Reducing content-based teaching t teaching specialized lexis has en attested for some time already (Coyle et al., 2010; Dalton-Puffer, 2007, p. 10), yet - as shown by the present results - the tendency is still very pronounced.

Moving on to the use of didactic resources and teachers' needs in that regard - as addressed in research questions (3a) and (3b)-the study revealed that ready-made materials are used the least, in comparison to coursebooks, authentic/elf-designed resources, or adaptations. This might be atributed to the inadequacy or lack of ready-made aids available on educational platorms. The results are further supported by th fact that the most sought-after categories are ready-made resource for teaching specialized English, content in English, and online courses. These findings are not surprising, a course instructors - due to their high workload (Dziecio-Pedich, 2015, p.11; Gajewska & Sowa, 2015,p.228) and often limited content-subject expertis (Morton, 2018, p. 278; Perez Canado, 2017, p. 88) - are reluctant to create specialized materials themselves. Characteristically, the demand for content-based materials and online materials surpassed the need for GE teaching resources, further affrming the growing popularity of content-based teaching and the ongoing digitalization of education.

In terms of research question (4a), it was found that there is a lot of variety regarding teachers' beliefs about the ffectiveness of distance larning. This rflects, on the one hand, the oserved satisfaction with diil lening (Kochanska et al., 2021; opcial, 2018, p. 61), and on the other hand, the attested problems with using online tols, possibly due to the lack of training (Mozejko & Krajka, 2011). At the same time, openness and general optimism toward the use of novel technologies in EHE prevail, with the majorit of the respondents readily trying them out.

The last sue probed by the questionnaire was the need for institutional support and recognition (research question 4e). Given the increasing Englishisation of higher education, along with the challenges that accompany it i is not surprising that the vast majority of respondents wished for more acknowledgment f the role of English in university curricula, as wellas the validation of EHE teachers role in preparing students for active European citizenship (although the later may come as something of a surprise, given the observed neglect of intercultural/pragmatic skill in EHE teaching, see the iscussion above). Additionally, a significant majority of the respondents acknowledged the need for more institutional guidelines for EHE teaching.

Taken together, the results suggest that considerable attention in EHE is devoted to the development of students' communicative skil, with EHE teachers stressing the importance of classroom interaction and the development of students' social skill. The results also confirm the growing popularity of content-based teaching in Polish EHE and reveal a general optimism and openness toward incorporating novel technologies into the EHE classroom.

On a less positive note, the results show that EHE teaching in Poland lacks balance, with certain language systems and skill being neglected. Pronunciation, academic writing, and intercultural/pragmatic competence are among the most overlooked areas. Grammar also receives inadequate attention, despite it crucial role in developing academic language proficiency. Such neglect may hinder students' effectiveness in expressing themseles (or even their wllingness t communicate in an intenationalized academic and/or professional setting. Additionally, there is limited provision of ready-made material for teaching specialized Englis, as well as insufficient institutional guidelines and support options for EHE teachers.

# 5. Conclusions

The increasing role of English in the world of academia is a fact. Its growing status means growing responsibilites and challenges. These need to be identified and adressd if EHE is to fully meet its objectives of preparing students to become responsible global citizens. This study aimed to provide insights into the current state of HE teaching in Poland, aseen by its key stakeholders - the EHE teachers themselves. While there are positive aspects, such as the growing popularity of content-based teaching and enthusiasm for incorporating novel technologies, there are also significant challenges that need to be addressed, including the pronounced neglect of certain language systems and skills and limited access to appropriate teaching materials.

Therefore, efort should be made to help students atain the required level of proficiency in English. This implies far-reaching changes on the educational scene, starting with, but not limited to, tertiary language provision. Meaningful content-based teaching presupposes teaching language through content and, simultaneously, teaching content through language. As suggested by our results, it may be a welcome and anticipated development, but there is a marked shortage of ready-made materials and teacher-training opportunities. Further studies addressing these issues and exploring diffrent contexts, may provide the necessary impetus for the development of alternative teaching model. Based on our findings, these models need to be: a) multdisciplinary (reflcting a range of academic disiplines, relevant for active citizenship), b) culture-rich (central to appreciating otherness), c) language-sensitive (providing a balanced provision of language systems and skills), and d) promoting social/interactive skill.

More research is needed to further explore these issues. Stil, we hope that our study, by outlining the present potential and challenges of EHE instruction, might contributeto improving the quality of EHE provision globall, thereby securing a better chance for students to successfully function in the increasingly globalized world.

# Funding

The work was supported by the Polish Erasmus $^ +$ National Agency (FRsE Foundation) grant awarded to University of Warsaw [project number: 2020-1-PL01-KA203-081894]. The study was conducted to contrbute to the report on EHE in Poland, which was prepared as part of the TE-Con3 (Teaching English as a Content Subject at the Tertiary Level) Erasmus+ Project. Comparable versions of the survey were also developed for the remaining Partner Universities involved in the Project: Berlin - Humboldt (Germany), Faro (Portugal), Pitesti (Romania) and Tallinn (Estonia).
