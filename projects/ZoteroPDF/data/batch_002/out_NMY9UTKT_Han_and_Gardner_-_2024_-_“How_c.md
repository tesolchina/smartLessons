Previous studies have shown that as L2 writing develops from intermediate to advanced levels, addition is marked less often and the use of and decreases as the use of moreover, furthermore and other less frequent addition markers increases. This study goes further in that it examines first how addition is marked in different academic disciplines and genres, and secondly how addition markers and their collocates are used by Chinese students in comparison to L1 writers of English. For the first question, and in contrast to Peacock's (2010) analysis of research articles, addition markers are used more in this student writing in the sciences of Engineering, Food Sciences and Biology than in the social sciences of Business and Law, and more in the more scientific writing of lab report genres than the discursive writing of essays. Such variation reinforces the importance of genre and discipline differences in teaching second language writing. For the second question, a qualitative analysis reveals the important difference between stringing several points using addition markers and grouping points into one argument using a shell noun, or reinforcing one argument with collocates. These findings lead to specific suggestions for L2 academic writing teachers.

# 1. Introduction

Addition markers are practical resources for university students to organize their arguments, and information in their arguments notably in writing. They are one of the crucial types of discourse marker to express relations between main clauses or sentences (e.g., in addition, furthermore). Thus, they are a focus in teaching academic writing in English. Adition markers have ben investigated from three main perspectives: transition markers in Hyland's (2005) metadiscourse (Han & Gardner, 2021; Walkova, 2020); discourse markers and conjunctions as cohesive devices (Hliday & Hasan, 1976); and linking adverbials (Biber et al., 1999; Yin, 2022). Addition markers, compared with adversative, causal and sequential markers, account for the largest proportion of such devices in academic writing. It is therefore expected that student academic writing contains a large number of addition markers whose distribution and deployment is worthy of further exploration.

The aim of this paper is to explore first how adition markers are distributed across disciplines and genres in universty student writing. This willbe of interest to teachers of academic writing. It also engages with diffring views on disciplinary distribution, notably those from Hyland (2004, 2005) and Peacock (2010) who claim such transitions are used more in the discursive writing ofthe soft, non-science disciplines compared to Biber (Biber et al., 1999) and Cao and Hu (2014) who suggest they are used in the hard, quantitatiesciences. Having identified where addition markers are used in sucessul student writing, the second aim of this paper is to compare their deployment by Chinese and British student writers. This more qualitative analysis provides insights that can be readily applied by writing teachers.

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 is a critical review of literature on adition markers. Section 3 describes the research method and the data in the Han CH-EN corpus. Section 4 presents and discuses the findings of our study. The last section draws conclusions and provides pedagogical implications to inform practitioners and teachers of academic second language writing.

# 2. Previous studies on addition markers

This literature review takes a broad view of addition markers to include studies that draw on Hyland's metalinguistic transitions of addition, Halliday's conjunctions and discourse markers, and Biber's inking adverbial, in order to focus on the use of addition markers across text types (registers, genres and disciplines) and university student writing in English cross ifferent user groups (L1 Chinese and L1 English).

# 2.1. The use of addition markers across registers, genres and disciplines

Numerous studies have found adition markers to be more frequent than other markers, including those of contrast, cause, or sequence. This review of previous studies wil focus on research on the use of addition markers relevant to academic writing. In terms of registers, addition markers generall occur more frequently in writing than in speaking. Liu's (2008) study finds the use of additive linking adverbial as a whole in academic writing is over 2.5 times that in speaking (3420 vs 1334 per millon words). There are, however, some exceptions. For example, again is used over two times more in speaking than in writing (119.34 vs 49.5 per million words), although conversely sentence initial again occurs approximately three times more in academic writing than in speaking (31.56 vs11.03 per million words. Generall, however, Liu (2008 upports Biber et al. (1999) in suggesting that adition markers are more common in academic writing than speaking. Other studies take a more nuanced aproach to spoken vs written registers. For example. Yin (2016, p. 8) compared five registers and found diffrences in addition markers not only in frequency but also in which addition markers occurred most frequentl. For example, also was most frequent in written academic prose and written news, where and was most frequent in the spoken registers of academic lectures, broadcast news and conversation where it was used in diffrent positions and with different pragmatic functions. She also found that \*and as a linking adverbial in wrtten registers has to be in the initial position of a sentence, though its postions in spoken registers . are more flexible (Yin, 2022, p. 249). Thus although there were differences acros the five reisters there i also broad support for the spoken vs wrtten distinction, and again the importance of sentence initial markers is noted for written registers. We now turn to genre and discipline.

Peacock's 2010 study of linking adverbials found more than three times as many addition markers than Biber et al., 199. Peacock suggests this may be because he was examining research artice, where Biber's corpus of academic prose also included book extracts. Biber found 1000per million words compared to Peacock's 3758 for additive adverbials in non-science research articles and 3115 for science (Peacock, 2010, p. 26). In terms of the proportion of addition markers, Biber found they acounted for $1 4 \%$ of all linking adverbials, where Peacock found twice as many at $2 9 \%$ (with little variation between science and non-science). Both these findings suggest cear genre differences within published academic writig, whichalso suggests that student academic writing might be quite different again.

In terms of disciplines, the findings are inconclusive. Peacock (2010, p. 22) from his analysis of linking adverbials in research articles maintains that the non-sciences of Economics, Language & Linguistics, Management and Psychology employ significantly more addition markers than the ciences (Chemistry, Material Science, Computer Science, and Neuroscience). This supports Hyland (2004, 2005) who claims that transitions are used most frequently in the discursive writing of soft disciplines (Applied Linguistics, Public Administration and Business Studies). In stark contrast, Biber et al. (1999) claim that transitions are used most frequently in the technical writing f hard disciplines. This is supported by Cao and Hu's (2014) study that shows that transitions are used more often in more technical quantitative journal articles than qualitative ones. Gardner and Han (2018) investigated this in student writing and found that transitions of contrast were used more frequently in discursive writing genre, but the question about addition markers remains.

# 2.2. University student writing and educational context

Another important factor affecting the use of addition markers is theeducational context. We firt consider the inluence attributed to text books from different contexts. Hinkel's (2002) study of 1457 short universty essays found that L2 Chinese writing contains significantly more sentence level conjunctions or transitions (p. 142 f) than L1 English American writing (1.59 vs 0.64 Median Frequency Rates per esay) (p. 146). She atributed the problem for L2 writersto American composition textboos and style guides (pp. 144-145) and pointed out that transitions were usually listed without detailed explanation for their use and distribution in an academic text. A similar conclusion is drawn by Leedham and Cai (2013) who compare writing by Chinese and British students at UK universities, and although they do not isolate addition markers, they conclude that Chinese student writers use certain linking ad. verbials (including what's more) significantly more than their British counterparts, and argue that through their secondary school

English texts, Chinese students are primed \*to favour particular linking adverbial, to disregard issues of informality, and to prefer sentence-initial positioning (p. 374). A similar argument is made specificall for aditive markers by Kwan (2017) who builds on many earlier studies of Hong Kong student writing to describe textbook explanations as overly simplistic and lacking suficient attention to pragmatics and register.

Li and Wharton (2012) explored the use of metadiscourse by Chinese undergraduates studying in English in the UK and in China It was found that the UK-based writers used addition transitions approximately twice as frequentl as the China-based writers (80.1 vs. 43.9 per 10,000 words.In both cases there were more addition markers than other transitions, and transition marker was the most frequent type of metadiscourse. In a similar crosscontext study, Zhou and Peng (2015) compared Sino-British university writers texts with those from nine other non-Sino-British universities writer, (using the Spoken and Written English Corpus of Chinese Learners, WECCL 1.0), and found the non-Sino-British university students used aditions of what's more and (sentence-initial) more often in their writing. This supports Leedham and Cai's (2013) findings, and reminds us that although addition markers are frequent, it i also important to differentiate among addition transitions and their occurrence in different positions.

In terms of writing development, Zhou and Peng (2015) found that before taking academic writing courses, freshers in China employed three addition markers most ofen (and, further, in addition) while after one year's study, they used in addition, further and furthermore most frequently, which brought them in line with student writing from Britain. Zhou and Peng (2015, p. 153) regard this change in addition markers as "considerable progress'. This echoes Bax et al.'s (2019, pp. 93-94) finding that for L2 writers from intermedate to adanced level, there is an incrase in the us of fthmore and morover, whil the i lie change in the frequency of in addition, or also. They offr two explanations irt \*that the overall use of metadiscourse markers increases as leaners acquire (mainly basic) metadiscourse markers, but after reaching a certain level, the use of explicit metadiscourse markers decreases as they learn more sophisticated and subtle ways to express the organisation of a text without heavily depending on explicit markers" and second, higher level writers are etter able to lan what they write and therefore do not need to rely so much on simple markers such as and, \*unlike writer at lower levels who have a more aditive approach to text production' (p. 94). Both explanations are plausible accounts of quantitative patterns.

Thus research has shown that there are broad differences in the use of addition markers across spoken and written registers, and across educational contexts. It has also shown that much more could be learned from a cloer examination of genre and discipline. Our purpose i to first identify quantitative differences in a cosely matched corus of succesul universt student writig, and second to explore differences in use particularly where significant differences have been observed between Chinese and British writers.

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. The Han CH-EN corpus

The Han CH-EN corpus, as a subset of the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus, was constructedto examine the use of transition markers by Chinese and British university writers. The size of the corpus is 374,835 words, accounting for $5 . 8 \%$ of the BAWE corpus. The texts are university student asignments as a part of degree coursework from four English universities (Gardner and Nesi (2013). They are successul in having been awarded high marks (Merit or Distinction) by faculty in the disciplines. Since the corpus was built to conduct a contrastive study, the texts are from L1 Chinese (Mandarin or Cantonese) writers who did not study in the UK prior to university and L1 English writers who did study in the UK prior to university.

Texts in the Han CH-EN corpus are highly matched in terms of genre, discipline and level of study. Where possible, they are matched by module and topic. Table 1 shows an example of a pair of matched texts:

In total, there are 78 pairs of highly matched texts (156 texts) in the Han CH-EN corpus, which contains 374,835 words, with an average length of 2403 words per text. The texts are from 15 of 30) disciplines and 9 (of 13) genre families in the BAWE corpus. They are not evenly distributed, in that the majority are from Engineering, Food Science and Biology, which reflects the preferences of Chinese students in the UK (see Table 2). The most popular genres featured are Essay and Methodology Recount (54 and 4 texts), which reflects student writing more broadly. Because of the uneven distribution of the texts, we focus here on addition markers in the top five genres and top five disciplines as in Table 2. More details of the Han CH-EN corpus are found in Han (2018). More details of the genre families and disciplines are found in Gardner and Nesi (2013).

# 3.2. Data coding and analysis

The Han CH-EN corpus was uploaded to Sketch Engine, and tagged with the Penn Treebank tagset (Marcus et al., 1993). Corpus Query Language (CQL), $[ \mathrm { t } \mathbf { a } \mathbf { g } = \mathbf { \ddot { s } } \mathbf { S } \mathbf { E } \mathbf { N } \mathrm { T } ^ { \prime } ] [ \mathrm { t } \mathbf { a } \mathbf { g } = \mathbf { \ddot { s } } \mathbf { R } \mathbf { B } . \mathbf { \dot { * } } | \mathbf { C } \mathbf { C } | \mathrm { I N } ^ { \prime } ]$ , was used to identify all adverbs, conjunctions and prepositions in initial sentence position. This was repeated for items following a semi-colon (see Han and Gardner (2021), p. 4). Exceptionall, the item and was not considered following a semi-colon. This enables a focus on sentence initial and, which tends to be a linking adverbial (Yin,

2022, p. 249), and to ignore and where it joins noun phrases or clauses. Then we manually checked to ensure only those functioning as addition transitions remained and to weed out the items expressing discourse external relations (Halliday & Hasan, 1976, p. 241), following Hyland (2005, p. 38). Following Hyland's (2005, p. 50 definition of addition: \*adds elements t n argument," nine addition markers were identified as can be seen in Fig. 1 below.

Using Excel, we created a data base of.addition transitions and indicated their position as Sentence Initial (SIP) or Non-Sentence Initial (Non-SIP). An independent sample t-test in SPss was used to calculate any significant difference $\left( \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 5 \right)$ . The observed absolute frequencies () and observed relativ frequencies (per 10o words) are included in our comparisons. Further details of the procedure are discussed in Han (2018).

This study has two main purposes. The first purpose is to provide an overview of how additions are used acros different isciplines and genres in the Han CH-EN corpus. The second purpose is to examine in more detal the use of individual additions by Chinese and English writers. Specifically, there are four research questions regarding the use of addition markers:

1. Is there a difference in the frequency of addition markers between the texts of Chinese and English students?   
2. Are there differences between the texts of Chinese and English students in specific disciplines?   
3. Are there differences between the texts of Chinese and English students in specific genres?   
4. Are there any observable patterns for specific items and how might they be explained?

# 4. Findings and discussion

The statistical findings for the use of addition transitions are presented in 4.1, then 4.2 describes more qualitatively how certain addition items are used by Chinese and English writers, with examples in context. Section 4.3 explores further collocates f addition markers in the Han CH-EN corpus and in the BAWE corpus more generally.

# 4.1. Statistical findings

The quantitative findings sart with an overall comparison of the use of addition markers by Chinese L1 and English L1 students (RQ1). This is followed by a focus on discipline (RQ2), then genre (RQ3) and concludes with a statistical examination of individual markers (RQ4).

Fig. 1. Addition markers in the Han CH-EN corpus.

As seen in Table 3, the observed absolute frequency of additions by Chinese is considerably higher than English (219 vs. 153) Similarly, the relative frequency of additions istatistically significantly higher (1.427 vs. 0.633 per thousand words) as the -vale is less than 0.05.In other words, the Chines student writers use addition transitions significantly more often than their English counterparts.

How this significant dfference occurs is explored in the distribution of additions across isciplines and genres. Table 4 shows the relative frequencies of additions in the five disciplines with more than five texts in each sub-corpus. Generall, three disciplines have higher relative frequencies of additions by Chinese than English, i., Enginering, Food Science, and Biology. In contrast, two dis ciplines (i., Business, and Law) have lower relative frequencies of additions in the Han CH sub-corpus than in the Han EN sub-corpus. Significant difference occurred in the disciplines of Engineering and Food Science $( \mathtt { p } < 0 . 0 5 )$ . In other words, the Chinese writers used significantly more adition markers in Engineering and Food Science than thir English counterpart. ince the disciplines of Engi neering and Food Science belong to the Physical Sciences and Life Sciences, this finding supports Bibers and Cao and Hu's view that addition markers are more common in the sciences.

The reason for the different use of transitions may not be given by the isolated statistics from a disciplinary perspective, because the lisciplines of the sciences include a variety of genres with different preferences for the use of additions, as shown in our next table.

Table 5 shows the rlative frequencies of additions in five genre families with more than five texts in each sub-corpus. Allfive genre families show Chin writers hav highr rlative freuencie f addion markers than lish witers whileificant dfference is only found in Methodology Recounts $( \mathtt { p } < 0 . 0 5 )$ . Thus, the Chinese students use statistically significantly more addition markers than their English counterparts in Methodology Recounts (many of which are lab reports). This aso supports the views of Biber and Cao and Hu that addition markers are used more in technical/quantitative registers than in discursive writing. The greater use of additions in technical/quantitative registers seems to be one of the factors contributing to the results that Chinese students used more additions in the sciences (as Table 4 shows), as these disciplines tend to have technical/quantitative registers.

The reasonwhy th s  significant differce in the use f transitions in thetechncal/quantttierst is rlat to the use of specific transition markers as shown in Fig. 1. In the category of addition, nine items were identifie in the Han CH-EN corpus see Fig. 1). The Chinese students made use of two items (and, i ddtio) significantly more frequently than the English students. It seems that previous studies have not shown the same specific finding as ours, and this could not be a hypothesis that i launched because the result could not be obtained without the creation of our highly matched corpus. No significant differences were found for the use of other addition items by the two groups of students, and it can be noted that furthermore i used frequently by both Chinese and English writers.

# 4.2. Addition markers in specific contexts

Section 4.2 investigates how specific addition markers were used by the Chinese and English student writers. We focus on the use of markers with statistically significant differences, namely and in addition.

Sentence initil and is frequent in the writing of Chinese students, but it is also found much lessfrequently in the writing of English students:

(1) Thus, it is essential to provide a wide range of cuisines for tourists to choose, they include Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Indian, Italian, Indonesian, American, French and English etc. And there are also various types of catering services such as bar, cafe, night club, public house, take away, wine bar and tea room. (CH1CsHLTM-3085a)   
(2) Proteins range in molecular weight from 10,000 to about 1,000,o00 Da and can have highly complex structures. They are formed in a condensation reaction with amino acids. And a peptide bond is formed between the carbonyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the other to form a polypeptide. (EN2MRFs-6084a)

In extract (1), the Chinese student used and in sentence-initial position to add an argument about the various types of catering services to the receding argument on a wide range of cuisines, both of which exemplify ways of catering for diverse tourists. Likewise, in extract (2), the English student employed and in sentence-initial position to add an argument on the formation of a peptide bond. This argument was added to the preceding argument on the formation of proteins.

To better understand the extent of the distrbution of sentence initial and, further analysis revealed that ten of the 32 Chinese writers $( 3 1 . 3 \% )$ used the item and in sentence-initial position, compared to four of the 50 English writers $( 8 \% )$ . It occurred in 20 of the 78 Chinese texts $( 2 8 . 6 \% )$ , compared to four of the 78 English texts $( 5 . 1 \% )$ . As Yin's (2016) research suggests, it is more often found in spoken registers. This might reflect teaching in some contexts where writers are discouraged from starting a sentence with a conjunction such as and. The Merriam-Wester Dictionary of English Usage begins is entry on and with this statement: "Everybody agrees that its allright to begin a sentence with and, and nearly everybody admits to having been taught a some past time that the practice was wrong." Therefore, it sems that the British students are generally abiding by what they have ben taught, and Chinese writers willnot be able to predict which of their tutors are likely to also believe this rule'. Thus, although there is nothing grammatically wrong with beginning a sentence with and i is a practice that may not be approved and can be avoided. In extracts 1 and 2, initial and could be relaced by the adverbials aso, or in addition, and these are particularly appropriate where the second argument is a second or aterthought. lternatively, the paragraph could be reorganized to highlight the two equal parts of the message, as follows: 1A. Thus, it is essential tocater for toursts in two respects. There should be a range of cuisines, such as Chinese, Thai, Japanese, Indian, Italian, Indonesian, American, French and English. There should alsobe diffrent types of service, such as bars, cafe, night clubs, public houses, take aways, wine bars and tea rooms.

This requires the use of a shel noun such as respects' which is a useful feature of academic writing (Nesi & Moreton, 2012) that guides the reader to focus on the two arguments equally. Such strategies tend to strengthen the argument as in Extracts 3-5 from Chinese and English writers.

(3) The company had three main reasons to integrate the online business rather than spin it off. (CH4csBus-0291a)   
(4) In addition to the relationship between necessity and possibility discussed above, two further dimensions appear to be involved: certainty-uncertainty and objectivity-subjectivity. (EN4ESLIN-6038a)   
(5) Antioxidant capacity can be assessed by three different methods: oxygen radical absorbing capacity (ORAC) assay, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay (TEAC) and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) assay. (CH3LSFS-6008c)

Chinese writers also use in addition significantly more than British writers (0.202 vs. 0.047 per thousand words). As suggested above, in addition is used to add an extra or secondary argument. It also tends to occur towards the end of a paragraph.

(6) Secondly, plain carbon steel is selected as the material of the dis. Since carbon stee can .. In addition, the mechanical properties of carbon steel meet the distinct mechanical requirements in the structural applications. (CH3DsENG-0254i)   
(7) The ideas expressed above are important elements of fieldwork and should not be forgotten. However ... Furthermore it showcases that Nisa is not disempowered in her relationship with Shostak. She is not just answering questions, but is recalling her story. In addition, it reveals a touching bond between the researcher and the researched. The statement shows .. (EN4CRSOC-0422c)

In extract (6) from the Chinesestudent, the item in addition i used to add an argument that shows carbon steel has good property which was an additional reason why carbon steel was chosen as the disc material. This reason introduced by in addition was not developed with further details, and it is the last sentence in the paragraph. In addition occurs in the last or second las sentence of a paragraph for nearly half of its total occurrences $( 4 6 \% )$ by Chinese writers.

In extract (7), the English student used in addition to add an argument when analyzing the process how the researcher bridges the culture distance with the respondent. This argument inroduced by in addition occurs in the middle of the paragraph and after the preceding argument introduced by the addition marker furthermore. The position of in addition near the beginning or middle of a paragraph is the most common in the English students' texts, accounting for $8 6 \%$ of its total occurrences. To conclude, the Chinese students prferred to use in addtion at the end f a paragraph, while their English countrarts preferred to use it near the beginning or in the middleof a paragraph. One reason for this might be that i ddition is normall translated with the word \*ci wai' in Chinese.

While the word 5 ciwait incorporates the meaning of "dding another point', the word also implictly incorporates the meaning of "excluding or apart from other points'. Therefore, the Chinese students preference for the use of in addtion to introduce the final argument in a paragraph might be influenced by their first language I contrast, n addition in Englishi not necesarily used for  final argument, but more for an 'extra' piece of information.

The use of paragraph-initial in addition was another evident difference between the Chinese and English writers. More than a quarter of in addition occurred in paragraph-initial position in the Chinese students' writing, compared to $7 \%$ for English writers. For example,

(8) In addition, the conditions asociated with obesity are: Heart Disease, Diabetes, Cancer, OSsteoarthritis, Gallstones, Lipid dis orders, High blood pressure, Respiratory problems, Depression and Social discrimination. (CH1EsFs-6081k)

In extract (8), in addition is used by the Chinese writer in paragraph-initial position, in the second paragraph of the conclusion section. The preceding paragraph presented a summary on the rlation between obesity and junk food. In the second paragraph, the item in addition was used to add an argument that obesity may cause alot of health problems. This use of in addtion was the second most common in Chinese writers text.In contrast, the English writers rarely used it in the paragraph-initial position. For the position of in addition within a sentence, the Chinese and English writers, however, had the same preference, and both tended to use it in sentence-initial position as in Extracts 6-8.

Chinese writers also used in addition multiple times in the same paragraph, as in extract (9)

9) In addition, the concept has some limitations in explaining the extent of competition state .. In addition, the concept of Developmental State and Competition States are mutually exclusive. (CH4ESPOL-0257d)

Again this is not grammatically incorrect, but a more sophisticated writer would make the arguments clearer, and might simply omit in addition to allow the reader to focus on the arguments being made.

In extract (9) and more clearly in extract (10), the tendency to sring arguments introduced by an addition marker is evident. This stringing of arguments is seldom appropriate.

(10) In addition, DTI (2005:39) has drawn attention to the fact that  the courts have interpreted this legislation as applying to any industrial action . Further, there is no protection against dismissl for workers who take part in unofficial industrial ation... What's more, the common law does not provide a rule whereby those workers could obtain reinstatement in their employment. (CH4ESBUS-0081a)

From the perspective of academic writing, what's more (and last but not least) have been regarded as rather informal language (Leedham, 2015), more frequent in spoken registers (Yin, 2016). Again, the use of a shell noun would guide the reader and strengthen the argument. For instance, the paragraph in Extract 10 could begin Threefurther factors should be considered, or There are three further considerations or similar. The stringing of argument, each introduced with an adition marker is one of the reasons that there are more addition markers in Chinese student writing. In contrast English writers are able to count their arguments using other resources (e.g. 'second')

(11) The second requirement isfor the lowest possible ressure difference between the liquid and the steam . (EN2MRFs-6012j)

Interestingly, there was no significant difference in the use of furthermore between Chinese and British writers, and both used it i. similar ways in sentence initial position:

(12) Furthermore, judges especially Lord Steyn and other commentators have expressed their disagreement with the reference to such materials. (CH1CRLAW-0132a)   
(13) Furthermore behavioral scientist have questioned whether juries are fundamentall capable of distinguishing between truthful and lying witnesses and that generally"people are poor at judging credibility from demeanor". (EN3EsLAW-0411a)

In Extract 12, furthermore is used by the Chinese student to add one argument about the atitude of Lord Steyn and other commentators.In Extract 13, furthermore is used by the English student to add the atitude of the behavioral scientis.For both examples, furthermore is used in sentence-initial position, which was the most common position( $8 8 \%$ and $7 5 \%$ in the Han CH and Han EN subcorpora respectively).

As in extracts 12 and 13, the lack of punctuation afer the item in sentence-initial position, appeared rarely in the Han CH subcorpus, but it was common in the Han EN subcorpus ( $2 \%$ vs. $6 6 \%$ . This suggests that the Chinese students are fully aware of the use of punctuation after the transition marker furthermore, but it seemed acceptable for the English students to omit the comma after the transition marker. The reasons for this are not clear, but worth noting.

In addition to the use of furthermore in sentence-initial position, it also occurred to a lesser extent in sentence-medial position in both subcorpora ( $1 2 \%$ and $2 5 \%$ in the Han CH and Han EN respectively).

The position of furthermore in a paragraph was also found to be different between the Chinese and English students. More than half of the instances of furthermore $( 5 8 \% )$ occurred in the last two sentences of a paragraph in the Chinese students' writing, while only $3 5 \%$ occurred at that position in their English counterparts writing. It uggests that the Chinee students tend to use furthemore at the end of a paragraph, while the English students preferred to use it in the middle or at the beginning of a paragraph. The reason for the distinctive position of the use of furthemore is similar to that of in addition. In an English-Chinese dictionary, the item in ddition is normallytranslated with the word \*5 ci wat' in Chinese, which implictly incorporates the meaning of "excluding or apart from other points".

Again there is stringing of arguments with multiple ddition markers in the Chinese student writing, as in extract (14). This occurs more often in Chinese texts $( 2 4 \% )$ than in English texts $( 8 \% )$

(14) Moreover, job performance depends on individual perception, individual abilities and traits together with role perceptions Furthermore, differential performance determines rewards and produces variation in employe's expression of job satisfaction (Huczynski & Buchanan 2001). (CH4ESBUs-0264a)

There is also evidence of stringing with more informal transitions, as in (15).

15) What's more, the eating habit of adolescents changed a lot whil the high contain of sugar or high oil turns more popular and it will lead to future health care problems .. Furthermore, lack of physical activity contributes to obesity. (CH1EsFs-6081k)

Although dictionaries such as the Oxford Learner's Dictionary of Academic English (OLDAE) seem not to inform students about the difference f the use of these items, the further investigation of the frequencie of them in the Han CH-EN corpus might be helpful for students (see Fig. 2).

As shown in Fig. 2, the frequencies of these four items vary in the Chinese and English students writing. Generall, the Chinese students used sustantially more of thes items than the nglis tudents, except for th item further. mong the items with very similar meanings, the use of furthermore was the most frequent in the Han CH subcorpus, ollowed by the use of in addition, additionally and further.

Between in addition and additionll, both the Chinese and the English students preferred to use in addition. Although the two items have basically the same meaning, the Chinese students used in addition nearly four times as frequently as adtionall, and the English students used in addtion more than twice as frequently as addtionall. Likewise, although further and furthermore have the same meaning, the Chinese and English writers were overwhelmingly likely to use furthermore. It is likely that this is because furthermore cannot be confused with further or farther or non-transitions.

# 4.3. Collocates of addition markers

In the whole of the 6.5 million word BAWE corpus of sucessul student writing, the frequency of the item in addition was almost twice as high as additionally (75.45 vs 43.06 per million words), and the frequency of the item furthermore was around six times that of further (20.80 vs 5.06 per million words). Thus these tendencies observed in the Han CH-EN corpus are borne out for allsuccessul student writing.

The items in addition and furthermore were closely investigated in the BAWE corpus and the Han CH-EN corpus, in order to investigate if there are ways the two items are used diffrently. Log Dice and MI values are calculated to represent the strength of the word combination. The two measures provided by Sketch Engine are chosen because they play a prominent role in recent corpus-based studies (Gablasova et al., 2017). I general, higher values of the two measures indicate astronger statistical ssociation between two items. In addition was found to have high collocation with the item also (searching word range from 0 to 15) in both of the BAWE and Han CH-EN corpus.

Fig. 2. Frequencies of four items with similar meanings in the Han CH-EN corpus (per thousand words).

As Table 6 shows, in terms of both Log Dice and MI, in addition has similar high collocation value with also. Such collocations are also similar in the two corpora. For example,

(16) In addition, research has also focused on the development of a vaccine that would involve the activation of macrophages and recruitment of cytotoxic T cells to help kill the bacterium-infected macrophages (3). (EN2ExBIO-0009e) (17) In addition, EMS descendants also have the ability to produce intestine. (CH3EXBIO-0434a)

In Extract 16 from the BAWE corpus, alo as a collocate of in addition was used by the English student to add another focus of the research. In Extract 17 from the Han CH-EN corpus, similarl, also as a collocate of in addition was used by the Chinese student to introduce another productive ability of the EMS descendants. I is important to note here that the two addition markers are used to reinforce each other around one argument, not to string two different arguments together.

As for furthermore, the items argued and suggested were found to have high collocation values (searching word range from 0 to 15) in the BAWE and Han CH-EN corpora (see Table 7).

As Table 7 shows, in terms of Log Dice and MI, the items of argued and suggested have similar and high collocation values with the item furthrmore. The collocation of furthermore with argued and suggested occurred similarl i the two corpora as i Extracts 18-21.

(1oJ rur unermore, Il ds veen u gueu udt Il wds duI ued uldt dustu ue vep1ession. (EN1LoGA3-u3U41)

(19) Furthermore it can be argued that Shostak's research design itself was aligned with a feminist research perspective (EN4CRSOC-0422c)   
(20) Furthermore it has been suggested that the problem of ambush defenses had been exaggerated simply to secure the passage of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act. (EN3ESLAW-0411c)   
(21) Furthermore, it has also been sugested that the strict approach towards equitable compensation and the diferentiation that once existed between it and compensation in tort, has gradually been eroded'. (CH3EsLAW-0410a)

As these examples and the collocation data suggest, in addition tends to be used to add an example, where furthermore is more likely to be used to add a point to an argument. Despite their similarity of meaning, these differences in use should be noted.

# 5. Conclusions

This study has examined the additio transitions, a subcategory of transition markers as metadiscourse resources, and a comparison for the use of the adition items has ben conducted between Chinese and English student academic writing with the highly matched texts of the Han CH-EN corpus in terms of genre, discipline and level of study.

To sum up, for Chinese writers in the Han CH-EN corpus, we have found that addition markers are used more in the sciences of Engineering and Food cience than in the social sciences of Business and Law. They are also used more in the more quantitative writing of Methodology Recounts than in the iscursive writing of Essays. This supports the points made by Biber (Biber et al., 199) and Cao and Hu (2014). This is in contrast to Peacock (2010) and Hyland (2005) who found that addition markers are used more in the discursive writing of the non-sciences. Together these findings point to genre and disciplinary differences that are important for writing teachers.

A closer look at the data in Tables 4 and 5 reveals, however, that this pattern is reversed for L1 English writers, who use addition markers more in the on-sciences and more in the les tchnica writig of Eays and Critiques. The result for English writers in the Han CH-EN corpus thus support the arguments of Peacock and Hyland. The reasons for these differences between the two groups of writers in the Han CH-EN corpus are therefore explored.

First, it was found that the Chinese students use significantly more addition markers than their English counterpart (Table 2) and reasons for this were explored. Whil some studies have geneall investigated adition items (ee Biber et al., 199; Peacock, 2010), few of them have investigated the items in detail and made comparisons between Chinese and English students' writing. In our research, the addtion items were examined in detail and some striking feures of the itms were found. Generall, sucessful hinese students use statistically significantly more addition items than their English counterparts (3.016 vs. 1.821 per thousand words). As seen in Fig.1, sentence initial conjunction and was used significantly more frequently by the Chinese students than English students (0.348 vs. 0.027 per thousand words), as was the linking adverbial in addition (0.202 vs. 0.047 per thousand words). These were therefore investigated further.

First we can make the general claim that Chinese student writing exhibits more informal features. Thus items such as sentence initial and, besides, lst but not least, and what's more are typical of spoken English, but are also found in Chinese student writing. The informal feature in the hine student writing is alo shown in th items that co-ocur with the itm in addition It was found tha in addition i used with items lik last but not lest and what's morein Chinese but not English students writing, as in Extracts 10 and 2.

(22) Last but not lest, during the experiment, while we want totransport the dish, we cant touch it by our hands, if so the grease on our fingers may move onto the dish. $< / { \mathfrak { p } } { > } { < } { \mathfrak { p } } { > }$ What's more, result also depends on the time we heated it up. $< / { \mathfrak { p } } { \mathord { > } } { < } { \mathfrak { p } } { > } I n$ addition, although the amount of water in food determines its nutritive value and taste, in some cases it can be considered as an impurity. (CH1MRFS-60811)

The informal items of last but not least and what's more are also identified by previous studies, e.g. Le and Chen (2009) and Leedham (2015). A further informal feature, more common in spoken English, is the use of sentence initial and (Yin, 2016). This suggests that the hinese students may not have full awarenes of the formality of the language which have similar function tothe item in addition.

Our examination suggests that while Chinese writers could replace informal items with more formal addition markers, such as moreover and furthermore, this would not necessrily reduce the number of adition markers they use. So, in addition, they should also consider using more shell nouns to build stronger arguments and stop stringing points along with multiple addition markers.

A major difference noted is the way Chinese writers tend to string arguments along, each introduced by an addition marker (e.g. Extract 22), where a stronger argument could be made by using a shel noun, as in Extracts 3-5. As seen in these examples, some Chinese writers do make good use of shell nouns.

The final feature of in addition is that the Chinese students tended to use in additionto introduce the final argument in a paragraph, While the English students preferred to use it in the middl or at the beginning of a paragraph. Therefore, Chinese students hould not be affected by the Chinese equivalent word 5ci wai" in a vocabulary lit, but the larger context in authentic English texts should be taught.

Although we did not explore the reasons for the choice of transition with the students, this is something future research could usefully ursue Firs, it i worth ntin tht there were o siificant difference in the use f futhemore and morover, which suggests that these have been mastered by both Chinese and English students. The differences were most notable for and in addition. Based on our study, and ur rvi f t itee, thr possile expantions fr th diffenes ar gtd. irs, the fquent use of nd may be developmental - we know that and is in many ways the simplest of addition markers, and it may be that Chinese writers are using it while fousing on the aruments joined rather than the marker uset join them. Second, the frequent use of in ddtion may e influenced by its usual Chinese translation which includes the meaning and excluding all others'. This seems to be an item that teachers of English for Academic Purposes teachers should pay more atention to, not only in terms of its meaning, but also in terms of its use and senence postion. hidy, thediffernces may be a ul f chng as ther ave ugtd (e Hinke [2002], Leedham and Cai [2013] and Kwan [2017] who all point to the influence of textbooks).

Addition markers are used differently across genres and disciplines as shown in Tables 4 and 5 The evidence in this paper suggests that they are used more by British students in the discursive disciplines (. Business) and geres (e.g., Essays), although the reverse was true for the Chinese students (most notably for Engineering). More remarkable in our study was the geater use of adition markers by Chinese students in comparison with British students. This could be appropriately reduced through teaching guided by the following:

1) A useful distinction can be made between stringing points or arguments together and reinforcing an additional point.   
2) Where arguments are trung together, shell noun can be useully deployed to group arguments to prepare the reader for a number of points, and to generally strengthen the argument being made, as in Extracts 3-5.   
3) Where writers wish to emphasize one argument, a combination of addition markers can be used, as in Extracts 16 and 17 where initial in addition is followed by the subject of the sentence, then also occurs before the main verb.   
4) The colocation of furthermore with argue and suggest are noteworthy, as in Extracts 18-21. This is a second conventional way of reinforcing an additional point.   
5) Addition marker are used differently in written and spoken English It therefore is good practic to avoid markers such as besides, what's more, and sentence initial and in academic writing, as these are typically found in spoken English.

Finally, sentence initial adition markers can be followed by a comma. Chinese writers do this regularly, as in Extracts 12 and 21. This should be advice for Englishstudent writers who sometimes do include the comma (Extract 18), but do not do so regularly in the

Han CH-EN corpus (Extracts 19-20).
