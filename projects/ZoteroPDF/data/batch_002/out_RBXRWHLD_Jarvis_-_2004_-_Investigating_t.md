# Abstract

This paper begins by documenting the positive contribution of English as a Foreign\- Second Language (EFL\ESL) to computers in language learning and teaching and then proposes a general framework, applicable in a range of contexts, for investigating their pedagogical applications in the EFL\ESL classroom. The paper then reports on a study which examined the impact that computers are having on the delivery of EFL courses at British Universities. The findings of a national survey based on questionnaires are documented and quantitatively analysed. These established three kinds of information: what kinds of courses are run; which kinds of computer applications are being used; the attitudes of those responsible towards the current use of computers on these courses. These questions raise a number of issues primarily regarding the role of computers in English for Academic Purposes.

# 1. Introduction

English as a Foreign or Second Language (EFL or ESL) has played a significant role in the development of computers in language learning and teaching and much of this work is conducted in universities or Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). A glance at recent key publications in the field is testament of the contribution from the profession: Chapelle (2000), Warschauer and Kern (2000), Cameron (1999), Egbert and Hanson-Smith (1999) and Debski and Levy (1999). From a practical perspective, the numerous resource books offering suggestions for using computers in the language classroom have often been based on, and aimed at, EFL\ESL practitioners (Dudeney, 2000; Hardisty & Windeatt, 1989; Sharma, 1998; Sperling, 1998; Teeler & Gray, 2000; Tribble & Jones, 1997; Windeatt, Hardisty, & Eastment, 2000). Furthermore, the huge range of articles in both refereed and more practically orientated journals such as Language Learning and Technology http://llt.msu.edu, The Computer-Assisted Language Instruction Consortium Journal http://calico.org/calicopubs.html, and The Internet TESOL Journal http://iteslj.org/, are either entirely, or frequently, based in EFL\ESL contexts. It is little wonder that (Levy, 1997: p. 3) has commented that, ‘Arguably, within the field of computers in Education, especially within humanities computing, it is teachers in the area of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) and foreign languages more generally that have been in the vanguard.’ However, much of the empirical data to support Levy’s contention comes from feedback obtained from ‘experts’, primarily from British HEIs back in 1991 and these experts were not necessarily working in English for Academic Purposes (EAP). Over 10 years on and the field of computers has changed considerably in a number of obvious areas. Today language teachers in general, and EAP tutors in particular, who are not necessarily computer experts, are much more likely to be familiar with them outside the classroom in their daily lives. The vast majority of university-based practitioners will have access to networked computers at work, some will also have access from home. This change has been characterised by Warschauer and Healey (1998) as a move from an industrial age to an information age. What might this mean for the everyday classroom practice of today? Nearly 10 years ago, Davidson and Tomic (1994: p. 20) observed that ‘only instructors who use computers in their own work make dynamic use of them in the classroom’. More recently, Egbert, Paulus, and Nakamichi’s (2002) study suggests that previous experience may be a good predictor of CALL use. Given an information technology (IT) age where more nonexpert teachers, not to mention students, use computers outside the classroom, and given the probable link between this and what happens inside the classroom, it is perhaps an appropriate time to identify a range of specified computer-based materials (CBMs) and investigate the extent to which they are being used in the classroom.

# 2. Aim of study

Since this investigation is based on a UK context, for the purposes of convenience the term EFL not ESL is now used, as this simply reflects the dominance of this strand of English language teaching in the country. The study itself investigates the range of EFL courses available, the frequency with which computers are used on such courses, the types of CBMs used and the attitudes of the providers towards them. As we will see, the term EFL is used here in its broadest possible sense to include English for Specific Purposes (ESP) from which EAP stems. The study is specifically concerned with a classroom teaching context, and since the study shows EAP courses dominate, our discussions focus on issues of computers in EAP. Comparative studies between EAP providers in other countries would be an interesting area for further investigation.

It has been a long established contention that computers in EFL should be seen as a pedagogical not a technological innovation and it is this view of computers being used in the classroom to support the delivery of the syllabus, which is investigated here. Jones and Fortescue (1991: p. 101) comment that, ‘Work with computers is not an end in itself: the more it is integrated with normal classroom work, the more relevant it will be—and the more relevant the learner will perceive it to be.’ This, however, does not negate the more recent conception that computers today are more than just a pedagogical tool or a means to an end, but also, for many learners, an end in themselves, particularly in relation to the Internet. Research findings suggest that many learners using the Internet in EFL\ESL classrooms view it as developing life skills which happen to require the use of English (Warschauer & Kern, 2000). There is no contradiction here since one conception does not negate the validity of the other—in the specific case of EAP it is suggested quite the reverse, the conceptions are complementary. Nor does our perspective deny the importance of self-access contexts, but that is simply beyond the scope of this paper.

In order to conduct the investigation it was necessary to firstly quantify the types of EFL courses offered by British HEIs and to then provide a classification framework for the various CBMs that might be used to support the delivery of these courses.

# 3. Classification of courses

The role of EFL provisions at British HEIs can be traced to support courses for non-native speakers (NNS) in the 1960s, this eventually led to the notion of EAP in the early 1980s (Jordan, 2002). The recent arrival of this journal is testament to the increasing importance of EAP worldwide. The classification of courses used in this study is detailed in Fig. 1.

As can be seen, EFL is a general term covering three main course types and EAP is an umbrella term stemming from ESP and covering many courses. This study confirms that EAP courses remain the main remit for EFL providers at British HEIs (Appendix A courses 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 6a, 6b can all be classified EAP).

EAP courses, although by far the most important in this study, are only part of language provisions at UK HEIs. Providers have also developed a range of additional income-generating and self-financing courses, the most common being ‘general English’. With such a broad remit, both within EAP and beyond, it was not easy to classify EFL course provisions. The proposed classification framework (Fig. 1) which was adopted in the questionnaire attempts to recognise the diversity of provisions now on offer and was arrived at by visiting the World Wide Web (WWW) sites of a number of HEIs and noting the courses on offer. Broadly speaking, the various courses fitted into 10 main types (Appendix A course types 1–6c). Some HEIs appeared to offer various stand-alone ESP courses (5) whilst others clearly focused on English in Business (6c) as a specific example of ESP. A few HEIs appeared to offer ‘pick-and-mix’ type ESP courses which were not standalone or EIB, (6d). A few courses could not usefully fit into any of the classifications 1–6 hence 7a and 7b. (Although in fact only 7a was used in the returned questionnaires.) That so few HIE’s returned questionnaires with other course types does suggest that this classification of courses was reasonably comprehensive and reliable.

# 3.1. EAP and computers

Although there are important variations between EAP courses in terms of length, content and context, level, etc., traditionally the primary purposes of all such courses is to equip NNS with the language and study skills required for successful academic study. Computers are an increasingly important aspect in this. There is now a range of products available aimed at delivering EAP in a multimedia environment such as ‘Essential Academic Skills in English’ http://www. ease.ac.uk/ and ‘EXCEL at Academic English’ http://www.anglia.ac.uk/efl/ cdrom.html. And the case for integrating more generic programmes through language-based work into the EAP syllabus is compelling. In UK-based HEIs, as in many other parts of the world, computers now form a significant aspect of academic study whatever the discipline. Our students are expected to produce appropriately presented word-processed assignments, to contact tutors and classmates by email, to use Power Point in presentations, to search, evaluate and where necessary paraphrase and reference material from the WWW. This trend is on an international scale as a recent study clearly indicates: ‘ICT use, in terms of email, wordprocessing, Power Point, and the Web, has become standard as part of the teaching and learning process. . .’ (Collins & Wende, 2002: p. 7). If EAP is to adequately equip and support NNS both before and during their academic study, then computers are clearly an important part of that equation. EAP has only recently begun to address some of the challenges that this represents. An edited publication Howarth and Herington (2000) provides a comprehensive overview of the issues, whilst articles in various journals have also begun to address a number of specific areas. For the Internet, Jarvis (2001) and Nesi (1998); for multimedia materials Wu, Griffiths, Wisker, Waller, and Illes (2001); for the role of concordances and the vocabulary of EAP Thurston and Candlin (1998) and for word-processing Jarvis, (1997a). Despite an international trend towards increased use of computers at HEIs, to date there have been few extensive quantitative studies to show who is doing what with computers in languages, and those which have emerged have either narrowly focused on one area of EAP, such as pre-sessional courses (Jarvis, 1997b) or been broadly based across modern languages, rather than on EAP itself (Craven & Sinyor, 1998).

# 4. Study method

The Sunday Times University Guide for 2002 http://www.Sunday-times.ac.uk/ universityguide lists a total of 123 HEIs in the UK, but not all of these offer EFL courses. The study method adopted here was to send a paper-based questionnaire to $9 3 ~ { \mathrm { H E I s } }$ . These were selected from the British Association of Lecturers in English for Academic Purposes (BALEAP) web site: http://www.baleap.org.uk which lists a total of 74 institutional members. This organisation is the professional body of EAP providers in the UK HEI sector. However, in order to get as accurate a reflection of current practice as possible, the study included HEIs who were not members of BALEAP and for this the web addresses, documented in The Sunday Times University Guide, were used. A total of 19 HEIs were contacted from this source; the figure was arrived at by briefly visiting the WWW sites of each nonBALEAP member and doing a quick search for EFL courses within the institution’s website, where ‘hits’ were easily found (within several clicks); these institutions were then contacted.

# 4.1. The questionnaire

It was decided to send a paper-based questionnaire (Appendix A) to the Director of EFL for each HEI. It was thought that a paper-based questionnaire, together with an accompanying letter explaining the purpose and a stamped addressed envelope for replies, might prompt more responses in the first instance than the use of email. However, as the deadline for submissions approached, an email reminder (with the attached questionnaire) was sent to HEIs who had not returned their completed questionnaires by the requested date.

The first question asked whether the institution was a member of one (or both) of the two EFL professional bodies in the UK, BALEAP and/or the British Association of State English Language Teachers (BASELT), whose remit extends to the further education college sector, as well as HEIs. The second section of the questionnaire was designed to ascertain the types of courses being offered and the extent to which computers formed an aspect of their delivery. The questionnaire design of this section was potentially problematic in two respects. Firstly, as we have already noted, the range of EFL courses makes classification difficult. Secondly, there is very little in the literature which offers an explicit framework for investigating the full range computer applications when used as a pedagogical tool in the delivery of courses. We have mentioned the contribution from the computer resource publications, but these do not provide a conceptual whole which clearly illustrates how the various applications fit together to form a notion of the practice of computers in language learning and teaching. To do this, a framework needed to be established. The third section of the questionnaire takes the framework and seeks to discover what items are being used on specific course types. The final section surveys the attitudes of providers.

There are several limitations to this study and we have already stated that classifying courses and computer applications was problematic. HEIs using computers in the EFL classroom were more likely to respond to the questionnaire than those who were not; thus the national picture is only partially reflected. The huge amount of data generated in the third section of the questionnaire and a restriction to three possible responses to each statement are additional limitations and any follow-up work might usefully include more open-ended responses. Despite these limitations, it is felt that the data raise a number of EAP-related features and that these are of relevance beyond the national context of this investigation.

# 4.1.1. A framework for investing the practice of computers in teaching and learning

Fig. 2 provides a framework for understanding how the different uses of computers in the EFL classroom might form a conceptual whole. The framework takes a broad definition of computers in language learning and teaching to include language-specific as well as more generic IT programmes. There are four main areas which stem from computer applications in language teaching and learning. From these areas further sub-divisions can be made. Thus generic IT programmes have three main sub-divisions which can be considered of relevance to EFL. For foreign language programmes two main sub-divisions are proposed: authoring materials and off-the-shelf dedicated packages. Although in both cases these generally tend to be multimedia packages in that they incorporate text, audio and/or video, some HEIs may still use more traditional text-based programmes, but none was reported in this study. Concordances are the one identified exception to multimedia but this software is in any case different from other examples in this section in that it is a tool to explore language (Higgins, 1988). General authoring programmes such as Toolbook http://home.click2learn.com/en/toolbook/index.asp are, of course, frequently used to develop off-the-shelf dedicated packages but might also be used by practitioners to author their own material. Less computer-competent language teachers are more likely to use language-specific authoring programmes such as The Wida Software Authoring Suite http://www.wida.co.uk/frame.htm or Can8 http://www.can8.ca/ (although there was in fact little evidence of this). Multimedia ‘authentic’ CD ROM-based material (not specifically written for EFL learners) forms another component of the framework, the Encarta encyclopaedia used for project work is an example of this. In the case of the Internet, yet further subdivisions can be seen in the questionnaire itself, these include the use of email for language advising and/or for writing tasks and the use of live chat rooms. These sub-divisions are based on the classification framework proposed by Jarvis (2002). Finally, it is worth noting that dedicated EFL websites can, in many ways, be viewed as a newer and more recent form of authoring CALL, in that they allow the webmaster to generate and author exercises using an Internet-based programme such as Hot Potatoes http://web.uvic.ca/hrd/halfbaked/.

# 5. Results and analysis

A total of 40 questionnaires were returned from the 93 which were originally distributed. Of these, 38 were usable and 2 had to be disregarded because of inconsistencies between sections. The usable questionnaires thus represent a return of $4 0 . 8 6 \%$ . This sample size is well above the $10 { - } 3 3 \%$ average return rate as outlined by Sommer and Sommer (1991) and exceeds the $30 \%$ identified by Cohen and Manion (1994) as the minimum for useful statistical analysis. Twenty three of the returned questionnaires were members of BALEAP only, 7 were members of both BALEAP and BASELT, 2 were members of BASELT only and 6 were members of neither.

# 5.1. Courses offered and time spent on computers

Table 1 documents the percentage of HEIs offering each course and the percentage of classroom time allocated to using computers by those HEIs offering each course type. The raw data for this Table are presented in Appendix B.

The collated questionnaires indicated several other interesting facts, which cannot be included in the table. Twenty six percent (10) HEIs provide CBMs as part of timetabled input on only one or two EFL courses. Of these 10 institutions, 2 offer only one EFL course, but 7 offer five or more EFL courses but only integrate CBMs on one of these courses. These institutions, along with the $5 \%$ (2) institutions who provide no CBMs on any courses have clearly made a decision to confine computers to self-access or not use them at all.

The central importance of several types of EAP courses (2a, 3a, 6a, and 6b) is clearly indicated, even though EAP specifically at postgraduate level (2b and 3b) is much less common; postgraduate students will form a part of other EAP courses (6a and 6b). The move beyond EAP and the importance of more commercially orientated courses (1, 4, and to a much lesser extent 6c, 6d, and 7a) is also evident.

The data show that with the exceptions of 2a and 2b, the majority of classroom time spent on computers is less than $10 \%$ ; this would suggest that most practitioners are not technology-driven, in the sense of frequently using computers, but do nevertheless recognise a role for their regular use in the delivery of courses. However, with in-sessional EAP (6b) and credit-bearing EFL modules as part of an undergraduate or postgraduate degree (2a and 2b) a significant number of HEIs reported that computers form no part in the delivery of these courses. This is probably because, whilst most other courses are likely to involve a significant number of teaching hours per week, these courses, in contrast, tend to involve a much shorter amount of EFL teaching time, as students will be studying other academic subjects.

It is clear from the statistics that a significant minority of institutions do not include computers in the delivery of many of their courses, courses which are nevertheless widely delivered across HEIs, and are likely to include a number of EFL teaching hours per week. Thirty percent of students on general English courses (1) and $2 6 \%$ of students on Access pre-undergraduate foundation courses (3a) do not use computers in the EFL classroom. The ‘Other Comments’ section of the questionnaire offers three possible reasons for not including computers: the association of computers exclusively within a self-access domain, practical constraints, and for some HEIs a belief that computers as a pedagogical tool used in the delivery of courses do not have a place. The following examples from returned comments illustrate these three explanations:

You seem interested in computers inside the classroom. Inside is where there is real human contact, a buzz, jokes, etc., and it is the bit that costs most so students want a real teacher and IT should be marginal. Outside the classroom of course the sky is the limit.

Most staff think they are not a substitute for student–teacher interaction.

Students use computers a lot independently but we are not currently able to teach in a lab with $2 0 ~ \mathrm { P C s }$ and possibly do not want to enough to make that a must-have.

. .use is patchy partly because of limited computer facilities (2 rooms 18 PCs). . .   
This is chiefly a space problem. . .

Lessons are very short so even those who are committed to using computers may not use them in the delivery of their lessons. Also most ordinary classrooms are not adequately equipped.

# 5.2. Types of computer programmes used

Table 2 documents the percentage of respondents who indicated that each type of CBM is used for each EFL course type; these percentages were arrived at by converting the raw data from the relevant sections of the returned questionnaires. The total number of HIEs who indicated that a particular CBM type is used on a particular course type is indicated in brackets in the first row of Table 2 and is taken from Appendix B. The percentages were calculated by taking the total number of HEIs offering that particular course and dividing this by the number of HEIs indicating that a particular CBM type is used in the delivery of the course (Appendix C). For example, 27 HEIs (or $71 \%$ ) offer general English courses and of these 5 HEIs indicated that: $^ { \circ } 1 \ =$ Students use language learning web-based material produced in-house’, $5 / 2 7$ as a percentage thus equals $1 9 \%$ . In other words, $1 9 \%$ of general English courses at a British HEIs include web-based material produced in-house as part of the timetabled delivery of the course.

The final column of Table 2 illustrates how the types of CBMs used are spread across HEIs. This was collated by taking the number of institutions who indicated that they used this software at least once on at least one course (Appendix C last column); the percentages from the 38 returned questionnaires were then calculated. To illustrate, a total of 16 HEIs had put number one in at least one box on the second page of the questionnaire in order to indicate that: $^ { 6 } 1 = 1$ Students use language learning web-based material produced in-house’, $1 6 / 3 8$ thus shows that $42 \%$ of HEIs used this particular type of CBM on at least one of their EFL courses.

Table 2 is analysed primarily from the perspective of the CBMs on all courses; this is documented in the last column and gives an indication of a national trend. Discussion of data is necessarily selective due to limitation of space. However, such information might well serve as a basis for further more qualitative orientated investigation. Exceptionally, with the data concerning the use of the wordprocessor, our analysis considers comparisons between courses; the reasons for this will become apparent.

# 5.2.1. The Internet

The Internet (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7) has clearly come of age. The WWW is the most popular application of all CBM types, with material specifically dedicated to language learning being the most popular of all web-based activities. However, it is dedicated websites produced by others which are the most widely used application. With a total of $71 \%$ of HEIs using such sites for the delivery of at least one of their courses, it would seem that this aspect is by far the most significant in terms of the practice of computers in language learning and teaching. It is also an aspect of the Internet which, compared to others, probably requires least preparation on the part of the teacher. Given the importance of dedicated sites produced by others, further studies might usefully investigate the criteria used for selection and evaluation. With paper-based materials there is a long established tradition and a set of definable criteria to assist decision-makers (Cunningsworth, 1995; Ellis, 1997; Mc Donough & Shaw, 1993; Sheldon, 1988). The fact that no such criteria exists with web material and that ‘we are still a long way from any worldwide collaborative pooling of talent and time’ (Felix, 2001: p. 189) would seem to represent major challenges.

With the exception of various ESP courses (5) (where the ‘specific’ course element may well refer to computers) web material produced in-house has significantly lower usage than material produced by others. What reasons might account for this? The most obvious reason is the time it takes to produce material and perhaps this phenomenon is just as true for web-based material as it is for paperbased resource material. It is likely that most HEIs use course and resource books more frequently than material produced in-house and that this tendency to leave production to others, but to adapt accordingly, is probably a continuation of this trend with the WWW.

The role of the WWW in providing authentic material is clearly recognized by many HEIs but other aspects of the WWW are less prevalent. Given that so few institutions develop their own websites for language learning it is not surprising that even fewer involve students in designing web pages.

The other aspect of the Internet is, of course, email, and although not as widely used as the WWW, it too is still of major significance. In particular, student email writing tasks, first discussed over 12 years ago (Soh & Soon, 1991), appear to be well established practice and the newer notion of using email for language advising (Altshul, 2001) is beginning to have an impact. In contrast very few HEIs reported using chat rooms. The well publicised abuse of such rooms is undoubtedly one reason for this, but it would appear that even the more controlled versions (for example, schMOOze University http://schmooze.hunter.cuny.edu:8888/) do not feature widely.

It is highly probable that the notion referred to earlier (that what happens inside the classroom is reflected by how teachers use computers outside the classroom) is indeed a major factor here. Whereas busy teachers may well use the Internet in a variety of ways outside the classroom, it is unlikely that many spend much time developing their own web pages or in live chat rooms.

# 5.2.2. The wordprocessor

Second only to the Internet, the wordprocessor continues to play a major role on many courses. One might expect that its popularity is driven by issues of pedagogy and the integration of word-processed writing tasks into the writing syllabus. However, a comparative examination of what courses the wordprocessor is being used for suggests otherwise. Given the significance of EAP courses, and the well established link between the wordprocessor and the process approach to teaching writing (White & Arndt, 1991), add to this the importance of word-processed assignments in an academic environments and it is not surprising to see this included in the delivery of many EAP courses. And yet it is rather surprising to see that this pattern is not repeated on all EAP course types and that only $30 \%$ of students on Access pre-undergraduate foundation courses (3a) use the wordprocessor; this is significantly fewer than the $41 \%$ on general English courses who, arguably, have less immediate need to use the software on their courses. The inconsistent applications of the wordprocessor is the single best illustration from the data in Table 2 to suggest that there appears to be no direct correlation between course type and appropriateness of software used on the course.

# 5.2.3. Excel and Power Point

It is surprising to see the contrast between these two software applications. We can presume that Power Point is used to develop presentation speaking skills but one would have thought that the content of these presentations, and indeed the content of many word-processed projects, might have necessitated the use of Excel in the production of tables and graphs. This, of course, is particularly pertinent in an EAP context. It may well be that, as with aspects of the Internet, the reasons for this relate to the extent to which teachers use the software outside the classroom. We can hypothesise that of all the generic IT programmes illustrated here, most teachers are least likely to use Excel outside the classroom.

# 5.2.4. Foreign language and general authoring programmes

Off-the-shelf commercially produced software packages are provided by $50 \%$ of HEIs on at least one of their courses, but a detailed breakdown of the various courses suggests dedicated computer software is infrequently used in the classroom. The returned comments do, however, suggest that material of this type is made available for self-study. Only three HEIs reported authoring their own material either using a CALL authoring package or a non-language specific one. Of those three HEIs who do author their own material, Toolbook was mentioned by two institutions. The data suggest that authoring, perhaps once a key element of computers in EFL, has now been overshadowed by the Internet. The great promise and the huge excitement generated in the 1990s at the possibilities of authoring beyond text, in a multimedia environment, has not been fully realised. Ironically, it may be that the integration of text, graphics, audio and video material has contributed to this fact. The shift from easily produced text-based materials to more difficult to produce multimedia would seem to signify a decline in this type of authoring. However, it is also almost certainly the case that HEIs now see the WWW as a platform for delivering authoring material which is undoubtedly a more flexible and thus convenient delivery system. It is almost certainly no coincidence that the majority of web-authored material still remains text-based and in some respects this is now more similar to text-based authoring packages of the past than to the multimedia authoring packages of today. In other words, it would seem that where authoring is taking place, practitioners are changing the delivery medium but sticking to the familiarity of text-based content.

# 5.2.5. Concordances and CD ROMs for authentic material

It appears that the value of both concordances and CD ROMs for authentic material are not widely recognised. One might expect concordances to be used with students when working on word-processed texts but it would seem that this is simply not happening. Yet again, it is probably a case of practitioners opting to use programmes inside the classroom where use is made outside the classroom.

CD material is clearly less preferred for accessing authentic material than the WWW. Whereas a few years ago the difference between the two in the quality of audio and visual elements and the speed of delivery was substantial, despite the earlier observations about the continued text-based nature of web-material, this is slowly changing as the WWW catches up and this may well be one determining factor. The fact that web-material is free at the point of delivery and networked across campus, whereas commercially produced CD ROM packages have both costing and networking implications, is undoubtedly an additional contributory factor.

# 5.2.6. Summary

The findings documented in Table 2 indicate a mixed picture of the usage of CBMs on different course types and it would seem that generally speaking there is no direct correlation between course and software types. It is clear that computers form a significant part of the delivery on many courses, but appear to be underused on some. We have noted several illogical inconsistencies and this suggests that decisions about what to use are based on a pragmatic compromise between pedagogical value, knowledge of practitioners who are expected to deliver these courses and practical constraints such as rooms, timetables, etc. Decisions are made by providers within the identified constraints but the attitudes and opinions of decision-makers is one key aspect and it is to this, final element of the survey that we now turn.

# 5.3. Attitudes of providers

The 15 opinions that providers were asked to ‘agree’, ‘partially agree’ or ‘disagree’ with can be classified into three broad areas: the role of computers, the learners and their perceived expectations, and the institution and its staff. As with the other tables the data in Table 3 is presented in percentages out of the thirty-eight returned questionnaires.

# 5.3.1. The role of computers

Before the age of IT, or more specifically Internet age society, when computers in the language classroom were much more of a novelty and their use outside the classroom was far less widespread, it was a generally held assumption that computers were motivating. (Maley, 1989: p. 3), for example, asserts that, ‘No one who has observed the atmosphere of total absorption of a group of students using computers can doubt its motivational power.’ As only $8 \%$ agreed with this notion, it would seem that in today’s changed context this is no longer perceived to be the case. And yet with $84 \%$ acknowledging that the role of computers is more important today than 5 years ago, particularly in relation to the Internet this represents a major challenge when computers are used to supplement the delivery of courses in the classroom. Although, since its early days, it has always been recognised that work with computers needs to be made relevant to the delivery of the syllabus and the needs of the students, nevertheless the motivational power of computers added that extra attraction to using them. Without this it becomes even more pertinent than ever that computers in general, and the Internet in particular, is made relevant to the delivery of the syllabus. Computers can no longer be assumed to motivate our students since the majority have access to the technology outside the classroom and it is no longer a novelty inside the classroom. For EAP this surely means making computers relevant by making direct links to the academic context in which they are intended to be used.

# 5.3.2. The learners and their perceived expectations

With $9 5 \%$ agreeing that students expect the Internet to be made available outside the classroom, but only $1 1 \%$ reporting that they expect it to be used inside the classroom for teaching, it is probable that students are perceived as expecting to use the Internet for personal use and/or for language or academic specific studies but in a self-study context. This focus suggests that many EAP providers may not be adequately addressing the WWW and its applications in an academic environment.

Opinions about multimedia packages reflect their applications on the various courses and we have already discussed a number of the issues involved. There is a clear perception that many students do not expect this material to be made available inside the classroom; furthermore only $2 9 \%$ of respondents would agree that such materials were expected to be made available outside the classroom, for example, in a self-access context. If multimedia is to be a significant aspect of practice in the coming years, practitioners who use, and publishers who produce, such materials face major challenges in what is evidently a less than enthusiastic endorsement of this area.

Sixty eight percent agreed that most EFL students arrive at the university with some background in using computers, but very little background in using them for language studies and yet only $24 \%$ agreed that most EFL students have very little understanding of the appropriate use of computers in their academic studies at the university. It would seem from this, understandably perhaps, that providers are focused exclusively on computers for language work. And yet, given the high proportion of EAP courses, it is surprising to note the confidence that providers have in the perceived understanding that EFL students are competent in the use of computers in English in their academic studies. Providers of EAP might ask the following questions: Do students really know how to present a word-processed assignment which conforms to acceptable academic criteria? And have they gone through an appropriate process in order to produce a comprehensive final product? Do students really know how to access and evaluate relevant WWW sites? and how to paraphrase, quote and appropriately reference material from the WWW? Are students using email to contact tutors and departments, to submit work, get help from other university services, to post questions about their chosen academic subject on an appropriate bulletin board? Do students really use Power Point appropriately to focus on the content in an EAP presentation skills class? And does their use of Excel suggest that they are asking relevant questions to get relevant answers? In short, is the use of generic IT programmes as identified in Fig. 2 being used to develop ‘the underlying competence for successful study’ (Waters & Waters, 1992: p. 246) so crucial to EAP? And, as importantly, is all of this being achieved in English? If, as one suspects, that the answers to some or all of these questions is negative then this study focusing on EAP providers suggests that more considered thought needs to go into the practice of this aspect of computer applications in EAP.

# 5.3.3. The institution and its staff

The final section of the study discusses the attitudes of providers towards the institution and its staff. Much of the data for this is spread evenly between ‘agreement’, ‘partial agreement’ and ‘disagreement’ but there are still a few statistical trends worth highlighting. The most significant aspect from this section is probably the $42 \%$ who do not feel that their institution expects them to use computers in the delivery of their courses and the relatively small number $( 2 9 \% )$ who do. Given the importance of computers at HEIs, one suspects budgets are a reason for this; where computers are conceived as an aspect in the delivery—a pedagogical tool, rather than an alternative mode of delivery—costs clearly increase and HEIs are reluctant to take this on board. Davies (2002: p. 5) has made the very valid observation that, ‘the discrete use of computers in the classroom can undoubtedly enhance a language teacher’s performance, but educational administrators and business training managers often have a blinkered view of technology, perceiving it as a way of automating the learning process and saving money on staffing’. This perceived lack of top down pressure to integrate computers in the delivery of courses may well be a significant contributory factor in under-use on some courses. This suggests that the importance of adequately equipping NNS with appropriate computer skills is being overlooked by some HEIs. Cost factors are also evident in the data for hardware and staff development. It is, however, heartening to see that the attitudes of staff in this IT age are generally positive: few $( 1 9 \% )$ see computers as being the exclusive domain of the enthusiasts and only $21 \%$ reported little interest being shown by staff. It would seem that practitioners are keen to examine ways of using computers in the classroom, but as we have observed earlier, this is likely to be restricted to areas with which they are comfortable, and whether this fully meets all the needs of EAP students is questionable.

# 6. Conclusions

The data in this study suggest that computers are widely used by the vast majority of HEIs, but there appears to be some inconsistent use between courses delivered within an HEI. The extent to which EFL research insights, and the resource publications offering practical suggestions manifest themselves in classroom practice, is not always immediately obvious for some. We have identified a number of possible reasons for this including: practical constraints, lack of knowledge of programmes by practitioners, an association of computes exclusively with independent study and a reluctance by some to acknowledge any pedagogical advantage. If EAP is to adequately fulfil its remit for all its students in this IT age, then inconsistent provisions need to be addressed. Staff training is an on-going and seemingly never-ending issue, but practical suggestions for pooling existing skills of staff and students within a task-based EAP project class are beginning to emerge (Jarvis, 2003) however further work is needed in this area. Length of lessons are not always fixed in stone and if changes allow students access to computers in the classroom then they are worth taking a stance on. Investment in hardware is difficult to obtain in time of financial difficulty, but all HEIs have channels through which the case can be put and in putting the case, university authorities may need reminding of the generation of income surrounding the recruitment of many NNS!

Many HEIs are, however, making use of computers on a number of their courses and it is here where current use and potential trends can be identified. It is here too where a number of significant issues, particularly for EAP, arise. Certain aspects of the WWW dominate computer provisions, in particular websites dedicated to language learning followed by websites as a resource for authentic material. One of the challenges for future studies might be the developing of systematic criteria for evaluation of such sites. In contrast, other areas of appear to be significantly less important, multimedia programmes for example are not widely used and we have identified some of the possible issues and implications.

The biggest challenge at HEIs in the UK, as we have seen, is undoubtedly in relation to EAP. Such courses are by far the most dominant course types and this trend may well be true in many other countries. Course content is surely not solely about developing language and study skills but also about doing so in a manner which develops real life skills, and in EAP this means matching the use of the generic IT programmes to the needs and expectations of academic departments, thus fully equipping NNS. The data in Table 2 showing software usage on course type, and in Table 3 showing attitudes of providers, both suggest that this remit is not necessarily being fulfilled by all providers. There is an apparent mismatch between the needs of academic departments and the extent to which EAP is meeting them and this problem is compounded by a lack of comprehensive practical tasks and suggestions in order for it so to do.

Based on detailed study of one HEI, Studman-Badillo and Nesi (2000) found that there is an expectation of Internet use for study purposes but a misguided assumption that students did not need support. The practical resource publications are aimed at general English and not the needs of EAP. And yet with all other

EAP course components, such as reading, writing, listening, speaking and study skills, a wide range of skills-specific material is readily available (Glendinning & Holmstrom, 1992; Hamp-Lyons & Heasley, 1987; Lynch, 1983; Lynch & Anderson, 1992). We have already noted that the significance of computers in EAP has been discussed in the literature; however, to date there are no publications similar to those available for the various other EAP course components. The results of this study suggest that a publication of this type is long overdue and would be an undoubted asset to practitioners and their students. It would allow EAP course providers to focus more directly on the combined technology and language-skill needs of their students and thus constitute a significant advance in the practice of computers in the teaching and learning of EAP.

Number Computer based classes tend to be more motivating for students than other classes The role of computers in the delivery of EFL is more important today than it was 5 years   
ago. The internet increases the importance of computers in EFL teaching and learning. Multi-media CD ROM material has had an important impact in the delivery of EFL   
courses. Most EFL students expect networked computers to be available for use outside the   
classroom. Most EFL students expect multi-media CD ROM material to be available for use outside   
the classroom. Most EFL students expect networked computers to be used for teaching inside the   
classroom. Most EFL students expect multi-media CD ROM material to be used for teaching inside   
the classroom. Most EFL students arrive at the university with some background in using computers but   
very little background in using them for language studies. Most EFL students have very little understanding of the appropriate use of computers in   
their academic studies at the university.. My institution expects EFL providers to use computers in the delivery of our courses. The cost of hardware and software significantly hinders further development of   
computers in EFL teaching and learning.e Staff development provisions for computer training are currently insufficient. Computers in EFL tend to be the domain of a few enthusiasts to the exclusion of most   
EFL teachers in the university.. The majority of EFL staff show little interest in using computers in the delivery of their   
lessons.
