Chinese as a second language

As writing is a complex language-producing process dependent on the writing environment and medium, the comparability of computer-based (CB) and paper-based (PB) writing assessments has been studied extensively since the emergence of computer-based language writing assessment. This study investigated the differences in the writing product and process between CB and PB modes of writing assessment in Chinese as a second language, of which the character writing system is considered challenging for learners. The many-facet Rasch model (MFRM) was adopted to reveal the text quality differences. Keystrokes and handwriting trace data were utilized to unveil insights into the writing process. The results showed that Chinese L2 learners generated higher-quality texts with fewer character mistakes in the CB mode. They revised much more, paused shorter and less frequently between lower-level linguistic units in the CB mode. The quality of CB text is associated with revision behavior, whereas pause duration serves as a stronger predictor of PB text quality. The findings suggest that the act of handwriting Chinese characters makes the construct of PB distinct from the CB writing assessment in L2 Chinese. Thus, the setting of the assessment mode should consider the target language use and the test taker's characteristics.

# 1. Introduction

The testing mode is a crucial consideration in the development of language asessments, as i can alter the construct being measured and, consequently, the generalizability of test scores (Sadeghi & Douglas, 2023). With the advent of computer-mediated language assesment, the comparability between computer-based (CB) and paper-based (PB) test modes has become a subjec of inquiry from various angles (Chan et al., 2018; Kim et al., 2018). The primary aim was to establish evidence of equivalence between the modes Research, mainly conducted within the context of L2 English tests, has typicall shown non-significant differences in asesment scores between the two modes, while test takers with superior computer kills have an advantage in CB writing (Barkaouia & Knouzi, 2018) With the improved digital literacy and the catalyzation of the coviD-19 pandemic on the shift toward online language asessments, the initial concern about the negative effct of computer-based assessment has gradually disappeared. As posited by Jin and Yan (2017), computer proficiency should gradually be incorporated into the test construct and no longer be viewed as an irrelevant factor which may cause bias. The comparability ssue has since evolved into a broader discussion regarding the prevalence and potential

benefits of computer-based testing for larger populations.

Beyond the marginal distinctions in scores and textual characteristics, typing and handwriting proceses differ in their encoding of the logographic features of characters or words, especially in the context of Chinese, which employs a distinct writing system. Chinese characters are constructed with strokes forming an internal structure that is not always linear. On the other hand, the strokes do not corresponddirectly to ronunciation, and the graphics of characters do not reflect their pronunciation in the way that alphabetic words do (Sun, 2006: 101-113). Given the complexity of Chinese orthography and the ease of typing Chinese characters on computers the question arises regarding how to select the appropriate mode for Chinese L2 assessment. Up-to-date research is needed to investigate the mode effect in L2 Chinese, as previous studies demonstrated mixed results across Chinese proficiency levels (Liao, 2023; Zhang & Fu, 2015). In addition to comparing writing performance, the utilization of observational loging tools can yield insightful results on the writing proces (Alves et al., 2019; Barkaoui, 2019 iten & Van Waes, 2013; Lu, 2022; Revesz e l., 2017a, 2017b). This research strand analyzes fluency, pause, and revision behaviors extracted from trace data and examines their associations with writing style, language proficiency, and text quality. As an innovation in the research method, the present study leverages keystroke and hand writing logging techniques to shed light on the writing process in L2 Chinese. The study combines the views of writing product and process,exploring the potential of the writing processindicators and their orrelation with writing performance. It i an update on the comparabilit study on paper-based and computer-based L2 Chinese writing assessment in the changing era of technology.

# 2. Literature Review

# 2.1. Product-oriented comparison of L2 writing assessment in PB and CB mode

Research on the comparability of computer-based (CB) and paper-based (PB) writing tests has evolved since the inception of computer-based testing. Early research primarily centered on the equivalence of these two modes i terms of scores and text quality. Studies were conducted across diverse educational contexts (Goldberg et al. 2003; Horkay et al., 2006; Lam & Pennington, 1995; McDonald, 2002), with a particular focus on second language writing assessments (Chan et a., 2018; Kim et al., 2018; Weir t l., 2007).

Regarding performance scores, results have typically indicated equivalence or a slight advantage of the CB mode, although some studies reported superiority of the PB mode (Chen et al., 2011; Wolfe & Manolo, 205). Despite generally equivalent results various nuanced differences also emerged. For instance, in the case of Lee (2004), the analysis of writing samples revealed no signficant mean differences in holistc ratings between B and PB asessments. However, all analytic components of CB essays rceived significantly higher scores than their PB counterparts. Conversely, Chan et al. (2018) found no statistical differences in total scores, while they observed better performance in the PB mode's lexical resources dimension.

Overall in L2 English writing asessments the difference in writing score was not salient between the two modes, while the familiarity with the CB mode could enhance the writing performance. Lam and Pennington (1995) compared the writig performance of two groups of Hong Kong secondary students, one using pens and the other using word processors. The study revealed that inthe frst round, the computer group outperformed the pen group in al aspects except for content and organization. Subsequently, disregarding the aspect of content, the computer group consistently outscored their counterparts in other dimensions, highlighting the potential of the CB mode with increased familiarity. Jin and Yan's (2017) study further demonstrated the nuanced relationship between CB and PB modes through the interaction between computer familiarity and the testing mode effect. Groups with moderate to high computer familiarity scored higher in CB texts than in PB texts, whereas those with low computer familiarity scored lower inB writing. As such, previous research has highlighted the mediating role of computer familiarity and typing speed (Barkaoui, 2014; Barkaoui & Knouzi, 2018; Chan et al., 2018). The test takers' perceptions and preferences for CB and PB modes are also considered (Brunfaut et al., 2018) The students were generally inclined to take a CB assessment, which could enhance writing speed and accuracy.

With the widespread use of computers and the growth of online education and assessment, concerns regarding the fairness and accesibility of CB tests have diminished significantly (Jin & Yan, 2017). Typing skills have transitioned from an obstacle to an advantage in language asessments. Moreover, CB asessment offer flexibility in educational and academic settings by creating authentic task features that resemble real-world language use, surpassig the confines of a traditional paper-based writing test (Kim et al., 2018). CB language asessment is no longer merely a shift in the platform; it also emphasizes harnessing technological advantages to design new tests for various purposes.

# 2.2. Process-oriented comparison of L2 writing assessment in PB and CB mode

Writing is a multifaceted task that extends beyond the mere act of producing text It involves several stages, including planning, translating, and revising, as proposed by Flower and Hayes (1981) in their writing process model. To comprehensively asses writing competence it is necessary to consider not only the final wrtten product but also the intricacies of the text-producing process. Researchers have employed think-aloud protocols to delve into the cognitive processes involved in writing (Barkaoui, 2015, 2016; Chan et al., 2018). The main cognitive diferences between the modes are observed in planning and revision behaviors. In the PB mode, participants tend to be more careful in planning since revision is inconvenient and may lead to untidiness.

However, both concurrent and retrospective forms of the verbal protocol have limitations regarding naturalness or accuracy. Modern technology has provided valuable tols for data collction and exploration. These include keystroke and handwriting logging, which provide precise time-stamped rcords of the concurrent production roces (Alves et al, 2019; Leiten & Van Waes, 2013). These techniques enable the study of the behaviors taking place during the writing proces, mainly including fluency, pauses, and revisions.

Thus, writing behavior is the current way we operationalize the writing process.

The pauses indicate the difficulty of cognitive processing, which is reflected by the pause location and duration. Although under discussion, the 2-second threshold was usually adopted to catch the basic features of pausing behaviors in writing (Alves et al., 2007; Barkaoui, 2019; Lu, 2022; Wengelin, 2006). Given the variabilit i cognitive processes underlying pauses, the researchers employed a mixture model in keystroke analysis to capture the diverse distribution of pause durations, thereby identifying various pattens withn the data (Baaien et al., 2012). Categorizing pauses based on their location among linguistic units (e.g., words, clauses, sentences, paragraphs) can efectively associate pause duration and frequency with specific cognitive processes. Pauses between larger textual units, such as sentences and paragraphs, reflect higher-level evaluation and planning, while within-word and between-word pauses are often attributed to translation challenges (Barkaoui, 2019; Lu, 2022; Revesz et al., 2017b). Additionally, besides pauses between linguistic boundaries, Almond et al. (2012) also explored "before backspace pauses" and "before edit operation pauses to reflect the nature of pauses that are associated with revision behavior.

Revisions can be categorized based on content, linguistic level, and location within the text (Barkaoui, 2016). Pre-contextual revisions,occurring at the exact point of inscription, are more frequent in the online writig process than contextual revisions which occur elsewhere (Barkaoui, 2016). Regarding the linguisic level, keystroke logging studies have revealed that les proficient writers tend to make more lower-level revisions, while proficient writers engage in higher-level revisions (Barkaoui, 2016; Lu & Revesz, 2021) For L2 Chinese learners, revisions are more frequent at the pinyin level than at the character level (Lu, 2022).

Previous studies have examined the relationship between writing behaviors and various factors, including language proficiency, text qualit, typing skill, task complexity, and genre-the core inquiry centers on whether there is a pattern for high-performing writing behavior. The findings reveal that fluency is a robust predictor of language proficiency (Lu, 2022) and text quality (Revesz et al., 2017b). Less proficient writers and those with lower text quality tend to exhibit longer and more frequent pauses (Barkaoui, 2019; Lu, 202), indicating more cognitive load. As for the ink with revision behavior, Lu (2022) found that participants with higher proficiency made more revisions below the clause level. The results were mixed in this part, especiall for revision behavior, which is largely influenced by individual writing styles.

The above research primarily focused on computer-based (CB) writing with keystroke logging analysis. In contrast,studies con. cerning the paper-based (PB) writing proces are relativelyscarce, partl due to the challenges of capturing handwriting process data Alves et al. (2019) demonstrated the efectivenes of HandSpy, a tool designed for analyzing handwriting process data collected using smartpens and micro-dotted paper. This tol enables the design and implementation of rigorous experimental settings that are ecologically valid and highly effient. In their study, Alve t al. investigated the relationship between text quality and handwriting behaviors of second-grade children. They identified four key indicatorsnamely burst length, writing fluency, the percentage of long pauses (exceeding 2 s) between clauses, and the number of short pauses (ranging from $3 0 \mathrm { m } s$ to 2 s) per minute--that could distinguish between the high-quality and low-quality groups.

# 2.3. L2 Chinese writing in PB and CB modes

Different from alphabetic languages, Chinese has an independent writing system involving characters without direct pronunciation cues. The orthography of Chinese i comparatively complex. In L2 Chinese writing, significant distinctions arise between typewriting and handwriting in the mapping processes of phonology or orthography with semantics (Lyu et al., 2021). Writer have to produce the exact symbol in handwriting. In contrast, typewriting streamlines this process by transforming the production of Chinese characters into a spelling task using pinyin, and the recognition and selection of the characters. Thus, typewriting usually results in higher peed, quality, and quantity. I is hypothesized that the disparity between B and PB modes of writing asessment is more pronounced in L2 Chinese than in L2 English.

Previous studies on the testing mode effect on Chinese writing have generally proved that. In the comparatie study of the webased and paper-based test modes of the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi (HSK), a widely used Chinese proficiency test (Peng et al., 2021), Zhang and Fu (2015) found that CB mode scores exceeded PB mode scores for HSK bands 4 and 5, but th effect was les pronounce for HSK band 6. This was attributed to the fact that handwriting competence had reached a stable stage for HSK band 6 test takers. Liao (2023) studied low-lel L2 Chinese learners written text features in two modes. In the CB mode, learners produced longer texts with higher holistic scores but lower lexical and syntactic accuracy compared to the PB mode.

Given the increasing prevalence of the Internet and online communication, some results comparing writing scores generated by the two modes might have become obsolete, as the ubiquity of computer and people's increasing familiarity with it over time contribute to the advantage of typewriting. Liao (2023) study mainly dealt with low-level L2 Chinese learners, while the intermediate- and high-level learners were not involved. Despite numerous investigations into the comparative aspects of the CB and PB writing assessments, thee studies primarily address writing production and self-reorte cognitive procee, overlooking a systematic analysis of writing behaviors and their relationship with writing products. This gap in the literature highlights the need for an examination of writing behaviors in CB and PB modes to gain insights into real-time writing processes and enhance writing instruction (Chan, 2017). Therefore, this study aims to elucidate the differences between CB and PB writing in L2 Chinese from the perspectives of produt quality and writing behaviors. The research questions are as follows:

(1) To what extent does the text quality differ between paper-based and computer-based L2 Chinese writing assessments? (2) To what extent do pause and revision behaviors differ between paper-based and computer-based L2 Chinese writing assessments?

(3) To what extent do pause and revision behaviors correlate with each other and the text quality in the two modes of L2 Chinese writing assessment?

# 3. Method

# 3.1. Participants

This study recruited 30 L2 Chinese learners from 13 different nations. They are intenational graduate or undergraduate students studying at a university in Beijing, China. The participants were 25.07 years on average (Min $^ { - 1 9 }$ , Max $^ { - 3 1 }$ $\mathrm { S D } { = } 3 . 5 6$ ) and had been studying Chinese for an average of 5.56 years ( $\mathrm { S D } { = } 3 . 1 2 $ . They have achieved intermediate to high proficiency levels of L2 Chinese based on ther reported HSK band and score. Table 1illustrates that most participants ae females pursuing degres in Chinese-related majors.

Additionally, we clasified the participants into two study levels based on their enrolled program, HSK band, and years of Chinese learning. The high study level consisted of 15 graduate students studying Chinese for 4 to 11 years $\mathbf { ( M { = } 6 . 3 3 }$ , with 11 of them passing HSK band 6 and another 4 passing HSK band 5. The low study level comprised undergraduate students studying Chinese for 3to 7 years $\mathrm { ( M } { = } 4 . 5 )$ , among whom only 3 had passed HSK band 6, 10 had passed HSK band 5, and another 2 had passed HSK band 4.

# 3.2. Instruments

# 3.2.1. Computer familiarity, typing, and handwriting speed

The computer familiarity questionnaire used in this study is adapted from the instrument developed and validated by Weir et al. (2007), which includes four factors: affect, familiaity, computer usage, and availability and use outside of home. Our adapted questionnaire consists of four 5-point Likert-scale items on familiarity and computer usage, including familiarity with computer use and perceived typing skill in Chinese and other languages. The internal consistency of this questionnaire demonstrated good relability, with a Cronbach's a coefficient of 0.827.

To measure the participants typing and handwriting speed, they were tasked with copying a short discourse of suitable complexity for $3 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ We then calculated the number of characters produced per minute during this task. The typing speed assessment was conducted through the website https://dazi.kukuw.com.

# 3.2.2. Writing tasks

In this study, we utilized the HSK band 6 summary writing task, the coring reliability of which has bee investigated and confirmed by Huang et al. (2023). This task involves reading a narrative passage containing approximately 1000 characters for $1 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ and then independently summarizing the main content of the passage in approximately 400 characters within $3 5 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ . We selected this task because participants were familiar with it, as they either had taken the HSK band 6 or were preparing for it Aditionally, the integrated writing task with a source text reduced the topic efect and its potential bias to some extent (Gebril, 2009; Shin & wert, 2015). This task facilitated a complete text production proces with a contolled reading and composition phase, making it suitable for comparing handwriting and typewriting.

Two paralle prompts were selected for writig. The participants took the two different tasks under two modes. The participants were randomly assigned one from the four possibl task order combinations llustrated in Table 2, in order to counterbalance the potential practice or fatigue effects associated with task order as much as possible.

# 3.2.3. Keystroke logging-Translog $\boldsymbol { \mathit { I I } }$

Translog I i a keystroke logging program that records and analyzes individuals keystrokes while typing on a computer (Carl. 2012). This software tool enable researchers tocollct data on the writing process within a natural seting, rcording the timing and sequence of keystrokes. Analyzing thi data provides insights into the cognitie proceses ivolved in writig. Translog I was selected due to its excellent compatibility with Chinese input a crucial aspect of this study. The laptop computer used for CB writing was aDell Inspiron 5402, and the Microsoft pinyin input method was used because of its clean interface without much disturbance in the writing process.

# 3.2.4. Handwriting logging- Smartpen and HandSpy 3.0

HandSpy 3.0 is a tol for loging handwriting data, utilizing smart pens and microdotted paper (Alves et al., 2019. Smart pens are digital writing instruments equipped with an infrared camera pointed at the pen's nib, which has a sampling rate of $1 2 0 ~ \mathrm { H z }$ They incorporat procesing capacity and storage and employ replaceable ink tips. Micro-dotted paper i a special paper with a unique dot pattern printed on it, facilitating pen position tracking and handwriting data recording.

In our study, we utilized the Neo smartpen M1 to collect handwriting process data, processing it with the web-based HandSpy 3.0 data collector and analyzer (https://handspy.up.pt). This system allows us to extract writing traces and the tart and end time points of bursts and pauses after setting a threshold.

# 3.3. Data collection

Each participant completed two writing tasks, one in paper-based (PB) mode and the other in computer-based (CB) mode. The process took about $1 0 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ and each participant signed their consent and received a reward. The demonstrations of the task settings and data viewing interfaces are in Appendix II.

Before commencing the tasks, participants had to complete a questionnaire on basic demographic information, including ther gender, nation, major, duration of learning Chinese, and their obtained HsK band and score. Additionall, they completed the computer familiarity questionnaire and underwent assessments to gauge typing and handwriting speeds.

For the CB writing task, participants read the source text on the computer screen and composed their responses within the Translog II interface while the screen was recorded. The participants were not allowed to use the copy-and-paste function in editing. This logging process generated a.xml data file, which was subsequently analyzed.

During the PB writing task, participants read the text from a printed source and wrote down their responses on the microdotted paper using a Neo M1 smartpen. This approach emulated the natural handwriting process The smartpen transmitted the writing trace to the computer via Bluetooth, and the screen was recorded concurrently. Upon task completion, a.json file containing real-time writing data was generated for further analysis with HandSpy 3.0.

# 3.4. Data analysis

# 3.4.1. Text scoring

All essays were scored digitally, with handwritten essays transcribed into typed versions. During transcription, the character mistakes were corrected; thus, they were not considered in the rating scale. Character mistakes in both modes were counted as a separate dimension, encompassing non-character (exclusive to handwriting) and homophone (in both modes) types.

The scoring rubric contains three criteria: content, structure, and language (Appendix ); each was scored on a5-point scale. It was adapted based on Qi and Lio's (2022) rating of the same tas as in this study. We reformed the language dimension to make it more specific about paraphrasing or using the test taker's own words tostres the construct of the summary writing task based on Li and Wang (2021). Among the threeciteria, content was defined as accurately reproducing the original tory with its main plot. Structure referred to the organization of an essay with connections and proper word alloation in each part. Language was related to accuracy and complexity based on independent paraphrasing instead of remembering the source text.

The scoring process involved two raters, each with at least two years of experience in teaching and rating L2 Chinese essays. They learned and discussed the scoring rubrics and checked their consistency by rating six common essays before independently rating the others. The inter-rater reliability, assessed by Kendall's tau coefficient, was 0.837 ( $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 $ for the total score and 0.794, 0.818, and 0.733 for content, structure, and language subscores, respectively. The text scores were thus used as the measures of text quality.

# 3.4.2. Data coding for writing behavior

The data extracted from the software included pause durations for both handwriting and typing, the typing keystrokes, and the handwriting traces. The framework for pause and revision categorization primaril followed Lu (2022) and was adapted to include before-revision pauses, which are the pauses ending with a revision (backspacing or editing behavior). The texts' word boundaries were marked using corpus tools and manuall verified. We used the word parser tool from the website developed by the Instute of Applied Linguisics, Ministr of Education. The boundaries of clauses and sentences were identified by the first author and a Ph.D. student majoring in applied linguistics, and the different results were discussed to reach an agreement.

Table 3 lists the definition of each writing behavior indicator covered in the two modes and outlines the way we calulated fluency, pause, and revision frequency. The definitions for within-word and between-word pauses take into account the diferences in boundaries (pinyin, character, or stroke) in CB and PB modes. Within-word pauses usuall occurred between pinyin leters in the CB mode and strokes in the PB mode. The between-word boundary could be pinyin or character in the CB mode, but only character in the PB mode. In addition, the between-pinyin-and-Chinese-character pause is a pause type exclusive to the CB mode.

The first author and a research assistant labeled pauses and revisions after a familiarization and training session. The consistency was checked for the overlapped data of 3 participants, which showed an $8 7 \%$ agreement.

# 3.4.3. Statistical analysis

Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses of the writing behaviors and text scores were conducted using SPss 26.0. After scoring the written texts, the correlation among the thre criteria was examined by Pearson correlation coefficients. To address RQ1 regarding text quality, the many-facet Rasch measurement (MFRM) analysis was performed using FACErs 3.86.0 (Linacre, 1994, 2023). We conducted a 6-facet analysis including students, raters, writing modes, tasks, language study level, and three citeria of the text quality to compare different levels of the facet on the logit measure. Based on this 6-facet model, we analyzed bias interaction to examine the relationship among writing modes, tasks, language study level, and three criteria. Besides, three 2-facet analyses, each involving a rater and a pair of subscores, were conducted to compare differences in each criterion of the write texts in PB and CB modes.

In the analysis of writing behaviors, we explored the data to evaluate the normality of writing behavior indicators. Two measures of revision frequency in the PB mode were not included in the inferential analysis as they were absent in the data of 14 and 18 participants, respectively. Considering that some of the indicators deviate from the normal distribution, we chose non-parametric tests in the following steps, including the Wilcoxon paired test for comparing the writing processindicators in two modes for RQ2 and the Spearman correlation for exploring the correlative relationship among writing procesindicators and text quality fr RQ3. The strength of correlation was determined according to the guidelines proposed by Rea and Parker (1992)2

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Text quality

Descriptive statistics from Table 3 show that participants reported a high level of computer familiarity $( \mathbf { M } { = } 3 . 9 7$ $\scriptstyle \mathrm { S D = 0 . 6 2 }$ on a 5- point Likert scale. The participants' typing speed $\mathrm { \mathbf { M } } { = } 3 5 . 5 8$ characters/minute) was, on average, $2 8 \%$ faster than their handwriting speed $\mathrm { { M } } { = } 2 7 . 8 7$ characters/minute). Additionally, within similar writing durations, the text length in CB writing $\scriptstyle ( \mathbf { M } = 4 3 4 . 3 3$ $\mathrm { { \cal S D } } { = } 9 9 . 7 \ .$ ) was significantly $\begin{array} { r } { ( \mathbf { p } = \mathbf { 0 } . 0 0 1 } \end{array}$ ) longer than in PB writing $\scriptstyle ( \mathbf { M } = 3 6 4 . 8 3$ $\mathsf { S D } { = } 9 1 . 5$ ). Among the three criteria of text quality, the Pearson correlation coefficients revealed strong positive correlations between content and structure $( \mathbf { r } = 0 . 8 3 )$ , content and language $( \mathbf { r } = 0 . 8 0 )$ , and structure and language $( \mathbf { r } = 0 . 8 0 )$ among the three criteria of text quality $( \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ . In the CB mode, the criteria exhibited stronger correlations with each other (0.87, 0.82, 0.82) compared to the PB mode (0.82, 0.79, 0.77).

Concerning character mistakes (including homophones and non-character type mistakes) made in the two modes, data from Table 4 reveals that the total number of incorrect characters in the PB mode was much higher than in the CB mode. Since typewriting did not involve non-character mistakes, only homophone-type errors were present in both modes, displaying a relatively minor difference. Participants tended to make more non-character mistakes in the P mode, highlighting the challenge of handwriting Chinese characters for higher-level L2 learners.

Fig. 1 shows the distribution of 6 facets (students, raters, modes tasks, study levels, and criteria) on the logit measurement scale based on the MFRM analysis. The Infit valuesfor all facets fall within the acceptable range between 0.5 and 1.4, following the guidelines by Aryadoust et al. (2021) for multifaceted data. The two raters exhibited high consistency, showing littl rater fect (chi-squared $= 1 . 8$ $\mathrm { s i g } = 0 . 1 8 \AA$ . As shown in Table 5, the PB mode (logit ${ \bf \chi } _ { = 0 . 4 8 }$ ) was significantly more challenging than the CB mode (logit $= - 0 . 4 8 $ , with a chi-squared value of 32.8 and p value less than 0.001. Task 1 (logit ${ \bf : = } 0 . 3 3$ ) was more demanding than Task 2 (logit $= - 0 . 3 3$ . While the tasks displayed significantly different difficulties, the influence was less than that of the writing mode. And the language study level had the highest separation power, with the logit measure being 0.51 for the lower group and - 0.51 for the higher group, acording to Table 7. The bias interaction analysis did not yield any pairwise significant result. However, for the three-way interaction among writing mode, task, and criteria under the condition of thePB mode and Task 2, the content criterion was

0.88 logits easier than language (Table 6). When comparing subscores between writing modes (as detailed in Table 7), we observed that the dimensions of structure and language presented greater dificulty in the PB mode, while the content difficult remained consistent between the two modes.

To summarize, the high separation power of language study level and the fact that the writing modes and tasks did not interact with each ther supported the reliabilit of the experiment data. The tasks were significantly more diffilt (with higher logit measure in the facet) for the group with the lower study level, and the modeffet is consistent acos the two tasks. hus, the disparity in text length, character mistakes, and text score revealed a better performance in the CB L2 Chinese writing assessment.

# 4.2. Writing behaviors between different modes

Table 8 presents descriptive statistics for writing behavior indicators in both CB and PB writing modes, accompanied by paired comparison testresults. The descriptive statistics show a noticeable increase in mean pause duration as the linguistic unit expands in both writing modes. In the PB mode, the before-revision type of pause was the longest $\scriptstyle ( \mathbf { M } = 1 0 3 8 6 . 4 9$ $\mathrm { { S D } = 7 3 8 7 . 1 }$ , while in the CB mode, the before-revision pause duration $\scriptstyle ( \mathbf { M } = 6 0 9 8 . 2 1$ $\scriptstyle \mathtt { S D } = 2 6 8 8 . 4 2$ ) was comparable to the length of between-sentence pause $( \mathrm { M } { = } 6 2 2 7 . 3 6 $ $\mathrm { S D } { = } 3 3 8 9 . 1 1$ ) which were the longest on average. In the CB mode, the pause duration between pinyin and Chinese characters $\mathbf { M } { = } 3 2 0 8 . 8 5$ $S _ { Ḋ } \mathrm { Ḋ } { = } 9 4 9 . 6 6 Ḍ Ḍ$ ) fell between within-word $\mathrm { M } { = } 2 6 5 8 . 9 6$ ${ \bf S D } { = } 9 0 6 . 1 1 $ ) and between-word $\mathbf { M } { = } 4 1 1 5 . 6 6$ $\mathrm { S D } { = } 1 0 3 7 . 9 1$ ) types. The revision frequency decreased from small to large linguistic levels. Additionally, pre-contextual revisions occurred more frequently than contextual revisions in both modes.

In comparison, almost all writing behaviors exhibited significant differences between the two modes, except for the frequency of total pauses, between-clause pauses, between-sentence pauses, and the proportion of contextual revision, which exhibited no sensitivity to the writing mode. The CB mode demonstrated higher writing peed and shorter mean pause duration than the PB mode in all types that were examined for both modes. Another notable dfference was observed in the frequency of revision, which was markedy higher in the CB mode. The frequency of pauses exhibited a more nuanced difference. Pause frequencies at smallr linguistic levels (within-word and between-word) were higher in the PB mode, whereas frequencies at larger linguistic levels (between-clause and between-sentence) were comparable between the two modes. Aditionally, the frequency of before-revision pauses was notably highe in the CB mode, which was also associated with revision behavior.

# 4.3. Correlations among writing behaviors and text quality

Table 9 reveals thecorrlative rlationships between writing behaviors and text quality regarding content, structure, and language. AllPB subscores exhibited relatively strong positie correlations with fluency (r ranges from 0.58-0.6, sigificance at 0.001 level) and strong negative correlations with mean pause duration (r ranges from $- 0 . 6 2 \sim - 0 . 7 0$ $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 } \end{array}$ ). Also, all types of pause duration showed relatively strong negative correlations with the PB subscores except for the before-revision pause duration. Besides, negative correlation existed between PB subscores and some pause frequency indicators, including within-word pause frequency and before. revision pause frequency (r ranges from $- 0 . 4 2 \sim - 0 . 5 6$ $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 5$ , indicating relatively strong correlation) and contextual revision frequency (r ranges from $- 0 . 3 7 \sim - 0 . 4 5$ $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 5$ , indicating moderate to relatively strong correlation). On the other hand, all of the CB subscores showed positive correlations with typing speed (r ranges from 0.41-0.54, $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 5$ , indicating relatively strong correlation) and fluency (r ranges from 0.48-0.60, $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 1$ , indicating relatively strong correlation) and negative correlations with total pause frequency (r ranges from $- 0 . 3 7 \sim - 0 . 5 1$ $\mathtt { p } < 0 . 0 5$ , indicating moderate to relatively strong correlation), before-revision pause frequency (r ranges from $- 0 . 4 2 \sim - 0 . 6 0$ A $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 5$ , indicating relatively strong correlation), and almost all types of revision frequency except for contextual revisions (r ranges from $- 0 . 3 8 \mathrm { \sim } - 0 . 5 2$ $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 5$ , indicating moderate to relatively strong correlation), which was a contrast with the PB mode.

Note: The table combines three separate 2-facet analyses, which include one criterion at a time.

Tables 10 and 11 display the corrlative relationship among all the pause and revision behaviors. Due to space limit, the ful correlation matrix with significance can be found in Apendix II The patterns were imilar in CB and PB modes in that both fluency measures negatively correlated with most of the other indicators, especill strongly with pause frequency measures. The internal correlations within pause behaviors and revision behaviors were more frequent than the correlations between pause and revision.

Regarding the inter-correlations between pause and revision behaviors, the before-revision pause frequency had comparatively more interactions with the revision behaviors in both modes. Besides, the total pause frequency in the CB mode positively correlated with the word, below-clause, clause-and-above, and contextual revision frequencies, indicating these revisions may caused more pauses. The between-word pause frequency corrlated with the word and contextual revision frequency. For the PB mode, inter correlations between pause and revision behavior included the mean pause duration, which positively correlated with the frequency of total revision and contextual revision, and the contextual revision frequency also correlated with the betwen-clause, be twen-sentence, and before-revision pause duration. Also, pause frequency corrlated positively with pre-contextual revision frequency.

# 5. Discussion

# 5.1. The mode effect on L2 Chinese writing product and process

The comparison of text quality revealed that the intermediate to high level L2 Chinese learners produced longer and higher-quality texts in the CB mode. These texts exhibited better performance in structure and language quality, with fewer character mistakes, which aligns with the previous reearch supporting the facilitativeffcts of CB assessment i both L2 Chinee (Zhang & Fu, 2015 Lio, 2023) and L2 English (Lam & Pennington, 1995; Jin & Yan, 2017). Compute familiarity was not found to correlate with tex qualit, which is different from the previous results on English writig asessment (Jin & Yan, 2017; Chan et al., 2018). The difference may be because the participants computer ability was already beyond the threshold which could influence their adeptness at CB writing.

Our results partiall diverge from those reported by Liao (2023), where handwritten texts by relatively low-level Chinese learners exhibited fewer lexical and syntactic errors. In this study, the language subscore was higher in the CB mode. This divergence may be attributed to differences i learners proficiency levels, as the present study focused on undergraduate and graduate students with a proficiency level above HSK 5, which is intermediate to high level. For these learners, basic grammar and vocabulary pose minimal obstacles, while lexical richness and complexity are more citical challenge. The reults are alo slightl different from those f Zhang and Fu (2015), where no score difference was found between the PB and CB modes of HSK band 6. This study presents differences in CB and PB writing scores in HSK band 6. This could be explained by the growing familiarity with computers and typing, which facilitates Chinese learners performance in the CB mode, especially fter the prevalent online Chinese learning and communication during the pandemic.

The observed differences in orthographic representation and performance suggest that the CB and PB modes of the L2 Chinese writing task target distinct constructs. Involving Chinese character handwriting, the PB mode of writing test is more dificult for Chinese leaners who are not good at character writing, which can be evidenced by Yan and Lin (2023) findings on paper-based writing assessment, where the word and character errors had stronger discriminating power among test-takers from L1s that are orthographically different and economic-geopolitically distant from Chinese.

Besides comparing text quality, this study investigates the writing process in two modes. The differences were also prominent. Regarding pause behavior, which relects the writer's processing difficulty and cognitive load in retriving content and choosing lexical resources,ths study found that the PB mode generated longer pauses than the CB mode acrossall types, and thus, the fluency was lower in the PB mode. The result of pause frequency is more complex. For smaller lingustic unit, including within-word and between-word pause frequency, the participants paused more frequently inthe PB mode, pointing to the higher cognitive load in the translation process of generating the exact character. However, there were similarities in the between-clause and between-sentence pause frequencies in the two modes, because units like clause and sentence require conceptualization in both modes. Our comparison highlights that differences between the CB and PB modes are evident in pause length and frequency, particularly during the translation phase of the writing process.

A considerable gap lie in the revision behavior of the two modes, shown by the revision frequency and before-revision pause. The notable difference in revision behavior can be attributed to the convenience of revising in the CB mode, enabling writers to continue typing even when uncertain about word choices. In contrast, in the P mode, the revision takes more time and sacrifices tidiness and legibility. However, the proportion of contextual revision in the two modes was equal and relatively low. $2 5 \%$ in PB and $2 0 \%$ in CB). This result may also beattributed tothe participant's reluctance to make contextual reisions in the PB mode and the large number of pre-contextual revisions in the CB mode.

# 5.2. The L2 Chinese writing process and text quality

This study also conducted corlation analyses to explore the relationship between writing behaviors and text quality. In line with other studies, we found the CB subscores were positively correlated with typing speed and fluency, whil negatively corrlated with pause frequency and almost all types of revision frequency except for contextual reisions (Revesz et a., 2017b; Barkoui, 2019; Lu, 2022). While there were not many studies on the PB writing proces to compare with, the fluency and pause frequency (within-word and before-revision also correlated with the PB scores. Besides, the pause duration correlated most strongly with the PB scores, which differed from the CB mode. Overall in both modes, the pause duration and frequency, and revision frequency, negatively correlated with the text score, showing that both pause and revision reflect cognitive load or breakdown in text generation.

In the PB mode, the pause duration was more salient in the correlative relationship, while in the CB mode, it was the revision frequency that stod out. In the PB writing proces, generating characters and words caused the longer pause durations. The test takers had o first depict the character's shape in their minds. If they filed to recall how to writ the intended character, they returned to the lexical resource ank to search for a substitution (usul an easier one). For the CB mode, the reson that text scores correlated with many revision indicators lie in the typewriting styles of the test takers. We noticed from the typing proces that some participants kept typing non-stop because of the convenience of typing and revising in CB writing. However, they were not necessrily competent for the tasks. They took the try-out trategy when they were unsure how to pronounce a word to expres the meaning in their mind, resulting in a high frequency of pre-contextual and lower-level revisions.

In terms of the correlation among the behavior indicators, including pause and revision, we found strong correlations within every cluster of indicators: pause duration, pause frequency, and revision frequency. The inter-corrlation between pause duration and frequency was stronger in the CB than in the PB mode. Compared with Lu (2022) findings on corrlations among pause and revision measures separately, our results yield more significant correlations, which may be due to the difference between independent and summary writing tasks. Furthermore, the correlation between pause and revision was rare in both modes, except for the before-revision pause type, suggesting a weak link between pause and revision behaviors under the current lassification of writing process indicators.

# 6. Conclusion and implications

This study investigated the ifferences in product and process between the PB and CB writing modes of an L2 Chinese asssment utlizing the keystroke and handwriting logging techniques. From the perspective of the product, our findings sugest a clear advantage of the CB mode over the PB mode in terms of text quality among intermediate to high level and computer-competent participants. In analyzing the writing process, we examined various behaviors including fluency, pause duration, frequency, and revision frequency,comparing their manifestation in PB and CB modes and their impact on text qualit. Fluency can predict the text quality in both modes, and typing speed contributes to the CB text quality. The results reveal rather complex differences in the writing process. The PB mode was les fluent than the CB mode, with longer pauses and more frequent pauses at the lower linguistic level. At the same time, the CB writing process contained more revision-related behaviors. Too many revisions in the CB mode were linked to lower text quality.

Drawing from the findings, we propose several suggestions for L2 Chinese teaching and assessment. The diffrences in text quality and processin CB and PB modes of writing assessments indicate that the writing test equivalence cannot be guaranteed in L2 Chinese. As a result, the test's target-language use domain should be considered to strengthen the test's authenticity. Since intermediate to high level learners are more likely tostudy Chinese for academic and business purposes, CB writing is an appropriate test mode. Moreover, since the revision style can influenceB writig, writing instructions regarding how to valuate and edit the text would be  signficant competence. And the examination of writing processis easier to conduct with the recording tools. Intructions on typewritig should also be considered in Chinese language classooms, such as how to segment a sentence (by character, word, phrase, e.g.) to achieve higher efficiency using pinyin input.

Nevertheless it is important to acknowledge the limitations of this study. First, the ideification, clasification, and coding process of the writing behaviors could be improved. In this study, we did not take into account the revision type based on content, so the monitoring and improving nature of revision behavior needs inspection in future studies. The potential of automated parameter extraction with larger datasets could be explored to achieve a more accurate classfication of measures (Deane, 2014). lso, the text quality was based on human rating, while the objective complexity measures were not investigated. Furthermore, the handwriting processhould also be studied more closely with experimental designs (Wengelin et al., 2019 to delve deeper into the cognition and production of Chinese characters regarding its unique orthography to generate more knowledge on L2 Chinese instruction.
