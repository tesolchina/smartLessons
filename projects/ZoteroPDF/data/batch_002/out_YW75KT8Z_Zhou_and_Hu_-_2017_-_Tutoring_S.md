# 29. TUTORING SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNERS WITHIN THEIR ZONE OF PROXIMAL DEVELOPMENT

Recommendations for Changes in University Writing Center Pedagogy

# INTRODUCTION

Many English as a second language (ESL) writers at the tertiary level lack contextual, rhetorical, or lexicogrammatical knowledge to meet the criteria of good writing in the academia of English-speaking countries. To improve upon these areas, they often come to university writing centers (UWCs) to seek assistance and many focus on lexicogrammatical knowledge and skills (Blau, Hall, & Sparks, 2002; Harris, 1997; Harris & Silva, 1993; Moussu, 2013; Myers, 2003; Powers & Nelson, 1995).

This focus often conflicts with traditional, yet changing (Moussu, 2013), writing center pedagogy which utilizes the collaborative, non-directive approach with a focus on improving learners’ writing processes, or in North’s (1984) words “to produce better writers” (p. 438). In particular, tutors are encouraged to facilitate learning through the Socratic Method (posing open-ended or leading questions pertaining to student writing). Additionally, tutors are encouraged to focus on global errors (e.g., focus, logic, organization) rather than local errors (e.g., unclear expressions, morphological and syntactical errors) (Blau et al., 2002), also commonly referred to as higher-order versus lower-order concerns (Gillespie & Lerner, 2000; Severino, 2009) or rhetorical versus linguistic errors (Harris & Silva, 1993; Taylor, 2007). This methodology, primarily process approach-based, may be ideal for L1 learners who possess native linguistic awareness; however, it does not adequately address the needs of second language (L2) learners whose lexicogrammar knowledge often adversely affects semantic content in writing. Thus, local errors may affect cohesion and coherence, thereby leading to global concerns. As such, L2 writers’ needs are not adequately met through this methodology.

To address this disparity, we argue the need for providing linguistic feedback to L2 learners at various stages of their writing processes (e.g., planning, drafting, reviewing) based on relevant research in second language acquisition (SLA) and UWCs. We further recommend how such linguistic feedback should be provided to ESL writers through an innovative pedagogy that is based on sociocultural theory (SCT). This pedagogical approach allows the tutor to assess the ESL learner’s needs dynamically and to subsequently provide graduated and contingent assistance within the learner’s zone of proximal development (ZPD), which helps the learner achieve self-regulation or learner independence, a fundamental tenet of writing center philosophy.

Why Should Linguistic Feedback Be Provided To L2 Learners At Various Stages of Their Writing Processes?

When working with tutees, tutors are often instructed to address global concerns before local errors. Language errors are supposed to be left to the final stage of writing or the editing stage. This method may be infeasible if it is followed rigidly when working with ESL learners. Indeed, tutors should be encouraged to address linguistic or lexicogrammatical concerns in learners’ texts at the various stages of their writing processes when such needs arise.

This is because, first, the line between global and local matters is sometimes hard to draw (Blau et al., 2002; Harris & Silva, 1993). Blau et al. argued that when local errors are at the magnitude of obstructing meaning, they could become global concerns. For example, if the thesis statement of a student’s writing is incomprehensible due to its lexicogrammatical errors, the main idea of the essay will likely be unclear to the reader. Thus, certain language errors cannot be left to deal with until global concerns are addressed or until the final stages of writing, particularly those that interfere with a clear understanding of the main idea and major supporting points of a written text. Tutors could, according to Blau et al. “interweave the discussion of global and local concerns” (p. 35).

Second, language constraints for L2 writers are not limited to their final draft or the editing stage. They could result from any stages of their writing – drafting (also called transcribing), revising, or editing, and their transcribing process has been found to be “more laborious, less fluent, and less productive – perhaps reflecting a lack of lexical resources” (Harris & Silva, 1993, p. 668). Indeed, ESL learners’ language limitations during the writing process may not be as easily identified as errors in their texts because this process is largely social as well as private and independent, thereby limiting our understanding of their linguistic constraints during the process. Hence, the approach that emphasizes global concerns in early drafts and local errors in later or final drafts, which works well for native-speaker writers, may not work well for ESL writers.

Third, language is a resource for creating meanings. As such, it is practically infeasible to separate the discussion of form and meaning/content during one-to-one conferences. Hyland (2003) argued forcefully and succinctly against the separation of form and meaning:

The separation of form and content is largely an artificial one, of dubious theoretical value and impossible to maintain in practice… we only successfully articulate our meanings through the selection of appropriate forms. Language is a resource for making meanings, not something we turn to when we have worked out what we are going to say, and the two cannot be realistically separated when responding to writing (pp. 184–185).

This comment provides a solid basis against rigid adherence to the writing center’s method of addressing global concerns first and then local errors.

Fourth, because the understanding of what writing is has evolved, writing center practice and philosophy need to be in accordance with this current understanding. Writing used to be treated as simply text or composing, and it remains treated as such in some writing classrooms. The process approach flourished in the 1980s, and in the same decade, North (1984) published his oft-cited article titled “The Idea of a Writing Center.” In this article, North wrote that “writing is most usefully viewed as a process” (p. 438), which indicated the close link he drew between the process approach and the writing center philosophy or practice he advocated- “our job is to produce better writers, not better writing” (ibid). Regardless of the legitimacy of his goal of producing simply better writers, given that writing is no longer considered to be solely text or composing, rather, “writing is text, is composing, and is social construction” (Cumming, 1998, p. 61), North’s proposal needs modifications to reflect the current understanding of what writing is.

Indeed, is it not our job to facilitate learning and produce better writers step-bystep through guiding students to produce better writing or better texts each time they visit the writing center? If better texts are not produced, how can professors measure whether students have become better writers? In the end, in addition to becoming better writers, many students as well as their professors would also like to see better texts because as Jones (2001) argued, the notion of better writing ability is obscure and difficult to measure. At least to most professors, better texts can be an indication that their students have become better writers. Simply, subject matter professors may have no mechanism or see no need to measure their students’ writing ability by documenting their progress in the planning, writing, and reviewing stages of the writing processes. Instead of having professors assess the intangible writing ability as demonstrated by improved writing processes, it is likely more feasible to have them evaluate learners’ texts. Thus, the ultimate goal of improving writing processes remains to produce better texts.

It is not only necessary for tutors to provide feedback to the language of learners’ texts at various writing stages when such needs arise, as indicated by the foregoing discussion, it is also desirable to do so. This is because, based on sociocultural theory (SCT), one-to-one tutoring provides an ideal learning environment for developing language proficiency in L2 learners in addition to developing their writing skills. Then what changes should be made to the current writing center pedagogy, which is non-directive and global before local errors, in order to effectively address L2 learners’ language concerns?

In the rest of this chapter, we suggest an innovative pedagogical approach that is based on SCT and does not predetermine the directness of language feedback provided to learners. Rather, the tutor dynamically assesses the learner’s needs for direct (i.e., explicit) versus indirect (i.e., implicit) feedback and provides assistance accordingly based a regulatory scale that moves gradually from implicit to more explicit assistance. I will explicate how this approach can be used by looking at the nature of collaboration between the tutor and tutee in this process.

# An Innovative Pedagogical Approach to Providing Linguistic Feedback Based on Sociocultural Theory

Prior to this explication, I will review three concepts in SCT that are central to the discussion in the rest of the chapter: regulation, zone of proximal development (ZPD), and contingent and graduated assistance. These concepts conform to the writing center’s philosophy of developing learner independence and allow tutors the flexibility to move back and forth between direct and indirect assistance. In terms of regulation, SCT states that the primary goal of learning is to achieve selfregulation or accomplish a task with little or no external assistance. In order to develop self-regulation, learners usually move through three stages. The first stage is object-regulation; that is, children or individuals use objects to regulate a mental activity in order to complete a task (e.g., using blocks to aid counting). The second stage is other-regulation; in other words, individuals receive external support from more capable others to regulate mental activities. The third stage is self-regulation, and when individuals have reached this stage, they usually can accomplish tasks independently (Lantolf & Thorne, 2007).

The second key concept is ZPD, or in Vygotsky’s words, “the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem-solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem-solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers” (in Aljaafreh & Lantolf, 1994, p. 468). This concept provides a framework that brings together a wide array of elements in the process of learning, such as the learner, the teacher or the tutor, their resources, their goals, and their social, cultural, and historical backgrounds. More importantly, learners are able to reach their potential level in collaboration with more skilled others such as teachers or peers. In other words, other-regulation is an important stage prior to actual development or self-regulation.

This other-regulation within the framework of ZPD, from the perspective of SCT, is not random; rather, it is graduated and contingent. Graduation, according to Aljaafreh and Lantolf (1994), requires that the skilled other moves gradually from indirect or implicit, strategic assistance to more concrete, specific, direct and explicit assistance. The appropriate level of assistance (either implicit or explicit) is determined by the response patterns of the learner in a joint, dialogic activity. Contingency entails that assistance be provided when required and withdrawn when the learner demonstrates signs of self-regulation or the ability to complete a task independently.

The ZPD provides a framework in which the more experienced interlocutor could negotiate orally with the learner the appropriate level of assistance needed.

Collaborative dialogue is a hallmark of writing center tutoring, and as such, theoretically speaking and also as evidenced by recent research (e.g., Aljaafreh & Lantolf, 1994; Nassaji & Swain, 2000), one-to-one tutoring in the ZPD facilitates individualized learning and develops linguistic proficiency in learners. This framework is effective and innovative because it affords the tutor the flexibility to provide both implicit and explicit feedback based on the needs of the learner and the tutor’s ongoing assessment of them, not simply the tutor’s procedural beliefs. When the assistance is graduated and contingent, it helps the learner to reach his or her full potential, and therefore self-regulation can be attained. To illustrate how self-regulation can be achieved in the ZPD, we use Figure 1 (based on the regulatory scale from Aljaafreh & Lantolf) to demonstrate how a ZPD could be efficiently negotiated between the tutor and the tutee by the tutor’s providing contingent, implicit to gradually more explicit assistance.

The following dialogues illustrate the flexibility of applying the above steps in a typical tutoring session. In the first example, the dialogic interaction results in tutee self-regulation with minimal explicit instruction.

# Example 1

1. T (utor): Please read the second sentence in this paragraph.   
2. S (tudent): Okay.   
3. T: Is there anything wrong with this sentence?   
4. S: The spelling of pedogogical?   
5. T: How should it be spelled?   
6. S: Pedagogical?   
7. T: Correct, but there are some other problems that we agreed to focus on.   
8. S: Punctuation?   
9. T: Your punctuation is correct.   
10. S: An needs to be a?   
11. T: You have the correct article there.   
12. S: I’m really having trouble finding this error.   
13. T: Look at this phrase here (pointing to the problematic text).   
14. S: Okay. Hmmm, have utilize?   
15. T: Yes.   
16. S: That doesn’t sound right.   
17. T: What’s wrong with it?   
18. S: The tense isn’t right.   
19. T: How so?   
20. S: I think that have been utilizing sounds better. Does it?   
21. T: What do you think?   
22. S: It’s right.   
23. T: That is correct. Let’s continue with the remaining text.

However, if self-regulation is not attained with tutor assistance at the first stage (i.e., locating an error), the tutor has the flexibility to provide more explicit assistance, as demonstrated in the next example (continued from Line 15 in Example 1).

# Example 2

1. S: Have utilize sounds good to me.   
2. T: There is something wrong with the verb tense here.   
3. S: I think have utilizing sounds better. Does it?   
4. T: Not really. You can’t use the word have with the base form of a verb or the present participle of the verb.   
5. S: That’s right. Sorry! I forgot. I think I can use have utilized or have been utilizing. Have been utilizing seems better.   
6. T: You got it. Excellent!

In the second example, the tutee has attained self-regulation with assistance at Stage 2—identifying the error. In other words, right after the tutor identifies the error, the tutee is able to correct the error by himself or herself. In practice, some students may need more explicit assistance in correcting the error, as shown in the following example (continued from Line 4 in Example 2).

# Example 3

1. S: Hmmm? You mean I should use have utilized? Can I use have utilized?

2. T: Well, you actually need the present perfect progressive form of the verb. You need something that states the teachers have used it in the past and continue to do so.   
3. S: I don’t know what that means exactly.   
4. T: You should say, The teachers have been utilizing a pedagogical approach that facilitates learning in an EFL setting.   
5. S: Oh. Why is have been utilizing better than have utilized?   
6. T: Have been utilizing is appropriate here because the teachers have and continue to use the same pedagogy. With have utilized, you are not sure whether the teachers are continuing to do that.   
7. S: I see.   
8. T: Can you locate a similar example in your paper?   
9. S: I should have used have been here because the students have and continue to demonstrate a lack of comprehension.   
10. T: Good. Let’s continue with the remaining text.

In the third example, the dialogic interaction may not have resulted in tutee self-regulation, even after graduated and contingent implicit to explicit instruction. Therefore, the tutor provides explicit explanations and examples of correct usage in an effort to facilitate learning.

The above vignettes demonstrate an ideal environment that offers the flexibility to apply graduated and contingent assistance, which can be either implicit or explicit based on the tutee’s ZPD, to facilitate self-regulation. Problematic linguistic features are assessed by the tutor and the tutee is afforded the opportunity to self-regulate. When self-regulation does not occur at the beginning of the discussion of an error, the tutor utilizes a more explicit dialogic pedagogy. This mediated and progressively scaffolded interaction provides a means for the student to learn and thus potentially achieve self-regulation, which is different from the traditional writing center pedagogy that predetermines the directness or non-directness of feedback.

# CONCLUSION

In conclusion, given the unique nature of second language writers and their writing, university writing centers must make changes to their tutoring methods – which may have worked well with native English-speaking students – and address ESL students’ learning needs in the areas of both writing and language development.

As discussed previously, the benefits of the ideal learning environment offered by the UWC may not be fully realized if writing centers fail to modify their pedagogical approach to suit L2 students’ needs. The incongruence between existing UWC pedagogy and the clients they serve can be rectified by implementing the above pedagogical approach that conform to current SLA theory. In particular, adopting a ZPD-centered approach throughout the tutoring session is paramount to student internalization of other-regulation and achieve self-regulation. Graduated and contingent assistance is the means to accomplish this end, which is learner independence—the primary goal of university writing center.
