# Abstract

In New Zealand, as in other countries, increasing numbers of students are learning English through immersion in the mainstream curriculum. These students are reliant on their teachers’ planning for language form in their content teaching. In addition, there are many native speaker students whose learning difficulties are linguistic in origin and require a language-oriented pedagogy in all curriculum areas. Despite the many guidelines for such planning, there are few accounts documenting the ways in which these have been used by secondary content teachers. Drawing on principles from research in instructed second language learning is one way to plan more specifically for student needs. This paper describes the ways in which a pair of secondary content teachers used principles in an action research project to focus on form when planning a task-based lesson sequence. The teachers’ uptake of the theoretical constructs introduced in their TESOL teacher education programme is examined through the account of the lesson sequence they planned for their mainstream social studies classes. Factors which influenced their uptake of particular principles to guide planning are discussed as well as implications for the teacher education programme.

# 1. Introduction

This section examines the need for form in secondary school curriculum planning and theoretical input for such an approach. Many teenage migrant students learn English through participating in the mainstream curriculum. These students are reliant on their teachers’ planning for a focus on language as well as content in all subject areas including science, mathematics and social studies. There is extensive theoretical input from second language research that teachers might draw on for such planning (Davison and Williams, 2001; Met,

1994; Snow et al.,1989; Stoller, 2004). However, there are few descriptive accounts detailing the ways in which this input has been used by secondary content teachers to plan for students’ language and content needs. Immersion in a language is often insufficient for students to meet the increasing demands for written expression in their subjects as they advance through secondary school. Pica (2005) observed when considering data from a wide range of content-based classrooms where the target language was English that students’ language production was ‘‘fluent, but linguistically inaccurate” (p. 343); attention in the class was directed to meaning rather than form.

Many secondary students, not just new learners of English, need informed language focused planning. Each of the secondary learning areas has its own language (Bullock Committee, 1975; Vollmer, 2006) and educational systems are challenged to develop language-oriented pedagogy that benefits native speaker as well as non native speaker students. There is renewed interest in earlier work in language across the curriculum issues which guided teachers to focus on the reading and writing demands in their subject areas (for example, Davies and Greene, 1984; Lunzer and Gardner, 1979; Morris and Stewart-Dore, 1984 and the Council of Europe’s current project on Languages of Education).1 The New Zealand national curriculum, for instance, argues that each teacher needs to provide specific guidance with the specialist vocabulary, the reading demands, and appropriate ways of conveying knowledge in each subject area (Ministry of Education, 2007). In addition, the curriculum notes that English language learners will ‘‘need explicit and extensive teaching of English vocabulary, word forms, sentence and text structures, and language uses” (Ministry of Education, p. 16). Some would contend that a focus on language form is too narrow. Schleppegrell (2004, p. 70) maintains that ‘‘Focus-on-form approaches are typically not informed by a theory of language that is discourse and meaning based and instead view language acquisition as the accumulation of a set of structures and rules”. This paper uses and extends the view of form proposed by Ellis et al. (2002) which incorporates phonological, graphological, lexical, and grammatical form to include discoursal aspects of language. This focus beyond the level of the sentence to text structure is critical for the language demands of academic writing.

Teachers need to co-ordinate theoretical input from multiple sources when planning for the integration of language form with secondary content. Sardo Brown (1993, p. 63) defines teacher planning as ‘‘the instructional decisions made prior to the execution of plans during teaching”. In making these decisions, Kaufman and Crandall (2005) contend that when teachers are planning for English language learners in their mainstream classes they need to draw on not only their pedagogical content knowledge but also on three domains of theoretical input regarding language:

(1) knowledge about language, (2) knowledge about language pedagogy, (3) knowledge about second language acquisition.

This paper focuses primarily on the third domain and examines the ways in which teachers draw on their knowledge of second language acquisition to distil principles that provide a link between a language and content needs analysis and the subsequent design of a unit of work. Principles in this context are defined as ‘‘general statements that guide pedagogical action and are seen as comprising a teacher’s explicit theory of integrating language and content” (Gray, 2006, p. 130). These principles can be used as provisional rather than prescriptive specifications as teachers construct their practice for and with their students in specific contexts (Ellis, 1997a, 2000, 2005). Ellis (2005), for instance, proposed a set of principles to guide instructed language learning, Nation (1993, 1996a, 2007) another set to guide course design and Franken (2005) another to guide effective literacy practices for English language learners.

# 2. Teachers’ instructional decision making in planning

In one of the few accounts describing instructional decisions that a teacher makes when planning for the integration of language and content, Fisher (1996) outlines the English language and social studies objectives she devised for a year-long bridging course for international school students in Japan. Fisher identified specific needs that resonate with those of many immersed in the mainstream. Students are communicatively fluent in the target language but do not have the linguistic resources to meet the academic language demands, particularly of writing. Fisher drew on the strategy approach of Chamot and O’Malley (1987), as one of her sources of theoretical input. Other accounts of language and content planning relate to well documented partnership planning in Australia, where ESOL teachers work with content teachers to bring a language focus to their planning (Arkoudis, 2003; Davison, 2001). This research highlights the tensions between the disciplines of language and content and the superior positioning of the subject specialist. The ESOL teacher is often reduced to the partner who offers many different strategies or activities to create language learning opportunities but is not in a position to give clear linguistic direction to the planning. Conversely, research from Canada (Mohan and Slater, 2005) highlights the productivity of shared planning when ESOL and mainstream teachers are guided by the same theoretical input and conceptual tools.

# 2.1. Factors affecting teachers’ instructional decision making

None of these accounts has considered factors that might influence teacher decision making when planning the integration of language with content. Westerman (1991) although not investigating such planning, offers insights when comparing the general planning of novice and expert elementary school teachers. Westerman found a number of factors influenced, consciously or unconsciously, expert teachers when they devised lesson objectives; namely their understanding of the curriculum, their values and beliefs and an awareness of their students’ needs and likely response to particular learning activities. Once the expert teachers had devised objectives, they drew on content and pedagogical knowledge to design learning activities. Westerman found that they formed ‘‘an image or mental representation of the lessons they plan that include their goals” (p. 298). Their expertise in planning was evident by the way teachers were able to integrate multiple sources of information and perform ‘‘a cognitive analysis of the learning task that lay ahead. . . and thought about the learning task from the perspective of the student” (p. 296). Westerman makes no mention, however, of teachers’ linguistic knowledge being used either to inform this cognitive analysis or bring a linguistic dimension to the goals set. Neither is mention made of knowledge about second language acquisition.

# 2.2. Factors affecting secondary teachers’ instructional decision making

Westerman (1991) identified factors that influence teacher decision making in planning at the elementary school level. For secondary teachers there may be additional factors that influence their planning. Kagan and Tippins (1992) pinpoint some of these factors in a study comparing the planning of primary and secondary teachers. Their seven English and history secondary teacher participants felt pressured to script lesson plans that gave students information through teacher talk rather than through peer discussions that enabled student to process information. While not specifically investigating planning, Franken and McComish’s classroom observations of twelve mainstream New Zealand secondary teachers with English language learners in their classes revealed the same predominance of teacher talk.

These teachers did not plan ‘‘a wide range of teaching techniques to enhance comprehension or student output” but they did give students significant input in the form of teacher talk (Franken and McComish, 2005, p. 19). The teachers in the Kagan and Tippins study also felt constrained by the quantity of content that needed to be covered before pupils took external examinations.

# 2.3. The value of descriptive accounts of teachers’ planning

Teachers and teacher educators need descriptive accounts of teacher decision making when planning units of work as well as an understanding of the factors that influence these decisions (Sardo Brown, 1993). Of particular value are accounts which detail the ways in which teachers plan a focus on language form in their content teaching and draw on theoretical input introduced in teacher education programmes. Teachers can use such accounts to consider and address issues arising from their planning, for instance the selection of linguistic goals, and the selection and sequencing of learning activities and language form. Teacher educators can use these accounts to examine critically the extent to which the theoretical input and conceptual tools introduced in courses inform teacher planning. Richards (1998) argues that such critical reflection occurs too rarely as teacher educators often assume the usefulness of input they provide. In addition, school administrators and policy makers can utilise such accounts to consider the conditions and resources required for informed planning.

# 3. The current study and research questions

In England and Australia one of the responses to the increased number of English language learners in mainstream classes has been to establish planning partnerships with mainstream content teachers and ESOL teachers (Arkoudis, 2003; Creese, 2002; Davison, 2001). In New Zealand one of the responses has been to institute incentives for all teachers, primary and secondary, ESOL and mainstream content, to undertake post-service qualifications in Teaching English in Schools to Speakers of Other Languages (TESSOL) (Feryok and Barkhuizen, 2008). As co-ordinator of one such programme and a former secondary content teacher, I wanted to examine the ways in which teachers used the theoretical input and conceptual tools from the course to plan, implement and evaluate language form in their teaching. In particular, I was interested in the relevance of the input for the secondary content teachers. I set up an action research project where same subject pairs of mathematics, science and social studies teachers used the input to plan, teach and evaluate a sequence of lessons (Gray, 2006). This paper reports on an aspect of that study – one pair’s use of principles to guide planning of a lesson sequence – and answers the research question:

(1) In what ways do secondary content teachers draw on principles from instructed language learning to design content lessons with a focus on language form?

# 4. Method

Working within the qualitative research tradition, I drew on Silverman’s (1993) advice that to understand a phenomenon, the ‘‘practical activity of participants in establishing a phenomenon-in-context” (p. 203) needed to be created. I used a hybrid methodology adapting guidelines from case study research (Merriam, 1998; Stake, 1995, 2000; Yin, 1984) and from action research (Cohen et al., 2000; Elliot, 1991; Ellis, 1997b; McTaggart, 1997) to make visible the activity of planning. The theoretical input and conceptual tools of the TESSOL programme provided the materials for planning.

# 4.1. Participants

The participants were a pair of secondary content teachers who taught social studies at the same secondary school. They were at similar stages in their teaching careers as Table 1 shows, but at different stages in their TESSOL qualification. Chris was completing the last paper in the programme and Rowan had graduated two years previously. For this study, Chris and Rowan chose to design a social studies lesson sequence for their year ten mainstream classes. The twenty students in each class came from a variety of L1 backgrounds but all had been learning English for at least a year. A number of the students in the classes were native speakers of English but found the language demands of social studies beyond their current linguistic repertoires.

# 4.2. Materials

At the beginning of the study each participant was given a Project Manual containing summaries of theoretical input covered in the TESSOL programme. This material and its suggested use in teacher planning is outlined according to Kaufman and Crandall’s (2005) identification of required aspects of teacher knowledge for English language learning in content teaching. Further theoretical background for each of the categories is listed in Appendix A.

4.2.1 Knowledge about language: lists of language functions and forms to identify the language demands of the topic: objectives, texts to be used, pertinent language functions and forms underpinning learning activities, and the final linguistic product for the external examination.   
4.2.2 Knowledge about language pedagogy: worksheets adapted from Elliot’s (1991) structure for beginning an action research project and designed to guide the teacher pair through planning their lesson sequence (Appendices B-E).   
4.2.3 Knowledge about second language acquisition: summaries of theoretical input regarding second language acquisition relevant to integrating language and content. From this material, teachers could distil principles (Appendix D) for guiding the specific planning focus required by the language and content needs that they identified.

# 4.3. Data collection

A number of methods were used to collect data:

(1) the focus group over the two days that the teacher pair used the worksheets (Appendices B-F) to guide their needs analysis, selection of principles and lesson design;   
(2) document analysis of these completed worksheets and journal entries of their reflections of the planning process, and   
(3) one hour interviews prior to and at the completion of their project.

# 4.4. Data analysis

The paired case study provided the basis for a rich descriptive account (Geertz, 1973) to be provided of the teachers’ practical activity; in particular of their instructional decisions and the theoretical input they applied in their lesson planning. From this account the two key ways in which the teachers drew on the principles in their planning were identified and further explored (Wolcott, 2001).

# 5. Findings

This section examines the ways in which the teacher pair drew on principles from instructed language learning to:

(1) address issues in integrating language form into their social studies planning, (2) define a specific teaching approach that would meet the current needs of their students and the demands of the current topic, (3) select and sequence pertinent learning activities and language form for the unit of work.

# 5.1. Address issues in integrating language form into their social studies planning

In initial interviews, prior to their project, both teachers were concerned about difficulties that they experienced in integrating language and content in their planning. Chris felt ‘‘stuck” and wanted to know how to incorporate a grammatical dimension in her planning. She believed that if she were to ‘‘lift her teaching to this next level”, some of her students’ difficulties with academic writing would be overcome. On the other hand, Rowan felt the demands of the curriculum and external assessment gave her insufficient time for a language focus.

She found implementing language activities took considerable class time and identified the classic planning dilemma of whether to ensure that she covered all aspects of the topic or to choose to explore some in more depth.

# 5.2. Define the approach to be taken

This section describes the way in which the teachers searched for key principles to define the specific approach that they would take when designing the lesson sequence. This search began with Chris and Rowan establishing a clear understanding of the nature of student language and content needs specific to the chosen topic.

Chris and Rowan taught two similar classes in the one school and identified two similar student content needs when exploring the topic How and Why Cultures Adapt and Change? (level six of the culture and heritage strand, in the social studies curriculum (Ministry of Education, 1997)). The first student need was to understand the concepts of change and participation in society and the social processes including values exploration and social decision-making. The teachers appreciated that the second requirement, communicating understanding of these abstract concepts, would be a demanding task for their students.

The pair agreed that their students struggled with the academic language demands in their subject area. Chris identified the most significant difficulty for her students as reading for understanding: they found most texts difficult and complex. The students also experienced difficulty in expressing ideas effectively and arguing a logical and convincing case. Students needed to ‘‘manipulate their language to show depth of understanding” and to remember important information (Chris Planning: Paired focus group). Rowan concurred with the language problems identified by Chris, noting that although students readily communicated information with each other, they were unable to express that understanding at an academic level. Rowan prioritised difficulty with vocabulary, particularly in understanding the abstract concepts in the content and key words in assessment tasks for example, argue, identify, and present information clearly and logically. Rowan also identified the need for additional support for reading to ensure understanding and opportunities for thinking through ideas before writing. She summarised the language needs that they had identified: ‘‘academic language proficiency, skills, grammar, genre to explore concepts at a depth required by the achievement objectives at level six in the curriculum and by the achievement standards” (Rowan: Appendix B).

The teachers combined, classified and ranked the four most significant language and content needs: first, vocabulary for understanding the social studies concepts; second, reading for understanding; third, opportunities for discussion and reading to promote depth of understanding of concepts, and, finally, expressing that understanding through academic writing (Chris and Rowan: Appendix C).

In light of their categorisation of these needs, the teachers critically examined their current teaching approaches. Chris suggested that the students were not currently ‘‘achieving at the depth of which they are capable” because ‘‘they do not get enough input to be able to present it in a sophisticated way.” She found herself simplifying text all the time. Rowan agreed and thought that she needed to reconsider the nature of the support she provided for writing. Her students still experienced difficulty in expressing depth of understanding independently.

I am really good at that scaffolded point but then trying to get students to do it on their own. . . I think my scaffolding is not building them up to that point (Chris and Rowan planning: paired focus group).

To find new direction for their pedagogical action, they paused in their discussion and turned for assistance to the literature – the summaries of articles in the Project Manual. Chris referred to Met (1994), acknowledging that although she was making language and content accessible to her students she was not currently ‘‘expanding and refining their language”. Rowan agreed:

Rowan: That’s what we’re talking about. Giving them the refined language and extending their language to the point where they can work at that depth, with the content.   
Chris: That’s what they’re lacking and that’s what we’re, no, I’m lacking with my teaching.   
Rowan: I am too. I guess that’s the point. How do you move into that next level?   
Chris: It’s very frustrating. I know what I need to do, but I don’t know how to do it. I know that I need to do better, but I’m not sure. (Chris and Rowan: Planning: Paired focus group).

Having clarified more precisely the gap between what their students needed and their current teaching, they returned to the summaries to find principles that would define a pedagogic approach to resolve this perceived discrepancy. After some time of reading, deliberation and discussion they adapted and modified two principles from Nation (1996a) from the Project Manual summary:

(1) Learners should process the concepts to be learnt as deeply and as thoughtfully as possible. The quality of the mental activity in the minds of the learner is the single most important factor as this learning takes place.   
(2) Learners should have the opportunity to work with the concepts in a variety of learning contexts, modelled, scaffolded and independent (from spoken to written) (Chris and Rowan: Appendix D).

In identifying these principles, the teachers had defined provisional specifications for the new level of pedagogical action for which they were searching. This action, they believed, would meet the needs of their students and clarified the current areas of difficulty in their teaching. Chris explained the illuminating effect of having decided on these principles:

The principles we have selected really sum up that area of confusion I think I am in with my teaching at the moment. I am in a period of ‘stuckness’ for want of a better word. (Chris: Journal, 10th October)

5.3. Selecting and sequencing of language form and learning activities for the unit

This section examines the way in which the teachers used these principles to help resolve perennial problems in planning lesson sequences, (1) selection and alignment of language and content objectives (2) selection of learning activities (3) preselection of language forms and (4) sequencing of the language demands and learning activities.

Chris and Rowan identified the final linguistic product required at the end of the sequence to focus further the selection and alignment of language and content objectives. This essay for an external examination was to Examine Change in our Society: Tokelau (lesson 7–8). They decided that if their students were to succeed in expressing their ‘‘depth of knowledge” in a written form, they would need the language to describe change and express cause and effect (Appendix F) and realised that specific language forms and content understanding would need careful alignment and sequencing in the first section of the unit (lessons 1–6). The way in which they interwove and developed these language and content objectives through the lesson sequence is shown in Table 2.

In selecting and designing the tasks, the teachers constantly referred back to the principles that they adapted from Nation (1996a), reminding themselves that their intention was to create opportunities for students to engage deeply with the key concepts in discussion before writing. They decided that the students would be able to grapple with the abstract nature of the topic by participating in paired and group problem solving and role-play tasks. Of the 21 proposed activities outlined in Table 3 and 18 had oral outcomes, based around a Soundbite Task, a Co-operative Jigsaw, and a Say-it Task. Early in the lesson sequence, a video depicting change in Tokelau through the perspectives of current residents would provide input for these tasks.

(Chris and Rowan: Appendix E, pp. 1–9).

Six of the proposed tasks related to different elements of the Sound Bite Task and illustrate the way Chris and Rowan had structured opportunities for the students to discuss the concepts of change. First, students would link quotations from different people in the video to key concepts such as ‘‘identity” and ‘‘society” that the quotes represented. Subsequently they would categorise these quotes and concepts according to whether they symbolised ‘‘change” or ‘‘maintenance.” Finally, when revisiting the causes of change in Tokelau prior to essay writing, the students would synthesise information from the different activities including the Sound Bite Task on an Information Transfer Grid. Five of the other tasks, in lessons four and five, related to a Co-operative Jigsaw: Meet the People, where once more students were to revisit describing change through the perspective of individuals from Tokelau.

Concurrent with this selection and design of activities, Chris and Rowan envisaged the language forms that would enable the students to process and express the concepts involved in examining change in both the activities and the final essay. They consulted their grammar texts and Appendix F, preselected forms and recorded these in detail beside each task. Examples of grammatical form included verbs (has transformed, is declining) to describe change, contrastive conjunctions to express contrast (whereas and nevertheless) and causal connectives to express cause and effect (on account of and since) (Chris and Rowan: Appendix E, pp. 1–9).They intended focusing on 42 lexical items relating to the social studies concepts, many within the first 2000 words (Nation, 1996b) (for example crime and village), and many, too, were abstract words, (for example, change, maintenance, identity, culture, and society). Others were low frequency words particular to Tokelau, local words, (fono, kaiga,) and names of people, (Tominiko and Ropati,) and places, (Fakaofo).

Chris and Rowan’s uptake of the second principle is seen in the way they sequenced the learning activities on two continua. The first continuum they used involved sequencing activities that moved from requiring spoken to written output when exploring and explaining the concepts. As shown in Table 3, the teachers planned that the students would work at depth with the concepts and the language forms, first, in vocabulary tasks defining culture, society, and change in lesson one, then through processing different perspectives in a range of tasks shown in Table 3, and, finally, in considering the impact of change through the prewriting tasks, Information Transfer and Writing Frames in lessons seven and eight. The second continuum they used related to the degree of support they structured for students in the activities, moving from modelled with teacher assistance, to scaffolded with peer assistance and finally to independent performance.

Although drawing on these principles assisted Chris and Rowan to be more precise in the selection and sequencing of language forms and learning activities for their lesson sequence, there were still unresolved dilemmas in task selection. In this case, the dilemma was deciding on the balance between opportunities for processing and opportunities for written output. During the planning Chris expressed concern at the possible overuse of tasks focused on processing concepts, rather than ones that would help students express their understanding through use of appropriate language forms in writing.

In reflecting on our learning principles used to underpin our unit I think we are building in lots of opportunities to process the concepts but I am not sure if we are getting to that sophistication in output yet. (Chris: Journal, 11th October).

# 6. Discussion

The teachers’ uptake of the above principles was influenced by a number of factors particularly the demands of the secondary context in which they were teaching (Kagan and Tippins, 1992) and their expectations for the students and beliefs in the efficacy of their current teaching (Westerman, 1991).

In selecting and adapting Nation’s principles which focused on the nature and type of activities that they were to design, the teachers were mindful of the constraints and affordances of the secondary context in which they taught. Wette (2005) described such a situation as one where the curriculum is prespecified and the final assessment tasks prescribed. The achievement objectives and the final linguistic outcome required for external assessment – an essay describing change – were prespecified, however, the topic was not. The teachers chose Tokelau as one that would be of interest and relevance to the students, many of whom came from the Pacific. The identification of these principles helped Chris and Rowan make explicit the theory that would guide their instructional decisions for planning this lesson sequence. The theory was generated from a close analysis of student need in light of the demands of the curriculum and external assessment. In their minds the principles that they adapted from Nation defined the nature of the pedagogic action that was required.

Chris and Rowan’s planning discussion reveals how their expectations and beliefs also influenced their choice of principles. They anticipated that their students could attain the final linguistic outcome and that their teaching would enable them to achieve this outcome. But both faced difficulties in integrating a language focus into their content teaching. Their frustration with their current level of teaching catalysed the search for more effective ways of bringing a language focus to their planning and shows how student and teacher learning can be intertwined. Adapting Nation’s principles gave them a theoretical justification for pedagogic action in planning that ran counter to common practice in secondary teaching (Kagan and Tippins, 1992; Franken and McComish, 2005). Their carefully designed paired, group and role play tasks gave the students opportunities to explore the concepts and language in depth. Chris and Rowan saw fostering student talk as important as teacher talk.

This examination of the secondary content teachers’ uptake of some of the theoretical input introduced in a TESOL teacher education programme has three implications for the programme: first, the balance of course time spent on knowledge about language, language pedagogy and SLA; second, additional theoretical input; third, the need to explore the role and conditions for teacher planning.

The teachers’ competence and confidence in crafting a lesson sequence that develops language and content through a range of learning activities reflects the programme’s emphasis on language pedagogy. A wide repertoire of strategies and activities (Nation (1995), for developing learners’ language skills and different guidelines for sequencing such activities (Cummins, 1986), has assisted teachers in moving from the scripted lesson plans prevalent in secondary classrooms. However, Chris’s concern about ways in which a grammatical element might be incorporated into her social studies teaching raised important questions for consideration:

(1) Was the emphasis on language pedagogy at the expense of time on knowledge about language and ways to utilise that knowledge in content teaching?   
(2) Were the principal texts (Derewianka, 1998; Knapp and Watkins, 1994) for the knowledge about language component too focused on primary teaching?

Secondary teachers, like Chris and Rowan, needed knowledge about language that focused on the specific language demands of their discipline (Martin, 2002; Schleppegrell, 2004; Unsworth, 1999 and see current work within the Council of Europe); ‘describing’ in science requires different language forms than ‘describing’ in social studies.

Second, an examination of the teachers’ uptake of the theoretical constructs introduced in the course also revealed the need for additional theoretical input in second language acquisition and language pedagogy. Current debates such as whether an approach should be planned that seeks to construct learners’ implicit or explicit knowledge of the language form (Doughty and Varela, 1998; Norris and Ortega, 2000), would give teachers’ additional guidance in more precise planning. Similarly, task based research would give teachers’ more specific analytical tools to calibrate the different components of the activities that they designed; input, conditions, processes and outcomes (Ellis, 2003).

The third implication for the TESSOL programme related to input concerning the curriculum design process. Teachers need to examine curriculum planning not only from the perspective of the current literature and research (Brown, 1995; Graves, 1996, 2000) but also from their own perspective and the school context in which they plan (Freeman and Johnson, 1998) An analytical tool such as the model provided by Westerman (1991) would enable teachers to consider the particular factors, internal and external, that influence their instructional decision making when planning.

# 7. Conclusion

This article has shown, using a descriptive account, one way teachers have put principles into practice – in the collaborative planning of a lesson sequence to meet the language needs of all students, including those new to English, who were acquiring the ability to communicate in the language of social studies. The teachers in the study used principles as a pivot between the needs analysis and subsequent planning and as the criteria for selecting and sequencing the learning activities. Drawing on these principles enabled the teachers to address needs they had experienced in their own teaching as well as those of their students. In other contexts, other principles would be chosen to assist teachers in their instructional decision making. The descriptive account also enabled a critical examination of the theoretical input in one TESOL teacher education programme.

I am indebted to the teachers and students who took part in the study, Rod Ellis and Gary Barkhuizen, my supervisors, and insightful comments received in the review process.

# Appendix A

# A.1. Knowledge about language

This material was adapted from Houston et al. (1989) who had identified some of the most frequently occurring functions and forms from a range of secondary content texts (Appendix F). Teachers could use this material along with their TESOL texts (Derewianka, 1998; Knapp and Watkins, 1994).

# A.2. Knowledge about language pedagogy

(1) Identifying and categorising students’ language and content needs in this topic (Appendices B and C).   
(2) Identifying shared principles to guide the lesson design process (Appendix D)   
(3) Planning the lesson sequence (Appendix E). This grid is a conceptual tool adapted from Gibbons (1991) to bring a language focus to content teaching and reflects an activity task based approach (Bygate, 1999; Leung, 2001; Willis, 1996) to language pedagogy.

A.3. Knowledge about second language acquisition

The material included:

language learning curriculum design principles (Nation, 1996a);   
the interactional, instructional, and cognitive demands of learning (Richards and Hurley, 1990);   
language and content curriculum alignment (Met, 1994);   
teaching content through a second language (Mohan, 2001);   
evaluation of content-language learning in the mainstream (Leung, 2001). In addition teachers had their second language acquisition textbook available (Ellis, 1997b).

# Appendix B. Identifying students’ content and language needs

# B.1. Worksheet: facts of the situation

Instructions: What problems with subject content do your students in this particular class have? List these problems in the chart. Now compare this list with your subject partner’s list.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Facts of the situation</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>1. 2.</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td></tr></table></body></html>

Instructions: What problems with language do your students in this particular class have? List these problems in the chart.

<html><body><table><tr><td>1.</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>2. 3.</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td></tr><tr><td>continue if necessary</td></tr></table></body></html>

# Appendix C. Categorising students’ language and content needs

C.1. Worksheet

Instructions: With your teacher partner classify the listed relevant facts. Categorise problems that cut across language and content.

Give each box a category heading and classify the relevant facts in it.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Category:</td><td>Category:</td></tr><tr><td>Category:</td><td>Category:</td></tr></table></body></html>

# Appendix D. Shared principles for designing and evaluating lesson sequence

Instructions: In light of the language and content needs you have identified and categorised in Appendices B and C, choose two most pertinent principles to guide your planning of the lesson sequence. These principles can also be used to gauge the effectiveness of your sequence in meeting student need.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Chosen principles pertinent to this unit</td><td>Data you will gather to evaluate the usefulness of these guiding principles.</td></tr><tr><td>Example Providing substantial quantities of. interesting comprehensible input Provide readings for the first ten minutes of class so that students are prepared for the paired discussion element in the. content lesson.</td><td>You will make notes about what is heard while students talk in pairs. All students monitor using peer checking grids for student discussion of readings in pairs and entries in their diaries. Your teacher partner interviews a pair of students about what they have learnt doing this particular</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>reading task.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

Appendix E. Planning grid for one lesson (adapted from Gibbons (1991)) Name Lesson
