Augmented reality Extended embodied cognition English for medical purposes Comprehension skills Robot-assisted language learning

Researchers have indicated that integrating augmented reality into robot-assisted language learning modules could visually represent the students’ learning needs and extend their embodied cognition of comprehension. To examine the potential of robots through extended embodied cognition, this quasi-experimental study was conducted in the English for Medical Purposes classrooms at the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. In the 2022 academic year, 526 male and female participants, whose first language is not English, were selected. Students were sorted into three English proficiency levels: pre-intermediate $( { \mathfrak { n } } ~ = ~ 1 7 6 )$ ), intermediate $\mathbf { ( n ~ = ~ } 1 7 5$ ), and upper-intermediate $\mathbf { \dot { n } } ~ = ~ 1 7 5$ , then semirandomly divided into three-member teams, subsequently, randomly assigned to control $[ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 3 7 0 $ ) or experimental ${ \mathrm { ' n } } = 1 5 6 { \mathrm { ' } }$ ) groups. Students in the control group learned English for Medical Purposes listening and reading through online classrooms, while those in the experimental group learned the skills in robot (augmented reality)-assisted classrooms. In the control and experimental groups, flipped classrooms were conducted under the supervision of the teachers. The primary data sources included formative assessments of the participants’ English for Medical Purposes listening and reading, as well as interviews. The findings showed that the participants in the robot’s augmented reality group achieved significantly higher results, when compared with robot-only and control groups, in English for Medical Purposes listening and reading in academia and the healthcare fields. The positive perception participants had of robot’s augmented reality was clear, based on interview results. The outcomes are discussed in detail.

# 1. Introduction

Developing English for Specific Purposes (ESP) listening and reading is a cognitively demanding process (Piolat et al., 2005; Satori, 2022). Due to the importance of cognition and comprehension in ESP contexts and the emergence of robot-assisted language learning modules (Chen Hsieh and Lee, 2021; Nair et al., 2019; van den Berghe et al., 2019), there has been a surge of interest in the concept of embodied cognition over the last decade. Robots, embodied with humanoid physiques (arms, legs, face), can enhance individuals’ cognition of comprehension (Zheng et al., 2022), which can assist with social interaction (Duffy, 2004). Co-verbal gestures (e.g., simultaneous movement of fingers and hands) generally foster embodied cognition for listening and reading comprehension (Ofemile, 2022). In tandem, a shift has also been made toward extended embodied cognition (Kuo et al., 2014; Sadoski, 2018) following the Dual Coding Theory (Chen, 2022). Extended embodied cognition for ESP comprehension is a multidimensional combination of different but supportive constituents (verbal and nonverbal glosses) entwined by their practical orientation toward understanding the learning needs in authentic settings (Fugate et al., 2019). Although research has been conducted on supporting students’ cognition of comprehension (e.g., Wakamoto and Rose, 2021), there has been a scarcity of studies relating to the augmented humanoid body of robots as an easily tailor-made tool to practice according to the circumstances in academic and professional settings (e.g., Atman Uslu et al., 2022; Budhwar et al., 2022).

Based on a review of relevant theories, Hsiao and colleagues (2022) introduced the co-verbal gestures of robots as a major constituent for forming embodied cognition of comprehension. According to Lee and Lee (2022), learning language through the augmented humanoid body of robots prepares the ground for interaction with the world. As a concrete repertoire for cognition of comprehension, a robot’s augmented reality (robot’s AR) pertains to embodied and extended cognition (Han, 2010).

Therefore, while being associated with developing the cognitive process of listening and reading, AR superimposes visual and verbal glosses on gestures and postures of robots to enhance the cognition of comprehension (Buchner et al., 2022). In particular, the cognition of comprehension is intermingled into English for Medical Purposes (EMP) listening and reading, and attention should be directed to how this could be facilitated to support students in understanding their learning needs in authentic settings. There is often a broad recommendation for how students should capitalize on verbal and non-verbal glosses of practice (Bonsignori, 2018).

According to Kurniawan and colleagues (2021), although research on robot’s AR-assisted learning in higher education is ongoing, there has been scant attention in language classrooms of medical universities. The researchers noted that this scarcity of research in EMP listening and reading is unexpected because communication of learning needs in academic and professional settings is highly dependent on comprehension. Besides, Teo et al. (2022) have stated that the cognition of EMP comprehension is at the core of language programs in countries where English is not widely spoken as a first language; yet, it has waited in the shadows in the preceding decade of educational technology-assisted studies in medical universities. Bahari (2022) explained this shortfall by pointing out that research has concentrated chiefly on using educational technology for teaching EMP listening and reading about current learning needs, with no realistic thought for developing the cognition of comprehension. Accordingly, from the perspective of cognitive development of EMP comprehension, this study departs from the naïve application of robot’s AR, concentrating on extending embodied cognition for EMP listening and reading with reliance on the social facet of the practice. As Jakonen and Jauni (2021) have stated, regarding recent progress in developing robots’ bodies through the virtual interface, it seems indispensable to utilize this augmented practice in favor of cognition of comprehension to support students in understanding and manipulating the learning needs in the world.

Linderholm and colleagues (2014) argued that augmented cognition of comprehension can help students’ understanding during communicative events and also help students understand their learning needs for success in future communicative events. The significance of enhancing cognition is well captured in Johal and colleagues’ (2018) study, which endeavors to expound on what cognition of comprehension is and how robots can remove constraints from students’ cognition for reading. Nevertheless, for the most part, as Li and colleagues (2016) mention, there is little research on how robot-assisted language learning modules in universities help students manage their cognition to prosper in comprehension with the primary goal of flourishing in authentic communication. The prospect is that with the recent rise of robot’s AR (Michalos et al., 2016; Wang and Wang, 2021), which entered the field of language learning in higher education just in the past decade (Khazaie et al., 2022), more attention can be paid to cognition in EMP listening and reading education.

While numerous studies have been conducted on verbal and non-verbal constituents of robots and AR in medical language education (e.g., Kupferman, 2022; Velentza et al., 2021; Yang and Mei, 2018), no nuanced research examined the true potential of these constituents for easing the cognition of EMP comprehension. To fill the research gap, this study investigated the potential of a robot’s AR for enhancing the cognition of EMP listening and reading among students in a university in Southwest Asia.

# 2. Background

# 2.1. Dual Coding Theory and cognition

As comparatively new concepts, embodied cognition and extended cognition have been defined regarding different language skills since their initiation. For Foglia and Wilson (2013), embodied cognition depends on co-verbal gestures and body language plays a significant role in cognitive processing. Following Paivio’s (1986) Dual Coding Theory, Clark (2008) proposed extended embodied cognition to promote the idea that the cognitive process of comprehension depends on the concrete scenes of practice.

Sanches de Oliveira (2022) upheld that embodied and extended cognition are two ends of a continuum in ESP compre hension, in which students can move on to understand their needs. In ESP education, Garofoli (2019) referred to extended embodied cognition as an academic- and professional-related state of cognition characterized by the body-world nexus.

As the strands of research pay greater attention to the social-psychological mainstream in ESP education, priority has been given to developing the cognition of comprehension for effective communication. In congruence with the socialpsychological mainstream, embodied cognition dependents on body gestures and extended cognition highlights the social environment of the world, favorably paving the way for comprehension (Collado, 2017; Hsu et al., 2022). Correspondingly, during the last decade, interest in applying educational technology tools in language classrooms of higher education has turned researchers’ attention to the co-existence of body gestures and authentic settings (Aljawarneh, 2020). Higher levels of ESP listening and reading proficiency tend to result in successful outcomes in both learning sites and workspaces, including effective communication, concerted contribution to addressing needs, more informed predictions, and flawless performance (Hsieh and Huang, 2020; Tschirner, 2016).

Examining a sample of 22 students from four universities in East Asia, Shin (2017) focused on the extended value of using mobile games in enhancing cognition for learning. Results revealed that extended cognition resulted from the viability of games in representing authentic settings. One question that needs to be asked, however, is whether mobile games in university language classrooms have the potential to be intermingled with other tools to enhance cognition. In a robot-assisted language learning study with two collegiate students in Taiwan, Chen and colleagues (2022) examined the application of robot-assisted modules to represent the students’ learning needs adequately. The results indicated that robot-assisted language learning modules helped students visualize their needs in actual life. As expected, because of embodied cognition, participants reported a conceptual understanding of the materials. It was also found that an adequate understanding of materials prepared students for more gainful involvement.

In another review study, Parmaxi (2020) explored the possible effects of students’ interactions with natural surroundings through the lens of virtual reality glasses as an ideal vehicle for extending cognition for ESP learning. This study focused on extending cognition for comprehension by portraying the natural environment in the classrooms. It was found that virtual reality represented authentic settings for ESP learning. However, the research would have been more relevant if a broader range of cognition had been explored.

As to research on simultaneously embodying and extending the cognition for EMP comprehension through robot-assisted modules in university language education, it is made clear that there is insufficient research in this area, and previous studies have usually attended to embodied cognition, subscribing to the view that robots mostly exemplify the features of communication (Maniscalco et al., 2021; Mikolajczyk et al., 2017). The studies on applying the simulation-based nature of games in university language learning have mainly focused on extended cognition (e.g., Constant et al., 2022; Peschl and Fundneider, 2012) rather than embodied cognition. However, this study endeavors to highlight the state of the non-verbal features in the cognition of EMP comprehension and reconcile extended and embodied cognition for EMP education.

# 2.2. Robot-assisted language learning and cognition

Following robot-assisted language learning and its reestablishment through the Internet in higher education (Khazaie et al., 2021), the past disposition of researching extended cognition for target language comprehension was replaced with putting embodied cognition at the center of its extended construction, aiming to promote students’ comprehension for effective communication (Istenic et al., 2021; Taniguchi et al., 2016).

Embodied cognition emphasizes that the humanoid body of a robot and its coverbal gestures are central to comprehension (Lin et al., 2022). Liao and colleagues (2022) introduced the reasonably prominent feature of embodied cognition in robotassisted modules for learning language skills in higher education, characterized by the possibility of enhanced thought in practicing comprehension. Enhanced thought relates to being able to easily visualize the learning needs relying on non-verbal attributes of robots as the academic and professional settings require.

Various studies in the past examined embodied cognition about university language comprehension and production skills. Cheng and colleagues (2020) explored the cognitive development of communication by evaluating twelve teachers on the potential the bodily gestures of robots show in easing language learning. The findings revealed that compared with teachers’ co-verbal gestures, robots are more student-centered, embodying the practice of communication through their tailor-made bodily gestures and postures to support the cognition of target language learning. Relying on embodied cognition, Lee and Lee (2022) reviewed the results of robot-assisted language learning research. The findings revealed that as the humanoid body of robots has the potential to be directed towards helping students address their learning needs, it can help engage the cognitive development of language learning. The customized non-verbal gestures of the robots help to negotiate meanings in academic and professional settings.

Considering the Dual Coding Theory, Zhu and Katsri (2023) argued that extending the embodied cognition for examining the potential of robot-assisted modules in university language education seems indispensable, as it allows for a multidimensional representation of the learning needs in learning sites. Accordingly, this study intends to continue this developing line of research in establishing real-life-like settings for learning ESP that began in the recent decade (e.g., Donnermann et al., 2022; Engwall et al., 2021; Li, 2022) to approach the Dual Coding Theory in language classrooms of medical higher education.

# 2.3. Augmented reality-assisted language learning and cognition

Parallel with the recent flourishing of robot-assisted learning in the social-psychological mainstream for language learning in higher education, AR is the subject of an investigation for enhancing the learning potential of robots through visual and verbal glosses (Williams et al., 2020). A concept highlighted in such research efforts is extended embodied cognition, which is defined in different terms (Malinin, 2019). To Ellis (2019), extended cognition draws on the view that the cognitive process of communication depends on the interaction between non-verbal gestures and the natural surroundings. From another vantage point, Beckerle et al. (2019) maintained that the interaction between non-verbal gestures and the world exemplifies the cognitive process of language learning to address actual learning needs. Augmented reality-assisted language learning employs visual scenes and verbal glosses to fulfill different functions by representing authentic settings, while the verbal glosses overlaid on these scenes open the way for interaction with the world.

Accordingly, a robot’s AR is a verbally- and visually-enhanced vehicle to help students gain visualization and understanding of the world (Makhataeva and Varol, 2020). Within ESP education, bound with recurrent academic and professional samples, Quintero et al. (2018) theorized that students’ bodies engaging with the ARs might be embodied as the main item of the cognitive communication process. Zhong et al. (2021), with a review of the studies on educational technology-assisted language learning, put forward two types of cognition typically considered by game developers in designing AR: extended cognition and embodied cognition. Game developers use authentic settings in AR to instantiate extended cognition. Equally, embodied cognition refers to representing body features through animated characters in scenes of AR to ease comprehension.

Since the introduction of games into language education, the cognitive processes of language learning have been wellresearched, helping to specify their untapped potential. For instance, Chen (2019) examined the animated scenes of AR in ESP reading of 48 junior nursing students in Taiwan. The data analysis revealed that the enhanced cognitive reading process facilitated comprehension and outperformance in professional contexts. In contrast, static scenes of the ARs, which were relatively limited to the representation of scenes without human characters, did not show great potential for comprehension. In another study, Ferrer- Torregrosa et al. (2015) investigated the interactive role of characters in AR with 211 Spanish students in medical university comprehension. The findings highlighted that links between the students and the characters of the AR helped students realize factual details for comprehending needs and manipulating post-academic situations. Further, Chen et al. (2017) reviewed studies on how AR-assisted university language learning facilitates students’ understanding of subject-area-oriented needs in academic settings. The results provided sufficient insights that university language learning is not restricted only to embodied cognition but also associated with extended cognition.

Despite its prominence in various areas of research, the development of the cognitive process of ESP learning has been the focus of few investigations in AR-assisted language learning, focusing mainly on the naïve relationship between practicing language skills through real-life-like scenes and language learning (e.g., Arvanitis and Krystalli, 2021; Garzón and Acevedo, 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). In particular, it is also believed that EMP comprehension is an innately cognitively demanding process considering the verbal and non-verbal features to address the needs (Deveci and Saleem, 2022).

Therefore, the primary goal of this study is to promote embodied and extended cognition for EMP comprehension. It is hoped that with the increased focus on cognition of EMP comprehension, the investigation of incorporating ARs into robot-assisted language learning modules (robot’s AR) may also come to the fore in medical language education. The questions are as follows:

1. Is there any significant difference in learning gains between the students’ EMP listening and reading comprehension in the control and robot’s AR-assisted groups? 2. What is the participants’ perception regarding enhancing the cognition for EMP comprehension?

# 3. Method

# 3.1. Participants

A total of 531 male $N = 2 5 5$ , $4 8 \%$ ) and female $( N = 2 7 6 , 5 2 \%$ ) participants from the fields of medicine $N = 1 9 4$ ), pharmacy $N = 1 7 6$ ), and dentistry $N = 1 6 1$ ) were selected. They were Arab $( N = 8 1$ ), Pakistani $N = 1 3 2$ ), Indian $N = 4 9$ , and Iranian $N = 2 6 9$ ) students who took the obligatory course of EMP in the fall semester of the 2022 academic year at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences located in Iran. They were aged between 19 and 21 years $( \mathrm { m e a n } = 2 0 . 0 6 \pm 1 . 7 . $ ). Upon consent, 526 students participated in the study and their English comprehension was assessed through a Ministry of Health Language Examination (MHLE). The MHLE test with 100 multiple-choice questions assesses English comprehension skills, including listening and reading. It provides students with levels within the calculated value of comprehension related to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (Marandi et al., 2020). The participants’ proficiency was scored by counting the correct responses and computing a percent in three levels: pre-intermediate $5 0 \mathrm { - } 6 9 \%$ , $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 1 7 6$ ), intermediate $7 0 \mathrm { - } 8 9 \%$ , $\mathtt { n } = 1 7 5$ ), and upper-intermediate $9 0 - 1 0 0 \%$ , $\mathtt { n } = 1 7 5$ ). Based on participants’ English proficiency levels, students were semirandomly divided into heterogeneous teams of three members. Then, the participants were randomly assigned to control or experimental groups. The experimental group was subdivided into subgroups: robot and robot’s AR. Based on the square root rule, when the number of experimental groups is more than one, the sample size of the control group should be at least $\sqrt { 2 }$ times the size of the experimental group (Chow and Liu, 2008); as such, the number of participants in the control group $\mathbf { \tilde { n } } = 3 7 0 $ ) was $\sqrt { 2 }$ times the number in the experimental group $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { n } = 1 5 6 \mathrm { \Delta }$ ). The groups are shown in Figure 1.

# 3.2. Procedure

This study was considered quasi-experimental as the participants were semi-randomly divided into three-member teams, subsequently randomly assigned to control and experimental groups. Because the control and experimental groups had different treatments, this study was conducted in 16 weeks through a parallel design in three stages as follows:

Stage I: Introduction (week 1): To help participants become familiar with flipped classrooms, in the first week, a 70-min pilot session was held. Initially, participants watched a pre-recorded online lecture for $3 0 ~ \mathrm { \ m i n }$ . Then, while participants in the control group practiced the reading and listening skills through online tasks, participants in the experimental groups practiced the skills through robot’s (AR) tasks for $1 4 \mathrm { \ m i n }$ . Finally, participants took part in online listening and reading assessments for $1 6 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ . The teachers answered the participants’ questions throughout this session.

Stage II: Self-learning, practice, and formative assessment (weeks 2–15): Employing (Robot’s AR) flipped classrooms in each 60-min session, self-learning was followed by practicing and assessment through NAVID, the university learning management system (http://muinavid.smums.ac.ir). Each flipped classroom was conducted as follows:

Self-learning (at the beginning of each session): In the flipped classrooms, participants were initially introduced to listening and reading materials from the lecture series. For each academic discipline, the lead researcher, in collaboration with five content teachers, prepared 14 online lectures in complete reliance on the books. The listening and reading materials were selected from English for students of pharmacy (Ghafghazi et al., 2019), English for students of medicine (Atai et al., 2019), and English for students of dentistry (Tahririan et al., 2021). The lecture content was the same in the groups, each was $3 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ in length. The delivery of lectures was undertaken using a virtual classroom software (Adobe Connect) under the surveillance of the teachers.

Practice (following the self-learning): When the participants watched the lectures, they gathered in three-member teams to practice EMP listening and reading through online, robot-, or robot’s AR-assisted tasks in $1 4 \mathrm { m i n }$ . The content of the tasks was the same in each academic discipline and developed in line with the materials.

Online tasks: To practice EMP listening and reading in the online flipped classrooms, for each academic discipline, 14 tasks were developed by the researchers to be practiced collectively. In the 14-min online tasks, the teachers, through avatar, appeared in an inpatient room and recorded the standard’s patient complaint. Simultaneously, the teachers dispatched the complaint with recommendations (in multiple-choice format) on participants’ mobile devices using Google Meet. Participants in three-member teams took turns to read or listen to the recorded complaints. Then, they collaborated to select appropriate options to tell the teachers. When participants selected a suitable option, the teachers either verified their responses (useable), or rejected their responses (not useable). To establish a similar practicing situation as that of the robots, the teachers had been instructed by the lead researcher to provide immediate written feedback for students, namely, useable: continue; not useable: back to the previous stage. A sample of online tasks for practicing English for Dentistry Purposes comprehension skills is displayed in Appendix A.

Robot-assisted tasks: Regarding each academic discipline, 14 listening and reading tasks were uploaded into a robot’s database to be displayed through the chest monitor. This physical robot with a humanoid physique was designed in the Incubator and Entrepreneurship Center of the University of Isfahan. The robot, through robotic feet, a compass, and moving obstacle avoidance sensors, reached the inpatient unit. The inpatient needs were recorded through vision and voice recognition sensors. After recording the needs, the robot was directed to clinic grounds near the inpatient unit. As the inpatients’ needs had been recorded verbally in an album in the robot’s database, students accessed the album on the robot’s chest monitor through the camera of their mobile devices and the Internet. They could watch and modify the content of the monitor directly on the screen of their mobile devices. Students gathered in three-member teams through a voice chat system of NAVID for $1 4 \mathrm { m i n }$ to select the right option through the monitor to run the robot toward the inpatient’s room. In Figure 2, to adopt an effective method from the recommended options in the robot’s chest monitor, medicine students collaborate to listen to or read a patient history on the robot’s monitor. If the choice is correct, the robot continues working. Otherwise, it stops.

Robot’s AR-assisted tasks: Just as the robot-assisted tasks, considering the academic disciplines, the listening and reading contents were uploaded to the database of the physical robot. Participants’ access to the content of the robot was possible through AR apps on their mobile devices. In $1 4 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ , participants could visualize the robot in different situations, use voice chat to collaborate to read and listen to the recorded content and select the right option from among the available buttons to drag and drop to the right place in the robot’s monitor. Unity engine was used to develop the ARs. This engine is extensively used to create two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) games (Foxman, 2019). The 3D model of the robot was developed by 3ds Max. Game developers use the modeling capacities of 3ds Max to represent natural scenes of the world. The generated application was an Android Package Kit (APK) file that allowed students to proceed with the tasks through their Android mobile devices. A snapshot of a robot’s AR is shown in Figure 3.

Also, a comparison between the tasks is displayed in Appendix B. The tasks were deemed to be similar and thus appropriate for comparison. Robots and ARs instead of cinematic background images of online tasks were the characteristic features of robots and robot’s ARs.

Formative assessment (at the end of each session): Regarding the academic disciplines, participants’ progress during the course was assessed formatively in both learning sites and virtual fields as follows:

a) Online assessment in learning sites: After practicing the EMP listening and reading skills, the assessment of participants’ comprehension was conducted for $1 6 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ through NAVID. The assessment questions were the same for the groups. In each session, also, participants were informed about their 0–20 scores. The comprehension assessments are as follows:

Listening assessment: To assess participants’ EMP listening in $8 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ , for each session, five tailor-made dialogues were developed by the researchers and five content teachers. The dialogues were held by two virtual speakers. Each participant listened to a conversation between the speakers and answered the multiple-choice questions asked by a third party (speaker). The participants’ answers were recorded by the system and were automatically scored. While the correct answer to each listening question had two scores, the incorrect answers had none. Accordingly, in each session, participants’ listening was assessed from 0 to 10. For example, in Figure 5, two virtual speakers in a dentistry classroom talk about the potential of saliva as an indicator of disease. A dentistry student listens to the dialogue to answer the questions of the third speaker.

Figure 5. A sample of a listening question, Adapted from Freepik (https://www.freepik.com).

Reading assessment: To assess participants’ EMP reading in the $8 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ , the short-context technique (Farhadi et al., 2007) was deployed. For each session, two tailor-made stimuli with five multiple-choice questions were developed. Participants’ correct answers to each comprehension question had two scores (incorrect answers had no score). In each session, the participants’ reading was recorded and automatically assessed in the score range of 0–10. The assessments were developed by the researchers in collaboration with five content teachers, in to assure content validity (Taherdoost, 2016). The short paragraph in Figure 6 contains sentences that describe a medical condition that a pharmacist encounters. Each student read the sentences and select a medicine from the multiple-choice response.

b) Assessment in the healthcare field: The assessment of participants’ professional comprehension was done in a virtual clinic through the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) twice, namely in the middle and end of the course, for 16 min. The OSCE was administered to participants individually, where the communication medium was English. The scenes and contents of the virtual clinic varied depending on the participants’ academic discipline. As to listening, the participants took part in a conversation with a standard patient and attempted to address the patient’s needs. The length of the conversation was 8 min. Besides, the participants’ professional reading was assessed in $8 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ , where each participant read a standard patient’s history and made a response. To meet the patient’s needs, participants marked an appropriate option from among the written multiple-choice recommendations within the virtual clinic. The conversation and history were displayed only once. To score the participants’ responses to the standard patients, questions of the OSCE had been created and categorized along with a rubric. Five English and content teachers, none of whom had taught the course, developed a rubric and scored participants’ responses on three levels: approaching acceptable (0), acceptable (1), and above acceptable (2). The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient for the scoring reliability was calculated to be $\Gamma = 0 . 7 9$ . They also developed oral and written contents of the histories of the standard patient. Accordingly, the OSCE had face and content validity (Schmidt, 2012). The rubric is presented in Figure 7.

In Figure 8, a snapshot of a virtual inpatient room for history taking is displayed. Each student (as a physician) listens to a standard patient’s complaints, consisting of isolated sentences (stimuli), to make a diagnosis. Then, the student selects a suitable response. In this inpatient room, each student is also required to read a standard patient’s history and select a helpful recommendation in response to the complaint.

Stage III: Interview (week 16): To debrief the participants’ perception of the course, adopting Hilliard et al.’s (2020) interview framework, an interview guide with five open-ended prompts around the second research question was developed by the lead researcher. Three prompts had further questions to elicit more information from the participants. A sample of interview prompts is shown in Figure 9.

Would you elaborate on your EMP listening and reading proficiency in the [..] course and field?

What were the causes of your successful EMP listening and reading in the [... course and field?

How did your EMP listening and reading affect your performance in the [.] course and field?

How could have the Asian universities of medical sciences established opportunities through social robots and educational technology to facilitate students' comprehension?

To ensure the trustworthiness of the focus-group interviews, Shenton’s (2004) strategies were utilized. The researchers: a) explained the process of decision-making (credibility); b) provided detailed information about the context of the study (transferability); c) provided replication logic (dependability); and d) clarified their standpoint in the study (confirmability). One hundred and sixty-two students signed the consent form. They earned a reward of free access to the university database for two months. Twenty-seven students with the highest and lowest EMP comprehension scores were selected through purposive sampling. Regarding the participants’ first language, four focus groups of six students were formed. The interviews were conducted through the BigBlueButton open-source web conferencing system for about $4 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ . The researchers, in collaboration with two applied linguists, transcribed the students’ responses. The procedure of this study is depicted in Figure 10.

# 3.3. Quantitative data analysis

The normality of the gathered data was examined through a QQ plot and histogram. The skewness and kurtosis of the normal distribution were close to zero. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used through linear mixed models, adjusting the effect of proficiency to see the potential of the robot’s AR in supporting participants’ cognition of EMP listening and reading. Estimates of Fixed Effects were used to examine the difference between the mean scores of the groups $( p < 0 . 0 5 )$ .

# 3.4. Qualitative data analysis

The interview transcripts were subjected to content analysis through thematic analysis. The themes were determined through an inductive approach. To define the themes, Creswell and Poth’s (2018) procedure was utilized as follows:

Four coders, all applied linguists, coded the interview transcripts. When one-third of the transcripts were coded, the lead researcher developed the primitive codebook with 26 codes. This codebook was used for the mini-paragraph of the remaining transcripts. Adopting Miles and colleagues’ (2018) $8 0 \%$ agreement of coding, ten common codes were defined. The lead researcher revised the codebook with nine codes. Finally, the codes were changed into eight themes under two linguistics and non-linguistic categories. The qualitative data were analyzed through the qualitative analysis software MAXQDA 2022.

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Quantitative results

The first research question asked, “Is there any significant difference in learning gains between the students’ EMP listening and reading in the control and robot’s AR-assisted groups?” To answer this question, this section is broken down into two subsections.

# 4.1.1. Analyzing the progress in comprehension

According to Table 1, the total mean of EMP listening scores shows that the scores of the participants in the robot $M = 1 2 . 9 6$ , $S D = 0 . 7 8$ ) and the robot’s AR $M = 1 4 . 7 9$ , $\mathsf { S D } = 0 . 8 9 $ ) subgroups were higher than the control group $M = 1 0 . 2 2$ , $S D = 1 . 6 6 $ ). Similarly, the total mean of EMP reading indicated that the participants in the robot $M = 1 2 . 9 6$ , $S D = 0 . 6 7 $ ) and robot’s AR $M = 1 4 . 9 6$ , $S D = 0 . 8 5$ ) subgroups scored higher than the participants in the control group $M = 1 1 . 0 1$ , $S D = 1 . 5$ ). The result of analyzing the data linear mixed models revealed that during the course, there were significant differences between the participants’ EMP listening $( \mathrm { F } _ { 1 3 , 3 2 1 8 . 7 9 } = 2 3 5 . 6 1$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ ) and reading scores $( \mathrm { F } _ { 1 3 , 3 7 2 4 . 7 0 } = 2 4 3 . 4 5$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ ). It may be inferred that technology-assisted modules facilitated comprehension. The interaction of time and group showed that the rate of progress in listening (F2 $6 , 3 2 1 8 . 7 9 = 4 3 . 6 6$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ ) and reading ( $\mathrm { F } _ { 2 6 } , 3 7 2 4 . 7 0 = 3 1 . 4 8$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ) was significantly different. There were also significant differences between EMP listening (F2, $7 4 3 . 2 7 \ : = \ : 3 1 . 3 3$ , $p ~ < ~ 0 . 0 0 1$ ) and reading $( \mathrm { F } _ { 2 , 6 1 1 . 1 3 1 } = 3 1 . 1 8$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ) scores in the groups. The participants’ English proficiency did not make a significant difference in listening $( \mathrm { F } _ { 1 , 7 5 0 . 3 5 } = 1 . 3 7 , p > 0 . 0 5 )$ ) and reading $( \mathrm { F } _ { 1 , 6 1 1 . 1 } = 0 . 3$ , $p > 0 . 0 5 $ ). In the groups, the participants’ proficiency also did not make significant difference in their listening ( $\mathsf { F } _ { 2 , 7 5 0 . 3 5 } = 0 . 1 9$ , $p > 0 . 0 5$ ) and reading $( \mathrm { F } _ { 2 , 6 1 1 . 1 } = 0 . 1 , p > 0 . 0 5 )$ . It follows that it is not possible to establish clear connection between students’ proficiency and their comprehension in technology-assisted language learning modules.

$^ { * * } p < 0 . 0 0 1$

Taking robot’s AR as a reference group, Estimates of Fixed Effects showed that the listening $\mathrm { \beta } = - 3 . 3 1$ , $S E = 0 . 5 3$ ) and reading $\beta = - 3 . 1 9$ , $S E = 0 . 5 2$ ) scores in the control group were significantly lower than the scores in the experimental group $\lceil p < 0 . 0 5 \rceil$ ). While the listening ( $\beta = 0 . 7 8$ , $S E = 0 . 6 2$ ) scores in the robot’s AR subgroup were not significantly higher than the scores in the robot subgroup $( p > 0 . 0 5 )$ , the reading scores in the robot subgroup ( $\beta = - 1 . 9$ , ${ \cal S } \mathrm { E } = 0 . 6 1$ ) were significantly lower than the scores in the robot’s AR subgroup $( p < 0 . 0 5 )$ ).

# 4.1.2. Analyzing the professional listening and reading scores

To continue answering the first research question regarding the listening and reading in the fields, according to Table 2, the mean scores of the listening in the control group $M = 7 . 5 2$ , $S D = 2 . 1 7$ ) and the robot subgroup $M = 7 . 8 3$ , $S D = 0 . 9 4$ ) were lower than the listening scores $M = 1 3 . 5 6$ , $S D = 0 . 8$ ) in the robot’s AR subgroup. The pooled mean scores of reading in the control group $M = 1 0 . 7 ,$ , $S D = 1 . 2 7$ ) were lower than the mean scores of reading in the robot’s $M = 1 0 . 6 3$ , $S D = 1 . 0 3$ ) and robot’s AR $M = 1 3 . 9 8$ , $S D = 1 . 1 1$ ) subgroups.

As shown in Table 2, during the course there were significant differences between the professional listening $( \mathsf { F } _ { 1 , ~ 4 3 3 } = 2 6 6 . 0 5$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ) and reading scores $( \mathrm { F } _ { 1 , 4 3 3 } = 1 2 1 8 . 5 3$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ) in the fields. The interaction of time and group showed significant differences in listening $\mathrm { F } _ { 2 , 4 3 3 } = 9 5 . 7 $ $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ) and reading scores $\mathrm { ' F } _ { 2 , 4 3 3 } = 3 5 5 . 8 5$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ). It can be posited that enhancing students’ cognition for comprehension through robot’ co-verbal gestures, over time, can supports students’ comprehension. Regarding comprehension in the fields, there were also significant differences between the groups’ listening $\mathrm { ' F } _ { 2 , 4 3 3 . 1 5 } = 3 2 . 0 4$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ) and reading $( \mathrm { F } _ { 2 , 4 3 3 } = 2 7 5 . 3 4$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ). This may suggest that extending embodied cognition through the robot’s AR could pave the way for a sufficient understanding of the needs in the fields. The participants’ English proficiency before the program did not make significant differences in their listening $\mathrm { ~ F } _ { 1 , 4 3 0 } = 0 . 6 3$ , $p > 0 . 0 5$ ) and reading $\mathrm { ^ T F } _ { 1 , 4 3 0 } = 0 . 3 7$ , $p > 0 . 0 5$ ) performance in the fields. The interaction of participants’ English proficiency and group also did not result in significant differences between listening $( \mathrm { F } _ { 2 , 4 3 0 } = 0 . 4 9$ , $p > 0 . 0 5$ ) and reading $( \mathrm { F } _ { 2 , 4 3 0 } = 0 . 5 2$ , $p > 0 . 0 5$ performance. It would seem to imply that students’ proficiency levels cannot ease the process of extending their comprehension through verbal and non-verbal cues of robots and ARs.

The results of Estimates of Fixed Effects revealed that the mean scores of professional listening in the control group $\beta = - 6 . 2 6$ , $S E = 0 . 8$ ) were significantly lower than the scores in the robot’s AR subgroups $( p < 0 . 0 5 )$ . However, the results showed that the listening scores in the robot subgroup $\beta = - 1 . 4 8$ , $S E = 0 . 9 4 _ { . }$ ) were not significantly lower than the professional listening scores in the robot’s AR subgroup $( p > 0 . 0 5 )$ ). Regarding the professional reading, it was revealed that the scores in the control group $\beta = - 7 . 3$ , $S E = 0 . 7 3$ ) and robot subgroups $\beta = - 3$ , $S E = 0 . 8 6 $ ) were significantly lower than the scores in the robot’s AR subgroups $\left( p < 0 . 0 5 \right)$ ).

# 4.2. Qualitative results

To answer the second research question, “What is the participants’ perception regarding enhancing the cognition for EMP comprehension?” this section is divided into two subsections: themes of control group students’ responses and themes of the experimental group students’ responses.

# 4.2.1. Themes of control group students’ responses

By analyzing the participants’ responses from the control group, three themes were defined: “supervised practice,” “tasks,” and “participation.”

4.2.1.1. Supervised practice. Students’ responses suggested that online practice under the supervision of the teachers was a major reason for comprehension. Responses highlighted that successful listening and reading were chiefly due to guided practice and students’ confidence that teachers were present to help. The importance of teacher support was mainly highlighted by students with low EMP proficiency. Responses suggested that the teachers’ (versus peers’) guides better simplified the procedure for doing the tasks.

4.2.1.2. Tasks. Students expressed uncertainties regarding the adequacy of their EMP proficiency to understand their needs. They believed that extending the tasks by adding visual glosses did not make tangible differences in the understanding of authentic settings. Students with higher EMP proficiency called these tasks meager as they did not provide an opportunity for practicing the skills in relation to the world.

4.2.1.3. Participation. According to the participants, the opportunity to collaborate with other students while practicing the listening and reading tasks were the helpful features that led to increased participation.

4.2.2. Themes of the experimental group students’ responses

The selected participants from the experimental group focused on the “co-verbal gesture and postures,” “commuter,” “interaction,” and “social ambiance.” However, there seemed to be differences in how robots affected students’ cognition for comprehension. This was represented through “glosses.”

4.2.2.1. Gestures and postures. Gestures and postures were the focus of participants’ responses in the robot-assisted group. The participants said that the co-verbal gestures of robots helped them easily listen and read, taking on a key role in addressing the needs, extending knowledge to understand the situations, and sharing experiences with others. The participants believed that EMP listening and reading through robots helped them gain more control over authentic settings.

4.2.2.2. Commuter. Responses showed that collaboration for practicing EMP listening and reading through robots established opportunities for professional communication. Participants said that they could easily apply their learning to practice.

4.2.2.3. Interaction. From the participants’ responses, there seemed to be a link between glossing the robot’s body and interaction with the world. Participants perceived glosses of ARs on the robot’s body as a channel for interaction with the world to understand the needs there. Comprehension of needs was attributed to glosses as ideal communication vehicles. Understanding learning needs in the fields was often attributed to the practice of content materials about the world.

4.2.2.4. Social ambiance. In the robot and robot’s AR subgroups, students’ EMP comprehension could be supported further in teamwork. Participants believed that collaborative practicing (in three-member teams) led to a supportive ambiance.

4.2.2.5. Glosses. A firm reliance on the glosses of the robot’s AR as a vehicle for understanding the academia and fields emerged in the responses of the participants from the robot’s AR group. Meanwhile, the participants with high EMP proficiency endorsed both the non-verbal gestures of the robot as well as the glosses of the AR. The simultaneous non-verbal gestures and verbal glosses in learning EMP skills through the robot’s AR helped students ponder their learning needs. The themes of the participants’ responses are shown in Table 3.

# 5. Discussion

The first purpose of this study was to examine the potential of the robot’s AR in enhancing extended embodied cognition for EMP comprehension among students whose first language is not English. In this regard, participants’ EMP listening and reading across authentic settings were assessed, along with debriefing their perspectives on the course. The results suggest that the potential of robot-assisted language learning could be augmented by incorporating AR (Han, 2010), suggesting that the cognition for EMP comprehension was enhanced under extended embodied conditions. Students’ adequate understanding of authentic settings indicates that the glossed robots may be considered a streamlined practice of EMP listening and reading, irrespective of students’ general English proficiency (Chen, 2021). Practicing EMP comprehension through robot or robot’s AR fostered the cognition underlying comprehension. Evidence for the potential of the robot and the robot’s AR highlights that the robot is the vehicle for making listening and reading more natural in the medical university. Accordingly, upon ensuring that the gestures of the robot and the augmented robot were catalyst practices, the potential of the interactive view of cognition for comprehension could be investigated.

Second, this study intended to see if students’ augmented cognition for EMP comprehension could predict their engagement in authentic settings. The results revealed that extended embodied cognition significantly affected students’ participation in learning EMP comprehension. From a theoretical view, this finding lent credence to the recent blooming of the Dual Coding Theory in educational technology-assisted ESP learning, showing how robots and ARs, as two channels of practice, enhanced students’ cognition, being themselves an ideal vehicle of communication (Buchner et al., 2022; Jakonen and Jauni, 2021).

The great potential of robot’s AR-assisted learning for extending embodied cognition in EMP classrooms is much the same as some previous studies on educational technology-assisted ESP learning (e.g., Garofoli, 2019; Sanches de Oliveira, 2022), which found that informationally rich content representation can significantly develop students’ cognition. More categorically, it complies with recent studies in ESP education, underlining the cognition in students’ outperformance in authentic settings (e.g., Collado, 2017; Nicolaidou et al., 2021).

It can be argued that augmented cognition in practicing ESP skills helps students regulate their knowledge and become more likely to be cognitively engaged in addressing their needs. Under such circumstances, students can successfully employ their ESP skills to meet the audiences’ expectations (e.g., peers, patients). They may be more directly engaged, make further efforts in their learning, work in collaboration with others, and become immersed in their learning. Shin (2017) evinced that extended cognition in practicing ESP was linked to greater scores in learning the skills. He maintained that students with higher ESP proficiency are more successful in capitalizing on ESP skills outside the learning site. Corresponding to Zhong colleagues’ (2021) findings, extending cognition in ESP learning paves the way for students to manipulate their communicative competence to puzzle out meaning, thereby leading to further consolidation of students’ ESP skills. Besides, Ellis (2019) found that practice tailored to students’ cognition could raise the adequacy of students in meeting their learning needs. The contribution of extended embodied cognition to students’ EMP listening and reading in robot-AR-assisted modules can be justified in light of the Dual Coding Theory, which emphasizes mixed modalities to establish more channels of comprehension simultaneously (Li, 2022). From this view, students’ cognition of comprehension is highly influenced not only by robot’s nonverbal features but also by their interactions with the authentic settings.

In addition, the significant interplay between cognition and students’ comprehension in academia and the professional field is partially in congruence with the results of previous research (e.g., Satori, 2022; Zheng et al., 2022), which attests the contribution of robot’s AR to the students’ competence in addressing the needs. This finding is also partially consistent with those of Ofemile (2022), who found that both embodied and extended features signify the students’ cognition in understanding the academic and professional settings. From this view, students’ miscomprehension and disengagements are linked to unsupported robot-assisted modules (Aljawarneh, 2020). The interconnection between students’ cognition and EMP comprehension skills can enhance students’ visualization while listening or reading to stimulate their knowledge toward understanding the problems in authentic settings. It is argued that constricted embodied cognition in practicing ESP listening and reading can disrupt the students’ understanding (Donnermann et al., 2022; Zhu and Katsri, 2023).

Subscribing to Collado’s (2017) social-psychological mainstream for ESP learning, students’ access to authentic settings through different modalities enhances their cognition and helps students address the needs. Aljawarneh (2020) reported that increasingly diverse media for practicing ESP skills correlates with students’ cognition and outperformance. Chen and colleagues (2022) also found that the synthetic co-verbal gestures of robots have a mediating role in improving the cognition of comprehension in university language classrooms. Moreover, significant differences in academia and fields were identified through linear mixed model analysis. The extended embodied cognition for EMP comprehension through robot’s AR showed greater potential for enhancing students’ comprehension in the healthcare fields.

The thematic analysis of the interview data revealed differences in factors relating to enhancing students’ cognition for learning EMP skills. Categories uncovered about the students’ perception of enhancing cognition in the online flipped classrooms included visual and verbal support of cognition. However, the categories achieved from the students’ responses in the robot’s (AR)-assisted flipped classrooms were relatively non-verbal. The non-verbal category appears in keeping with factors contributing to extended cognition for comprehension.

More obviously, regarding extending embodied cognition, glossing a robot is argued to facilitate students’ cognition in ESP listening and reading (Donnermann et al., 2022). Verbal and visual glosses of the ARs opened a window for students to manipulate the embodied cognition for listening and reading quickly. Likewise, a significant relationship was identified between embodied cognition and the quality of professional performance in robot-assisted language learning in higher education.

Extending the embodied cognition is believed to have reinforced students’ positive perception of the robot’s AR as a suitable practice for learning EMP listening and reading. Regarding interaction with authentic settings, practicing reading and listening through the glossed body of the robot played a central role in enhancing cognition for tackling the needs. As to the flexibility of extended embodied cognition, Zhu and Katsri (2023) found that glossing robots, ushering in successful listening and reading, significantly contribute to an adequate understanding of the world. As shown by the qualitative data, students from the robot’s AR group perceived a robust relationship with their comprehension and believed they had greater professional competence. It is alleged that visual representation of needs in conjunction with co-verbal gestures can enhance students’ perception of robot-assisted language learning and buffer against misunderstanding (Donnermann et al., 2022). In addition, the perceived advantage of being easy to visualize is consistent with the literature supporting the role of graphic representation in enhancing students’ ESP comprehension (Parmaxi, 2020).

English for Medical Purposes is a major vehicle in the medical higher education of countries where English is not widely spoken as a first language, requiring different modalities in an accurate representation of the world. To this end, a robot is viewed as a practicum for EMP education, and students are more likely to engage in hands-on learning, which in turn can result in a greater interest in taking action and learning.

# 6. Pedagogical implications

It is argued that the potential of robots should receive much more serious attention in English classrooms of medical higher education because the bodily features of robots may positively influence students’ performance (Chen et al., 2022; Hsiao et al., 2022). Extending the embodied cognition for EMP learning can support students’ professional development.

Further empirical research related to students’ cognition may help promote the quality of learning and students’ communication competence to meet audience expectations, consequently improving the effectiveness of ESP education (Hsu et al., 2022). In particular, extending the robot-assisted learning modules at EMP classrooms through educational technology can help improve students’ professional performance (Li and Lan, 2021). At last, the probability of lower ESP listening and reading proficiency of students could call for a desideratum for supporting the students’ cognition.

# 7. Limitations and suggestions for future studies

As regards the limitations of this study, first, non-English students were limited to Pakistani, Iraqi, and Iranian students who were studying at the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. Research in different medical universities in Asia and beyond examining the potential of robot’s (AR) would help validate the robot-assisted modules in ESP education. Second, the study was limited by not considering students from various medical and paramedical disciplines. Further research with samples from different academic disciplines in higher education could afford better insight into how extending the cognition of comprehension through robots affects students’ learning to address the needs.

# 8. Conclusion

Adopting a parallel design, the results of this study indicated the significance of extending embodied cognition through ARs in robot-assisted EMP learning. Formative assessment, including academic and professional assessments, may suggest that the constructs underlying the robot’s AR underscore the Dual Coding Theory. In addition, it was indicated that embodied cognition and extended cognition through the robot significantly facilitated students’ EMP listening and reading. However, the robot’s AR seemed to be a more robust module for enhancing the cognition of comprehension. Furthermore, concerning differences in the participants’ performance, it was revealed that the interaction of students with the world was more robust following practicing listening and reading skills through the robot’s AR. The qualitative data analysis suggested that the participants’ significant outperformance in robot-assisted modules could be attributed to augmented robots. It may be concluded that a more accurate representation of learning needs through robots could be generated through verbal glosses and non-verbal gestures. Glosses of augmented reality facilitated visualization of the needs in EMP classrooms where enhanced cognition of comprehension was conducive to student–student and student-patient communication, which could be intrinsically the major determinants of students’ EMP learning. It is hoped that authorities in medical higher education of Southwest Asia, and elsewhere in the world, can find workable channels to tap the unfulfilled potential of robots to facilitate communication.
