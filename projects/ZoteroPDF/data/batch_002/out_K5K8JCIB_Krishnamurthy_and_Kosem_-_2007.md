# Abstract

UK universities are accepting increasing numbers of students whose L1 is not English on a wide range of programmes at all levels. These students require additional support and training in English, focussing on their academic disciplines. Corpora have been used in EAP since the 1980s, mainly for research, but a growing number of researchers and practitioners have been advocating the use of corpora in EAP pedagogy, and such use is gradually increasing. This paper outlines the processes and factors to be considered in the design and compilation of an EAP corpus (e.g., the selection and acquisition of texts, metadata, data annotation, software tools and outputs, web interface, and screen displays), especially one intended to be used for teaching. Such a corpus would also facilitate EAP research in terms of longitudinal studies, student progression and development, and course and materials design. The paper has been informed by the preparatory work on the EAP subcorpus of the ACORN corpus project at Aston University.

# 1. EAP in the UK

UK universities are accepting increasing numbers of non-UK students on a wide range of programmes (undergraduate and postgraduate). The figures for Higher Education provided by Universities UK (2002, 2006) state that in 1994–1995, there were 163,713 nonUK students $1 0 . 5 \%$ of total student population) compared to 318,400 non-UK students ( $1 3 . 9 2 \%$ of total student population) in 2004–2005.

We cannot be sure exactly how many of the non-UK students have languages other than English as their L1, because official figures classify them by country of domicile/origin rather than by L1, but we do know that many of the non-UK students require additional support and training in English, covering all four of the core language skills (reading, writing, listening, and speaking), and focussing on their academic disciplines. At UK universities, this support and training is usually provided in the form of pre-sessional and in-sessional courses, designed both to improve the students’ language skills and to familiarise them with academic discourse, its genres, and the conventions within those genres, with specific reference to their chosen discipline.

As well as the four main language skills, these courses also need to equip the students with research skills, such as designing questionnaires and conducting interviews, and reference skills, including dictionary use and using library catalogues. However, there is often not enough time to meet all the students’ needs (Hyland, 2006, p. 74), therefore decisions about how much teaching time to allocate to each specific skill must be made during needs analysis and course design.

# 2. Corpora in EAP

# 2.1. Corpora in EAP research

A fairly loose definition of corpus will be used in this paper: ‘an electronic collection of texts.’ It is axiomatic that the texts should be accessible by appropriate linguistic software. Corpora have been used in EAP since the 1980s, but were initially used mainly for research. The first EAP corpus is generally agreed to have been the JDEST corpus, constructed by Jiao Tong University in Shanghai in 1985 (Thompson, 2006). Corpora have proved useful in determining the features of an academic register, in terms of both word frequencies and specific vocabulary (see, for example, Coxhead, 2000; Xue & Nation, 1984).

While the advent of corpora has greatly stimulated register and genre analysis, several researchers (e.g., Benesch, 2001; Dudley-Evans & St John, 1998; Flowerdew & Peacock, 2001) have recently remarked that corpora have also helped to make some earlier approaches to EAP, such as rhetorical and pragmatic analysis, become prominent again.

# 2.2. Corpora in EAP teaching

Many EAP researchers have advocated the use of corpora in the classroom (Cheng, Warren, & Xu, 2003; Cobb, 1997; Farr, 2003; Granger & Tribble, 1997; Groom, 2005; Hyland, 2006; Jordan, 1997; Lee & Swales, 2006; Nation, 2001; Schmitt, 2000; Seidlhofer, 2000; Turner, 2004). As Hyland (2006, p. 93) points out:

The value of corpus work lies in the fact that it can both replace instruction with discovery and refocus attention on accuracy as an appropriate aspect of learning. This methodology not only provides an open-ended supply of language data tailored to the learner’s needs rather than simply a standard set of examples, but also promotes a learner-centred approach bringing flexibility of time and place and a discovery approach to learning.

The successful use of corpora in the EAP classroom has been reported by several researchers (e.g., Flowerdew, 1998; Johns, 1989, 1991; Thurstun & Candlin, 1998). In particular, the data-driven learning (DDL) approach of Tim Johns (1989, 1991, 2002), who was also the co-author of MicroConcord, one of the earliest corpus software tools to become publicly available, generated considerable interest. Thurstun and Candlin (1998, p. 267), for example, describe their use of MicroConcord with the Microconcord Corpus of Academic Texts ‘‘to introduce students unfamiliar with the language of academic discourse to some of the most important, frequent and significant items of the vocabulary of academic English.’’

Despite these individual positive reports, Jarvis (2004, p. 124) commented in 2004 that corpora are not commonly used in the EAP context at HE institutions in the UK: ‘‘It appears that the value of both concordances and CD ROMs for authentic material are not widely recognised.’’

More recent research suggests that perhaps the use of corpora in EAP elsewhere is increasing, however gradually. Horst, Cobb and Nicolae (2005) state that they have used concordances, corpora, and various exercises for vocabulary learning, and these resources are freely available at www.lextutor.ca. Students at a Canadian university were used as subjects, and their vocabulary knowledge was shown to have improved. In Michigan, Lee and Swales (2006) report on a course based around the use of corpora, with participants working with WordSmith Tools and MICASE, the Hyland corpus, and an academic sub-corpus from the BNC. These participants also compiled a corpus of their own written work and compared it with the other corpora. In Australia, Cargill and O’Connor (2006) describe the use of corpus tools in workshops on academic writing in English.

# 2.3. Corpora in EAP teaching: some caveats

Some EAP researchers and practitioners value the use of corpora in research, but consider the use of corpora in an EAP classroom as more problematic. For example, Dudley-Evans and St. John (1998) say that their own students prefer the teacher to analyse and explain corpus data, rather than being asked to attempt their own deductions. They go on to argue that the teachers’ summary of the results makes the task less time-consuming. Hyland (2006, p. 93) similarly expresses scepticism about the use of corpora by students, as it requires ‘‘considerable motivation and curiosity about language which is often lacking.’’ Swales (2002) addresses the issue from his own experience of using corpora for EAP pedagogy, and says from a teacher’s perspective that the process of using corpora involves a lot of preparation time and that, even when the results seem impressive to the analyst, they may not necessarily impact as strongly on either students or colleagues.

That said, if learner autonomy is to be a genuine goal of EAP (Watson Todd, 2003, certainly suggests that it is widely advocated), and if the use of corpora can help to bring that about, it seems that we should find the time to introduce students to corpora, help them to gain basic corpus analysis skills, and thereby make them more active participants in their learning process, participants who are capable of initiating analyses on their own, even when the teacher is not around. Students who can access corpora independently will be able to do more language work on their own, and in their own time, and this will allow teachers to focus on other aspects of the course, which specifically require their presence, their interaction, or their personal guidance.

Aston (1997, p. 52), answering Owen’s (1996) concern over the use of corpora in the classroom, says that for language learning ‘‘to take place effectively in a DDL context, learners need to use corpora appropriately, and this is not just a matter of technical skills in using concordancing software. It involves selecting appropriate corpora or subcorpora to interrogate, designing appropriate queries, and appropriately interpreting the results of those queries.’’

Some scholars remind us that the case for (or against) the use of corpora in pedagogy still lacks an empirical basis; Thompson (2006, p. 15), for example, states that ‘‘empirical research into the usefulness (or not) of corpora in direct teaching’’ is required. In addition to this, one of the major problems in EAP is that many practitioners are actually involved in pursuing novel approaches, such as using corpora, but their work frequently goes unreported. As Hyland (2006, p. 5) observes, ‘‘There is substantial pedagogic and curricular activity in local contexts in EAP and a great deal of innovative practice is unsung and not widely disseminated.’’

# 3. Existing EAP corpora

Although EAP corpora as such did not emerge until the 1980s, academic discourse has always formed a part of general corpora. The one-million-word Brown corpus (Francis & Kucera, 1979) of the 1960s, for example, has a category specifically named ‘Learned,’ consisting of 80 written texts (approx. 160,000 words). The British National Corpus (BNC, 1994), which is 100 times larger, has a very similar percentage $( 1 5 . 8 \% )$ of academic texts, including some transcripts of lectures. The 2000 version of the Bank of English corpus included 6 million words of American academic textbooks (Krishnamurthy, 2001).

Attempts to classify EAP corpora (e.g., Flowerdew, 2002; Thompson, 2006) have usually grouped them into English for General Academic Purposes (EGAP) and English for Specific Academic Purposes (ESAP) corpora. However, there is a lack of agreement regarding certain corpora. For example, Flowerdew lists Jiaotong Daxue English for Science and Technology (JDEST) corpus under ESAP corpora, while Thompson puts it in his EGAP group; Flowerdew discusses learner corpora under EGAP, and Thompson offers them as a separate group altogether.

The difference in the classification criteria for EAP corpora is closely related to the nature of EGAP and ESAP. As Dudley-Evans and St John (1998, p. 41) say, ‘‘EGAP refers to the teaching of the skills and language that are common to all disciplines; ESAP refers to the teaching of the features that distinguish one discipline from others.’’

The list of EAP corpora in Table 1 is far from complete, and many ESAP corpora are not mentioned (for more exhaustive lists of ESAP corpora, see Aston, 1997; Flowerdew, 2002). The main problem with these corpora is that they are compiled by individuals who use them for their own research and do not ask for copyright permission, hence the data cannot be used by others. Another issue is funding: while large general corpus projects are usually funded for several years, EAP corpora are compiled by academics who can only afford a limited investment of time. However, the successful bids for funding made by the compilers of the BASE and BAWE corpora indicate that the national research councils in the UK have acknowledged the importance of EAP corpora in higher education.

Written corpora are easier and cheaper to compile than spoken corpora. It is therefore not surprising that written corpora, especially small ones, dominate in EAP research. While Aston (1997) sets 20,000–200,000 words as the range for the small corpora, we would argue that technological progress in the last decade has probably increased this range. Charles (2003), Gledhill (1996, 2000) and Hyland (2002) and have all exceeded the 200,000-word size despite collecting corpora purely for personal research.

The number of EAP corpora focusing on student writing is on the increase. The reasons are probably both pedagogical and practical. Pedagogically, the corpus of student writing enables researchers to examine common errors and compare the student texts with the target texts. This can then lead to the production of new teaching materials, or changes in the EAP course or curriculum. The practical reasons are more likely to be a reflection of the difficulties in obtaining published academic texts. The latest projects in compilation of academic texts written by students are the British Academic Written English (BAWE) corpus (Nesi et al., 2005), and the Michigan Corpus of Upper-level Student Papers (MICUSP), both of which are collecting student texts (awarded high grades) at both undergraduate and postgraduate level.

Learner corpora are useful for EGAP, but not necessarily for ESAP. Yukio Tono’s (2007) website (http://leo.meikai.ac.jp $^ { \prime } { \sim }$ tono/) offers an extensive overview of learner corpora that are currently available or being developed. As Granger (2003) says, the comparison of learner corpora and native-speaker corpora has produced evidence of differences in frequency patterns, and pointed out some common errors in writing made by non-native speakers. Granger lists materials design, syllabus design, language testing, and classroom methodology as four potential areas that could benefit from these findings.

Flowerdew (2002, p. 110) complained about the lack of spoken corpora for academic purposes. This is now no longer the case. The TOEFL 2000 Spoken and Written Academic Language Corpus (T2K-SWAL), the Hong Kong Corpus of Spoken English (HKCSE), the Michigan Corpus of Academic Spoken English (MICASE), the British Academic Spoken English (BASE) corpus, and the Corpus of English as Lingua Franca in Academic Settings (ELFA) (Mauranen, 2003) have been compiled in recent years. However, T2KSWAL is not publicly available, while HKCSE and ELFA are currently used for research rather than pedagogy. MICASE and BASE, built to a common design, can be accessed online (BASE through a payable corpus query system called the Sketch Engine), and complement each other in terms of representing American and British academic speech, respectively.

The variety of corpus data used in EAP is wide indeed. Written data ranges from articles, essays, theses, monographs, and textbooks, to course packs and laboratory manuals. Spoken data includes a number of different speech events, from lectures and seminars to tutorials and student presentations. The authors of texts can be lecturers or students, native or non-native speakers of English. Hence, there are substantial amounts of EAP corpus data in existence.

We have already signalled a few of the problematic issues concerning the extant data (e.g., availability, funding, etc.) but there are many others. In Section 4, we will discuss these issues in greater detail, and suggest ways in which some of these problems might be reduced or resolved, especially in relation to the use of EAP corpora for teaching.

# 4. Issues in creating a corpus for EAP pedagogy

# 4.1. Domain categories

The classification of academic subjects has always presented problems. There is a lack of consensus among academic institutions and librarians, as well as within the corpus community. As we can see from Table 2, corpus developers tend to create as few top-level categories as possible. The major differences are in assigning specific subject areas to broader categories. For example, while the Brown corpus lists Political Science (named Politics in some other classifications) in a separate category alongside Law and Education, the Dewey Decimal, the HESA Joint Academic Classification of Subjects, and the MICASE, BASE, and BAWE corpora list it under Social Sciences, or Social Sciences and Education, or Social Studies. A completely different approach is taken by the Academic Corpus (Coxhead, 2000), which puts Politics under the Arts category.

The absence of a standard classification system for EAP corpus categories forces compilers either to select one of the many existing classifications available, or to create a new classification (usually in order to reflect the institutional structure of their own university). As a consequence, potential users from other universities might encounter difficulties when using the corpus, especially for ESAP purposes. Moreover, the differences in classification systems can result in incompatibilities between EAP corpora, potentially preventing users from accessing several corpora simultaneously. This is why we should welcome the efforts of the compilers of the BASE, MICASE, and BAWE corpora who are using the same classification system. The compilers of the BAWE corpus admit their categorisation is not flawless however (Nesi et al., 2005). They list five problematic course modules, offered at the University of Warwick, that are difficult to categorize (e.g., Psychology & the Law, Physics in Medicine). Compilers of EAP corpora are likely to encounter this problem more and more, because, as Bhatia (2002, p. 27) notes, university programmes are becoming increasingly interdisciplinary.

One way of addressing the issue of classification is to localise classification to a particular EAP environment. For example, universities in the UK could adopt a joint classification system that would be designed using a bottom-up approach, perhaps using four categories: modules as a bottom-level category, then programmes, departments, and broad academic groupings as a broad-level category.

At a lower level, individual modules would form their own subcorpora that could be used for ESAP purposes, providing the EAP corpus is large enough. In existing EGAP corpora, such sub-divisions are not possible as these corpora simply do not contain enough texts from individual modules. This is one consequence of the fact that most EAP corpus projects are not sustained beyond the individual researcher’s needs. Co-operation by many universities would provide enough material to create such subcorpora. Furthermore, by following a universal classification system, other universities could contribute their own texts at any stage. This will be discussed further in Section 4.6 below.

# 4.2. Genre categories

Moore and Morton (2005, p. 49) make the general point that:

ywhilst genre as a construct is importanty it is fair to say that after several decades of intensive treatment within applied linguistic research, there is still only limited consensus about what the concept fundamentally entails.

Nevertheless, they go on to attempt a categorisation of genre based on written IELTS and university assignment tasks, which can be summarised as follows:

Case study report,   
Essay,   
Exercise,   
Experimental report,   
Literature review,   
Research report,   
Research proposal,   
Review,   
Short answer,   
Summary,   
Written argument or case, Other.

This is a useful starting point but is based only on student-produced texts. We need to see whether any useful categories are missing (e.g., draft texts as opposed to finally submitted texts), and then do a similar examination of genre categories for teacherproduced texts (such as ‘written formative feedback’) as well as ‘target texts’ (i.e., textbooks, handouts, and journal articles). As regards spoken data, the MICASE Manual (2003) classify academic speech events in the following way:

small and large lectures,   
$\bullet$ public interdisciplinary or departmental colloquia,   
$\bullet$ student presentations,   
$\bullet$ discussion sections,   
$\bullet$ seminars,   
$\bullet$ undergraduate lab sessions,   
$\bullet$ office hours,   
$\bullet$ study groups,   
$\bullet$ lab group and other meetings,   
$\bullet$ advising consultations,   
$\bullet$ dissertation defenses,   
$\bullet$ one-on-one tutorials,   
$\bullet$ interviews, campus/museum tours, service encounters.

Once again, such lists provide a useful initial basis for categorisation of corpus texts. However, some genres such as ‘recorded oral feedback’ and ‘student–teacher telephone conversations’ may be missing, and existing categories may turn out to be too broad (e.g., interviews) or too narrow (e.g., advising consultations).

The complexity of the genre classification task makes it evident that a judicious combination of external nomenclature, internal (linguistic) criteria, and informant opinions need to be taken into account, and the implementation needs to be further refined on the basis of local variables, and pragmatic decisions will need to be taken. It makes no sense to impose a priori or universal categories on such widely heterogeneous texts.

In some cases, however, the corpus designers avoid such classification problems by themselves setting limitations on the types of data collected. For example, the compilers of ICLE impose the restriction that data contributors can submit only argumentative essays (14 essay titles are suggested) or literature examination papers written by their learners (they also prescribe a word limit of 500–1000 words per text).

# 4.3. Text integrity

EAP corpora sometimes contain incomplete texts. For example, Coxhead’s Academic Corpus includes partial academic texts from the Brown, LOB and Wellington corpora. The compilers of ICLE themselves cause their texts to be incomplete, because at the dataprocessing stage, they remove all references and quotations from the texts.

Removing references and quotations from academic texts raises a serious question about the ‘authenticity’ of such texts. Has the corpus been compromised, or even corrupted? How can it still be used for pedagogic or research purposes? For example, when explaining to students how to use quotations, EAP teachers will need examples to show the typical length and type of statement that tends to be quoted, and which verbs are used to introduce (and often simultaneously to evaluate) the quoted text. Researchers also need such information when performing their analyses (e.g., Thompson & Yiyun, 1991).

# 4.4. Different levels

Some EAP corpora are restricted to data from specific levels of EAP, such as the Reading Academic Text (RAT) corpus: ‘‘The initial corpus, running to nearly a million words of text, was composed of twenty research articles written by Reading University academic staff, and a small set of PhD theses’’. Similarly, MICUSP will collect only from 4th year undergraduates to 3rd year graduate students.

A comprehensive EAP corpus should include the types of texts that students are expected to produce, as well as the types of texts they are expected to read and understand. This means that the corpus should contain texts produced by students at all levels, on pre-sessional and insessional courses, Junior Year Abroad courses, undergraduate courses, and postgraduate courses (taught and research). Additionally, it should also include journal articles and academic books, but such publications are unfortunately often subject to strict copyright restrictions.

# 4.5. All grades

Some EAP corpora contain only student texts that have been awarded high grades (e.g., BAWE, MICUSP). However, without lower-grade student texts, there is no opportunity for monitoring progression, or for making comparisons with the higher-grade student writing. And after all, the students receiving lower grades are precisely the ones that require more EAP input/help, and that we should be more concerned with. While the higher-grade texts might be sufficient for lower-grade students wishing to improve their individual performances, the collection of lower-grade texts is essential for their teachers, who need to assess generic problems and failures and may need to address wider issues such as the EAP course content, the teaching materials, and the teaching and learning strategies. The initial intuitions obtained from manual inspection of individual lower-grade texts can be supplemented by quantitative analysis of the corpus.

# 4.6. Data collection

Published texts are relatively easy to acquire, especially if they are available in electronic form, but copyright permission is often very difficult to obtain. Publishers and authors are reluctant to grant copyright permission to corpus compilers who wish to make their corpora more widely available, because academic books and journal articles can remain topical for a long time. One way of countering the anxieties of copyright owners may be by stressing that data will only be displayed in small extracts, e.g., one or two sentences.

Student texts not only share the problem of copyright permission, but are generally more difficult to obtain. As Nesi et al. (2005, p. 18) realized, ‘‘the collection of the texts was likely to be one of the more time consuming and potentially frustrating processes in the construction of the corpus.’’

Although published academic texts are obvious target texts for EAP, one could argue that Ph.D. theses are equally suitable for EAP corpora, since most EAP students will not continue in higher education beyond that level. Students wishing to become members of university academic staff, and needing to publish their work on a regular basis, will find particular benefit in a corpus focussed on journal articles and textbooks. However, all students (whatever their career intentions) will need to be able to read and understand such texts.

For EAP teaching, a corpus should consist of student texts of all levels. The research so far points to a much better success rate of obtaining student texts when academic staff are also corpus compilers (Charles, 2003; Howarth, 1998; Samraj, 2004; Thompson, 2005). They are in a much better position not only to present corpus work but also to answer any queries.

BAWE is the largest EAP corpus project currently in progress, and therefore deserves closer attention. Nesi et al. (2005, p. 11) highlight the following three main issues:

1. the need to promote the project to the right people to ensure a supply of texts that meet our criteria,   
2. the need to provide a level of monetary incentive that ensures that the corpus can be collected within a reasonable timeframe and budget, and   
3. the need to make the collection process both efficient and as user friendly as possible.

The first issue is common to any corpus project that extends beyond a researcher’s own department, as academic staff and students from other departments are less likely to share the enthusiasm about the corpus work, or to be convinced of its potential. EAP corpus compilers should be prepared to explain many times what a corpus is and how it can benefit the students. While good relationships with other departments are vital, in large universities this can sometimes be an almost impossible task. Corpus development therefore depends to a considerable extent on successful promotion.

Paying students for their texts may initially seem to be a sensible strategy, as one of the common complaints from students is their lack of money. However, this means that a large proportion of funding needs to be allocated for this purpose. Online submission is an efficient collection strategy, but becomes less user-friendly if it needs to be followed up separately by the process of obtaining signed consent forms, and making the associated payments. Students will become reluctant to submit their work if the administrative practices are too complicated.

Our recent experience of collecting student texts at Aston University has some immediate relevance. Initially, students were contacted directly, or through their lecturers. However, the success rate of this approach was rather low, so a new approach was considered. Timing was felt to be one of the main factors in the successful collection of student texts. Attempts to contact the students immediately after they received their marks for the essays were largely unsuccessful. Once students have completed their academic responsibilities for the term or year, they do not want to think of any university-related matters. Students who get lower marks than they expected are demoralised, and have little interest in helping staff projects. Therefore, students are now asked for permission only once, at the beginning of the academic year, before they have produced any texts, but the permission covers all the texts they will produce during their time at Aston.

# 4.7. Availability

EAP corpora, like EAP courses, are often intended only for intra-institutional use. An example of this is the Reading Academic Text corpus, which is only available internally. Unfortunately, this means that there is little sharing of best practice, little institutional cooperation, and considerable duplication of effort. Even corpora that are more readily available, for example via the Web, may have interfaces that are not appropriate for use in EAP. For example the BASE corpus is currently accessible via the Sketch Engine software, which is more research-oriented than pedagogic (although an alternative, simpler interface is now being developed).

Many corpora are collected for personal research, and are never used again. Several valuable resources are created (e.g., T2K-SWAL) but not made available to the public at all. So, although we stated our impression that the use of corpora for pedagogical purposes in EAP has generally increased over the past decade, it seems that, in many cases, corpora are created by individuals rather than by institutions, and only for specific groups of students (i.e., ESAP corpora).

# 4.8. Metadata

Burnard (2004) offers the following definition of ‘metadata’: ‘‘the kind of data that is needed to describe a digital resource in sufficient detail and with sufficient accuracy for some agent to determine whether or not that digital resource is of relevance to a particular enquiry.’’

In general, the metadata tends to be rather haphazard, and only collected when it suits the researcher’s needs.

However, MICASE offers the following systematic categories of metadata at the website:

Speech Event   
Academic Division   
Academic Discipline   
Participant Level   
Primary Discourse Mode   
Gender   
Age Range   
Academic Pos/Role   
Native Speaker Status   
First Language

For discussions of Speech Event see Section 4.2 and for Academic Division see Section 4.1. The other categories of metadata are relatively uncontentious (the Age Ranges seem rather arbitrary, but may be correlated with Academic Position or Participant Level). The definition of Near Native Speaker (Non-native speakers who consider English as their current dominant language and who appear to have native-like fluency and grammatical proficiency) seems likely to be problematic.

The EAP corpus creator should decide in advance what metadata is required, with a clear idea of what value the metadata may have for corpus users, and be aware that it is difficult to recover the information later (e.g., after students have left the university).

# 4.9. Software tools and user interface

Twenty years ago, corpora focussed mainly on ESP rather than EAP, and the main function of the software was to generate concordances (so much so that most corpus programmes were called concordancers, a name now often mis-applied to the new generation of corpus software). Concordances were simple and well suited to pedagogy as well as to research. However, as research forged ahead, more and more functionalities were added to the software (sorting, lemmatization, part-of-speech querying, collocation, etc.), and programmes became more research-oriented and less user-friendly to students and teachers.

The compilation of corpora and the design of suitable software are rarely effected at the same time, or on the same data. Nowadays, EAP practitioners may be able to compile corpora more easily, but they usually need to use the available (research-oriented) software, such as WordSmith Tools, AntConc, Sketch Engine, etc. to analyse and display their data. However, such programs were not designed for teaching purposes. The most important part of the EAP corpus system is the user interface, yet most current systems are research-oriented, with complicated query language, search and screen displays which are often user-unfriendly, overcrowded with information and unexplained terminology, and bewildering arrays of words and numbers.

The MICASE corpus has its own query interface, but it is often less user-friendly. There are many options which can be selected—or need to be selected—before the user proceeds to the concordance or other output display. Beginners and experts share the same interface, but little allowance is made for the first-time user or the naı¨ ve linguist. Help files—where present—are geared towards the advanced user, with complex instructions couched in technical terminology.

Fig. 1. Chart display in View for argue (http://view.byu.edu/).

Aston (1997, p. 52), talking about language learners in general, reminds us of the importance of ‘‘selecting appropriate corpora or subcorpora to interrogate, designing appropriate queries, and appropriately interpreting the results of those queries.’’ For EAP pedagogy in particular, software tools need to be relatively straightforward, with simple sequential choices rather than simultaneous multiple choices. There should be constant reminders as to what the displays mean, and why they may be of interest; suggestions about what to notice, and what to do next; easy transfer from files which the user is reading or writing; the ability to save displays to be re-examined or modified later; different levels of access for beginners and experienced users, so that beginners can train on simpler options and search paths and receive smaller sample outputs until they are more familiar with the software system.

A pedagogically oriented system will need to be much more flexible, self-explanatory, and customizable to individual learning and teaching preferences. The interface also needs to be customizable in terms of screen colours, fontsize, etc., so that each user feels comfortable with it, and the linguistic features they are investigating are suitably highlighted. More visual displays such as charts and diagrams should perhaps be offered (to offer yet another dimension of displaying language data). A good example of this is Mark Davies’s View interface (http://view.byu.edu/) (Fig. 1).

The same software should be available to run both on the EAP corpus, and on usercreated corpora, which may consist of their own writing (for comparison with a reference corpus), or data collections assembled for project work, and so on.

Careful piloting is crucial for the successful introduction of corpus-based teaching approaches into the EAP curriculum. The opinion of EAP teachers is particularly important, as they need to be comfortable when using corpus data, and if they are not enthusiastic about its use in a classroom, it is less likely they will promote corpus use to their students.

# 5. Conclusion

The one thing that EAP seems to lack is a corpus that includes all levels of data—from pre-sessional students’ writing and speech to academic lectures, Ph.D. theses, and published research articles and books. Such a corpus would need to include as many disciplines as possible, with sufficient detailed categorisation to enable the users (teachers or students) to select a customised set of corpus texts appropriate for their needs. If new corpora are created to agreed common designs, they could be accessed together, forming a richer and more extensive resource. The resulting corpus would need a user-friendly interface that is specifically designed for pedagogical use rather than for research.

The user-friendliness of the interface would enable the EAP corpus to be used by teachers on the pre-sessional and in-sessional courses. The interface will also reduce the time that needs to be spent on teaching staff and students how to use the corpus. The use of the EAP corpus data by students will foster learner autonomy and allow them to compare their own writing with target texts. Teachers will be able to use the corpus to prepare teaching materials, and by documenting their practice, we will be able to develop a more strategic approach to corpus-informed teaching.

Corpora offer the opportunity to conduct empirical research in almost every aspect of EAP pedagogic activity. The analyses of EAP students’ writing will help to provide researchers with more information about the students in terms of their general academic development, their gradual mastery of topics, themes, subjects, and so on, and the development in their academic writing style.
