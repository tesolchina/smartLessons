# ABSTRACT

The present study compared bilingualism with bidialectalism in their respective impact on executive control, using a short-term language switching training paradigm for participants who were both bidialectals (Shanghainese-Mandarin Chinese) and bilinguals (Chinese-English). Twenty participants were assigned to a control group where no language switching was involved. Another twenty participants were assigned to an experimental group where language-switching training was applied in two ways: bidialectal-switching between Shanghainese and Mandarin Chinese, and bilingual-switching between Mandarin and English. Their executive control ability was tested via a Simon task before and after each type of language training. The results showed that bilingual switching could involve better executive control and subsequently led to better performance on the Simon task than bidialectal switching. Therefore, the association between language switching control and domain-general executive control could be affected by the languages involved in switching, thus shedding further light on the relations between linguistic and non-linguistic control mechanisms.

# 1. Introduction

The relations between bilingualism, bidialectalism and executive control abilities have attracted an increasing amount of research attention. To date, no consensus has been reached and the topic is still under heated debate. The present study was aimed to contribute to this line of research by examining the impact of bilingualism and bidialectalism respectively on executive control performance through a short-term language switching training paradigm.

# 1.1. Bilingualism and executive control

Bilinguals are constantly tasked with selecting and monitoring lexical items from two languages daily (Green and Abutalebi 2013). Therefore, understanding how to effectively manage these languages without interference has emerged as a central focus in bilingualism research (Calabria et al. 2018; Declerck and Koch 2023). Executive control thus becomes a pivotal concept in this domain, as it refers to advanced cognitive abilities that enable individuals to regulate their thoughts and behaviors to achieve goals (Green 1998).

Many studies (e.g. Calabria et al. 2012; 2015; Declerck et al. 2021) have explored the link between bilingual control and executive control. They investigated how general executive control functions overlap with bilingual language control and whether bilingualism confers advantages in executive control. Evidence from some studies has suggested a bilingual advantage across age groups in functions such as inhibition (Costa et al. 2009) and switching (Wiseheart, Viswanathan, and Bialystok 2016). For example, bilinguals tend to outperform monolinguals in the Simon task (Bialystok, Martin, and Viswanathan 2005), one of the mostly commonly used nonverbal tasks to test one’s executive control (Simon and Rudell 1967). Studies on young bilingual adults (e.g. Desideri and Bonifacci 2018) have reported that bilinguals had faster reaction time and better use of altering cues during switching compared with monolinguals. Similar evidence has also been found in ChineseEnglish bilinguals (e.g. Liu et al. 2016). The bilingual advantage is primarily associated with the frequent need for bilinguals to resolve conflicts between two languages to ensure a smooth processing of the target language (Green and Abutalebi 2013). This demand necessitates effective control over lexical interference and the suppression of irrelevant language. Green’s (1998) Inhibition Control (IC) model provides a framework for understanding how the lexico-semantic system actively suppresses competing outputs in alignment with the speaker’s goals. Specifically, the model emphasizes the active inhibition of non-target language words to prevent unintended production, with this topdown inhibition suppressing potential activation of the non-target language.

Nevertheless, the bilingual advantage has been questioned and challenged. For instance, von Bastian, Souza, and Gade (2016) did not find a significant bilingual advantage in executive control tasks after controlling for factors such as proficiency, age of acquisition, and language usage. Paap and Greenberg (2013) used a wide range of executive control tasks on young adult bilinguals but did not find a significant effect of bilingualism, and they even found that monolinguals outperformed bilinguals in some ways, leading to the conclusion that bilingualism does not necessarily affect executive functions.

# 1.2. Language similarity: the effect of bidialectalism

Language similarity is a relatively understudied but crucial factor influencing the impact of bilingualism on executive control (Oschwald et al. 2018). The degree of language similarity, such as language distance, may affect bilinguals’ language production regulation and executive control involvement (Oschwald et al. 2018). Bidialectalism, where individuals are fluent in both a standard1 language and a regional dialect, provides an intriguing opportunity to explore the effects of language similarity. Studying bidialectal speakers can offer insights into how similarities and differences between dialects and standard language influence language processing (Liu and Escudero 2023).

Limited but growing research on bidialectalism suggests a potential bidialectal advantage in executive control. Antoniou et al. (2016) observed advantages in the Simon task among CypriotStandard Greek bidialectal children compared with monolinguals. Poarch, Vanhove, and Berthele (2019) found better executive control in those using a non-standard German dialect more often than the balanced German-Swabian speakers. Nevertheless, some studies have found no bidialectal advantage. Kirk et al. (2014) compared monolingual, bilingual (Gaelic-English), and bidialectal (Dundonian Scots-English) speakers in executive control via a Simon task, and found no significant differences between them. Similarly, Scaltritti, Peressotti, and Miozzo (2017) found no notable distinctions in the performance of Italian-Venetian bidialectals and Italian monolinguals on a flanker task. Ross and Melinger (2017) found no bidialectal advantage in executive functions compared with bilinguals and monolinguals.

The above mixed findings about bidialectalism’s impact on executive control are reminiscent of the relations between bilingualism and executive control. Some studies suggest that bidialectals and bilinguals could be similar in lexical control, as seen in Kirk et al. (2022) comparing Scottish Standard English (SSE) and Orcadian Scots speakers, and Vorwerg, Suntharam, and Morand (2019) where Swiss German and Standard German speakers were compared. However, Poarch, Vanhove, and Berthele (2019) suggest bidialectals may differ from bilinguals due to more frequent and regular switching between dialects in daily life. Studies using a cross-dialect translation paradigm (e.g. Melinger 2021) have highlighted distinctions between dialects and languages. In Melinger’s (2018) research, Scottish bidialectals showed different control compared with bilinguals. Scaltritti, Peressotti, and Miozzo (2017) noted no significant dialect effect on executive control in Italian–dialect speakers, in contrast to the noticeable linguistic effects on executive control among Catalan-Spanish bilinguals. These findings suggest that inhibiting a dialect may differ from inhibiting a language, leading to distinct inhibition patterns in bidialectalism and bilingualism (Melinger 2018).

# 1.3. Short-term language switching training

Some studies (e.g. Kang et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2019; Timmer, Calabria, and Costa 2019) have investigated whether short-term language-switching training influences domain-general executive control abilities, due to the potential link between bilingual language switching and domain-general task switching mechanisms (Prior and Gollan 2011). The language-switching task, widely used to explore language control mechanisms (e.g. Costa, Santesteban, and Ivanova 2006; Timmer, Calabria, and Costa 2019), involves a switch cost, measured by differences in response times or accuracy/error rates between switching and non-switching conditions. Studies have consistently revealed an asymmetry in switch costs, i.e. switching into the first language (L1) has a greater cost than switching into the second language (L2).This aligns with the Inhibitory Control model (Green 1998), suggesting that suppressing the dominant language (e.g. L1) is more challenging (Costa, Santesteban, and Ivanova 2006; de Bruin, Bak, and Della Sala 2015).

A positive relation between short-term language switching training and domain-general executive control has been reported in certain cases. For example, Timmer, Calabria, and Costa (2019) demonstrated that short-term language-switching training enhanced performance in linguistic and non-linguistic tasks, indicating improved domain-general, non-linguistic executive control. This effect was similarly observed in Chinese-English bilinguals (Kang et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2019), where short-term language-switching training improved proactive control and language control efficiency (Kang et al. 2017). However, evidence also exists for the limited transfer between language switching training and executive control performance. For example, Prior and Gollan (2013) showed that the training effects of language switching were found in the non-dominant language only, suggesting that executive control may be more important for facilitating the production of the non-dominant language.

# 1.4. The present study

The above review suggests that the relation between executive control performance and bilingualism/bidialectalism is still a point of contention. In addition, it is not clear how bilinguals and bidialectals differ in terms of executive control abilities. Meanwhile, no consensus has been reached regarding whether the effect of short-term language switching training could carry over to domain-general executive control tasks.

Motivated by the above concerns, the present study aims to use the short-term language switching training paradigm to examine whether bilingualism differs from bidialectalism in their influence on executive control. Research outputs on bidialectalism can also shed light on the possible selection and control mechanisms of bilingualism, since both bilingualism and bidialectalism involve the control and monitoring of different language varieties (Antoniou et al. 2016).

In our study, we tested native Shanghai-Mandarin Chinese speakers who are also proficient in English as a second language (L2). These individuals are both bidialectal (Shanghainese and Mandarin Chinese), and bilingual (Chinese and English). Specifically, Mandarin is considered the standard language as it is China’s official language, used nationwide in education, media, and government. Conversely, Shanghainese belongs to the Wu family of Chinese dialects, and is primarily spoken in Shanghai and its surrounding areas (Ho 2003).

Participants in our study received two conditions of language-switching training: bidialectalswitching between Shanghainese and Mandarin Chinese, and bilingual-switching between Mandarin and English (detailed in section 2). Before and after the language-switching training, the participants performed a Simon task to test their executive control abilities.

We hypothesized that the bilingual switching training would lead to better performance on the executive control (Simon) task than the bidialectal switching training. This is because switching between closely related languages (e.g. two dialects) may not necessitate substantial cognitive efforts, due to the potential facilitation between highly and moderately related language pairs (e.g. Catalan and Spanish) (Costa, Miozzo, and Caramazza 1999). Consequently, this might decrease the likelihood of substantial improvements in executive control (Kirk et al. 2014; Ross and Melinger 2017; Scaltritti, Peressotti, and Miozzo 2017).

# 2. Methods

# 2.1. Participants

Forty native speakers of Shanghainese and Mandarin who learned English as an L2 participated in the present study. The participants were second and third-year university students in Shanghai, recruited via posters and social media platforms. They all passed the nationwide English proficiency test for Chinese college students, College English Test-Band 4 (CET-4) (full score $= 7 1 0$ ; pass score $=$ 425). They were randomly assigned to the control group $( N = 2 0$ , 10 females) or the experimental group $N = 2 0$ , 10 females).

They completed a questionnaire about their language proficiency, language use frequency and social-economic background. They rated their proficiency in Shanghainese, Mandarin and English on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 10 (very good). Their language dominance was assessed via a questionnaire about their language use frequency for the three languages on a scale of 1 (no use at all) to 10 (extremely frequent use). Results revealed the highest proficiency and usage frequency for Shanghainese, followed by Mandarin, while English showed the lowest scores (Table 1). One-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed no significant proficiency difference between Shanghainese and Mandarin $( F \left( 1 , 3 9 \right) = 0 . 5 6$ , $p = 0 . 4 6 )$ . However, English proficiency was significantly lower than Shanghainese $( F ~ ( 1 , ~ 3 9 ) = 1 7 3 . 2 9$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ) and Mandarin $( F ~ ( 1 , ~ 3 9 ) = 1 3 8 . 9 5 ,$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1 .$ ). Additionally, significant usage frequency differences were found between Shanghainese and Mandarin $F$ (1, $3 9 ) = 4 9 . 7 $ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ), as well as between Mandarin and English $( F \ ( 1 , \ 3 9 ) = 1 4 0 2 . 4 5$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ), suggesting a hierarchy of language dominance: Shanghainese $>$ Mandarin $>$ English. Socio-economic status was gauged by parental education level (rated 1 to 7, $1 =$ limited literacy, $7 =$ doctoral degree). Participants also completed the Superior Scale I of the Ravens Advanced Progressive Matrices (full score $= 1 2$ ) for non-verbal intelligence. Table 1 suggests that the two groups were matched (statistically equivalent) in their background and language abilities. The study received ethical approval from the local ethics committee.

# 2.2. Materials and procedure

The experiment consisted of a language training session and a non-linguistic, executive control (Simon) task performed before and after the language training session.

# 2.2.1. Language training

Participants were randomly assigned to either the control group (20 participants), which received single-block (non-switching) language training, or the experimental group (20 participants), which received language-switching training. Similar to Timmer, Calabria, and Costa (2019), the control group named black-and-white line pictures of objects (Snodgrass and Vanderwart 1980) in one language per block: Shanghainese, Mandarin and English respectively, such that the participants used only one language (i.e. no switching) within a block. There were 3 language blocks $\yen 32$ trials each $= 9 6$ trials in total for the control group. Pictures were presented once, and block order was counterbalanced across participants.

The experimental group named the same pictures as the control group but performed two language-switching training sessions. One session involved bidialectal (Shanghainese and Mandarin) switching and the other session bilingual (Mandarin and English) switching. The order of sessions was counterbalanced, and each session comprised 96 trials divided into 4 conditions (24 trials each). For the bidialectal session, the conditions included switching from Shanghainese to Mandarin, switching from Mandarin to Shanghainese, staying between Shanghainese, and staying between Mandarin. For the bilingual session, the conditions included switching from English to Mandarin, switching from Mandarin to English, staying between Mandarin, and staying between English. Each session had 48 switching and 48 non-switching trials presented in a pseudo-random order, with one unanalyzed filler trial at the very beginning.

For each trial, the frame color (orange or green) surrounding the picture cued the target language (Shanghainese, Mandarin, English). The color assignment was counterbalanced across participants. Mandarin was consistently cued by the same color across sessions for each participant, given that Mandarin was used in both bidialectal and bilingual sessions. During each trial, a fixation cross appeared for $3 0 0 ~ \mathsf { m } \mathsf { s } _ { \iota }$ , followed by a $2 0 0 ~ \mathsf { m } s$ blank screen, and the picture with the colored frame stayed on-screen for $3 0 0 0 ~ \mathrm { { m s } }$ before the next trial appeared. The inter-trial interval was $2 5 0 0 ~ \mathsf { m s }$ (see Figure 1). Participants needed to promptly and accurately name each picture in the language cued by the frame color, and vocal responses were recorded and coded for accuracy. Participants were permitted breaks during training, and each training session lasted around fifteen minutes. Participants were immediately tested on the Simon task (detailed below) after language switching training.

# 2.2.2. Simon task

Following previous studies (e.g. Bialystok, Craik, and Luk 2008), the present study used a Simon arrow task to examine executive control abilities. During each trial, a fixation cross was displayed for 300 ms, followed by a $2 0 0 ~ \mathsf { m } s$ blank screen. Then a white arrow together with a fixation cross were presented against a black background for 3000ms before the next trial appeared. The pointing direction of the arrow was either congruent (i.e. matching) or incongruent (i.e. mismatching) with the side of the fixation cross on the screen (Figure 2). Participants needed to respond as quickly as possible by pressing a key either on the left or right side of a keyboard according to the arrow pointing direction. The number of trials for congruent and incongruent conditions was equal (60 trials for each condition), presented in a pseudo-random order. The Simon task was performed before and after the language switching training to facilitate examination of training effectiveness.

# 2.3. Data analysis

For the cued-language switching training and the Simon task, reaction time and error rates were analysed using linear mixed-effects models with the lme4 package of R (Bates et al. 2014). Switch costs were computed as the difference in reaction time between switch and non-switch trials of the language-switching task. The Simon effect was calculated as the difference in reaction time between incongruent and congruent conditions of the Simon task: the smaller the Simon effect, the better the Simon task performance, indicating a better ability to suppress interference (de Bruin, Bak, and Della Sala 2015).

# 3.1.1. RT

Table 2 displays descriptive statistics for reaction times (RTs) in various conditions across the experimental and control group. Figure 3 illustrates mean RTs for bidialectal and bilingual sessions in the experimental group. A linear mixed-effects model (Table 3) revealed significant fixed effects for session (bidialectal, bilingual), switch type (switch, non-switch), and language (Shanghainese, Mandarin, English), without significant interactions. Furthermore, in the bidialectal session (Table 4a), language, switch type, and their interaction were significant; whereas in the bilingual session (Table 4b), language and switch type were significant, but the interaction was not. Bidialectal RTs were significantly longer than bilingual RTs $\left( t = 2 . 4 5 \right.$ , $p = 0 . 0 1 4 ,$ ). Both bidialectal $( t = - 3 . 0 1$ , $p =$ 0.003) and bilingual $( t = - 4 . 0 5$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1 .$ ) sessions showed significantly longer RTs in switch conditions compared to non-switch conditions. Specifically, bidialectal switching from Mandarin to Shanghainese yielded a larger RT than the reverse $\left( t = 2 . 9 8 \right.$ , $p = 0 . 0 0 8 )$ ). In the bilingual session, switching from English to Mandarin resulted in a larger RT than the reverse $\left( t = 2 . 3 9 \right.$ , $p = 0 . 0 2 8 )$ . The control group’s mean RT was significantly smaller than non-switch conditions in both bilingual $( t = 2 . 7 9$ , $p = 0 . 0 0 8 )$ and bidialectal $\left( t = 3 . 3 5 \right.$ , $p = 0 . 0 0 2 )$ sessions of the experimental group.

# 3.1.2. Switch costs

Table 5 displays descriptive statistics for switch costs (i.e. reaction time difference between switch and non-switch trials) in bidialectal and bilingual sessions. A Linear mixed-effects model (Table 6) showed significant fixed effects for session and language, without a significant interaction. Bidialectal switch costs were significantly larger than bilingual switch costs $\left( t = 2 . 3 8 \right.$ , $p = 0 . 0 2 8 \mathrm { , }$ ). Specifically, in the bidialectal session, switch costs in the dominant dialect Shanghainese were significantly $( t =$ 2.21, $p = 0 . 0 4 \AA$ ) larger than those in Mandarin. In the bilingual session, switch costs were larger in the dominant language Mandarin compared with English, though not statistically significant $( t = 0 . 3 1 , p$ $= 0 . 7 6 )$ .

# 3.1.3. Error rates

Table 7 shows error rates for the experimental and control group. A generalized linear mixed-effects model (Table 8) revealed a significant session effect, with no significance for language, switch type, or interactions. Particularly, the bidialectal session had a significantly higher error rate than the bilingual session $( t = 2 . 2 7$ , $p = 0 . 0 3 5$ . Table 9a and b further show the error rates for bidialectal and bilingual switching sessions respectively. In the bidialectal session, switch trials had a significantly higher error rate than non-switch trials $( t = - 2 . 3 5 , p = 0 . 0 2 )$ . Additionally, switching from Mandarin to Shanghainese had a higher error rate than the reverse, but the difference was not significant $\left( t = 0 . 6 2 \right)$ , $p =$

In the bilingual session, the switch trials still had a larger error rate than the non-switch trials, but the difference was not statistically significant either $( t = - 0 . 4 2$ , $p = 0 . 6 8 )$ . Moreover, switching from English to Mandarin resulted in a significantly higher error rate than the reverse $( t = 2 . 9 9 , p$ $= 0 . 0 0 8 )$ ). The control group had significantly lower error rates (all $p s < 0 . 0 5 )$ ) than all switching conditions of the bilingual and bidialectal sessions of the experimental group.

# 3.2. Simon task

# 3.2.1. Simon effect

The Simon effect before language switching training (Figure 4a) did not significantly differ between the experimental and control group $\left( t = 0 . 1 9 \right.$ , $p = 0 . 8 5$ ), indicating comparable performance between the two groups before the language training.

In Table 10, the Simon effect before and after language training is presented. A linear mixedeffects model (Table 11A) showed a significant fixed effect of training time (pre- vs. post-training). Specifically, for the control group, there was no significant difference between pre- and post-training $( t = 0 . 1 7$ , $p { = } 0 . 8 7 $ ). In the experimental group, bidialectal switching training showed no significant impact on the Simon effect $\left( t = 0 . 7 4 \right.$ , $p { = } 0 . 4 7 $ ), while bilingual switching training led to a significant reduction $\left( t = 3 . 9 3 \right.$ , $p = 0 . 0 0 1 $ ) in the Simon effect compared to its pre-training level. Moreover, a linear mixed effects model (Table 11B) demonstrated a significant training type effect. Specifically, after bidialectal training, the Simon effect was not significantly different from the control group (t $= 0 . 4 1$ , $p = 0 . 6 9 )$ . However, after bilingual training, the Simon effect was significantly smaller than the control $\prime = 3 . 7 5$ , $p { = } 0 . 0 0 1 $ ) and bidialectal $\mathbf { \chi } _ { t = 3 . 3 7 }$ , $p = 0 . 0 0 3 )$ training (Figure 4b).

# 3.2.2. Simon RT

Table 12 displays Simon RT descriptive statistics for different conditions in the experimental and control group. Figure 5a illustrates the pre-training comparison, and a linear mixed-effects model (Table 13A) showed a non-significant fixed effect of group. Specifically, no significant differences were observed between the experimental and control group in both congruent $\left( t = 0 . 9 1 \right.$ , $p = 0 . 3 7 )$ and incongruent trials $\left( t = 0 . 1 8 \right)$ , $p = 0 . 8 6 )$ ). For both groups, the congruent trials had smaller RT than incongruent trials. This suggests comparability in Simon RTs between the experimental and control group before language training sessions.

For the experimental group, a linear mixed-effects model showed a significant fixed effect of training time (pre- vs. post-training) (Table 13C). For congruent trials, bilingual $( t = 4 . 1 7$ , $p = 0 . 0 0 1$ ) switching training significantly reduced RTs compared with pre-training levels, while bidialectal training also led to smaller RTs than pre-training levels, but the difference was not statistically significant $\displaystyle ( t = 1 . 2 9$ , $p = 0 . 2 1$ ). For incongruent trials, bidialectal training reduced RTs compared with the pre-training level, but the difference was not significant $( t = 1 . 3 6 , p = 0 . 1 9 )$ . However, after bilingual training, RTs were significantly smaller $( t = 4 . 1 2$ , $p = 0 . 0 0 1$ ) than the pre-training level.

For the control group, a linear mixed-effects model (Table 13D) showed a significant fixed effect of congruency, while training time and the interaction were not significant. For congruent $( t = 0 . 0 7$ , $p { = } 0 . 9 5 $ ) and incongruent $\left( t = 0 . 8 7 \right.$ , $p = 0 . 3 9 $ ) trials, RTs after the control group (non-switching) training did not significantly differ from those before training, suggesting no notable RT reduction.

Figure 5b illustrates comparisons between the two groups for Simon RTs after language switching training. A linear mixed-effects model (Table 13B) showed a significant fixed effect for training type and the interaction with congruency. For congruent trials, RTs after bidialectal training were not significantly different from the control group $\left( t = 0 . 1 9 \right.$ , $p = 0 . 8 5$ ), but after bilingual training, RTs were significantly shorter than the control group $t = 2 . 5 2$ , $p = 0 . 0 1 6 ^ { \prime }$ ). For incongruent trials, both bidialectal $t = 2 . 6 0$ , $p = 0 . 0 1 3 \mathrm { , }$ ) and bilingual $( t = 4 . 2 0$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ) training resulted in significantly shorter RTs compared with the control group. Additionally, RTs after bilingual training were significantly shorter than after bidialectal training for both congruent $\prime { t } = 3 . 3 3$ , $p = 0 . 0 0 4 \mathrm { , }$ and incongruent $( t = 2 . 2 0$ , $p =$ 0.04) trials.

# 3.2.3. Error rates

Table 14 presents error rates descriptive statistics for various conditions in the experimental and control group. A generalized linear mixed-effects model (Table 15A) indicated that before language switching training, the fixed effects of group, congruency, and their interaction were not significant. No statistically significant differences were found between the experimental and control group in both congruent $\mathbf { \chi } ( t = 0 . 2 7$ , $p { = } 0 . 7 9 $ ) and incongruent trials $\scriptstyle ( t = 0 . 4 0$ , $p { = } 0 . 7 0 $ ). Both groups showed smaller error rates in congruent trials than incongruent trials. These results suggest comparability between the two groups in error rates before language training sessions.

In both congruent and incongruent trials, bidialectal and bilingual switching training significantly reduced error rates compared with pre-training levels (Congruent: bidialectal $t = 4 . 5 7$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ , bilingual $t = 8 . 1 7$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ; Incongruent: bidialectal $t = 3 . 0 4$ , $p { = } 0 . 0 0 7$ , bilingual $t = 5 . 2 1$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ).

For the control group, a generalized mixed-effects model (Table 15D) indicated non-significant fixed effects for training time, congruency, and their interaction. Error rates for congruent $( t =$ 1.14, $p = 0 . 2 7 $ ) and incongruent $\prime = 0 . 3 2$ , $p { = } 0 . 7 5$ ) trials after control group (non-switching) training did not significantly differ from pre-training levels, suggesting no notable reduction in error rates.

Regarding error rates after language switching training, a generalized linear mixed-effects model (Table 15B) showed significant fixed effects for training type, congruency and their interaction. For congruent trials, bidialectal $\left( t = 2 . 3 3 \right.$ , $p = 0 . 0 2 5$ ) and bilingual $( t = 2 . 8 3$ , $p { = } 0 . 0 0 7 $ training led to significantly smaller error rates than the control group. For incongruent trials, bidialectal training did not significantly differ from the control group $\left( t = 0 . 7 8 \right.$ , $p = 0 . 4 4 ^ { \cdot }$ ), while bilingual training resulted in significantly smaller error rates than the control group $( t = 4 . 1 2$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ). Additionally, bilingual training showed significantly smaller error rates than bidialectal training for both congruent $\left( t = 3 . 3 2 \right)$ , $p = 0 . 0 0 4 )$ and incongruent $( t = 3 . 5 7$ , $p = 0 . 0 0 2 )$ ) trials.

# 3.2.4. Relations between language switch costs and Simon effect

Linear regression analyses showed that there was a significantly negative relation between the Simon effect and the switch costs in the dominant languages: Shanghainese in the bidialectal session $[ \beta = - 0 . 1 2 , t ( 1 8 ) = - 3 . 6 9$ , $p = 0 . 0 0 2 ]$ (Figure 6a), and Mandarin in the bilingual session $[ \beta =$ $- 0 . 2 5$ , t $( 1 8 ) = - 2 . 3 3$ , $p = 0 . 0 3 2 ]$ (Figure 6b), suggesting that the switch costs in the dominant languages negatively predicted the Simon effect. No significant correlation was found between the Simon effect and the switch costs in the less dominant languages: Mandarin in the bidialectal session $[ \beta = - 0 . 0 8 8$ , t $( 1 8 ) = - 1 . 9 8$ , $p = 0 . 0 6 3 ]$ , and English in the bilingual session $[ \beta = - 0 . 0 1 3 , ~ i$ t $( 1 8 ) = - 0 . 1 5$ , $p = 0 . 8 9 ]$ .

# 4. Discussion

In the present study, we compared bilingualism with bidialectalism in terms of their respective impact on executive control (via a Simon task) using a short-term language training paradigm for participants who were both bidialectals (Shanghai-Mandarin Chinese) and bilinguals (ChineseEnglish). The results showed both similarities and differences in the effect of bidialectal and bilingual switching training, detailed below.

# 4.1. Language switching: bidialectal vs. bilingual

In terms of similarities, the switch trials in both the bidialectal and bilingual switching training had longer RTs and higher error rates than non-switch trials, consistent with previous studies (e.g. Costa, Santesteban, and Ivanova 2006; Linck, Schwieter, and Sunderman 2012). The reason, based on the Inhibitory Control model (Green 1998), is that during language switching the non-target language is inhibited in the previous trial and reactivated in the present trial, which means the target language needs to be released from its inhibition in the previous trial, resulting in longer RTs and higher error rates.

In addition, the dominant language (i.e. Shanghainese in the bidialectal condition; Mandarin in the bilingual condition) had longer RTs, higher error rates, larger switch costs in either the bidialectal or bilingual session. Moreover, the switch costs in the dominant languages negatively predicted the Simon effect, indicating that the more the participants inhibited their dominant language (as reflected in the larger switch costs in the dominant language), the smaller the Simon effect, suggesting better inhibition in executive control and hence better performance in the Simon task. This is consistent with previous findings (e.g. de Bruin, Bak, and Della Sala 2015; Li et al. 2021) which showed a negative correlation between the Simon effect and switch costs to the dominant language. The results align with the Inhibitory Control model (Green 1998), indicating that inhibiting the dominant language is more challenging, requiring greater inhibition than the non-dominant language. This is because using the dominant language demands minimal inhibition for the less activated non-dominant language. However, when communicating in the non-dominant language, strong inhibition of the dominant language becomes crucial to effectively suppress its activation and to ensure accurate usage of the non-dominant language (Costa and Santesteban 2004; Declerck, Kleinman, and Gollan 2020). This heightened inhibition demands more time to reactivate the inhibited dominant language, resulting in longer reaction times for the dominant language in language switching tasks (e.g. Costa and Santesteban 2004). This gives rise to asymmetrical switch costs, i.e. switching to the more dominant language is more difficult than switching to the less dominant one. Additionally, greater switch costs for the dominant language suggest that more inhibitory control is applied to mitigate interference from the dominant language, facilitating the switch to the non-dominant language (Bobb and Wodniecka 2013; Costa and Santesteban 2004). In this study, stronger inhibition on the dominant language leads to enhanced nonverbal inhibitory control in the Simon task. This aligns with the findings that language control and domain-general executive control ability are associated, suggesting that individuals with better language control could also have enhanced domain-general executive control (Bialystok, Martin, and Viswanathan 2005; Costa et al. 2009; Green and Abutalebi 2013).

The similarities reported above provide further evidence that in both bidialectal and bilingual switching, inhibitory control mechanisms are involved for lexical selection from different languages or language varieties (e.g. dialects), in line with previous findings that bidialectal switching could be comparable to bilingual switching in terms of monitoring and control (Kirk et al. 2018; Vorwerg, Suntharam, and Morand 2019). The results could further suggest that the same concept may trigger coactivation of its lexical representations not only in different languages but also in different dialects, for which effective inhibition of the non-target language/dialect is required to facilitate smooth production in the target linguistic context (Kirk et al. 2018; Vorwerg, Suntharam, and Morand 2019). Therefore, the many-to-one mapping between lexical representations and a concept may require an extension of the Inhibitory Control model (Green 1998) to accommodate the lexical control for different language varieties such as dialects (Vorwerg, Suntharam, and Morand 2019).

On the other hand, the present study has also shown differences between bidialectal and bilingual switching, with bidialectal switching showing longer RTs, larger switch costs, and higher error rates than bilingual switching. These findings align with prior research (Ross and Melinger 2017; Scaltritti, Peressotti, and Miozzo 2017) and suggest that bidialectal switching may involve poorer executive control compared with bilingual switching. The reason could be that bidialectals usually switch between two dialects more frequently due to the widespread usage of both dialects in their daily life (Poarch, Vanhove, and Berthele 2019). This could potentially reduce the demand for heightened executive control or close monitoring when dealing with two closely related language varieties/dialects (Melinger 2018; Ross and Melinger 2017). The reduced pressure to exert more control and monitoring in bidialectal contexts may result in an insufficient advantage in executive control and poorer performance in language-switching tasks (Ross and Melinger 2017). Conversely, managing two distinct languages necessitates a higher extent of control, primarily because the differences in linguistic features, such as vocabulary and phonetics, require increased monitoring effort. As a result, this enhanced control and monitoring may contribute to better performance in language-switching tasks (Oschwald et al. 2018).

# 4.2. The effect of bilingual vs. bidialectal training on executive control

The present study showed that in the experimental group, both bidialectal and bilingual training reduced the Simon effect, RTs and error rates for both congruent and incongruent trials compared with pre-training levels. Nevertheless, the reductions in the Simon effect and RTs were significant after bilingual training, but non-significant after bidialectal training. In the control group, the nonswitching single-block language training had no significant impact on the Simon effect, RTs or error rates across trial types. Moreover, bilingual training yielded significantly smaller Simon effect, shorter RTs, and lower error rates across congruent and incongruent trials compared with bidialectal and control group training.

Together, the above findings suggest that the bilingual switching training could significantly influence nonverbal inhibitory control abilities reflected in the Simon task. This is consistent with previous studies which showed that bilingual switching training can carry over to non-linguistic executive control tasks (e.g. Liu et al. 2019; Timmer, Calabria, and Costa 2019), indicating a possible shared mechanism between bilingual language control and executive control (Green 1998; Green and Abutalebi 2013; Timmer, Calabria, and Costa 2019).

On the other hand, although the bidialectal switching training also led to reduced Simon effect, RTs, and error rates compared with pre-training levels, the training effect was statistically significant only for error rates across both congruent and incongruent trials, with no significant impact observed for the Simon effect or RTs in either trial type. Therefore, bilingual switching training has overall better effects than bidialectal switching on enhancing executive control. This underscores that the impact of language switching training on executive control performance is influenced by the languages involved. When the two language varieties in switching training are more closely related (e.g. bidialectal switching), the training effect tends to be less robust. Consequently, it may not be as impactful as switching between two distinct languages (e.g. bilingual switching) for significantly improving overall performance in subsequent non-linguistic executive control tasks.

The findings align with prior research (Kirk et al. 2014; Ross and Melinger 2017; Scaltritti, Peressotti, and Miozzo 2017) which indicated that transitioning between close language varieties or dialects may not consistently confer advantages across all facets of executive control. The reason is related to the marginal differences between the close language varieties, which may not necessarily demand substantial cognitive efforts during switching. This could be due to the potential facilitation between highly and moderately related language pairs (Costa, Miozzo, and Caramazza 1999), which may reduce the likelihood of significant improvements in executive control (Kirk et al. 2014; Ross and Melinger 2017; Scaltritti, Peressotti, and Miozzo 2017). In contrast, when distinct languages are involved, enhanced executive control becomes necessary for monitoring language production due to significant differences in phonetics and lexicon. This increased demand is likely to foster more robust linguistic and non-linguistic control (Oschwald et al. 2018; Prior and Gollan 2013).

For a comprehensive understanding of the link between L1 dialect, L2 switching, and executive control, future research could also explore Shanghainese-English switching. Additionally, refining the control group design to include two sessions, each focusing on different language pairs (e.g. Shanghainese and Mandarin for one session; Mandarin and English for the other session), would allow for a more thorough comparison with the experimental group. Moreover, the present study does not directly address the question of whether inherent cognitive process differences exist between bilingual and bidialectal control. Answering this question necessitates a more systematic and thorough investigation in the future, with diverse behavioral and neuroimaging methods such as EEG and fMRI.

# 5. Conclusion

The present study contributes to the debate on the relations between linguistic and domain-general executive control abilities from the perspective of how executive control can be influenced by bilingualism and bidialectalism respectively through the lens of a short-term language switching training paradigm. The results showed that bilingual switching training led to better performance on the executive control task than the bidialectal switching training, suggesting that for multilingual speakers, switching between two distinct languages may involve better executive control than switching between two closely related language varieties. This further indicates that the connection between domain-general executive control mechanism and language switching control could be dependent on the languages involved.
