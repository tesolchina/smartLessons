# ABSTRACT

The objective of our study was to understand learners’ experiences in an LMOOC (Language Massive Open Online Course) and to highlight those elements that make an LMOOC successful. Our research focused on three questions: how do learners perceive their overall experience in the course, which specific LMOOC components learners appreciate, and to what degree the course helped learners achieve their personal learning goals. For our study we collected quantitative and qualitative responses from 226 learners, and we created a unique four-dimensional analysis framework to code each unit of meaning in order to answer our research questions in a systematic way. Learners’ overall experience was rated highly, and the majority of them think the course helped them achieve their learning objectives. Consuming content was the most referred and appreciated learning activity, with video interviews being the most frequently mentioned LMOOC component as well as perceived as a high contributor to both language and cultural knowledge acquisition. Variety was another highly appreciated aspect. In general, receptive activities were the most frequently mentioned and appreciated, perhaps reflecting their preponderance in the course over productive activities. We conclude with some recommendations for future directions in LMOOC development, particularly in the communicative realm.

# KEYWORDS

MOOCs; LMOOCs; online language learning and teaching; learners’ experience

# 1.  Introduction

LMOOCs (Language Massive Open Online Courses) are devoted to the teaching and learning of second languages and cultures, and emerged in the early 2010s as a sub-category of MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) (Martín-Monje & Bárcena, 2014; Sallam et  al., 2020). Compared to traditional in-person language courses, LMOOCs present the obvious advantage of providing opportunities for large numbers of learners who otherwise would not have access to language instruction because of logistical, financial or other constraints. This is particularly true for the so-called ‘Less Commonly Taught Languages’, such as Russian, Chinese and Swahili, among others: these languages are spoken by millions of people and reflect important cultures around the world, yet they are rarely taught in formal settings.

The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the demand for online language courses, on the part of learners and instructors alike. According to Christof Rindlisbacher (2020), ‘Google queries for online classes increased a whopping $2 0 4 \%$ from March 7 to March $_ { 2 1 } '$ while queries for ‘online education’ increased $9 0 \%$ . Providers of MOOCs also grew significantly with the start of the pandemic: Shah (2019) called attention to the fact that edX climbed into the top 1,000 websites in the world, thereby joining Coursera. We observed the same trend with regard to $A P ^ { \circledcirc }$ Italian Language and Culture $( 2 0 I 9 - 2 0 2 0 ) ^ { 1 }$ ( $A P ^ { \circledast }$ Italian hereafter), the LMOOC examined in this study. This course was open during the peak of the pandemic and, between March 18, 2020 and May 18, 2020, when many schools had to close and move to a remote mode of teaching and learning, we observed an increase in enrollment that was four times higher than during the previous two months (January 18–March 18, 2020).2

Despite a worldwide increase since their first appearance, LMOOCs are still relatively few and their scope is limited. Martín-Monje and Bárcena (2014) found 26 LMOOCs; later, in 2017, Beirne et  al. (2017) reported an increase to 143, and most recently (Luo & Ye, 2021) listed 282 LMOOCs offered by the three largest English language MOOC platforms (Coursera, edX and FutureLearn). However, a search of LMOOCs in these platforms revealed that no courses are offered in the following major world languages: Arabic, German, Hindi, Indonesian, Portuguese and Swahili. Looking more closely at edX, only 67 courses can be categorized as LMOOCs (Luo & Ye, 2021) covering these languages: Chinese, English, French, Japanese, Italian, Sign Language and Spanish.

One reason for the absence of many world languages in MOOC platforms and for the relatively low numbers of existing LMOOCs, may be that LMOOCs face the unique challenges of ‘translating’ online the complex process of teaching language communicative skills without the synchronous aid of an instructor or the creation of meaningful learning communities (Colpaert, 2014; Godwin-Jones, 2014; Sallam et  al., 2020). Researchers have also pointed out that, although LMOOCs can be used to teach all language functions, they are more suitable and more effective for receptive skills (Vorobyeva, 2018).

The objective of our study is to understand learners’ experiences in an LMOOC by highlighting not only those activities that are most engaging and the aspects of those activities that learners appreciate the most, but also those organizational and technical issues that received negative appreciation and that may interfere with the learning process. We also analyze learners’ personal goal(s), their reported progress in all skills and their perception of having achieved those goals. Finally, the framework we have designed and implemented to analyze learners’ experience, first of its kind, may serve as a model for other researchers interested in creating and/or studying LMOOCs, whether they be offered with or without teachers’ active presence. For all these reasons, we believe that our study fills a gap in LMOOC research and will be useful both to LMOOCs’ creators and scholars.

# 2.  Literature review

A great deal of research has focused on the factors that affect MOOC learners’ satisfaction and how these relate to their motivation and overall online experience. In a literature review of studies conducted from 2012 through 2015, Shrader et  al. (2016) identified a number of factors—such as interaction, collaboration, motivation, network opportunities, pedagogy, content, assessment, usability, technology and support to learners—that positively affect MOOC learners’ satisfaction, and might also influence dropout rates.

Analyzing the perceptions of 223 MOOC participants, Kumar and Kumar (2020) found that assessment, content and course delivery significantly affect learners’ overall satisfaction level, and that assessment mediates the relationship between course delivery and overall satisfaction. Interestingly, they conclude that course content has the most significant impact on the participants’ satisfaction level whereas course support (technical and tutor) was not found to have a significant impact on overall satisfaction. They also suggest that ‘MOOC providers should focus more on building great course content, ensuring timely and flawless delivery of the lectures along with appropriate course assessment, covering the correct information from the course content’. (Kumar & Kumar, 2020, p. 361).

While MOOC studies are numerous and span several areas, including learners’ level of satisfaction, LMOOCs have received less attention. Martín-Monje and Bárcena (2014) edited a collection of essays and research papers on LMOOCs, thus providing for the first time a theoretical and research framework for this emerging field within MOOCs. According to Sallam et  al. (2020) who conducted a systematic literature review of LMOOC studies, one of the most researched topics is learners’ motivations and experiences with a specific focus on the following issues: self-efficacy, learners’ autonomy, strategy choices, engagement and participation, motivation, beliefs and attitudes, learning styles and the effectiveness of different learning tools and task design. The main conclusion of these studies was that learners who complete LMOOCs tend to show high levels of satisfaction, while those who spend less learning time at the beginning of the course drop out at higher rates. They also conclude that instructors’ online presence and participants’ involvement in social networks have a positive impact on completion rates and increase learners’ social engagement and motivation.

More recently, a special issue of ReCALL (May 2021) offers a global perspective of topics emerging in the LMOOCs field. Specifically, one study closely relates to our research: Luo and Ye (2021) analyze class evaluations of ten different Chinese ESL MOOCs with the aim of creating a criteria framework to assess the quality of LMOOCs. This study identifies five indicators of quality: ‘The effectiveness of teaching content’, ‘Teacher’s oral English proficiency’, ‘Instructional design’, ‘Teacher’s teaching ability’ and ‘The richness of teaching content’. We would like to highlight some important differences between Luo and Ye’s and our study. The LMOOCs considered in Luo and Ye’s study included live broadcasts and the active participation of teachers in the Discussion forum, two tools that very few LMOOCs employ, including $A P ^ { \circledast }$ Italian, the LMOOC that is the subject of this paper. Therefore, two categories that emerged from this study (‘Teacher’s oral English proficiency’, and ‘Teacher’s teaching ability’) may not be useful to assess the quality of other LMOOCs. Our study, by using a unique framework to analyze all aspects of learners’ complex online experiences (including their appreciations of organizational and technical aspects, besides cultural and pedagogical contents), and investigating learners’ personal goals, builds upon Luo and Ye’s findings (2021) and provides new insights into learners’ experience in an LMOOC.

# 3.  Research questions

Our study aimed at gaining a deeper insight into:

1. learners’ experience and appreciation of $A P ^ { \circledcirc }$ Italian as a whole, and of the different course components (resources and activities);   
2. learners’ perceptions about having achieved (or not achieved) their personal learning objectives.

Accordingly, the following research questions were posed:

RQ1: How do learners perceive their general overall experience in $A P ^ { \circledast }$ Italian?   
RQ2: What course components (resources and activities), and what aspects of these components, do learners appreciate?   
RQ3: To what extent did $A P ^ { \circledcirc }$ Italian help learners achieve their personal learning objectives?

# 4.  Method

# 4.1.  Study context

This research study involved learners in $A P ^ { \circledast }$ Italian, an LMOOC designed at Wellesley College (MA, USA) for intermediate/advanced learners of Italian, and open on edX from August 8, 2019 until May 31, 2020. Although the course’s goal was to prepare high school students to successfully pass the College Board’s Advanced Placement Italian Exam given annually in May, $A P ^ { \circledast }$ Italian was also created to meet the needs of any intermediate/advanced learners of Italian wishing to improve their language skills and their knowledge of contemporary Italian culture.

The course included the following resources and activities:

Introductory readings (self-authored written introductions to each   
lesson topic)   
Video interviews (conversations with Italian experts on a variety   
of topics related to contemporary Italian culture and history)   
Articles (journalistic readings)   
Literary readings (excerpts of contemporary Italian literature)   
Other videos (TV ads, film clips)   
Conversiamo! (downloadable audio files with recorded conversa  
tions and pauses designed for learners to intervene)   
Scriviamo! (comprehensive writing activities)   
Discussion forum (short writing activities)   
Quizlet (vocabulary activities)   
Exercises (ungraded practice activities)   
Tests (graded activities)

In addition, optional and free synchronous conversational sessions with native tutors, called Online Office Hours (OOHs hereafter), were offered for five hours per week for 12 consecutive weeks, both in fall 2019 and spring 2020.3 One hundred and twelve learners participated in this activity.

A total of 11,719 learners enrolled in $A P ^ { \circledast }$ Italian, and 117 of them $( 1 \% )$ completed all course components with a score of $6 0 \%$ or higher.

In addition, a total of 798 $( 6 . 7 \% )$ learners completed at least one test with a passing grade $( 6 0 \% )$ .4

# 4.2.  Research design

We drafted a questionnaire with a total of 28 questions (see the Appendix) where we collected both qualitative and quantitative data: quantitative answers were registered on different types of Likert-type scales and each quantitative question was followed by a qualitative open-ended question where learners could explain in detail their quantitative ratings. Collecting both quantitative and qualitative data in parallel, and taking the same population for the quantitative and qualitative dimensions are consonant with the typology of concomitant mixed research methods (Creswell, 2009). In accordance with the pragmatic view of the mixed methods research design, quantitative questions were designed to obtain an overview of general tendencies regarding learners’ experience and level of satisfaction, while qualitative questions highlighted learners’ interpretations of those experiences.

# 4.3.  Procedure and sample

The questionnaire was sent by email at the end of the course (May 31, 2020) to all 11,719 learners who had registered for $A P ^ { \circledast }$ Italian in its 2019–2020 iteration, and it resulted in 226 complete or partial entries.5 For the purpose of this paper, we considered participants’ answers to nine survey questions (out of the 28) that were pertinent to our research questions.

We analyzed the quantitative data using descriptive statistics in order to obtain the minimum, maximum, mean and standard deviation values. Then, we coded the qualitative data adopting the sentence, or part of a sentence, as the unit of meaning, and following an inductive process based on participants’ written answers. We considered only information rich entries, and excluded others, either because they were incomplete or failed to directly answer the survey question. Dimensions and categories emerged from the data, and no specific initial framework was used. Each unit of meaning was scrutinized by all the authors and, following a thorough discussion, was assigned to different dimensions/categories.

We used different tools or categorizations for each question (see Table 1):

to categorize participants’ overall experience and perceptions of specific course components, we used descriptive statistics, and we created a four-dimensional framework (see 4.4);

<html><body><table><tr><td>RQ1: overall experience</td><td>Q4: My overall experience taking APo Italian Language and Culture (2019-2020) has been (1: poor; 2: fair; 3: good; 4: very good; 5: excellent) Q5: Please comment on your overall experience.

to categorize participants’ perceptions of their learning goals and self-reported acquisition of knowledge and language competence, we used descriptive statistics and we created a Coding system (see Sec. 5.2 and Table 8).

# 4.4.  Categorization framework

We created a four-dimensional framework in order to code each unit of meaning (Q5) and capture all aspects of participants’ online experience in all its diverse dimensions (Figure 1).

The broadest dimension is constituted by the following Domains: Pedagogical, Cultural, Organizational, Technical, and Communicational. In the Learner activity dimension, we identified three learners’ activities: Consuming content, Interacting with others, and Interacting with the system. In the LMOOC component dimension, we categorized the units of meaning according to the following: Content, Learning tools, Testing tools, Written production, Oral production. Within each LMOOC component we identified the specific activity mentioned by the participants (see list in 4.1). In the Appreciation dimension we categorized the units of meaning as follows: positive, negative and neutral.

Figure 1. R epresentation of the four-dimensional framework under analysis.

We also considered two more elements associated with the four primary dimensions:

aspect (pace, level, variety, etc.) of the online experience participants mentioned;   
qualifier (adjective, for example: enjoyable, difficult, unpleasant, etc.) that the participants used to describe their online learning experience.

See Table 2 for a complete outline of the four dimensions used to code participants’ answers.

# 5.  Results and discussion

# 5.1.  Learners’ experience in LMOOC

# 5.1.1.  Overall experience

Most participants gave a high rating to their overall experience in $A P ^ { \circledcirc }$ Italian: $7 8 . 9 \%$ of the survey respondents rated the experience as excellent $( 5 0 \% )$ or very good $( 2 8 . 9 \% )$ . The mean (4.23) and the standard deviation values (0.92) point to participants’ consistent high level of satisfaction. Tables 3 and 4 show the descriptive statistics for this question.

Learners’ overall high level of satisfaction is consistent with our data related to Consuming content, the activity participants engage in the most (107 units of meaning, compared to 14 and 12 for Interacting with others and Interacting with the system respectively). Consuming content, an activity which mainly consists of receptive tasks, is also highly appreciated by participants (89 positive, 13 negative and 5 neutral). As mentioned above, a recent study by Luo and Ye (2021) has highlighted the main criteria that determine learners’ appreciation of LMOOCs, but has not examined learners’ general appreciation of an LMOOC’s receptive activities. In the following paragraph we will further explore this point, and will discuss which course components and, specifically, which aspects of these, participants appreciated.

# 5.1.2.  Pedagogical and Cultural domains

Most units of meaning (75 out of 135) were also categorized in the Pedagogical domain (63 positive appreciation, 12 negative and 3 neutral). Sixty-five units of meaning in the Pedagogical domain were categorized as Consuming content, and eleven as Interacting with others. The aspects most mentioned in the pedagogical domain are variety, level, quality, relevance of materials, methods, content, using adjectives and verbs such as terrific, brilliant, good, interesting, enjoyed, liked, loved, to describe the specific course components and their aspects.

Table 3. D escriptive statistics for Q4: ‘My overall experience taking $\mathsf { A P } ^ { \otimes }$ Italian Language and Culture (2029–2020) has been: 1: poor, 2: fair, 3: good, 4: very good, 5: excellent.’   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Question</td><td>Minimum</td><td>Maximum</td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td><td>n</td></tr><tr><td>Overall experience</td><td>1.00</td><td>5.00</td><td>4.23</td><td>0.92</td><td>218</td></tr></table></body></html>

The second most referred domain is the Cultural domain with 33 units of meaning (31 positive and 2 neutral). All comments categorized under the Cultural domain belonged to the Consuming content learner activity. In this domain, participants mentioned the aspects of those course components that they found most helpful, such as variety, authenticity, history and integration language-culture. Qualifiers used included liked, engaging and relevant.

Variety (12 mentions) is a recurrent theme in both Cultural and Pedagogical domains. Participants mentioned variety in relation to the topics presented, materials, and methods used. Level, selection of topics and the integration of language and culture are also important aspects that elicited positive appreciations. Participants seem to particularly value the historical content of online material (4 positive comments of historical content in the Cultural domain: 2 in relation to videos, 1 in relation to written material, and 1 to overall content).

Table 4. S cale results for Q4.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Scale</td><td>Count</td></tr><tr><td>Poor</td><td>2 (0.92%)</td></tr><tr><td>Fair</td><td>8 (3.67%)</td></tr><tr><td>Good</td><td>36 (16.51%)</td></tr><tr><td>Very good</td><td>63 (28.90%)</td></tr><tr><td>Excellent</td><td>109 (50.00%)</td></tr><tr><td>n</td><td>218</td></tr></table></body></html>

These results underscore the importance of offering a diverse online curriculum (including video and written material) to keep learners engaged: by using all affordances provided on the hosting platform, online language courses can enhance learners’ engagement if they offer content that is culturally varied, authentic and well-integrated with the targeted language structures. Finally, it is worth noting that, although most course content is cultural in nature, and the practice of language structures is limited to an optional grammar section, most participants appreciated the pedagogical value of cultural learning, hence their comments were classified under the pedagogical rather than the cultural domain (75 versus 33 units of meaning respectively). More specifically, as we analyze below, learners appreciated video interviews on different cultural topics for their pedagogical more than for their cultural value; for this reason, most learners’ comments related to video interviews were categorized in the pedagogical rather that in the cultural domain. This supports our conclusions that learners pay a lot of attention to their progress in language skills even when the objective of the course may be the acquisition or expansion of cultural knowledge.

# 5.1.3.  Organizational, Technical and Communicational domains

We coded 19 units of meaning under the Organizational domain (16 positive and 3 negative), and most (13) fall under the Consuming content learner activity. Positive comments refer to aspects such as structure, length, price, presentation or level. The negative comments regard the relatively short duration of the course, the overwhelming amount of material offered and a syllabus which was perceived as hard to navigate. The relatively high number of entries for the Organizational domain suggests that offering sound cultural and pedagogical content and activities is not enough to keep students engaged: a rational and clear presentation and organization of this material is also a fundamental factor in the success of an LMOOC.

We found only 8 comments in the Technical domain, and we categorized all but one as Interacting with the system. In the Technical domain, unlike in the Cultural and Pedagogical domains, we observed that the distribution of negative (4) and positive (4) appreciations is equal. Negative appreciations refer mainly to some specific functionalities of the platform (one participant points to the lack of feedback when an answer is marked as incorrect, while the other comments refer to the difficulty in retrieving information or clearing results of tests and exercises in order to resubmit).

The significant negative appreciation in the Technical domain points to the importance of a close examination of all the possible technical limitations of the system, which the course creators have to keep in mind while designing the course and can alert the learners to by offering possible workarounds. Extreme clarity and consistency in explaining the functionality of each learning and assessment component, and informing learners in advance of the intrinsic limitations of the system, might limit learners’ frustration in this domain and contribute to a more seamless learning experience.

As for the Communicational domain, we only categorized five units of meaning all of which were positive. The low number of comments in this domain complements what other researchers have already said about the adequateness of LMOOCs to teach receptive rather than productive language skills (Vorobyeva, 2018). Nor is this surprising because, although $A P ^ { \circledast }$ Italian provides some tools designed for the practice of interpersonal communicative skills (for example, the sections Conversiamo! and Scriviamo!, and OOHs), the focus of the course is the practice of receptive skills (oral and reading comprehension). This is not by design or choice; rather, it is an adaptation to the affordances provided by the edX platform, and to the limitations posed by institutional funding, since running OOHs and/or other forms of live online presence or instruction require considerable administrative as well as financial support. Therefore, it is understandable that most participants would comment on course tools that were designed for the practice of receptive skills, simply because these learning tools were the most prevalent.

# 5.1.4.  Course components: spotlight on ‘video interviews’

The course component that received the most mentions in the Pedagogical domain is video interviews with 20 comments (18 positive and 1 negative), followed by overall (12 positive and 2 negative). In the Cultural domain, although overall is the largest category (17), video interviews (9) is the most referenced course component. The aspects most frequently mentioned are variety, relevance, authenticity and range, with qualifiers such as liked, enjoyed, and relevant.

In order to understand participants’ appreciation of all course components and, specifically, of video interviews, we also examined Q6 and Q7.6 In Q6, all major course components received relatively high scores (for a complete list, see 4.1 Study context). However, video interviews have the highest mean value (5.37) and lowest standard deviation (1.06) (see detailed results in Table 5).

Table 5. D escriptive statistics for Q6: ‘How much did each course component contribute to your learning of the Italian language and culture?’ 1: did not use; 2: not at all; 3: little; 4: somewhat; 5: a good amount; 6: a great deal.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Course component</td><td> Minimum</td><td> Maximum</td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td><td>n</td></tr><tr><td>Introductory reading</td><td>1.00</td><td>6.00</td><td>4.99</td><td>1.17</td><td>208</td></tr><tr><td>Video interviews</td><td>1.00</td><td>6.00</td><td>5.37</td><td>1.06</td><td>206</td></tr><tr><td>Other videos</td><td>1.00</td><td>6.00</td><td>4.98</td><td>1.24</td><td>202</td></tr><tr><td>Articles</td><td>1.00</td><td>6.00</td><td>5.12</td><td>1.24</td><td>203</td></tr><tr><td>Literary reading</td><td>1.00</td><td>6.00</td><td>5.00</td><td>1.34</td><td>202</td></tr></table></body></html>

The results in both qualitative and quantitative questions support each other, as video interviews also received a high number of positive comments in Q7.7 We collected 62 open responses and 17 of these contained positive appreciations of video interviews (in addition, 2 neutral comments pointed to the need for clearer videos and videos with more grammatically correct speech, and one negative comment lamented the difficulty in understanding spoken Italian in videos). Qualifiers associated to this course component include helpful, enjoyable, useful, varied, and informative. Participants also mention several features of video interviews that they greatly appreciate: variety (3 times), current topics (3 times), and PlayPosit, the comprehension activities embedded in the videos (3 times); this pedagogical feature allows learners to test their comprehension as they are watching the video. The following are two representative participants’ comments: ‘The video interviews and the readings were excellent! Comprehensible input at its best!’ and ‘The video interviews offer interesting conversations from native speakers’. Although we did not carry out a statistical analysis to detect any possible correlation between the elements that participants highly appreciate and those that they consider contributory (this would be beyond the scope of this research study), this finding shows that participants both enjoy this particular LMOOC component, and also value it for the language and culture knowledge acquisition it provides. By bringing unrehearsed and authentic spoken language to learners who often study a language in isolation and with little or no interaction with native speakers, video interviews can help students focus both on language structures and cultural themes.

Our results regarding the popularity of videos among LMOOC learners are in line with the findings of Martín-Monje et  al. (2017) who concluded in their study that short videos are the most powerful learning objects in LMOOCs, and with the study of Luo and Ye (2021) who found that the quality of videos is one of four ‘Initial Indicators and statement in quality evaluation of LMOOCs’. The importance of videos is also recognized in the language educational field: according to a recent literature review study, the most frequently used type of technology for content delivery to enhance language learning is multimedia (visual and audio) content (Zhang & Zou, 2020).

# 5.1.5.  Course components: communicative and productive activities

In Q5, 16 comments were categorized under the Interacting with others learning activity and, within this, the OOHs received 13 mentions (12 positive and one negative appreciation). The single negative comment points to different levels of proficiency within the same OOH group. All other comments are quite generic, but most praised the opportunity to converse in Italian, while others commented positively on the quality of the instructors. Two other comments regarded the responsiveness of the instructors to student’s queries, while one entry (negative appreciation) refers to the uselessness of the Discussion forum (‘blind leading the blind’) since instructors do not provide responses to learners’ entries in the Discussion forum.

Only 112 learners were able to participate once or more than once in the OOHs: logistic and funding factors limited this offering, with the result that only 20 students per week could avail themselves of this learning opportunity. This factor might have contributed to the relative scarcity of comments in the category Interacting with others.

Only one participant mentions the optional activities Scriviamo!, Conversiamo! and Discussion Forum (SCD hereafter) in Q5. These activities are the only three components, besides the OOHs, that are designed for the practice of free language production (in speaking [Conversiamo!] and writing [Scriviamo! and Discussion forum]). However, unlike the OOHs, the speaking activity Conversiamo! is a mere shadow of an authentic interaction, since it consists of a recorded conversation (in the form of a downloadable audio file) with pauses for students to intervene, and the writing activities, Scriviamo! and Discussion forum, have the limit of not being checked by instructors.

In order to better understand participants’ perception of these components, we examined Q8 where participants were explicitly asked to evaluate their experience with these tools. The relatively low score received by these components (on a 6-point scale $\begin{array} { r l r } { \overline { { \bf x } } } & { { } = } & { 3 . 4 8 } \end{array}$ for Conversiamo!; $\overline { { \mathbf { x } } } ~ = ~ 3 . 1 7$ for Scriviamo!; $\overline { { \mathbf { x } } } ~ = ~ 2 . 6 1$ for Discussion forum) is also accompanied by a much higher rate of ‘didn’t use’ $( 3 3 . 0 1 \%$ for Conversiamo!; $4 0 . 3 9 \%$ for Scriviamo!; $4 8 . 2 4 \%$ for Discussion forum). See detailed results in Table 6.

Unlike all other course components (videos interviews, readings, etc.) the activities SCD are not directly followed by an assessment tool (exercises and tests that give immediate feedback), and are not included in learners’ edX Progress page (report of graded activities). These factors may have contributed to their low appreciation and rate of use, as some participants mentioned in their responses to the open-ended Q9.

Table 6. D escriptive statistics for Q8: ‘How much did each writing and speaking activity contribute to your learning experience?’ 1: did not use; 2: not at all; 3: little; 4: somewhat; 5: a good amount; 6: a great deal.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Writing and speaking activity</td><td>Minimum</td><td>Maximum</td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td><td>n</td></tr><tr><td>Conversiamo!e</td><td>1.00</td><td>6.00</td><td>3.48</td><td>1.95</td><td>209</td></tr><tr><td>Scriviamo!</td><td>1.00</td><td>6.00</td><td>3.17</td><td>1.96</td><td>203</td></tr><tr><td>Discussion forum</td><td>1.00</td><td>6.00</td><td>2.61</td><td>1.79</td><td>199</td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 7. D escriptive statistics for Q11: ‘How much did the optional Grammar review (Ripasso grammaticale) contribute to your learning experience?’ 1: did not use; 2: not at all; 3: little; 4: somewhat; 5: a good amount; 6: a great deal.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Minimum</td><td> Maximum</td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td><td>n</td></tr><tr><td>1.00</td><td>6.00</td><td>4.53</td><td>1.67</td><td>208</td></tr></table></body></html>

In this regard, it might be helpful to consider participants’ answers regarding Grammar review (Table 7), another optional tool in the course (Q11). Unlike SCD, activities in Grammar review provide learners with immediate feedback since all exercises and tests are self-correcting. Grammar review received a much lower rate of ‘didn’t use’ than SCD ( $1 4 . 4 2 \%$ compared to $3 3 . 0 1 \%$ , $4 0 . 3 0 \%$ and $4 8 . 2 4 \%$ for Scriviamo!, Conversiamo! and Discussion Forum respectively), and generally higher scores ( $6 6 . 6 2 \%$ for $^ a$ good amount and $^ a$ great deal in contribution to learning, compared to $4 1 . 6 2 \%$ , $3 3 . 5 0 \%$ and $2 0 . 1 1 \%$ for Scriviamo!, Conversiamo! and Discussion Forum respectively). Although these tools were all optional and, therefore, learners’ scores were not recorded in their Progress report, Grammar Review provided the immediate gratification of feedback, an element that is missing in SCD, as some students explicitly lamented in their answers to Q7, and that may have caused the ‘lack of motivation’ and ‘perceived uselessness’ discussed above. Our findings are in line with the results of the aforementioned study by Luo and Ye (2021): ESL students consider teacher’s feedback as one of the top five quality indicators in an LMOOCs. Other studies have reached similar conclusions: teacher’s feedback determine learners’ engagement and retention rates in MOOCs (Goh et  al., 2017; Hew, 2018); conversely, the lack of feedback is related to negative online learning experience (Liu et  al., 2014).

# 5.2.  Learners’ goals and reported progress

The majority of participants $( 8 4 \% )$ agreed or strongly agreed that the course helped them achieve their learning objectives $\acute { \mathbf { x } } = 4 . 1 5$ , $S D { = } 0 . 9 6$ on a 5-point agreement scale). This resonates with their satisfaction of the overall experience of the course.

Table 8. Coding system for Q3: ‘The course $\mathsf { A P } ^ { \otimes }$ Italian Language and Culture helped me achieve my learning objectives’ (1: strongly disagree; 2: disagree; 3: neither agree nor disagree; 4: agree; 5: strongly agree). ‘Please comment on the above rating’.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Main categorye</td><td>Comments related to language competence: 23 units of meaning Comments related to cultural knowledge: 10 units of meaning</td></tr><tr><td>Subcategorye</td><td>Comments related to general knowledge: 4 units of meaning Progress (comments where learners report progress achieved through the online course): 43 units of meaning</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Maintenance (comments where learners report that the course allowed them to maintain or brush up on the language): 3 units of meaning Lack of progress (comments where learners report that they have not made any</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>progress): 1 units of meaning</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Practice (comments where learners report that the course allowed them to practice the language): 1</td></tr><tr><td>Description</td><td>For example: &#x27;general improvement&#x27;, &#x27;improved comprehension, &#x27;improved understanding and learning&#x27; &#x27;identified new authors and cities&#x27;</td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 9. S ubcategory ‘Progress’: areas of progress identified by participants.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Area</td><td>Comprehension (listening and reading)</td><td>Culture</td><td>Vocabulary</td><td>General progress</td><td> Grammar</td><td> Speaking</td><td>Writing</td></tr><tr><td>No. of responses</td><td>11</td><td>10</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>1</td></tr></table></body></html>

For the analysis of the open-ended comments, we used the categories shown in Table 8.

The preponderance of comments related to language competence (23) over comments related to cultural knowledge (10) is consistent with our findings in 5.1.2: most participants value their progress in language skills, although course content is mainly cultural in nature. The 43 units of meaning in the subcategory ‘Progress’ also confirm this finding, with progress in comprehension (listening and reading), vocabulary and grammar outnumbering reported progress in cultural knowledge (see Table 9).

Moreover, the preponderance of reported progress in receptive skills (listening and reading) over interpersonal communicative skills (speaking and writing) is also consistent with our qualitative data collected in Q5 regarding the overall experience and discussed above, where only a small number of comments could be categorized as Interacting with others. This is also consistent with the course content which centered around receptive skills.

These results also support one of our conclusions as discussed above: participants not only like receptive activities and think that these activities contributed most to their learning of the language, but they report on or express evidence of progress in receptive skills. Our findings in this area are consistent with recent studies: Mac Lochlainn et  al. (2021) examined learners’ behavior in a beginner Irish LMOOC and found different levels of learners’ engagement that do not necessarily involve the need to participate in and communicate within a wider learning community; specifically, they found that most learners ‘viewed the course more as a store of information, and bank of L2 learning resources, rather than a means of communication with other learners, or opportunities to practice L2 production socially’ (p. 122); Ding and Shen (2021) examined 3,510 learners’ reviews of 41 ESL MOOCs and found that learners had a preference for a traditional and input-oriented approach to learning a foreign language; finally, Chik and Ho (2017) studied beginner ‘recreational learners’ and found that, at least in the initial phase of their studies, they preferred to learn in isolation, using mainly graded materials and texts.

# 6.  Conclusions

Our study fills a gap in LMOOC research by examining participants’ assessment of their overall learning experience and goals in $A P ^ { \circledast }$ Italian. Our four-dimensional framework allowed us to categorize participants’ comments through different axes, assign each one to a domain, and highlight those elements that participants appreciate and value the most.

Our quantitative results show that participants highly appreciate the overall learning experience of $A P ^ { \circledast }$ Italian, while the qualitative results support this finding as most of the entries are positive in all dimensions. Consuming content is participants’ most frequently mentioned and appreciated learning activity, with video interviews being the specific course component that is most frequently mentioned, and that is perceived as a high contributor to language and cultural knowledge acquisition. When participants are asked to what extent the course helped them reach their learning goals, they predominantly report progress in receptive skills (comprehension, culture, and vocabulary). As mentioned above, receptive activities (video interviews, articles, literary pieces) also receive high ratings. Future studies might determine the cause of this preference: Do learners have no expectations of engaging in any live interaction when they register for an LMOOC? Are their learning objectives met by receptive activities, without any interactive elements? Is this the result of course design (which features predominantly receptive activities) and/ or of the mandatory nature of receptive activities and their being accompanied by immediate feedback? These are just hypotheses as our data did not allow us to come to a definite conclusion.

We also observed that interactive and productive activities are not referenced frequently and are used less often by participants, in contrast to grammar activities which are more frequently used in spite of being not mandatory. Once more, there might be several reasons for this preference on the part of participants, such as the fact that those activities were followed by immediate feedback, and/or participants’ underlying beliefs regarding the importance of grammar in language learning (Incecay & Dollar, 2011; Loewen et  al., 2009). Finally, our study also shows that a positive learning experience relies not only on pedagogical and cultural elements but also on a clear course structure and organization, relatively devoid of technical issues.

Participants highly appreciated the aspect of variety in the course. This can be achieved by offering different types of activities with the goal of differentiating the learning process and expanding the ways in which participants can engage in the learning experience. For example, in $A P ^ { \circledcirc }$ Italian, this was achieved in two ways:

We presented the same cultural content through a variety of media and genres (video interview, articles, literary excerpts), and learners could utilize these in any order they wished.   
We presented each content through a variety of optional pedagogical tools. For example, video interviews were presented with or without subtitles, timed transcripts, and embedded activities, and readings were presented as downloadable pdf files, audio files, and with embedded annotations.

Variety may enhance motivation as learners can choose among many learning tools and discover their preferred learning strategies. This process may also lead to an increase in agency, defined as learners’ lurking potential for self-directed engagement (Agonács et  al., 2020). Thus, we recommend that all affordances offered by the platform be used, so that learners can be exposed to different strategies to tackle any given topic. It is also worth noting that Luo and Ye’s study (2021) identifies ‘the richness of teaching content’ as one of the top five LMOOC quality indicators, confirming that ESL learners share with learners in $A P ^ { \circledcirc }$ Italian the same appreciation for variety.

We acknowledge the following limitations of this study. Firstly, our results and conclusions apply to an LMOOC in Italian at the intermediate/advanced level, therefore the framework we propose may need to be modified to include additional categories for beginner level LMOOCs. For example, a recent study (Friðriksdóttir, 2021) examines an LMOOC at the beginner level, and found that ‘gradual and scaffolded presentation of input’ improves learners’ retention. Further studies might show whether this factor has an impact on learners’ experience at the intermediate/advanced level as well. Secondly, the underlying reasons for participants’ appreciation of specific course components are unclear. Future studies could explore those reasons. Finally, it is important to acknowledge that our conclusions are based on participants’ perceptions about their own learning experience and knowledge acquisition, which might not coincide with their actual level of acquired skills and competences.

Despite these limitations, our study represents a significant contribution to the LMOOC research field because a) it considers specific LMOOC components in the analysis of learners’ overall experience, b) it considers learners’ individual learning objectives, and c) it uses a new four-dimensional analysis framework to capture and analyze LMOOC learners’ overall experience from different angles. This framework might help advance the field of LMOOC studies as other researchers could find it useful to code participants’ answers to any LMOOC evaluation tool.

# 6.1.  Recommendations for the future: communicative language learning direction for LMOOCs

In the following paragraphs, we provide some suggestions on how LMOOC designers and teachers can maintain and foster learners’ motivation, and facilitate meaningful online interactions. Our study points to the need that content, methods and topics presented be varied and engaging. As technology rapidly advances, more sophisticated tools become available: for example, Berti (2020) has tested the use of 360-degrees videos (some available as OER on YouTube via a special license) to create immersive VR experiences that can provide online learners, especially those who cannot travel, with experiential learning in the target country: this may be particularly relevant during the current COVID-19 pandemic, when travel may be difficult or restricted. Shih (2020) also suggests that immersive VR tools may reduce language learning anxiety and increase learners’ interest in the target language and culture.

Our study also shows that synchronous learning experiences such as our OOHs receive positive comments from learners. Though we recognize that this feature may not be widely adopted, we believe that LMOOCs should strive to provide some forms of community building and interactive learning experience. Asynchronous communication venues, such as the discussion forum, may also prove to be important to learner’s engagement, provided they offer some form of feedback. Chik and Ho (2017) propose a model for manageable feedback that uses Facebook groups to engage learners in written exchanges. Bailey and Cassidy (2019) found that a system of peer-to-peer feedback improved learners’ writing skills and lowered their level of anxiety. Also, peer-to-peer learning tools such as eTandem might offer additional interpersonal and interpretive practice (Appel & Pujolà, 2021). As Motzo and Proudfoot (2017) suggest, the discussion forum could be used to promote connectivity by inviting learners to comment on prompts that explicitly encourage cross-cultural comparisons and invite students to respond to one another. Course administrators could also create designated spaces in the discussion forum where learners can share their effective and successful learning strategies. Moreover, the adoption of conversational exchanges with native speakers using third party providers such as Mixxer, TalkAbroad, and similar, may be other ways to promote the online practice of interpersonal communication in an LMOOC. Learners could also be invited to report on their conversational exchange experiences in the discussion forum. Finally, activities that employ some forms of voice recognition to enable automated verbal practice and feedback or assessment (such as H5P) might be relatively inexpensive and effective ways of engaging learners in oral production. By working in this direction, LMOOCs could create a model of applied connectivism in the online learning experience and provide that variety aspect that participants in our survey perceived as very beneficial to their learning. Unfortunately, the varied and complex tools needed to promote connectivity in Second Language (SL) online teaching and learning are not always available in existing MOOC platforms. Therefore, a specific platform created with SL acquisition goals in mind might be necessary to further expand the creation and use of LMOOCs (Motzo & Proudfoot, 2017).

Despite their limitations, especially in areas of interpersonal communication, LMOOCs can be effective at meeting learners’ needs and helping them achieve their goals as our study suggests. LMOOCs also fill an existing gap in SL education as they have the potentials to reach large numbers of learners who, otherwise, would not have access to face-toface language instruction because of logistic and/or financial obstacles. At a time when globalization requires the ability to communicate across cultures in all professions, LMOOCs can play an important role as they open up unique opportunities of cross-cultural experiences for everyone.

From educators’ point of view, LMOOCs’ massive numbers of heterogeneous learners may provide a global lab to test teaching and learning theories and practices. This may have enormous potentials for advancements in the field of second language acquisition. LMOOCs may also be used as the basis for any face-to-face curricula, as Hashemifardnia et  al. (2021) show in their recent study, reducing the cost of traditional textbooks.

However, LMOOCs are also complex creatures that require a massive amount of effort and resources to create. The variety and richness of learning tools needed to make an LMOOC successful require the coordinated effort by many stakeholders (teachers, educational technologists, language program coordinators, etc.), so that all the phases of an LMOOC creation, from initial idea to completion and evaluation, be covered. This is why we fully subscribe to the idea that LMOOCs should be OER (Open Educational Resources) in the fullest sense of the terms, i.e. resources that can be reused, revised, remixed and redistributed (Colpaert, 2014). Only by building on each other’s experiences and efforts we can help LMOOCs grow and become a recognized entity in the teaching and learning of world languages.

6. The four-dimensional framework described above (Figure 1), being designed to analyze learners’ perception of their general experience in the course, could not be used for $Q 6 ~ \& ~ 7$ since these questions asked learners to evaluate specific course components. Therefore, in analyzing answers to Q6 & 7, we considered the scores received by each course component and participants’ type of appreciation (positive, negative and neutral).   
7. We recognize that Q7 asked participants to elaborate on additional elements (‘interest’ and ‘suggestions for improvement’, besides contribution to learning). For this reason, we considered only those units of meaning that elaborated on participants’ rating in Q6.
