Academic discourse continues to function as a gateway to educational success As a form of knowledge that imbues power upon those who can master it, i has long been a focus of concen for reearchers and teachers. While academic discourse studies have been traditionall situated in terms of specific contexts and/or discrete perspectives, this ten-chapter volume is substantial contribution to breaking this mould. Specificlly, it further iluminates the ongoing dialogue/collaboration between Legitimation Code Theory (LCT) and Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL). Focusing primarily on academic discourse, the volume moves the fields of educational sociology and linguistics closer to a fuller understanding of knowledge and knower structures. Through the disparate, yet complimentary perspectives of LCT (primarily its organizing principle of semantic codes) and SFL (primarily the framework of discourse semantics, the individual chapters both exemplify and further the productive dialogue between the two theories/approaches. The resultant collection moves educational sociology and lingusics further toward understanding educational equality and cumulative knowledge building.

The volume starts with an introduction by the Editors (Chapter 1), who outine how SFL and LCT first engaged through a shared interest in Basil Bernstein's knowledge structures. They introduce key concepts from SFL, Bernstein's theorizing, and LCT. The remainder of the book is divided into four parts: firs, the reader is inroduced to two of LT's four key dimensions: Speciization and Semantics (Part I) which \*each explore a distinctive species of legitimation code" (p. 3); this isfollowed by two chapters that discuss potential theoretical realignments of FL's mode and field through engagement with Semantics (Part I); the focus then switches to the role of knowers in discourse, where the primary goal is the analysis of evaluative language through SFL's APPRAISAL (Par II) the volume finishes by exploring how the developments highlighted in previous chapter can be applied to classroom research/practice (Part IV).

In terms of content, Maton and Chen (Chapter 2) focus on LCT and Specialization, where they briefl outline specialization codes (how knowledge and knowers are positioned). The authors then explore contrasting dispositions between Chinese students' existing learning experiences and the Australian teaching practices they encounter when studying overseas. Their analysis shows how the students' coding orientations (knowledge code) and the overseas' teaching practices (knower code) clash, which effectively left the students experiencing arelativs code ("anything goes" [p. 391). In other words, they faced "a vacum of legitimacy" (p. 52) and thus felt powerles. Moving on to LCT's Semantics, Maton (Chapter 3) outlines semantic waves in terms of semantic gravity (SG) and semantic density (SD). Briefly, SG relates to the amount of context dependency in a practice, whereas SD refers to how much meaning is condensed in a practice. Maton highlights how changes in $\mathsf { S G } \uparrow \downarrow$ and $\mathbf { S D \uparrow \downarrow }$ through time can be captured in semantic profiles, which incorporate semantic waves of varying amplitudes (within a semantic range) and frequencies (the number of semantic shifts in apofile). Maton believes that the abilit to (re)produce contextually apropriate semantic waves may be one key toumulative development by enabling the recontextualization of knowledge through time and space." (p. 81)

This focus on the importance of context is continued in Part II, which includes a re-appraisal of contextual dependency in SFL (specifically mode and field) in light of LCT's Semantics. Martin and Matruglio (Chapter 4) re-examine mode with regard to context dependency and semantic gravity. Within SFL, mode reflects \*whether language is ancillary to or constitive of what is going on" (p. 91). Although, mode i traditionally asociated with textual meanings, this chapter works through textual, interpersonal, and idea tional contributions to mode, with the resulting potentials grouped together as presence. The unfolding discussion/analysis highlights how presence can be realized via implicitnes through textual meaning (choices in IDENTIFICATION and PERIODICITY), negotiability through interpersonal meaning (primarily through afect [APPRAISAL] and modal responsibility [NEGOTIATION], and iconicity reflected in experiential meanings (a scale of congruent to incongruent realizations). Moving to field, Martin (Chapter 5) examines its role in context dependency with regard to disciplinarity, framing his discussion in light of LCT's semantic density. From Martin's viewpoint, field involes a set of activity sequences and their assciated taxonomies, which together contribute to the complexit of a text. Accordingly, Martin discusses how field can construe/reflect technicdlity (distillations of experiential meanings), iconcity (legitmization through interpersonal meanings), and aggregation (consolidation through textual meanings). The resultant potentials are once again grouped together under one term: mass Thus, much like the previous chapter, this chapter takes a cross-functional perspective, highlighting how instantiation may be a more fruitful way to explore syndromes of meaning.

Shifting focus slightly, Part I discusses how aspects of APPRAISAL (and APPRECIATION in Chapter 7) can be used to explore LCT's conception of knowers and values. Drawing primaril on ATTITUDE and ENGAGEMENT (subsystems of APPRAISAL), Doran (Chapter 6), outlines a procedure to explore values nacted in axilogcal constellations (or ondng networks in F tems). Spificlly, he fouses on how ideational meanings are charged with inerpersonal evaluations' (p. 155) in newspaper articles -the topic of discusion is how Australias stlement/olonization should be represented. His dtaild analys iustrates how it i possible to explore value systems held by communities of people without resorting to intuition. Ortezia (Chapter 7) continues this theme of analyzing the values in politically charged historical discourse through APPRsA, yet she overlays her aalysis ont semantic profile in Chilean clarooms and academic publications. Much like Doran's chapter, her analysis is highly detailed and insighful. She also introduces the need to include ctoral and processural xes in studies of historical discoursealthough they are not explored in any detail, the reader can deduce thir usefulnes. Overall, rteiads an excellent jo f illstrating ow an appraisal analys can e situated along a smantic proil, highlighting where evaluative pulses occur with regard to increases/decreases in semantic density and gravity.

Part IV builds on the theorizing of Part I by illstrating how presence and masscan be used to explore classroom discourse. Hood (Chapter 8 reignites the discussion of presence and semantic gravity (Chapter 4) by exploring the discourse in a live Health Science lecture. Her detailed analys uses preence as a kind of cross-therizing translating device. his enables her to llustrate how phases of discourse explaining, reporting, and describing) can be linked to semantic gravity through the linguistic features they realie i., through choices in presence). Hood shows how phases of describing are the most reliant on increased presence ( $\cdot +$ iconicity, +implicitness, & $^ +$ negotiability $[ s \mathbf { G } + ] )$ , whereas reporting relies the least on presence ( $\cdot +$ iconicity, -implicitness, & -negotiability [SG1). Part I is brought to a close by Rose with the recontextualization of SFL's existing metalanguage in terms of building a pedagogic metalanguage. In the final two chapters, Rose outlines the reading to learn (R2L) approach in terms of is procedural sequencing. He also outlines how the development of a pedagogic metalanguage can be useful in developing teacher training programs (curriculum genres; Chapter 9) and classroom practice (knowledge genres; Chapter 10). He discusses how this recontextualized pedagogic metalanguage can be used strategically in learning cycles, where different activities license diffrent levels of presence and mass.

Overall the book wl no doubt become an essential reading for those working across LCT and SFL platforms. However, given the focus on L's Semantics through most of the book, the incusion of Chapter 2 (Specialization) semed alittle out of place. Moreover, While the book is highly detaild in its analysis f extracts, how one gets from coding SFL-based features of discourse to their rep. resentation in LCT-driven diagrams semed a little mysterious: Mato alludes to this when he states studies using these concepts are developing sophisticated instruments for calibrating profiles with precision' (p. 68; also see p. 26 in the introduction) an indication of how the volume's authors approached this issue would have been welcomed. Furthermore, while LCT has evolved alongside a consideration of Bernstein's and SFL's theorizing on the role of language in education, at times, i felt like LCT was leading SFL forward, when in reality--and as noted toward the end of the introduction-a lot of background discusson undoubtedly goes on behind the scenes. More glimpses into this two-way dialogue would have added to the interdisciplinary "feel" of the volume (cf. the conclusion of Chapter 4 for one such example). The only other \*criticism' I have-if it is even a criticism given the target read ership-is the amount oftechnical terminology and level of abstraction the book contains. I would argue that even researchers/educators familiar with SFL may struggl at times, especially if they are not familiar with Martin's discourse semantic extension of Hallidayan SFL.

Nevertheles, despite these "shortcomings" (and I use this term loosely), this volume is a substantial contribution, and it clearly moves SFL and LCT further toward their respective (and joint) goals of understanding the complexities of the language and sociology of education. It is a thought provoking and challnging read, and it warrants inclusion on the bookshelf of anyone interested in researching, teaching, or working with academic/disciplinary discourse. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly rare to read an edited volume that hangs together so well, o I commend the Editors and authors on compiling such a well-constructed and cross-pollinated volume. Overall, the volume i original and thought provoking, and it will be useful to anyone interested in increasing social equality through accessing academic discourse..
