This article investigates the effects of genre and topic on the metaphors used by Chinese as a foreign language (CFL) learners’ writing. Using Conceptual Metaphor Theory as the theoretical framework, our study analyzed 900 essays, which include three genres (argumentative essays, narrative essays, and letter writing) and six topics, extracted from the HSK Dynamic Essay Corpus. The results show that both genre and topic influence the use of metaphors by CFL learners, but their effects manifest in different ways. Genre influences the frequency of metaphor due to dif ferences in pragmatic purposes. Specifically, we found that argumentative essays and narrative essays exhibit a notably higher frequency of metaphor use than letter writing. Argumentative essays have a higher frequency than narrative essays. Topic not only affects the frequency of metaphor use but also influences the selection and frequency of classic source domains. Addi tionally, differences in metaphor frequency across topics are more pronounced in genres with higher metaphor frequency (argumentative essays and narrative essays) and insignificant in a genre with the lowest metaphor frequency (letter writing). Our findings contribute to the further development of conceptual metaphor theory, as well as to the teaching of genre and metaphor in Chinese L2 writing.

# 1. Introduction

The use of metaphors in second language (L2) writing is a research hotspot (Byrnes, 2009; Guo, 2019; Littlemore et al., 2014; Moghadam & Ghafar-Samar, 2020; Ryshina-pankova, 2010). It is not only an important indicator for assessing L2 conceptual fluency but also contributes to enhancing L2 communicative competence (Danesi, 1992, 1995; Kathpalia & Carmel, 2011; Littlemore & Low, 2006). In L2 writing, genre-specific text writing based on a given topic is a common task for evaluating writing proficiency. Genre provides pragmatic purposes and rhetorical strategies for communication (Tardy & Gevers, 2024), and the topic closely influences the choice and frequency of vocabulary in writing (Kim & Ryoo, 2011). Therefore, an interesting question is to what extent the metaphors used in L2 writing vary due to the writing’s topic and genre, including the metaphor frequency and source domain groups of metaphors.

Previous studies have shown that the use of metaphors in L2 writing is influenced by genre. For example, the frequency of met aphors is higher in argumentative essays and narrative essays than in letter writing (Wang, 2019). Additionally, the frequency of metaphors varies by topic. For instance, more metaphors are used on the topic of friendship than on the topic of nature (Golden, 2021). Although previous studies have revealed some valuable findings, there are still certain limitations. These studies have not system atically combined genre and topic to comprehensively examine metaphor use, overlooking the potential interaction between genre and topic, and failing to compare their differing effects on metaphor use.

Our study, based on the HSK Dynamic Essay Corpus, considers the influence of both genre and topic on metaphor use by Chinese as foreign language (CFL) learners. Specifically, it investigates whether metaphor expressions in CFL writing are equally prominent across six topics within the three genres (argumentative essays, narrative essays, and letter writing), and examines the differences in source domains used. Our study can help L2 teachers and L2 writers to use metaphors more effectively in various writing tasks, enhancing the expressiveness and persuasiveness of L2 writing.

# 2. Metaphor and conceptual metaphor theory

As early as ancient Greece, logicians had already begun to value the logical function of metaphor (Frost, 1996). Aristotle (384 B. C.–322 B.C.) mentioned in Rhetoric that “ordinary words convey only what we know already; it is from metaphor that we can best get hold of something fresh” (Aristotle, 2010, p. 124). This suggests that ancient Greek logicians regarded metaphor as both a cognitive and rhetorical tool. Through the comparison of two things, metaphor allows people to gain cognitive insights that are typically un attainable through linear or syllogistic reasoning (Frost, 1996). However, Lakoff and Johnson (1980) also noted that “although Aristotle’s theory of how metaphors work is the classic view, his praise of metaphor’s ability to induce insight was never carried over into modern philosophical thought” (p. 191). In Metaphors We Live By, Lakoff and Johnson (1980) introduced the Conceptual Metaphor Theory, emphasizing the cognitive function of metaphor and pioneering metaphor studies from a cognitive perspective.

Our study is grounded in the Conceptual Metaphor Theory of Lakoff and Johnson (1980). Conceptual metaphor theory pioneers the cognitive perspective in studying metaphors, diverging from traditional rhetorical views. In conceptual metaphor theory, conceptual metaphor is understood as the conceptual mapping from one domain (source domain) onto another domain (target domain). The source domain is typically more concrete or physical, providing familiar experiences that help us comprehend more abstract concepts in the target domain. According to conceptual metaphor theory, the choice of source domain reflects people’s values (Lakoff, 1995). For instance, regarding the metaphor of “life,” different choices of source domain can reveal diverse understandings of life. LIFE (target domain) IS WAR (source domain) and LIFE (target domain) IS A JOURNEY (source domain) are two typical conceptual metaphors. Using WAR as the source domain metaphor places life’s challenges in the role of adversaries, leading to a mindset characterized by defensiveness, hostility, aggressiveness, and anxiety. Conversely, employing JOURNEY as the source domain, metaphor constructs life as a journey, where challenges are seen as unique landscapes, fostering a mindset of tranquility, openness, and broad perspective.

It’s worth noting that a conceptual metaphor in discourse is often realized through linguistic metaphors. Conceptual metaphors focus on the underlying abstract relationships between two concepts but are less concerned with the specific metaphorical words used in particular discourses (Littlemore & Low, 2006). Linguistic metaphors typically refer to metaphorical expressions that appear in concrete discourse (Cameron, 2003). For example, linguistic metaphors such as “Your argument can’t defend itself” “He attacks every weak point in my argument” “I’ve never won an argument with him” and “He’s shattered all my arguments” appear in a discourse. Although, the word “WAR” does not directly appear, by using terms like “defend,” “attacks,” “won,” and “shattered,” along with the topic of “argument,” the author is essentially expressing an abstract conceptual metaphor ARGUMENT (target domain) IS WAR (source domain). Therefore, the analysis of metaphors in discourse involves identifying linguistic metaphors through established metaphor identification procedures, followed by further grouping source domains of these linguistic metaphors to uncover potential conceptual metaphors.

The measurement indicators of metaphor use in discourse often include the frequency of metaphors and the distribution of met aphor source domain groups. The frequency of metaphors refers to the total number of metaphors in the discourse, while the dis tribution of metaphor source domain groups refers to the categories of source domains of metaphors. Some classic source domains deserve special attention in analysis, including WAR, JOURNEY, MONEY, and others. These classic source domains are common and significant elements in people’s daily lives and are often paired with other concepts to form conceptual metaphors. For example, JOURNEY and WAR, as classic source domains, are paired with cancer to form different conceptual metaphors: FACING CANCER IS WAR and FACING CANCER IS A JOURNEY, expressing different mindsets toward dealing with cancer (Demmen et al., 2015). The linguistic metaphors in discourse are as follows: “I am ready for the battle against cancer.” (WAR as the source domain), “We are on a bowel cancer journey.” (JOURNEY as the source domain). However, not all source domains of linguistic metaphors in the discourse can be classified into classic source domains. These linguistic metaphors which cannot be classified as classic source domains can be grouped according to the semantic relationships (Cameron & Low, 2010). For example, the source domain group of “Natural Object” may include specific source domains such as mountains, rivers, and fauna. Grouping source domains in this way is because directly analyzing source domains with relatively few occurrences may lead to uncertain results due to insufficient data.

Traditional metaphor studies on metaphorical sentence generation (Pollio & Smith, 2018) and given topics writing (Yuan & Xu, 2019) often use prompts that explicitly require the use of metaphors to elicit metaphors. However, these prompts can make partici pants more conscious of using metaphors, leading to higher measured metaphor abilities than in spontaneous writing (Gambell, 1981). This makes it difficult to gauge L2 learners’ metaphor use in natural writing. To address this, corpus-based studies of essays in language proficiency tests for L2 learners are receiving increasing attention (Golden, 2021; Wang, 2019).

# 3. Effects of genre and topic on metaphor use in L2 writing

A writing task with a specific topic and genre is often encountered in L2 writing tests to assess students’ writing proficiency. Genre and topic play crucial roles in L2 writing, constraining pragmatic purposes, rhetorical strategies, and vocabulary choices (Kim & Ryoo, 2011; Tardy & Gevers, 2024). In the CFL teaching process, metaphor is often taught as a common rhetorical device, to enhance the persuasiveness and elegance of writing. During metaphor teaching, teachers often use common metaphors as examples, followed by assigning a target domain for students and asking them to choose a relevant source domain to practice creating metaphorical sentences. However, metaphor teaching in CFL does not focus on the relationship between pedagogical genres and metaphors, nor does it consider the relationship between writing topics and the frequency and selection of metaphors currently. Hence, investigating the effects of genre and topic on metaphor use in L2 writing is of great significance. It can help L2 teachers and L2 students understand how different genres and topics differently influence the use of metaphors, and use metaphors appropriately to improve the expressiveness and persuasiveness of their writing.

Since the 1980s, “genre” has become one of the core concepts in understanding L2 acquisition and discourse studies. In current L2 research, the genre is defined by pragmatic goals rather than by linguistic forms and is shaped by specific discourse communities (Tardy & Gevers, 2024; Tardy, 2009). In a discourse community, the speakers (writers) and target audience (readers) share certain language rules and have common goals and interests. In our study, the operational definition of genre specifically refers to pedagogical genres used in the HSK writing exam. The writers are CFL learners, and the target readers are the examiners who grade the HSK exams. Both CFL learners and HSK examiners are familiar with the pragmatic purposes and rules of genres in HSK. Wang (2019) investigated the relationship between genres and metaphor use in L2 writing and found that the frequency of metaphors in argumentative and narrative essays was significantly higher than in letter writing. Wang (2019) attributed the differences in metaphor frequency between genres to the fact that different genres have different pragmatic purposes, and metaphors can meet these pragmatic purposes to varying degrees. In argumentative essays, metaphors, especially conceptual ones, help readers grasp abstract concepts, highlight viewpoints, evoke emotional resonance, and enhance persuasiveness (Chapeton, ´ 2010; Lu, 2021). Dienstbach (2021) also believed that different genres have varying levels of metaphor saturation.

Golden (2021) studied the relationship between topics and metaphor use, finding that more metaphors were produced under the topic of “Friendship” compared to the “Nature of Norway.” Although these two topics share the same classic source domain of VALUABLE COMMODITY, there are still significant differences in the overall source domains used in each topic. Golden (2012) argued that the differences in source domains are largely influenced by the discourse topic. Some studies, while not focused on L2 writing, indicate that topics influence the selection of source domains. For example, in healthcare, WAR as a source domain often conveys determination in battling diseases (Demmen et al., 2015; Gui, 2021; Mohammadi, 2024). In political discourse, FAMILY as a source domain emphasizes government-citizen relationships, likening them to familial bonds to strengthen citizens’ sense of belonging and loyalty to the state (Lakoff, 1995).

Previous studies have revealed some valuable findings. For example, genre and topic will respectively affect the use of metaphors in L2 writing. However, they have not systematically integrated the dimensions of genre and topic to comprehensively examine the use of metaphors in L2 writing. Studying the influence of genre or topic alone on metaphor use can only reveal the independent effect of one factor, overlooking the potential interaction between genre and topic, and it also cannot compare the different influences that genre and topic have on metaphor use. The difference in metaphor use among topics may vary under different genres, and the aspects of metaphor use influenced by genre and topic may also differ. By considering three genres and two topics for each genre, we can understand how L2 learners flexibly adjust the use of metaphors based on different writing tasks.

Therefore, our study aims to investigate the influence of genre and topic on metaphor use in L2 writing by analyzing 900 essays written by 900 CFL learners from the HSK Dynamic Essay Corpus. Our study seeks to deepen our understanding of how genre and topic influence metaphor use in L2 learners’ essays. The research questions are as follows:

RQ1. : What are the differences in metaphor frequency across two topics within three genres, and how do genre and topic inde pendently or interactively shape these differences?

RQ2. : What are the differences in the use of classic source domains across two topics within three genres, and how do genre and topic independently or interactively shape these differences?

# 4. Methodology

In this section, we have presented the corpus data sources and data filtering criteria utilized in our study, along with methods for metaphor identification, grouping rules of metaphor source domains, and analysis methods.

# 4.1. The MHSK corpus

Using a corpus to study metaphor in discourse is a common research method (Cameron & Deignan, 2006; Deignan, 2005; Denroche, 2018; Skorczynska & Deignan, 2006). The essay data of CFL learners in our study was sourced from the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi (HSK, Chinese Proficiency Test) Dynamic Essay Corpus 2.0 (hereafter HSK Corpus), which was compiled and curated by Beijing Language University. The HSK corpus consists of 11,569 written essays from CFL learners participating in the advanced Chinese Proficiency Test between 1992 and 2005, comprising approximately 4.24 million characters (HSK Dynamic Essay Corpus research group, 2018). For more information about the HSK Corpus, see http://hsk.blcu.edu.cn/.

The data used in our study were selected from the HSK Corpus and will be referred to as Metaphor in HSK Corpus (hereafter MHSK corpus). It comprises 900 essays from 900 CFL learners, totaling 341,425 Chinese characters (Tokens). These essays can be divided into three genres, each genre containing two topics. Our study was inspired by Wang (2019), and to align with her research, we included the same three topics with 150 essays each: “How to Face Setback” (argumentative essays), “The Person Who Influenced Me Most” (narrative essays), and “A Letter for Job Application” (letter writing). However, to examine the effect of topic on metaphor use and the interaction between genre and topic, we added one more topic per genre: “My View on Pop Song” (argumentative essays), “One of My Vacations” (narrative essays), and “A Letter to Parents” (letter writing). Hence, the MHSK corpus is divided into six sub-corpora (each sub-corpora corresponds to a topic). Detailed information with six sub-corpora is provided in Table 1. For convenience, the Chinese topic will be referred to by its English name in the subsequent text.

There are two main reasons for choosing these six topics.

(i) These six topics represent typical topics under corresponding genres, and the associated concepts (setbacks, vacations, job applications, letters to parents, pop songs, the person who influenced me most) are important and common. Therefore, they can showcase learners’ metaphor use in daily life.   
(ii) A substantial number of essays by CFL learners are related to these topics, ensuring an adequate amount of data for stratified sampling. Littlemore et al. (2014) found that the writing proficiency of writers influences the use of metaphors in L2 writing. So when comparing metaphor frequency across topics and genres, the interference of L2 writing proficiency must be ruled out. Therefore, our study used a stratified random sampling method to balance the essay scores across different topics, thereby avoiding the influence of writing proficiency. The stratified sampling guarantees the normal distribution $( \mathrm { m i n } = 5 0 $ , $\mathbf { m a x } = 9 5$ ) of essay scores in different sub-corpora, ensuring comparability in metaphor use.

Single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates that there are no significant differences in average essay scores across the six sub-corpora $( \mathrm { F } ( 5 , 8 9 4 ) = 0 . 0 5$ , $p { > } 0 . 0 5$ , $\mathfrak { \eta } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 0 \ )$ . All six sub-corpora passed skewness and kurtosis tests, with absolute values less than 1.96, indicating conformity to a normal distribution. This indicates that the writing proficiency of the six sub-corpora is at the same level.

# 4.2. Metaphor processing

We divide metaphor processing into two stages. In the first stage, we use the Metaphor Identification Procedure VU University Amsterdam (MIPVU) procedure to identify metaphor-related words and extract the metaphor sentences, preserving contextual in formation. In the second stage, we categorize the identified source domain words into six groups, including two classic source domains (WAR and JOURNEY) and four general source domains.

# 4.2.1. Metaphor identification

We manually analyzed the 900 essays to identify and tag metaphorical sentences and words. Metaphors were identified at the word level using the MIPVU (Steen et al., 2010). The main steps are as follows:

(i) Identify metaphor-related words by examining the text word by word.   
(ii) If a word is not used in its basic or literal sense and can be explained through cross-domain mapping, mark it as a source domain word, as in Example (1):

(1) 她在钓取赞美。

(“She is fishing for compliments”) In Example (1), 钓(fishing) is used metaphorically, not literally, to describe seeking compliments, with 钓(fishing) as the

metaphor’s source domain.

(i) When a word forms a cross-domain mapping with another word in the context, mark both as metaphorical words (source domain and target domain), as shown in Example (2):

(2) 她的微笑就像寒冷日子里的一条温暖的毯子。

(“Her smile was a warm blanket on a cold day”)

In Example (2), 微笑(smile) and 毯子(blanket) form a cross-domain mapping, with 微笑(smile) as the target domain and 毯子 (blanket) as the source domain of the metaphor.

Two PhD linguistics students conducted the metaphor identification, resolving any discrepancies with a senior professor. All metaphorical sentences and words were stored in Excel spreadsheets, with annotations indicating their sub-corpus sources, supporting the next qualitative analysis of metaphor use and its connection to topics.

# 4.2.2. Source domain grouping

After identifying all linguistic metaphors, we group their source domains. Classic source domains like WAR, JOURNEY, and MONEY are significant, as they frequently form conceptual metaphors in daily life. For metaphors whose source domains are not classic, we follow Cameron and Low’s (2010) approach and group them based on semantic relatedness.

By analyzing the source domains of linguistic metaphors across six topics, we identified two classic domains: WAR and JOURNEY. These two classic source domains appear frequently in some topics but rarely in others, thus warranting qualitative analyses of their relationship with the topics. Other source domains were grouped by semantic relatedness into two categories (four groups): peoplerelated (Human Body, Social Role) and object-related (Natural Object, Artificial Object). This resulted in six source domain groups. Table 2 presents six source domain groups with representative Chinese source domain words and their English translations in parentheses.

The relationship between metaphorical sentences, source domain words, and source domain groups is demonstrated in Example (3).

(3) 母亲在我生命中给我极大的影响，引导我迈向人生的大道。

(“Mother has had a significant impact on my life, guiding me along the avenue of life.”)

Example (3) contains a linguistic metaphor where 大道(avenue) is used metaphorically to represent “life” rather than a literal road. 大道(avenue) serves as the source domain for the conceptual metaphor LIFE IS A JOURNEY. Among the six source domain groups, 大道 (avenue) aligns with the JOURNEY group, making it a representative metaphor source domain word for that group.

Two PhD linguistics students classified and coded the source domains of 685 linguistic metaphors across six topics. Of these, 647 source domains were assigned to the most relevant source domain group, with an inter-rater reliability of $9 4 . 5 ~ \%$ . The discrepancies between the two coders arose from classifying Chinese idioms and proverbs as source domains. Idioms often stem from ancient stories with deep cultural meaning, while proverbs reflect folk wisdom, usually lacking a clear origin. When used as metaphors, their source domains are hard to classify into a single group due to their complexity. After discussion, the coders agreed not to classify the remaining 38 idiom-related and proverb-related metaphors into the existing six source domain groups.

# 4.3. Metaphor analysis

# 4.3.1. Normalized frequency

Since different sub-corpora have varying token counts, larger sub-corpora may contain more metaphors. To address this, we considered both raw frequency (RF) and normalized frequency per 1000 tokens (NF), following Demmen et al. (2015). Normalizing the frequency mitigates the impact of text length, allowing for more accurate comparisons of metaphor use across corpora.

The NF is calculated as follows: ${ \mathrm { N F } } = { \frac { \mathrm { R F ~ o f ~ m e t a p h o r s } } { \mathrm { T o k e n s ~ o f ~ c o r p u s } } } \times 1 0 0 0$

# 4.3.2. Quantitative analysis of metaphors

To conduct a quantitative analysis of metaphor frequency differences across sub-corpora, we used the chi-square test, assuming equal metaphor probability across sub-corpora. However, varying sub-corpora sizes make direct RF comparisons biased. Therefore, we accounted for token counts when calculating the expected metaphor frequency. The formulas are as follows:

Observed Frequency $= \operatorname { R F }$ of metaphors in a specific sub-corpus

# 4.3.3. Qualitative analysis of metaphors

Different topics may prefer different conceptual metaphors. Analyzing the potential conceptual metaphors by classic source do mains is a common approach, as seen in Demmen et al. (2015). In the qualitative analysis, we examined metaphorical sentences related to the classic source domain in a certain topic in order to discover the relationship between the use of conceptual metaphors and the topic. The steps are as follows:

(i) Select the classic source domains for qualitative analysis, such as WAR.   
(ii) Extract representative metaphor sentences related to these source domains within specific topics. For example, to examine the WAR domain in the topic “How to Face Setback,” see Example (4).   
(4) 生活原来就是一场斗争。   
(“Life is a struggle.”)   
(i) Analyze the target domain, metaphor meaning, and its connection to the topic. In Example (4), the target domain is 生活(Life) and the source domain is 斗争(Struggle), reflecting the conceptual metaphor LIFE IS WAR. This implies that life is full of challenges and hardships, akin to war. The metaphor aligns with the topic “How to Face Setback,” highlighting the need for resilience and a fighting spirit in overcoming difficulties.

# 5. Results

# 5.1. Quantitative analysis of metaphors

Table 3 presents the RF and NF of metaphors by genre and topic.

We identified 685 linguistic metaphors in total. Metaphor frequency is highest in argumentative essays $( \mathrm { R F } = 4 7 6$ , $\mathrm { N F } = 4 . 0 7 $ ), followed by narrative essays $[ \mathrm { R F } = 1 5 2 $ , $\mathrm { N F } = 1 . 2 6 ) $ , with the lowest in letter writing $\mathrm { R F } = 5 7$ , $\mathbf { N F } = 0 . 5 5 $ . A chi-square test confirmed a significant difference across genres $( p < . 0 0 1$ , 2df, $\chi ^ { 2 } = 3 9 1 . 6 2 )$ . Further tests revealed that metaphors in argumentative essays significantly exceeded those in narrative essays $( p < . 0 0 1$ , 1df, $\chi ^ { 2 } = 1 7 6 . 1 5 $ ) and letter writing $( p < . 0 0 1$ , 1df, $\chi ^ { 2 } = 2 8 3 . 6 7 )$ , while narrative essays also surpassed letter writing $( p < . 0 0 1$ , 1df, $\chi ^ { 2 } = 3 0 . 8 4 )$ .

When comparing the metaphor frequency across the six topics, “How to Face Setback” ranks the highest, significantly more than the other topics. “The Person Who Influenced Me Most” comes in second, significantly lower than the highest but higher than the other four topics. “My View on Pop Song” ranks third, significantly lower than the first and second, but significantly higher than the remaining three topics. The metaphor frequencies of the last three topics, “One of My Vacations,” “A Letter to Parents,” and “A Letter for Job Application,” show no significant differences.

Table 4 shows the chi-square test results comparing metaphor use across two topics within three genres. Significant differences were found across topics in both argumentative essays and narrative essays. In argumentative essays, “How to Face Setback” had significantly more metaphors than “My View on Pop Songs.” Similarly, in narrative essays, the frequency of metaphors in “The Person Who Influenced Me Most” exceeded “One of My Vacations.” However, in letter writing, no significant difference was found between “A Letter to Parents” and “A Letter for Job Application,” with both having RFs below 40. These results suggest an interaction between genre and topic.

Setback,” “The Person Who Influenced Me Most,” and “A Letter to Parents.” In “How to Face Setback,” WAR is used as frequently as the general source domains.

Table 6 presents chi-square test results for JOURNEY-related and WAR-related metaphors across two topics within three genres. JOURNEY-related metaphors differ significantly across topics within all three genres, while WAR-related metaphors show significant differences only in argumentative essays.

In this section, we move from analyzing metaphor frequency to examining the meaning and function of metaphors. While we classified six source domain groups, we focus on comparing the frequency and function of the classic domains JOURNEY and WAR across two topics within three genres. This is because the frequent occurrence of these two classic source domains may be related to certain conceptual metaphors. The qualitative analysis aims to explore the deeper connections between conceptual metaphors (JOURNEY or WAR as source domain groups) and the genres and topics.

# 5.2.1. JOURNEY-related and WAR-related metaphors in argumentative essays

Fig. 1 shows the NF of JOURNEY-related and WAR-related metaphors across topics within argumentative essays. Both JOURNEYrelated and WAR-related metaphors appear significantly more often in “How to Face Setback” than in “My View on Pop Song.” However, JOURNEY-related metaphors are significantly more frequent than WAR-related metaphors in “How to Face Setback.” To explore why these metaphors are frequent in this topic, qualitative analysis of relevant examples is needed.

Fig. 1. JOURNEY-related and WAR-related metaphors in argumentative essays.

(i) JOURNEY as a source domain: Setbacks are linked to the conceptual metaphor LIFE IS A JOURNEY and FACING SETBACKS IS A JOURNEY. JOURNEY metaphors portray setbacks as obstacles on a path and reflect the mindset changes when facing them, as seen in Examples (5) to (7).

Fig. 2. JOURNEY-related and WAR-related metaphors in narrative essays.

(5) 我的人生的道路很坎坷，遇到了不少挫折和困难。 (“The path of my life is very uneven, encountering numerous setbacks and difficulties.”)   
(6) 当时的我的状态与其说是留在原地，还不如说是倒退。 (“At that time, my state was more like staying in place than moving backward.”)   
(7) 我希望所有在挫折中的人都能坚强地站起来。

(“I hope everyone facing setbacks can stand up resiliently.”)

In Example (5), life is depicted as a path, with setbacks as uneven stretches, related to the conceptual metaphor LIFE IS A JOURNEY. Example (6) uses foot actions, like staying in place or moving backward, to metaphorically represent retreating when faced with setbacks. Example (7) compares encountering setbacks to falling on a rough path, emphasizing the need to stand up and move forward, symbolizing resilience after sadness. Examples (6) to (7) illustrate two representative metaphors of FACING SETBACKS IS A JOURNEY, showing a logical progression when facing setbacks.

(i) WAR as a source domain: Setbacks are also linked to the conceptual metaphor FACING SETBACKS IS WAR, where setbacks are seen as opponents, and facing them is likened to a battle. See Examples (8) to (9):

(8) 希望挫折不会把你打倒。(“Hope setbacks won’t knock you down.”)(9) 在社会中,尚不知会遇到何种挫折，我却已作好迎战的准备。

(“In society, not knowing what setbacks may be encountered, I am already prepared to go to battle.”)

WAR-related metaphors seem to emphasize a combative attitude in dealing with setbacks, suggesting the need for strategies to overcome setbacks.

5.2.2. JOURNEY-related and WAR-related metaphors in narrative essays

Fig. 2 shows the NF of JOURNEY-related and WAR-related metaphors across topics within narrative essays. JOURNEY-related metaphors in “The Person Who Influenced Me Most” occur significantly more frequently than in “One of My Vacations,” while WAR-related metaphors are nearly absent $( \mathrm { N F } < 0 . 1 \ )$ ) in both topics. To understand the frequent use of JOURNEY-related metaphors in “The Person Who Influenced Me the Most,” qualitative analysis is needed.

JOURNEY as a source domain: It depicts life as a journey where the influential person provides guidance, as seen in Examples (10) to (11).

![](img/75d414682a28a632ff5f2dfe8838163817e9fa5efed7622659d685a17e7cad71.jpg)  
Fig. 3. JOURNEY-related and WAR-related metaphors in letter writing.

(10) 我感到很高兴，在我人生漫长的旅途中，能有这么样的一位良师。(“I feel grateful to have such an excellent mentor on the long journey of my life.”)(11) 对我的人生之路的选择，我的父亲起了重要的作用。

(“My father played a crucial role in shaping the choices on my life’s path.”)

In Example (10), the person is depicted as a guide encountered on life’s journey. Example (11) highlights the influence of this important person on the choices I made in choosing my life path. These JOURNEY-related metaphors closely align with the topic “The Person Who Influenced Me Most,” effectively illustrating the person’s impact on my life path through the metaphor LIFE AS A JOURNEY.

5.2.3. JOURNEY-related and WAR-related metaphors in letter writing

Fig. 3 displays the NF of JOURNEY-related and WAR-related metaphors across topics within letter writing. JOURNEY-related metaphors occur more frequently in “A Letter to Parents” than in “A Letter for Job Application,” while WAR-related metaphors are nearly absent $( \mathrm { N F } < 0 . 1 )$ ) in both topics. To explore the frequent use of JOURNEY-related metaphors in “A Letter to Parents,” qualitative analysis is needed.

JOURNEY as a source domain: It portrays life and learning as a journey, as seen in Example (12) and (13).

(12) 我劝你们别过于难过，别为我们三个孩子担心，我们毕竟长大了，自己的路自己走。 (“I urge you not to be too sad and not to worry too much about the three of us. After all, we’ve grown up and will walk our own paths.”)   
(13) 我希望学习进步，还希望您的事业也顺利。

(“I hope to take a step forward in my studies and also wish for your career to go smoothly.”)

Example (12) uses the LIFE IS A JOURNEY metaphor to express the determination to choose one’s own path in life and to reassure the parents not to worry. Example (13) uses the LEARNING IS A JOURNEY metaphor to express a desire for academic progress, depicting growth as moving along a path. In both examples, JOURNEY metaphors closely align with the topic “A Letter to Parents,” reflecting the writer’s identity as a CFL learner studying in China, and expectations for learning.

# 6. Discussion

# 6.1. Answers to research questions

6.1.1. The influence of genre and topic on metaphor frequency

Our study found that genre differences in writing purposes influence metaphor use. Like previous studies (Chapeton, ´ 2010; Lu, 2021; Wang, 2019), we believe that in argumentative essays, conceptual metaphors help readers understand abstract ideas, emphasize viewpoints, evoke emotions, and increase persuasiveness. Narrative essays use metaphors to create vivid scenes and characters, making the writing more engaging. In contrast, letters, such as job applications, require a practical and concise style. Overuse of metaphors in such contexts may lead to misunderstandings or negative impressions, resulting in the lowest metaphor frequency among the three genres.

In addition, we found that “The Person Who Influenced Me Most” (a narrative topic linked to the conceptual metaphor LIFE IS A JOURNEY) has a higher metaphor frequency than “My View on Pop Song” (an argumentative topic with no connection to conceptual metaphors). This suggests that genre’s influence on metaphor use is not absolute, and certain topics tied to conceptual metaphors can override this pattern, highlighting the significant role of the topic in influencing metaphor frequency.

This study also found an interaction effect between genre and topic on metaphor use. There are significant differences in metaphor frequency across two topics within argumentative essays and narrative essays, but not within letter writing. This finding may result from that fact that the higher frequency of metaphors in argumentative essays and narrative essays makes topic-related differences more pronounced, whereas the lowest frequency in letter writing makes these differences less noticeable.

In conclusion, both genre and topic influence the frequency of metaphors, but for different reasons. Topic influences metaphor frequency by being linked to conceptual metaphors, generating a large number of related linguistic metaphors. Genre affects metaphor frequency due to varying pragmatic purposes. In addition, in genres with high metaphor frequency, the differences in metaphor frequency between topics become more pronounced.

6.1.2. The influence of genre and topic on the use of classic source domains

We found that genre affects the frequency, not the selection, of classic source domains. The WAR source domain appears only in the argumentative topic “How to Face Setback,” not in the other argumentative topic or other genres, indicating that source domain selection is driven by the topic rather than the genre. Moreover, genre moderates the frequency of classic source domains only when there is a connection between the topic and the conceptual metaphor. If there is no such connection, genre cannot influence the frequency of classic source domains. Therefore, the genre’s moderating effect on classic source domains’ frequency depends on the relationship between the topic and the conceptual metaphor.

We also found that the significant differences in the use of classic source domains differ from the overall frequency of metaphor. In the overall frequency of metaphor, this difference was significant only in argumentative and narrative essays, not in letter writing.

However, we found that in terms of the use of classic source domains, one topic in each genre is linked to conceptual metaphors and has a higher metaphor frequency, while the other is not linked to conceptual metaphors and has a lower metaphor frequency. The dif ference in the use of classic source domains across two topics is significant in all three genres. This suggests that the pattern of higher metaphor frequency driven by the use of conceptual metaphors still holds, but it can be obscured by genres with the lowest overall metaphor frequency (letter writing).

In summary, we believe that genre influences the frequency of classic source domains when there is a connection between the topic and the conceptual metaphor. The selection of classic source domains and the underlying conceptual metaphors are more closely related to the topic. Additionally, topic also influences the frequency of classic source domains.

# 6.2. Comparison with previous research findings

Our study found that CFL learners use metaphors more frequently in argumentative and narrative essays than in letter writing, consistent with Wang (2019). However, while Wang found no significant difference between argumentative and narrative essays, our results show that metaphors are significantly more frequent in argumentative essays. We believe this is because argumentative essays more readily activate the cognitive function of metaphors compared to narrative essays. Our study supports the strong link between genre and metaphor as a rhetorical strategy, consistent with the view that different genres have specific rhetorical functions tailored to their communicative purposes and readers’ needs (Tardy & Gevers, 2024; Tardy, 2009).

We found that topics influence not only metaphor frequency but also the choice of classic source domains. Learners used metaphors more frequently in some topics than others, and different topics may activate the same classic source domains. This aligns with Golden (2021), who noted that two topics “friendship” and “nature” shared the classic source domain VALUABLE COMMODITY. However, Golden did not compare the frequency of classic source domains across topics, only providing examples. In contrast, our study quantitatively analyzed classic source domain frequency, revealing that while different topics may activate the same classic source domain, the activation level varies. The difference in activation levels may be due to the combined influence of both genre and topic. These findings enhance our understanding of the link between topics, genres, and conceptual metaphors.

# 6.3. Contribution to conceptual metaphor theory

We focused on classic source domains to identify potential conceptual metaphors and explore their connection to essay topics. The qualitative analysis shows that frequent use of the JOURNEY and WAR source domains is tied to specific topics, triggering related conceptual metaphors. Our study found that the relationship between topics and conceptual metaphors is influenced by the connection between the topic and the target domain of the conceptual metaphor, as well as the values the author intends to express.

Firstly, our study extends conceptual metaphor theory by showing that essay topics can be systematically linked to related conceptual metaphors. For the phenomenon of conceptual metaphors appearing frequently in some topics, we believe there are two reasons: on one hand, these topics are connected to relevant target domains, and on the other hand, the author intends to use conceptual metaphors to express certain abstract values under the given topic. For example, “How to Face Setback” and “The Person Who Influenced Me the Most” both activate the conceptual metaphor LIFE IS A JOURNEY, as “Setback” and “The Person Who Influenced Me the Most” are key aspects of “life.” In addition, the author’s intent to express certain values under a specific topic can also influence the use of conceptual metaphors, particularly affecting the choice and frequency of classic source domains. For example, “How to Face Setback” activates the conceptual metaphor FACING SETBACKS IS WAR and FACING SETBACKS IS A JOURNEY. However, the fre quency of WAR metaphors is much lower than that of JOURNEY metaphors, reflecting different preferences of values. This suggests that while the essay topic-target domain connection is important, the author’s intent in a specific topic to express certain values through metaphors plays a more crucial role in determining the choice and frequency of classic source domains.

Secondly, conceptual metaphor theory links different source domain choices for the same target domain to the expression of different values, but it rarely explores preferences for different values. In our study, both FACING SETBACKS IS WAR and FACING SETBACKS IS A JOURNEY metaphors were common in the topic “How to Face Setback,” reflecting two different attitudes: setbacks as rough patches on the journey of life (a more calm and optimistic perspective), or as enemies to be defeated (a more tense and combative perspective). However, JOURNEY-related metaphors were used more frequently than WAR, suggesting the group’s dominant values. In future scenarios where values are not directly reported, the choice of metaphor source domains can serve as an indirect way to observe the values of certain groups.

Finally, we found that relationships between certain conceptual metaphors align with syllogistic reasoning. Traditionally, meta phor has been viewed as a form of analogical reasoning parallel to syllogistic logic. For example, Frost (1996) noted that metaphors provide cognitive insights that go beyond syllogistic reasoning. However, when the major premise itself is a conceptual metaphor, the conclusion derived can lead to the generation of another conceptual metaphor. For example, we found the simultaneous use of the conceptual metaphors LIFE IS A JOURNEY and LEARNING IS A JOURNEY under the topic of “A Letter to Parents.” Although both use JOURNEY as the source domain, the target domains are different, with one being LIFE and the other being LEARNING. These two target domains are somewhat related, as LEARNING is a part of LIFE. Similarly, we found that the topic “How to Face Setback” simultaneously activates both LIFE IS A JOURNEY and FACING SETBACKS IS A JOURNEY. These two target domains are somewhat related, as FACING SETBACKS is a part of LIFE.

This suggests that conceptual metaphors may follow the principles of syllogistic reasoning. A syllogism is a form of deductive reasoning that arrives at a conclusion by connecting two premises. For example:

Major premise: All living beings will die.

Minor premise: Humans are living beings.   
Conclusion: Humans will die.   
In conceptual metaphors, we can observe a similar structure: Major premise: LIFE IS A JOURNEY.   
Minor premise: LEARNING/FACING SETBACKS is a part of LIFE.   
Conclusion: LEARNING/FACING SETBACKS IS A JOURNEY.

This suggests that conceptual metaphors do not exist independently but rather form an interconnected system of conceptual metaphors. In this system, each conceptual metaphor proposition is linked to other conceptual metaphors, thereby creating a broader cognitive network. Notably, this conceptual metaphor system differs from the traditional view of conceptual metaphor’s systematicity in conceptual metaphor theory (where multiple linguistic metaphors revolve around a conceptual metaphor). This finding expands the understanding of conceptual metaphor’s systematicity in conceptual metaphor theory, moving from a focus on relationships between conceptual metaphors and linguistic metaphors to include connections between conceptual metaphors themselves.

# 6.4. Pedagogical implications

Firstly, our results help teachers understand that metaphors’ cognitive and rhetorical functions support the pragmatic goals of different genres. Instead of merely instructing students to use more or fewer metaphors, teachers should explain each genre’s prag matic purpose and how metaphors can achieve these aims. Examples from various genres can show students how metaphors are used to meet these goals. This approach helps students grasp the practical application of metaphors, and sharpen their awareness of genrespecific purposes, enabling them to make more genre-appropriate and flexible metaphor choices.

Secondly, when teaching metaphors in writing based on a specific genre and topic, it’s not about the frequency of metaphors, but their appropriateness. For example, while letter writing has the lowest frequency of metaphors, using metaphors effectively can still help convey the author’s intent. In the topic “A Letter for Job Application,” employing the metaphor “了如指掌(know something clearly just like point the back of your hand)” can demonstrate a strong command of language and confidence, leaving a positive impression on the recruiter. Therefore, the suitability of using metaphors depends on their appropriate use and alignment with the context and communicative purpose of the writer.

Thirdly, teachers can help students link essay topics to the conceptual metaphors they’ve learned. Traditional metaphor instruction usually focuses on a clear target domain, asking students to choose different source domains to show different values. However, exam topics often don’t align with the target domain of practiced metaphors in class. By guiding students to find connections between essay topics and learned target domains of conceptual metaphors, teachers encourage flexible application of conceptual metaphors. This approach helps students use metaphors effectively in their writing of new topics.

Finally, while we highlight the influence of genre and topic on metaphor use, this doesn’t mean the author’s personal style should be overlooked. Strong writing balances genre and topic requirements with the author’s unique style. Metaphors, as both rhetorical and cognitive tools, are essential for conveying personal style.

# 6.5. Research limitations and future prospects

Firstly, as our data comes from the HSK corpus, we couldn’t strictly control variables. Future research could assess the effect of genre on metaphor use by comparing the same topic (e.g., “setback”) across genres, such as argumentative essays “How to Face Setback,” narrative essays “One of My Setbacks,” and letter writing “A Letter to My Friend (encouraging him to overcome setbacks).” Additionally, we only examined two topics within each genre. Future studies could explore more common L2 writing topics for a broader understanding of how topics influence the use of conceptual metaphors.

Secondly, writing prompts can influence metaphor use (Gambell, 1981; Golden, 2021). Although we believe that the essay prompts in the HSK corpus do not intentionally induce metaphor usage, we are unable to prove this. In the HSK corpus, only the title and body text are provided without explicit prompts, so we cannot determine whether prompts affected metaphor use in our study.

Finally, we focused on the influence of genre and topic on the metaphor use, without considering other potential factors such as L1 background, age, gender, L2 proficiency, and time. For example, the time of the six topics in our study ranges from 1993 to 2005, and the varying times of different topics may affect the use of metaphors. Future research could explore how these factors impact metaphor use among CFL learners.

# 7. Conclusions

In summary, both genre and topic influence CFL learners’ use of metaphors, but in different ways. At the same time, there is an interaction between genre and topic.

Our study provides valuable insights into conceptual metaphor theory. Firstly, we identified two conditions for using conceptual metaphors in a specific topic: (1) The topic is linked to the target domains of conceptual metaphors, and (2) the author wants to use metaphors to convey abstract values. Secondly, differences in source domain frequency within the same target domain can reflect a group’s value preferences. Finally, certain conceptual metaphor relationships follow syllogistic reasoning, supporting the existence of a conceptual metaphor system and broadening the traditional view of systematicity in conceptual metaphor theory.

Our study has practical implications for CFL writing instruction. Firstly, teachers can teach how metaphors support the pragmatic goals of different genres. Secondly, teachers can help students link essay topics with conceptual metaphors they have learned, enabling them to apply these learned metaphors to new topics. Thirdly, the metaphor teaching focus should be on appropriateness rather than frequency. Finally, we encourage the use of metaphors to express personal style while respecting genre and topic requirements.

Our study has some limitations. (1) We couldn’t compare metaphor use across genres with the same topic. (2) We couldn’t assess how much writing prompts may have influenced metaphor use. (3) We didn’t consider other factors like L1 background, age, gender, L2 proficiency, and time, which future research could explore further.
