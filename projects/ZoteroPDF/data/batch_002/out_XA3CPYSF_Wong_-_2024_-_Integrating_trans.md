# ABSTRACT

While existing literature highlights the need to integrate translanguaging into assessments, its classroom application remains understudied. Adopting a participatory research approach, this study illustrates (1) how translanguaging was incorporated into formative assessments in a Chinese immersion context and (2) the perspectives of both the teacher and students regarding the assessments. The teacher and I co-designed formative assessments, integrating them into the translanguaging instruction design cycle (García, O., S. I. Johnson, and K. Seltzer. 2017. The Translanguaging Classroom: Leveraging Student Bilingualism for Learning. Carlson: Multilingual Matters) for an academic unit. The data included notes from co-planning sessions, classroom observations, artifacts, and transcripts of interviews with the teacher and students. The results demonstrate that the teacher and students mobilized various communicative resources to assess and demonstrate knowledge. The teacher also skillfully integrated the gradual release model into the implementation of the assessments to scaffold students’ progression. These formative assessments offered insights into student learning and allowed them to leverage multilingualism in a co-learning environment. The students reported positive experiences with the assessments. Not only did they apply the key concepts learned within the unit but also developed confidence, expanded proficiency in Chinese, and acquired an appreciation for other languages. Based on these findings, practical recommendations for incorporating translanguaging into formative assessments are discussed.

# Introduction

Translanguaging has received a great deal of attention as a result of the multilingual turn in language education (Prada and Turnbull 2018). Scholars have attempted to conceptualize the term and highlighted its importance with an aim to normalize multilingualism in school settings (García and Li 2014). As a theory, translanguaging describes ‘the deployment of a speaker’s full linguistic repertoire without regard for watchful adherence to the socially and politically defined boundaries of named languages’ (Otheguy, García, and Reid 2015, 283). It involves language users utilizing the most suitable linguistic elements to effectively convey a message to a recipient (García and Otheguy 2020). In other words, it disputes the ideology of language separation and emphasizes the natural language use of bilinguals to make sense of the world. Thus, translanguaging is grounded in the principle that emergent bi/multilinguals’ (EMLs) language practices are dynamic and fluid, reflecting a holistic linguistic repertoire rather than separate language systems. This approach recognizes that EMLs navigate and utilize their linguistic resources to meet communicative needs, challenging traditional notions of distinct and unified language systems (García, Johnson, and Seltzer 2017; Li 2011).

As a pedagogy, translanguaging aims to utilize students’ bi/multilingualism as an asset in the knowledge construction process through multilingual, multimodal, and multi-sensory sources (Cenoz and Gorter 2021; Li 2018). As an instructional approach, pedagogical translanguaging allows teachers to draw on EMLs’ language practices in the process of expanding content and language development through planned strategies that are intentional and purposeful (Cenoz and Gorter 2021; Li 2018). An important component of translanguaging pedagogy is assessment since instruction and assessment are closely tied together (García, Johnson, and Seltzer 2017). Through pedagogical translanguaging, teachers create a space for EMLs to bring their full linguistic repertoires, lived experiences, beliefs, and ideas into the meaning-making process in learning and assessment (Ascenzi-Moreno 2018; García, Johnson, and Seltzer 2017; Lopez, Turkan, and Guzman-Orth 2017).

Studies have examined how teachers enact pedagogical translanguaging in diverse contexts (Tai 2023; Tai and Li 2020; Tai and Wong 2022; Tian 2022; Wong 2024; Wong and Tai 2023). These studies provide examples of how teachers used planned strategies and various resources to support students’ learning in content and language integrated learning (CLIL) classrooms. Although research related to translanguaging is growing rapidly, studies that focus on its implementation are still sparse (Cenoz and Gorter 2022). More specifically, while the literature has indicated the problem of using a monolingual approach for assessment, research investigating how teachers conduct assessment in a translanguaging space is scarce. This line of research is important and necessary as instruction and assessment are strongly related. Thus, adopting the form of participatory design research (Tracy 2020), the purpose of this study is to provide an account of how a CLIL teacher incorporated translanguaging pedagogy in formative assessments within an academic unit for her EMLs in a Chinese immersion setting. I also aimed to explore the perspectives of both the teacher and students to provide a broader picture of the assessments described in the study. Two questions guided this study.

RQ 1: How does a CLIL teacher incorporate translanguaging pedagogy in formative assessments in a Chinese immersion classroom?

RQ 2: What are the perceptions of the teacher and students on the translanguaging assessments in enhancing multilingualism and content understanding in a Chinese immersion classroom?

# Research on translanguaging

Numerous scholarly inquiries have reported how teachers naturally employed translanguaging in diverse settings (Gort and Pontier 2013; Ho and Tai 2021; Tai 2023; Zheng 2021). Studies have also begun to explore how teachers implement translanguaging based on their pedagogical knowledge through teacher preparation courses (Tai and Wong 2022; Wong 2024; Wong and Tai 2023). This research illustrates that teachers skillfully utilized various resources to connect students’ language and cultural practices as well as everyday experiences. These findings suggest that not only did translanguaging affirm students’ bilingual identities (Wong 2024; Wong and Tai 2023), but it prompted native English speaking students’ appreciation of language diversity in the society (Tai and Wong 2022). However, a prevalent assumption in the literature and practice of translanguaging could be that integrating translanguaging naturally leads to enhanced understanding and appreciation of multilingualism among students, with little or no emphasis on the effectiveness of these practices in facilitating students’ true learning and critical thinking skills.

In addition, scholars have collaborated with practicing teachers to narrow the gap between research and practice (e.g. Tian 2022; Tian and Lau 2022). For instance, by adopting a participatory design approach, Tian (2022) partnered with a Chinese language arts teacher to co-create a translanguaging space within a dual language classroom. This partnership yielded positive outcomes in areas such as student engagement and learning, as well as enhancing connections between families and schools. However, despite these benefits, there is a noticeable absence of focus on how translanguaging informs assessment practices, a critical component of teaching and learning.

Moreover, numerous studies have explored students’ experiences and perspectives on translanguaging, indicating that students’ language ideologies significantly influence their linguistic choices (Canals 2021; Cenoz, Santos, and Gorter 2022; Daniel and Pacheco 2016; Lau, Dault, and Thebérge 2023; Shi 2023; Wang and East 2023). Additionally, these choices appear to be shaped by their peers’ language proficiency (Shi 2023) and their personal attitudes towards school and home languages (Daniel and Pacheco 2016). While these findings highlight the benefits of translanguaging practices in CLIL settings, such as facilitating student learning, motivation, reducing anxiety, and strengthening community connections, they often overlook a critical examination of assessment practices. This gap in the literature suggests a need for an investigation of how translanguaging is integrated into assessments to reflect and support the EMLs’ language practices and to develop a holistic view of translanguaging pedagogy.

# Translanguaging and formative assessment for EMLs

Formative assessment has gained increased recognition as an effective tool for enhancing both teaching and learning (Gu and Lam 2023). Teachers employ this type of classroom assessment to monitor students’ learning progress and provide ongoing feedback. This feedback is instrumental in refining teaching strategies and enabling students to improve their learning. Formative assessments are designed to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement in student understanding. They are conducted regularly throughout the instructional process, serving as a critical component of effective pedagogy (Brown and Lee 2017; Herrera, Murray, and Cabral 2019). Performance-based assessment, a form of formative assessments, evaluates students’ ability to apply knowledge and skills within real-world contexts (Brown and Lee 2017; Herrera, Murray, and Cabral 2019).

The integration of translanguaging into formative assessments represents a paradigm shift towards more inclusive and representative evaluation methods. Translanguaging assessments leverage students’ entire linguistic and cultural repertoires, enabling a more holistic assessment of their content knowledge and abilities (González 2012; Jessner and Kramsch 2015). Such approaches are particularly beneficial for EMLs, for whom traditional assessments may not fully capture their understanding or creativity (Wang and East 2023). By incorporating multilingual and multimodal resources, translanguaging assessments validate and affirm students’ identities as bilingual individuals and provide a richer picture of their competencies and learning achievements.

Key to translanguaging in assessment is its focus on utilizing EMLs’ language practices and lived experiences as assets rather than barriers, emphasizing what students can achieve with their full linguistic repertoires (Ascenzi-Moreno 2018; García, Johnson, and Seltzer 2017). Scholars (e.g. Gracia and Kleyn 2016; Lopez, Turkan, and Guzman-Orth 2017) advocate for embracing EMLs’ diverse linguistic resources for meaning making and negotiation in assessments. This approach not only documents EMLs’ knowledge and skills but also champions their bilingual identities, contributing to a more inclusive and equitable assessment practice (Fine 2022; Seltzer and García 2020; Wang and East 2023).

To guide teachers in weaving translanguaging into their classrooms, García, Johnson, and Seltzer (2017) outline a five-stage translanguaging instructional design cycle: ‘explorar,’ ‘evaluar,’ ‘imaginar,’ ‘presentar,’ and ‘implementar’ (72). This framework aids teachers in designing instruction that harnesses students’ full linguistic capabilities. From providing background knowledge to empowering students with purposeful actions, each stage enriches the learning experience with translanguaging practices. Expanding on the instructional framework for successful translanguaging integration in classroom assessments, the authors propose four principles for incorporating translanguaging into assessments. First, they advocate considering the perspectives of teachers, students, peers, and families to comprehensively evaluate students’ abilities in both content and language.

Second, they recommend that teachers provide opportunities for students to demonstrate their knowledge by utilizing various sources, including people and tools. Third, assessments should consist of authentic, performance-based tasks. Lastly, assessments should ensure that students have the opportunity to express their knowledge and skills using their full linguistic repertoires (García, Johnson, and Seltzer 2017). This approach to formative assessment complements the translanguaging design cycle by continuously monitoring and supporting students’ content learning and language development.

However, there have been limited studies specifically exploring how teachers apply translanguaging strategies within their assessment practices. Considering the context-specific nature of pedagogical translanguaging (Cenoz and Gorter 2022), there is a pressing need for more research to provide concrete examples from various educational settings, especially regarding the integration of translanguaging into formative assessments. Addressing these research gaps, this study aims to provide an in-depth examination of how a CLIL teacher has incorporated translanguaging strategies in assessments. Specifically, I examined how formative assessments were embedded within the design cycle and explored the perspectives of both the students and teacher regarding these assessments. The critical gap addressed by this study involves moving beyond the mere incorporation of translanguaging as a pedagogical tool towards a deeper understanding of its impact on student learning, particularly in formative assessments.

# Researcher’s positionality

My multilingual identity along with my role as a teacher educator has guided the focus and methodology of this study. My understanding of the need to normalize multilingual education motivated me to explore how translanguaging pedagogy is incorporated into classroom assessments. My expertise in translanguaging pedagogy, coupled with a goal to bridge research and practice informed my choice of a participatory research approach. This methodology enabled active collaboration with the teacher and aligned with my belief in co-constructed knowledge. During the data analysis phase, my background as a multilingual individual led me to pay special attention to the ways in which language flexibility was manifested in assessments. Finally, my position as a teacher educator also informed the interpretation of my findings, the conclusions I drew, and the recommendations I offered.

# Methodology

The present study took place in a 5th grade (G5) classroom at Stars Academy,1 a Chinese immersion school located on the East Coast of the United States. Employing a participatory approach (Tracy 2020), I collaborated closely with a CLIL teacher (Ms. Zhou) in the school. Rooted in constructivist epistemology, this approach involves both researchers and participants contributing to the teaching and learning process, with the aim of enhancing participants’ knowledge (Tracy 2020). In addition, scholars have advocated for the expansion of research-teacher collaboration to bridge the gap between research and practice and to jointly develop translanguaging pedagogy (Sato 2023; Shepard-Carey and Tian 2023; Tian and Lau 2022). This is particularly relevant in this context, where Ms. Zhou had not received any formal training in translanguaging, thus making teacherresearcher collaboration an important aspect of her translanguaging practices. Together, Ms. Zhou and I co-designed lessons and assessments that followed the principles and stages outlined in the translanguaging design cycle (García, Johnson, and Seltzer 2017) as a guide throughout the unit. This study focused on the co-designed formative assessments, illustrating how Ms. Zhou implemented them in her CLIL classroom. Additionally, I reported the perspectives of both Ms. Zhou and her students on these formative assessments to gain valuable insights into their experiences. This was aimed at understanding their views on how the assessments contribute to enhancing students’ multilingualism and their learning of content.

# Context

The school adopted the International Baccalaureate (IB) curriculum and an immersion approach, catering to students from 18 months old to 8th grade. The immersion approach served the dual purpose of teaching academic content while concurrently developing students’ Chinese language proficiency, meaning academic subjects were taught through the medium of the Chinese language. The student body was diverse, representing multiple cultural and linguistic backgrounds. The curriculum featured a Chinese Unit of Inquiry (UOI) built around several themes throughout the academic year. Students were also prompted to explore these themes through independent research. Even though the school had a strict language separation policy on paper, Ms., Zhou and the academic director appeared to be open-minded, allowing Ms. Zhou to enrich her teaching repertories by collaborating with me. Hence, she had a degree of flexibility in adopting the translanguaging pedagogy.

At the time of this study, Ms. Zhou was initiating a five-week unit on ‘Advertisements,’ drawing from the school’s curriculum guide to establish two learning goals: (1) understanding the four key principles of advertisements, and (2) creating a commercial based on these principles.

In this G5 classroom, there were seven students who spoke English as their dominant language. Of these seven students, two students each spoke Cantonese, Spanish, and Mandarin at home, while one came from an English-speaking family. According to Ms. Zhou, the students’ Chinese proficiency ranged from intermediate-mid to advanced-low, as per the standards provided by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages proficiency guidelines (ACTFL 2012).

# Participants

The participants in this study included Ms. Zhou, who was the Chinese UOI teacher for G5, and five of her students due to the number of parental consents received. As a native Mandarin speaker, Ms. Zhou is also proficient in English and Russian. She received her education in China and Russia, and earned a graduate degree in the U.S. None of the degrees were related to teaching. At the time of the study, Ms. Zhou had three years of teaching experience, all of which were at Stars Academy. Before this study, Ms. Zhou had attended a 45-minute professional development (PD) session on translanguaging pedagogy with her colleagues and also participated in a 4-week translanguaging project that I co-led. From the PD and project, Ms. Zhou developed an initial understanding of what translanguaging was and found the pedagogical concept resonated with her teaching beliefs. Subsequently, she reached out to me, expressing her desire to delve deeper into learning more about the translanguaging practices. Regarding the student participants, I referred to them as Amy, Carol, Elaine, Josh, and Zion throughout the study. Table 1 presents the information about each of these students.

# Data collection

During the five-week study period, Ms. Zhou and I held weekly co-planning sessions, each lasting approximately 45 min. These co-planning sessions were audio recorded and transcribed. In addition to these sessions, our communication included email exchanges, text messages, and casual hallway conversations, all of which I documented in detail. Ms. Zhou also added me onto the G5 learning management system, granting me access to all the teaching and students’ artifacts. While I conducted in-person classroom observations two to three times a week throughout the unit, Ms. Zhou video-recorded each classroom interaction as part of my observation. I took detailed notes with thick and rich descriptions (Rossman and Rallis 2003) during these observations. Towards the conclusion of the unit, I conducted a one-on-one interview with Ms. Zhou, exploring her thoughts and experiences regarding our collaboration, her implementation of the pedagogy, and classroom assessments. This interview was conducted in both English and Chinese and lasted approximately an hour. It was, then, transcribed and translated into English. Additionally, I conducted a one-on-one interview with each of the five students to gain insight into their learning experience during the unit. Each of these student interviews was conducted in English and lasted around $1 5 { - } 2 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ .

Hence, the data were triangulated, comprising (1) transcripts and notes from the co-planning sessions, (2) classroom observation and other communications with Ms. Zhou, (3) teaching and students’ artifacts, and (4) transcripts of teacher and student interviews.

# Data analysis

Using the abductive approach (Charmaz 2014), I conducted a content analysis across two rounds. A concurrent data collection and analysis strategy (Quintanilha 2021) was adopted in the first round, allowing for the analysis of co-planning and observation notes alongside weekly artifacts to ensure confirmability. Open coding and memo writing (Saldaña 2016) were the primary methods, documenting my observations on the assessments, Ms. Zhou’s implementation, and student work. These memos also enhanced the dependability of the analysis. Examples of initial codes for RQ1 and RQ2 included ‘students’ knowledge,’ ‘higher-order thinking,’ ‘language flexibility,’ ‘motivation,’ and ‘peer collaboration.’ Additionally, I used in vivo coding (Saldaña 2016) to capture classroom dynamics, including interactions and thoughts from Ms. Zhou and the students.

For the second analysis round, I delved deeper into the data, centering on each formative assessment and its role within the design cycle. Constant comparisons were made among field notes, coplanning notes, artifacts, and interview transcripts, aiming for a comprehensive grasp of the assessments and the perspectives of all involved. Key quotes and detailed descriptions were incorporated to boost the transferability of the findings. After weaving together data insights, the design cycle, Ms. Zhou’s viewpoints, and student perceptions, I presented a summary of my interpretations to Ms. Zhou for member checking (Lincoln and Guba 1985), to ensure confirmability.

# Findings

Ms. Zhou and I utilized the translanguaging design cycle framework (García, Johnson, and Seltzer 2017) to design the instruction for this unit. It’s important to clarify that the stages of the design cycle were not regarded as formative assessments. Instead, within this framework, we designed formative assessments specifically to monitor students’ learning. These assessments, aimed at evaluating both content and language knowledge, also served to affirm their multilingualism. In designing these classroom assessments, we primarily adopted a performance-based evaluation approach. Throughout the unit, we conducted a total of four formative assessments that were embedded within the translanguaging design cycle framework. In implementing the assessments, Ms. Zhou seemed to leverage the gradual release of responsibility model (Pearson and Gallagher 1983). This involved gradually reducing guiding prompts to shift responsibility to the students. Ms. Zhou explained in the interview that she believed in the students’ capabilities and intended to foster their independent learning and active involvement in their own learning. Upon further analysis, it was apparent that the initial codes, such as language flexibility, students’ content knowledge, and higher-order thinking, were not limited to specific stages of the design cycle. They spanned across all stages, showing their significance in both planning and execution. Below, I detail how

Ms. Zhou integrated translanguaging in the formative assessments within the design cycle stages through three themes: (1) introducing concepts through assessment, (2) refining instruction and documenting students’ learning through assessments, and (3) affirming multilingualism in assessment.

# Introducing concepts through assessment

Prior to commencing the unit, Ms. Zhou and I collaborated to outline the unit goals and develop an initial assessment to be conducted during the exploration stage. This assessment was crafted to achieve multiple objectives: (1) build the students’ background knowledge about the unit, (2) generate their interest and broaden their perspectives in both languages, and (3) gather information about the students’ knowledge of advertisements (Co-planning, 1/20/23).

In this formative assessment, each student was asked to select a product of their choosing and find two commercials related to the product: one they enjoyed watching and another they did not, preferably from different countries to gain a diverse perspective. Based on our design, Ms. Zhou, then, provided the students two guiding questions in this assessment: ‘我为什么喜欢这个 广告?’ Why do I like this commercial? and ‘为什么它没有第一个广告那么有吸引力?’ Why is this not as attractive as the first one? (Artifacts). The students were encouraged to use their full linguistic repertoires to describe their reasons. Figure 1 displays a sample from a student’s response on why she enjoyed the commercial. The sample illustrates how she primarily used Chinese and resorted to English for words she was unfamiliar with in Chinese. From my observation, Ms. Zhou had the class watch each student’s selected commercials and went through their responses as a follow-up class activity. In the process, she skillfully pointed out the four principles of advertisements as a way to introduce the main idea of the unit (Fieldnote, 1/26/23).

# Refining instruction and documenting students’ learning through assessments

During the evaluation stage, Ms. Zhou engaged students with a variety of class activities to introduce the four principles of advertisement (Fieldnote, 1/30/23; 2/1/23). Following these activities, we carefully designed an assessment as a key component of this stage with two main objectives. First, to assess students’ understanding of the learning goal: describing the four principles of advertisements. Second, to stimulate their critical thinking by utilizing their entire linguistic repertoire (Co-planning, 2/3/23). Based on Ms. Zhou’s understanding of the students’ interest, she selected an authentic icecream advertisement poster featuring a well-known brand. She then formulated four specific questions that targeted the learning objectives. Additionally, she posed three higher-order thinking questions,

# F+i....

such as ‘广告上写了Doing good never tasted so great，是为了什么样的消费者’ Who are the targeted audience and 请你为这个广告设计一段广告词 please design a script for the advertisement, allowing the students to think creatively and put forth opinions. To assist the students in their writing task, I suggested that Ms. Zhou provide support by including a bilingual word bank (see Figure 2).

Upon analyzing the assessment data, Ms. Zhou realized that there was a need for her to focus on one specific principle: functions. In her words, ‘I think the students still don’t quite understand what advertising functions mean’ (Fieldnote, 2/8/23). Thus, in the following classes, she modified her instruction by including authentic advertisements, such as commercials for milk and smartphones, along with discussions (Fieldnote, 2/9/23), focusing on the students’ learning needs.

Following a sequence of class activities and discussions, Ms. Zhou and I co-designed the next formative assessment as a checkpoint to assess and document the students’ progress in terms of the learning objectives and critical thinking skills (Co-planning, 2/10/23). To better assess the students’ true knowledge, I suggested that Ms. Zhou write the questions in English to encourage them to respond in English. With the aim of broadening students’ understanding of the topic from diverse perspectives, we chose a multilingual education poster from China for this assessment. In contrast to the previous formative assessments, Ms. Zhou intentionally employed a gradual release of responsibility approach in this assessment, presenting questions without key words to challenge the students further. She said, ‘I intentionally didn’t provide a word bank because I know they are capable of answering the questions’ (Fieldnote, 2/15/23). Figure 3 displays samples of the students’ responses to the advertisement. Based on Ms. Zhou’s analysis of the students’ responses, she commented, ‘I found that the students are very creative; they all observed different things’ (Co-planning, 2/17/23).

# Affirming multilingualism in assessment

In the remaining stages – imagination, presentation, and implementation – Ms. Zhou and I incorporated the task of creating a multimodal commercial as an integral assessment activity to gauge students’ application of the learning objectives. Understanding the students had diverse language practices at home, Ms. Zhou suggested grouping them based on their heritage backgrounds. She stated, ‘Our class has students who speak different languages at home, including Spanish, Cantonese, and Mandarin. We can put them into small groups and have them design an advertisement using their heritage language’ (Co-planning, 2/17/23).

Samples of students’ responses.

Thus, in this formative assessment, the students were tasked with choosing a product and creating an advertisement using their full linguistic repertoire, based on the four principles they had learned. At this stage of their learning, Ms. Zhou believed that the students would not need any prompts, encouraging them to brainstorm, research, and exercise their creativity (Co-Planning Notes, 2/17/23). Upon introducing and explaining the project to the students, three groups decided to produce a video, while Zion insisted on working alone and created a skit, inviting the whole class to participate in the play (Fieldnote, 2/23/23).

In addition, our intention was to create an opportunity for family involvement in this assessment, encouraging students to discuss their projects with their families and explore new language use in the heritage languages together. This formative assessment not only engaged students in family discussions and peer collaboration but also included revision and presentation of their work to family and peers for feedback. Furthermore, Ms. Zhou effectively utilized class time to establish a co-learning environment where students collaborated on this assessment. For instance, when a student encountered difficulties, she sought assistance from another group, saying, ‘Can you show me how to merge these two clips together?’ Similarly, when a student needed help with the Cantonese word for chocolate, her partner provided the translation, ‘I think it is ju-gu-lik’ (Fieldnote, 2/21).

Ms. Zhou also provided support and feedback for the students during the presentation stage, reminding them to keep the four principles in mind and assisting individual groups when questions arose. Throughout this process, it became evident that not only were the students able to showcase their multilingualism, but they actively participated in a collaborative and supportive environment, sharing ideas, editing the multimodal product, as well as receiving and providing feedback to one another (Fieldnote, 2/21-24/23).

After completing the multimodal commercial, it was time to present it to their peers, as part of the activity during the implementation stage. Despite her strong translanguaging stance, Ms. Zhou believed it was important for them to use Chinese in class as much as possible. She stated, ‘I still hope that they speak more Chinese at school.’ Therefore, she intended to have the students introduce the selected product in Chinese before showing the commercial and engage their peers with follow-up questions, offering an opportunity for the audience to provide feedback (Co-Planning, 2/17/23).

With this idea in mind, Ms. Zhou supplied the students with a graphic organizer on the day of the presentation (see Figure 4) as a reference for the presentation format. The first three items focused on introducing the group, product, and the product’s logo. The fourth item involved showcasing the multimodal commercial, while the fifth item entailed posing follow-up questions to the audience. Lastly, the sixth item involved requesting feedback.

In the presentations, students not only met the objective but also displayed proficiency in Chinese. Despite using their heritage languages, they infused their commercials with creativity through music, graphics, and dance, and adeptly incorporated multiple languages for audience comprehension. For instance, one group delivered the commercial entirely in Chinese and provided English subtitles. One audience member asked, ‘你为什么有英文的 subtitle?’ Why did you have English subtitles? A group member responded, ‘因为我们想要让 international 的人看’ We want to let international people watch it. (Class Observation Notes, 2/24/23). Figure 5 displays the students’ multilingual and multimodal assessment products, further illustrating their use of translanguaging. Ms. Zhou exclaimed that she was proud of her students, saying, ‘They are amazing! Their learning ability is really strong’ (Fieldnote, 2/24/23).

In the following section, I present the perspectives of Ms. Zhou and the students on these formative assessments.

# Teacher perspectives

From the teacher’s perspective, Ms. Zhou expressed her gratitude for the collaborative efforts between us on multiple occasions throughout the process. The experience not only expanded her knowledge of translanguaging, but also her overall instruction and classroom assessment for her future teaching endeavors. In her words, ‘Previously, I had knowledge of various teaching methods but lacked a systematic approach to planning and design. However, now I feel much more confident as I have a clear understanding of what needs to be done at each step’ (Interview). In addition, Ms. Zhou pointed out the elements that contributed to the successful collaboration: trust and honesty. She stated,

I was happy to work together because I know everyone has their own strengths and limits. Your expertise along with our shared background knowledge and cultural backgrounds, created a remarkable connection where you understood my concerns without me saying them. These contributed to the seamless and successful co-design process. I was also completely transparent with you about where I needed assistance, which is why I was highly receptive to your ideas and eager to implement them.

When reflecting on the assessments carried out, asking the students to demonstrate their knowledge by means of their full linguistic repertoire allowed Ms. Zhou to examine their content knowledge. She stated that all of the planned assessments provided true evidence of the students’ content knowledge, which informed instruction (Interview). In addition, she also observed that the assessments motivated the students to put in efforts and helped each other. She especially appreciated the formative assessment where the students used heritage languages to produce an advertisement. Not only was she amazed by the students’ capabilities, but she also observed that such an approach increased student confidence. In her words,

One student, who typically faces significant pressure due to their family background, seemed to find their breakthrough during this assessment. They were able to freely display themselves and experienced a boost in selfconfidence. Additionally, there were a few other students who were generally reserved. Despite their diligent efforts, they often felt their Chinese and Mathematics skills were inferior to others. Through this assessment, they developed a newfound self-confidence, which I clearly observed.

In addition, Ms. Zhou highlighted the significance of the assessment in which the students were asked to write their responses in English as it provided authentic evidence of the students’ content knowledge, which in turn informed her instructional approach. She specifically emphasized her intentional inclusion of the final question, ‘Read the poster again, share the information you obtained from the commercial, and write a short essay’ (Artifact). This question served multiple purposes – not only did it allow Ms. Zhou to gain diverse perspectives from the students, but it also served as preparation for their upcoming writing assignment. In her words, ‘asking them to elaborate on this assessment is a good skill that can help them with writing details. I’ll assign them to write another essay using this skill soon. I also think different perspectives led to different answers’ (Fieldnote, 2/14/23).

Nonetheless, there was a small moment when Ms. Zhou worried about the parents’ acceptance of using other languages in the school. She soon realized there was a trust between her and the parents and that she knew adopting translanguaging enabled her to understand how much the students have learned. She said in the interview,

Initially, I had concerns about receiving feedback from parents, but due to the trusting relationship I had established with the parents from the outset, I felt confident in allowing students to use other languages in their assessments.

In sum, Ms. Zhou discovered that incorporating translanguaging into formative assessments had numerous advantages, including enhancing her understanding of the students’ needs and strengths, boosting their confidence, developing their multilingual identities, and reinforcing their content and language knowledge.

# Student perspectives

The students interviewed all expressed their positive experience with the assessments and appreciation for the opportunities for peer collaboration. Zion specifically mentioned that this unit was the most exciting one due to the engaging projects they were able to undertake (Fieldnote, 3/17/23). When asked how they felt about being able to use different languages to demonstrate their knowledge, they said that it felt strange at first because they had never been asked to do so. However, they agreed that being able to use English enabled them to express their ideas further. For example, Elaine stated, ‘Sometimes I don’t know how to say new things in Chinese. [Ms. Zhou] lets us say it in English and she’ll tell us how to say it in Chinese, which helps me remember.’ Similarly, Carol explained, ‘If I can write down my points in English first, it would help me focus on Chinese later’ (Interview).

The students confirmed that integrating translanguaging into classroom assessments had a positive impact on their multilingual identities and confidence, while also creating valuable co-learning opportunities with their peers and families. In particular, the assessment that asked the students to use their heritage language allowed the students to appreciate the linguistic diversity spoken by their peers. When asked about their experiences with this project, their eyes lit up with excitement. They expressed initial surprise when Ms. Zhou first introduced the idea of using languages other than Chinese and English, but they thoroughly enjoyed the assessment and found it immensely rewarding. The following excerpts from two students provide such evidence. Josh said, ‘It was really cool … I like to speak Spanish and it was fun to work with a friend who speaks Spanish. This project also helped me understand how to design an advertisement.’ Similarly, Carol said,

At first, I didn’t want to do it because no one would understand. I was scared that I might not know everything in Cantonese. But then I found out that everyone is using a different language and my mom helped me with my Cantonese. I’m very happy that I could speak Cantonese in this 广告 (advertisement).

Despite not understanding the specific languages used by their peers, the students shared that their existing content knowledge of the unit and other communicative resources, such as symbols, visuals, and occasional subtitles, enabled them to comprehend the content of the advertisements. For example, Amy said, ‘I understood most of the content because there was other stuff to help me understand … It’s really cool to hear different languages and I learned how to say a few things in Spanish now.’

Overall, the students found the assessments enjoyable and rewarding. They appreciated the opportunities for peer collaboration, utilizing each other’s strengths and overcoming challenges together.

# Discussion

In this paper, I described how, through our collaboration, Ms. Zhou, incorporated translanguaging pedagogy into formative assessments within a Chinese immersion classroom by integrating the translanguaging design cycle. Additionally, I explored the perspectives of both Ms. Zhou and the students regarding these assessments, emphasizing their positive experiences and their engagement with content knowledge and multilingual abilities.

Integrating formative assessments throughout the design cycle enabled Ms. Zhou to systematically plan and adjust her instruction based on assessment data. She skillfully incorporated the gradual release model (Pearson and Gallagher 1983), which enhanced student motivation, confidence, and allowed diverse communicative repertoires. This approach achieved several goals: it facilitated instructional adjustments based on student strengths, provided ‘truthful learning evidence’ (Wang and East 2023, 19), expanded Chinese proficiency, and nurtured independent and collaborative skills. Thus, I recommend CLIL teachers combine the translanguaging design cycle with the gradual release model for assessments. This fosters systematic planning, data-driven instruction, and holistic student development while affirming their multilingualism.

From the teacher’s perspective, Ms. Zhou found the formative assessments valuable in gaining insights into students’ content knowledge and strengths. Her reflections not only underscore the value of collaborative partnerships between teachers and researchers in enhancing instructional practices, as demonstrated in Tian and Lau (2022), but also emphasize their capacity for improving assessment strategies. Furthermore, the trust and honesty between Ms. Zhou and I appeared to contribute to a successful co-design process. Such a collaboration facilitated the successful implementation of assessments that incorporated translanguaging pedagogy. Thus, while advocating for the expansion of research-teacher collaboration to bridge the gap between research and practice and enhance teaching practices (Sato 2023; Shepard-Carey and Tian 2023), I argue that it is equally crucial to highlight the importance of trust, honesty, and open-mindedness from both parties for a fruitful and successful collaboration.

The findings from this study underscore the positive impact of integrating translanguaging into formative assessments in CLIL contexts, as supported by several scholars (Daniel and Pacheco 2016; Shi 2023; Wang and East 2023). Students reported that these assessments encouraged them to fully utilize their linguistic abilities, including tapping into heritage languages. This allowed them to authentically showcase their knowledge, exhibit sensitivity to multilingualism, and demonstrate an understanding of linguistic diversity. Moreover, the assessments promoted enjoyable peer collaboration. As they worked together, students acknowledged each other’s unique strengths and developed a greater appreciation for the linguistic diversity within their classroom – a viewpoint supported in previous literature (Tai and Wong 2022; Wong 2024). Given these insights, when integrating translanguaging into classroom assessments, I recommend educators to thoughtfully and strategically foster peer collaboration. This will help cultivate a supportive and inclusive classroom environment where students can recognize and celebrate each other’s strengths and linguistic diversity. This holistic approach contributes to EMLs’ overall academic and personal development.

In sum, the findings of the study highlight the need for targeted teacher training programs that focus on translanguaging strategies and assessment. Ms. Zhou’s comments on lacking a systemic approach to her instruction and assessment before not only made her less confident in her overall teaching, but it hindered her ability to assess students’ true knowledge of content and Chinese. Thus, these programs should equip educators with practical techniques for effectively integrating translanguaging in their teaching practices and for conducting formative assessments that validate students’ language practices and lived experiences.

# Limitations

While the study provides valuable insights, there are several limitations to consider. Firstly, the findings are specific to the context of one Chinese immersion classroom and the practices of a particular CLIL teacher. The success of incorporating translanguaging pedagogy into assessments could have been influenced by various contextual factors (Cenoz and Gorter 2021, 2022), including the teacher’s background and experience, the proficiency levels of the students, and the level of support from the school and families, as well as the availability of resources. These factors may differ across different educational contexts, suggesting the need for further research to explore how translanguaging assessments are implemented and experienced in diverse settings. Second, the study did not extensively investigate the nature of the research-teacher collaboration as the relationships between researchers and teachers could vary in different contexts. Moreover, the study spanned only the duration of a single academic unit, may not be sufficient to fully understand the long-term effects of translanguaging practices on student learning outcomes. Longitudinal studies could provide a more comprehensive picture of how these practices influence learning over time. Finally, while the study described the formative assessments in detail, it did not provide much analysis of how well the students met the learning objectives. Therefore, future research should delve into the dynamics of researcher-teacher collaborations and analysis of students’ learning through translanguaging assessments.

# Conclusion

This paper provides valuable insights into the incorporation of translanguaging pedagogy into formative assessments in a Chinese immersion classroom. The practical recommendations made include increasing research-teacher collaborations, adopting the translanguaging design cycle with the gradual release model into assessments, and strategically create peer collaboration. These recommendations can inform educators and researchers interested in enhancing assessment practices, promoting linguistic diversity, and supporting students’ academic and personal growth in multilingual CLIL and immersion classrooms.
