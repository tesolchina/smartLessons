# Abstract

This paper reports a corpus investigation of the Methods sections of research-reporting articles in academic journals. In published pedagogic materials, Swales and Feak [Swales, J. M., & Feak, C. (1994). Academic writing for graduate students. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press; Swales, J. M., & Feak, C. (2000). English in today’s research world. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press.], while not offering a generic structure, discuss the tendencies for Methods sections reporting research in the social sciences to be slow (or extended), and those in the physical sciences, such as medicine and engineering, to be fast (or compressed) e the metaphors of speed or density relating to the degree of elaboration employed in describing and justifying the research design and process. The aim of this study is to examine the differences between fast and slow tendencies in Methods sections in terms of their internal, cognitive discourse organization. Two small corpora, each consisting of thirty Methods sections (one for each of the two groups of subjects), are analyzed in two ways. First the corpora are rater-analyzed for their use of the organizational features of a cognitive genre model for textual structures (see Bruce, I. J. (2005). Syllabus design for general EAP courses: a cognitive approach. Journal of English for Academic Purposes, 4(3), 239e256.) and secondly by the use of corpus software for linguistic features that characterize the model. The findings of the study suggest that ‘fast’ Methods sections that report research in the physical sciences generally employ a means-focused discourse structure, and ‘slow’ Methods sections in social science reports tend to employ a combination of chronological and non-sequential descriptive structures. The study concludes that learner writers may benefit from access to the types of general, procedural knowledge that these discoursal structures employ.

# 1. Introduction

First this article presents the social genre/cognitive genre approach to discourse classification of Bruce (2005). This is followed by a review of existing analyses of Methods sections of research articles, the review leading to a proposal that Methods sections may be examined in terms of their use of general rhetorical structures, operationalized here by cognitive genres. The survey analyses of two corpora of Methods sections (fast and slow) are then presented. Finally the findings of the study are then discussed in relation to the types of knowledge that it yields for teaching the writing of Methods sections and also in relation to the need for a dual approach to analyzing genres in academic discourse.

# 1.1. Social genres and cognitive genres

There is currently a multiplicity of approaches to the classification of discourse, which means that terminology, including the words genre and text-type themselves, is used in very different ways by different theorists and researchers. This is not simply a terminological problem, but rather arises out of disagreement about the very nature of the object of enquiry. For some, genre is largely a social phenomenon, seen as reflected in the conventionally recognized functions and conscious organizational structures of whole texts; for others, genre is a communicatively motivated, cognitive phenomenon e a phenomenon that is reflected only indirectly, if at all, in the social function and overall structure of texts. As a basis for analyzing Methods sections corpora, the study draws on a proposal for two types or levels of genre e social genre and cognitive genre (see Bruce, 2005).

Social genre refers to socially recognized constructs according to which whole texts (or conventionally recognized sections of texts, such as Methods sections in research articles) are classified in terms of their overall social purpose and function. Thus, for example, personal letters, editorials, novels and academic articles are examples of different social genres, which are created to fulfill different types of socially recognized and understood purpose. Purpose here is taken to mean the intention to consciously communicate a body of knowledge related to a certain context to a certain target audience. In fulfilling this type of purpose, social genres may draw upon knowledge relating to context, discipline-specific content, epistemology, writer stance and the related textual conventions employed in the selection and functionally-related staging of content e variously termed generic structure (Hasan, 1989) or moves and steps (Swales, 1990), all of which to some extent influence linguistic choices.

The term cognitive genre is used here to refer to the overall cognitive orientation and internal organization of a segment of writing that realizes a single, more general rhetorical purpose to represent one type of information within discourse. Examples of types of general rhetorical purpose relating to cognitive genres are: to recount sequenced events, to explain a process, to argue a point of view, each of which will employ a different cognitive genre. The rhetorical purpose will influence the local discoursal organization of the text, relations between propositions and linguistic choices related to cohesion and coherence. A particular example of a social genre (e.g., a personal letter) may draw upon a range of different cognitive genres in relation to the rhetorical purposes that characterize the different sections of the overall message as it unfolds (e.g., presenting an argument; providing an explanation, recounting a series of events).

# 1.2. Review of genre analyses of Methods sections

Existing research that has examined research-reporting texts has largely been carried out within the English for Specific Purposes (hereafter ESP) approach to textual analysis. One approach by ESP researchers has been to characterize certain categories of texts as social genres by investigating their operation within a context in terms of ‘‘sets of communicative purposes’’ (Askehave & Swales, 2001, p. 210). To date, ESP genre analysis has focused on a range of (social) genres from academic and professional domains, sometimes confining their analysis to one or more sections of texts belonging to these genres (such as the Introductions of research articles). The organizational structuring proposed is in terms of the staging of content (content schemata), identified in terms of moves and steps. Dudley-Evans (1994) suggests that ‘‘decisions about the classification of the moves are made on the basis of linguistic evidence, comprehension of the text and understanding of the expectations that both the general academic community and the particular discourse community have of the text’’ (p. 226). The moves and steps structures are then related to linguistic features that are commonly employed in their realization.

Within the ESP approach to genre, Methods sections of research reports have been described in some way by Bloor (1998), Brett (1994), Nwogu (1991) and Swales (1990), but to date only Lim (2006) appears to have attempted to provide a detailed move-and-step analysis linked to linguistic features, following the ESP approach to genre. Also, Swales and Feak (1994, 2000) also offer pedagogic advice to learner writers on the characteristics of types of Methods sections.

Swales (1990) does not provide an analysis of the content schemata of Methods section of research articles in terms of moves and steps. However, in reviewing the findings of investigations by sociologists (Gilbert & Mulkay, 1984; Myers, 1985) and linguists (Bruce, 1983; Weissberg, 1984), he notes general disciplinary differences between Methods sections in research reports in the physical sciences and those in social science or interdisciplinary fields, such as Applied Linguistics. In the former category, Methods sections showed a highly elliptical reporting where coherence is achieved by a shared knowledge of investigative procedures and their likely sequence. Coherence is achieved by a ‘‘cognitive but not discoursal development of the initial nominal group’’ (Swales, 1990, p. 168). On the other hand he notes that Methods sections in social science reports of research showed ‘‘careful step-by-step description massively supported by anaphoric reference and lexical repetition, producing the kind of explicitness that we associate with standard academic description’’ (p. 169).

In published pedagogical materials, Swales and Feak (1994, p. 166, 2000, p. 206) characterize this broad difference between the two types of Methods sections in terms of speed or density. They say that in the case of social sciences (research areas that involve human subjects and human behavior), the Methods sections are slow or extended, and that in the case of the physical sciences (computer science, engineering and medicine), the Methods sections are fast or condensed. Slowness in research related to human subjects relates to the level of explanation that occurs within the Methods sections reporting this type of research. Bloor’s (1998) small genre study confirms higher frequencies of examples, justifications and details in slow Methods sections.

While not specifically exploring the fast/slow distinction, Lim (2006) examined the Methods sections in 20 articles from two business management journals and proposed a schematic structure for the organization of their content in terms of three ‘moves’ and twelve ‘steps’ e some of the steps being further specified in terms of two or three sub-steps. His move-and-step analysis is summarized in Table 1.

Each of the steps is, in turn described, in terms of linguistic features that Lim sees as salient. (Because of the amount of linguistic information involved, these features are not included in Table 1.)

Thus, following the ESP approach to genre, Lim presents a meticulous investigation of his sample of 20 Methods sections with an extensive focus on the linguistic features that relate to the moves and steps that he identifies. However, two issues arise in respect of the ESP approach to textual analysis, such as that exemplified by Lim’s investigation:

- the degree of specificity allowable in establishing content schemata for Methods sections, such as in terms of a move, step analysis; and,   
- the pedagogical usefulness of linking features of the content schemata (moves and steps) to linguistic features for developing a writer’s capacity (see Widdowson, 1983, p. 7).

In relation to the staging and organization of the content of Methods sections of his sample, Lim provides data indicating the actual occurrences of the ‘steps’ in the 20 articles for the sample (p. 7), but does not provide the same data about the higher level ‘moves.’ From the data provided, it seems that the ‘steps’ proposed occur on average in $65 \%$ of the sample and only three of the twelve steps occur in all 20 articles. This finding confirms the difficulty of establishing specific content schema patterns even in relatively conventionalized genres, such as research-reporting articles. This difficulty has been demonstrated by Paltridge (1993, 1997), who examined twelve introductions to research reports related to an environmental issue, attempting to establish a ‘generic structure potential,’ such as that proposed by Hasan (1989). Lim does not provide data about the occurrences of the higher level ‘moves’ in his sample although this may have been more pedagogically useful (in terms of generalizability to future situations of use).

Table 1 Lim’s (2006) move-and-step analysis of Methods sections of business management articles   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Move 1: Describing the data collection procedure/s</td><td>Step 1: Describing the sample (a) Describing the location of the sample (b) Describing the size of the sample/population (c) Describing the characteristics of the sample Step 2: Recounting the steps in the data collection Step 3 Justifying the data collection procedures (a) Highlighting advantages of using the sample</td></tr><tr><td>Move 2: Delineating procedure/s for measuring variables</td><td>Step 1: Presenting an overview of the design Step 2: Explaining the method/s of measuring variables (a) Specifying items in questionnaires/data bases (b) Defining variables (c) Describing methods of measuring variables Step 3: Justifying method/s of measuring variables (a) Citing previous research methods</td></tr><tr><td>Move 3: Elucidating data analysis procedure/s</td><td>(b) Highlighting acceptability of the methods Step 1: Relating data analysis procedures Step 2: Justifying the data analysis procedures Step 3: Previewing results</td></tr></table></body></html>

The second issue that arises in relation to this type of analysis concerns the types of information presented in relation to moves and steps. In the case of the detailed analysis by Lim, this involves the identification of linguistic features seen as salient in the analysis. Table 2 is a summary of information proposed for Move 1, Step 1 in Lim’s analysis.

This communicative aim of Move 1, Step 1 involves describing the sample, including its location, size and characteristics. In conjunction with this aim, lists of discrete linguistic items are provided; however, in this approach there is no focus on rhetorical discourse-organizing principles (as distinct from content-staging in moves and steps). For example, in Step 1 when describing the sample, this could involve considering the types of organizational knowledge used in discourse that presents non-sequential information.

Previous research appears to suggest that there is a problem in characterizing (social) genres (and their stages) in linguistic terms. For example, Biber (1989), on the basis of corpus research, claims (social) genres are ‘‘defined and distinguished on the basis of systematic, non-linguistic criteria’’ (p. 39). This view is also supported by Paltridge’s (1993, 1997) study, which indicates that even in a relatively formulaic part-genre, writers will select from a wide range of linguistic resources. Therefore, while content schemata (such as moves and steps) and the linguistic features to which they are linked may provide part of the picture in terms of an approach to the analysis of exemplars (such as in Lim’s study), it may also be the case that exemplars also need to be examined in terms of their use of more general discourse-organizing (procedural) knowledge, such as in relation to a single move or step or a schematic structure. The focus of the study reported here, therefore, is on the types of procedural knowledge (as operationalized by cognitive genres) that are employed in Methods sections.

# 1.3. Hypothesis

The tendencies for Methods sections reporting research in the social sciences to be characterized as slow (or extended), and those in the physical sciences, such as medicine and engineering, to be fast (or compressed) can be accounted for in their differential use of general discourse-organizing patterns, operationalizable as cognitive genres.

# 2. Methods

In order to investigate the use of cognitive genres in ‘fast’ methods sections from physical sciences research articles and ‘slow’ methods sections from the social sciences (Swales & Feak, 1994, p. 166, 2000, p. 206), two corpora of 30 Methods sections (one from each of the two subject categories) were created. To select the texts for the corpora, academics from one university and medical staff from one hospital (both institutions were in New Zealand) were asked to name the three or four journals in their field to which they most frequently refer, and Methods sections from articles published from the year 1999 were selected from the nominated journals. The criteria for the inclusion of a Methods section in the corpora was that the article from which it is drawn must report an actual research investigation and conform largely to the IMRD (Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion) structure in reporting the research. The two corpora were selected from the following subject areas (Table 3).

Table 2 Lim’s (2006) example of linguistic features   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Move 1</td><td>Step 1</td><td>Linguistic features</td></tr><tr><td>Describing the data collection procedure</td><td>Describing the sample (a) Describing the location of the sample. (b) Describing the size of the sample/population. (c) Describing the characteristics of the sample.</td><td>Locative adjuncts e.g., on the New York Stock Exchanges Temporal adjuncts e.g., at two time periods. Compositional verbs showing a relationship between an entity and its constituents or parts e.g., comprise, constitute, contain, include</td></tr></table></body></html>

Corpus A consists of 28,612 words (tokens) and Corpus B, 29,148 words (tokens). A bibliography of the articles from which the two corpora are drawn is provided in Appendix A.

The Methods sections forming the corpora were scanned into plain text files and analyzed in two ways: first, they were rater-analyzed by the writer in relation to their use of the features of a model for cognitive genres and secondly by developing a wordlist and performing concordance searches of frequently occurring cohesive devices using Oxford Wordsmith Tools 4.0 (Scott, 2004).

# 2.1. The cognitive genre model for general discourse structures

Bruce (2005) proposes a model for four cognitive genres that are based generally upon the characteristics of the four text types that Biber (1989), as a result of a corpus study, found to occur most frequently in academic prose. However, in terms of their internal organizational structure, the cognitive genres are conceptualized in terms of cognitive, organizational knowledge rather than linguistic features. Drawing upon cognitive science and categorization theory, cognitive genres (as units of discourse) are proposed as types of highly complex category. The conceptualization of the cognitive genre model is constrained by the following key concepts from categorization theory:

- schema theory (Oller, 1995, pp. 284e287), which proposes that human knowledge of categories (even complex categories, such as types of discourse), exists in terms of idealized examples, such as a prototype;   
- prototype effect (Rosch, 1978, pp. 40e41), which suggests that prototypes provide the basis for recognizing or creating examples of a particular category; and   
- hierarchy (Brown, 1965, pp. 318e319), which proposes that the internal organization of complex units of knowledge, (in this case units of discourse), are organized in a ‘top-down’ manner e higher level general, to lower level specific structures.

The four different cognitive genres of the model (see Table 4) are based on the idea that category formation and organization (such as a category of discourse) is in response to human intention (see Barsalou, 1983; Murphy & Medin, 1985). Thus, the intentionality giving rise to the four cognitive genre categories relate to general rhetorical aims to represent certain types of knowledge within discourse; (see the rhetorical focus for each of the four types in Table 4).

Furthermore, drawing on the idea of hierarchy, the cognitive genre model employs a ‘top-down’ structure of cognitive systems for classification. These are: gestalts for ideas organization, discourse patterns for textual organization and interpropositional relations to structure more specific discourse elements to achieve cohesion and coherence.

At the upper levels of the model, the rhetorical purpose will engage a high-order, gestalt patterns termed image schemata (see Johnson, 1987) in order to broadly structure the content knowledge to be represented within the particular segment of text that realizes the cognitive genre. This is based on the idea that gestalts provide a basis for structuring knowledge in the way proposed by Lakoff (1987, p. 283) in his spatialization of form hypothesis.

(Bruce, 2005, p. 14).

While gestalts (image schemata) refer to the general organization of concepts or ideas, in relation to the overall organization of the actual written text, they lead to the engagement of non-genre-specific discourse patterns (e.g., GeneraleParticular, ProblemeSolution), which have typical patterns of co-occurrence (Hoey, 1979, 1983, 1994, 2001).

The aim to communicate a particular rhetorical purpose will also influence selection from a specific set of lowerorder cognitive categories termed interpropositional relations (Crombie, 1985). These always have two parts in that they involve a relation between two propositions, e.g., Reason Result, Condition Consequence, Chronological Sequence. Because these organizing structures involve propositional knowledge, they have a direct effect on linguistic organization and linguistic selection related to achieving cohesion and coherence within discourse.

# 2.2. The rater analysis

The author, as rater, analyzed each of the 60 texts of the two corpora for the occurrence of stretches of discourse that conformed to features of the cognitive genres proposed in the model. Analyses of the three levels of knowledge (gestalt structure, discourse patterns and interpropositional relations) were hand-written on each script (see Appendix B for an example of part of an analyzed script). Because cognitive genres are proposed as prototypical structures or tendencies, writers’ individual use of the structure may vary from a close to a distant reflection of the model in terms of the degree of use of its features. This study did not attempt to grade the degree of conformity to the prototype in the analysis of the texts. The benchmark for classification used was where stretches of text appeared to conform mainly to the features of a particular cognitive genre, they were classified in terms of that category.

# 2.3. The corpus analysis

The purpose of the corpus analysis is to provide empirical data to compare with the findings of the rater analysis. Specifically the proposal for certain cognitive genre-characterizing interperpropositional relations is compared with the corpus findings. Using the software Oxford Wordsmith Tools 4.0 (Scott, 2004), a wordlist was generated for each corpus. From the most frequently items in the wordlists, cohesive devices (lexical and grammatical) were examined by concordance searches, including scrutiny of their contextual uses. The frequencies and particular uses of these cohesive devices are then compared with the interpropositional relation elements of the cognitive genres assigned by the rater analysis to each corpus.

# 3. Results

The rater analysis of the two corpora of Methods sections (in relation to the features of the cognitive genre model) found fairly consistent use of the Explanation cognitive genre in the fast (physical sciences) corpus and a combination of Recount and Report in the slow (social sciences) corpus. These findings are summarized in Table 5.

The number in parentheses shows number of occurrences of a cognitive genre within a Methods section. In some cases different cognitive genres are adjacent to each other (e.g., Corpus A, Text 4) or embedded within each other (e.g., Corpus B, Text 9)

# 3.1. Corpus A: physical sciences (fast) Methods sections

The rater analysis showed that the texts in Corpus A tend to use the Explanation cognitive genre of which the most frequently occurring interpropositional relations are Means Result and Means Purpose. These two relations are summarized in Table 6.

The rater analysis of interpropositional relations in Corpus A texts found that the relations Means-Result and Means-Purpose together accounted for $40 \%$ of the total number of relations identified in the sample. This was followed by the relations of Chronological Sequence with $30 \%$ and Amplification with $16 \%$ .

To investigate these findings, Corpus A was examined by the use of the corpus software Oxford Wordsmith Tools 4.0 (Scott, 2004). Specifically a wordlist was generated and the most frequently occurring function words were identified; Table 8 shows the first 20 items of the wordlist generated for Corpus A (Table 7).

Swales (1990) emphasizes the importance of nouns or nominal groups in Methods sections in the physical sciences. Concordance searches of frequently occurring prepositions (from the wordlist) showed the several combined with verbs or nouns (or heading some other phrasal structure) were the most frequent signalers of ‘means’ and ‘purpose’ in the corpus. Table 8 shows the most frequent ways in which Means was signaled in this sample.

Table 9 following shows ways in which purpose was signaled in this sample, along with their frequencies of occurrence.

# 3.2. Corpus B: social sciences (slow) Methods sections

The rater analysis showed that the Methods sections in Corpus B employed mainly Recount but also incorporated Report cognitive genres, Report sometimes being added to or embedded within Recount as the overall organizer of the text. In the case of Recount, the model proposes that the one of the more frequently occurring interpropositional relations will be Chronological Sequence, and in the case of Report, the model proposes that one of the main interpropositional relations will be Amplification. The overall rater analysis of all the interpropositional relations in Corpus

B texts found that Amplification was the most frequently occurring relation, comprising $24 \%$ of the total number of relations identified in the sample. This was followed by Chronological Sequence with $12 \%$ , Means-Purpose $10 \%$ and Means-Result $8 \%$ .

The most frequently occurring relations e Amplification and Chronological sequence e are explained in Table 10.

Table 11 is the first part of the wordlist showing the 20 most frequently occurring function words.

The wordlist showed a high frequency of ‘that.’ A concordance search of the 219 occurrences of ‘that’ (including scrutiny of their contexts) found a high incidence of the Amplification relation using ‘that.’ Of those identified in the concordance occurrences, 123 introduced relative clauses and 65 introduced object noun clauses and 51 occurrences belong to other word classes. So, clearly, these types of structure are important and should be included in any linguistic focus in relation to slow Methods sections.

The rater analysis of Corpus B for instances of Chronological sequence showed a wide variety of ways in which this relation was signaled. For example, signaling chronology through the use and staging of verbs proved to be a commonly used device. These related to approximately half of the number of instances of Chronological sequence that were identified in the rater analysis, for example, ‘‘At times, I posted prompts to all the participants for open discussion, and the different perspectives I received from this discussion led to further interaction’’ (Corpus B, Text 3). Other common signalers of chronology in the corpus were adverbial phrases and clauses, for example, ‘‘A month later’’ (Corpus B, Text 7) and noun groups, such as ‘‘a follow-up content analysis’’ (Corpus B, Text 10).

# 4. Discussion

The examination of two small corpora of Methods sections in this study suggests that Swales and Feak’s (1994, 2000) characterization of general disciplinary differences of fast (condensed) Methods sections found in physical sciences research reports and slow (extended) Methods sections in social sciences may be further accounted for by the different types of cognitive genres employed. In the physical sciences, Methods sections appear to use compact, means-focused structures (operationalized by the Explanation cognitive genre in this study), while in the social sciences Methods sections appear to employ chronology-focused structures elaborated by information-reporting structures (operationalized here by Recount and Report). However, because the samples used were small and multi-rater analysis of the cognitive genre patterns was not possible, the findings from the study can be only considered indicative. In the discussion that follows, possible implications of the findings will be discussed in relation to two areas:

1. pedagogical implications for those engaged in the teaching of the writing of Methods sections; and   
2. wider implications for conceptualizing genres.

In relation to pedagogy, it is suggested that genre knowledge is used in two areas of activity: to provide a heuristic for the analysis of further texts (of the same genre) and to assist writers to acquire the means to create their own texts within the same discipline.

The focus of this study has not been on the social genre elements of Methods sections, but rather the consequences of these influences in the structured textual outcomes that they produce. However, genre-based pedagogy that attempts to teach the writing of Methods sections should clearly include a focus on both the social and cognitive genre dimensions of discourse or, as Swales (1990) puts it, ‘‘what is sayable and how and when it is sayable’’ (p. 88). In relation to pedagogy, it is suggested here that when examining the Methods section of a particular discipline, it is salient to first examine the surrounding social genre influences in order to establish a grounded view of this part-genre. As proposed previously this may involve consideration of discipline-specific issues of context, content, epistemology, writer stance as well as addressivity and audience. This can then be followed by deconstructing and practising the cognitive genre elements of exemplar texts which, it is proposed, will assist in providing writers with tools to achieve finer grained analysis of the textual elements of Methods sections in particular disciplines as well as the procedural knowledge necessary to create their own.

Existing guidance for teaching Methods sections, such as the two Swales and Feak (1994, 2000) books, Bloor’s (1998) study and Swales’ (1990, 2004) ERP books, establish the slow/fast (condensed/extended) tendencies of Methods sections and provide information about linguistic and stylistic features of these two tendencies. However, the approach here sees that the two Methods sections tendencies could also be considered in terms of the differing cognitive genre resources employed. Possible insights from the cognitive genre analysis of Methods section that could be included in writing instruction are summarized in Table 12.

In relation to genre theory generally, this study attempts to present a further challenge to a unitary approach to operationalizing genre in terms of a generic structure (or a move-and-step structure) to account for the staging of content linked to discrete items of lexis, grammar and syntax. The unitary approach may relate to what Widdowson (1983) refers to developing learner writers’ competence (involving social rules and linguistic systems) rather than their capacity, which requires the development of procedural knowledge, such as those operationalized in this study by the cognitive genre model. Biber (1989), Paltridge (2002) and Pilegaard and Frandsen (1996) all propose that an adequate theory of discourse categorization involves a dual approach involving both socially constructed genre knowledge and more general, rhetorical knowledge. The social genre/cognitive genre approach employed here further advances their ideas in terms of operationalizing the different types of knowledge involved for pedagogical purposes. In the case of Methods sections examined in this study, it appears that understanding the cognitive genre resources employed in this part-genre is an important element of the procedural knowledge required to be able to analyze existing texts and create new examples of this part-genre.
