Critical-pragmatic EAP   
Source-attribution instruction   
Plagiarism   
Action research

Source-attribution instruction in the EAP curriculum is typically designed and presented in a pragmatic way because Pragmatic EAP is usually considered effective for EFL students learning a range of source-attribution norms to avoid plagiarism. However, students may still fail to adhere to referencing norms prevalent in Anglo-American academic practice in their actual L2 academic writing. In this three-year action research project, a critical-pragmatic approach was adopted for source-attribution instruction in an EAP writing curriculum, during which students learned source-attribution conventions needed for target situations. The instruction, at the same time, called for their critical engagement with these conventions through carefully-designed in-class activities. The effectiveness of this new EAP pedagogy was evaluated through students' sourceattribution performance in their source-based writing as well as their responses to each activity through a questionnaire. This study reveals that a positive result of critical-pragmatic EAP lies in how it gives students confidence toward thinking that academic conventions are not permanent and unyielding but are avenues to develop more effective expression and critical insight.

# 1. Introduction

Although nearly 30 years have passed since Santos proposed that [nowhere in ESL writing can .. pragmatism be bettr llustrated than in the work that has been done on writing in relation to English for academic purposes (Santos, 192, p.9), much of current AP instruction continues to follow a pragmatic approach. The pragmatism that Santos quote refers to is what Cherryholmes (1988) defined as "vulgar pragmatism", and i in contrast to \*critical pragmatism". Vulgar pragmatism" was characterized as "unreflective acceptance of explicit and implicit standards, conventions, rules and discourse-practices", whereas "criticl pragmatism embraces "a sense of crisis .. rought to our choices", accepting \*that our standards, beliefs, values, guiding texts, and discourse-practices themselves require evaluation and appraisal" (Cherryholmes, 1988, p. 151). The reason for this lack of substantive change in the EAP field is that EAP teachers who typicall have a language education background are generally dedicated to helping students develop academic communicative competence, but maybe les concerned about socio-political issues that need to be addressed (Canagarajah, 2002; Crooks & Lehner, 1998).

When employing Pragmatic EAP, EAP teachers will emphasize a set of dominant discourse norms while, ideally, their students accommodate their writing practice to those norms, having taken them as standards. Assumed advantages of the pragmatic approach for novice writers are said to be its utility in demystifying academic writing conventions, failitating beginners writing practices and eventually leading them to successful publication (Allison, 1996).

While existing rearch shows students generally make significant improvements in source-use skills with a pragmatic aproach to EAP writing (Storch, 2012; Wette, 2010), several legitimat criticisms have been leveled at this approach. These include fostering unquestioning acceptance of established conventions, intolerance toward alternative options, and lack of openness to the possible value of giving students leeway to negotiate on their own terms the literacy demands they face (Benesch, 2001a; Pennycoo, 199)

This present study was undertaken in a Beijing research-oriented university, where Academic Reading and Writing' is a compulsory credit-bearing EAP course for graduate students. The course was designed to asst students to develop their critical reading skills as well asource-based writing skil. Instruction on source-use followed a pragmatic aproach because it was supposed that students taught L source-use conventions would scessfull transfer what they had learnt about effcive source-use to future source-based writing. Instruction on source-use mainly included source attibution and source integration (paraphrase, summary, synthesis). Among the source-use skill taught, I chose to focus my action reearch on source attribution because a failure to properly attribute source authorship is grounds for students' immediate failure in the course.

# 1.1. Source attribution in academic writing

Research has shown that L2 (in addition to L1) students' problems with source atribution manifest themselves characteristically with two tendencies: using source ideas/language without crediting that source (Flowerdew & Li, 2007; Hyland, 2009; Li & Casanave, 2012; Neumann, Leu, & McDonough, 2019; Pecorari, 2003, 2006; Shi, 2004), and attributing source authorship to0 vaguely and sometimes only implicitly, e.g., by obliquely indicating an author but not directly stating the author's name (Bloch & Chi, 1995; Hyland, 2009; Neumann et al., 2019; Shi, 2004). A recent study at a Canadian university that focused on L2 writers' use of outside sources reported $2 7 \%$ of source-use instances in student writing lacked atribution, while source-use with only implicit attribution accounted for another $1 7 \%$ (Neumann et al., 2019).

A number of studies have also explored factors influencing L2 writrs attribution practices when failing to acknowledge the source author (the firs tendency mentioned above). Such studies identified factors more at textual and contextual levels (Chandrasoma, Thompson, & Pennycook, 2004; Flowerdew & Li, 2007; Shi, 2010; Starfield, 2002; Thompson, Morton, & Storch, 2013), factors more at the cultural level (Hayes & Introna, 2005; Pennycook, 1996; Shi, 2006; Sowden, 2005), or both (Bikowski & Gui, 2018; Currie, 1998). Reasons accounting for implict atribution (the second tendency mentioned above) were mainly observed from a contrastive rhetoric perspective touching upon sues such as L2 writers perception of authors as named individuals, their understanding of overt criticism and their sense of author-reader relationship (Bloch & Chi, 1995; Campbell, 1990; Scollon, 1995; Shi, 2004)

Although students often seem able to show that they understand atribution norms quickly enough and that they are capable of adopting them in assiged writing practiceafter dedcated classrom intervention, instancesf missed attribution sill can be found in the post-tests (McDonough, Crawford, & De Vleeschauwer, 2014; Author, Year). In McDonough et al's (2014) quasi-experimental study in a Canadian EAP context focusing on summary writing, $3 0 \%$ of L2 students made explicit references to the source text on the pre-test, and the number rose to about four-fifths on the post-test. Despite obvious progress, around $1 7 \%$ of students' summary writing on the post-test and $2 0 \%$ on the delayed post-test lacked needed source attribution. In an EAP context outside the English-dominant society, Author (Year found that, ater focused source-use instruction, correct atribution of source texts increased from $4 6 \%$ on the pre-test to only $6 8 \%$ on the post-test. Such results offer evidence that student writers in an EFL context, though being positively influenced by instructio, may still encounter difficulties understanding or applying (or both) the seemingly simple, yet essentiall abstract norms. As plagiarism should not be treated as arigidl right/wrong isue, scholars suggested writing instructors have students delve in greater depth into the complexit of authorship, compare the text borrowing practices in their own culture and Anglophone discourse, and investigate students' perceptions of how academic norms operate (Barks & Watt, 2001; Currie, 1998, Pennycook, 1996).

Since adopting only a highly regimented, pragmatic approach in source-atribution instruction appears unsuited to addressing plagiarism in an efective way, it is necessary o do more targeted, active in-class work on best practiesof source-atribution in EAP instruction.

# 1.2. Pedagogical innovation: Adopting critical-pragmatic EAP

As a response to the noted weaknesses of Pragmatic EAP, a movement has emerged in favour of a critical pragmatic aproach' to EAP pedagogy that call for the critical engagement and problematization of discourse norms in EAP instruction (Benesch, 2001b; Harwood & Hadley, 2004; Pennycook, 1994, 1997). Drawing on the work of Pennycook (1994, 1997), Benesch (2001b) described Critical-Pragmatic EAP as an approach that can simultaneously prepare students for meeting target-stuation demands and for chal. lenging those demands. Similarly, Harwood and Hadley (2004) framed Critical-Pragmatic EAP as an approach that gives students access to dominant discourse norms, and at the same time highlights students free will in accommodating or flouting dominant practices.

From the above conceptualizations of Critical-Pragmatic EAP, it is clear that employing a critical dimension to EAP depends on understanding how academic discourse practices become socially constructed rather than fixed in stone, making any norm open to question and frank neotiation (Ivanic, 198). Rather than treat leners as passive recipient f asupposed canon of discourse norms, a criticalpragmatic approach presupposes an active, agentive role for novice writers,seeing them as intellectuals capable of participating democratically as members of an academic community in their content area.

To involve critical praxis n an EAP curriculum, some researchers advocat for inviting student critique by problematizing discourse norms and practice, an approach that would allow more active, reflective reappraisal on common-sense grounds that serve as frames of knowledge-making (Pennycook, 1996, 2001). Turning specifically to the subject of source atribution, Pennycook (1996) points to how the proprietary notion of "authorship' has evolved, with the sugestion for encouraging EFL students to consider how they themselves may operat from fundamentall different assumptions regarding textual ownership, so as to beter estimate how academic norms operate and decide how to use or strategically flout them.

Although there are yet few available teaching guidelines to assist EAP instructors in integrating critical perspectives into their teaching (for exceptions, se Crooks, 2013; Janks, 2014), umber of teachers on their initiative have made efforts to link the exercise of the critical approach to classoom work (Benesch, 2001a, 2001b; Chun, 2009, 2016; Harwood & Hadley, 2004; Kohnke, 2019; Morgan, 2009a; Scotland, 2020; Swales, Barks, OSstermann, & Simpson, 2001). Benesch (2001a, 2001b), in her linked EAP courses at a U.S. college, engaged students in discussing real-world considerations bearing upon her EAP syllabus design, including topic choice, assignments, and allocation of class time. In an EAP course Harwood and Hadley (2004) offered at the postgraduate level, students could choose to follow or flout their discipline's established conventions on the use of personal pronouns and posssive adjectives, these uses being based on corpora. Drawing on an ethnographic EAP classroom study, Chun (2016) recounted how another EAP instructorevolved her aproach in addressing racialized discourse in an EAP textbook chapter. Through repeated questioning and engaged discussion with her students about racialized discourse, the instructor developed her students' literacy skill from simply reading the text towards allowing altenative narratives and framings. Teaching initiatives like these offer promising ways to engage students in active interrogation of academic norms and discourse practices.

While a few researcher attempted to incorporate a critical perspective when examining students uses of citations (e.g., Harwood & Petric, 2012), no researcher so far in EAP courses in an EFL setting has integrated a critical dimension to source-use instruction. Although Clark (1992) has labeled referencing conventions as one of the four areas closed to flouting, I wish to argue to the contrary, that there remains room to criticall discuss referencing conventions in order to assist students to develop good source-use skills

# 1.3. Research orientations

This three-year action research project aimed to investigate the application of critical-pragmatic pedagogy to students' sourcereferencing skills in an EAP unit. Two questions guiding ths study are (1) How do students perceive the use of critical-pragmatic pedagogy for source-attribution instruction? (2) Do instances of student plagiarism decrease as the source-attribution instruction involves more critical praxis in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2?

# 2. Methods

Through teaching graduate students in an academic reading and writing course for several years, I frequently pondered which teaching practice could best adress the kinds of recurring source-atribution problems that showed up in my students EAP course assignments and term papers. Informed by discussions of critical-pragmatic pedagogy in the literatre, I carried ut action reearch to investigate how this pedagogy would work. Action research is described as \*an inquiry conducted into a particular isue of current concern, usull undertaken by those directly involved with the aim of implementing a change in a specific situation" (Hitchcock & Hughes, 1989, p. 7). As an investigative paradigm, action reearch in educational fields is characterized as self-eflective, systematic and criticl (Buns, 2011, p.6) It is transformative because of is practical aims of delving into problematic isues and carrying out deliberate interventions for positive change in the teaching situation. As clasroom-based action research usuall takes off from a specific taching context, and involves systematic ollection and analysi of real-lifedata over time to see whether changes take place, the following subsections introduce the study's instructional context as well as ways to evaluate teaching/learning outcomes.

# 2.1. Instructional context

The students in the study were enrolled in a credit-bearing EAP reading and writing course for non-English majors. Taught by me (the researcher) with the collaboration of a teaching asstant, the course met for 100-min sessions once per week for 16 weeks. The course textbook, compiled by a team of actively teaching faculty members at the same universt, was designed and targeted at students of low-tointermediate level English proficiency. Of the textbook'stn chapters th firs fie focused on critical reading skills and source-based writing skills, which aligns with the teaching focus for this action research.

Each textbook chapter focuses on a specific skill commonly used in source-based writing. Chapters one to five cover, in order, paraphrasing, summarizing, synthesis, using sources to back up claims, and casting acritical view upon sources. The textbook does not present source aribution as aseparate matter but incorporates this skillas it covers the asics of paraphrase, summary, and ynthesis writing, whil stating how students should explicitly cite a source author. The textbook also inroduces common introductory phrases and structures on source atribution. While i introduce integral and non-integral approaches to source attribution, the textbook does not contain information on referencing format (e.g., APA, MLA).

# 2.2. Participants

At the beginning of each fall semester during the three-year study, incoming masters-level students completed an in-house placement test to asses their academic reading and writig abilities. Students who scored below 70 were required to take this EAP reading and writing course (those scoring above 70 were exempt). A total of 96 graduate science-major students participated in the study. All 68 males and 28 females, ages 21-26 $\mathbf { M } = 2 2 . 0 4$ $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 6 3 $ , enrolled in the three EAP reading and writing courses over three consecutive fll semesters were native Mandarin speakers with 14-19 years of formal English study. Prior to this study, all students had passed China's national standardized English CET-4 (College English Test Band 4), with an average score of 471 $\mathbf { S D } =$ 36.82; CET-4 total score is 710 with a passing grade of 425).

Each study cycle had a different class; there was no overlap in students between cycles. An equal number of students $[ \mathbf { n } = 3 2 ]$ ) were involved in each cycle. Students in the preliminary cycle, first cycle and second cycle are labeled s1-s32, s33-s64, S65-596 respectively. In the in-house placement test, the average score for students in the preliminary cycle, Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 was 43.19 (SD $= 6 . 8 7 )$ , 45.41 $\mathrm { \Delta } S _ { Ḋ } D = 5 . 8 4 Ḍ ,$ , and 44.84 $\mathrm { \Delta } S _ { Ḋ } D Ḍ = 6 . 5 1 _ { Ḋ }$ ) respectively. Among the three groups as regards students' initial reading and writing competence, there were no significant differences $\left( F \left( 2 , 9 3 \right) = 1 . 6 3 \right.$ $p > 0 . 0 5 $ .2

# 2.3. Evaluation

Shortly ater being instructed in the EAP unit on source attribution, students who had consented to participate in the study were administered a questionnaire, designed by the researcher, intended to elicit information on their perception of the usefulness of the teaching innovation they had experienced. The questionnaire asked them to indicate on a five-point Likert scale how much they liked each activity in the EAP unit ( ${ \bf \lbrack 0 = }$ not at all; $4 = { \mathrm { m o s t } }$ positive). Each student's written feedback also was solicited with three open questions: Which activities did you find most beneficial and why? Which activities did you find least beneficial and why? What were your GPS (gains, problems, suggestions) from this EAP unit?

To free students from feeling pressured to write favourable answers, they were asked to complete their questionnaire after clas, and to hand it in nexto the class monitor the following week It was also made cler in the questionnaire's instruction that students should complete the form anonymously and that their responses would be used only for research purposes.

The students were also assigned a source-based essay as homework after the introduction of the ull range of source-based writing skil. The writing assgnment, adopted fromWatanabe (2001), required students to write an argumentative essay based on five source texts provided (with a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 8.40 and Flesch Reading Ease Score of 59.70). The five source texts provided information on how five different scholars thought about time management. Some of the scholarly opinions were in conflict. As a part f their essa, students were directed to add their own opinions about time management while integrating allor some f the five source materials provided.

# 2.4. Analysis

To find out how much the students, in gneral, favoured each in-clas activity in different cycles, the mean score they had given for each activity was calculated using sPss (23.0). As the sample size was comparatively smal, the qualitative data in the questionnaire were analysed manuall, using Braun and Clarke's (2006) six steps for thematic analysis. Qualitative data gleaned from students answersto the questionnaire's open-ended questions shed more light on how in-clas activities work in a real teaching and learning context.

Students' actual performance on source atribution was analysed according to a pre-established coding scheme. First, my research asstant and I independently examined each sentence in students' essays in order to identify sentences containing source ideas/ languages requiring further coding. We agreed in $9 6 \%$ of the identified cases; disagreement was resolved in a follow-up discussion. A coding scheme was then developed to represent how students referenced the source texts. Each instance of source attrbution was coded by one of the three categories: A (explicit attibution); B (implicit attribution); C (no atribution) (For definitions of each category and examples, see Appendix 2).

Next, I met separately with another research asistant to llustrate the coding categories using examples from students' writing in previous years on the same assignment. We independently coded those identified sentences in the preliminary cycle, achieving $9 6 . 4 9 \%$ agreement (165 agreement/171 coding decisions). Discrepancies were resolved through discussion, and minor revisions were made accordingly by fine-tuning the coding category. We used the revised coding guidelines to independently code the source-based writings in each cycle. The percentage of intercoder agreement was $1 0 0 \%$

# 3. Action research in three cycles

Following the model set out in Burns's (2011) graphic map of a four-stage action reearch, a set order was fllowed for each of the project's thre istruction cycles: First a saliet problem in the soure-attriution instruction wselete. Scond, arogessive set of lesson plans facilitating students' development of source-attribution skills was organized. Third, how students learned

source-attribution skill through source-based writing assgnments and questionnaire was studied. Fourth, I reflected upon where the instruction needed improvement. Fig. 1 illustrates the study's three cycles (overview given in Appendix 1).

# 3.1. Preliminary cycle

In the preliminary cycle (2017 fallsemester) clasroom instruction of source atribution followed a pragmatic aproach. Genre analysis, explicit instruction on atribution conventions, and correction of defective examples were three of the major in-class ac. tivities, along with their pedagogical objectives.

$\gtrdot$ Genre analysis

Afer students read two texts on the same topic (viz. physical attractiveness), which are a news report from an online newspaper and a journal articl, they discussed how the two texts referenced outside sources diffrently. This activity was designed to engage students in recognizing that referencing is integral to the academic genre.

$\gtrdot$ Explicit instruction on attribution conventions

While completing a blank-flling exercise, students were introduced to two common source referencing styles. Students had to select and fil in the proper vocabulary from a provided list of refercing-relad terms g., author, yer of publication, subject) to complete sentences describing source-atribution norms. They could do so based on their observation of exemplar sentences using a cited source. The blank-fllig exercise was intended to familiarize students with academic norms of source attribution, including the more technical aspects.

$\gtrdot$ Correction of defective examples

To reinforce the necesst f referencing in academic writing, a variety of student examples f source atribution that had collected in her previous years' classes were provided for students consideration and correction. Students were asked to identify place in these texts (from former students) that lacked referencing.

When students were asked to evaluate the three i-clsroom activitie n order t addressthe frs reearch qestion, a quantitative analysis of the questionnaire results showed that the first two activities received relatively higher scores $_ { ( 3 . 5 6 / 4 }$ for genre analysis and $3 . 5 6 / 4$ for atrbution conventions) than the third one, example correction (3.47/4). For the first activity, a comparison of the two geres on the same topic, 13 out f the total 32 students believed they leaned \*clearly (\$29) and deply (\$26) about referencing as a defining characteristic for academic geres. As for the second activity intended to pass on knowledge on referencing, most students saw this activity as useful as it helped them learn academic's popular referencing systems (i.e, author-date system and numeric system). However, eight students marked this ctivity as their least favourite, noting they could not finsh the task on time due to their limited vocabulary (S16, S28, s32), or they dislike the blank-flling form (S1, s2, S19, S20, s30). As regards the third activit, example correctio, 18 students believed this activit helped them reflec n their writing. One student remarked, When I read ther students mistakes, I would think more about similar mistakes I make. This activity wil influence what I must do to avoid such mistakes' Apart from the positive appraial, a few students thought the time alltted for the activity was not enough (\$10, s18, 26) probably because they needed constant comparison between students' writing and the source texts.

Post-preliminary cycle analysis of student source-based writing assignments showed that $2 6 \%$ of source-use fell into the category of no attribution', where students used those ource ideas when the ideas aligned with their own opinion but did so without citing. The finding is surprisingly similar to that reported in Neumann et al.'s (2019) study where $2 7 \%$ of the instances of source use in students' essays under test onditio contained no citation. Brief conversations between teacher and students revealed that this assnment was the first time they had ever used source texts in 2 writing. When discussing with students their source attribution practice for specific cases during the return of their graded writings in the present class, students revealed their lack of understanding of source-use attribution which could lead to plagiarism. The findings from this cycle motivated me to proactively incorporate more open class room discussions regarding authorship and intellectual property.

# 3.2. Cycle 1

After the preliminary cycle based on pragmatic instruction, Cycle 1 (in the 2018 fallsemester) advanced three specific critical discussions concerning the concept of plagiarism'. These three activities were added to the course curriculum in the first cycle.

Fig. 2. Paintings by Sandro Botticelli and Anthony Browne.

$\gtrdot$ Discussion of plagiarism

Afer writing down their own definitions for what constitutes plagiarism, students were shown computer images of two paintings and asked to express their own opinion on whether the art work The Birthday Suit' created by Anthony Browne (1946-) had plagiarized Sandro Botticelli's (1445-1510) Italian Renaissance painting The Birth of Venus' (See Fig. 2).

After judging the two pieces of artwork according to a five-point Likert scale as to whether plagiarism was clearly shown, or not, students with ifferent answers were asked to give the reason for their opinion and defend it in open clas discussion. Then students were asked to consider these questions: 1. f you were Anthony Browne, would you believe you had plagiarized Botticel's art work?" 2. "If you were Sandro Botticell, would you believe your art work had been plagiarized by Anthony Browne?" I debating the reasons students gave for supporting their stance, students were drawn to deeper levels of evaluation involving aspects such as originality, creativit, imitation, humour and innovation. The lively clas discussion helped them investigate why people's judgment f plagiarism might vary as they stand on different perspectives.

$\gtrdot$ Questionnaire-based discussion

Hu and Lei's (2012) questionnaire on referencing knowledge, which contains seven scenarios with typical examples of textual plagiarism found in Anglo-American academia, was then used to promote critical thinking in the ensuing discussion. Students were asked to individuall complete the questionnaire to judge whether or not each of the seven had a significant instance of plagiarism. After group members compared answers, students were asked to consider how their L1 literary background had approached plagiarism.

$\gtrdot$ Case-based discussion

The case for discussion, from an articl in Bradley's (2011) book, detailed how a group of six Chinese biologists from Peking University committed plagiarism in their jointly published paper in a highly regarded journal. Although the Bradley article included how the journal editor reacted to the incident in a 1995 editorial, I intentionall lef the editors comment out. Instead, I asked each student to write a response as if they were the journal editor. As anticipated, the students' wide range of responses underlined their different conceptions and attitudes towards textual plagiarism.

Quantitative analysis of the questionnaire shows that, among these three added activities, the first one received the highest score (3.72/4) from students followed by the third added activit, case-based discussion (3.59), and then by the second added activity, questionnaire-based discussion (3.41). The blank-flling activity on pragmatic aspect f referencing, brought in from the preliminary cycle, received the lowest score (3.13). For the highest scoring activity, students clld it very interesting (14 students or very impressive (8 students). Student ttributed their favourable score as being due to the approach to the awkward concet of plagiarism in a tangible, novel way (33, s36, 39, s46, 58, s62), for creating an engaging, open class atmosphere inviting participation (S41, s42, S46, s51), for promoting critical reasoning and stimulating good problem-solving discussion (S36, s41, s44, s45, s50, s51, 52, s58, S59), and for combining art work with teaching content perfectly (S38, s42, S45, s48, 51, S56, 59, s62). For the open. discussion activity amed at helping students mull over forms of textual borrowing, nine students believed a beter understanding of textual plagrism had ben clarified for them. With regard to the case-based discussion activity, the students liked the use of actual cases from student work, which allowed them to see an outcome of the real harm plagiarism can do to intellctual trust. Whil one. third of the students found very usful the intllectal value of the blank-filin activity retaned from the preliinary cycle, Cycle1's students also thought blank-filling activities were too boring (s3, s44, s46, s51), and assumed technical terms in the exercise hampered timely completion (S43, S44, S57, S59).

After Cycle 1 was completed, obvious progress was noted in students' writing in that more of them properly identified textual authorship when it clearly required referencing. Compared with the preliminary cycle, when only $6 8 \%$ of student texts used explicit attribution for source idea/language, the use of explicit reference increased to $7 9 \%$ in Cycle 1. Cases of implicit attribution increased a little from $6 \%$ in the preliminary cycle to $9 \%$ in Cycle 1.

When they made implicit atribution, students most often used generic words (professor, a scholar, a gentleman), collective nouns (some, some people, some scholars, people) for the source author (as shown in Examples 1 and 2 below), rather than the source author's name in adirect, explicit way. Students sometimes quoted the language from outside sources without ttributing, or indicated that the reported contents were from a survey or experiment without mentioning the person who conducted it for examples, see Appendix 2).

Example 1. A professor finds that the tiredness reaches a certain point, when it pases away gradually, we feel much fresher than before. (S39)

Example 2. However, there i a group of people who hold that the key to high performance i taking a good rest when feeling tired and to go to work in a relaxed way. (S45)

Informal text-based talk with several students revealed grounds for why they may neglect to explicitly refer to source authors names. These include reasons surfaced by previous studies including a belief that the readers (usually the teacher) have the same source at hand (Campbel, 1990; Hyland, 2009; Shi, 2004), reluctance to criticise directl (Bloch & Chi, 1995; Scollon, 1995) and privilege of collctive ownership (Scollon, 1995; Sowden, 2005). Additional reasons given by students in this study revealed that rhetorical transfer from L1 writing experience is likely to be a direct factor influencing students' source documentation. Students mentioned relying upon writing templates previously taught to them ("Some people argue ., others believe that .."). After an introductory sentence for an argumentative esay, similar to one used when he/she prepared for the universty entrance examination one student noted I think acknowledging authors by writing some people is enough. That was what we did in our high-school writing.

Such student remarks about their own attribution practice made me realize that how some of the students rferencing habits learned arlier (eg, vague attribution) were making their transition to 2 writing diffiul. It may be the case that, for L2 students who have grow up and wreducated in a more colletive environment, it is ntutively contrary to their ultural rflex Perhaps in a value system that more highly regards humility and collective credit, referring to a particular author by name triggers the cultural taboo of braggadocio, and the fall-back lies instead in choosing implicit means to signal authorship. For the post-Cycle 1 round of instruction, I decided that the teaching design should add more critical reflection for thinking through this aspect, leaving space for students to arbitrate 1-L2 coflicts on their own, and oncurrently consider whether student atribution f outide sources relatesto their sense of ultural identy, esial if they fee ompelledtring in ther venacular discorses t medat the wer of aadmi dicourses" (Canagarajah, 202, p.7).I assume students' heightened intercultural awareness would inform their decisions on when to follow, and when to consider flouting suggested L2 standard practices.

# 3.3. Cycle 2

For Cycle 2's source-atribution instruction (2019 fall semester), critical thinking was added to scrutinize confusing source. attribution practices from L1 and L2 expression. Three in-class activities were aded to the Cycle 2 curriculum, one each for selfcritical reflection, reading-based discussion, and oral debate.

$\gtrdot$ Self-critical reflection

Given writing samples that include a range of instances of explicit and implicit atribution, students were asked to distinguish between the two types and to theorize why implicit atribution was chosen in some situations. ince al the writing samples were from their pers source-based writing, this task was designed to promote self-critical awareness about ppropriate referencing decisions.

$\gtrdot$ Reading-based discussion

This activit, which linked to the first one in terms of critical relection, touched upon some historical perspectives on authorship atributio. Students read the 1979 article on a new drug for Malaria published in China Reconstructs and observed how Tu Youyou who contributed to the discovery was credited. In group discussions, they brainstormed possible reasons, including historical ones, for observed uses of implicit rather than explicit authorshipattribution. Student critique of such example raised awarenessof how their writing practice might be subtly afeced by cultural inluences from a Chinese heritage in which a collective mindset favouring group expression has a premium value. Following this historical perspective, I led students to reflect more deeply on current academic attribution norms. Questions included in the discussion were: \*who formulated the existing source-attribution norms?" And, "Should the norms be fulflled strictly or modified?" Student dialogue and discussion moved towards recognizing that aademic norms are not predetermined nor immutable, but in flux as social reality evolves.

$\gtrdot$ Oral debate

Following the reading-based group discussion, a student debate on the question Should important scientific prizes today be awarded to groups of researchers or only to individuals? focused attention on the trend of collaboration in scintific research. Discussion segued to how differing attribution choices are weighted in different cultures and in historical periods within a culture If students could gain insight that what is important is not conforming to a fixed model of thought expresson and presentation for its own sake, they might better shape their thinking about which reference norms of global expression would most likely reach the target audience. As they progress and mature, students need to see the value of developing confidence in themselve a cholars and have the willingnes to reflect whilestil being conversant with the knowledge structure of a chosen research domain. They must be encouraged to contribute to the continuing formation of norms in research communication to make new knowledge aces as inclusiveas possible for all researchers.

Considering the evaluation made of three added activities, quantitative analysis showed that students thought most highly of the oral debate activity (3.62/4). They held the opinion that fre' and 'open discussion' (S71, s82) about the controverial issue (88, s91) provided a deep or thorough percetion of the topic (S73, s77, s79, s80, s81, s87, s88, s91), especiall about competing value schemes in award-setting practices (S67, S68, S69, S94).

The students also reached a general consensus on the value of the self-critical reflection activity $_ { ( 3 . 5 6 / 4 }$ $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 5 0 $ ). They thought the sample writings that were examined helped them to see the variety of possible options fr source atribution (\$69, s71, s91, s94) and prompted them to consider within a framework of options their own thought proces for deciding source atribution and the relevance this hasto their personal history f literacy skill acquisition (67, 70, 572, 73, s80, s82, s85. As one student commented, It was a surprising moment to find to what degree our referencing preferences have to do with our early formative literacy practices (\$77). However, student opinion of the reading-based discussion activity showed more divergence (3.43/4, $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 7 6 $ . Students with a favourable opinion of the activity acknowledged how the step-by-step progres through the referencing practices was reinforced by connecting it t a larger sociohistorical framework (\$66, s67, S68, 69, 79, s81, s82, s83, s94). Other students believed that, though a thought progresson from phenomenal experience to reason-giving is a positive direction, ending discussion at the point of personal history is preferable to extending the discussion to a historical perspective (S70, s80, s88, s91).

As for the three activities retained in Cycle 2 from Cycle 1, Cycle 2's students in general also had a favourable opinion of the "discussion of plagiarism' activity (3.59/4) with 11 out of 32 $( 3 4 \% )$ marking this activity as their favourite. After giving those reasons similar to those in Cycle 1, one student (S69) aributed his/her positive evaluation to the activity's \*moderate difficulty, which encouraged his/her participation in discussion. The questionnaire-based activity on textual plagiarism in this cycle scored a little higher (3.53) than in Cycle 1 (3.41). In addition to comments similar to those given by students in Cycle 1, a few students (S76, s79, \$84, S96) in this cycle saw this activity as thought-provoking rather than as a yardstic for judging textual plagiarism. As regards the blank-fllin actity intendd to provide students with a f clear acdemi nors of referecing, Iliminatdthe blank-filling form based on student evaluation in prior cycles, and instead fostered inductive learning by providing students with normative source. atribution examples. This change greatly decreased task difficulty and, perhaps owing to that, Cycle 2's students gave a higher score to the activity (3.47 compared to 3.13 in Cycle 1).

Cycle 2 of source-attribution instruction continued the proactive, engaged approach, but with more focus on the types of dificulties students had to perform adequate source atriution due to different se f rhetorical traditions. Using the citical-pramatic ool-set, one said he/she experienced a great joy in leap-like moments of sudden, clear insight (S84), another found feeling of intellectual stimulation' (94) and a new reasoning power to hesitate long enough to deliberate on options, and to consider different, competing perspectives (86) generated in open group-sharing discussion. Seven students reported being positively encouraged by the lively and highly interactive classroom atmosphere (S84). As one student concluded, I have discovered personal confidence n source ariution in this very interesting and reassuring way' (S73).

Students in Cycle 2 showed notable progress with source atribution in their source-based writing, being clearly more conscientious about recognizing authorship of source texts. Of all student writing requiring attribution to source authors, $8 7 \%$ belonged to 'Student text gives explicit attribution to the source author' and $2 \%$ belonged to 'Student text gives implicit attribution to the source author'. Most of the remaining problems in source atribution belonged to boundary problems. Although students seemed to understand reasonably well that i should beevident \*at any given point, whose voice is 'speaking(Groom, 200, p. 15), they occasionall failed to refer to the source author who had bee referred to in the prior sentence. The same problem was also reported in Hyland's (2009) and Shi's (2010) studies. More pedagogical efforts would need to be used to address that in the next round.

Overall student evaluations of in-classroom actvities in the thre cyle and their source-atriution performance in the ater-class source-based writing are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2. Although one-way ANOVA shows no statistical difference as regards student evaluation of the activities in the three cycles $( F ( 2 , 9 3 ) = 0 . 3 3 , p > 0 . 0 5 )$ , results of the chi-square test of independence reveal a significant relationship between cycles and ways students chose to refer to source texts $( \chi ^ { 2 } = 2 5 . 8 7 7 , d f = 4 , p < 0 . 0 5 )$ in their sourcebased writing. This result indicates that different interventions do impact the way student writers referred to external sources.

# 3.4. Summary of the three cycles

This unit's critical dimensions stem from pedagogical attempts to move students to avoid a closed, unquestioning atitude towards academic conventions. This action research, asking students to reflect on their L literacy development and eek connections, past and present, was designed to help students comprehend that source-atribution practices are inextricably tied with notions of proprietorship and authorship. Furthermore, I tried to let them know the notions they have are situated in a larger sociocultural context. A greater understanding of the complexities is not meant to givestudents room to find excuse for violating norms, but hould alow them to recognize similritie and differences in the norms upon seeing familiar patterns; to realize how academic discourse norms, rather than existing in social vacuum, often reflect social presige; and to acept that norms stil in flux are open to change, divergence, reformation and critique.

Overall while I kept sight of the academic demands and target situations students must meet, the pragmatic dimensions involved effort towards students awareness of current academia's source-attribution norms. In this source-attribution EAP unit I encourage students to learn attribution norms themselves through careful observation of typical examples and through inductive thinking. Their familiarity with possible consequences of afalure to attribute was sharpened after reading authentic cases (i.e, biology professors accusation of plagiarism), through which they could lean which among the many tenets of sourceattribution are considered the red line. When students were asked to speak in the voice f an editor-in-chief, through the role play they gained a beter sense of what they would be expected to conform to as an author seeking their manuscript's acceptance.

# 4. Discussion

This classroom-based action research investigated how students responded to acritical-pragmatic approach in source-attribution instruction, and how they acknowledged source material in their source-based writing ater the instruction. Considering the context of cultural and rhetorical traditions, which through students' prior literacy apprenticeship may have affected their source-attribution practices, I suspected that a pragmatic approach imparting to students the dominant academic norms would likely be partly deficient. For this reason, I added critical dimensions in the frst and second cycles of the research to give students the opportunity to interrogate the typical source-atribution demands they fae during their tertiay study. As it turned out, students source-atribution performance in writing did not worsen when graduall les form-focused intruction was offered under pragmatic approach. On the contrary, a students engaged moreciticlly with source-attribution norms, they semed to beter rcognize the deeper complexit of source-attribution and to better accommodate themselves to the norms.

Although no significant difference was found with regard to the average evaluation score for activities in three cycles, students ranked highest the in-classource-attribution activities that involved dialogue, with pers and teacher. This finding supports the importance of students active engagement in the meaning-making proces concerning academic norms and obligations, a concept also highlighted by many advocates of critical approaches to EAP instruction (Chun, 2015; Harwood & Hadley, 2004). Students also expressed satisfaction with in-classactivities that required them to reflect upon their past L1 literacy practices so as to connect them with their current literacy requirement. This finding echoed Morgan in that students' L1 experiences can be \*valid problem-solving resources" (Morgan, 2009b, p. 89), and Chun in that EAP instruction should draw upon students' \*historically lived experiences) (2015:194).

Although various in-class activities prompting students' active engagement with academic source-atribution conventions were tried, I recognized in retrospect a few missed opportunities to move discussions deeper. When one student raised a question about future authorship after he discovered in Cycle2 from the reading material that writers did attribute the source author in a somewhat different way from current practices I could have led the discussion further. For example, I could have led the discussion on how notions of textual ownership might evolve in our changing technological and social world and in what way this could transform current source-atrbution practices. Future pedagogical practices could capture more about such "critical moments" (Pennycook, 2004) because it is not so much the discussion itself but a teacher's intervention that may be most effective (Benesch, 1999).

In this action research,comparisons had to be made among the three ifferent groups of students since there was a narrow band of time they were in graduate school. The three groups of participating students are comparable in terms of their 1 background, professionalization lel, academic feld, and intial reading & writing proficiency, as outlined in the methods section. However, factors such as students' personal trait, motivation, learning preferences, and prior literacy practices may have impacted the results to a certain extent.

Though I planned equal lengths of time in the interventions for the three cycles, I found it pedagogically challenging in practice since activities involving dialogue and discussion in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 were more time-consuming. More time invested in later cycles may account for students' greater development in source-attribution performance although the transformed pedagogy characterizes the major differences among cycles.

In addition to studying students' evaluation for the teaching unit and their actual atribution performance, it i very important to trace students development f citical awareness as the action reearch progreses. For example, whether there is a change of reason given for no attibution from students in the preliminary cycle and later cycles. While discourse-based interviews (Odell, Goswami, & Herrington, 1983) after each cycle seems, at firs, a promising way of collcting evidence in this respect, my pilot discourse-based interviews with students reveal that they were uncomfortable enunciating their attribution choices, perhaps because decision-making may partly involve unconscious thought. I thus dropped the discourse-based interview in this action research and, instead, sought evidence from their responses to the questionnaire's open-ended questions.

Although the students were not asked directly in the questionnaire about their opinions on forms of attribution, their responses to the questionnaire's open-ended questions may partilly reveal their opinions about various forms of atribution. For example, one student (S12) in the preliminary cycle noted, I like the third activity because I made very similar mistakes in the past. Now I think should avoid such mistakes. Citation is important when we refer to other's work." Another student (\$41) in Cycle 1 mentioned, What I gained from the clas is that no referencing is unaccetable in academia. We cant use language barrier as an excuse, as the biologists did in the case."

By coding the words accompanying "(no) atribution/citation/referencing' in students' responses, their opinions on forms of attribution were partially revealed. While roughly an equivalent number of students in each cycle (8 students in the preliminary cycle, 11 in Cycle 1 and 10 in Cycle 2) discussed the \*importance", "necessity" and \*usefulnes" ofatribution/citation/referencing, a change in students attitudes towards no attribution/citation/referencing" was shown. Whereas 20 out of 32 students in the preliminary cycle used derogatory words such as "disrespectful" (10 students), "unacceptable" (5 students), \*immoral" (3 students), \*intolerable (1 student), shameful (1 student) when referring tono attribution, only seven responses from students in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 carried similar value-laden words. Two students (S76, s81) in Cycle 2 even noted the necessty to distinguish inentional from unintentional plagiarism. As for implicit atribution, Cycle 2 brought a divergence among the students' views. Whereas 13 students showed disapproving atitudes towards this form noting, for example, that it was \*plagiarism in disguised form'" (S78), 10 students had reservations about the form. They belieed the use of implict atribution i acctable (5 student), and is dependent upon situations' (4 students or upon disciplines" (1 student). Another three students believed there i nothing wrong with implicit ttribution (\$66, 69, S71). Among them, one student said, "I may use this kind of referencing in the future" (S69).

Although preliminary qualitative data analysis suggests students more complex, intricate and multifaceted view towards source attriution as the action reearch progresses, we stilldo not know to what extent their seemingly more fine-grained thinking on source referencing impacts their actual decision-making procesince students completed the questionnaire anonymously. Although ano nymity free students from any pressure to write favourable answers, the anonymous responses probably prevented me from taking the investigation deeper.

Finally, conducting acritical needs analysis before adopting a new approach seems more necessary. Although students in general valued discussions pertinent to source-rferencing conventions, a few, smingly overwhelmed by the discussions, stated a preference for a hands-on activity in meting referencing requirements in a target situation. This response parallelsBarks and Watts observation that some students may be more receptive to directly, easil comprehended solutions since the discussion opens up the possbilit of \*complicating isues rather than simplifying them' (2001:254). Students' response reminds me that students are heterogeneous with different motivations for learning EAP (Helmer, 2013).

Despite the limitations outlined above, this three-year action research responds to an urgent need for critical-pragmatic EAP to focus on implementation, demonstrating how a critical-pragmatic approach can be employed in specific institutional sttings through welldesigned classroom activities. When weighing the question raised by Dudley-Evans and St. John (1998) of how far EAP practitioners should go in challenging academic discourse, assignments and practice, this study provided an example of how EAP practi. tioners can help students negotiate with dominant source-attribution norms. Although Pennycook warned, a critical aproach to ELT is in no way reducible to teaching technique, methods or approaches (199:341) I find the critical atitde he advocated tangible and able to be actualized through concrete activities in authentic EAP situations.

# 5. Conclusion

Through this three-year action research, I came to better understand how innovative pedagogy can help students approach dominant academic norms. The critical-pragmatic approach adopted in this study is neither a simple accommodation that yields to the circumscribed, nor a lasez-faire approach that encourages students to breach the norms with abandon. Students were developing the necessary skil sets for acadmic suces inluding the kind of advanced critical thinking that could adequately question whether some referencing conventions were unreasonable, inapplicable i certain situations, or poorly conceptualized. A uniquely positive result of this critical-pragmatic EAP training, I found, lay in giving my students he confidence to consider academic conventions as avenues for developing effective expression and critical insight, rather than as unbreakable shackles.

To conclude, this thre-year research concretized critical-pragmatic pedagogy by the implementation of a number of innovative inclassroom activities, most f them intellectuallystimulating from the students perspectie. At the micro EAP classrom level, opportunities exist for practitioners to draw upon students' social and L1 experiences as valid problem-posing resources, and even to encourage students to question academic norms. The critical-pragmatic approach targeting source atribution employed in this study can shed light on the teaching of other important literacy skills in the EAP curriculum, and EAP practitioners no doubt willdiscover additional diverse forms and methods to help students engage with dominant academic conventions.
