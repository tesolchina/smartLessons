Riding the waves of media technologies, academia is leveraging various multimedia platforms to publicize research and bolster public prestige, of which the Nature Podcast stands as a paragon of this paradigm shift. The auditory medium, produced by a world-leading scientific journal, allows researchers to disseminate findings in their own voices, popularize scientific knowledge, and enhance interactivity and immediacy with broad audiences. To investigate how this podcast democratizes science and persuades its heterogeneous listenership of research validity and novelty, this article analyses the rhetorical moves and stance and engagement markers of 40 episodes published from 2018 to 2023. The analysis identifies four moves and ten steps that are obligatory for podcasters to restructure and recontextualize scientific discourse for auditory delivery and public listenership. Further analysis reveals that, unlike the rigidity of academic publishing, "podcasting science" engenders a different scientist persona and a dynamic form of audience engagement. Arguing that the Nature Podcast represents a synergistic blend of technical accuracy and public accessibility, we demonstrate the dynamic interaction between podcast hosts and scientists and how their specific roles shape the interactions with audiences. Pedagogical implications of these findings are also discussed.

# 1. Introduction

In the rapidly evolving landscape of scientific progress and technological inovation, the need for science popularization has become increasingly important. Digital genres emerge as pivotal in this context by shaping public understanding, informing policy decisions, and enhancing scientific literacy. In response to this societal need, reearchers are flocking to various digital platforms to disseminate their findings, bolster their reputations, and transcend the confines of their specialized fields (Perez-Llantada, 2022; Tardy, 2023). This digital migration has blurred the traditional boundaries between scientis and the public (Belcher, 2023), elevated certain scientists to celebrity status in the "science stars" phenomenon (Travis, 2014), and fostered the innovative "scientist as journalist" model (Tcker et al., 2009). such, the apeal f aiin visbility in dtl meda i set to main ts uward rajectory, particularly driven by the "attention economy" (Hyland, 2023a) that characterizes the research landscape.

Amid the surge in digital science communication, the Nature Podcast has stood out as an increasingly influential medium for scientists to disseminate scientific insights and foster public understanding of research findings (Rowley-Jolivet & Carter-Thomas, 2019). Launched in 2005, this weekly audio broadcast features highlights from the latest issue of Nature, along with author in. terviews and expert discussions. Notably, the Nature Podcast holds substantial authority, as i is ffiliated with one of the most prestigious scientific journals. This afiliation lends a level of credibility to the content, making it atrusted source for scientific information. Despite debuting as a trial, it quickly gained prominence, ranking among iTunes' top 100 podcasts (Hanay, 2006). Now, having transitioned from a trial feature to a permanent fixture within Nature's suite of publications, this auditory platform has transformed traditional Nature papers into "enhanced publications" (Bardi & Manghi, 2014) that offr both authors and readers expanded opportunities to access, share, and disseminate knowledge.

What distinguishes this audio show of science is its capacity to humanize science, deviating from the formal, impersonal tone typical of research artices; instead, it embraces an audibly intimate narrative that vivifies abstract research concepts (Yuan et al., 2022. This is particularly evident when scientis dscus ther research with the presenter, and ofer a behind-the-scenes perspective on the activities that drie scinific progres. heir inider insights are often augmented by commentary and analysis not only from the Nature editors and journalists, but as from their scientific pers. These firsthand narratives, previously limited to academic stings like conferences or expert panels, are now democratized and made widely accessible to any interested members of the public via the podcast. As Quintana and Heathers (2021) note, the interviews with authors in science podcasts can reveal \*the kind of nuance that is not possible with conventional academic papers" (p. 1).

This intimacy in knowledge delivery is further enriched by the strategic integration of emotional resonance, voice dynamics, and topic-specific background music. These elements work together to create an immersive auditory experience that stimulates vivid mental imagery and captivates the audience (Wardaw, 2016). The inclusion of "show notes, which typically contain transcripts and links to research papers, also broadens the podcast's interactive potential and educational impact. As Hannay (2006) observed, the flexibilit and innovation of this digital format not only establish the Nature Podcast as a vital tool for researchers seeking to stay abreast of the latest scientific advancements, but also facilitate public engagement with, and understanding of, scientific inquiry n various on-the-go contexts.

Despite its ignificance in science communication, its great value as EAP resources (Liu, 2023), and the rise of digital mediation in ESP (Hafner et al., 2023), the Nature Podcast as a digitally mediated genre has received scant attention. This oversight is striking, considering the podcast's prestige and the overwhelming challenges scientists face in conveying complex information acessily within time constraints (Bardi & Meyers, 2015; Hayes & Grossman, 206). Though scientists have accessto much advice on engaging with journalist, such as avoiding jargon, maintaining a friendly demeanor, and using storytelling techniques (Dean, 2009), ths guidance seems practically vague and does not translate into actionable language skills This study seeks to remedy this gap by examining the organizational structure and interactional language of the Nature Podcast In doing so, we aim to show how scientis "talk" science to anon-specialist audience within the rhetorical confines f podcasts. We first investigate the rhetorical moves by which it is structure, and then examine the lexico-grammatical reources pocast interlocutors employ to expresstance and engage with the audience. Further, we compare the analyses with those of Research Article (RA) abstracts to understand genre uptake" (Bray, 2019), namely, how scientific claims and information are adapted, recontextualized and represented in the new digital context.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Science in the age of podcasts

The advent of digital technologies has precipitated a paradigm shift in science communication, challenging the traditional uni. directional model and fostering a more democratized, participatory approach. This shift has generated a diverse ecosystem of digital genres that both complement and disrupt conventional research dissemination channels (Luzon & Perez-Llantada, 2022). Emerging formats such as blogs, podcasts, TED talks, and Twitter harness digital media afordances-multimodalit, hyperlinking, and inter. activity-to expand public engagement with science and address diverse social needs (Luzon, 2017; Tardy, 2023; Xia, 2023a). Kelly and Millr (2016, p. 231) also term these \*parascientific genre, as they \*borrow scientific authority and knowledge structures from the realm of science but operates without the gatekeeping and traditional reporting forms of internal science communication."

Science podcasts, audio files available online, represent a key component of this digital landscape (Wardlaw, 2016; Ye, 2021) Unlike text-based formats or interactive wesite, podcasts can be consumed while multitaking, and this makes them suited to today's fast-paced lifestyles. However, this audio-centric format lacs the visual engagement of platforms like YouTube or the immediate interactivity of social media. This limitation necesstates that podcasts leverage their distinctive strengths in audio storytelling and in-depth discussions to convey complex scientific concept.In one of the first and most comprehensive studies on science podasts MacKenzie (2019) highlighted their capacity to reach diverse global audiences, with their proliferation marked by linear growth from 2004 to 2010, followed by exponential growth from 2010 to 2018. Their popularity has extended to prestigious scientifi journals, including Science, Nature, Lancet, and the New England Journal of Medicine, further solidifying podcasts as versatile tools for science communication (Clauson & Vidal, 2008). The adoption by these reputable sources has not only enhanced the credibility of the pod. casting medium but alo diversified the accessible yet authoritative content availabl to listeners Thus, this has enriched the daily routine and "science diet' of a vast audience.

The educational value of science podcasts has gained widespread recognition (Abdous et al., 2012; Bueno-Alastuey & Nemeth 2022). They provide a distinctive avenue for learners to engage with scholarly dialogue (Copeland & McGregor, 2021), understand research discussions (Cook, 2023), and enhance their learning experience (Heilesen, 2010). With their diverse formats including narrative storytelling, in-depth interviews, and panel discussions, science podcasts bolster learners' listening skill and prepare them for participation in interactive academic genres (Ye, 2021). Moreover, their use of discipline-specific terminology in authentic contexts, coupled with lower lexical demands compared to university lectures, makes them particularly suitable for EAP students (Liu, 2023).

The Nature Podcast pioners in democratizing science for a wide audience through an innovative format. Perez-Llantada (2021a) categorizes this podcast as an \*add-on genre, designed to complement and extend, rather than replace, the print and online versions of the journal. Garnering over half a million monthly listens (Natre, 2019), this platform exemplifes the interplay of core and peripheral genres in the digital sphere (Casper, 2016). By offring auditory narratives and interviews, it adds value and depth to the core gere of Nature papers, fostering an interconnected digital ecosystem and offering an auditory dimension to knowledge consumption.

It also ilustrates the concept of "context collapse" (Marwick & Boyd, 2011), where diverse audiences converge within one singular digital setting. Like Twitter (Tardy, 2023) it acts as both an \*inreach' tool facilitating iner-scientist dialogue, and an "outreach' mechanism targeting the public and policymakers. This convergence challenges traditional notions of "intended audience" and reshapes the genre-audience relationship. It also intensifies the need for efective recontextualization strategies, as content must be accessible to a broad audience while maintaining scientific integrity.

# 2.2. Recontextualization of scientific discourse for digital contexts

Science podcasts have emerged as an innovative medium for disseminating published research. This digital genre ofers a fresh approach to science communication, moving beyond traditional methods to repackage research findings in a more accessble way. The process underpinning this transformation is recontextualization, which Bondi et al. (2015, p. 2) define as a process by which some part of discourse is extracted from one communicative context and conveyed into another. This i not limited to textual changes, such as simplification, adition or elaboration (Calsamiglia & Van Dijk, 2004), but extends to creating new dynamics between communicators and their audience, achieving what Bezemer and Kress (2008) describe as "social repositioning.'

Studies have investigated the rhetorical structures and strategies in various digital genres to understand processes of recontex tualization. As digital and multimodal communication proliferates, genre theory (Swales, 1990) stil maintains its relevance and robustness Luzon and Perez-Llantada (2022, p. 5) argue that gere analysis is \*an appropriate and valuable" analytical model, crucial for understanding how knowledge is adapted in digital science communication. Applying this framework to specific genres, Ma and Jiang (2023) identified a five-move structure in graphical abstracts, including referencing visual, establishing reearch background, reporting and interpreting results, and highlighting implications. Similarly, news and views articles in Nature-branded research journals exhibited a blend of moves from reearch artices and review genres (Yin & Parkinson, 2021). These indings highlight ashit towards genre hybridity within scientificommunication. The rhetorical choices also reflect scintists' eforts to reshape scientific research to meet the demands of new contexts, audiences, and communicative purposes.

This discoursal uptake is also evident in the use of stance and engagement. When science knowledge is presented in digital formats, writers need to carefully choose language features to engage diverse and often unpredictable online audiences. comparative study by Zou and Hyland (2019) highlights this shift, demonstrating that science blogs employ significantly more interactive elements than traditional research articles. This trend towards a more personalized and evaluative discourse shows authors' conscious efforts to reconstruct their cademic personas and foster a sense of proximity with readers acharacteristic largely absent i traditional research articles. In 3 MT presentations, the immediacy of the spoken medium and the need to engage a live audience lead speakers to use many personalized features, especiall first and second-person pronouns (Qiu & Jiang, 2021). Multimodal affordances are also exploited to recontextualize the research article and increase its visibility, for example, Luzon (2023a) revealed that stance and engagement can also be expressed by the visual element, including stic images, emoji, hashtags. These adaptations signify more than mere stylistic changes. They show the adaptabilit of cientific discourse in the digital era and redefine the relationship between academic writers and their audiences.

Despite the extensive research on digital geres, the conversational and narratie tyle of podcasts, particularly the Nature Podast has been understudied. Rowley-Jolivet and Carter-Thomas (2019) represent a notable exception, having analyzed rhetorical moves and recontextualization strategies within this podcast. Their study applied uniform move categories across al genres for cross-genre comparisons. This method, while beneficial for comparative analysis, may not fully capture the rhetorical nuances of the Nature Podcast. Their focus on recontextualization techniques, including reformulation, repetition, and metaphor, does not suficienty address how scientists employ stance and engagement resources to achieve rhetorical goals in these time-constrained yet nuanced discussions. Similarly, while Ye (2021) examined rhetorical and linguistic strategies in Scientific American's 60-Second Science podcasts, this minute-long, journalis-led genre diffrsignificantly from the Natre Podcast, which often features in-depth scientific discussions between the host and the scientist. This lack of in-depth analysisis not unique to the Nature Podcast. Perez-Llantada (2021b) points out that, while the rhetorical and discursive aspects of digital genres have been widely researched, their specific linguistic features often remain overlooked. In this artice, therefore, we seek to reveal insights into the ways pecialist knowledge is recontextualized in the podcasting form and how the genre meets the social exigencies of science democratization.

# 3. Corpus and analysis

# 3.1. Corpus

For this study, we compiled two corpora: one comprising 40 transcripts of the Nature Podcast, spanning from 2018 to 2023, and the other including 40 RA abstracts associated with the podcasts. For the transcripts, we narrowed our selection to only include those segments where scientists were interviewed about their recent work published in Nature. Other recurring segments featuring only science news editors, such as "Research Highlights (concise research summaries) and News Chat" (science news coverage) were excluded, as our aim is o investgate how scientiss discuss and contextualize their work within a podcasting format. We rerieved the transcripts from the Nature journal's webpage (htt://www.nature.com/nature/podcast), verified their accuracy and made necessary adjustments based on the original audio recordings to amend any transcription errors.

The RA abstracts were collcted from the corresponding articles discussed in each of the 40 podcast episodes. Each episode's show notes provided a link to the relant articles, which faclitated this ollection process The choice to focus onRA astracts, rather than the research artces, stemmed fromther succinct summaries of reearch, thus providing a manageable corus size while til capturing the key research elements. Furthermore, abstracts and podcasts are both platorms for scientists to disseminate and promote their research, making them suitable for comparing rhetorical strategies and language adaptations. The corpora characteristics are described in Table 1 and Table 2 below.

# 3.2. Identification of rhetorical moves

We employed a top-down approach (Biber et al., 2007) to analyze the rhetorical structure of the Nature Podcast. Our initial coding scheme was informed by the moves identified by Rowley-Jolivet and Carter Thomas (2019) in their study of science podcasts. To refine this scheme, we conducted a pilot coding of 10 randomly elected transcripts. Through a series of collaborative meetings, we resolved coding disagreements, addressed ambiguous text segments, and iteratively refined our move definitions. This processrsulted in a finalized coding scheme with clear definitions and examples for each move and step, as detailed in Section 4.

To ensure reliability, two coders independently annotated an additional set of 10 transcripts using the finalized scheme. The intercoder reliabilit analysis yielded a Cohen's kappa of 0.87, indicating high agrement. Following this validation, the first author used MAxQDA, a qualitative data analysis software (VERBI, 2020), to code the remaining transcripts in the dataset.

# 3.3. Analysis of stance and engagement

To analyze stance and engagement in the Nature Podcast and the associated RA abstracts, we used the model developed by Qiu and Jiang (2021) for 3 MT presentations. Stance denotes the writer-centric atitdinal elements e.g, hedges, boosters attitude markers). Engagement refers to the reader-centric dimension, such as reader mention and directives. This model, an adaptation of Hyland's (2005) framework originally designed for written discoure is tailored to the nuance of spoken discourse, making it suitable for our podcast analysis. Their adaptation preserves the core elements of Hyland's model whil integrating modifications specific to spoken communication, such as the use of atitudinal adjectives (e.g., bad, \*good, "fascinating"). The resulting framework comprises approximately 500 potential markers of stance and engagement, specifically modified for analyzing spoken discourse.

To trace how scientists recontextualize their research, the podcast transcripts were divided into two sub-corpora by interlocutor role. This division enabled comparison of the host's and scientis's language use based on their distinct roles and objectives It also facilitated analysis of how the scientist adapts their communication style across genres and audiences when conveying specialized knowledge to non-experts.

The corpora were first part-of-speech tagged using TagAnt (Anthony, 2014) then searched for stance and engagement features using AntConc (Anthony, 2019). fter the searches, the concordance lines were manuall reviewed to ensure the markers were functioning to signal stance or engagement. Any irrelevant instances were excluded from further analysis. Both authors worked independently, achieving high inter-rater agreement (Cohen's kappa ${ > } 0 . 8$ ) before resolving any disagreements. To enable comparison across corpora, the results were normalized per 1o00 words. Statistical significance was tested using log-likelihood ratios (LL) with Rayson's spreadsheet.

# 4. Results and discussion

# 4.1. Rhetorical moves in the Nature Podcast

The five moves identified in the Nature Podcast, along with their constituent steps, are shown in Table 3. Importantly, the numerical designations for move types do not imply a linear sequence, reflecting the often-observed recursive nature of such moves.

Move 1: Establishing the topic, highlights research from the Nature journal, and sets the stage for the upcoming discussion. This move is realized by five steps, not all f which are utilized in every episode, owing to the diversity of topics. In this study, \*obligatory el. ements" are defined as those appearing in $8 0 \%$ or more of the sampled podcasts.

This move typically starts with an obligatory Step 1.1: Hooking the isteners, which serves as an attention-grabbing preamble that previews the central theme to be discussed. Utilizing this initil ste, presenters can fostr anticipation and suspense (Knobloch et al.,

Step 1.2: Providing context equips listeners with essential background information for comprehending the discussed topic. The host often employs scene-setig narrative or sorytelling techniques, a noted by Nesi and Alsop (2021), to ease cognitive load and aid in listener comprehension. For instance, the host utilizes a range of strategies to facilitate comprehension of scientific concepts. These include historical narraties, which recount significant events in science to contextualize the current discovery (3); references to familiar scenarios, which explain everyday experiences related to thescientific topic (4); and analogies, which draw parallel between complex scientific ideas and well-understood, simpler concepts (5).

# 3 Interviewer:

One day, 66 million years ago, a meteor around $1 0 ~ \mathrm { k m }$ wide hit the Earth ...the event that marked the end of the time of the dinosaurs and the start of what some call the age of mammals.

# 5 Interviewer:

And the connections, friendships and communities .. are something of great interest to social scientists and economists. In very broad terms, it's what they call social capital.

Step 1.3: Claiming centrality underscores the topic's importance, and seeks to convince listeners of its merit. This step can be viewed as a strategic response to the challenges posed by the \*attntion economy" (Hyland, 2023a). By using evaluative language indicating importance such as important, vital,saliet, as in (6) scientists position their research as inovative and worthy of listeners attention.

6 Interviewer:

Now, a team has developed porous water .. And they think that in the future, this method could have an important medical use.

Step 1.4: Establishing a niche identifie imitations in previous research, such as unresolved research problems, practical concerns or long-standing deates. This step justfies the releance and necesty of the reearch being disussed. It is typicall relized by the negative evaluation of previous studies (7), and negative forms like never, has not, a lack of (8). In our corpus, $8 8 \%$ of the podcasts include a gap statement. Thus, carving a niche i obligatory. This prevalent practice establishes research's significance and urgency, a vital step for distinguishing scientists' work in the competitive landscape of scientific publishing (Jiang & Hyland, 2017).

7 Interviewer:

But there is a drawback to this, as many of these studies have been done in 2D, looking at a rat scurrying over a flat surface.

8 Interviewer:

But exactly what was going on with fish during the Silurian has never quite been clear.

Move 2: Addressing the niche underlines how the featured paper flls research gap, builds on existing knowledge, and advances the field. This move provides a synopsis of the research purpose (Step 2.1), methodology (Step 2.2),results (Step 2.3), and implications (Step 2.4). Notably, Step 2.3, elucidating the major findings, is obligatory, as evidenced by it occurrence in 35 out of the 40 examined podcasts. Unlike research articles, the Nature Podcast typicallyforegrounds key insights early on. This aligns with Nwogu's (1991) observation that popular science writing often begins by framing contextual background for the research issue, and then follows this with the main research outcome. This early emphasis on key results is also seen in 60-Second Science (Ye, 2021). In this step, the problem-solution pattern is frequently utilized. This approach first identifies a specific problem and then follows with an explicit reference to a publication that addresses the identified isue, as indicated by phrases such as a paper in Nature has a new solution and new research published in Nature. Furthermore, the use of conjunctions such as but and however iscommon, serving to augment the persuasive appeal and intelligibility of the argument, as in (9) and (10).

Upon the interviewer setting the stage for the listener, Move 3: Describing the current reach unfolds the story of scientific discovery by recounting the research proces that yields novel insights. This esential element, found in all podcasts, constitutes the core of each episode. Commencing with Step 3.1: Introducing the scientist, the host introduces the researcher by specifying their name and pro fessional affiliation, as in (11).

# 11 Interviewer:

This is Laurits Skov, a researcher in bioinformatics and ancient genomes from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig.

The remaining seven steps of this Move all concern distinct aspects of the research, as indicated by their functional labels. These steps can be categorized into two broad groups. The first pertains to the core elements of the research process and includes the following steps:

Step 3.2: Outlining research goals is often accomplished through the host explicitly stating the purposes of the Nature publication being discussed, as in (12) Step 3.3: Explaining reearch methodology, establishes credibility by decribing the methods, techniques or tools used in the study, as in (13), where the host stated the innovative approach of constructing molecular cages; Step 3.4: Highlighting reearch chllenge, nartes the hurdes and complexties encountered throughout the reearch proces, a shown in (14), the scientist candidly discusses the paradoxical problem of oxygen deprivation despite abundanceof oxygen; Step 3.5: Discussing principal findings, emphasizes the significant discoveries made by the researchers, as in (15).

12 Interviewer:

13 Interviewer:

The way he and his team did this was by building a series of tiny molecular cages that were connected by even tinier windows.

14 Interviewee:

And one of the most frustrating aspect of oxygen deprivation is that we're surrounded by a ton of oxygen. But when the typical mechanisms for getting that oxygen into the body fail.. it becomes really hard to get that oxygen effectively into the body.

This much fastr diffusion allowed Cheng and hiscolleagues to separate the water from heay water, and in a way that's much mor. energy efficient than any previous methods.

The second group focuses on the broader impacts and implications of the research: Step 3.6: Presenting implications highlights the practical or theoretical significance of scientifi findings, as in (16), where potential applications for brain disorder modeling were discussed; Step 3.7: Acknowledging limitations enhances transparency by recognizing current challenges and noting potential weakneses f the research. This is exemplified in (17), where the scientist acknowledged the limited understanding of the human brain and related disorders; Step 3.8: Addressing ethical considerations, evaluates potential thical isues arising from the study, as in (18), where issues related to animal welfare and human donor consent were raised.

16 Interviewer:

Sergiu thinks this system could be used to more accurately model disorders affecting the brain ..

17 Interviewee:

I mean, the biology of the human brain istill a mystery to a large extent, and so is the biology of neuropsychiatric disorders.

18 Interviewer:

But of course, research like this raises a whole host of ethical questions concerning animal welfare, human donor consent. ..

Narrative strategies predominate in this phase, instrumental not only in rendering complex ideas intriguing and accessible, but also in humanizing scientis. Both the host and the scientist resort to a narrative story-driven format to delve into scientific topics. This storytelling of science, characterized by non-technical language, metaphors, analogies, and personal anecdotes, stimulates mental imagery in listeners and bridges the gap between technical knowledge and everyday experiences of the lay audience (Myers, 2003). As illustrate in (19), the scientist explained a concept by likening it to a familiar natural structure. Similarly, the descriptive visual language was used to create a vivid representation of chip layouts (20).

19 Interviewee:

A neuron could be activated in one location or a second location or a third location or a fourth location, and if you look at how are these locations arranged in space, it turns out that they form a hexagonal lattice, much like a honeycomb.

# 20 Interviewee:

Our physical designers, when they would first see these layouts, they're kind of these rounded, organic-looking, curved placements they thought there's no way that this is going to be high quality.

A notable feature in the Nature Podcast involves a segment where the host brings in an external expert to provide commentary, fulfilling a role akin to that of a peer reviewer. This initiates what we identify as Move 4: Engaging with peer insights. This move commences with Step 4.1: Introducing the peer expert, where the invited scholar's identity and professional background are articulated (21). In Step 4.2: Per evaluation of the research, the expert critically appraises the research being discussed, imbuing the discussion with further rigor and sophistication (22). Step 4.3: Suggesting future research directions, outlines potential avenues for future investigations (23). Prompted by the host's questions, Step 4.4: Author responses to comments allows the scientist to respond to the peer comments (24) This stratic inclusion of external expertise ads credibility and establishes scintific rigor. To illstrate how these steps interact, we extract examples from the same podcast as shown below.

21 Interviewer:

This is Randy Sur, nanopore reearcher and author of an expert-written article in Nature on the new paper. Randy is excited about the advantages of this work over older techniques ...

# 22. Interviewee: (Peer Expert)

I certainly think there is the potential here for a practical proces for obtaining heavy water. And one thing that's relly attractive is that their method works at room temperature.

23. Interviewee: (Peer Expert)

I doubt it. I think its a significant step, but scaling this up to some ort of industrial process willcertainly require additional work.

24 Interviewer:

Cheng agrees that more work is needed before this new paper can be used in industry, but he thinks its an achievable goal.

Interviewee:

We are confident that some more materials wl be developed with higher performance and lower costs, guided by our mechanism, to finally challenge the current industrial separation techniques.

Move 5: Conclusion and wrap-up is the concluding segment of the podcast. By restating the guest scientist's name (Step 5.1) and providing a call-to-action (Step 5.2), the host ensures smooth closure while encouraging further listener engagement (e.g., exploring the article, the Nature website, or related content), as in 25:

# 25 Interviewer:

That was Christian Metall from the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in the Us .For more on this sory, head over to the show notes for a link to the paper and an associated News and Views article.

Overall our analysis of the generic structure of the Nature Podcast shows that four moves and ten steps are obligatory. These structural regularitie illustrate that the podcast retains key communicative functions of traditional resarch articles while innovatively adapting them for a digital, public-facing context. This hybridity llows for a nuanced presentation of science that both informs and captivates listeners.

The presence of these obligatory moves and steps (se Table 3) demonstrates that the Nature Podcast typically begins by offering contextual information, identifying a reearch gap, and inroducing a recent Nate paper that adress te identified problem, before introducing the paper's lead author. An in-depth discussion then unfolds, with the host guiding the scientist to tel the "story behind the research, primarily unpacking the research challenges, indings, and implications. Through the host and author's collaborative efforts, these key elements effectively weave scientific research into an engaging narrative.

One key element missing in the obligatory moves, compared to research articles, is methodologies. While discussions of methodology do occur as steps in $7 3 \%$ of the podcasts, they typically eschew specifics or technical details (see example 13). This tendency, aligning with the observations of Luzon (2013) and Myers (1990), suggests that scientific popularization often simplifies methodologies or, in some cases, detaches findings from methodologies. This is expected within an auditory medium like podcasts, which often avoids alienating listeners with technical complexities. Consequentl, the focus shifs towards a narrative recounting of the research journey, and providing an insider's look at the reearch. This typically includes the challenges faced, personal reflections, motivations, and the broader implications and real-world applications of the research.

The strong emphasis on the behind-the-scenes narrative see examples 14 and 20) and the societal impact f research findings (see example 15) is indicative of a conscious move towards the humanization of science (Xia, 2023b) and the promotion of the research's proximity Hyland, 2010). Thi urther sugests that the Natre Podcast not just conveys scientifi fact, but also constructs an inclusive representation of science that transcends the lab's confines and the esoteric language typical of research articles. By illuminating unseen aspects of the scietific process and the real-world eet of reearch, these podasts effectively translate intricate scientific discourse into relatable and digestible contents. Like TED talks (Xia, 2023b), this transformation injects a humanistic perspective into the science communication, and debunks stereotypes of scientists as inaccessible or overly technical.

# 4.2. Analysis of stance and engagement features

# 4.2.1. Expressing stance

In the Nature Podcast, including both the Host and Scientist Transcripts, we identified 3634 instances of stance markers, averaging 61.3 per 100 words and 90.9 per episode. By comparison, the associated RA abstracts contained far fewer stance markers, with an average of 33.2 instances per 100 words and 6.8 instance er abstract. This discrepancy highlights the discursive efforts of both the host and the scietist to proect their personal perspectives and interpret the scientificlaims being discsse.These eforts are vital in the podcast format, where the immediate, informal, and dialogic nature of the podcasting discourse fosters a more interactive and affective stance-making practice (Biber, 2006). It is also found that the use of stance features corresponds with move and step prominence, primarily employed to highlight results, challenges, and implications.

Turning to the specific stance marker usage, we can see in Table 4 that self-mentions, boosters, and hedges are most frequent in scientists' transcriptions. In contrast, the hosts most commonly expres attitude, and the RA abstracts, which embody the factual brevity, contain the lowest frequency of stance marker acrossall categories. In the sections that fllow, we present these choices of stance-taking to shed light on the adaptation processes of scientific research.

Self-mentions are significantly more frequent in the transcriptions of cientists than in those of the hosts and in the RA abstracts the hosts corpus, $L L = 3 1 1 . 6$ $p < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ ; the RA abstracts, $L L = 9 1 . 5 2$ $p < 0 . 0 0 0 1 $ ). This strong authorial presence, typically realized by first-person pronouns, not only helps scientists establish a credible scholarly ethos (Hyland, 2001), but also adds a human touch to technical discussions. By referring to their research activities and perspectives, scientists typically inject personal authority and narrative into this publi-facing discourse, and frame reearch findings through anecdotal accounts of their own experiences (26 and 27). This contrasts with the more impersonal styl often adopted in RA abstracts, where the focus is typically on the research itself rather than the researchers.

26 Interviewee:

I think one of the coolest things is that we found two Neanderthals that were related to each other.

27 Interviewee:

It's what we expected to get and what we looked for, for more than two years .. now we need to recompute our bearings, so to speak, and rethink what we're looking for.

Podcasts accommodate diverse audiences, contrasting sharply with the specialized readership of research articles. This audience heterogeneity is evident in the heightened use of boosters by scientists, significantly more than in the RA abstracts $( L L = 7 4 . 1 1$ $p <$ 0.001) and by hosts $( L L = 2 8 . 3 6$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ . This preference for boosters aligns with the rhetorical shifts noted by Hyland (2010), where claims from research artices are frequently boosted' when popularized to accentuate research novelty and significance. In podcast, this rhetorical boosting, or \*upgrading as termed by Fahnestock (1986), aids scientists in emphasizing crucial findings 28 and 29), and establishes credibility with lay audiences (Fu & Hyland, 2014). This ensures that technical ideas are conveyed in an accessibl format to non-expert audiences who may not intinctively perceive the significance of research findings as scholarly peers would.

28 Interviewee:

Many zeolites are naturally occurring porous minerals. They're an extremely important commercial class of materials.

29 Interviewee:

Obviously, father-daughter pairs must have existed in Neanderthal history, but just seeing it makes them come much more alive, which I think is really, really cool.

While boosters convey assurance, hedges temper assertiveness or decisiveness. Once again, hedging remains significantly more prevalent in scientists' use during podcasts compared to their authored RA abstracts $( L L = 2 7 . 8 3$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ . The hedging actions project a measure of scholarly prudence, as they acknowledge the complexity and provisional nature of scientific inquiry. They frame nowledge as an evolving dialogue ubject to negotition, rather than as absolute facts. Specificall, scietists often exerise caution when stating their research findings and implications, as in (30) and (31).

Table 4 Frequency of stance markers in the corpora (per 1o00 words and $\%$

Within that grave, the individual, they were likely in their early 20s when they died.

31 Interviewee:

It does change in amount, so people seem to use less milk or more milk at one time to the other.

The use of hedging not only bolsters scientific rationality and intellectual humility, but also assumes a critical rolein cautioning against the overstatement or unwarranted generalization of research findings, which could misinform non-specialist audiences. This precautionary role isespecially crucial in fields with significant real-world implications, such as medical and environmental science. Considering the high stakes involved, it is crucial for researchers to exercise caution in communicating research findings in these disciplines.

However, the hosts convey their judgements and attitudes towards podcast discussions significantly more than both the scientists transcriptions and the RA abstracts (the scientists corpus, $L L = 1 1 . 0 9$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ; the RA abstracts, $L L = 3 6 . 1 3$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ . This prominence reflects the distinct role of hosts as evaluators and interpreter, rather than neutral presenters. By engaging in appraisal and contextualization of scientific claims, hosts act as facilitators for isteners. Specifically, they highlight what is intriguing or surprising, ffer critial perspectives, and maintain audience engagement (32 and 33. Such expression of atitude not only transforms knowledge dissemination into an engaging procesbut also enhances is accessility and emotional bonding with the lay audience. This echoes Di Scotto Carlo's (2015, p. 210-211) insights on the role of stance infostering rapport with audiences in the TED talks.

32 Interviewer:

And this is a surprisingly tricky chemistry problem, isnt it, just because of some fundamental characteristics of water itself.

# 33 Interviewer:

By measuring the dimming as it does so, he can get a sense of what the object is actuall like. And back in 2021, he saw something quite unexpected.

Furthermore, unlike the usual restraint observed in academic writing (Hyland, 2005), scientists express atitudes significantly more in podcasts than they do in the detached, fact-based RA abstracts $( L L = 1 6 . 0 2 , p < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ . This divergence may stem from the informal nature of podcas, which affords researchers greater ltitude to express emotions, assments, and personal reactions (34 and 35) The use of evaluative comments highlights scientiss' adaptability acros contexts and signifies a shift from formal to conversational style, potentially enhancing research persuasiveness, and newsworthiness (Calsamiglia, 2003).

34 Interviewee:

And unfortunately, we se places like the US and Europe are going to experience larger floods than they've adapted to in the past.

35 Interviewee:

We had a night crew and a day crew, and each crew would go for $^ { 1 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ , but in the end, it worked out remarkably well.

# 4.2.2. Expressing engagement

The analysis revealed a significant difference in the use of engagement features between the Nature Podcast and RA abstracts $\left( L L = \right.$ 115.05, $p < 0 . 0 0 0 1 $ ). Specifically, the Nature Podcast exhibited 21.9 instances per 1000 words or 32.3 per episode, contrasting sharply with only 6.4 per 1000 words or 1.32 per abstract in RA abstracts (Table 5). This undercores istinct rhetorical tategies between the genres, which may be indicative of divergent target audiences, communicative goals, and stylistic norms.

Table 5 Frequency of engagement features in the corpora (per 1o00 words).   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Scientist transcripts</td><td></td><td>Host transcripts</td><td></td><td>RA abstracts</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td> per 1000 words</td><td>%</td><td> per 1000 words</td><td>%</td><td>per 1000 words</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>Listener mentions</td><td>16.60</td><td>74.31</td><td>6.72</td><td>31.20</td><td>2.54</td><td>39.62</td></tr><tr><td>Directives</td><td>3.47</td><td>15.51</td><td>4.87</td><td>22.59</td><td>1.93</td><td>30.19</td></tr><tr><td>Questions</td><td>1.84</td><td>8.24</td><td>8.96</td><td>41.60</td><td>1.09</td><td>16.98</td></tr><tr><td>Shared knowledge</td><td>0.43</td><td>1.94</td><td>0.99</td><td>4.61</td><td>0.85</td><td>13.21</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>22.34</td><td>100</td><td>21.54</td><td>100</td><td>6.40</td><td>100</td></tr></table></body></html>

Listener mentions (e.g, inclusive we, you), which represent the most explicit forms of bringing listeners into a discourse by addressing them directly (Hyland, 2005), are significantly more prevalent in scientists' transcriptions than in RA abstracts $( L L =$ 136.59, $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ ) and hosts' transcriptions $( L L = 1 2 9 . 0 5 $ $\begin{array} { r } { p < 0 . 0 0 1 . } \end{array}$ . It is worth noting that, in host-scientist conversations, when a scientist uses you, it is aimed not specifically at the host but rather as a generalized form of adress This inclusive approach draws listeners into the discussion and includes them as part of the scientific inquiry, thereby fostering a sense of intimacy and proximity. As Myers and Lampropoulou (2012) argue, shifting to an impersonal you perspective allows scientists to present complex concepts as communally shared rather than idiosyncratic and invoke isteners presumed shared knowledge. This interpersonal bluntnes can be observed in (36) and (37).

36 Interviewee:

When you're dealing with ancient DNA, especially from very, very old, archaic hominins, like you're lucky to get anything a ll which is why this study is incredible.

# 37 Interviewee:

But those ssues of famine and disease exposure are fairly universal in human prehistory wherever you go.

Hosts, in contrast toscientis, employ this listenerriented device sigficantly les frequently in podcasts. Hosts primarily serve as conversation mediaors,seeking clarifiction and faciliting diogue. Ther use f you often addrses scietists directl  do you think this was asuces?), but in introductory or concluding sements, it may engage the audience by setting a context (e.g., You've probably noticed that electronics have ben shrinking) and sugesting actions (e.g., you can send an email to podcast@nature.com.).

Another feature which stands out in Table 5 is the use of questions by hosts. This is unsurprising considering the inherent inter. activity of podcasts and their established question-answer format. Through questioning (38 and 39), hosts transform what could otherwise be a dry scientific exposition into an interactive, co-constructed exchange. This dialogic transformation functions as a mediatory mechanism, actively addressing the knowledge asymmetry between experts and lay listeners by breaking down complex information into more digestible portions and allowing for immediate clarification.

38 Interviewer:

So, let's get on to these four papers then. So, this i a team of palaeontologists in China who have discovered several new fosils How did this come about?

# 39 Interviewer:

There's another question too. Was this a one-off event or were practices like this common in this area?

Conversely, the lower frequency of questions by scientists may signal their role as expertise contributors rather than inquirers. Ths dichotomy reinforces the distinct functions both host and scientis fulfll within the podcasts, with host driving the inquiry and scientists responding with authoritative expertise.

Furthermore, scientists use directives to instruct listeners towards pecific actions or interpretations (Hyland, 2005). These devices, potentially perceived as intrusive, may undermine listener autonomy and disturb the power equilibrium between scholars and their audience (Jiang & Qiu, 2022). This pragmatic concern may explain the relatively infrequent use of directives in the podcasts, much lower than the previously discussed listener-mention features. Podcasting discourse, thus, emerges as largely explanatory, seeking information from scientists rather than presenting authoritative directives. Notably, there exists a variance in directive usage: hosts primarily use them as navigate aids, signaling forthcoming sections (40), whereas scientists lean towards cognitive directives (Hyland, 2002) to steer readers through argumentation (41).

40 Interviewer:

So, consider the following hypothetical. Suppose, instead of growing up in a community where $4 0 \%$ of your friends are high. income, you grew up in a community where $7 0 \%$ of your friends are high-income.

# 5. Some observations and conclusions

We have explored how scientific knowledge published in journal articles is restructured and recontextualized in the digital context of the Nature Podcast. The weaving of formal scientifi discourse with informal conversational styles marks this podcast as a distinct genre, paralleling yet diverging from traditional academic text. This auditory platform presents a dynamic synthesis of scholarly expertise and relatable dialogues that effctively bridges the divide between researchers and wider audiences. Focusing on it generic structure, our analysis shows that four moves and ten steps are obligatory, and these structural regularities demonstrate the conscious orchestration required to encapsulate the intricacies of scientific research within the constraints of a podcast format. This structuring simplifies methodological nuances yet amplifies narratives that humanize science through discussions of research obstaces, motivations, and practical applications. The podcast does not shy away from integrating the \*humanistic element into it discussions, such as human experiences, personal emotions, anecdotes, and humor. Giving prominence to these human dimensions allows listners to forge meaningful connections with researchers, and grants rare glimpses into the personal side of scientific discovery.

This sensitivity and adaptability to new contexts is also evident in the ways speakers interact with their audience. Unlike formal research writing, the Nature Podcast embraces conversational dynamics facilitated by host-scientist dialogues. This colloquial nature. intertwined with narrtive-imbued discourse, explains scientists' use of linguistic features that convey heightened authorial positioning and evaluations, distinct from those found in RA abstracts. Whilescientis embrace a more personalized and engaging communicative approach, hosts assume a mediating role, unpacking and \*translating complex terminology and intricate technicalities for heterogeneous audiences. This mediation involves actively articulating attitudes and perspecties, and steering discussions through inquiries, aimed at seeking clarifications and injecting personality and approachability into scientific discussions.

The results have not only advanced our understanding of this science communication genre but also have important pedagogical implications. The Nature Podcast offrs educators a dynamic resourceto incorporate into classoom instruction. By exposing students to scientific discourse presented in an accessble narrative style, the podcast can help cultivate students' adaptive communication skil. This rource can be used for listeng exerces as model for student presnttions, or as a basis for dcussion and analysis of science communication strategies. In today's multifaceted knowledge-sharing milieu, the aility to distil scientific content into engaging narratives beyond academic spheres has become increasingly important. The guided practice can provide students training experience in tailoring language to general audiences, adopting colloquial language, and weaving anecdotes.

Incorporating podcasting projects into ESP currcula could engage students through lively, publicoriented communication. Explicit instruction on these linguistic adaptations could raise students' genre awareness. Indeed, Hyland (2023b) supports this, emphasizing that genre-based instruction yields the most impact inclaroom applications (p. 2) Furthermore, cllborative student podcast initiative could build valuable expertise, and this aids them in crafting scientifially rigorous yet engaging stories that adhere to podcasting norms. Through the hands-on process of anticipating audience needs, constructing narratives, and balancing scientific rigor with aesibility, students gain multifaceted skill to give specialized knowledge wider resonance beyond academic settings

This is, of course, a relatively small-scale study of only 40 transcriptions, and additional research is needed to further explore science communication via podcasts. Future investigations could benefit from expanding the corpus analysis to encompass a wider range of episodes, time periods, and scientific disciplines. Comparing leading science podcasts through corpus analysis may also highlight shared conventions alongside unique styles within the genre. Moreover, future research could adopt a multimodal approach to investigate how the linguistic strategies identified in this study interplay with auditory elements, like tone, strategic pausing, prominences, and background music/sound effct. Building on these early findings, further research can provide deer insights of the linguistic patterns and conventions that shape science communication in podcasting.
