# ABSTRACT

The study reported in this article investigated the use of quest-based learning (QBL) in a gamified English as a foreign language (EFL) course at a Japanese university. A mixed methods research design was utilised to explore the effect purposely designed quests can have on EFL students’ foreign language (FL) motivation. The study was conducted over a 14-week period with four intact classes of participants $( N = 8 9 )$ . The results of the study showed overwhelmingly positive opinions and perceptions towards QBL and provided evidence that QBL can increase intrinsic FL motivation while supporting FL learning. They suggest that the QBL supported intrinsic motivation because they were enjoyable, meaningful, suitably challenging, supported autonomy through quest choice, and interpersonally meaningful. The positive results were attributed to the quest design that leveraged specific aspec ts of multiple motivation theories (e.g., Self-determination theory, positive psychology). Three aspects that could hinder intrinsic motivation were also identified: (1) difficulty of the quests; (2) time required to complete the quests; and (3) quest choice allowing the participants to avoid certain quests.

# 1.  Introduction

Gamification is the use of game elements and game design techniques in non-game contexts to motivate specific behaviours (Werbach & Hunter, 2012). It has been applied to a wide range of domains with positive results (e.g., Schaffarczyk & Ilhan, 2019). Proponents of gamification assert that gamifying an activity makes the activity more engaging and motivating. However, critics of gamification say that, because gamification replaces meaningful incentives with fictional incentives, it will not be able to sustain engagement once the novelty wears off (Tsay,

Kofinas, Trivedi, & Yang, 2019). As gamification continues to become more integrated with various aspects of education, it is important to understand how it can impact learning outcomes.

When gamification is applied to the structure or content of an educational course, elements of the class are redesigned to be more game-like (Sheldon, 2011). For example, learning tasks could be designed as quests, completed quests are assessed using experience points, then experience points are presented on a class leaderboard. However, there is no simple and certain way to implement gamification in an educational context. There are a myriad of possible gamification components and mechanics that can be uniquely calibrated, independently applied, and interconnected with other gamification components to attempt to achieve a specific goal of an implementation. There is uncertainty about how certain combinations of gamification components and mechanics affect student performance and motivation (Çakıroğlu, Başıbüyük, Güler, Atabay, & Memiş, 2017; Dehghanzadeh, Fardanesh, Hatami, Talaee, & Noroozi, 2019). This has led to researchers requesting further studies that isolate specific gamification components in specific contexts to determine their effect on student outcomes such as motivation (e.g., Barata, Gama, Jorge, & Gonçalves, 2017; Landers, Bauer, Callan, & Armstrong, 2015; Perry, 2021).

Quests are one gamification component that have potential to support pedagogy in various ways such as fostering motivation towards the learning domain (Kapp, 2012). On the surface, quests are thematically packaged challenges that include an objective, instructions, and a corresponding reward that is given to the student if they can complete the quest successfully (Ashmore & Nitche, 2007). Below the surface, the purpose of the quest could be to encourage the student to learn or practice a new skill or have some type of meaningful experience. When utilised in an English as a foreign language (EFL) context, on the surface, quests appear as gamified language learning activities; below the surface, quests have the potential to foster intrinsic foreign language (FL) motivation while supporting second language (L2) acquisition (Sheldon, 2011). A quest shares a number of traits with traditional language learning tasks and webquests but differs due to the elements of gamification applied to them. Section 3.2 explains quests in more detail.

The use of quests in an educational setting is referred to as quest-based learning (QBL) (Haskell, 2012). QBL can be a stand-alone pedagogical approach, or it can be part of a gamified class, interconnected with other gamification components such as leaderboards, points, levels, badges, and a narrative (Sheldon, 2011). Teachers generally prepare a number of quests that strive to provide relevant learning experiences for their students who complete them over a semester or an academic year (e.g., Skrabut, 2021). The underlying assumption about QBL is that, because the quests appear game-like, this increases student engagement and intrinsic motivation as young people are more motivated by games than traditional learning content (Sheldon, 2011). However, literature supporting the assumption for the EFL context is lacking. There is also a lack of literature to explain how quests should be designed to achieve specific EFL-related goals. This article aims to determine the viability of QBL to be an intrinsically motivating approach to learning EFL.

# 2.  Fostering intrinsic motivation using quest-based learning

Evidence that supports the use of gamification in education is growing but is still lacking (e.g., Hanus & Fox, 2015; Lam, Hew, & Chiu, 2018; Rachels & Rockinson-Szapkiw, 2018), and is sometimes mixed or inconclusive (Domínguez et  al., 2013; Koivisto & Hamari, 2019; Seaborn, 2021). Studies supporting the use of gamification in the FL learning context are even further limited (Reinhardt, 2019). However, the literature that surrounds QBL suggests that Sheldon’s (2011) claim that QBL is a motivating pedagogical approach can be true in the EFL context if the design of the quests incorporates sound academic theory. The theory most commonly associated with gamification is Self-determination theory (SDT) (e.g., Sailer & Sailer, 2021).

The main premise of SDT is that, if a human’s psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness are fostered within a domain, they will be personally fulfilled, and intrinsically motivated to perform well and engage in that domain (Ryan & Deci, 2009). Investigations into the application of SDT to the EFL context (e.g., McEown, Noels, & Saumure, 2014) show a range of positive learning outcomes associated with students who report high levels of self-determined motivation. This section uses the three tenets (competence, autonomy, relatedness) of SDT as a framework to design L2/FL quests that foster intrinsic motivation. Aspects of positive psychology are also introduced to strengthen the SDT framework.

# 2.1.  Competence

The competence tenet of SDT suggests that quests should be suitably challenging for intrinsic motivation to foster. Lambert, Gong, and Harrison (2015) and Çakıroğlu et  al. (2017) support the notion that quests that are suitably challenging foster intrinsic motivation. They showed that students generally viewed QBL as more valuable and useful for learning compared to a traditional approach in an educational technology course. They hypothesised that the reasons for the results were because the participants had to demonstrate more competence to successfully complete the quest compared to a traditional course in which the participants would just receive their mark and then move on, and also because of the autonomous nature of the quests.

Çakıroğlu et  al. (2017) found positive student perceptions towards the use of quests as a pedagogical approach in an undergraduate information and communications technology course. Many of their participants explained that the quests required them to deeply consider how they were going to complete the quests. This not only made them feel motivated while completing the quests but also “facilitated deep learning” (p. 103). The participants’ explanation about how the feeling of motivation stemmed from requiring deep consideration suggests that the quests were motivating because they were suitably challenging. The findings from Lambert et  al. (2015) and Çakıroğlu et  al. (2017) alongside SDT theory (Ryan & Deci, 2009) suggest that quests that are suitably challenging will support intrinsic FL motivation.

# 2.2.  Autonomy

SDT suggests that quests need to support autonomy for intrinsic motivation to foster. QBL is suitably positioned to foster the autonomy tenet of SDT in two ways: first, by allowing the students a choice of what quest to work on; second, by allowing students the autonomy to make meaningful choices about how they complete the quests they work on. The type of autonomy quest choice can provide is strongly encouraged in the L2/FL literature (e.g., Benson, 2011) as an approach to foster resilient long-term L2/FL motivation. Game designer McGonigal (2011) says that the successful completion of a meaningful quest that provided autonomy and required a suitable degree of competence should reward the player intrinsically enough so that extrinsic rewards such as points or badges are inconsequential.

Providing a selection of quests to complete is a common aspect of QBL (e.g., Skrabut, 2021). Haskell (2012) conducted an experiment to determine the attractive and interesting features of quests that led to quests being chosen, completed, and highly rated by students in a university-level introductory educational technology course. 66 quests, divided into levels, covering a range of appropriate topics were developed and delivered to students on a purposefully designed QBL website. The results of Haskell’s study show that the students’ initial perception of the quest was important; the inclusion of various multimedia such as blogging, podcasting, and videos appeals to students; students are attracted to quests, which look like they can be completed quickly, and to task-based quests, which clearly show how they should be completed. Haskell found that, even though task-based quests are initially more appealing, the students enjoyed completing goal-based quests more, possibly due to them fostering stronger feelings of autonomy and competence. Sullivan, Mateas, and Wardrip-Fruin (2009) explain that task-based quests clearly describe a list of tasks that must be completed for the quest to be completed, whereas goal-based quests present the objective of the quest and allow the player the freedom to decide how they complete it.

De Schutter and Abeele (2014) also found that undergraduate students strongly agreed that choosing quests was motivating, enjoyable, and engaging. The students disagreed that the being able to choose which quest to work on aspect should be removed from the course. The literature (i.e., Benson, 2011; Haskell, 2012; De Schutter & Abeele, 2014) suggests that, by allowing students a choice of what quest to complete, and the autonomy to decide how it will be completed, intrinsic motivation can foster; however, this is not always true for all students. Çakıroğlu et  al. (2017) and Orsatti (2017) showed that a choice of too many quests can lead to feelings of being overwhelmed or bored for some students. Lambert (2017) also found that the students who already possess autonomous learning behaviour enjoyed QBL more than the students who do not possess autonomous learning behaviour. The students who did not already possess autonomous learning behaviour found QBL to be more challenging.

# 2.3.  Relatedness

SDT suggests that intrinsic motivation can be fostered through quests that support relatedness. Relatedness can increase self-determined motivation, and facilitate deeper engagement, higher achievement, and improved personal well-being (e.g., Hiromori, 2003). As collaboration and cooperation have been hallmarks of many games, QBL appears suitably positioned to foster the relatedness tenet of SDT through collaborative and cooperative quests. Lambert et  al. (2015) support the assertion by showing that students in an Educational Technology course who were subjected to QBL reported higher levels of relatedness compared to the students in the traditional version of the course, which resulted in a statistically higher effort that also corresponded with higher levels of enjoyment. Perry (2021) also found that shared positive emotions through collaboration was important for sustaining student engagement.

Collaboration and relatedness can be fostered through the design of the QBL system and through individual quest design. SDT suggests that collaboration should be fostered in an autonomous manner. Students should not constantly be forced to work with people who they may not want to work with; however, they should be provided extensive opportunities to collaborate. In an EFL context, environments that foster collaboration can reduce communication-related anxiety, which leads to increased self-confidence and motivation (Koga, 2010). The design of the quests should entice students to collaborate; however, collaboration should not be forced. Students who do not want to collaborate should be able to choose a different quest or be able to complete the quest in a manner that does not impact their autonomy. Ideally, once a student has successfully completed a collaborative quest or has seen the enjoyment another student received from completing a collaborative quest, they will feel more motivated to complete collaborative quests in the future (McGonigal, 2011).

# 2.4.  Positive psychology

Positive psychology can be built into quests to help further foster intrinsic motivation. Positive psychology states that psychological well-being occurs when people do meaningful and engaging activities that provide intrinsic rewards without high concern for extrinsic rewards (Lounis, Pramatari, & Theotokis, 2014). Seligman’s (2011) PERMA framework outlines five aspects to incorporate: positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment. The PERMA framework suggests two additional approaches to fostering intrinsic motivation that are not specifically addressed by SDT. First, quests should be interesting and enjoyable. Reeve (1989) found that “interest contributes to intrinsic motivation by arousing the initiation and direction of attention and exploratory behavior, while enjoyment contributes to intrinsic motivation by sustaining the willingness to continue and persist in the activity” (p. 83). Second, quests should be meaningful. Lyubomirsky (2007) suggests that quests should have meaningful goals and facilitate meaningful experiences on the way to completing the goal.

Building upon the literature review presented above, this study seeks to answer the following research questions:

1. What are students’ opinions and perceptions of quest-based learning in an EFL course?   
2. What are the effects of quest-based learning on foreign language motivation?

# 3.  Method

This study employed a quasi-experimental mixed methods research design. The study was conducted at a Japanese university over a 14-week period. A convenience sample (suggested in Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2011) recruited participants $\left( N = 8 9 \right)$ ) from four EFL courses at the host university. The study was quasi-experimental as random assignment of participants was not possible because the four participant groups were already members of intact classes that could not be separated. The mixed methods design is hybrid in nature as both convergent and explanatory sequential approaches are used (Creswell, 2015). The convergent mixed methods design merged quantitative and qualitative data. The explanatory sequential aspect of the design collected qualitative data to further investigate or support initial findings by allowing triangulation to occur. Appendix A shows the four stages of the research design process: (1) data collection, (2) data analysis in isolation, (3) merging of data and further exploration, (4) answering of research questions. The triangulation that occurs as part of the mixed methods process in Stage 3 aims to provide support to the reliability and validity of the findings.

# 3.1.  Participants

Participants in the study were second-year undergraduate students $\left( N { = } 8 9 \right)$ from four intact Intensive English classes at a Japanese university. The Intensive English classes were 90 minutes long each, three times a week for two 14-week semesters. This study occurred during the 14 weeks for the second semester. The four classes were categorised into two groups for the study: Group 1 $( n = 4 4 )$ acted as the experimental group and Group 2 $( n = 4 5 )$ ) acted as the control group. Both groups completed the same activities during the study (e.g., textbook, extensive reading, English Central, vocabulary quizzes); however, only the participants in Group 1 completed quests. Instead of quests, the participants in Group 2 completed standard homework activities, which were tasks created by the teacher that were connected to themes in the textbook. The first author of this article was the teacher for the two classes which made Group 1, and, as the study occurred in the second semester, the participants and the teacher had already established a relationship. The two classes that made Group 2 were taught by a different teacher. Prior to the commencement of the first semester, the participants’ TOEIC scores ranged between 575-625. They came from a range of departments within the university such as business, economics, law, sociology, and humanities. Informed consent was obtained from all participants before data collection began.

# 3.2.  Materials

Quests in this study were language learning tasks that the participants completed independent of the teacher. The quests were designed to increase intrinsic FL motivation while supporting L2 learning. All quests were designed to foster the three tenets of SDT to varying degrees; however, other psychological theories were used in conjunction with SDT to target other specific aspects of motivation. A range of theories and approaches (e.g., task-based language learning) were built into the quests to support actual language learning; however, further description is outside the scope of this article.

20 quests were developed, trialled (Philpott, 2016), and edited prior to the commencement of this study. 18 quests were included in this gamified course. To avoid overwhelming participants with a choice of 18 quests, levels were used to control the delivery of quests. The quests were categorised into levels based on themes and supporting academic theory. Seven levels were created; however, Level 1 was an introduction level that did not have any quests; Level 2 to Level 7 had three quests each. When a participant had completed at least two quests in a level, they could progress to the next level. The participants were told to complete one quest per week. The participants could do all three quests in a level; however, to progress to the end of the levels on schedule, it was recommended to only do two quests per level. Quests were assessed each week through a peer review system. Appendix B shows the outline and descriptions of all levels and quests. Figure 1 shows how Quest 3 in Level 2 was presented. More detailed information about each quest can be found online (https://sites.google.com/view/aphilpott/quest-based-learning).

A gamified digital ecosystem was designed that allowed the participants to easily produce, share, and take ownership of their completed quests. A Google Sites website was the centre point of the ecosystem. It had links to the quests, the quest scoring form, the blogs, and the leaderboards for Class 1. Blogger (www.blogger.com) was used to deliver quests to the participants. Each quest level had its own blog. The levels were connected using hyperlinks. The participants were told that they could click on the Change Level link once they had successfully completed two quests in a level. Completing a quest required a participant to get at least 30 of the 50 points. Blogger was also used as a privacy-controlled space for the participants to submit and share their completed quests. Blogger allowed for work to be commented on and allowed for the integration of various types of media such as sound recordings, videos, pictures, and PowerPoint presentations. All of the participants had their own blog, and each week they would do one post on their blog. The post had two sections: (1) a short personal diary entry, and (2) the outcome of the quest they completed. It was hoped that the writing and sharing of a personal diary would be another avenue to foster the tenets of SDT through authentic FL use. Figure 2 shows how a participant’s blog appeared at the end of the study.

Every Friday in class, a website was used to randomly assign each participant two blog posts to check. The participants checked the blog posts by reading the diary entry and then assessing the completed quest based on the quest objective and the point scoring system. The quest scoring system relied on the participants to accurately assess each other’s work; the teacher would occasionally check the accuracy of the assessments. Having the participants assess each other served two purposes. First, it ensured that the participants’ work would be shared. Second, it greatly decreased the burden on the teacher to assess 44 quests each week. The scores were submitted to the teacher using a Google Form (forms.google.com) that was embedded on the class website. After completing the form, the participants were encouraged to write a comment in the comments section of the blog they assessed. There was no requirement for how long the comment should be or what the comment should be about. However, the participants were encouraged to use this commenting phase as an opportunity for social communication rather than critical feedback. Each quest was graded by two different participants. The teacher checked for score discrepancies and then input the quest scores into Google Sheets for tracking.

# 3.3.1.  The Language Learning Orientations Scale

The Language Learning Orientations Scale (LLOS) is a multi-item psychometric scale questionnaire that measures students’ L2 motivational orientation from an SDT perspective (Noels, Pelletier, Clément, & Vallerand, 2000). The LLOS measures seven different types of motivation: three types of extrinsic motivation, three types of intrinsic motivation, and amotivation. Each of the seven subscales is measured using three statements that the participants read and decide how strongly they agree with it using a 7-point scale (1: does not correspond, 2: corresponds very little, 3: corresponds a little, 4: corresponds moderately, 5: corresponds a lot, 6: corresponds almost exactly, 7: corresponds exactly). No major changes were made to the LLOS as Noels et  al. (2000) showed it to be internally consistent and sufficiently reliable (Based on Kline, 1999). The LLOS was administered in Japanese to all participants as a pre-test and a post-test to determine if the participants’ FL motivation changed over the duration of the study. Appendix C shows the complete list of questionnaire items.

# 3.3.2.  Quest diaries

The student diaries, referred to as quest diaries, collected data from all the participants in Group 1 about their retrospective thoughts towards the specific quests they completed and QBL in general. The participants wrote in their quest diaries at the end of each level from Level 2 to Level 6; approximately every two weeks. The participants were told that they could write about anything they wanted; however, they were encouraged to write about why they chose to do a quest, and what they thought about the quest. The quest diary completed at the end of Level 7 asked the participants to reflect on the entire QBL experience. The participants completed the quest diaries outside of class time or during the assigned game-time in Friday’s class. It took the participants approximately 5 to 20 minutes to complete a quest diary entry. A quest diary was created for and shared with each participant using Google Docs. The participants could use Japanese or English to write in their quest diaries; however, they were told to use Japanese if they could not express themselves clearly in English.

# 3.3.3.  Semi-structured interviews

Semi-structured interviews were used to expand on and clarify already collected data. The interviews were conducted in Japanese by a Japanese graduate student at the host university. Based on a combination of Patton’s (2015) purposeful sampling strategies, participants for the interview were chosen based on availability, willingness to participate, and various predetermined criteria (e.g., gender, motivational inclination, class performance) that ensured a wide range of participants’ views were represented. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine participants from Group 1. Each interview lasted for about 15–20 minutes. Appendix D shows the base interview questions.

# 3.4.  Procedures

The LLOS surveys were conducted using SurveyMonkey (www.surveymonkey.com) in Weeks 1 and 14. The participants wrote in their quest diaries every two weeks from Week 4 to Week 14. The semi-structured interviews were conducted in Week 14. The semi-structured interviews were recorded using two audio recording devices. The audio recordings were transcribed and translated into English by the interviewer soon after the interviews had finished. The English translations were sent to a different bilingual graduate student who back-translated the texts into Japanese. Any differences between the original Japanese text and the back-translated text were resolved by the two translators through discussion. This process of back-translation ensured the accuracy of the English translations. The same translation process was also conducted on the quest diary data.

# 3.5.  Data Analysis

Paired samples $t { \cdot }$ -tests were conducted on the LLOS data using SPSS version 25. Thematic quantitative content analyses (adapted from Cohen et  al., 2011) were performed on the quest diary and semi-structured interview data using NVIVO version 12. The first stage of coding included structural coding, open coding, and sentiment coding. The second stage of coding created axial codes that categorised the open codes based on emerging themes in the data. As recommended by Lynch (2003), an external code checker checked the accuracy of the codes by coding a section of the text based on the codebook. The inter-coder reliability results were acceptable based on the minimal benchmark of $8 5 - 9 0 \%$ (Saldaña, 2015). The codes were then also analysed using rank order comparison of frequency as the large number of responses made the data suitable for this type of analysis.

# 4.  Results

# 4.1.  LLOS Results

Figure 3 shows the change in mean scores for each of the LLOS subscales from the paired-samples $t { \cdot }$ -tests. The results of the amotivation subscale have been omitted as both the pre- and post-test scores were so low that they suggested amotivation was not a factor that required further consideration in this context. The combined average extrinsic motivation (EM) is an average of the three external subscales. This is because the LLOS measures extrinsic motivation on a continuum (Noels et  al., 2000). The combined total intrinsic motivation (IM) subscale was created by adding the three intrinsic motivation subscales together. Unlike extrinsic motivation, the intrinsic motivation subscales are standalone entities. The Combined EM and IM subscales show that in summary, extrinsic motivation remained the same for both groups; however, intrinsic motivation increased for Group 1 but declined for Group 2.

Table 1 presents the results of the paired samples $t { \cdot }$ -tests that were conducted on the LLOS pre-test and post-test mean scores for Group 1. For the external motivation subscales, the results reported no statistically significant changes. Statistically significant results were recorded for two of the intrinsic motivation subscales. First, the results reported a statistically significant $\left( p < . 0 5 \right)$ difference in the mean score for the Stimulation pre-test $( M = 3 . 7 2$ , $S D = 1 . 4 2 { \it \Omega }$ ) and Stimulation post-test $\mathit { M } = 4 . 1 0$ , $S D = 1 . 3 5 )$ ), $t ( 4 3 ) { = } - 2 . 0 6$ , $ { p ^ { \mathrm { ~ = ~ } . 0 4 5 } }$ . The statistically significant rise $\left( p < . 0 5 \right)$ for the Stimulation subscale suggests that intrinsic motivation could have increased due to the positive feelings (i.e., fun or excitement) associated with doing the quests in English. Second, the results reported a statistically significant $( p < . 1 0 )$ difference in the mean scores for the Combined IM pre-test $\scriptstyle \langle M = 3 . 7 2$ , $S D { = } 1 . 1 2 _ { _ { \circ } }$ ) and Combined IM post-test $\left( M = 3 . 9 9 \right.$ , $S D = 1 . 2 5 )$ , $t ( 4 3 ) = - 1 . 8 5$ , $p = . 0 7 0$ . Even though not statistically significant at the $< ~ . 0 5$ level, it is approaching significance and does suggest a change occurred.

# 4.2.  Quest diary results

This section presents the results of the content analysis that was conducted on the quest diary data. Figures 4–7 are used for each data set to clearly show the most frequently coded thematic categories. The words in brackets following each theme show the most frequently coded sub-categories for that theme, listed from most frequent to least frequent. The sub-categories will be further explained in the Discussion section.

# 4.2.1.  Opinions of individual quests

At the end of each level, the participants wrote their opinions about the two quests they completed. A total of 904 codes were applied to the data set $( n = 4 0 )$ ; $6 7 \%$ of the codes represented personal feelings, and $3 3 \%$ of the codes reflected some type of learning experience. Figure 4 shows the $1 0 \mathrm { \ m o s t }$ frequently coded thematic categories. The results do not represent any single quest but do represent a combination of all responses to each completed quest. The most common themes suggest that the participants had positive opinions about the quests they completed.

# 4.2.2.  Perceptions of quest-based learning

In the final quest diary, the participants wrote about what they liked and did not like about QBL as an approach to learning EFL. A total of 96 codes were applied to the data set $n = 4 2$ ). Figure 5 displays the most frequently coded thematic categories of responses. As the participants were told to write about things they liked and disliked about quests, the results do not represent overall sentiment but do highlight areas of interest. The positive themes suggest that the QBL was an intrinsically motivating approach to learning EFL. The negative themes suggest ways in which QBL could negatively impact intrinsic L2 motivation. While most of the themes in Figure 5 relate to education and motivation, point 6 and point 8 are unique to gamification. Point 6 shows that some of the participants appreciated being able to choose which quest to work on. Point 8 suggests that the use of levels to control the delivery of learning content was appreciated by some participants.

# 4.2.3.  Quest choice

At the end of each level, the participants wrote about why they chose to do the specific quests they did. A total of 355 codes were applied to the data set $( n = 4 0 )$ . Figure 6 shows the 10 most frequently coded thematic categories of responses. The results show that $3 5 \%$ of the codes represent wanting a personal experience (i.e., 4, 6 b, 8, 9, 10), $2 8 \%$ represent wanting a learning experience (i.e., 2, 5), $2 3 \%$ represent choosing a quest based on its appearance (i.e., 1, 3), and $1 3 \%$ represent choosing a quest to avoid a different quest (i.e., 6a).

In the final quest diary, the participants shared their opinions about whether the teacher or the participant should choose which quest to do. Figure 7 shows the results of the content analysis that was performed on the responses $n = 4 2 )$ ). The results clearly show that most of the participants prefer choosing which quest to work on. Figure 7 also shows the reasons why a participant made their decision.

# 4.2.4.  Collaboration aspect of quest-based learning

In the final quest diary, the participants shared their opinions about the collaboration aspect of QBL. Table 2 shows that $6 8 \%$ of the responses were positive, $5 \%$ of the responses were negative, and $2 7 \%$ of the responses were the participants explaining that they did not collaborate. Table 2 also presents the subcategories for each major theme.

# 4.3.  Semi-Structured interview results

Table 3 presents the results of the content analysis that was conducted on the participants’ semi-structured interview transcripts. The results are categorised into four main themes that subsume several positive, neutral, and negative sub-categories. The results provide a quick summary of the semi-structured interview findings. The greater frequency of positive sub-categories suggest that the participants generally felt positively towards the quests. More detailed accounts of the participants’ perceptions are presented in the Discussion section.

# 5.  Discussion

# 5.1.  How QBL supports intrinsic motivation

The LLOS data clearly show that for Group 1 intrinsic motivation increased and extrinsic motivation remained the same. These results were expected as the quests were designed to increase students’ intrinsic FL motivation. This section discusses five possible reasons why the QBL experience increased the participants intrinsic L2 motivation, and three aspects that could potentially hinder intrinsic motivation and FL learning.

# 5.1.1.  Autonomy

The quests possibly fostered intrinsic L2 motivation because they supported autonomy. The results of the quest diary data analysis show various examples of the quests supporting autonomy. First, they showed that the participants overwhelming responded that it is better if the participant chooses which quest to work on. The reasons for wanting to choose which quest to work on suggest that the autonomy fostered through quest choice supports intrinsic motivation by allowing participants to choose personally interesting quests, and quests that are suitable for their current competence threshold. This finding supports De Schutter and Abeele (2014) who also found that students strongly agreed that they should be able to choose which quest to work on, and choosing quests was motivating, enjoyable, and engaging.

Second, the reasons for choosing to do a quest also provide examples of quest choice supporting intrinsic motivation through autonomy. The finding that the participants most often choose quests because they looked easy or quick to finish directly supports Haskell (2012) who found the same result. On the surface, the finding could suggest that the participants were avoiding meaningful learning activities in favour of simple learning activities. However, from an SDT perspective, the finding hints that autonomy was supported, at least not negatively impacted, by not forcing the participants to do quests they did not want to do.

The second most frequent reason for choosing to do a quest suggests that quest choice supported the competence aspect of SDT by allowing the participants to choose quests that were suitable for their EFL competence threshold. Regarding the remaining reasons, according to the positive psychology literature (e.g., Seligman, 2011), the participants choosing a quest because it looked interesting, fun, or enjoyable, or choosing a quest because they wanted to reflect on their life suggest that quests have potential to increase intrinsic motivation through meaningful activities and positive emotions. The participants choosing a quest because they wanted to share something about themselves suggest that they are choosing quests, which have the potential to foster intrinsic motivation through relatedness.

# 5.1.2.  Competence

The quests possibly fostered intrinsic L2 motivation because they supported competence. The participants were not specifically asked if the quests were challenging; however, various results from the data analysis suggest that the quests were suitably challenging. First, in response to the individual quests, $8 3 \%$ of the participants mentioned at least once that a quest was challenging but they could complete it in the end. Participant 31’s reflection of Quest 11 exemplifies the challenge and accomplishment feeling:

For this quest, I interviewed a foreign exchange student. At first, I thought it would be hard for a Japanese person to interview an exchange student only in English. I can’t communicate well and wasn’t sure if my English would be ok. So, I prepared well, and the interview went smoothly. I think I could learn the manner to communicate with exchange students. (Participant 31)

Second, when the participants reflected on their QBL experience, the seventh most common perception was that it was challenging but resulted in the participant learning something. Third, in the semi-structured interviews, $5 5 \%$ of the participants said that the quests were initially difficult but became easier. The three instances of challenge provide possible evidence that the QBL experience fostered intrinsic motivation by providing a suitable level of challenge that the participants were able to manage successfully. This finding supports Lambert et  al. (2015) and Çakıroğlu et  al. (2017) who also found that quests that are suitably challenging foster intrinsic motivation.

# 5.1.3.  Relatedness

The quests possibly fostered intrinsic L2 motivation because they supported relatedness. The data showed various instances of the QBL implementation facilitating meaningful interpersonal experiences. This is important because, if the participants did not enjoy the collaboration aspect, this could negatively affect their intrinsic motivation; perceived forced collaboration could lead to feelings of being controlled, which is the opposite of intrinsic motivation according to SDT (Ryan & Deci, 2009). The participants explained that the collaboration aspect of QBL was enjoyable, provided good opportunities to interact with the other participants, strengthened existing relationships, and allowed them to make new friends. Some examples that highlight the participants’ positive perceptions of the collaboration aspect of QBL include:

For one of the quests, my friend and I interviewed each other about the jobs we want to do in the future. It was a good experience because it was the first time to actually record myself speaking in English. I also found out that my friend is thinking seriously about her future, so it made me motivated. (Participant 1)

I could enjoy the quests more when working with other people rather than doing by myself. (Participant 44)

Most of the participants clearly enjoyed the collaboration aspect of QBL. This finding supports Lounis et  al. (2014) who also found a preference in gamified contexts for collaboration on activities rather than doing them individually. This is important because in gamified environments, collaboration can increase performance and motivation (Ryan, Rigby, & Przybylski, 2006). In an EFL context, collaboration can reduce communication-related anxiety, which leads to increased self-confidence and motivation (Koga, 2010). The finding that the quests fostered relatedness supports Lambert et  al. (2015) who also found that QBL was able to foster relatedness more than a traditional classroom experience, which lead to higher levels of enjoyment. The finding is also in line with Perry (2021) who found that the shared positive emotions that foster through collaboration is important for sustaining engagement.

# 5.1.4.  Enjoyment

The quests possibly supported intrinsic L2 motivation because they were enjoyable. The participants’ reflections on the individual quests they completed clearly show that enjoyment was a common theme. For example, Participant 43’s reflection of Quest 5 exemplifies the enjoyment feeling of doing an activity using English:

I chose Quest 10 because it seemed not difficult and I like watching English videos. Watching English news in Quest10 was very good for studying English.

It was good listening practice and I could learn news, so it was like killing two birds with one stone. (Participant 43)

This interview excerpt highlights two aspects, which were enjoyable, the social and creative aspects:

In the beginning, I only did the writing quests because they were quick to finish, but I gradually started working on videos and discussion quests. I was reluctant to record a video at first, but I tried it and it was really fun and I was able to enjoy studying. (Participant 1)

Lambert et  al. (2015) found that students enjoy QBL because it was suitably challenging. The finding from this study that the participants perceived QBL as an enjoyable experience supports Lambert et  al. (2015) and further shows how the autonomous nature of QBL leads to enjoyment if the participants can explore content they are interested in, without being forced.

# 5.1.5.  Meaningfulness

The quests possibly supported intrinsic L2 motivation because they were meaningful. The positive psychology literature (e.g., Seligman, 2011) explains that intrinsic motivation can foster through activities that are personally meaningful. The participants’ reflections on the individual quests they completed and QBL in general show many instances of the participants’ feeling that the QBL experience was meaningful or useful. The participants often said that a quest encouraged meaningful personal reflection about their lives and English ability. In response to Quest 2, for example, Participant 32 wrote:

I chose Quest 2 because I never think about my strengths and weaknesses. It was difficult for me to find out what my strengths and weaknesses are. After I finished the quest, I found out what I should do to improve myself.

In her semi-structured interview, Participant 12 explained,

The questions that I answered during the quests were not questions I usually think about. For example, I had to explain why I study English. I don’t really talk or think about that myself, so it was a good opportunity to reflect on it.

Lamb and Arisandy (2020) encourage learners to engage in English usage outside of the classroom. The quests were meaningful because they occurred in an engaging real-world context. Perry (2021) and Orsatti (2017) also reflected on how the non-traditional classroom, real-world context of QBL was an important aspect of their success. The examples of quests fostering a range of meaningful experiences could suggest that positive psychology was successfully incorporated into the quests to support intrinsic FL motivation growth.

# 5.2.  How QBL hinders intrinsic motivation and FL learning

Even though the participants generally had positive opinions and perceptions towards the QBL experience, the data reveal three aspects of QBL that could hinder intrinsic motivation and FL learning. First, some of the participants explained that a quest was either difficult for their English ability, difficult to achieve the goal of the quest, or technically difficult. Second, some of the participants explained that some of the quests were too time consuming. According to SDT (Ryan & Deci, 2009), if a participant is overwhelmed by the challenge, or finds some aspect unnecessarily troublesome, it is potentially demotivating. The concern about unsuitable challenge being demotivating adds to the literature (e.g., Çakıroğlu et  al., 2017; Orsatti, 2017) that reported that a large number of quests or timer consuming quests is demotivating for some participants.

The third concern is about quest choice limiting the ability of quests to foster intrinsic motivation. Even though quest choice was generally seen as a positive aspect of QBL, the data show that the participants most often chose quests that looked easy or quick to finish. This finding directly supports Haskell (2012) who also found the same. It is a significant finding as it shows a paradox about fostering autonomy through quest choice. On one hand, allowing a choice of quest to complete supports the fostering of intrinsic motivation through autonomy. On the other hand, it leads to some students choosing quests that are simple to complete, rather than beneficial to complete. The worry that quest choice could lead to the participants avoiding certain types of quests was shown to be a legitimate concern with $2 7 \%$ of the participants stating they never chose quests that required collaboration.

# 6.  Conclusion

This study examined the use of QBL in an EFL context to determine its viability as an intrinsically motivating approach to learning EFL. Student opinions and perceptions were explored alongside data collected from the LLOS. The LLOS data clearly showed an increase in intrinsic FL motivation for the participants who completed quests in the study. Qualitative data collected from quest diaries and semi-structured interviews supported the LLOS findings and further suggested that the quests were intrinsically motivating because they were enjoyable, meaningful, suitably challenging, supported autonomy through quest choice, and interpersonally meaningful. Some concerning results that could possibly hinder intrinsic FL motivation emerged from the data. Specifically, the results warned that, if quests are too difficult or time consuming, or if participants choose quests based on how easy they look rather than how beneficial they are, then intrinsic motivation could be negatively impacted. However, the concerning results were greatly outweighed by the positive results.

The positive results support the theoretical framework and suggest that the strength of the QBL system came from the combination of pedagogies and theories that were incorporated in the design. As QBL generally occurs over at least a semester period, not every quest has to foster deep competence, autonomy, relatedness, and meaningfulness for the QBL system to successfully increase the students’ intrinsic FL motivation. However, the design of the QBL should avoid situations in which competence, autonomy, and relatedness are negatively impacted. The findings about QBL are significant as they explore deeper and wider than any other enquiries into QBL, especially for the EFL context. The findings are especially significant for the Japanese context, in which low intrinsic FL motivation is blamed as the cause for Japanese students’ poor English performance (e.g., Ushioda, 2013), as it provides a promising approach to increase FL motivation.

The findings of the study come with limitations. First, for the quantitative data analysis, a larger sample size would lead to more reliable results. Second, the sample was a group of Japanese students who were the same age and had a similar EFL ability. While the findings provide insight into the use of gamification, specifically, QBL, in a Japanese university EFL context, they cannot be extrapolated to other groups who have a different age, nationality, or language ability. Future studies can target other aspects of quest-based learning such as points and levels to determine how they impact motivation in different contexts.
