Lexical coverage

TED talks and TED-Ed animations have been widely used in English language courses to facilitate the learning of general and general academic English. However, little is known about their potential as resources for learning specific academic English. This study helps to fill this gap by examining, from a lexical perspective, their potential as learning materials for English for science and technology (EsT). Specifically, it analyzes specialized vocabulary in two corpora, one of science and technology TED talks and the other, of science and technology TED-Ed animations. The results show that, given their high coverage of specialized vocabulary (comparable to that of science lectures), both these types of material may be useful in EST instruction. In particular, the TED talks may serve as bridging materials for EST beginners, while the TED-Ed animations may be more suitable for familiarizing students with specialized words that are infrequent in general English. Also, because TED-Ed animations are comparable to written science texts in terms of their coverage of specialized vocabulary, they may be especially useful as materials for EST vocabulary learning.

# 1. Introduction

To achieve academic success second language (L2) learners sudying the hard sciences in English-medium universities not only need to comprehend reading materials such as textbooks and research papers, but must also understand various types of spoken discourse including lectures, sminars, laboratry sessons, and utorials. As comprehension i cosely relatd to vocabulary knowledge (Van Zeeland & Schitt, 2013), it s mortant for thee leners to mastr thos words that are frquently usd in the fll rang tr own disciplines' academic-discourse types. To that end, word is representing the most important words in groups of hard-science disciplines and particular disciplines have been developed. For example, Coxhead and Hirsh's (2007) EAP Science List documents frequent vocabulary in hard-sciences academic texts, and Dang's (2018a) Hard Science Spoken Word List (HswL) contains words frequently encountered in hard cience speech. Lis of the most important words in engineering (Ward, 2009), medicine (Dang, 2020; Wang et al., 2008), and computer science (Chen & Lei, 2019; Roesler, 2021) have also been created.

These word lists are valuable both as standalone vocabulary resources and as guides for materials design and curriculum devel. opment (Vukovic-Stamatovic, 2022). They are also often employed in lexical profiling studies' examinations of the extent to which specialized vocabulary occurs in a particulardiscourse tye. Such analyses can usefull inform teachers identification and selection of suitable materials for specialized English courses.

The potential of Technology, Education, and Design (TED) talks and TED's youth and education initiative (TED-Ed) animations for use in English for academic/specific purposes (EAP/ESP) instruction isvast. Past studies have shown that both provide a rich coverage of academic vocabulary (Liu, 2023c; Liu & Chen, 2019; Wingrove, 2017, 2022). Liu (2023a) further revealed the potential for inci. dental learning of medical vocabulary through viewing TED talks related to that discipline. TED talks and TED-Ed animations have been widely used in EAP courses and their pedagogical value for English Learning and Teaching (ELT) has been widely recognized (Nurmukhamedov, 2017; Wingrove, 2017). Nevertheles, research on their potential for use in ESP instruction remains relatively rare. TED talks and TED-Ed animations about science and technology belong to the science-popularization genre, which can be deemed "a key element of academic discourse" (Hyland, 2009 p.173). Given their popularity, widespread dissemination, and the fact that they provide an easily accessble channel for conveying scientific information to a non-specialized public, TED talks' and TED-Ed ani mations' suitability as materials for EST instuction is likely to be high. To test this idea, the present study wil examine specialized vocabulary from EAP Science List (Coxhead & Hirsh, 2007) and the Hard Science Spoken Word List (Dang, 2018a) in these two genres, and investigate how they are similar to or different from each other and in comparison to a sample of science lectures in terms of specialized vocabulary. As well as judging the suitability of TED tals and TED-Ed animations as potential materials for EST instruction, this study willhighlight lexical differences among spoken-discourse types associated with science and technology.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Vocabulary in specialized texts

The vocabulary that makes up a specialized text may include several different registers, e.g., high-frequency general words, academic word, and specialized words. According to Coxhead (2016), academic words, also referred to as general/core academic words, are those that occur frequently across a range of academic subject areas, and are usuall mid-frequency vocabulary items (Warnby, 2023). Unsurprisingly, they are commonly set as vocabulary goals for students learning English for general academic purposes (EGAP). On the other hand, specialized words, also ofen referred to as disciplinary words, are those that appear particularly frequently i a group of related subject areas (e.g., physics and math) or in just one such area (e.g., Chinese medicine), but that are rather rare in others. Learning them is considered important vocabulary aim for students learning English for specific academic purposes (EsAP). In comparison with general academic words, they are generally in the lower-frequency bands. Past research reveals that audiovisual-supported viewing has a positive relationship with knowledge of both academic vocabulary (Warnby, 2022) and disci. plinary vocabulary (Liu, 2023a), suggesting the presence of incidental learning opportunities.

It i esential for ESP learners to learn specialized words, as they tend to make up a high proportion of the words in specialized texts (Chung & Nation, 2004; Dang, 2020; Nation, 2016). Nation (2001) estimated that there were 1,00 specialized words in each subject area, which collectively accounted for around $5 \%$ of the words in a given specialized text in that area. Chung and Nation (2004), on the other hand, reported much higher proportions of specialized vocabulary in anatomy $( 3 1 . 2 \% )$ and applied linguistics texts $( 2 0 . 6 \% )$ . The same authors also found much larger numbers of specialized words in those subject areas than Nation suggested, i.e, more than 4,000 in the case of anatomy. More recently, Dang (2020) noted that specialized words make up $1 3 . 4 \%$ of medical lectures and seminars. In any case, due to the lage number of specialized words that exist, inabilit t recognize thee lexical items or their specalized meanings can have a large negative impact on learners comprehension of specialized texts and speech. The many specialized word lists developed to address this problem benefit learners by highlighting the most important words in their specific disciplines, and thus providing a shortcut to reduce their learning burdens (Nation, 2001). Learners may also be motivated to study these word lis if they come to recognize that what they learn in their nglish courses is closely related to what they learn in their subject courses (Hyland, 2016).

When it comes to developing EST learners technology-specific/science-disciplinary vocabulary knowledge, two specialized word lists may be especill useful, as they respectively represent the most frequent words that are used across subject aeas in writing and speech in hard science. They are the EAP Science List (EAP SL, Coxhead & Hirsh, 2007) and the Hard Science Spoken Word List (Dang, 2018a). The EAP SL contains 318 word familie extracte from a1.7-millon-word corpus of written texts from 14 subject areas in the hard sciences It should be noted that none of those words were on the General Service List (West, 1953), a general word list, or the Academic Word List (AWL; Coxhead, 200), a general academic word list. Other general academic word lists such as the Academic Vocabulary List (AVL, Gardner & Davies, 2014) were not consulted, although some EAP SL items are also AVL items (e., onserve, horizontal, align). The EAP SL was found to provide $3 . 8 \%$ coverage of written science texts.

Dang's (2018b) Hard Science Spoken Word List (HSwL), developed to represent the frequent words in hard-science speech. contains 1,595 word families. Unlike the EAP SL (Coxhead & Hirsh, 2007), the HSwL does not exclude word families that carry specialized meanings but also have high frequency in general use. This choice was made to avoid making a possibly incorrect assumption that students already know the pecialized meanings of high-frequency words (.., the most frequent 2,00 word families) before studying the HswL. Instead, the HswL word families have been graded into four levels according to the BNC/coCA word family list (Nation, 2012) to show their frequency in general use. More specificall, the firt, second, and third levels of HSWL respectively contain word familie from within the frt, second, and third BNc/cocA1,000-word-family frequency bands. The fourth level of HswL contain word families beyond the first three BNc/cocA frequency bands. Thus, if a group of students has already mastered the first two BNc/cocA frequency bands, their teacher can simply focus on the level 3 and 4 HsWL word families. Such alignment between general and specialized word lists can help teachers and students more effectively target learning aims involving specialized words. s compared to the Academic Spoken Word Lis (AswL, Dang e al., 2017), a general academic spoken word list the HSWL has been found to provide higher coverage in a hard-science spoken corpus, despite being shorter (Dang, 2018a). This suggests that the HsWL has the greater value of the two as vocabulary support for understanding hard-science speech.

The EAP SL and the HswL are not only used directly as vocabulary learning goals, but also in lexical coverage studies of various discourse types, often aimed at ssessig such types' suitaility for EST instruction. For example, Rlls and Rodgers (2017) examined the EAP SL coverage of a corpus of science-fiction/fantasy texts as a means of ascertaining such text' potential as materials for incidental learning of specialized hard-science words. They found that allthe EAP SL word families except anion appeared in the corpus, with around $4 4 \%$ of those families being encountered more than 10 times. However, they collectively covered only about $0 . 5 \%$ of the word tokens in the corpus, meaning that a reader would, on average, encounter one such word token among every 199 words when reading the science-fiction/fantasy texts. This figure is lower than the equivalent for academic science journals, but higher than for general iction. The researchers concluded that science-fiction/fantasy texts, in comparison with general fiction, might serve as bridging matrial fo students planing to study the hard science. Yet, in light of their rather low coverage level, such texts should not be considered core materials for learning hard-science words, but would serve better as supplementary resources.

By examining their coverage by the EAP SL, Vukovic-Stamatovic (2020a) explored the potential suitability of seven physics genres - i.e., popular books, magazines, textbooks, research articles, TV documentaries, lectures, and TED talks - for learning English for physics. That analysis showed that EAP SL coverage ranged from $1 . 3 8 \%$ to $3 . 8 8 \%$ with research articles, textbooks and magazines having relatively high coverage. Subsequently, Vukovic-Stamatovic (2020b) explored the suitability of popular science books as materials for learning English for cience vocabulary by examining EAP SL coverage in a two-million-word corpus of such texts, and established that such coverage was $1 . 5 \%$ . Based on this rather low figure, the same author suggested that such books might not be suitable as core materials for leaning English for science. Instead, they could be more suitable as materials for helping novice students bridge the gap between the learning of general English and specialized English.

More recently, Vukovic-Stamatovic (2022) compared science/technology documentaries' and academic lectures' coverage of the EAP SL and the HSWL, to determine their suitability as materials for EST instruction. The results indicated that such documentaries featured fairly similar amounts of specialized vocabulary to academic lectures, with the EAP SL covering $1 . 4 \%$ and the HSWL, $8 6 . 1 \%$ of the words in the texs. On that basis, it was sugested that science/technology documentaries are suitable materials for ET instruction.

The studies reviewed above demonstrated the pedagogical value of using specialized word lis to examine how much specialized vocabulary occurs in different enre. Such analysis can help determine how suitable particular gere i for ESP instruction, and also shed light on how different genres may be more or lessuseful as materials for leaners of pecialized vocabulary in various disciplines, depending on factors including their coverage of such lexical items and how frequently such learners may encounter them. Such analysis can not only enrich the options available for ESP instruction, but also help ESP teachers select suitable materials for their students with diverse English proficiency levels.

# 2.2. Specialized vocabulary in TED talks and TED-Ed animations

TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to spreading ids, usually through short, memorable talks covering almost ll topics (TED. com, 2022). It best-known resources that are popularly used in ELT are TED tals and TED-Ed animations (Nurmukhamedov, 2017). A TED talk is a short presentation, lasting $1 8 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ or less, in which an expert presents his/her innovative ideas, up-to-date research findings, and/or insights on atopic to a non-specialized audience. TED-Ed animations, on the other hand, are an ever-growing library of high-quality animated videos, usually between 5 and $1 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ in length, created collaboratively by groups of experts that may include TED speakers, science writers, educators, animators, and designers. Like TED talks, these animations feature arich variety of topics related to a wide range of academic subject areas.

In addition to being used for general English learning, TED talks and TED-Ed animations are increasingly popular in EAP courses. The former have been deemed particularly helpful to EAP learners' academic listening skls and academic vocabulary development (De Chazal, 2014). Tertiary-level learning materials centering on TED talks have also been developed, and include 21st Century Communication (Baker et a., 2017), Keynote (Dummet t al., 2016-2018), and Perspectives (Barber et al., 2018). Wingrove (2017) suggested that TED talks can be useful material for various academic listening activitie. Liu and Chen (2019) found TED talks to be comparable to academic lectures in terms of the coverage of spoken academic vocabulary, suggesting their potential for preparing EAP learners to listen to academic lctures and creating rich opportunities for them to ee how such vocabulary items are used in academic contexts. Wingrove (2022) subsequently reported that TED talks topic tags particularly those asociated with academic topics, can be used by teachers as useful guides to those more suitable for use in EAP courses. Although Liu (2023c) found that TED-Ed animations had lower overall coverage of academic vocabulary than academic lectures, they in fact contained a similar amount of lower-frequency academic vocabulary, i.., acadmic words that are frequenly used but that fl outsie the most frequent 2,00 gneral word familie. It was therfore concluded that these animations could stll be suitable instructional materials, especiall for academic vocabulary that is not frequently used in general English.

In addition to academic vocabulary, TED talks and TED-Ed animations may be pedagogically valuable to learners of specialized vocabulary specific to a particular subject area or a group of similar subject areas. Nurmukhamedov's (2017) research on the vocabulary profiles of TED talk further noted the ocurrence of pecialized vocabulary in them, and recommended that instructors have students watch a series of TED talks asociated with the same topic to increase thir exposure to specialized words. Finkenstaedt-Quinn et al. (2018), who integrated TED-Ed animations into STEM activities, indicated that such animations were helpful supplementary materials that facilitated students' understanding of both concepts and facts in the associated subject matter.

The studies reviewed above show the pedagogical promise of incorporating TED talks and TED-Ed animations into ESP instruction, particularly on specialized vocabulary. Yet, hardly any research has explored the extent to which specialized vocabulary occurs in them. One study that did address this ssue was Liu's (2023a) analys of medical vocabulary in medicine-related TED talks. Is results suggested the potential for incidental learning of specialized words in medicine through viewing medicine-related TED talks, as they contain a solid share of medical terms, many of which occur repeatedly. Specifically, 861 $( 9 6 . 2 \% )$ of the 895 medical words from Medical Spoken Word List (MWL) (Dang, 2020) occurred in the TED talks, at the rate of around 100 words per tlk, and nearly $6 2 \%$ of them were used more than 10 times: a level potentiall leading to incidental vocabulary learning (Webb, 2007). These findings supported the potential pedagogical value of TED talks for ESP instruction.

However, further explorations are till needed to establish how and how much TED talks and TED-Ed animations willhelp students learn various other kinds of disciplinary English. As both these discourse types have been used extensively for science popularization, the present study's lexical exploration of their sutaility as resources for EST instruction targeted talks and animations on science and technology themes. More specificall, it measured their respective coverage of specialized vocabulary (i.e., the HswL and EAP SL vocabulary) and compared it with that fscience lectures. As important as it i to idetify such coverage as part of an asesment of the two TED discourse types suitability for ES instructio, however, it is als esential to identify how many distinct ocabulary items on the specialized is actually make up the coverage. This study thus further identified the number of distinct HsWL and EAP SL vocabulary items occurring and their repeate occurrence in science and technology TED talks and TED-Ed animations in comparison with those in science lectres. I is hoped that these explorations wil erich the range of potential ET teaching and learning resources.

To investigate the extent to which science and technology TED talks and TED-Ed animations are similar to or different from science lectures in terms of specialized vocabulary, a lexical approach was taken to answer the following research questions:

1. How much coverage does the HSWL provide in three corpora: a science and technology TED talks, b) science and technology TED. Ed animations, and c) science lectures?   
2. How many word families from the HswL occur in the same three corpora, and how often are they encountered in each corpus?   
3. How much coverage does the EAP SL provide in three corpora: a) science and technology TED talks, b) science and technology TED. Ed animations, and c) science lectures?   
4. How many word familie from the EAP SL occur in the same three corpora, and how often are they encountered in each corpus?

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. The corpora

To examine the presence of specialized vocabulary in science and technology TED talks and TED-Ed animations, and whether they are comparable with science lectures in that respect, threecorpora were constructed, respectively representing science and technology TED talks, cience and technology TED-Ed animations, and science lectures. The selection of TED tals and TED-Ed animations to form these corpora was mainly based on two factors, 1) their topical association with science and technology and 2) their popularity. In terms of topic, the categorization of the TED website was the main means of identification. Specificall, for TED talks, the TED Talks website's filter function was employed to identify alltalkscategorized as Science and Technology, which collectively cover numerous sub-topics such as biology, chemistry, and computer science. For TED-Ed animations, the filter function of the TED-Ed website was likewise used to identify those animations categorized as Science & Technology, which consists of five subcategories: Earth and Space Science, Life Sciences, Physical Science, Enviromental Science, and Nature of Science. The popularity of the reulting pool of videos and animations was then taken into account, as it 1) is a common criterion for users' selection of videos for viewing, and 2) may to some extent reflect the importance of the ssue that the videos deal with and/or the general interest of the public in it.

Using these two criteria, the top 100 TED talks and top 100 TED-Ed animations associated with science and technology were identified and their transcripts were gathered to respectively construct the science and technology TED talks corpus (S&T ED) and the science and technology TED-Ed animations corpus (S&T TED-Ed). S&T TED consisted of 238,791 tokens, and the average duration of its talks was about $1 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ . S&T TED-Ed members' token count was 69,197, and their average duration was around $5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$

The science lectures (SL) corpus was constructed of lectures extracted from the British Academic Spoken English (BASE) corpus, which is made up of 160 lectures and 40 seminars from four disciplinary groups, i.e, the life and medical sciences, physical sciences, social studies/social sciences, and arts and humanities. The lectures from the first two of these groups were demed most appropriate for the current analys, in light f it target of ES instruction. Accordingly, al 80 lectures belonging to those two field of the BASE corpus were collected, and found to have a total word count of 583,434.

# 3.2. Data analysis

To answer the current research questions, the Lexical Frequency Profiling method (Laufer & Nation, 1995) was employed. As mentioned previously, this method allows the researcher to identify the vocabulary load of or examine the extent of occurrence of specialized vocabulary in a text or group of similar texts using corpus analysis tool. AntWordProfiler 2.0.1 (Anthony, 2022), a tool widely used in lexical coverage studies, was employed for this purpose. When selected word lists and a corpus to be analyzed are loaded onto the ool, it generates the coverage of the former vis-a-vis the ltter identifies the incidence f headwords, and counts such words.

Our first word ist, the HsWL, was developed based on a corpus of spoken hard-science texts to capture the words that are used most frequently in spoken hard science, including those that are high frequency in general but also have specialized meanings. ur second, the EAP sL, was created based on written academic texts from acros multiple subject areas in the hard sciences. As it only encompases words that are outside the high-frequency general word families and core academic words, it can help provide further information regarding the lexical diffrences between the corpora. It should be noted that the HSWL and the EAP SL were developed based on different approaches influenced by diffring views of the role of general word is in the creation of pecialized ones. However, both approaches have their merits; there is no agreed-upon best one for this purpose, and both the resulting lists can be considered useful to the present paper's analyses.

Analyses of the presence in the three corpora of lexical items from different HswL-level lists were also conducted to more thor. oughly explore the corpora's vocabulary make-up. More specificall, the coverage, the number of word families and the number of repeated encounters of HswL were computed separately for levels 1 and 2, on the one hand, and on the other, levels 3 and 4. The reason for this grouping was that levels1 and 2 of the HW capture the word families that are frequent in hard-science speech and that are also within the most frequent 2,00 general word families. Levels 3 and 4 of the HswL, on the other hand, comprise word families frequently used in hard-science speech but outside the high-frequency general vocabulary bands. In other words, HswL levels 1 and 2 can be considered higher-frequency HSWL items, and levels 3 and 4 lower-frequency ones, following Liu (2023b).

Lexical coverage analysis should address variation among texts within a corpus (Webb, 2021). To achieve this, the transcripts making up the current study's three corpora were analyzed individually. Each transcript was then loaded onto the AntWordProfiler tool for analysis of its coverage of the HSWL as a whole, HSWL levels 1 and 2, HSWL levels 3 and 4, and the EAP $\mathbf { S L } ,$ as well as the presence of distinct leical items in it. The means of ll the obtained results were then computed, and the numbers of lexical items totaled, to facilitate comparison across the three corpora.

This study also explored the extent to which science and technology TED talks and TED-Ed animations differed from science lectures in terms of their use of pecialized vocabulary. Kruskal-Walli tests were performed to explore whether the coverage levels of specialized vocabulary defined by the EAP SL and the HswL's levels 1-4, levels 1-2, and lels 3-4 differed significantly across the three corpora, as the following assumptions were met: (1) the dependent variable (coverage level) is continuous; (2) the independent variable consists of two or more categorical groups (science lectures, science and technology TED talks, and science and technology TED-Ed animations); 3) the observations are independent (there i no relationship between the transcripts in the three corpora); (4) the observations are not normally distributed. To determine whether there were significant differences between the corpora, pairwise comparisons via Dunn tests were performed, with a Bonferroni adjustment applied to set the significance level at $p < 0 . 0 1 6 7$ (0.05/3) for ll comparisons. ote that the means, instead of the medians, were reported as the distributions of the coverage results in the three corpora have diferent shapes (as showed in Figs. 1 and 3 in section 4). One-way ANOVA tests were also conducted to establish whether the number of specialized word families were statisticall different across the three corpora, and pairwise post-hoc analyses were carried out to explore inter-corpora differences in the coverage and presence of HsWL and EAP SL word families.

# 4. Results

# 4.1. HswL coverage of the three corpora

Table 1 presents the mean coverage provided by HswL levels 1-4, 1-2, and 3-4 in each of the three corpora, and Fig. 1 shows the distributions of such coverage.

In terms of overall HSWL coverage, the S&T TED corpus $\left( 8 6 . 5 \% \right)$ was more comparable to the SL corpus $( 8 4 . 8 \% )$ than the S&T TEDEd corpus was $( 8 0 . 8 \% )$ . This can also be observed in Fig. 1, in which the coverage distributions of both the S&T TED and SL corpora skew to the lft while that of the S&T TED-Ed corpus skews to the right In overall HSWL pread, the S&T TED talks and cience lectures were quite similar, with most results clustering around $8 0 { - } 9 0 \%$ HSWL coverage. Most of the S&T TED-Ed animations, in contrast, clustered around $7 5 \mathrm { - } 8 5 \%$ HSWL coverage, echoing that their mean HswL coverage was slightly lower than those of the other two corpora.

A similar tendency was also observed among the mean HSwL level 1-2 coverage in the three corpora, with a left-skewed distri bution observed in both the S&T TED and SL ones. However, most of the relevant results for S&T TED clustered around $8 0 { - } 9 0 \%$ whereas in SL, the parallel figure was $7 5 \mathrm { - } 8 5 \%$ . Again, S&T TED-Ed had a relatively lower mean for HSwL level 1-2 coverage than either of the other two corpora, clustering around $7 0 { - } 7 5 \%$

Turning now to the lower-frequency HSWL items, S&T TED-Ed had a coverage of HSWL levels 3-4 $( 4 . 1 \% )$ very similar to SL $( 3 . 9 \% )$ and much higher than S&T TED $( 2 . 4 \% )$ . As can be seen in Fig. 1, the shape of the distribution of HswL level 3-4 results across the S&T TED-Ed and SL corpora was aso similar, whereas most of the parall S&T TED corpus results clustered around the left end: reflecting that, in comparison with the content of the other two corpora, many fewer talks achieved a coverage of more than $5 \%$

Kruskal-Wallis tsts were run to measure whether the thre corpora differed at significant levels in terms of their HswL level 1-4, HSWL level 1-2, and/or HswL level 3-4 coverage, and Dunn post-hoc tests were conducted for pairwise comparisons. Regarding overall HsWL coverage, this showed that the three corpora were significantly different at the $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ level [chi-square $= 7 7 . 4 6$ $p <$ 0.001]. Post-hoc analysis further showed pairwise diferences among the three corpora, indicating that S&T TED had significantly higher HSWL coverage $\mathbf { \langle M = 8 6 . 5 3 }$ $\mathrm { S D } = 3 . 2 9 $ ) than both SL $( \mathbf { M } = 8 4 . 0 5 $ $\mathrm { S D } = 3 . 5 9 $ ) and S&T TED-Ed $\mathbf { M } = 8 1 . 0$ $S \mathrm { D } = 4 . 5 3 $ , and that S&T TED-Ed had a significantly lower HsWL coverage than the other two corpora. There were very similar Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn results for coverage of HswL levels 1-2 [chi-square $= 1 1 7 . 3 7$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ]$ , with S&T TED having significantly higher coverage $\mathbf { ( M = }$ 84.15, $\mathrm { S D } = 3 . 3 8 )$ than SL $( \mathbf { M } = 8 0 . 8 5 $ $\mathrm { S D } = 3 . 4 3 \mathrm { \Omega }$ and S&T TED-Ed $( \mathbf { M } = 7 6 . 9 0$ $\mathrm { S D } = 4 . 2 4 )$ , and S&T TED-Ed having a significantly lower coverage than the other two corpora. Yet, while a sinificant difference in HswL lel 3-4 coverage among the three corpora was identified by Kruskal-Wallis test [chi-square $= 7 1 . 2 7 $ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ]$ , Dunn post-hoc analysis indicated no significant difference between SL $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 9 3$ $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 6 2 ) $ and S&T TED-Ed $( \mathbf { M } = 4 . 0 6$ $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 6 1 $ , while S&T TED in fact had significantly lower HSwL level 3-4 coverage than the other two $( \mathbf { M } = 2 . 3 9$ $\mathrm { S D } = 1 . 0 6 $

# 4.2. The HswL word families in the three corpora

This study's investigation of the number of distinct HSWL word families occurring in the thre corpora and how often these items were encountered established that an overwhelmingly majorit of HsWL word families occurred in the three corpora, with 1,553 $( 9 7 . 4 \% )$ in S&T TED, 1,448 $( 9 0 . 8 \% )$ in S&T TED-Ed, and 1,586 $( 9 9 . 4 \% )$ in SL. Of these families, 1,430 of them were shared across all three corpora. A full list of the shared items can be found in Appendix I.

To further explore how many HSwL word families a learner would be likely to encounter across the three types of discourse represented by the three corpora, the author identified the number of HswL word familiesoccurring in the individual texts of each corpus and how often they were repeated. Table 2 summarizes the mean number of word families from HSwL levels 1-4, HSwL levels 1-2, and HswL levels 3-4 that occurred in each corpus.

As can be seem from Table 2, rrespective of HswL levels, largr numbers of different Hsw word families .., a grater variet of such families - occurred in SL than in the other two corpora; and S&T TED had a higher number of different HSWL word families than S&T TED-Ed did. On average, in the same thre corpora respectively, alearner would encounter 534, 371, and 205 different HSWL word families; 468, 341, and 188 different HSWL level1-2 word families; and 68, 30, and 18 different HSWL level 3-4 word families.

A learner might only encounter a smallnumber of dfferent HswL items when viewing a science/technology TED talk or TED-Ed animation. However, if they viewed allof the 100 most popular such TED talks, the number of HswL word families they would encounter would increase from 371 items $( 2 3 . 3 \% )$ to 1,553 items $( 9 7 . 4 \% )$ . The parallel increase in the case of the top 100 science/ technology TED-Ed animations would be from 205 items $( 1 2 . 9 \% )$ to 1,448 items $( 9 0 . 8 \% )$ . This suggests that regular viewing of TED talks and TED-Ed animations on science/technology topic could provide rich opportunities for students to encounter a wide range of HSWL items.

Three ANOVAs were run to measure whether the three corpora differed at significant levels in terms of their numbers of Hsw level 1-4, HSWL level 1-2, and/or HswL level 3-4 word families. As the assumption of equal variance was not met in any of those three cases, the Welch and Brown Forsythe tests were employed. Both tests results were statisticall significant, so only the results of the Welch test are reported below. With regard to the first, this showed that the threecorpora were significantly different at the $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ level $[ \mathrm { F } ( 2 , 2 7 7 ) = 4 5 1 . 7 8 ,$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ]$ . Dunnett's T3 post-hoc analysis confirmed the existence of pairwise differences, with SL having a significantly higher number of different HswL word families ( $\mathbf { \Delta M } = 5 3 5 . 7 1$ $\mathrm { S D } = 9 5 . 8 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ than either S&T TED $\mathbf { M } = 3 7 1 . 2 5$ $\mathrm { S D } = 8 5 . 0 5$ or S&T TED-Ed $( \mathbf { M } = 2 0 5 . 4 9$ $\mathrm { { S D } } = 2 2 . 5 9 $ , while S&T TED-Ed had a significantly lower number of different HSWL word families than the other two corpora.

The ANOVA and Dunnett's T3 analyses for HSwL levels 1 $- 2 \ [ \mathrm { F } ( 2 , 2 7 7 ) = 4 3 9 . 3 9$ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ]$ and 3-4 $\operatorname { \mathbb { I F } } ( 2 , 2 7 7 ) = 2 8 8 . 3 8$ $\boldsymbol { \mathsf { p } } <$ 0.001] were broadly similar: with SL having a significantly higher number of HsWL level 1-2 word families $( \mathbf { M } = 4 6 7 . 6 9$ $\mathrm { S D } = 8 0 . 6 2 $ and HSwL level 3-4 word families $( \mathbf { M } = 6 8 . 0 3 $ $\mathrm { S D } = 2 0 . 9 9 \mathrm { \Omega }$ than either S&T TED $( \mathbf { M } = 3 4 0 . 8 3$ $\mathrm { S D } = 7 5 . 3 1 $ $\mathbf { M } = 3 0 . 4 2$ $\mathrm { S D } = 1 3 . 8 3 )$ or S&T TED-Ed $( \mathbf { M } = 1 8 7 . 9$ $\mathrm { S D } = 1 9 . 6 6$ $\mathbf { M } = 1 7 . 5 9$ $\mathrm { S D } = 5 . 8 6 \AA$ . Also, S&T TED-Ed had significantly lower numbers of HswL level 1-2 and level 3-4 word families than the other two corpora did.

Next, following Dang (2020), the HswL word families occurring in the three corpora were categorized into five frequency bands representing the number of encounters with them: .e., one to four, five to nine, 10 to 14, 15 to 19, and 20 or more encounters (Fig. 2) As can be seen from Fig. 2, despite inter-corpus differences in the number of distinct HSWL word families, the distribution of word families among the different frequency bands in S&T TED was more simila to that of SL than that of S&T TED-Ed. Most of the former two corpora's results clustered on the right, whereas the latter's were more evenly distributed across the frequency bands.

Fig. 2. Frequencies of Hard Science Spoken Word List word families occurring in the three corpora.

As suggested by previous studies (e.g., Webb, 2007), incidental learning of a new word's form-meaning connection can happen over the course of as few as 10 encounters. In the present case, the number of HswL word families that could be encountered 10 times or more was represented $5 2 . 9 \%$ of S&T TED-Ed $\mathbf { ( n = 7 6 3 ) }$ $7 8 . 2 \%$ of S&T TED $( \mathtt { n } = 1 , 2 1 4 )$ and $9 0 . 7 \%$ of SL $( \mathtt { n } = 1 , 4 3 9$ items).

Similar tendencies were also found in the proportions of HswL level 1-2 and level 3-4 word families occurring $^ { 1 0 + }$ times in the three corpora: with a higher proportion of both bands occurring in SL (1-2: $9 3 . 2 \%$ $\mathtt { n } = 1 , 0 6 4$ ; 3-4: $8 4 . 5 \%$ $\mathtt { n } = 3 7 5$ ) and S&T TED (1-2: $8 9 . 6 \%$ $\mathbf { n } = 1 , 0 2 2$ ; 3-4: $4 6 . 5 \%$ $\begin{array} { r }  \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 1 9 2 \boldsymbol  \mathrm  \ \end{array}$ ) than in S&T TED-Ed (1-2: $6 1 . 5 \%$ $\mathtt { n } = 6 8 0$ ; 3-4, $2 4 . 3 \%$ $\mathbf { n } = 8 3$

# 4.3. EAP SL coverage across the three corpora

Table 3 presents the mean EAP SL coverage levels of the three corpora, and Fig. 3, the distrbution of such coverage levels of their individual transcripts.

The S&T TED-Ed corpus had double the EAP SL coverage of its SL counterpart $( 3 . 4 \%$ vs. $1 . 7 \%$ , which in turn had double that of S&T TED ( $3 . 7 \%$ vs. $0 . 8 \%$ . As can be observed from Fig. 3, there was little variation among the S&T TED results, with the vast majority clustering around $0 { - } 2 \%$ EAP SL coverage. The distributions of the results were more similar between S&T TED and SL than between S&T TED-Ed and SL, with both S&T TED and SL skewing to the right. Larger variation was observed acrossthe results in the S&T TED.

To further explore how the three corpora differed in EAP SL coverage levels, a Kruskal-Walls test was conducted. The result chisquare $= 9 0 . 5 3 $ $p < 0 . 0 0 1 ]$ identified significant inter-corpus differences at the $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ level. Dunn post-hoc tests' pairwise comparisons then showed that the TED-Ed animations had significantly higher EAP SL coverage $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 3 6$ $\mathrm { S D } = 2 . 6 6 $ than the science lectures ( $\mathrm { { M } } = 1 . 7 1$ $\mathrm { { \cal S D } } = 1 . 7 2 \mathrm { { \Omega } }$ , and that the EAP SL coverage of the TED talks $( \mathbf { M } = 0 . 8 0$ $\mathrm { { S D } } = 0 . 7 2$ ) was significantly lower than those of either of the other genres.

# 4.4. EAP SL word families in the three corpora

Many more of the 318 EAP SL word families occurred in SL. $( 9 3 . 4 \%$ $\mathbf { n } = 2 9 7 $ ) than in S&T TED $( 7 6 . 1 \%$ ${ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } } = 2 4 2$ ) or S&T TED-Ed $( 7 1 . 7 \%$ $\begin{array} { r }  \bar { \bf n } = 2 2 8 \ \end{array}$ . All three corpora featured 187 of the same EAP SL word families. The fullist of these shared items can be found in Appendix II.

Table 4 summarizes the mean number of EAP SL word families occurring in each of the three focal discourse types.

On average, a learner would respectively encounter about 21.8, 9.9, and 9.5 EAP SL word families in a science lecture, a top 100 science/technology TED-Ed animation, and a top 100 science/technology TED talk. In other words, a markedly greater variety of EAP SL word families can be found in the SL corpus than in the other two. However, the number of the word families encountered would increase from 9.5 items $( 3 \% )$ to 242 $( 7 6 . 1 \% )$ if all of the top 100 TED talks were viewed, and from 9.9 items $( 3 . 1 \% )$ to 228 $( 7 1 . 7 \% )$ if all of the top 100 TED-Ed animations were viewed.

As the assumption of equal variance was not met by any of the three corpora, the test statistics employed for the AnoVA were Welch and Brown Forsythe tests. As both tests results were statisticall significant, only the results of the Welch tests are reported below. The results revealed that the three corpora differed significantly in EAP SL coverage at the $p < 0 . 0 1$ level $[ \mathrm { F } ( 2 , 2 7 7 ) = 4 1 . 6 3 6 , p$ $< 0 . 0 0 1 ]$ . Dunnett's T3 post-hoc analysis confirmed that SL had a significantly higher presence of different EAP SL word families $\mathbf { ( M = }$ 21.75, $\mathrm { S D } = 1 5 . 9 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ than either S&T TED $\mathbf { M } = 9 . 4 6$ $\mathrm { S D } = 6 . 8 2 $ ) or S&T TED-Ed ( $\mathbf { M } = 9 . 8 9$ $\mathrm { S D } = 5 . 4 8 $ ). However, it found no significant difference between S&T TED and S&T TED-Ed in this regard.

Next, the items occurring in the three corpora were categorized into five frequency bands based on the numbers of times one would ncounter them (Fig. 4).

As can been seen from Fig. 4, the distributions of the S&T TED and S&T TED-Ed results were quite similar, with their EAP SL word.

family coverage both skewing to the right. This indicates that the numbers of repeated encounters with most of the EAP SL word families occurring in these two corpora is rather small. In contrast, the distriution of AP L word famlies in the SL corpus resembles an inverted bell curve, with most results clustering at the ends. Lastly, it should be noted that much lower proportions and numbers of EAP SL word families occurred 10 or more times in S&T TED $( \mathtt { n } = 6 3$ $2 6 \%$ ) and S&T TED-Ed ${ \bf ( n = 6 2 }$ $2 7 . 2 \%$ ) than in SL $( \mathtt { n } = 1 5 6$ $5 2 . 5 \% )$

# 5. Discussion

The present study's comparison of science/technology TED talks, science/technology TED-Ed animations, and science lectures showed that the former featured rich coverage of HSWL ocabulary, and particularl, of those HSWL items that are also high frequency in general use. While the sampled TED-Ed animations had relatively les coverage of this higher-frequency HSWL vocabulary, they had very rich coverage both of HswL vocabulary that islessfrequently encountered in general English and of words frequently used in written science texts (i.e., the EAP SL items), in line with science lectures. Both TED discourse types had rather lower variety than science lectures. The TED talks featured a greater variety of HSWL items than the TED-Ed animations did, but these two discourse types' variety of EAP SL items was comparable.

Together, these results imply that science/technology TED talks are potentiall important resources in which students can encounter a large number and great variety of higher-frequency HswL items. Learners are likely to encounter a wider variet of lower. frequency HSWL items in TED talks than in TED-Ed animations, but these items seem to be encountered much more frequently in the latter discourse type. Given their rich representation of HswL items, but fr lower representation of the lower-frequency ones, TED talks may be primarily useful in helping students become familiar with higher-frequency HswL items. On the other hand, TED-Ed animations' relatively higher coverage of lower-frequency HswL items would tend to enable their viewers to encounter them frequently. Yet, considering their rather lower variet f HswL items, i is suggested that other resources, such as TED talks, may also be employed to give students opportunities to encounter a wider variety of the lower-frequency HSwL items. Moreover, despite a comparable variety of EAP SL items across the sampled TED tals and TED-Ed animations, the lattr had a much higher coverage of these items. It istherefore recommended that TED-Ed animations rather than TED talks be used to familiarize students with these words.

The mean HSwL coverage in the sampled TED talks, $8 6 . 5 \%$ , was slightly higher than the $8 6 . 1 \%$ cumulatively achieved by Vukovic-Stamatovic's (2022) sample of science and technology documentaries suggesting that the former can also be considered useful resources for EST instruction. Moreover, as compared to the EAP SL coverage of science fiction/fantasy stories $( 0 . 5 \% )$ (Rolls & Rodgers, 2017), and popular-science books $( 1 . 5 \% )$ (Vukovic-Stamatovic, 2020b), the sampled TED-Ed animations were much higher, at $3 . 4 \%$ , a coverage level comparable with that of written science texts $( 3 . 8 \% )$ (Coxhead & Hirsh, 2007). This not only indicates that TED-Ed animations can be considered useful resources for EST instruction, but further suggests that such animations could help to improve students' knowledge of written hard-science vocabulary. That is, when teaching written science vocabulary, teachers should not limit themselves to using written materials, as spoken ones may also be of help. This opens up new vistas in the selection of materials for EST vocabulary learning. While thre are likely to be differnces between materials written for reading vs. for speaking, e. , at the sentence level and/or the use of different lexical items as meta-iscourse strtgies, this finding points to the potential lexical similarity between traditional written genres and genres written to be spoken.

The observed variation in both the coverage and variety of HsWL and EAP SL items further highlighted important lexical differ ences between TED tals and TED-Ed animations, despite their shared topics and shared purpose. One reason for such variation may be their differing lels of pre-planning. lthough many speakers of TED talks ollow well-planed outlines or even memorize their scripts word-for-word, there is silla certain level f spontaneit n their delivery (Li & Chen, 2020). lso, TED tls ar dlivered in real time to live audiences, and those giving them may therefore tend to choose general words instead of infrequent or specialized ones, to enable the non-specialized audience ollow the content and better understand specialized concepts. Active avoidance of bombarding the audience with jargon can also be seen as a strategy for maintaining the audience's attention and interest.

![](img/aa85f8dd966be499b703d949e65398a6ba3c8e0e9e41a8cda53eea095d3e4485.jpg)  
Fig. 4. Frequencies of EAP SL word families occurring in the three corpora.

TED-Ed animations, on the other hand, are fullyscripted and written for speaking. As written texts usually contain many more infrequently encountered words than speech does, this could explain the sampled TED talks' much higher coverage of higher. frequency HSWL items than the TED-Ed animations. It can also be speculated that the animated nature of TED-Ed animations contributes to their relatively lower coverage of Hsw level 1-2 items. hat is in the presence of animated fotge, words that are used to describe, connect, and identify - which are primarily high-frequency general words - may not be needed as often. Thus, as HswL level 1-2 items include high-frequency general words, the animated nature of TED-Ed animations may explain why they had relatively low coverage of these higher-frequency items.

Other possible reasons for the observed variation may involve how focused a topic is and the length of the video. In a TED talk, the speaker has relatively ample time to ease the audience into the topic, introducing it at length, providing detailed descriptions, and elaborating it with supporting ids. Given the considerably shorter length of aTED-d anmation, it wil ncesarily be more topically restricte, to ensure that al the important information and key ideas can be condensed into a short video. Given this narrower focus, the lexical variety may be smaller, even as the lexical items closey relatd to the topic occur frquentl. ogther, these differences in topical characterisics and video length may explain the higher coverage of the lower-frequency HSWL and EAP SL items, and lower variety of lower-frequency HSWL items, in TED-Ed animations as compared to TED talks.

Although both TED talks and TED-Ed animations share the same goal - delivering knowledge to a non-specialized audience - their fundamental ifferences in terms of pre-planning/scriptednes, delivery mode, topical characterisics, and length may by themselves explain their divergent representation of specialized vocabulary. This study's insights into the lexical nature of TED talks and TED-Ed animations may enrich ongoing discussions of the differences between these two types of discourse (e.g., Liu, 2023c).

# 6. Pedagogical implications

Based on the current indings, science and technology TED talks and TED-Ed animations can be considered useful materil for EST instruction. Yet, given their different lexical natures, teachers should give careful consideration to precisely how they are employed. Specificall, the range of uses of the talks is likely to be more extensive than that of the animations. In particula, given their higher coverage and greater variety of higher-frequency HSWL items, science/technology TED talks could be used as bridging material to introduce vocabulary items that are frequent in general contexts as well as in hard-science speech to novice EST students. However, they can also provide students with some encounters with lower-frequency HswL items.

Animations' relatively higher coverage of the lower-frequency HswL items, on the other hand, means that they may be more suitable for students who have already mastered high-frequency general words and are seeking to become familiar with words that are infrequent in general use yet essential in hard-science speech. That being said, the animations lower variety of Hsw items means that they would have to be sulemented with other resources such as TED talks, to provide learners with rich opportunities to encounter a wide variety of HSWL items. Moreover, as TED-Ed animations appear to have much higher coverage of EAP SL items than TED talks do, they may be more suitable for familiarizing students with words frequently encountered in written hard-science discourse.

In practical terms, all f this means that EST teachers should consider their students current overallvocabulary knowledge when selecting suitable vocabulary learning material. Before showing TED talks or TED-Ed animations, teachers should provide scaffolding for certain vocabulary items that ae crucial to their topics and/or that they feel may be challenging for their students. They can also draw learners attention to some key words t help them make connections betwen their forms and pronunciations during viewing. In addition to using thee resources for listening activities, it has previously ben sugested that tachers make us f their transcripts as reading materials (Hu, 2020). In the case of TED talks, teachers could usefully direct their students' atention to certain features of speech or presentation strategies, such as how speakers focus the audience's attention and how they make transitions between ideas This would not only tend to facilitate students comprehension of the content, but also to improve their presentation skill. Moreover, as briefly noted above, a word on a specialized word it may expres general, academic, and specialized meanings in specialized texts. It i therefore recommended that teachers also pay special attention to those words with variant meanings and provide proper scaffolding for them before assigning talks or animations for viewing. Such an approach would likely improve students' academic/specialized vocabulary knowledge while also reducing their listening-comprehension burden.

# 7. Conclusion

Taken together, this exploratory study's findings suggest that both TED talks and TED-Ed animations on science/technology topics can serve as useful materials for EST students with varied vocabulary levels and learning purposes. They also have revealed critical differences between TED talks and TED-Ed animations from a lexical perspectie, as well as their similarities to and differences from science lectures. The pedagogical implications of the results have also been highlighted for those teachers who may wish to integrate such resources into EST instruction. However, this study has several limitations that should be acknowledged. First, it should be noted that as the current orpora were rather retricted in size, the current indings and the implications drawn from them should be treated with caution, and may or may not reflct the overall state f all TED talks and TED-Ed animations, even within the science/technology sphere. Second, it should be borne in mind that this study only examined the specialized vocabulary in the top 100 science and technology TED talks and TED-Ed animations. Larger and more extensive corpora willbe needed if we are to arrive at a deeper understanding of the lexical nature of these discourse types. Third, this study only explored whether TED talks and TED-Ed animations might be helpful materials for EST instruction from a lexical coverage perspective. However, there are many other factors that should be examined if we are to arive at a rounded understanding of such helpfulnes, including but not limited to their speech rates and lexical density (Wingrove, 2017). Future research should therefore look into TED talks and TED-Ed animations from perspectives other than vocabulary. Fourth, empirical studies are needed to explore whether EST students knowledge of specialized vocabulary can be improved through viewing relevant TED talks and/or TED-Ed animations. Qualitative approaches, such as interviews, could also enrich our understanding of potential dificulties that students may encounter during viewing. Such information would help EST teachers make better use of these resources and thus expand their value for EST instruction. Lastly, this study simply examined the coverage of specialized word lists, without considering whether individual words in its three corpora express general, academic, or specialized meanings. Future studies could therefore usefully explore variation in the meanings of specialized words in specialized contexts, as Gardner (2007) recommended. Also, this study utilized word lists that employed word familie rather than word lemmas as the units of ountin for aessing the specilized vocabulary coverage inthe current corpora. Word families reat words with the same spelling as identical, even though their meanings can vary based on their parts of speech. This choice of units for counting could potentially inluence the outcomes of lexical coverage analysis. Future studie re therefore recommended to employ word lemmas as counting units for such analysis, as also suggested by Skoufaki and Petric (2021), and Ward and Chuenjundaeng (2009).
