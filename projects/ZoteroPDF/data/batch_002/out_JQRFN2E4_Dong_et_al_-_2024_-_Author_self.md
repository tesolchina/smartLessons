This study explored the use of author self-reference from cross-linguistic/cultural and crossdisciplinary perspectives in research articles (RAs). Based on a self-built corpus consisting of two disciplines (Computer Science and Linguistics) and two languages (Chinese and English), this study extracted the self-reference markers and compared their uses across the linguistic/cultural and disciplinary corpora. The cross-linguistic/cultural analysis showed that English RAs contain a higher frequency of first-person pronouns, while Chinese RAs tend to utilize more inanimate NPs in both disciplines. The cross-disciplinary comparison identified that English Computer Science texts are characterized by a more explicit authorial persona, while Chinese RAs display a mitigated authorial presence in the text construction. The findings contribute to our knowledge of how the specific disciplinary community and cultural conventions influence writers' manifestation of their authorial presence.

# 1. Introduction

Authorial identity encapsulates the manner in which writers conceptualize and project themselves s authors within the framework f their writen work (Ivanic, 1998).As an interal fact of rhtorical trategy (Azar & Hashim, 2022), authorial idtity plas a ivotal role in shaping the stylistic and persuasive dimensions of academic discourse (Hyland, 2001; Lancaster, 2016; Tang & John, 199) Self-reference constitutes a key linguistic resource that allows writers to construct an authoritative and credible identity within a disciplinary community (Mur Duenas, 2007). According to Kuo (1999), the strategic use f self-reference enables writers to sert thir expertise, emphasize their contributions to the field, and seek recognition of their work.

Substantial attention has been attracted to the investigation of elf-reference acros a range of linguistic and cultural contexts. This exploration extends beyond English research articles (RAs) to encompass RAs in other languages, including Bulgarian, French, German, Itian, Rssin, and Spanish, among thers. Previous reeach has identified ntable differences in the use f slf-reference for the establishment of authorial identity within the realm of academic writing. These diferences underscore the impact of sociocultural norms, values, and expectations on the discourse of academia within diverse cultural contexts (e.g., Dong & Buckingham, 2018; Isik-Tas, 2018; Le, 2007; Lores-Sanz, 2011; Molino, 2010; Mur Duenas, 2007; Vassileva, 2000). The integration of disciplinary perspectives has the potential to enhance this field, particularly by facilitating a more comprehensive examination of linguistic, cultural, and disciplinary onventions, as wellas the inricat interplay of various inluential factors, including the dynamics between discipline and culture.

Research pertaining to variations in authors' utilization of selfreference within distinct disciplinary communities has gained increasing attention in recent decades (e.g., Dong & Buckingham, 2020; Harwo0d, 2005a, 2005b; Lee, 2013; Milan, 2010). According to Hyland (2001, 2002), the use of self-reference is notably related to the social and epistemological practices characterizing each academic discipline. In this study, we compared the use of self-reference in the Computer Science and Linguistics disciplines for the following reasons. Firs, these two disciplines focus on the generation and interpretation of information, yet they manifes these fundamental processes in distinct ways. Computer Science is concerned with data processing through the prism of algorithms and programming languages (Knuth, 1974), while Linguistics centers its inquiries on the analysis of language structure and semantic meaning (Chomsky, 2009; Quine, 2013; Saussure, 2011). In the contemporary landscape, Computer Scienceassumes a pivotal role in the perpetuation of societal competitiveness, inovation, and progress, while Lingustics remains instrumental to the study of the cultural underpinnings of civilizations and human communication (Sapir, 1929). Furthermore, the combination of Computer Science and Linguistics not only led to the development of the Computational Linguisics discipline (Mitkov, 2022; Roland, 2001) but has also contributed to areas like Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. Thus, a comparative investigation can elucidate the discipline-specificattributes and conventions characterizing research texts within these two domains. It also serves to identify variations in the rhetorical strategies employed by authors from these disciplines when presenting their scholarly personas. Such analyses are of importance to researchers aiming to engage in interdisciplinary collaboration between the spheres of Computer Science and Linguisics, as they contribute to our understanding of how knowledge is diffrently constructed and communicated in each discipline (Dong & Buckingham, 2023).

# 2. Writer identity and self-reference

# 2.1. Studies on self-reference and academic writer identity

The construction of authorship in academic research texts needs to be crafted in a manner that i recognized as appropriate and credible by the targeted disciplinary readership (Harwood, 2005a; Hyland, 2001, 2002; Ivanic & Camps, 2001). By projecting a persona imbued with inherent authority, authors are able to substantiate their credibility, exhibit nuanced confidence in their assessments, and atrat and sustain the engagement of their readership. Self-reference is an essential rhetorical linguistic too in the construction of authorial identity, as it enables writers to project their authorial self into the text, and establish an authoritative presence i relation to the subject matter, and engage with therespective disciplinary communit (Sheldon, 2009). By exercising their authorial elf authors showcase their expertise and tenure within a particular field and the practice is often recognized as a pivotal component of accomplished academic writing (Hyland, 2002).

Among the selfreference markers, the first-person pronoun is widely acknowledged as the foremost embodiment of authorial presence (Hyland, 202) and its deployment has atracted growing attention (e.g., Dong & Buckingham, 2022; McGrath, 2016; Tang & John, 1999; Candarli et al., 2015). The first-person pronoun is perceived as "a significant means of promoting a competent scholarly identity and gaining acceptance for one's idea" (Hyland, 2002, p. 110); se also Ivanic (1998). In addition to personal pronouns, research exploring Noun Phrases (NPs) associated with the author(s) or their respective works, such as the author(s), the researcher(s), this article(s), and this paper, has also emerged as a notable avenue of scholarly inquiry (Lee, 2013; Wu & Zhu, 2014; Yasmin & Mahmood, 2017). For instance, Wu and Zhu (2014) conducted an in-depth analysi of first-person pronouns and third-person NPs, such as  (the researcher) and (the author), in a cros-cultural examination of self-reference practices within English and Chinese research articles. Their findings showed that Chinese RA authors prefer to use third-person NPs more frequently than their English counterpart. Similarly, Yasmin and Mahmood (2017) examined the frequency and the discursive roles of NPs, including the writer and the author, alongside irs-person pronouns within RAs in the domains of English and Psychology. Their analysis found that authors in English exhibit a greater degree of confidence and assertivenes, as indicated by their extensive utilization of self-reference devices when compared to their counterparts in Psychology. In comparison to personal pronouns, the utilization of third-person NPs and inanimate NPs contributes to the impression of a more objective and detached style, thereby indicating a reduced degree of authorial intrusion (Chen, 2020; Molino, 2010). In light of these findings, a study examining both personal pronouns and NPs can provide comprehensive insights into the extent to which writers projectthemselves into the text and construct relationships with their readers.

# 2.2. Cross-disciplinary studies on self-reference

A growing number of studies have examined self-mention expressions from a cros-disciplinary perspective (e.g., Harwood, 2005a, 2005b; Lee, 2013; Millan, 2010). For instance, Khedri (2016) examined the use of first-person pronouns acros four disciplines and found that they appeared more ften in sot disciplines (Applied Linguistics and Psychology) than in hard disciplines (Environmental Engineering and Chemistry) Likwise Lee (2013) examined the use of elf-mention acros three disciplines (Litrature, ducation, and Chemistry), and found that depersonalized phrases were more frequently used in Chemistry than in the other two disciplines. These cross-disciplinary examinations have undercored the sustantial diferences that exist in the strategies employed by authors to project their presence through self-referential devices within varying knowledge-producing communities.

Previous research has also investigated the use of self-reference in Linguistics and Computer Science separately (see for instance, Linguistics: Rongen Breivega et al, 2002; Vassleva, 2000 and Computer Science: Cheung & Lau, 2020; Harwo0d, 2005a, 2005b). Gao (2017) compared the use of self-reference across Computer Science and Linguistics based on a corpus consisting of four disciplines (Physics, Computer Science, Linguistics, and Management). The results showed that Computer Science RAs contained more selfreference than Linguistics. However, to the best of our knowledge, progressin this line of comparative inquiry into these two disciplines is sill imited, and further exploration is neded to idenify more nuanced istinctions in how dicilinary writers manifest themselves in their authored texts in these two field. Such effort could further shed light on the underlying epistemological assumptions that shape these isciplinary practices and facilitate cross-disciplinary comprehension and collaboration betwen these two fields (Dong & Buckingham, 2023).

# 2.3. Cross-linguistic/cultural studies on self-reference

Numerous studies have explored the practice of self-reference in RAs across various writing cultures and languages, focusing particularly on comparisons between English and other languages (e.g., Lores-Sanz, 2011; Molino, 2010; Yakhontova, 2006). For example, Molino (2010) investigated the personal and impersonal authorial references in RAs within the fields of Linguistics written in both English and Italian. The results revealed a preference among English writers for an interpersonal strategy, characterized by the frequent use of first-person pronouns. In contrast, Italian-language writers employed a more detached style, often opting for passive sentence constructios. Similarly, Lores-Sanz (2011) examined the use first-person pronouns in RAs written in English and Spanish within the field of Business Management. The findings showed that English RAs contained a higher frequency of first-peron pronouns when compared to Spanish RAs authored by Spanish writers.

These studies have highlighted significant cultural differences between English and other languages, including Spanish, German, French, Russian, Norwegian, and Japanese (e.g., Breivega et al., 2002; Flottum, 2003; Mur Duenas, 2007; Vassileva, 2000). For instance, Mur Duenas (007) observed that scholars in the American-based Business Management community within the intenational context, tend to express a more distinct authorial identity through increased self-reference when compared with their Spanish counterparts in the national Spanish community. Vassileva (2000) discovered that English RAs displayed a prominent authorial presence frequently using I and we, i contrast to RAs in German, French, Russian, and Bulgarin Similarly, Yakhontova (2006) noted that English abstracts often adopt a personalized presentation style by employing the pronoun we to represent authors persona, while Slavic-language abstracts exhibit a stronger inclination towards depersonalization, avoiding personal pronouns entirely.

In the domain of cross-cultural and crosslinguistic research, significant attention has been devoted to the examination of RAs in both Chinese and English. Previous research has revealed inconsistent result in terms of the use of self-rference in these two languages. For instance, Mu et al. (2015) compared the usage of metadiscourse in English and in Chinese RAs published within the field of Applied Linguistics and found that Chinese RAs exhibited a greater inclination to employ self-mention markers as a means of estalishing an authorial presence in contrast to English RAs. In contrast, Lee (2013) compared self-rference practice in RAs across three different fields (Literature, Education, and Chemistry) and found that English RAs were more inclined to use irs-person pronouns while Chinese RAs demonstrated a stronger inclination to employ depersonalized NPs. However, Kim and Lim's (2013) investigation into metadiscourse in 40 research article introductions in the field of Educational Psychology found no discernble differences in the frequency of self-mention markers betwen English and Chinese RAs. These inconsistent findings signal that further research is needed to identify the nuances involved in the use of self-reference in Chinese and English.

The variations in the use of slf-reference in Chinese and English academic writing may pose challenges for writers who need to write in both languages (e.g., Kim & Lim, 2013; Lee, 2013; Mu et al., 2015). According to Sheldon (2009), L2 scholars face a greater risk of encountering challnges such as reduced interest in and diminished appreciation of their work (Dusak, 1994), as they are often influenced by the rhetorical conventions of their frst language when composing RAs. In addition, current Chinee government policies encourage English-medium publications as these contribute to improving universities' international status. At the same time, the authorities aso appeal toscholars to publish in Chinese as a measure to preserve the academic register of the language, and thus many scholars who earned their PhDs overseas shif to writing in Chinese (Liu & Buckingham, 2022; Zheng & Guo, 2019). In this context, the findings from mpirical rearch onthe differences in authorial elf-representation in Chinese and English acadmic writig can assist bilingual scholars in adjusting to the conventions in each language.

With this objective, this study examines the writer's use of self-reference in Chinese and English RAs in the fields of Linguistics an Computer Science. Specifically, we aim to address the following research questions.

1) What are the differences and similarities in the use of self-reference in Chinese and English RAs?   
2) What are the diferences and similarities in the use of self-reference in Linguistics and Computer Science RAs?

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. The corpus

The corpus comprises 600 RAs carefuly selcted from prominent journals in the felds of Linguistics and Computer Science, written in both Chinese and English. The processof journal selection involved consultation with domain-specific researchers, including three experts in Computer Science and three experts in Linguistics. These experts possess extensive experience in publishing research in Chinese and English. The chosen journals for the corpus are either indexed in well-established databases such as the Social Science Citation Index (sscI), Science Citation Index (SCI), and the Chinese Social Science Citation Index (cssci), or they are key journals approved by the China Computer Federation (CCF). According to our expert informants, these journals enjoy a broad readership among scholars in their respective fields and feature high-qualit reearch contributions from both domestic Chinese and international academic communities. The academic writing conventions in these journals can thus be considered to be representative of high quality language-specific reearch publications in these disciplines. The journals selected in this study are presented in the appendix. Based on these journals, we constructed four different corpora, namely Chinese-Computer (C-Com), Chinese-Linguistics (C-Lin), EnglishComputer (E-Com), and English-Linguistics (E-Lin), each of which comprises 150 RAs chosen from ten discipline-specific journals published from 2000 to 2020. We fllowed previous practice (e.g., Gong et al., 2021; Hu & Wang, 2014; Mur Duenas, 2007) and only included empirical research articles. Tables and references were not included in the selected samples. Table 1 provides general information about the four corpora created and scrutinized in this study.

# 3.2. Self-reference framework

This study is underpinned by the framework adapted from Chen (2020) and consists of thre categories, namely (1) first-person pronouns, (2) third-person NPs, and (3) inanimate NPs. To ensure the selection of specific search critria tailored to the corpora under investigation, we took into account both disciplinary considerations (Computer Science and Linguistics) and inguistic/cultural variations (Chinese and English) when determining the detailed linguistic markers within each category. When identifying the specific self-reference markers, we followed the approach employed by Hu and Cao (2015) in their identification of metadiscourse markers. We first incorporated a list of elf-reerence marker from previous studies on Chinese and English RAs (Chen, 2020; Le, 2013; Wu & Zhu, 2014). Subsequently, the first author and a trained researcher independently reviewed $1 0 \%$ of the data (60 RAs) and identified additional self-reference markers to complement the existing list Each marker was assigned a rating of indicating no agrement) or 1 (indicatig agrement) to establish its status as a self-reference marker. To ensure the consistency of this classfication, we employed Cohen's kappa coeficient, which yielded a value of 0.92, signifying a high levelof agreement in the categorization. The disagreements were resolved through discusion. Subsequently, the compiled search list was applied to the entire corpus. A detailed account of the framework and the examples adopted from the corpora examined in this study are presented as follows.

\*Due to space constraints, the complete lists of Chinese and English self-reference identified in our data are not provided in Table 2. In this study, the first-person pronouns examined include , me, we, us, our, my and their Chinese counterparts (I and me), (we and us), (my) and# o). According t Hyland (2005), the inclusive use f we serve  function related to reader engagement rather thn self-rerce. onuey, in this std, ery instn was sctin in its sfic cont  ure tht th were the exclusive we, whileal forms f w, us and our,  reerring  individl othr than the authors wr mte. s illustrated in Example (1), the authors utilize the exclusive we to represent their roles in interpreting results and findings, thereby expressing personal authority and conveying confidence in their arguments. As previously noted, the Chinese language lacks inflectional morphology that expresses case, gender, and number (Dowens et al., 2011). Plural personal pronouns are formed by appending the character  to the singular form, indicating a plurality, while possessive pronouns are created by adding \*' which carries a meaning akin to "of' or "s".

(1) We found that integrating CA was crucial to understanding proficiency efect on sequential organization of interaction, whicl speech act analyses cannot capture and which had so far not been shown for L2 request. (E-Lin)

Third-person NPs function as a more subtly veiled form of authorial slf-reference, concealing the genuine identity of the speaker, claimant, or agent behind a generic role. In this study, this category entails instances such as /(the author(s), (i) (the researcher(s), \$ (the research team) in Chinese and the author(s), the writers) and the esearchers), the research team, our team in English. The usage of third-person NPs in Example (2) llustrate how they are employed as  strategy to create a sense of detachment from the readers when presenting the research gap.

Inanimate NPs are the most oblique type of self-reference, as the author's persona is aluded to by the work they created (Chen, 2020). In Chinese academic writing, inanimate NPs that are commonly used include //i (this article), // //-/n (thi rearch),  (this work), wit all the three characters , , and i meaning \*this/the present'. In English academic writing, authors may use terms such as this/th present/current paper, his/the present/current research, thisthe present/current article, his/the present/current study, and ths/the present/current work for selfreference purposes. Example (3 illustrate a case where authors employ this category to shield their identity behind their work while making an argument. The use of such a category can efectively minimize personal subjectivit, thereby bolstering the validity of the statements being

[According to Fig. 3, the URCP model proposed in this paper is superior to other comparable models in terms of accuracy.] There is another set of inanimate noun phrases available to writer for self-reference purposes that were found in the Chinese corpus. These terms include , #, , , , , , etc (all mean my humble work'), and they indicate the author's intention to express modesty with respect to their contribution.

# 3.3. Data retrieval and analysis

During the data analysis, we utilized AntConc 4.0.11.0 (Anthony, 2022) to identify instances of self-reference. Given that a self-rerential term may potentially refer to various agents, it is necessary to consider the contextual surroundings to accurately identify these terms. Specificlly, we configured AntConc to employ the widest window span, ranging from L25 to R25 to facilitate our coding proces. We examined the concordance lines and excluded terms that did not serve the purpose of authorial self-reference. This assessment involved taking into account thecollocation of the idntified instance. Some common example of irrelevant case include (1) instances where the hits were colocated with determiners such as "" (some), \* (other), and \*" (domestic and international), as exemplified in Example (4); (2)stuations in which, within the expression authors f ." the word following "f' might not be related to the specific research under crutiny, as demonstrated in Example (6); (3) adverbial modifiers like \* in recent years) or references to specific studies, as illustrated in Examples (5) and (7).

When determining the specific category a linguistic marker could be classfied to be, the first author frst categorized these linguistic markers into specific groups by taking into account the concordance lines. Then a trained researcher examined the cate. gorization in a sample of 60 RAs randomly selected by rating each marker as either 0 (indicating no agreement) or 1 (indicating agreement for categorization as self-reference). Cohen's kappa was employed, and the analys showed a high inter-rater reliability coefficient of 0.94. The disagreements were resolved through discussion.

To facilitate comparison acros the differently sized corpora, the raw frequency of the items was normalized t 1,oo,ooo words, and Chi-square statistical tests were performed to establish whether significant differences exist in the self-rference used in the two languages and two disciplines. Since sample sizes might have an impact on p-values, this study used an extra statistic, efect size, to measure the significance of the difference between the two corpora. The scale of effect was interpreted following Cohen (1988) $\leq 0 . 1$ small effect, 0.1-0.5 medium effect, and ${ \ge } 0 . 5$ large effect.

# 4. Results and discussion

# 4.1. The comparison between Chinese- and English-language RAs

Fig. 1 shows the overall decriptive statistics of self-reference in Chinese and English RAs. As can be sen, there is a notable use of first-person pronouns in the English corpus (Norm freq. $= 5 9 2 2 . 6 3 $ ), and a preference for inanimate NPs in the Chinese corpus (Norm freq. $= 1 8 7 3 . 4 3 $ , demonstrating a marked contrast in self-reference markers between Chinese and English RAs. Table 3 presents the top five most frequent elf-reere terms i ch lanuag. Notably, in Engish RAs, the thre most frquenty usd tems are personal pronouns (we, or ), indicating a high levl of author involvement and a clear positioning of authors as central to the reearch proces. In contrast Chinese RAs follow a distinct pattern, with only one of the top five terms being a personal pronoun, namely  (we) while two of the top three are inanimate noun phrases (\$-this paper, 3this research). This suggests a preference in Chinese RAs for depersonalized self-references, indicating a tendency to subtly downplay the author's personal identity rather than explicitly asserting it. Furthermore, we found that \$ (this article) is the most commonly used self-reference marker in Chinese RAs. A frequently occurring construction is $^ { \textmd { . } }$ # (this article proposes, occurring 340 times, representing $1 1 . 8 5 \%$ of the total occurrences). Example (8) illustrates this pattern, where inanimate NPs are collocated with epistmic verbs, allowing authors to reduce ther subjectivit by atributing responsibilit for advancing subsequent claims to the research-related inanimate agents. This practice may indicate a decreased level of authorial commitment.

1.1.1. The comparison between Chinese- and English-language RAs in the linguistics corpus

Table 4 and Fig. 2 provide a comparison of Chinese-English RAs i Linguistic. Notably, there i a higher occurrence of first-person pronouns in English RAs compared to Chinese RAs $\textstyle ( \chi ^ { 2 } = 1 4 8 1 . 8 0$ $\begin{array} { r } { p = 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { , } } \end{array}$ , with a large effect size $( w = 0 . 5 3 )$ . This suggests that English Linguistics RAs exhibit a higher inclination to explicitly asert authority and project author persona in the text than their Chinese counterparts in Linguistics. This finding is consistent with Lee (2013), who observed that across three dfferent fields (Literature, Education, and Chemistry), English RAs tend to use more personal pronouns to convey higher levels of authorial inervention and personal voice than the Chinese RAs.

In the Chinese Linguistics corpus, we found that singular personal pronouns are absent and only plural forms are in use. This is especially noteworthy when considering that single-authored articles constitute $7 6 \%$ of the corpus (114 RAs). This shows that when seeking to ssert their presence through personal pronouns, allsingle-authored Chinese Linguisics RAs consistently opt for the first person plural form ] (we) over # (). Such preference for plural pronouns and the absence of singular pronouns in Chinese Linguistics RAs may be atributed to various factors, including the influence of modesty and the collctivist-oriented nature of Chinese culture. According to Chen (2020), the concept of authorship inherently carries an element f authority, which runs counter o a deely ingrained value of modesty in Chinese society. In light of this, authors tend to adopt the trategy of hiding the individual voice behind the collective voice by employing the plural personal pronouns, as exemplified in Example (9). This strategic use of plural pronouns allows writers to demonstrate humility and acknowledge that their work is built upon the collective knowledge and effrts of the academic community, thereby facilitating a more favorable reception of their work within the Chinese academic community.

Fig. 2. Frequency of the three types of self-reference in Chinese and English RAs in Linguistics (per million words) $^ { * } \operatorname { L i n } =$ Linguistics, ${ \mathrm { C } } =$ Chinese, $\mathbf { E } =$ English.

[The same is true of classroom discourse as we found in the analysis of instructional videos.]

It i alo interesting to note that the frequency of third-person Ps was consistently the least frequent among the thre categories of self-reference (Norm freq. $\mathrm { E } { \cdot } \mathrm { L i n } = 2 0 2 . 2 1$ , Norm freq. $\mathrm { C } { \cdot } \mathrm { L i n } = 4 2 1 . 5 5$ across the two linguistic/cultural corpora within Linguistics. This reflects the shared tendency of limited use of third-person NPs in both the Chinese and English-language contexts within Linguistics. This aligns with i (2014), who reported a lower prevalence of third-person NPs in both Englis and Chinese within Sociology. Despite ths similrity, a more in-depth cross-inguistic/cultural analysis reveals that the Chinese corpus exhibited a higher occurrence of third-person NPs $\textstyle \mathcal { U } ^ { 2 } = 7 8 . 3 9$ $p = 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { \AA }$ , with a medium effect size $\mathbf { \bar { \rho } } _ { w } = 0 . 3 5$ . This is consistent with Wu and Zhu (2014), who identified a greater use of third-person NPs i Chinese RAs compared to English RAs in Lingustics and Applied Linguisics. Employing third-person NPs allows authors to qualify their statements, and estblish a level of separation between themselves and their readers, which thus help to avoid potential objections from the audience (Chen, 2020). Example (10) llustrates acase in which the third-person NP # (the author) is employed to collocate with the epistemic action i (believe) to create a sense of detachment between the author and the viewpoints deliered. This linguistic strategy appears to be connected to the need to downplay the writrs role in order to establish an impersonal and objective tone, which is a common expectation in Chinese academic writing (Wu & Zhu, 2014).

The crosscorpora analysis also showed that inanimate NPs are notably more prevalent in the Chinese corpus than the English corpus in Linguistics $\textstyle \mathcal { U } ^ { 2 } = 1 8 . 8 1$ $p = 0 . 0 0 \}$ , with a small effect size $( w = 0 . 0 7 )$ . The more frequent use of inanimate NPs in Chineselanguage Linguistics RAs corroborates the findings in Lee (2013), who noted that inanimate NPs enable writers to mitigate ther authorial presence. According to Gotti (2011), depersonalized expressions involve "a reduction of the human element and a focus on the experiment's physical aspects (p.77). These inanimate expressions serve as an altenative to personal pronouns in situations where pronoun usage may be een as inrusive (Lee, 2013). For instance, the use of collocations, such as \*\$ (this sudy selects), and 633t ht (ths study compares) in Examples (1) and (12) allows authors to diminish their active role in the research procedures and shift readers' attention to the work being presented.

(C-Lin) IThis study compares the characteristics of pauses in oral production between Chinese English majors (hereinafter referred to as English majors) and native English students, and specifically answers the following questions.]

It is also of note that we identified a Chinese-specific self-reference term, namely 1F (my humble work) (Norm fre. $= 2 . 6 0 $ ) in the Chinese Linguistcs corpus. Despite is infrequent usage, the appearance of this term signals aunique Chinese language/culture-specific self-reference practice, which contributes to an impression of modest authorial identity.

4.1.2. The comparison between Chinese- and English-language RAs in the Computer Science corpus

Table 5 and Fig. 3 present the results of the cross-linguistic/cultural comparison in Computer Science. As can be sen, the frequency of first-person pronouns is significantly ower in Chinese-language Computer Science RAs than in English-language Computer Science RAs $\textstyle ( \chi ^ { 2 } = 8 6 3 7 . 7 9$ $p = 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { _ { \it } }$ , with a large effect size $( w = 1 . 0 4 ) $ . The less frequent use of first-person pronouns indicates that Chinese academic writers endeavor to convey a more objective tone in their writing. Furthermore, from a grammatical perspective, Chinese is a pro-drop language, and thus allows for the omission of pronouns when the context provides clarity (Huang, 1984; Wang et al., 2018) As ilustrated in Example (13), the subject (-we) that would logiclly appear in a sentence i omitted in hinese. This may result in a lessfrequent use of first-person pronouns in Chinese discourse, contributing to a more detached and impersonal author identity.

(13) () yi, \*T##\*1. (C-Lin) [We also found that students emotional factors could not clearly explain the use of compensatory strategies.]

As shown in Table 5, there is a discernible contrast in the frequency of singular and plural pronouns in both Chinese Computer Science and English Computer Science RAs. The total frequency of singular pronouns is significantly lower than that of the plural counterparts (Norm freq. I, my, me vs. Norm freq. we, our, $u s = 2 . 1 7$ vs. 7420.12 Norm freq., # vs. Norm freq.#17, # $\Ddot { \eta } \Dot { \jmath } \tilde { \Theta } \Im = 0$ vs. 553.45). This shows that texts in both languages/cultures within Computer Science are characterized by the collaborative nature of research activities (Biber et al., 1999).

The occurrence of third-person NPs in the Chinese corpus is significantly lower than in the English corpus $\textstyle ( \chi ^ { 2 } = 9 1 . 8 1$ $\begin{array} { r } { p = 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { , } } \end{array}$ with a large effect size $( w = 0 . 9 3 )$ . This signals that third-person NPs are not a conventional form of self-reference in the written discourse of Chinese Computer Science.

We found that the occurrence of inanimate NPs varies significantly across the two languages within Computer Science. The Chinese corpus contained greater use of inanimate NPs than the English corpus $( \chi ^ { 2 } = 5 7 2 . 6 7 , p = 0 . 0 0 )$ with a medium effect size $( w = 0 . 4 7$ indicating a more formal and impersonal authorial identity. In terms of specific linguistic markers, the es frequent use of terms such as \$/ or the esearch team/our team suggests a preference for more concise language and a focus on the research topic rather than the reearchers themseles in these two linguistic/cltural contexts within the Computer Science disciline. In addition, the author (s)/the writers) were found to be the most frequently used terms among allthird-person NPs. This indicates a trend in RAs in the English-language Computer Science discipline, wherey authors exert their identities with a strong sense of individual authorship and ownership.

4.2. The comparison between Linguistics and Computer Science RAs

Fig. 4 illustrates the overall cross-disciplinary comparisons of three categories of slf-reference in the Linguisics and Computer Science RAs. In both disciplines, there is a greater tendency to use first-person pronouns (Norm Freq. $\mathrm { C o m } = 3 8 9 7 . 5 9$ , Norm Freq. Lin $=$ 2995.48) followed by inanimate NPs (Norm Freq. $\mathrm { C o m } = 1 2 9 6 . 6 2$ , Norm Freq. $\mathrm { L i n } = 1 8 5 8 . 0 9 .$ ) and the third-person NPs (Norm Freq. $\mathrm { C o m } = 5 2 . 3 7 $ , Norm Freq. $\mathrm { L i n } = 2 8 7 . 7 7 \mathrm { \Omega }$ are least frequently used. It is necessary to be cautious when directly comparing the two disciplines, as the inclusion of two languages introduces an additional variable. Therefore, we examined the differences between Computer Science and Linguistics in Chinese and English-language RAs respectively and the results are presented in Section 4.2.1 and Section 4.2.2.

4.2.1. The comparison between Linguistics and Computer Science RAs in the Chinese corpus

The comparison between Chinese RAs in Computer Science and Linguistics is presented in Fig. 5 and Table 6. Notably, the occurrence of first-person pronouns was significantly lower in Computer Science RAs than in Linguistics RAs in the Chinese corpora $\textstyle ( \chi ^ { 2 }$ $= 2 1 7 . 0 0$ $p = 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { \AA }$ , with a moderate effect size $( w = 0 . 3 6 )$ . This suggests that the Chinese Computer Science RAs tend to exhibit a mitigated presence of personal authorship within the text compared to their counterparts in Linguistics. As noted by Xv and Sun (2018), Computer Science entails the scientific examination of computational processes, involving the manipulation of symbols for information processing. The result indicates that authors in this field tend to adopt a les intrusive and more impersonal writin tyle, aiming to enhance the perceived objectivity of their interpretations and subdue their own authorial voice in favor of an unmediated presentation of information (Hyland, 2001). This commitment to objectivity is exemplified through the use of heding markrs, such as # (relatively), andit $( t r y )$ , which serves to reduce the subjectivity associated with authorial presence, as exemplified in Examples (14) and (15).

Table 6 provides a detailed analysis of first-person pronoun usage across two disciplines within the Chinese corpus. Notably, both disciplines are found to contain the highest frequency of # (we), followed by  (our), and a notable absence of singular pronouns. However, when comparing the two corpora, variations emerged in the frequencies of usage of # (our) and # (we).

Specifically, Computer Science RAs contain fewer instances of F] (we) $( \chi ^ { 2 } = 2 3 4 . 4 3 , p = 0 . 0 0$ ${ w = 0 . 3 9 }$ ) but more instances of #1J (our) $\textstyle ( \chi ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 5$ $p = 0 . 7 0$ $w = 0 . 0 4 $ A closer examination reveals that F (our) is often used in conjunction with terms like (approach) and # (algorithm) to elucidate research procedures in Chinese Computer Science RAs. This implies that Chinese Computer Science RAs tend to downplay the author's role, focusing more on the methodologies and processes involved, thereby indirectly highlighting their contribution to research outcomes and activities.

Also, Computer Science RAs in Chinese exhibit a significantly lower usage of terms such as /  (the author) $( \chi ^ { 2 } = 4 0 2 . 6 1 , p =$ 0.00, $w = 1 . 1 9 \AA$ and 3 (the researcher) $\textstyle \mathcal { U } ^ { 2 } = 1 5 1 . 0 9$ $p = 0 . 0 0$ $w = 1 . 0 1$ ). However, neither  (the research team) nor F (our research tem) is employed in either disciplie. This suggets that rearchers in Chinese Linguistics and Chinese Computer Science are less likely to explicitly refer to their teams when conveying collaborative efforts.

The analysis also identified variations in the usage of inanimate NPs between these two disciplines. pecifically, Chinese Linguistics RAs contain more inanimate $\mathrm { N P s } ( \chi ^ { 2 } = 1 4 . 3 1 , p = 0 . 0 0 )$ , with a small effect size $\left( w = 0 . 0 6 \right)$ . This suggests that Chinese Linguistics RAs display a higher preference for employing inanimate NPs to establish a more impersonalized authorial identit. It is also interesting to note that the lexical choice f inanimate NPs were dffernt in the two corpora. Speficall, Linguistic RAs in Chinese tend toportray authors' work as an ongoing proces of investigation (/t/\$///-/n-the present research), while Computer Science RAs in Chinese tend to emphasize the final outcome or the product of the authors' work (l/\$/i-the present article)

4.2.2. The comparison between Linguistics and Computer Science RAs in the English corpus

Fig. 6 and Table 7 present the comparison of Computer Science-Linguisics RAs in the English corpora. As can be seen, the use of first-person pronouns in Computer Science RAs is significantly higher than that in Linguistics RAs (Norm freq. $\mathrm { E - C o m } = 7 4 2 2 . 2 9$ , Norm freq. $\mathrm { E - L i n } = 4 1 9 4 . 0 4 \AA$ . This suggests that English Computer Science RAs tend to assert more visible author's presence in text. As Computer Science is a large, fercely-competitive, intenational community, promoting the author's work to enhance its reception is vitall important (Cheung & Lau, 2020). The use of personal pronouns helps writers to establish a credible, unique scholarly identity and to underscore the originalit of thir contributions to the English-language Computer Science field. As llustratd in Examples (16) and (17), the adjectives (novel, new, important) frequently co-occur with the pronouns we, our in English Computer Science RAs to underscore the novelty and significance of the work.

(16) To mitigate this complexity, we propose a novel two-level scheduler. (E-Com)   
(17) In contrast, our new method reduced QoS analysis errors by $8 4 . 4 \substack { - 8 9 . 6 \% }$ for the service-based system and by $9 4 . 7 \mathrm { - } 9 7 \%$ for the IT support system, significantly lowering the risk of such invalid decisions. (E-Com)

As shown in Table 7, there are significant differences in the use of first-person pronouns in the two disciplinary corpora $( p < 0 . 0 1 )$ except for the pronouns me and us. The occurrence of the subject pronoun we in the English Computer Science corpus s significantly higher $\textstyle ( \chi ^ { 2 } = 1 2 8 1 . 3 3$ $p = 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { , }$ , with a medium effect size $( w = 0 . 4 0 )$ . Example (18) shows writer's active role in conducting the research by the combination of research-related verbs with the pronoun we. Our was a common marker of authorial identity in both disciplines and was more prevalent in Computer Science research articles $( \chi ^ { 2 } = 6 3 2 . 7 9 , p = 0 . 0 0 )$ , with a medium effect size $( w = 0 . 4 8 )$ An analysis of the concordance lines revealed that computer cientists frequently used our in conjunction with rearch-related terms such as pproach, methods, experiment, or data in the text. Examples (19) and (20) llustrat two typical instances where the authors ownership and responsibilit for the research results, as well as their contributions to the disciplinary community, are prominently emphasized by formulations that include our. Us was used sparingly and showed no significant variation acros the two disciplines $\left( p = \right.$ 0.039), suggesting that there may be no dicipline-spific iference in the frequency of this pronoun. Addtionally, us often followed verbs such as et, alow, and give to introduce the rationale behind the decision and explain the benefits of their methods in the text. Example (21) provides an illstration of the authors explaining the reason for their methodological decision and elaborating on the methodological process, which contributes to strengthening their credibility in conveying their claims.

(18) We implemented and tested a high-level protocol for ensuring safety when reconfiguring one or more chips. (E-Com)   
(19) Next, we describe our approach to handle high volumes f real-time transactions and how we minimize the transaction/inquiry response time. (E-Com)   
(20) Differently, our method uses a simple combination of motion and shape cues to capture a diversified set of vehicles during extended periods of time. (E-Com)   
(21) We use the high-connectivity scenario with 0.5 percent service fault rate and 60-s time window size. The larger window size allows us to more easily see the reduction in each step. (E-Com)

In addition, notable diffrences were identified between the two disciplinary corpora in English concerning the frequency of inanimate NPs $( p < 0 . 0 1 )$ , except for the term this/the present/current article. This suggests that the observed variations in inanimate NPs usage can be largely atriuted to distinct disciplinary practices and norms. Linguist have been described as language-sensitive expert writers" (Li, 2021, p.7), and it is thus perhaps understandable that English Linguistics RAs should employ a range of inanimate NPs for authorial self-reference, thereby conveying a more nuanced sense f authorship. Additionally, it i worth noting that this/the

# 5. Conclusion

This study explores the use of three types of elf-rference markers fom cos linguistic/cultural (Chinese and English) and cross disciplinary (Linguistics and Computer Science) perspectives. The analysis shows that the two corpora are diferent not only in the use of slf-reference resources, including culture/language-specific terms, but also in the degrees to which authors asert themselves in their texts to construct authoritative identities. In both disciplines, English-language RAs tend to assert explicit, confident, and authoritative identities, mainly by using first-person pronouns to underscore the centrality of their arguments.In contrast, Chinese. language RAs adopt a subtler and more restrained approach to construct their authorial identit through the use of depersonalized NPs. Additionally, Chinese-language RAs prefer to use first-person plural forms over singular forms, emphasizing the collaborative nature in academic texts. Although expressions of modest, such as my humble work are infrequent, their presence underscores the cultural value of modesty within Chinese academic discourse. These findings point to the diverging practices adopted by researchers within different linguistic/cultural contexts, emphasizing the need to be more sensitive when navigating between these two languages in academic writing.

According to the cross-disciplinary analyses, more complex variations emerge, which are expressed diffrently in the two linguistic/cultural corpora. English Computer Science texts show a more evident authorial presence, particularly in using first-person pronouns, than Linguistics texts in English, while Chinese RAs display the opposite pattrn and convey a les visible authorial persona. The divergent cross-disciplinary findings suggest that the writer's choice of self-reference and authorial presence is shaped by a complex interplay of factors, including disciplinary conventions, cultural norms, language grammars, and target audience. The analysis indicates that authors from different inguistic backgrounds tend to employ distinctive resources, structures, and linguistic/ cultural nuances to project themselves into the narrtive. This work contributes to the field of writer identit in academic writing research in the following aspects. Firt, it extends previous work by adopting a comprehensive analytical framework, including three types of self-reference, and thus provides a more refined picture of how authorial identit is manifested by linguistc/cultural and disciplinary norms. In addition, this study illstrates that discrepancies between the English and Chinese-language corpora and the cross-disciplinary variations are influenced by a multitude of factors, such as epistemological ideologies and knowledge-making practices of the field, the publication context, and linguistic and cultural rhetorical conventions. Finall, the findings from this cross-inguistc and cross-disciplinary analysis can inform a possile future investigation into self-reference in the interdiscipline of Computational Linguistics, as illustrated by the cross- and interdisciplinary focus in Dong and Buckingham (2023).

Pedagogicall, this study is ofvalue for bilingual cholars seeking to publish their work in both Englis and Chinee They may need to cultivate a heightened awarenessof the rhetorical nuances of sef-reference practices in both Chinese and English-language academic writing, which can enable them to construct an appropriate authorial persona in their bilingual publications. In addition, bilingual scholars also need to recognize the complexit of self-reference practices and multiple influencing factors, such as disci. plinary and cultural conventions, as exemplified in this study. In an English for Academic Purposes course, instructors can assist students in secting appropriat self-reference markers to exercise suitable authorial presence in accordance with discilinary norms.

It i necessary to point out that this cross-disciplinary study was limited to Chinese and English-language RAs. Future studies may consider other languages that are commonly used in academic publishing to test the crossdisciplinary indings in the present study. In addition, as revealed in the analyis, uthors use of self-rfrence is influenced y a multitude f factors. Future rerch may need to take other potential factors into account, such as writers educational background, journal requirements (e.g., Gao, 2017; Vold, 2006), journal types (e.g., sCI, SCI, csscI- indexed journals versus those not indexed), as well as other academic genres (e.g., theses or conference presentations) to gain a more comprehensive picture of writer identity construction in diffrent rhetorical contexts.
