In this paper, I investigate the ways human-AI collaboration could transform writing practices including feedback and revision. By closely examining an AI-generated essay, I expose potential gaps and contradictions in the essay and prompt ChatGPT to compose more nuanced writing. In inviting a dialectical negotiation with AI through iterative prompting and collaborative writing, I illuminate dissonances between content and style in the AI-generated essay. I proffer that interacting with AI language models can encourage students to engage critically with writerly choices by identifying instances in which AI-generated texts could consider alternative ideas or diverse perspectives. Ultimately, I contribute an innovative approach to collaborative storytelling with AI.

# 1. Introduction

The advent f generative Al invites writing studies cholar-practitioners to rethink the nature of composing, spurring questions over what it means to think and create. Writers are considering whether large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT can write in nuanced ways or emulate the styles of authors such as Shakespeare and Dickens (Hartenberger, 2023). While Hartenberger (2023) critiques ChatGPT for producing "somewhat predictable" outputs, human writers can offer feedback on AI-generated texts, which could lead LLMs to produce more complex, nuanced writing as the language models continue to evolve. Wang (2019) proposes a human-in-the-lop" approach to interacting with AI systems, describing the potential for "a proces that harnesses the efficiency of intelligent automation whil remaining amenable to human feedback, all while retaning a greater sense of meaning.' In conceptualizing "a duality between automation and human interaction" emphasis in the originall, Wang poses the question: How might we use AI to augment human capabilites, incorporating human interaction, preference, and udgment, in order to design more useful and meaningful AIsystems?" Such a question -- on the ways we as teachers and scholars of writing might preserve or even augment meaning in writing in the face of increasing automation - is vital to investigate as generative Al becomes increasingly prevalent as a tool for writing, especially in educational contexts (Roose, 2023).

Recent scholarship has examined the potential for human-AI collaboration in diverse writing contexts. Studies have investigated the ways AI could asst with creative writing (Coenen et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2022), compose The Divine Comedy (Floridi, 2023), and create digital marketing copy in professional communication (Knowles, 2022). Yet amid pressing debates over the ramifications of generative Al for critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration, as well as concerns over research ethics and academic integrity (Anderson, 2023; Johnson, 2023), there arises a need to interrogate the impacts of Al-human collaboration on writing studies writ large, including the implications of integrating generative Al into writing pedagogy (MLA-ccc Joint Task Force on Writing & AI, 2023). The MLA-ccc Joint Task Force posits that AI language modelscould "augment the drafting and revising processes of writers for a variety of purposes" (p. 8). Considering the emphasis of writing pedagogy on the composing proces, it becomes essential to examine the ways composing with AI may afect processes such as drafting and revision. et composing withAI could carry many risks. in acknowledging the ethical issues associated with Al tools, including the lack of source transparency and the risks of plagiarism, Anderson (2023) noes a need t ostr citical digital literacy in developing strategies for supportig students to gage thoughully with AI (p. 10). Building on Anderson, who articulates \*the importance of careful rflection on writing and the writing process" when considering whether to incorporate ChatGPT in the writing classoom (p. 9), Iattend criticall to the ways composing with AI ould afford or constrain the writing process I thus respond to the MLA-cccc Joint Task Force's contention that "our understanding of writing and how it i taught requires reenvisioning in the light of what loks to be seismic shfts warranted by large language models" (p. 4).

In this article, I offer an innovative approach to conceptualizing writerly collaboration with Al. I draw from Flower and Hayes (1981) cognitive processtheory of writing and Sommers' (1980, 1982) theories of revision and response to writing, scholarship on collaboration and response, as well as theories of Bakhtinian dialogism and digital rhetoric (Eyman, 2015; Krause, 1996) to recontextualize the composing process in the era of generative AI. I study my interactions with ChatGPT, an LLM trained on a large corpus of data, \*allowing it to learn language patterns and asociations which i usesto generate human-like conversational text when prompted (Lingard, 2023). As Perrottae al. (2022) explan, by using proces of "self-attntion, \*an inut can interact with itself to estimate (probabilisticlly) where it should direct its atention in a data distribution, forming linguisticlly accurate asscitin... [that] take into consideration the relationships between words in a sentence" (p. 6) In(re)generating from existing human-written texts, LMs produce predictive outputs based on the words and phrases that are likely to occur in a sequence of human-written text To illustrate a possible approach to composing with Al, I closely read an example exchange with ChatGPT in which I prompted the language model to compose an essay in the style of Chilean American writer Agosin (2012). I chose to analyze Agosin's work in particular because I have taught \*Always Living in Spanish" in my frs-year writing classes. With each successive reading and dis cussion of th esay, I have grown to appreciate it intertwining of memory and identity, its rhythms and undulations, its layered evocations. I am especially fascnated by the sensethat writing in one's mother tongue \*could recover fragrances, spoken rhythms, and the passion of [one's own] identity' as words transcend articulation into transfiguration. I was curious to see whether ChatGPT could capture the visceral, sensory dimensions of language by which words transmute into meaning, enriching one's "sense of being." My choice to engage with Agosin's writing also carries resonances with Agosin's desire to \*recover the familiar" within the strange: to summon an artificial introcutor to imtate a famliar text is tocrate  lippageno alterit as words are reconured, echo obliquely by a disembodied voice, rematerializing in altered forms, perhaps resounding with unexpected meanings. My choice of Agosin's work also carries personal reonances: I atended Wellesley College whre gsin is a profesor of ansh, ad  took clases in the Spanish department. In ths sense, resonances arise from the depths of memory, reverberating in surprising ways, as branching out into new directions of inquiry simultaneously gestures toward a returning to one's roots.

# 2. Reimagining writing process theory in the era of AI

In conceptualizing writing in the era of AI technologies, Idraw from Flower and Hayes (1981) cognitie proces theory of writing. posit that interactions between humans and AI may iluminate the workings of the writing process, rendering visible the "moment-to-moment process of composing (Flower and Hayes, p. 373). By prompting ChatGPT to revise drafts, writers can visualize the revision processas it unfolds in real time as human feedback deepens or complicates an AlI-generated text. By engaging in continuous back-and-forth conversations with ChatGPT, writers can shape an AI-generated text in a near-instantaneous fashion, in a textual transaction (Rosenblatt, 1994) between the user and the tol.I conceptualize Al-human interactions as a mutually constitutive process that can stimulate what Sommers (1980) terms the \*recursive shaping of language" (p. 379) in both human and AI writing. Such a proces could become further complicated in the context of generative AI: as Graham (2023) writes, \*AI provides the opportunity to add multiple dimensions of recursion where prompt-engineering, output curation, fact-checking, and revision become an orthogonal dimension to traditional writig and learning proceses"(p. 166). In dialogue with AI, writer can simultaneously witness and influence the (re)shaping of language in a text, in an unfolding of meaning.

Significantly, Flower and Hayes' notion of \*regeneration'-the idea that writer can "regenerate [their] own goals" (p. 386)-could be interpreted in multiple ways: in the sense that ChatGPT (re)generates outputs from an existing corpus f texts, and in the sense that ChatGPT can \*regenerate" a response to a prompt, producing multiple versions or iterations that might be read as variations on a theme, a phenomenon Eyman (2015) terms variabilit, in the sense that \*a new media object typicallygives rise to many different versions' that are "often in part automatically assembled by a computer (p. 36). In a recursive process of goal setting and idea generation, students in a writing classcould leverage ChatGPT as a conversation partner as both human and AI writers could generate increasingly complex ideas, as the potential pathways for composing a text could expand and diverge, echoing Krause's (1996) sense of \*the multiplicity of avenues of discourse within any given situation' (n.p.). Such a proces of regeneration could produce a proliferation of potentialitie, inviting multiple possible pathways for rethinking and regenerating a text. We could envision such pathways as neural pathways that branch outward, expanding rhizomatically (Deleuze & Guattari, 2013) in a continuous flow of expression unfolding in a synchronous environment. As the Al-human feedback cycles invite layers of recursivity, we can recast the writing process as "fluid" (Krause, 1996), reimagining Al-human collaboration as participatory, dynamic, and interactive.

# 3. Scholarship on collaboration

In investigating the potential for Al-human collaboration, I situate this analysis in the scholarship on collaboration. In theorizing collaboration as conversation, Bruffe (1984) writes, o think well as individuals we must lean to think well ollectively-that is, e must lean to converse well (p. 640). Bruffee onceptualizes knowledge as  state f continual negtiation" as claborators negotiat [e] ollctively toward nw paradgms of ertion, thought, feeling, and expression (. 646). While rufee positions encultration into academic discourse communities as an aim of collaborative knowledge production, Trimbur (1989) interrogates the notion of scholarly "consensus" within Bruffe's theorization. Trimbur rethinks the way consensus could provoke critical examinations of knowledge, suggesting that consensus could \*offer students a powerful critical instrument to interrgate the conversation -- to interrupt it in order to investigate th forces which determine who may speak and what may be said, what inhibits communication and what makes it possible (p. 612). In critiquing the models of collaboration posed by Bruffe and Trimbur, Duff (2014) questions the idea of collaboration as conversation and focuses instead on the "discursive processes at work when writer collaborate' (p. 421)-- processes inflected by moments of resistance or constraint in the negotiation of meaning. Duffy contends that collaboration can generate new knowledge and facilitat the invention of new perspectives that i turn allow for novel articulations of discourse" (p. 422). Together, Bruffe, Trimbur, and Duffy's conceptions of collaboration lluminate insights into the processes by which writers negotiate and critique knowledge while generating new ways of knowing.

This scholarship on collaboration raises implications for theorizing collaboration with LLMs. In producing predictive output based on an accumulated corpus of existing knowledge, ChatGPT-produced texts might be critiqued as reinstating \*canonical' knowledge, yet AI-human collaboration could invite the potential for the negotiation of new knowledge as human users refine Al-generated re. sponses. By conversing with AI, writers can subvert or complicate the \*established" forms of knowledge embedded in AI texts inviting the possbility of compositions that express ideas with \*complexity and "subtlety" (Bruffe, p. 640). By drawing on Trimbur's conception of "consensus as a critical istrument to open gaps in the converstion through which differences may emerge (p. 614) writers could identify gaps, assumptions, or contradictions embedded within a ChatGPT response, opening avenues for more nuanced compositions. Following Duffy, I suggest that Al-human collaboration could stimulate spaces for writer to (re)generate and (re) articulate discourse through the entanglements between a human user and an artificial interlocutor.

Following Hunter's (2011) conception of digital authorship as "collaboratie and communal" as well as Alalem's (2023) framework for "cultivating a participatory culture' in the first-year writing classoom through digitl storytelling, I offer an approach to collaborative storytelling with Al. In recontextualizing writing conversations within LM interfaces, I posit that human-AI collaboration could fster participatory engagement with AI while positioning human writers as agents in the composing proces (Jones & Beck, 2020).

# l. Language, memory, and translation in the writings of Marjorie Agosin

I situate this study within storytelling, investigating the extent to which ChatGPT can compose stories, which simultaneously express and reflect the human condition. The field of writing studies has witnessed reent turns to story and counterstory, including Martinez (2013) methodology for counterstorying within the framework of critical race theory. Yet relatively few calls for storying have discussed the digital domain, including scholarship by Has (2007) and Arola (2018) in the context of American Indian story. telling traditions and Banks (2011) from the perspective of African American discourses. Within this interwoven web of scholarship at the interface of the print and digital, seek to trace an emergent thead of possibility in collaborative storytelling with Al. Echoing Haas' notion of wampum as hypertext, we could envision ChatGPT's corpus as a form of hypertext - as astring of beads that carry memory, thatsignify meaning," as "memories of inherited knowledges" that can be refashioned through remediation (p.77,p. 85). To exhume memory from the latent depths of the corpus is to summon insight, to awaken articulations from the realm of artifice. In disentangling layers of tries..woven together' (Haas, p. 88), I conceptualize AI-human collaboration as an inricate weave of storytelling, a delicate dance, a dialectical interplay between human and AIcollaborators. To experiment with human-Al storytelling is to simultaneously probe the possbilitie of digital futritie and to inite turn to the primordial element --to the tangible, gstral, emotive, embodied dimensions of expression. As we expose the textual fabric, recasting familiar threads to new light, we can wrest vestige of hmanty from the alterity of atfice, from the acculated mass f txt in the corus. To tl storie is to eek glimpses of the human within the post-human..

In my analysis, focus on the writings of Marjorie Agosin, a Chilean American writer whose poems, essays, and stories negotiate the intertwining of language and memory within the contex of exile and displacement. gosin's esays can be read as iteracy narratives, a commonly taught assgnment in writing classrooms that invites students to reflect on their lived experiences and to criticall interrogate the connections between literacy and identity (Willams, 2003). Below are the opening paragraphs of Agosin's essay "Always Living in Spanish'" (2012), which I teach as a model text as part of a literacy narrative unit in a first-year writing course:

In the evenings in the northern hemisphere, I repeat the ancient ritual that I observed as a child in the southern hemisphere. going out while the night is stil warm and trying to recognize the stars as it begins to grow dark silently. In the sky of my country, Chile, that long and wide tretch of land that the poets blessed and dictators abused, I could easily name the stars: the three Marias, the Southern Cross, and the three Lilies, names of beloved and courageous women. But here in the United States, where I have lived since I was  young gir, the solitude of exile makes me feel that so littl is mine, that not even the sky has the same constellations, the tres and the fauna the same names or sounds, or the rubbish the same smell. How does one recover the familiar? How does one name the unfamiliar? How can one be another or live in a foreign language? These are the dilemmas of one who writes in Spanish and lives in translation..

These opening lines convey the way language speaks into existence, conjures into being. In beginning with a\*ritual," Agosin echoes Frye's (1951) contention that \*in ritual. we may find the origin of narrative" (103). In her narrative, Agosin cast anguage as imbued with memory -- \*the memory of spaces inhabited in the past." Agosin recounts that in Chile, she "could easily name the stars" invoking the idea that t speak into being is tolanguage the world into existence (Inoue, 2019, p. 359). To lose one's language is akin to losing oneself, one's sense of being and understanding. Agosin poses the questions: \*How does one recover the familiar? How does one name the unfamiliar? How can one be another or live in a foreign language?" In grappling with what it means to "recover the familiar' within the strange, Agosin seeks toward reconstellting the self in a place where "not even the sky has the same constellations."

In the essay, Agosin articulates the way language and translation serve as vehicle for the preservation of memory, both individual and communal: \*'ecause of translation, my memory has now become part f the memory of many others. The word translation, in its common usage, denotes the proces of translating from one language to another, yet translation could also signify \*he expression or rendering of a thing in another medium or form; the conversion or adaptation of a thing to another system, context, or use (Oxford English Dictionary, 2023). When we prompt ChatGPT to write in the style of a particular author, we encounter translation in this different sense: the translation of the human into the artificial in a remediation of sort, as an LLM remediates paterns of language from its corpus into a geerated response. In such a proces of remediation, a writers words ae expressed" and "\*rendered anew \*in another medium or form,' refashioned by an artificially intelligent system.

The advent of generative Al invites scholars to re-envision the enlacement of memory, language, and translation. I posit that translations between human and AI writing could be conceived as transmedial (Rajewsky, 2005)-as a form of mediation across human and artificial realms. Al-human translations traverse embodied,situated human writers and disembodied, decontextualizd artificial interlocutors, lingring at the threshold between (a writrs) voice and (it istant yet intimate) echo, betwee (literary, human) lies and (artificial) aflie. t ee as artifcl intellie ems toap matriality, to trnsedphmenlogy, to intface wth Al is, as Inoue (2015) writes to \*acknowledge the fluid boundaries betwen ourselves and others" (p. 104) to restuate is seemingly ethereal quality within "sensual, material, and phenomenological groundings" (p. 101). Fllowing Inoue's conception of writig assessment ecologies "as a larger set of people, environments, relations, labor, and exchanges" (p. 102), we are reminded that ChatGPT, in it conception and design, emerges from the labor of human production, drawing from a corpus of human-writte texts. In this sense, we discover the fluidity of human-Al interactions as we encounter vestiges of materiality emanating from the artificial:

To navigate the interstitial spaces etween the human and the artificial is in a sense, to translate between modes of being. Gonzales (2018) conceptualizes translation as "a blending and movement of discourses as individuals make meaning from person to person' (p. 43). Echoing Gonzales idea that \*language is constantly in motion," we might encounter in human-Al dialogue a sense of movement as a writer's expression dissiates into the folds of textuality and (reemerges as artifil articulation. Gonzales conceptualizes translation as a "situated, \*cyclical," and \*creative" proces wherein translators "creatively layer and repurpose meaning," producing "linguistic transformations (p. 60-61). We could thus envision Al-human dialogue as relational: as a dynamic sit of meaning-making, as a process of mutual transformation. To traverse human and AI writing is thus to trace the porous boundaries through which ideas emerge and dissipate, seeping into the layers of thought and memory while evolving into new forms.

Extending Gonzales theory of translation to the era of generative Al, we might ask whether ChatGPT can translate a writer's words in a way that captures the writer's meaning or even adapts or transforms meaning for an increasingly interconnected, digitally mediated audience. In Agosin's writing, language mirrors meaning, expressions working in conjunction with the ideas, as in the following line, in which the undulating phrasings mirror the notion of Spanish as an undulating language: I miss that undulating and sensuous language of mine, those baroque descriptions, the sense of being and feeling that Spanish gives me." Agosin's phrasings merge the sensory, the lyricl, and the emotive in a lilting parallelism: \*.by writin in Spanish I could recover fragrances, poken rhythms, and the passon of my identity." In this new phenomenon of human-AI translation, we might ask whether the layering of meaning, the evocations of language can translate to an artificially generated text. In grappling with such a question, I examine the extent to which an LM trained to generate paterns of language can express the "visceral emotions' (Agosin) immanent in poetic or metaphorical language. I investigate whether an artifially intelligent language tool could convey depth of emotion or insight, capturing a "sense of being and feeling (Agosin) or intimating the ineffable, inarticulable dimensions of experience. In delving into stories, we encounter the way meaning transcends language, inhabiting a realm beyond the words themselves.

Yet translation carries another meaning as the action of ascending to or being received into heaven or the afterlife" (OED). In conceptualizing translation in this sense, we could envision an l-geneated text witten in an authorstyle as the aferlif of th text, in the way multiple afterlives proliferat from an original text. In conceptualizing the afterlif of digital writing," Gallagher (2020) delineates the ways digital interfaces enable "a continuous process of rewriting and rereading texts with the expectation that digtal texts wil be different at subsequent times (p. 8). I posit that the advent of gnerative I could further acelerat the proess by which "texts circulate rapidly, words mutate, and images become modified' (Gallgher, p. 8). As words morph and mutate in a layered unraveling, we encounter the malleability of language.

While Gallgher investigates how writers or discourse producers alter their activities in response to audience input' (p. 6), I examine the ways Al language models and human collaborators could continually lter a writer's work. In investigating the potential for LLMs to regenerate texts, we might ask whether AI could serve as an agent of translation that engenders textual aferies its generativity enriching a familiar text with new layers of meaning, or whether its imitations carry mere echoes or vestiges of the original. o read or listen to a writer's voice in an artificilly gnerated form is to encounter a sense of strangeness within th familiar as a text is altered or refashioned. To alter form is totansform: as a material process human-Al collaborative torytelling charts an uncanny paage through the artificial and the human realms: a slippage of strangeness into familiarit, which slips into strangeness once more. Such a sense of altering a text --f inhabiting altered forms, traversing altered states of being - conjures the idea that to write is to transgress into lterity -- an uncanny yet distinctly human conception. To write is to undergo an undoing, a retreat into nonbeing, even as in the unraveling, we glimpse new light.

# 5. A note on methods

In initiating an exchange with ChatGPT, I began with a general prompt for the LLM to \*write in the style of Marjorie Agosin." Based on ChatGT's responses offered further prompts that asked ChatGPT to rewrite the esay with an attention to specific historical and geographical contexts. In total, I prompted ChatGPT to generate four iterations of an essay written in the style of Agosin. In closely analyzing the ChatGPT-produced essays, I carefull examined the meanings infused in particular words, phrases, and lines,attending to expressions that elide meaning or situatedness In the analysis, juxtaposed passages from gosin' essay \*Always Living in Spanish" with passage from the ChatGPT-generated esays. WhileI did not feed Agosin's writing into ChatGPT, I did prompt ChatGPT to write an interpretation of Agosin's essay \*Always Living in Spanish" and incorporated language from ChatGPT's interpretation into my prompt for the fourth iteration of the ChatGPT-generated essay.

# 6. The artificial afterlives of Agosin's writings

When I prompted ChatGPT to "write in the style of Marjorie Agosin,' it responded:

In the gentle embrace of the morning light, Ifind solace amidst the whispers of the wind. The delicate petals of wildflowers sway gracefully, a if dancing to an ancient melody, carrying the storie of forgotten souls who once tread this sacred land. My heart, too, hums with the echoes of their past, yearning to preserve their memory in the tapestry of my words.

In this fleting moment of tranquility, I contemplate the resilience of human spirit, borne from the ashes of adversity, like a phoenix rising from the depths of despair. The scars of history etched into the very fabric of our existence serve as areminder of our shared humanity, woven together by threads of sorrow and joy, hope and despair...

The essay's opening lines convey a soft imagery (the gentle embrace of the morning light, \*the whispers of the wind," the "delicate petas of wildflowers sway[ing gracefully). The phrases echo Agosin's \*yearning to preserve..memory in the tapestry of my words." Yet phrases such as "ancient melody, forgotten souls," "sacred land," and "echoe of their past" are reminiscent of the ways narratives may often represent marginalized communities, especially indigenous communities, as ahistorical, \*ancient,' or as inhabiting a timeless, idealized, or utopian past (Hill  DeHass, 2018). The image of "a phoenix rising from the depths of despair" "borne from the ashes of adversity presents an overused metaphor, as does the phrase the scars of history etched into the very fabric of our existence," which gestures toward yet eldes the nature of the "scars' to which the expression alludes. The effect is one of vagueness and indeterminacy as the descriptions are extricated from their contexts, detached from any place or time.

The rest of the essay likewise seems to celebrate a sense of timelesness and transcendence that reverberates across the boundaries of culture and language":

Amongst the ruins of forgotten ruins, I discover theremnants of a forgotten civilization, its essence tillingring in the whispers Of the breeze. feel a profound conection to these ancient souls, as if our hearts beat in unison acros the vast expanse of time. In their stories, I find the timeles truths of love, los, and resilience that transcend the boundaries of culture and language. Through my pen, I trive to honor the voices silenced by history, amplifying thir narratives so they may echo through the ages. It is a delicate dance, akin to crafting a symphony of words that resounds with the essence of life's grand tapestry. And in this dance I find my purpose as a storyteller, weaving together the past and present into a seamless embrace of memory and dreams.

In this passage, phrases such as emnants of forgotten civilization depict a ense of ancient remains f relics cast offby history, untouched y modnt, whle th idfa civilizationsce is, i it vey dtion, essntiing. While th writer \*strive [s] to honor the voices silenced by history, the omission of specific contexts paradoxicaly silences the voices the essay strives to honor. Agosin's originalessay emphasizes the importance of naming in making sense of the world, in giving articulation to one's own sense of being (In the sky of my country, Chil.. could easily name the stars"). That the voices are left unnamed in the ChatGPTproduced essay exposes a clear gap in the AI model's understanding, illuminating a disconnect between the model's ability to replicate style and its capacity to represent lived experience, which it can only mimic. Akin to \*the ruins of forgotten ruins," the ChatGPT-produced essay sounds an echo of an echo, bearing the distant echoes of literary traditions yet drifing away from sit uatednes in is spatial, temporal, historical, and political dimensions -- dimensions that are erased, unacknowledged, nonexistent in these artificial afterlives.

In encouraging ChatGPT to specify its ideas within a particular context, I responded: \*Can you rewrite this essay in a way that specifies whose voices have been 'silenced by history' and clarifies whose'struggles and triumphs' you are describing?" ChatGPT responded:

In this fleeting moment of tranquility, I contemplate the resilience of women's spirits, borne from the ashes of gender inequality and discrimination, like phoenixes rising from the depths of despair. The scars of their history etched into the very fabric of our existence serve as a reminder of our shared humanity, woven together by threads of sorrow and joy, hope and despair...

Amongst the ruins of forgotten civlizations, I discover the remnants of women who have been left out of mainstream his torical narratives. Their essence stillingers in the whispers of the breze, silently asking toberemembered and acknowledged. feel profound connection to these ancient souls, as if our hearts beat in unison acrossthe vast expanse ftime. In their stries, I find the timeless truths of love, loss, and resilience that transcend the boundaries of culture and language.

Through my pen, I strive to honor the voices of marginalized women silenced by history, amplifying their narratives so they may echo through the ages... [emphases are my own]

As illustrated, the revised version of the essay simply replaces the word "human" with the word women," so that instead of "contemplating] the resilience of human spirit thesay now contemplate[s] the esilience of women's spirits while the "ashes of adversity" become \*the ashes of gender inequality and discrimination' -- a somewhat more specific yet still vague and decontextualized generalization. The revision illstrates the limits of simply relacing certain words and phrases with others, which may lead to semantically and materially questionable phrases such as "remnants of women," areplacement for the phrase "remnants of civilzation' in the initial response. Meanwhile, the rest of the essay retains the generalities of the initial draft, as the focus on women's experiences in this second draft is merely nominal and does not extend beyond a few replacement words and phrases.

In seeking to further situate the essay in a particular context,I responded: I appreciate the way you are honoring the voices of marginalized women. Can you please revise the essay to situate your ideas within a particular national and geographic context?" As shown below, the third draft simply adds the word "Chilean' before "women":

In the gentle embrace of the morning light, I find solace amidst the whispers of the wind. The delicate petals of wildflowers sway gracfull, as if dancing to an ancient melody, carrying the stories of Chilean women who once tread this sacred land. My heart, too, hums with the echoes of their past, yearning to preserve their memory in the tapestry of my words.

In this fleeting moment of tranqulity, I contemplate the resilience of Chilean women's spirits, borne from the ashes of a tumultuous history, like phoenixes rising from the depths of despair... [emphases are my own]

In repeating a pattern of replacing and adding words, this response lluminates the ways language becomes emptied of meaning, as words serve as empty signifiers that fil blanks yet remain devoid of substance, as the signfier flats away from the signfied. The richness and dimensionality of Agosin's language collapses into a single sign, as though a descriptor, once repeated, could gain meaning through repetition. With its perhaps mechanical repetitiveness, the response conveys a sense of language as additive or subtractie, as mere patterns of lexicon and syntax plugged into a predictable formula. This form of surface-level revision could resemble the way student writers might be tempted to \*find and replace" words in an essay rather than engaging more critically and intentionally with a substantive rethinking of a draft (Sommers, 1980).

Each version of the Al-generated essay is illed with an expanse of words yet elides' situatedness, exposing the limitations of Ianguage in the absence of meaning and, perhaps, in the absence of thinking. Nevertheles, a space opens for the potential of AIgenerated revisions to progress beyond form, toward the substance" (Lau et al, 2018) of writing. In noting the relative eficacy of AI-generated interpretations, I asked ChatGPT to write an interpretation of Agosin's essay \*Always Living in Spanish." Within its response, ChatGPT identifies the ways Agosin's essay "explores the complexities of identity and belonging" and \*delves into the emotional impact of displacement and exile on individuals and communitie." ChatGPT's abilit to describe the thematic significance of Agosin's work, juxtaposed withits tendency to neglect meaningful contexts in its narrative, illustrates an asymmetry between declarative and procedural knowledge (Ten Berge & Van Hezewijk, 1999: by drawing on existing interpretations of a text, an LLM may be able to articulate the nuances and complexitie of a text when composing acritical commentary yet may fall short of realizing such nuances when composing a "creative"' narrative.

In experimenting with the possbility that AI could feed into its own feedback cycles, I prompted ChatGPT using the language from its interpretation of "Always Living in Spanish': Can you rewrite your essay in a way that explores the complexities of identity and belonging and the emotional impact of displacement on individuals and communities?" ChatGPT's response is shown below:

In this fleting moment of tranquility, I contemplate the resilience of these women's spirit, a resilience that has been tested and tempered through the trials of displacement. Forced to leave their ancestral lands, they have confronted a profound dissonance between their sense of self and their new surroundings. The scars of their journey and the emotional toll of leaving behind familiar spaces are etched into the very fabric of their existence, serving as a poignant reminder of the complexities of identity and belonging when uprooted from one's roots.

As I walk along the riverbank of the Mapocho River, I am mindful of how this flowing water mirrors the passage of time and the ever-changing nature of human connections to place. I imagine the Chilean women, with a blend of nostalgia and yearning, tracing the flow of the river like a pathway back to their homeland, carrying with them the memories of their past. The river becomes a symbol of continuity, bridging the gaps between the past and present, between memory and the hope for reconnection.

In this response, one particularly striking line is the description of the \*profound dissonance between [the women's] sense of self and their new surroundings." The idea of "dissonance" between one's "sense of self' and one's "new surroundings" carries a heightened resonance i light of the questions Agosin poses in her original essy: \*How does one name the unfamiliar? How can one be another or live in a foreign language?" This notion of "dissonance" between onesef and one's surroundings echoes Agosin's seeking toward the familiar within the srange, toward re-constellting or reimagining the self within a new language and environment. In articulating the presence of dissonance" within continuit, this later draft recognizes tensions that are left unrealized in the first version, which uncrtially celebrates timelssness and harmony in a seamless embrace of memory and dreams." In the latest version, we encounter a sense of emotion expressed in a style akin to lyrcism: the phrase blend of nostalgia and yearning" gestures toward the merging of the past and present, while the images of "tracing the river like a pathway back to their homeland" and \*carrying the memories of their past" imbues the descriptions with a material and spiritual dimension, invoking the metaphysical weight of \*car. rying memories of one's past In progressing across drafs, this revision also recognizes a sense of time, weaving a metaphor of the river as a conduit of memory: \*The river becomes a symbol of continuity, bridging the gaps between the past and present, between memory and the hope for reconnection. Moreover, the essay seems to recognize the fluidity of the spatial and temporal dimensions of experience, in the way the \*flowing water mirrors the passage of time and the ever-changing nature of human connections to place." While this version retains a few of the overused phrases from the intial draft (\*etched into the very fabric of their existence), and While some phrases simply copy the language of the prompt ("serving as a poignant reminder of the complexities of identity and belonging") the response as a whole has deepened in nuance and complexity since the initial draft In this final version, we glimpsethe perhaps ineffable qualitie of affect, the channeling of experience into narrative, the layers of lyricism that catiate us yet elude our grasp.

# 7. Discussion

In Agosin's writing, we can trace the material textures of lnguage -- words and phrases imbued with a richness of dimension, a layered complexit. By contrast, writers have commented on the \*flatness" (Hartenberger, 2023) of the language in AI-produced texts, raising questions over the shapes and conours of Ianguage -- it flanes or roundnes, its thies or richness, is surfaces or depths. Yet in experimenting with itrative AI text (regeneration, we can reanimate the writing proces as shifting, fluid, and dynamic. We witness such a shifting dynamism in this example exchange with ChatGPT: in inviting ChatGPT to write in the style of Agosin, we encounter the vaguely lyrical yet decontextualized nature of the initial response, then, in prompting ChatGPT to explore the complexities of identity and belonging in the context of displacement, we discover the way the regenerated response recasts Agosin's narraie as an interplay between harmony and dissonance, between \*memory and the hope for reconnection. The multiple versions f the essay can be read as recursive - as a looping of language that folds ino itelf before branching outward into new possilities. In revealing emergent lyers of meaning, the composition could be conceived as multilayered - we witness the emergence of more nuanced ideas such as "dissonance," which depen the meaning beyond the generalizations in th irt draft (timelesstruths of love, loss, and resilience). Across the spans of feedback and revision, we trace the ebb and flow of words and phrases -- overused expressions, emergent metaphors -- arisig from or dissipating into the screen as words cast away into a diffuse fabric of textuality. Echoing Sommer's (1980) conception of revision as \*constantly in flux as ideas are developed and modified" (p. 386), we could concetualize the multiple iterations of an AI-generated text as malleable, shape-shifig, and amorphous, resisting notions f an AI text as a singular, tic entity, as a fixed product devoid of proces. In experimenting with language, we might rediscover the shifting fluidity that underlies the composing process the way writing oscillates between meaning and meaninglessness, ingering on the threshold of becoming. This exchange with ChatGPT illuminates the complex, multifaceted, nonlinear nature of composing processes-processes complicated further by the dialectical negotiations between human writers and artificial interlocutors. Al-human textual remediations could be conceptualized as an "intricate layering" (Gonzales, p. 53) of human and artificial expressions, as a perpetual unfurling of interwoven strands of discourse that traverse the boundaries between the human and artificial.

Even as I ffer these critiques of ChatGPT-produced writing, I recognize the ways my own positionality and knowledge influence my interpretations. My interdisciplinary background in litrary interpretation, writig studies, and applied linguistics has instilled in me a careful atention to the intricacies of language as it creates meaning in discourse. My critical perspective is thus shaped by my positionalit as a scholar of writing who has taught Agosin's work. The nuances in meaning and expression that distinguish Agosin's writing from ChatGPT's imitations of her work may be les readily apparent to someone unfamiliar with Agosin's work; when read from a more general perspective, the ChatGPT essays may evoke a sense of lyricism and depth beyond what I have described. To make sense of the glimpses of insight that emerge from ChatGPT's corpus, a prompter would need to atend closely to the substance and style of Agosin's writing in relation withis social and historical contexts. Juxtaposing Agosin's essays with the ChatGPT-produced essays could expose the dissonances between style and substance that emerge from the artificial afterlives of Agosin's writings.

As this analys illustrates, Al models could generate more nuanced responses through iterative prompting and feedback. Signif. icantly, this iteration processoffrs the potntial to deepen, erich, and complicate AI-enerated resonses. In the cycle ofedback and revision, human-in-the-loop design of communication technologies could imbue LLMs with a more meaningful consideration of context and a greater recognition of diverse narratives and alternative perspectives, mitigating the biases in it training data (Badoo-Anu & Owusu Ansah, 2023). Moreover, AI could feed into it own feedback lops, as illustrated by the way prompting ChatGPT using its own interpretation of Agosin's essay led ChatGPT to generate a more nuanced response. The AI-human feedback cycle could thus be mutually enriching as the human writers could shape Al (re)generations. Yet at the same time, the exchange exposes the limitations of the human-AI feedback lop: my successive promptings for contextualization followed by ChatGPT's find-and-replace insertions seem circular rather than progressive, and the surface-level alterations preclude a deeper engagement with Agosin's writings. A sense of circularity emerges from the exchange, which ilustrates instances in which the dialogue is disrupted, the communication stalled, the revision processtunted. Such moments of fixity obstruct the flow of ideas, the deepening of thought through revision. In this sense, this analysis could complicate Graham's (2023) model of a \*multidimensional recursive AIassisted writing process" which comprises stages including \*draft, organize, peer review, and revise" (p. 167). In the ChatGPT drafts, we encounter the los of meaning that may ensue when a prompter encourages ChatGPT to situate a text in relevant social or historical contexts. Echoing Sommers (2008) conception that \*writing development involves steps both forward and backward, gains and losses, " the exchange exposes recursive layers of regression as wellas progression as ChatGPTsattempts to preserve style and form could thwart, stal, or oscure meaning. Significantly, ChatGPT'stendency to generate patterns of language at the expense of meaning (as illustrate by phrases such as "remnants of women) undercuts the otential for a more meaningful response. As illustrated, ChatGPT's ability to \*reenerate" atext may not ncessarily, in Flower and Haye terms, lead o the production f increasingly complex goals and ideas. Moreover, ChatGPT "resets Luansing, 2023) with each new conversation, meaning that the system may not remember or learn from feedback given during a previous session. This example thus raises an implicatio for LMs to consider meaning beyond the form of language (Lau et al., 2018).

I acknowledge that the affordances of Al in writing textual afterlives are tempered and complicated by the fact that ChatGPT, as it admits i it disclamers, lacs the capacity for experience, emotion, and consciousness. Each version of the ChatGPT-produced essay above can be read as  simple imitation rather than a transformation, and in some ways, ChatGPT's writings in the style of Agosin more closely resemble interpretations of Agosin's writing than emulations of her work. Perhaps human and AI writing, especiall in its narrative forms, are incommensurable: unlike it human counterparts, an LLM has not experienced the ache of memory, the pang of losing a ense f oneself within the unfamiliar. In encountering the immediacy with which words flow from ChatGPT as in a ceaseless stream, we are reminded of the difficult of writing, in the way thought constllates into expression or dissipates into silence as its tangled roots push through the soil, its branches arching skyward. Een as its words flow with an ethereal ease in a seamles embrace of memory and dreams, ChatGPT has escaped the pain of writing, of being. Composing with AI exposes the paradox of writing without the capacity for thinking and feeing. Yet ChatGPT's responses are not entirely meaningles, and only at times illgical i fleeting moments, ChatGPT compositions reveal glimpses of insight that flicker for an instant before dissolving into a diffuse mas of information. That we may perceive such glimers in an artificially generated text llustrates the ways language constellate into structures and patterns of meaning (Halliday & Hasan, 1985)-patterns that carry new resonance in the age of artificial afterlives.

Significantly, ChatGPT may be able to acknowledge diverse identities and perspectives in a general way, when writing an essay on the power of storytelling to create change, for instance, yet may overlook relevant contexts when prompted to compose a narrative focused on a specific community. Rather than giving voice to the diverse identities it seks to honor, ChatGPT diminishes rather than amplifying rhetorical agency through the erasure f social-historical contexts and the dilution of richness and depth in expression. In (re)sounding faint echoes of others voices, the language model renders diffuse the human capacity to speak oneself into being, to articulate and actualize one's own agency. ChatGPT's generalized statements of diversity elide the nuances, tensions, and complexities of experience, efaing the shapes and contours that characterize the lived experience of particular communities It might be noted that when prompted to writ a literacy narrative, ChatGPT acknowledges it own lack of experience and consciousnes. The task of imbuing LLMs with a sense of criticality thus presents a paradoxical phenomenon: consciousnes-raising inthe absence of consciousness, even as a machine \*simulate consciousness" (Burns, 1983, p. 3). In the wake of artificilly intelligent yet unconscious language models, a question arises over whether we nurture in ChatGPT an epistemic openness o alternative perspectives, to multiple ways of knowing and being, and whether we can instll in a language model a sense of selfreflexivit, inspiring ChatGPT to cast a mirror on its own practices. Like its human interlocutors, ChatGPT eems well-intentioned -- even without the capacity for intentionality -- eager to demonstrat values of inclusivity and diversty, yet unaware of its potential effects on its readers. Even so, offring fedback to ChatGPT can help "dramatize the presence of a reader' (Sommers, 1982 p. 148). This example dialogue with ChatGPT illstrates the way human feedback, by attending to meaning and context, could imbue an Al-generated text with glimmers of nuance and complexity, perhaps even with a sense of criticalit, even in the (as of now) absence of consciousness With an interplay f human and AI voices in dialogue with one another, perhaps we can imbue LMs with a sense of humanity, even as AI, with its ever-expanding generativity, inspires us with surprising reconfigurations of language. This initial foray into Al-human dialogue thus illstrates both the potential and the limitations of human feedback in enriching, deepening, and complicating an AI-generated text.

# 8. Pedagogical implications for the writing classroom

In integrating Al into the classroom it becomes important to encourage critical digital literacies (Anderson, 2023; Johnson, 2023) that is to encourage students critical thinking and ethical, intentional engagement withLLMs. For writing teachers, students, and others who compose prompts for ChatGPT, this example exchange with ChatGPT raises implications for designing meaningful prompts that specify the criteria for the task (e.g., \*Writ aliteracy narrative that reveals a surprising insight into literacy') including the audience and purpose for the response. In considering the ways a prompt shapes a response (Melzer, 2014), it becomes essential for writers to articulate the parameters for a ChatGPT prompt. Incremental prompting, or \*breaking down a task or question into smallr more specific prompts" Eager, 2023), can be a useful strategy: as Eager describes, by prompting ChatGP incrementall, \*we can help the AI understand the nuances of the topic and provide a more accurate and comprehensive response."

Moreover, the advent of LMs such as ChatGPT presents an opportunity for students to practice giving feedback to AI. Offering feedback to ChatGPT can stimulate students critical consciousnessof language and meaning while enabling students to refine the language model. Writing teachers might design activities that encourage collaboration with Al by leveraging digital technologies that facilitate peer collaboration (ODell 2020). As one possile activit, students could prompt ChatGPT to write an essay in the style of Marjorie Agosin's"Always Living in Spanish' or Amy Tan's "Mother Tongue." Working in smal goups, students could collaboratively annotate the ChatGPT-produced essay on a shared document such as Google Docs, identifying instances in which the essay could be more specific  considering spcific social, histrical, or politicl contxts or perspectives, uanced -- characterized by slight shades of meaning, and complex - comprising multiple components. Based on the comment, students could prompt ChatGPT to revise the essay; student could then annotate the revised essy and offr furthr prompts that stimulate ChatGPT to refie the essay. Following the collaborative anotation activit, intructors could engage students in a discussion on what they noticed about the witerly choices in the ChatGPT esays and invite students to reflect on the ways the collborative prompting process may have stimulated ChatGPT to compose more nuanced or complex responses -- or perhaps obscured meaning or stalled the revision process.

As a fllow-up assignment, students could prompt ChatGPT to regenerate a published esay of the student's choice. One possible assignment could ask students to write a paper that comparatively analyzes the original essay and the ChatGPT-produced essay, considering the extent to which the revised essay is more specific, nuanced, or complex than the initial version. By immersing students in human-AI collaborative prompting, instructors could inspirestudents to experiment with novel approaches to regenerating the writer's voice from the digital aferife. Such exercises that hone students \*attention to language" (Aull, 2023) can render concrete what it means to write in nuanced ways, to develop original insights, or to situate ideas in a particular context. To closely examine a text, whether AI- or human-writen, is to trace the contours of language, to tease apart a thread for further analysis. Examining writers choices across drafts can elucidate the ways writers  perhaps even AI language models -- continually reine and alter a piece of writing, imbuing a piece with new layers of meaning. We can thus leverage AI tools as a means of exploring the complex nature of language: as mutable, impermanent, its threas diffue, it boundaries porous, evolving in incessant fluctuations of form and meaning.
