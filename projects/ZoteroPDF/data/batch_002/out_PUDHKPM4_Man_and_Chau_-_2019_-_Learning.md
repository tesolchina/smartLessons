# Learning to evaluate through that-clauses: Evidence from a longitudinal learner corpus

The language of evaluation in academic writing has been increasingly studied. However, little is known about how students learn to make evaluative meanings. This article reports on a study of evaluative that-clauses based on a longitudinal corpus of 632 argumentative essays by 158 Chinese undergraduate students. The findings of the study show a non-linear trajectory of change in the use of evaluative that-clauses over time. It was found that the proportion of verb that-clauses decreased whereas the proportions of noun that-clauses and adjective that-clauses increased. Further, while the range of the lexical words co-occurring with evaluative that-clauses expanded, the authorial visibility in stance expression decreased. These changes indicate signs of agency and suggest that the development of evaluative language resources is an organic, dynamic process. Overall the study points to the value of developing and exploring longitudinal learner corpora for studying language learning in general and development in evaluative language in particular. Taking an approach to treating learner language in its own right, the study further contributes to a small but growing body of research based on an empowering ideology and to the empirical literature on evaluation and language learning. Implications for writing instruction are considered.

# 1.Introduction

The language of evaluation has been studied in academic discourse under various labels such as evaluation (Hunston, 1989, 2011; Hunston & Su, 2017; Hunston & Thompson, 2000), stance (Biber & Finegan, 1989; Conrad & Biber, 2000), metadiscourse (Hyland, 2005) and appraisal (Martin & White, 2005). The importance of evaluative language has aroused research interest in its use in student writing (e.g., Hong & Cao, 2014; Jiang, 2015; P. ) Thompson, 2012) and motivated scholarly attempts to investigate differences between second language (L2) and first language (L1) learner writing. There are, however, few studies which examine how students of English develop their linguistic resources over time to express evaluation.

This study, based on a longitudinal corpus, seeks to uncover how university students go about developing language resources based on that-clauses to convey evaluative meaning. The use of that-clauses has been found to be prevalent in academic writing: this linguistic feature serves an important means for expressing stance, defined here as the personal feelings, attitudes and value judgments conveyed by the speaker or writer (Biber, 2006; Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad, & Finegan, 1999; Groom, 2005; Hyland & Tse, 2005a, 2005b; Jiang & Hyland, 2015; Parkinson, 2013). The study shows that the developmental trajectories for evaluative that-clauses are not straightforward and that development in the use of evaluative language is more than just an increase in the employment of linguistic features over time. Learners also constantly engage in choice making in the selection of linguistic resources for communication as they develop more experience with language over the course of their studies.

# 2.Literature review

In English for Academic Purposes (EAP) studies, more and more scholars emphasize the importance of raising learners' awareness of linguistic markers of stance (Charles, 2006; Hong & Cao, 2014; Jiang & Hyland, 2016; Thomas, Thomas & Moltow, 2015; Zhang, 2015). For explicit instruction, for example, EAP teachers would find it helpful to be aware of the use of linguistic markers of stance in learner writing and how the use of these linguistic markers changes over time. Such awareness can help EAP teachers to conceptualize academic writing development, which is necessary for selecting the focus of explicit

instruction. As will be seen in this review, while past studies have offered insights into the use of stance markers in learner writing, development in the use of evaluative language remains to be an area largely overlooked in the literature.

# 2.1 Evaluative language in L2 writing

In corpus-based studies of linguistic features in L2 academic writing, there is considerable interest in comparing L2 learner texts against the texts written by expert academic writers. Hewings and Hewings (2002), for example, examined a corpus of published journal articles from the field of Business Studies and a corpus of MBA dissertations written by non-native speakers of English in their study of the use of clauses with an anticipatory $i t$ and extraposed subject (as in It is interesting to note that no solution is offered'). Parkinson (2013), on the other hand, compared the use of that-complement clauses in L1 Zulu students' reports and in journal articles for the expression of academic values. Studies of this kind usefully highlight the differences between native and non-native academic writing. The observed differences, however, may be understood in the light of the context in which academic texts are produced. Arguments may arise as to how unrealistic it is to compare L2 learners' writing against published research articles. Hyland and Milton (1997), for example, pointed out that journal articles have gone through rigorous reviews and revisions prior to publication. This is certainly not the case with many L2 texts produced as reports or dissertations at university level.

Another strand of research is to compare L2 learners with L1 learners, with learner factors (e.g., age and education level) and text characteristics (e.g., mode, genre and production condition) controlled. Following this approach, Adel (2006), for example, compared the use of metadiscourse in L1 Swedish university students' essays with those written by American and British native speaker (NS) university students. Jiang (2015), on the other hand, compared the use of noun that-complement clauses in argumentative essays written by L1 Chinese learners and in those produced by American NSs. In another study, Staples and Reppen (2016) compared the use of eight lexico-grammatical items in English for stance expression in the writing of two groups of L2 learners (Chinese and Arabic) and in the writing of NSs at a US university. The findings from these studies are generally consistent. First, L2 learners' writings exhibit some linguistic features characteristic of conversation (Gilquin & Paquot, 2008; Parkinson, 2013). Second, compared with L1 learners, L2 learners tend to use a more restricted range of linguistic items (Hyland & Milton, 1997; Jiang, 2015; Parkinson, 2013; Staples & Reppen, 2016) and overuse high-frequency linguistic items (Biber & Reppen, 1998; Larsson, 2016; see also Granger, 1998).

The rationale underlying the two approaches featured in previous studies is to uncover the extent to which L2 writing approximates expert-like or native-like usage. However, as Werner (2017) observes, the extent of approximation largely depends on the norm, or choice of norm, against which learner language is compared. If the reference point is different, the result of comparison would be different.

Further, from the perspective of multilingualism, it can be expected that many L2 learners simply do not use evaluative language the same ways as their native-speaker monolingual counterparts. For L2 learners that have different exposures to English, \*the next language learned is not a totally new entity but an additional component in a multilingual system in which the new system interacts with the components acquired earlier' (de Bot, Lowie, Thorne, & Verspoor, 2013, p. 201). It seems safe to assume that their meaningmaking resources would differ from those of their monolingual counterparts (see, e.g., Cook, 2007).

One important way to address concerns of the kind noted above, we argue, is to conduct longitudinal research on the same learners and observe changes in language use based on longitudinal evidence. All too often, the frequency of linguistic features observed in a corpus based on cross-sectional data, as opposed to longitudinal data, only shows learner performance at a particular point in time. If a major goal of writing instruction and research is to understand students' developmental writing practices, including their choices in language use, a longitudinal design would be essential.

# 2.2 Language development and L2 writing

Many studies on language development focused on complexity, accuracy and fluency (e.g., Biber, Gray & Staples, 2016; Knoch, Rouhshad, Oon, & Storch, 2015; Larsen-Freeman, 2006; Mazgutova & Kormos, 2015; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Yoon, 2017). These studies have offered valuable insights. The development of complexity, accuracy and fluency has been suggested to be a dynamic process that has a non-linear trajectory (Larsen-Freeman, 2006; Verspoor, Schmid, & Xu, 2012). During the developmental process, learner performance may progress or regress and sub-systems of language interact with each other

(de Bot et al., 2013; Larsen-Freeman, 2006). Additionally, some linguistic features are shown to be more reliable measures of language development than others. For instance, studies show that phrasal complexity features are better predictors of academic writing development than clausal complexity features (Biber, Gray & Poonpon, 2011; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Staples, Egbert, Biber, & Gray, 2016). Whereas the body of longitudinal research on complexity, accuracy and fluency continues to grow, few studies in this line of inquiry directly focus on how learners go about developing linguistic resources for meaning making.

In fact, a large body of SLA and learner corpus research is cross-sectional in nature (see Chau, 2012; Hasko, 2013; Ortega & Iberri-Shea, 2005). In SLA, for example, when longitudinal studies are conducted, the sample of participants tends to be small. Also, there is no strict control over the writing task (e.g., Morton & Llinares, 2016). As topics and individual differences can have a significant effect on writing performance (Lowie, van Dijk, Chan & Verspoor, 2017; Yang, Lu & Weigle, 2015), it is particularly important to track changes in language use among the same group of students with a controlled writing task.

This article reports on a longitudinal corpus study of evaluative that-clauses in Chinese EFL argumentative writing based on a common task. The questions to be addressed in the article are as follows:

1) How does the frequency of evaluative that-clauses in learner writing change over time?   
2) How does the degree of variability within evaluative that-clauses change over time?   
3) Does the change in the use of language resources based on that-clauses impact the way evaluative meanings are expressed in the text?

# 3. Method

3.1 Learner profile

A total of 158 Chinese EFL learners in their first semester studying at a Mainland China university participated in this study. Half of them were female and the other half male. They were all first-year students enrolled in a university course known as College Comprehensive English. The participants were classified as low-intermediate learners of English based on their performance in a standardized test as a sub-component of their college entrance examination. All the participants reported speaking Chinese as their first language and having learnt English as a compulsory subject in their secondary school for at least six years. Only one participant had experience studying as a visiting student in Australia for two months. During the study, all the participants enrolled in the English course taught by the same instructor. The course focused on listening, speaking, reading and writing skills for general purposes. During the course, the participants completed a variety of learning tasks, such as extensive reading, gap-filling exercises and making sentences with the words and phrases that had appeared in the teaching materials. No feedback or instruction was giyen to the students on the use of that-clauses in the course, which was conducted by the first author of the article. None of the participants majored in linguistics or reported enrolling in other English courses. Courses other than English were taught in Mandarin.

# 3.2 Corpus

The longitudinal corpus in the present study consists of timed argumentative essays written by the participants as described above. These essays were completed within sixty minutes under examination conditions. The participants performed the same writing task at four points in time, with a three-week interval in between. The topic of the controlled writing task is:

The Internet brings more harm than good to students. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

The corpus consists of 632 texts, with a total of 138,942 words. The details are described in Table 1. Each text is assigned a number and a letter for reference. The number range is 001-158, reflecting the number of students (158) who participated in the research. Four letters (i.e., a, b, c and d) were used to indicate the four different points in time (i.e., Time 1, Time 2, Time 3 and Time 4) when the text was produced. Thus, 001a and 001b, for example, refer to the texts written by the same student (001) at Time 1 and Time 2, and 023c and 095d refer to the texts written by different students (023 and 095, respectively) at Time 3 and Time 4.

# <<Insert Table 1 near here>>

Among the most structurally complex grammatical devices used to express stance in English is the that-clause, a grammatical structure consisting of two components: one presenting a proposition and the other presenting a stance towards that proposition (Biber et al., 1999, p. 969). This grammatical structure has great evaluative potential in that the evaluated entity, evaluative stance and evaluative source embedded can be controlled to construct evaluative meanings (Charles, 2006; Hyland & Tse, 2005a, 2005b; Parkinson, 2013), as illustrated in the following sentences taken from the longitudinal learner corpus:

(1) And we [Evaluative source] can't ignore the fact [Evaluative stance] that internet has been brought our a lot of convenient [Evaluated entity]. (033d) It [Evaluative source] is very important [Evaluative stance] that students can study in the Internet [Evaluated entity]. (006d) I [Evaluative source] believe [Evaluative stance] that the Internet can help us finish the work quickly [Evaluated entity]. (051d)

This structure creates space for writers to overtly express their evaluative stance by offering them a range of predicates, including verbs (2), nouns (3) and adjectives (4) (Biber et al., 1999; Hyland & Tse, 2005b):

(2) So some people think that the Internet brings more harm than good to students. (139d) So, I insist that the development of the internet get more benefits than harm to students. (071d) A growing number of people realize that the Internet is indispenable to a life. (067d)

(3) It is no doubt that the Internet has changed our life and made our life more and more convenient. (063c) And we can't ignore the fact that internet has been brought our a lot of convenient, everyone is closely related to internet. (033d) I can't hold the same opinion that the Internet brings more harm than good to students. (148d)

(4) It is clear that the Internet can help us solve this problem. (120c) Last, it is most important that education can reap the benefits of the Internet. (153d) It is undeniable that Internet is essential our life. (013d)

The choice of predicate forms in evaluative that-clauses varies across registers. While verb predicates are extremely common in conversation and relatively rare in academic prose, noun predicates are extremely rare in conversation and moderately common in academic prose (Biber et al., 1999, p. 984).

The grammatical subject of the predicates indicates the source of evaluation. The subject can be moved to the position following the original predicate or be replaced by $i t$ as subject (Hyland & Tse, 2005b). The possibility of extraposition allows writers to choose the attribution of stance, which can be presented in an explicit, implicit or ambiguous manner. Writers can also choose to attribute the stance to themselves to show high level of authorial visibility or conceal the source of stance to create a sense of objectivity.

# 3.4 Analytical procedures

Instances of evaluative that-clauses were all retrieved from the corpus with the assistance of AntConc. Unlike studies of research writing (Charles, 2006; Hyland & Tse, 2005a, 2005b), the present study considers the case of zero that, as follows:

(5) I think internet is one of the most important things. (001a) Experts said internet have all kinds of informations. (052b) I feel the Internet library is very good. (113d)

Zero that-clauses are considered for two reasons. First, L2 learner writing is shown to possess characteristics of conversations (Gilquin & Paquot, 2008), in which there is a heavy reliance on that-complement clauses to mark stance, typically with that omitted (Biber et al., 1999, p. 984). Second, $46 \%$ of verb that-clauses in the study omitted the complementizer that.

To retrieve all the zero-that instances, we searched in the corpus for the most commonly used verbs in zero-that structures.

After that-clauses were all extracted from the corpus, a manual analysis was conducted to exclude instances that are not used as stance markers. It should be emphasized that only those evaluative that-clauses that occur at least in two texts in the respective subcorpus were included for analysis. This practice is to eliminate potential idiosyncrasy. The remaining clauses were further categorized and coded according to the degree of explicitness of attribution (i.e., explicit, implicit or ambiguous) with MAXQDA Pro 12. The resulting frequency of that-clauses at Time 1 and Time 4 was then compared with the log-likelihood and effect size calculator (accessible at http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/llwizard.html).

# 4. Results

The results show a significant increase in the total number of evaluative that- clauses $( p < . 0 5 )$ (see Table 2) from Time 1 to Time 4. While there is a statistically significant increase in the number of noun that-clauses $( p < . 0 1 )$ and adjective that-clauses $( p < . 0 1 )$ , the increase in the number of verb that-clauses is not statistically significant $( p > . 0 5 )$

<<Insert Table 2 near here>>

4.1 Predicate forms of evaluative that-clauses

The normalized frequency of evaluative that-clauses increased from 109.6 to 126.0 per 10,000 words (see Figure 1). The normalized frequency of noun that-clauses increased consistently whereas the trajectory for verb that-clauses and adjective that-clauses went through some fluctuations. The fluctuation is most obvious in the use of verb that-clauses. The frequency of verb that-clauses first decreased at Time 2, then increased at Time 3 and decreased again at Time 4. The overall frequency of all evaluative that-clauses has a similar trajectory with that of verb that-clauses.

# <<Insert Figure 1 near here>>

As can be seen from Figure 2, the proportion of different types of that-clauses underwent changes over time. On the whole, the proportion of verb that-clauses, for example. decreased (from $9 0 . 7 \%$ to $7 9 . 8 \%$ ) whereas the proportions of noun that-clauses and adjective that-clauses increased (from $7 . 7 \%$ to $1 4 . 5 \%$ and from $1 . 6 \%$ to $5 . 7 \%$ , respectively). The trajectories for verb that-clauses and noun that-clauses appear to be straightforward. The trajectory for adjective that-clauses, however, slightly decreased after it reached its peak at $6 . 0 \%$ . The findings based on Figures 1 and 2 indicate that the development of linguistic resources associated with the use of that-clauses in academic writing is dynamic and complex (cf., Larsen-Freeman, 2006). It is dynamic because the overall trajectory is not straightforward and complex because the interaction between and among types of thatclauses changes across different points in time.

<<Insert Figure 2 near here>>

A closer look at the data reveals more interesting findings about students' development in academic writing. As can be seen from Table 3 which presents findings concerning lexis co-occurring with that-clauses at Time 1 and Time 4, the learners first relied heavily on a small set of verbs (e.g., think, believe, say) and nouns (e.g., opinion, no doubt) as the controlling words to express stance at Time 1. Over time, their use of controlling verbs as part of their linguistic resources in academic writing has expanded. This is evidenced in the longer list of both verbs and nouns used at Time 4, where a greater number of different types of verbs and nouns were observed. At this later point in time, too, adjectives were seen to form part of the learners' linguistic repertoires to express stance with that-clauses:

(6) I believe it is important that we tell him how to do. (155d) It is well-known that the delveopment of the Internet is a smoybol of progress. (126d) Although the Internet brings more harm to students, it is undeniable that the Internet can also brings some good for students. (023d)

In addition, the choice of lexis was becoming more academic-like. Words like tell and remember, for example, were observed in the writing at Time 1, but they were no longer used with that-clauses at Time 4 (7); At Time 4, new words such as realize and suggest became the preferred controlling words for that-clauses (8):

(7) She tell me that Internet let she know much knowledge about world that is the book can't give she. (040a) So in order to change his mind, we always tell him that he shoud stop to doing this, don't playing the computer game so crazy. (065a) I still remember that I had been lost in many mate problems. (051a)

(8) Today, a growing number of people realize that internet is indispensable to their life. (046d) But people are beginning to realize that the Internet has exerted a negative impact on our life. (048d) Some people suggest that the Internet brings us a lot of benefits. (009d)

# 4.2 Source of stance in evaluative that-clauses

In argumentative writing, the source of stance plays a crucial role in persuading readers. The source of stance can be concealed to create a sense of objectivity or be highlighted to add credit. Usually, the grammatical subject of the main clause holds responsibility for the stance towards the proposition made in a that-complement clause. The subject can also be extraposed to the position following the original predicate or be removed.

<<Insert Figure 3 near here>>

In the study, the proportion of that-clauses with explicit stance sources decreased over time, from $9 5 . 4 \%$ at Time 1 to $7 9 . 1 \%$ at Time 4 (see Figure 3). In contrast, the proportion of that-clauses with implicit and ambiguous stance sources increased. The curves for implicit and ambiguous that-clauses are not straightforward.

One surprising observation is that while the frequency of noun that-clauses and adjective that-clauses increased, some of these syntactic structures attribute stance explicitly by using the personal pronoun as the subject of the superordinate clause:

(9) I hold the view that the Internet brings more benefits to us. (102b) But I hold the belief that the Internet brings more harm than good to students. (027c) I draw a conclusion that the Internet brings more good than harm to students. (097d)

This is a feature that emerged at a later point of development (i.e., Time 2, Time 3 and Time 4). At Time 1, all the twenty noun that-clauses conceal the source of stance. But at Time 2, four noun that-clauses attribute stance to personal pronouns, accounting for $1 9 . 2 \%$ of all the twenty-six noun that-clauses. The percentage dropped to $8 . 2 \%$ at Time 3, where four out of forty-nine noun that-clauses made use of the personal pronoun as the subject of the superordinate clause. This percentage, however, increased at Time 4, where nine out of fiftysix noun that-clauses attribute stance to personal pronouns, amounting to $1 6 . 1 \%$ of the total number of noun that-clauses. This suggests how the learners are diversifying their linguistic means to make similar meanings.

# 4.3 Evaluative meaning making with that-clauses

In written communication, writers acknowledge alternative views so that they can create space for negotiation of their stance with the reader (G. Thompson, 2001). In the present study, we find that learners presented conflicting views by manipulating the grammatical subject of the superordinate clauses. At Time 1, for instance, students used the third person pronoun to bring in alternative voices:

(10) People also worry the compute is bad for their eyes and body and so on. So more and more people think that the Internet brings more harm than good to student. But I still disagree with this opinion... (007a) Someone think the Internet brings more harm than good to students, but I don't think so. (018a) Some people say that Internet brings harm to teenagers. (152a)

In these examples, included in the text is a voice that could be attributed to the reader. What the writers are doing is to bring in alternative views and then contradict them. There are also examples that writers used a third-party source to support their own stance:

(11) I remember Hawkim says that human depend on the AI. I agree him opinion, because human difficult to give up Internet. (003a) In my opinion, the internet brings more good than harm to students. For example, University students do homework use internet more than writing without anything. Experts said internet have all kinds of informations. (052b) A study found that some students play computer games day and night, as a result, they fail to their exam. So we must use Internet in a true way. (079c)

From these examples, it can be seen that the students select different grammatical subjects to express their evaluative meanings. To acknowledge alternative views, they use subjects such as someone and some people, whereas to support their own stance, they use grammatical subjects such as Hawkim, expert and a study that could give credit to the source of information. This use of evaluative language also appears at Time 4:

(12) Someone think Internet makes us corrupt. But I think Internet is a bridge. (001d) A great number of people think that the Internet will harm their children, but the Internet must be more and more important that no one can leave it. (016d) But other people think that the Internet brings more harm than good to students. A growing number of student feel that the computer online games indispensable to them. It is estimated that more and more students are addicted to online games. (126d)

At Time 1 and Time 2, the nouns controlling that-clauses were mostly those that represent ideas and beliefs such as opinion, belief, point and thinking:

(13) I disagree with this opinion that the Internet brings more harm than good to students. (096a) It is my thinking that Internet give great help for my study and my job in the future. (153a) A group of people who have the same interests that have the stronger belief that you are able to do things well. (087b)

In contrast, at Time 4, learners used nouns that represent objectivity and evidence to control that-clauses:

(14) Despite the fact that the internet has some negative aspects, but we have to recognize it let our life and study better. (008d) Now, it's a truth that the human can't live in a world without the Internet. (088d) It is hard to deny the fact that Internet becomes more and more important in our life. (156d)

Overall, the argumentative writing produced by the participating students is found to be increasingly conforming to conventions of academic writing over time. The way that stance is expressed has become less explicit, though the process of change is not straightforward. While the percentage of explicit stance expression decreased from Time 1 to Time 4, the development went through some fluctuation in between. More interestingly, the use of noun that-clauses has increased over time, suggesting that students now place greater emphasis on constructing objectivity and evidence in persuading their readers.

# 5.Discussion

The results suggest that the changes in both the frequency and proportion of evaluative thatclause and its structural variants are complex and dynamic. The fluctuations observed in the trajectories indicate that development in the expression of evaluation is not only about an increase in the use of specific linguistic features over time. As learners develop more experience with language over the course of their studies, the development is also about making choices in the selection of linguistic resources for communication. Similarly, the degree of explicitness to which evaluative meanings are made has been observed to change across different points in time in a rather non-linear manner, suggesting learners' fluid use of their developing linguistic resources that are constantly adjusted and reorganized to meet the demands of written communication.

As far as co-occurring lexis is concerned, we found a lexical teddy bear' tendency in our study (Hasselgren, 1994, p.237): The learners initially depended on a small set of verbs and nouns as the controlling words to express stance. This finding seems to be in line with previous research which suggests that learners tend to rely heavily on a small set of linguistic items (Biber & Reppen, 1998; Hyland & Milton, 1997; Larsson, 2016; Parkinson, 2013; Staples & Reppen, 2016). Over time, however, not only was a wider range of verbs and nouns observed, adjectives as a new category of linguistic resources that co-occur with thatclauses were also seen to occur in their writing. Also, while Parkinson (2013) finds that controlling verbs for evaluative that-clauses in learner writing are more reflective of vocabulary use in conversation, this study observed an increase in the use of controlling verbs over time that are more characteristic of academic writing. The choice of lexis among the learners in this study, as noted above, was becoming more academic-like. These findings further confirm the value of longitudinal research: while previous cross-sectional research such as Hyland (2005b) and Parkinson (2013) is helpful in identifying problematic' use of evaluative that-clauses in L2 learner writing, the present study sheds light on how learners' use of this stance marker changes over time and reveals signs of agency in academic writing development.

It must be pointed out that although the overall frequency of evaluative that-clauses increased over time, the frequency of some structural variants fluctuated across different points in time. This is particularly noticeable in the case of verb $^ +$ that-clauses. The frequency of noun and adjective $^ +$ that-clauses also went through some fluctuation, but to a lesser extent. These findings provide evidence for a dynamic perspective on language development (de Bot et al., 2013; Larsen-Freeman, 2006). Further, verb that-clauses are arguably acquired in earlier points of development as a linguistic feature of conversation (see also Biber & Gray, 2010). Over time, learners develop alternative language resources (other than verb that-clause) for stance expression.

Meanwhile, in noun that-clauses, placing personal pronouns as the grammatical subject of the superordinate clause seems to be an emerging feature of Chinese student writing in this study. This is, to some'extent, consistent with Jiang's (2015) finding that Chinese EFL learners tend to be personally involved in expressing their stance:

(15) I have a idea that the Internet brings more good than harm to student. (104d) I have a opinion that we not only make the most of the Internet resours but also reduse students are influented the harmful resours. (126d) So, I insist on my view that the Internet bring more good than harm to student. (145d)

The learners were also observed at Time 1 to use the grammatical subject of the superordinate to develop their argument. They acknowledged possible alternative views and contradicted them or supported their own stance by quoting from third-party sources (see examples in Section 4.3). It is possible that learners at undergraduate level already have these meaning-making resources in their L1. As Bardovi-Harlig (2014, p.128) points out, adult ESL/EFL learners have access to \*the full range of semantic concepts from their previous linguistic and cognitive experience". Further research on how undergraduate students make use of their previous experience in stance expression is warranted, however.

The explicitness of meaning expressed in the student writing is found to have decreased over time as the range of linguistic resources expanded. At Time 1, for example, all stances were explicitly or implicitly attributed. At Time 4, however, the learners used grammatical devices that conceal the source of stance. The instances of implicit attribution also increased in terms of normalized frequency. Such changes indicate that learners began to refrain from making subjective judgment and started to construct language that reflects greater objectivity. As academic writing has been argued to be less explicit than conversation (Biber & Gray, 2010), the reduced explicitness indicates that the students were over time producing texts that are more characteristic of formal writing. This finding complements the research by Hyland and Tse (2005b) on the use of evaluative that-clauses in abstracts from postgraduate dissertations and journal articles. They found that L2 postgraduate students were more reluctant to use personal voice than scholarly writers. Taken together, all this suggests that in learning how to evaluate, student writers appear to progress from being relatively explicit in stance expression to becoming less explicit as they go through their undergraduate years and into postgraduate-level study. For some of them who go on pursuing an academic career in their later lives, they may start developing or showing a more authorial voice or authorial presence in their writing. This hypothesized developmental progression of course remains to be confirmed in future research.

A number of limitations of this study may be noted. First and most obvious of all, the period of the study only spanned 11 weeks of one semester of study. Ideally, a longitudinal study of language development would span over a year or two for the researcher to observe substantial changes (see, e.g., Ortega, 2003). For practical reasons, however, this was not possible in this study. Nevertheless, in the light of the findings of our study, it is important to note that even a study with as short a duration as 11 weeks like the present one surprisingly yielded results that reveal noticeable changes in the use of linguistic resources over time. This points to the possibility then that the duration or time that is required to observe linguistic changes may vary, depending on the linguistic features under examination. As linguistic items grow organically, as evidenced in this study, it can be argued that there is no 'standard' timeframe that applies to all linguistic investigations.

Second, the present study is essentially a corpus study investigating patterns of linguistic resources used over time to express evaluative meaning. It is beyond the scope of this study to consider such issues as the role of input or feedback in changing the ways language is used, important though such factors are. Neither has the concern been addressed of individual student development and variability in individual performance. Future research might consider this and other issues such as whether and to what extent there would be differences in results between using the same task and different tasks over time in studies that investigate language development.

It should be pointed out that the repeated-task design used in this study reflects the need for a controlled writing task for a common group of students, who were also interested in knowing their changing language use over time. As noted before, the use of different topics can have a significant effect on writing performance and may affect the extent of comparability of texts written by the same students over time. Future research could potentially build upon the findings from this study by using a similarly controlled method to track learners' written (or spoken) output over longer periods of time and by observing whether learners' use of other features of academic discourse in their language output over time follows a similarly non-linear trajectory,

A final important point to make is a direct response to what a reviewer has commented:

.. as an EAP writing instructor, I find it somewhat surprising that you didn't observe or comment on changes in accuracy over time (i.e. where these structures were being formed more or less in a grammatically correct way over time). Perhaps this is beyond the scope of the study, but I think it is still worth mentioning.

We must first make it clear that not only do we welcome this comment; we appreciate having the opportunity to engage in this dialogue. The present study focuses on students' development in evaluative meaning making: it is indeed not concerned with changes in accuracy in the student writing (e.g., does the writing become more grammatically correct over time?). This is not because it is beyond the scope of our study; it has to do with the position we adopt. Our position is that learner language is a variety of human language that is to be respected in its own right and that language learning is an organic process that requires no comparison with an external point of reference, idealized or otherwise (Chau, 2015). Space concerns do not allow for a good discussion of this issue; for now, we would just note that learner language is not an imperfect version of native-speaker competence or

performance. It is not even a thing $\mathit { \check { \Psi } } :$ It is a process (see also Garcia & Wei, 2014; LarsenFreeman, 2006).

Further, like World Englishes or English as a (multi)lingua franca (see Jenkins, 2018; Mauranen, 2018; Seidlhofer, 2012), how learner language is to be studied or perceived, we argue, should go beyond superficial concerns for mere linguistic features: issues of ideology and identity need to be considered, so are learners' intentions and capabilities. A study based on accuracy would inevitably involve a specific external norm, which is against the whole idea of treating learner language in its own right (Selinker, 1972). We hope that the position we hold, together with the methodology we use (studying longitudinal learner data without recourse to native speaker data, involving no comparison with an idealized competence and embracing interpretations of findings based on what is present in the data, not based on a monolingual ideology), represents a conscious choice: a choice based on an empowering ideology that shows our commitment to what Ortega (2018, p.75) has called a "project of reconceptualizing linguistic development under non-essentialist lenses". We exemplify both the position and approach in this study, and we hope that more studies in EAP, learner corpus research, SLA, second language writing and ELT/TESOL will be conducted with a similar respect for learners and learner language (i.e., involving no comparison with an external point of reference and reflecting no introduction of monolingual bias). EAP instructors who are interested in knowing and developing alternative ways of teaching language without accuracy in mind may refer to Pallotti (2017) for useful insights and examples.

# 6. Conclusion

The article has reported on a longitudinal study of undergraduate students' argumentative writing, highlighting the value of developing and exploring longitudinal learner corpora for studying development in evaluative language. It seeks to understand whether and to what extent linguistic resources based on that-clauses change over time and how this might impact the expression of evaluative meaning. A number of observations have been made. First, the results show that the frequency of evaluative that-clauses increased significantly and that the range of the lexical words co-occurring with that-clauses expanded. Second, there is considerable variability in the use of evaluative that-clauses. Specifically, the proportion of verb that-clauses decreased whereas the proportion of adjective and noun thatclauses increased. Further, the changing use of that-clauses has an impact on the evaluative meanings conveyed by the learners. As discussed above, the explicitness of stance marking decreased as the learners used more adjective that-clauses and noun that-clauses. The manner in which learners expressed their stance became more characteristic of academic writing. Overall then, it seems clear that the developmental trajectories for evaluative that-clause and its structural variants were not straightforward, suggesting that the development of evaluative language is an organic, dynamic process, with lexis and grammar interacting with each other to co-construct meanings.

What does all this suggest to the writing teacher? First, an appreciation for yiewing language development as a dynamic process is important. Both the increase and the decrease in the use of specific linguistic items might not be simply taken to suggest one's language ability. In assessing students' academic writing, for example, the complex interplay between and amongst different language resources might require closer attention. As shown in this study, the decreased use of a specific linguistic item can be a matter of choice rather than a matter of regression. In such a case, simply opting for more conventional forms of corrective feedback might not always be the best option. In fact, this would enact and reinforce a monolingual worldview, as briefly noted above. Second, the changing use of linguistic items as the controlling lexis for that-clauses suggests that L2 learners are expanding their evaluative meaning-making resources. It would be helpful for instructors to raise their students' awareness about what makes appropriate choices in different contexts of language use and expose students to linguistic choices that are characteristic of academic writing in specific contexts.

A final note: the discussion in the article raises a central issue for EAP instructors: what are the expected outcomes of EAP teaching and how to assess such outcomes? In this study, for example, when changes in language use are considered based on averaged group performance, a complex picture of language development emerges. Taking into account individual differences among students in the classroom would further complicate the situation. On the one hand, imposing a unified, fixed standard of assessment would show little respect for learners; on the other hand, assessing the learning outcomes on an individual basis would almost be impractical. An important question to ask is if we are truly concerned with treating learner language in its own right, what learning outcomes can be reasonably expected? Or is there no target to begin with in the first place? Also, if language learning is to drive both the teaching and assessment practice, how do we go about addressing concerns of institutional demands? There are no easy answers to these questions, but we hope that these questions

invite a critical reflection upon the nature and goals of language learning, and encourage a reassessment of our practices in EAP instruction.
