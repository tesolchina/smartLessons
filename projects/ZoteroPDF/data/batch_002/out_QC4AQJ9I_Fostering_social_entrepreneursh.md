# ABSTRACT

Since the introduction of the Sustainable Development Goals, social entrepreneurship has received increasing attention from governments and universities. This study evaluated antecedents of social entrepreneurial intentions (SEI), including perceived social awareness among peers, social responsibility, perceived social support, outcome expectations of social entrepreneurship and digital literacy. The role of entrepreneurial creativity in moderating these relationships was also explored. A closed-ended questionnaire was administered to gather data from undergraduate and postgraduate students in Taiwan. The responses of 303 participants were analysed. Results indicated that perceived social awareness among peers, perceived social support, and digital literacy positively influenced SEI. Entrepreneurial creativity was revealed to positively moderate the relationships between outcome expectations of social entrepreneurship and SEI, between social responsibility and SEI, between perceived social support and SEI, and between digital literacy and SEI. These results are useful for policymakers and universities helping students become social entrepreneurs.

# Introduction

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the United Nations directed public attention towards social entrepreneurship (Ip and Liang 2023). Governments and educators are striving to foster engagement in and support for social entrepreneurship. Taiwan’s government established the Social Innovation Lab in 2017 and introduced a social innovation action plan in 2018 to enhance the public’s understanding and awareness of social innovation and entrepreneurship. Social entrepreneurship modules and programmes are being introduced to enhance students’ interest in social entrepreneurship (Ip 2024). Because entrepreneurship education is an essential tool for accelerating the growth of business ventures (Duong 2022), investigation is required to identify effective measures for developing skills to alleviate social problems and manage businesses, thereby facilitating social entrepreneurship.

Studies on determinants of entrepreneurial or social entrepreneurial intentions (SEI) have mainly employed the theory of planned behaviour (Farrukh et al. 2019; Hockerts 2017; Ip et al. 2021), which involves attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. Although the theory of planned behaviour provides a theoretical framework and has been tested in prior research, several variables have been reported to be nonsignificant predictors in specific contexts. For example, several studies have reported nonsignificant or contradictory results regarding the effect of various proxies of subjective norms on entrepreneurial intentions (Al-Mamary et al. 2020; Esfandiar et al. 2019; Hockerts 2017). Researchers should clarify why the direct effects of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control on intentions have been nonsignificant. Studies have suggested that these relationships are moderated by variables such as university support, entrepreneurship education, social support, and sustainability orientation (Anjum et al. 2023; Duong 2022; Ip and Liang 2023; Younis et al. 2021). To develop proposals for social entrepreneurship curricula, social support must be fostered, favourable attitudes towards social entrepreneurship must be established, and the key elements which can moderate the relationship between social support and favourable attitudes must be identified.

Although entrepreneurial creativity is a key predictor of entrepreneurial intentions (Laguía, Moriano, and Gorgievski 2019; Shahab et al. 2019; Smith, Sardeshmukh, and Combs 2016), the role of entrepreneurial creativity as a moderator has not been thoroughly tested. Entrepreneurial creativity strongly affects the entrepreneurial process because it facilitates the identification and exploitation of business opportunities (Entrialgo and Iglesias 2020; Liu et al. 2021). Social entrepreneurship benefits from favourable attitudes and social support; however, a lack of entrepreneurial creativity can impede the promotion of social enterprises and the creation of competitive products or services. This hinders the transformation of favourable attitudes into SEI. For social entrepreneurs who strive to remove social, economic, and environmental barriers to venture survival and sustainability (Liu et al. 2021), the positive moderation of entrepreneurial creativity is particularly crucial. In consideration of these findings, this study investigated the following research questions (RQ).

RQ1. Do outcome expectations, perceived social awareness among peers, social responsibility, perceived social support, and digital literacy directly affect SEI?

RQ2. What role does entrepreneurial creativity play in the aforementioned effects?

The major objectives of this research are (1) to evaluate the direct effects of outcome expectations, perceived social awareness among peers, social responsibility, perceived social support, and digital literacy on SEI; (2) to investigate the moderation of entrepreneurial creativity on these effects; and (3) to provide governments and educators with suggestions for fostering social entrepreneurship.

# Literature review

Social entrepreneurship is the practice of combining economic activities with social purposes to improve the social well-being of communities; it involves creating self-sustaining ventures that generate revenue and identifying innovative solutions for social problems (Kamaludin, Xavier, and Amin 2024; Tan, Le, and Xuan 2020). SEI refers to the self-acknowledged conviction of an individual who intends to establish a new social enterprise with a social mission (Ip et al. 2021). When behaviours are rare or difficult to monitor (e.g. social entrepreneurship), understanding intentions can provide additional insights into the processes underlying engagement in these behaviours (Bazan et al. 2020; Krueger, Reilly, and Carsrud 2000; Urban 2020).

The theory of planned behaviour signifies that attitudes, perceived behavioural control, and subjective norms influence behavioural intentions (Ajzen 1991). These variables have also been identified as predictors of entrepreneurial intentions (e.g. Duong 2022; Wach et al. 2023). Instead of explicitly incorporating these variables, Mair and Noboa (2006) and Hockerts (2017) acknowledged the unique nature of social entrepreneurship and suggested that empathy can represent attitude, social entrepreneurial self-efficacy can represent internal perceived behavioural control, perceived social support can reflect external perceived behavioural control, and moral obligation can reflect subjective norms. Other studies have adopted similar models to identify proxies for attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control (e.g. Ip 2024; Rambe and Ndofirepi 2021). Moreover, their perspective of external perceived behavioural control emphasises the tangible resources and opportunities that directly affect an individual’s capacity to engage in social entrepreneurial activities (Hockerts 2017; Mair and Noboa 2006). Because social support implies an availability of resources and plays a crucial role in enabling the execution of entrepreneurial behaviours, it aligns more closely with the notion of external perceived behavioural control (Hockerts 2017; Mair and Noboa 2006). By contrast, subjective norms are related to the perceived social pressure to perform or not perform a behaviour (Ajzen 1991), and therefore, they are more related to conformity to social expectations and the desire to comply with the perceived wishes of significant others (e.g. relatives and friends) than to the tangible support and resources that significant others provide. Because socially aware peers can provide and share information regarding social problems, they potentially shape an individual’s perceptions of how much their significant others approve of their engagement in social entrepreneurship (Ip 2024). In alignment with this perspective, this study identifies perceived social support as a proxy of external perceived behavioural control and perceived social awareness among peers as a proxy for subjective norms.

Various studies (Aloulou and Algarni 2022; Ip et al. 2018; Ip et al. 2021; Ukil 2022) have investigated how SEI are influenced by empathy, outcome expectations (representing attitude), social entrepreneurial self-efficacy, perceived social support, and moral obligation. Although perceived social support is a crucial predictor of SEI (Ip et al. 2021; Liu et al. 2019), several studies reported that the positive influences of empathy, outcome expectations, self-efficacy, and moral obligation on intentions are nonsignificant. For example, the effect of empathy on SEI was reported to be nonsignificant among students from Bangladesh (Ashraf 2021; Ukil 2022), whereas the direct effect of entrepreneurial outcome expectations on entrepreneurial intentions was reported to be weak or nonsignificant in several studies (Ip et al. 2021; Luc 2020; Santos and Liguori 2020). Some studies have revealed that social entrepreneurial self-efficacy and moral obligation have marginal or nonsignificant effects on SEI (Aloulou and Algarni 2022; Aure et al. 2019; Hockerts 2017; Ip et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2019; Rambe and Ndofirepi 2021). These results indicate the necessity of identifying alternative proxies of subjective norms and internal perceived behavioural control, as well as investigating the potential reasons for these contradictory results (i.e. testing a moderating variable).

This study used outcome expectations, the consequences and efficacy of social entrepreneurship in alleviating social problems (Ip et al. 2021), as a proxy of attitudes. If an individual forms favourable expectations regarding entrepreneurial outcomes (e.g. meaningful and rewarding outcomes), they tend to become more interested in establishing a venture (Duong et al. 2023; Santos and Liguori 2020). In addition, before starting a social venture, an individual should consider social entrepreneurship as an effective measure for alleviating social problems; otherwise, they tend to adopt other measures, such as donating to a charity (Ip et al. 2021; Ip and Liang 2023). Moreover, other studies have revealed a positive effect of outcome expectations on SEI (Aure et al. 2019; Luc 2023; Pham et al. 2022).

H1: Outcome expectations positively affect SEI.

This study used social responsibility and the perceived social awareness among peers as proxies of subjective norms. Social responsibility is an individual’s belief about whether a firm should fulfil ethical responsibilities to promote the welfare of stakeholders, and would be influenced by stakeholders (Ip et al. 2021). Scholars have proposed the use of social responsibility beliefs instead of moral obligation in representing subjective norms; they have claimed that moral obligation is irrelevant in the business context and that social responsibility is closely related to business and management (Ip et al. 2018; Wurthmann 2013). Researchers have indicated that social responsibility strengthens SEI; that is, social entrepreneurs who are socially responsible are more likely to pursue social well-being and emphasise the importance of venture sustainability (Peng and Liang 2019). Moreover, other studies have revealed a positive effect of social responsibility on SEI (Yu and Wang 2019; Zainol et al. 2023).

The perceived social awareness among peers is the extent to which an individual perceives that their peers are aware of community and government policies (Dinev and Hart 2005; Ip 2024), and it is a suitable proxy for subjective norms because it indicates the potential influence of others. Entrepreneurship knowledge and values can be transmitted by significant others because they can facilitate the generation of useful ideas pertaining to social entrepreneurship and social problems, which lead to more favourable evaluations of social entrepreneurship (Liñán and Chen 2009; Naznen, Al Mamun, and Rahman 2023). If the friends of an individual are aware of social issues, the individual may become more socially aware because their friends may share knowledge with them and encourage them to contribute to society. For example, the peers may discuss social issues with the individual and invite the individual to volunteer in the community. These experiences can help the individual acquire knowledge about social problems, thereby strengthening their ability to identify and utilise opportunities for social entrepreneurship (Roslan et al. 2022). Moreover, a study has revealed a positive effect of perceived social awareness among peers on SEI (Ip 2024).

H3. Perceived social awareness among peers positively affects SEI.

Digital literacy – the ability to adopt digital platforms, artefacts, and infrastructure to support business operations (Neumeyer, Santos, and Morris 2021) – is a proxy of internal perceived behavioural control. Because digital literacy facilitates a business’s communication with stakeholders and its analyses of market trends, it is central to the performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (Sariwulan et al. 2020). Digital literacy is also crucial for identifying and exploiting business opportunities because it is a key capability for fostering efficiency and innovation (Elnadi and Gheith 2023; Neumeyer, Santos, and Morris 2021). Because the adoption of social media, e-commerce, and big data in business operations is crucial, the abilities to analyse data and use digital devices are essential for social entrepreneurs (Ip 2024). The COVID-19 pandemic also motivated businesses to shift their focus from physical to online operations, which increased the necessity of developing the digital capabilities to conduct marketing and consumer interactions through online platforms; thus, digital literacy strengthens entrepreneurial intentions (Fazil, Ahmad, and Yusof 2022). Because research has indicated that digital literacy can secure a competitive advantage during the start-up process and assist in the dissemination of information about social problems (Ip 2024; Kang, Park, and Jang 2024; Wardana et al. 2022), the following hypothesis was proposed.

# H4. Digital literacy positively affects SEI.

Perceived social support, which is a valuable resource for starting a social enterprise and can be attained by establishing social connections or joining a social network (Ip et al. 2021), is a proxy for external perceived behavioural control. Research reported perceived social support to be a strong predictor of SEI (Cardella et al. 2023; Hossain, Arefin, and Yukongdi 2024; Ip and Liang 2023; Ukil, Ullah, and Hsu 2023). This finding can be attributed to the function of social support in providing emotional support and approval for becoming a social entrepreneur, providing useful information for establishing and operating a social venture, and promoting the discovery of entrepreneurial ideas (Seyoum, Chinta, and Mujtaba 2021). Moreover, other studies have reported a positive effect of perceived social support on SEI (Fox, Muldoon, and Davis 2023; Hockerts 2017; Ip 2024; Seyoum, Chinta, and Mujtaba 2021; Ukil 2022).

# H5. Perceived social support positively affects SEI.

Studies have suggested that the proxies for attitudes, perceived behavioural control, and subjective norms (e.g. outcome expectations and perceived social support) have no influence or only a marginal influence on SEI (Ashraf 2021; Luc 2020; Rambe and Ndofirepi 2021), and various moderators have been proposed to explain this finding (Ip et al. 2021; Ip and Liang 2023; Seyoum, Chinta, and Mujtaba 2021). Difficulties in performing the relevant behaviours, which are dependent on the capabilities, opportunities, and resources of an individual (Sheeran and Webb 2016), may influence the transformation of their favourable attitudes into intentions. Because social entrepreneurship involves both social and economic goals, the skills and resources required to identify entrepreneurial opportunities and knowledge pertaining to social problems are prerequisites for becoming social entrepreneurs. In addition to financial capital, entrepreneurial creativity is a key capability for identifying innovative solutions for social problems and creating competitive products.

Entrepreneurial creativity is the capability to generate original or unique ideas and actions that are essential for starting a venture (Ip et al. 2018). Research on conventional entrepreneurship has asserted that favourable attitudes and perceived behavioural control do not necessarily lead to entrepreneurial intentions because of barriers to entry, such as the lack of resources or ideas (Entrialgo and Iglesias 2020). Creativity can eliminate barriers to entrepreneurship by enabling the development of innovative and practical start-up ideas and the identification of entrepreneurial opportunities (Durnali, Orakci, and Khalili 2023; Entrialgo and Iglesias 2020; Shi et al. 2020), thereby fostering the transformation of favourable attitudes, perceived behavioural control, and subjective norms into intentions. Researchers have also indicated that entrepreneurial passion, which is associated with entrepreneurial creativity (Murad et al. 2021), positively moderates the influences of attitudes and perceived behavioural control on entrepreneurial intentions because entrepreneurial passion can enhance an individual’s perceived confidence and competence in becoming an entrepreneur (Liao et al. 2022).

Few studies on SEI have tested the moderation of entrepreneurial creativity; however, the role of entrepreneurial creativity in moderating the effects of outcome expectations, social responsibility, perceived social awareness among peers, digital literacy, and perceived social support on SEI can be present because of barriers to social entrepreneurship.

Entrepreneurial creativity can enhance the transformation of favourable outcome expectations into SEI. Creative individuals can identify innovative methods for achieving desirable outcomes (Heinonen, Hytti, and Stenholm 2011), thereby increasing the perceived attainability of positive outcomes and perceived feasibility of success (Chang and Chen 2020). Additionally, creativity is often linked with a higher tolerance for risk (Castillo-Vergara and Garcia-Perez-de-Lema 2021; Liu et al. 2021), which is essential in social entrepreneurship, where outcomes can be uncertain and pathways to social impact may be vaguely defined. Entrepreneurial creativity can lead to the development of novel and viable business ideas that can initiate the transformation of students’ favourable expectations into the intention to start a new venture (Entrialgo and Iglesias 2020). However, individuals who lack entrepreneurial creativity tend to be unlikely to start a social enterprise, even if they hold favourable views with respect to social entrepreneurship. Instead, they may opt to purchase products from social enterprises, which involves less risk relative to starting a business.

Although both social responsibility and social awareness are associated with social well-being and an eagerness to identify solutions to social problems (Peng and Liang 2019), awareness of social responsibility or social problems alone may not always have a strong effect on SEI. This is because individuals can contribute to society through activities other than starting a social enterprise, such as donating to charities, volunteering in organisations, or purchasing socially responsible products (Ip 2024). However, if an individual has entrepreneurial creativity, solutions to social problems derived from social responsibility and social awareness among peers are more likely to be practical and are likely to attract more public and media attention. This visibility is essential for establishing an enterprise’s reputation and enhancing the social impact of such efforts, which can motivate an individual to transform their social responsibility into SEI.

Entrepreneurial creativity can enhance the effect of digital literacy on SEI. Entrepreneurial creativity involves the application of business knowledge in practice (Shahab et al. 2019), and it implies that creative individuals are capable of utilising digital tools more effectively than noncreative individuals are in business operations and market analysis, which are crucial for starting a venture. Digitally literate individuals are not necessarily more inclined to start a social enterprise than digitally illiterate individuals are when they lack the entrepreneurial creativity to apply their digital skills in business operations and identify innovative solutions to social problems. Such individuals may choose instead to work in a firm that can benefit from their high productivity and performance (Mohammadyari and Singh 2015). In addition, only individuals who can employ entrepreneurially creative strategies and campaigns to effectively communicate the social values of their enterprise are likely to attract stakeholders and mobilise community support for their social venture (Ip 2024). Therefore, the effect of digital literacy on SEI tends to be stronger among individuals with more entrepreneurial creativity.

Figure 1. Conceptual framework.

Entrepreneurial creativity can enhance the effect of perceived social support on social SEI. However, perceived social support does not always lead to SEI because some individuals perceive the current business environment to be unfavourable or lack a viable business idea for a startup (Entrialgo and Iglesias 2020). Therefore, even with strong social support, an individual may hesitate to establish a social enterprise. However, entrepreneurially creative individuals can overcome these barriers by identifying entrepreneurial opportunities and devising innovative solutions to social problems. This indicates that creative individuals are more adequately equipped than noncreative individuals are to mobilise resources from various sources to leverage entrepreneurial opportunities (Entrialgo and Iglesias 2020; Shi et al. 2020), which can enable them to transform perceived social support into SEI.

H6. Entrepreneurial creativity positively moderates the effects of (a) outcome expectations, (b) social responsibility, (c) perceived social awareness among peers, (d) digital literacy, and (e) perceived social support on SEI.

The proposed conceptual framework is displayed in Figure 1.

# Method

# Participants and procedures

The present study enrolled undergraduate and postgraduate students majoring in business or strategic communication (i.e. advertising and public relations) who were aged 20 years or older. Entrepreneurship education studies have primarily focused on students majoring in business (Duong 2022; Jena 2020; Mykolenko et al. 2022) because these students typically possess extensive knowledge of business and management, which is crucial for starting and operating a business. However, the present study also included students majoring in strategic communication (i.e. advertising and public relations) because these students have relevant business knowledge in areas such as marketing, management, and economics. Individuals who were aged 19 years or younger were excluded because such individuals, who tend to be freshmen and sophomores, might not have a clear understanding of their future prospects. The questionnaire and methodology for this study had been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the author’s university. Questionnaires were administered during the first quarter of 2022 through multiple online platforms in Taiwan, including social media, email, and discussion forums. To ensure that the sex ratio of the sample was balanced, the present study limited the proportion of male or female respondents to no more than $60 \%$ of the sample.

In total, 303 valid responses were collected for analysis. Among the respondents, $4 2 . 9 \%$ and $5 7 . 1 \%$ were men and women, respectively. The median age was 22 years. Undergraduate and postgraduate students accounted for $8 6 . 5 \%$ and $1 3 . 5 \%$ of the sample, respectively. A majority of respondents resided in northern Taiwan $( 5 1 . 8 \% )$ , with the rest in southern Taiwan $( 2 4 . 1 \% )$ , central Taiwan $( 2 2 . 1 \% )$ , and other regions $\left( 2 . 0 \% \right)$ . Although the proportion of women in the sample was higher $( 5 7 . 1 \% )$ than that of the Taiwanese population $( 5 0 . 8 \% )$ Department of Household Registration 2022), this difference was acceptable (Bacq and Alt 2018; Ip et al. 2017; Ip and Liang 2023). Another reason for this sample characteristic is that more women enrolled in business majors (Department of Statistics 2022). The characteristics of the sample are summarised in Table 1.

This study conducted exploratory factor analysis and regression analyses by using SPSS 27.0. To investigate the factor structure of the independent, dependent, and moderating variables, exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation was performed. After the factor structure was determined, multiple regression analysis was performed to evaluate the direct effects of perceived social support, outcome expectations, social responsibility, perceived social awareness among peers, and digital literacy on SEI (H1–5). Before the moderation effects were tested, the composite variable of entrepreneurial creativity was divided into low and high levels. The moderation of entrepreneurial creativity (H6) was then tested using the PROCESS macro of SPSS and 5000 bootstrap samples (Hayes 2018).

# Measures

This study employed several scales adopted or adapted from other studies. Three items pertaining to outcome expectations were drawn from Ip et al. (2021), four items pertaining to social responsibility were drawn from Wurthmann (2013), four items pertaining to perceived social awareness among peers were adapted from Dinev and Hart (2005) and Lichtenstein, Drumwright, and Braig (2004), six items pertaining to digital literacy were adapted from Neumeyer, Santos, and Morris (2021), three items pertaining to perceived social support were drawn from Hockerts (2017), four items pertaining to SEI were drawn from Ip et al. (2017), and five items pertaining to entrepreneurial creativity were drawn from Ip et al. (2018). The items were measured on a 6-point Likert-type scale with endpoints ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree. Age and sex were incorporated as control variables.

# Common method bias

Common method bias, which can potentially inflate the relationships between variables and lead to incorrect conclusions, arises when the same individual responds to both independent and dependent variables as perceptual items (Podsakoff et al. 2003). To verify that common method bias did not affect the outcomes of this study, Harman’s single-factor test, which is a technique commonly utilised in studies published in leading journals, was performed (Duong 2023; Ip et al. 2021;

Pérez-Fernández et al. 2022). The results revealed an explained variance of $3 4 . 7 2 \%$ , which was lower than the $5 0 \%$ threshold, indicating that common method bias was not a severe problem in this study.

# Results

# Evaluation of factor structure

Because the sample had a Kaiser – Meyer – Olkin value of .90 and a Bartlett’s test of sphericity yielded significant results $\textstyle ( \chi ^ { 2 } = 4 9 6 8 . 7 5$ , degrees of freedom $= 4 0 6$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ ), the sample was appropriate for factor analysis. The total variance explained for the variables extracted through exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation was $6 8 . 8 8 \%$ indicating adequate validity (Table 2). All alpha values were greater than .70, displaying that the measures were reliable.

# Evaluation of determinants of SEI

A multiple regression analysis was performed to evaluate the direct effects of the determinants on SEI (Table 3). Perceived social awareness among peers $\langle B = 0 . 2 7$ , standard error $[ S E ] = 0 . 0 7$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ ), digital literacy $\displaystyle { 3 = 0 . 3 5 , S E = 0 . 0 7 , p < . 0 0 1 } )$ , and perceived social support $( B = 0 . 3 8 , S E = 0 . 0 7 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ positively influenced SEI. However, outcome expectations $\left( B = 0 . 1 0 \right.$ , $S E = 0 . 0 9$ , $p = . 2 5 6 )$ ) and social responsibility $( B = - 0 . 0 7 $ , $S E = 0 . 0 9$ , $p = . 4 6 1$ ) did not significantly influence SEI. Among the control variables, age did not influence SEI $( B = - 0 . 0 1$ , $S E = 0 . 0 1$ , $p = . 4 9 8 )$ , whereas sex negatively influenced SEI $( B = - 0 . 3 1$ , $S E = 0 . 1 1$ , $p = . 0 0 4 )$ , showing that women were less likely than men to form SEI.

# Evaluation of moderation of entrepreneurial creativity

The moderating effects of entrepreneurial creativity were tested using the PROCESS macro of SPSS (Table 4). The interaction between entrepreneurial creativity and outcome expectations was marginally significant in Model 1 ${ \boldsymbol { B } } = 0 . 2 8$ , $S E { = } 0 . 1 5$ , $p = . 0 6 7 $ ), indicating that the relationship between outcome expectations and SEI is stronger for those with a higher level of entrepreneurial creativity. The results for the conditional effects (Table 5) indicate that the positive relationship between outcome expectations and SEI was only observed in the respondents with a higher level of entrepreneurial creativity $\ ( B = 0 . 2 7 \ .$ , $S E { = } 0 . 1 3$ , $p = . 0 4 2 ;$ Figure 2). The interaction between entrepreneurial creativity and social responsibility was significant in Model 2 $\langle B = 0 . 3 5$ , $S E { = } 0 . 1 5$ , $p = . 0 1 7 ,$ ), indicating the positive moderation of entrepreneurial creativity on the relationship between social responsibility and SEI. However, the results for the conditional effects indicate that the effect of social responsibility on SEI was nonsignificant in both the less entrepreneurially creative respondents $( B = - 0 . 1 6 ,$ $S E = 0 . 1 0 , p = . 1 1 3 )$ and the more entrepreneurially creative respondents $( B = 0 . 1 8 , S E = 0 . 1 3 , p = . 1 5 1 )$ . The interaction between entrepreneurial creativity and perceived social awareness among peers was nonsignificant in Model 3 $( B = 0 . 1 1$ , $S E { = } 0 . 1 3$ , $p = . 4 1 4 \mathrm { , }$ ), indicating that entrepreneurial creativity did not moderate the relationship between perceived social awareness among peers and SEI. The interaction between entrepreneurial creativity and digital literacy was marginally significant in Model 4 (B $= 0 . 2 5 , S E = 0 . 1 5 , p = . 0 8 9 )$ ; the results for the conditional effects indicate that the effect of digital literacy on SEI was stronger in the respondents with a higher level of entrepreneurial creativity $( B =$ 0.43, $S E { = } 0 . 1 3$ , $p < . 0 0 1 $ ) than in those with a lower level of entrepreneurial creativity $\left( B = 0 . 1 7 \right.$ , SE $= 0 . 0 8$ , $p = . 0 3 6 ;$ ; Figure 3). The interaction between entrepreneurial creativity and perceived social support was significant in Model 5 $( B = 0 . 3 4 , S E = 0 . 1 3 , p = . 0 0 8 )$ , indicating that entrepreneurial creativity positively moderated the relationship between perceived social support and SEI. The results for the conditional effects indicate that the positive effect of perceived social support on SEI was only observed in the respondents with a high level of entrepreneurial creativity $\textstyle ( B = 0 . 4 8$ , $S E { = } 0 . 1 0 , p$ $< . 0 0 1$ ; Figure 4).

# Discussion

This study has revealed that perceived social awareness among peers, digital literacy, and perceived social support directly influenced SEI. However, the direct effects of outcome expectations and social responsibility on SEI were nonsignificant. Moderation analysis indicated that the effects of outcome expectations, social responsibility, digital literacy, and perceived social support on SEI were stronger for individuals with higher entrepreneurial creativity compared to those with lower entrepreneurial creativity.

# Theoretical contributions

Similarly to other studies (Cardella et al. 2023; Fazil, Ahmad, and Yusof 2022; Hossain, Arefin, and Yukongdi 2024; Ip 2024; Ip and Liang 2023; Liu et al. 2019; Ukil, Ullah, and Hsu 2023), this study revealed that perceived social support and digital literacy, which served as proxies for perceived behavioural control, were direct positive predictors of SEI. Because of the emphasis on collectivistic values in East Asian culture, the emotional and financial support of friends and family members is crucial for motivating an individual to take entrepreneurial actions; thus, perceived social support plays a key role in fostering the SEI of the Taiwanese population (Ip and Liang 2023; Liu et al. 2019). Social support is also essential for starting and operating a social venture because social enterprises must engage in both prosocial and entrepreneurial activities (Ip and Liang 2023). Therefore, increasing the size, strength, and diversity of a social network can foster innovation, which is crucial for social entrepreneurship (Baer et al. 2015). Similar to the finding of another study, which reported on the positive relationship between digital literacy and entrepreneurial intentions (Elnadi and Gheith 2023), this study observed that digital literacy directly influenced SEI, indicating the key role of digital competence in facilitating the identification of social entrepreneurial opportunities and the operation of a social venture.

Social awareness among peers was also revealed to be a significant predictor of SEI. Because of the contradictory findings pertaining to the effect of moral obligation on SEI and the limited ability of moral obligation to reflect social influence (i.e. essence of subjective norms; Aloulou and Algarni 2022; Hockerts 2017; Ip et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2019; Rambe and Ndofirepi 2021), this study provided preliminary evidence supporting the use of social awareness among peers as an alternative proxy for subjective norms because social awareness among peers captures how an individual’s interactions with peers can increase their awareness of social problems. This finding corresponds to the assertion of other researchers that significant others can provide useful ideas and knowledge about addressing social problems, thereby contributing to the formation of SEI (Ip 2024; Naznen, Al Mamun, and Rahman 2023).

However, outcome expectations and social responsibility had no significant direct effects on SEI. Similarly, several studies have reported that the direct effects of outcome expectations and social responsibility on SEI were marginal or nonsignificant (Ip et al. 2021; Peng and Liang 2019). Favourable outcome expectations and social responsibility beliefs may be insufficient for motivating Taiwanese people to engage in social entrepreneurship because considerable effort is required to start a social venture. Before an individual becomes a social entrepreneur, they must first develop the confidence and skills necessary for starting a venture, including entrepreneurial creativity. Thus, the positive effects of outcome expectations and social responsibility on intentions may be subject to specific conditions. For example, researchers have indicated that the relationship between outcome expectations of social entrepreneurship and SEI only manifests in individuals who prioritise sustainability and are less motivated by extrinsic rewards when they make career decisions (Ip et al. 2021; Ip and Liang 2023).

This study expands the literature on the theory of planned behaviour by elucidating the positive moderation effect of entrepreneurial creativity. It also addresses a research gap created by studies having focused on testing the direct effect of entrepreneurial creativity on SEI (Ip et al. 2018; Laguía, Moriano, and Gorgievski 2019; Liu et al. 2021; Shahab et al. 2019). The positive moderation effect of entrepreneurial creativity explains the contradictory effects of these relationships. This study also expands the literature by revealing that the positive effects of outcome expectations and perceived social support on SEI only manifest in individuals with a high level of entrepreneurial creativity. Although the effect of digital literacy on SEI was strong in the multiple regression analysis (Table 3), this effect became marginal for respondents with a low level of entrepreneurial creativity (Table 5). Even when a respondent forms favourable attitudes towards social entrepreneurship, receives emotional and financial support from others, and is digitally literate, their interest in becoming a social entrepreneur may be low if they are not entrepreneurially creative. This finding suggests that entrepreneurial creativity plays a crucial role in enhancing confidence in starting a social venture and eliminating the barriers to doing so because creativity is a key element in the formation of innovative ideas for identifying entrepreneurial opportunities and raising public awareness of social problems (Durnali, Orakci, and Khalili 2023; Entrialgo and Iglesias 2020; Ip et al. 2018; Shi et al. 2020).

The present results enrich the research on the positive effects of outcome expectations, digital literacy, and perceived social support on SEI (Cardella et al. 2023; Duong et al. 2023; Fox, Muldoon, and Davis 2023; Ip 2024; Pham et al. 2022) by demonstrating that these effects are not always significant. Although studies have demonstrated how entrepreneurship education and knowledge can enhance entrepreneurial intentions (Duong 2022; Jena 2020; Paray and Kumar 2020), the understanding of how an effective syllabus for entrepreneurship education can be developed remains limited. This study provides empirical evidence on the importance of teaching creativity in entrepreneurship courses and highlights the crucial role of creativity in facilitating the development of a social entrepreneurship orientation.

# Practical implications

The results can help educators and policymakers strengthen the intentions of students to become social entrepreneurs and cultivate their entrepreneurial creativity. To encourage students to generate novel and viable business ideas, educators should implement social entrepreneurship curricula that combine creative learning activities with divergent and convergent thinking exercises (Tantawy et al. 2021). Opportunities to interact with stakeholders, such as discussions, brainstorming workshops, and exchange programmes, are also essential for enhancing students’ creativity and entrepreneurial intentions (Smith, Sardeshmukh, and Combs 2016); these opportunities enable people to share their perspectives on social problems and solutions and promote social enterprise. Creativity does not only aid in creating competitive products, identifying entrepreneurial opportunities, and promoting the venture, but it also plays a crucial role in identifying innovative measures for addressing social problems. Therefore, social entrepreneurship education should encourage students to generate creative and viable ideas that contribute to society and increase public awareness of social problems. For example, universities can hold SDG-oriented social business plan competitions in response to the increasing public emphasis on university social responsibility.

Educators and universities should also focus on nurturing students’ digital literacy, perceived social awareness among peers, and perceived social support. Universities should implement training programmes that teach students how to use digital technologies to facilitate business operations, and they should provide access to and training for data analytics tools. These tools can help aspiring entrepreneurs to understand market trends and consumer behaviours. For example, educators can instruct students in the use of business intelligence tools to derive insights from the big data available on social media platforms, which can enhance business decision-making. In addition, universities should promote interdisciplinary learning by encouraging students from various fields to collaborate on projects (Yi and Duval-Couetil 2021). This model not only facilitates the formation of business relationships but also enables students to develop diverse perspectives. Furthermore, universities should develop mentorship programmes that link students with experienced entrepreneurs who can provide guidance and support (Baluku, Onderi, and Otto 2021).

Governments and policy makers can also help foster social entrepreneurship. Governments should develop an environment conducive to entrepreneurship for university students (Jiatong et al. 2021) through various measures, such as establishing a social entrepreneurship support programme, providing startup funding for undergraduates and fresh graduates, providing coworking spaces for new social entrepreneurs, and establishing a dedicated team or department for promoting innovation. These measures can help students and new social entrepreneurs acquire resources, build social support and overcome barriers to entry. Governments can also provide subsidies to encourage schools to offer courses (e.g. creative thinking and social innovation), thereby enabling students to apply their creative thinking skills. Promotional videos can be produced to introduce various role models and successful social entrepreneurship stories, which can help students identify market needs and create innovative products or services, which are crucial for enhancing selfefficacy beliefs and entrepreneurial creativity.

# Limitations and future research

This study has several limitations. First, because this study only analysed a sample of students from Taiwan, the generalisability of its results to other contexts or countries is limited without further investigation. Second, because all of the items used in this study were measured through a single survey, common method bias could have affected the results. Although a Harman’s single-factor test indicated that common method bias of this study’s results was not severe, future research should adopt other methods, such as qualitative interviews, to analyse the relationship between entrepreneurial creativity and SEI. Third, although the PROCESS macro is a convenient tool, it cannot not be used to determine standardised beta coefficients. Therefore, future research should test the model of this study through structural equation modelling. Fourth, because this study did not aim to compare the effects of different academic majors on SEI, students majoring in other fields (e.g. social work) were not included. Future research should investigate the effect of various academic majors on SEI.

# Conclusion

This study revealed the positive direct effects of perceived social awareness among peers, perceived social support, and digital literacy on SEI. In addition, it demonstrated that entrepreneurial creativity positively moderates the relationships between outcome expectations and SEI, between social responsibility and SEI, between perceived social support and SEI, and between digital literacy and SEI. The findings of this study expand the literature on the theory of planned behaviour by demonstrating that the effects of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control on SEI are subject to entrepreneurial creativity; it also proposes an explanation for the inconsistency in the findings regarding the effects of these proxies on SEI (Aloulou and Algarni 2022; Ashraf 2021; Ip et al. 2021; Santos and Liguori 2020; Ukil 2022).
