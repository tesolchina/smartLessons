In most languages, compared with early verbs corresponding to actions, early nouns semantically corresponding to objects dominate young children’s vocabulary. Werner & Kaplan (1963) theoretically posited that early word meanings are not sufficiently differentiated into specific categories; rather they correspond to holistic events as a total situation in which multiple components (e.g., objects and actions) are intimately fused. Thus, it is important to ask whether early noun meanings are inherently specific object categories or whether they are initially undifferentiated events and are subsequently differentiated.

As a revision of Werner & Kaplan’s (1963) assumption, this thesis proposes the “semantic pluripotency hypothesis” to experimentally investigate the semantic content of early words and their development (Hagihara 2021). The hypothesis comprises two subhypotheses. First, children’s early word meanings are pluripotent in nature, as they correspond to the context-bound fusion of factors emerging from children’s experiences related to the word. Second, such word meanings have plasticity as they dynamically differentiate into specific and decontextualized categories with later development. We posited that the early object word meanings are undifferentiated events including both objects and actions, and they subsequently differentiate into specific objects, independent of actions.

First, we investigated whether and how object word meanings changed with development (Hagihara & Sakagami 2020). Japanese monolingual toddlers aged 19–35 months $\left( N = 3 6 \right)$ ) watched two juxtaposed video stimuli in which a girl was performing an action using certain objects and were thereafter prompted to choose one of the stimuli followed by questions regarding familiar object words (e.g., which ones are shoes?). Statistical modeling demonstrated that even young participants were able to select the appropriate stimulus when objects and actions were compatible (e.g., “putting shoes on” vs. “rubbing two baskets”). However, when objects and actions were incompatible (e.g., “rubbing shoes” vs. “putting on two baskets”), the probability of selecting a stimulus that included target objects remained at the chance level for participants aged less than 21 months; contrastingly the probability steeply increased for older participants. Although the robustness of these results was unclear, owing to a preliminary study, the results supported the semantic pluripotency hypothesis.

Next, we investigated the extent to which looking and pointing responses were equivalently interpretable in forced-choice tasks (Hagihara et al. 2021) to prepare for the replication of our previous findings in children around the critical period when the semantic differentiation of object words is likely to occur. In a preliminary study, we observed that young toddlers often did not provide clear pointing, although they appeared to spend more time looking at one of the stimuli presented simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, the validity of treating these indices as equivalent has not yet been proven. Thus, we investigated how accurately “pointing” can be predicted from concurrent preferential “looking.” We developed models predicting pointing from looking responses using part of the video data of toddlers aged 18–23 months $N = 4 8$ ) obtained by Hagihara et al. (2022).

The prediction accuracy for the proposed models was substantial $\cdot 8 5 . 8 \% - 8 9 . 7 \%$ agreement), indicating that looking would be a reasonable alternative index for pointing. Meanwhile, exploratory analysis revealed that looking without pointing qualitatively differed from looking with pointing, suggesting the need to use both pointing and looking indices for analysis to interpret the obtained data in detail. The proposed models enable us to apply the same forced-choice task used in Hagihara & Sakagami’s study (2020) to younger toddlers, without data loss, and to perform the same statistical analysis for both pointing and looking measurements.

Finally, in addition to confirming the robustness of the previous findings, we investigated whether toddlers could appropriately understand object word referents solely based on objectspecific actions, and how developmental changes in object word meanings were related to vocabulary growth (Hagihara et al. 2022). Both cross-sectional $\left( N = 6 9 \right)$ ) and longitudinal $( N = 1 6 )$ ) data of 18–23-month-old toddlers showed that only younger participants could not select the correct stimulus that matched object words when objects and actions were presented separately (e.g., “rubbing shoes” vs. “putting on two baskets”), despite the success when objects and actions were matched. The older participants could select the appropriate stimulus for both conditions. It was certain that object word meanings developmentally changed steeply during the latter half of the second year of children’s lives. The results from the additional conditions demonstrated that participants of all age ranges failed to judge object word referents solely by actions. These results were robust for both pointing and preferential-looking measurements. Taken together, they indicate that the early object word meanings are global events comprising both objects and actions, which later differentiate into specific objects. Moreover, the degree of semantic differentiation of object words was positively related to vocabulary growth of action words, suggesting that this semantic differentiation encouraged toddlers to develop new label–meaning connections used for specific actions, apart from objects.

Overall, our findings corroborate the semantic pluripotency hypothesis, provide the first experimental and direct support for Werner & Kaplan’s (1963) theoretical hypothesis, and set a stage for future research on early word learning. The experimental exploration of this thesis demonstrates semantic flexibility and plasticity with development and will contribute to illuminating further aspects of the uniqueness of children’s early words.
