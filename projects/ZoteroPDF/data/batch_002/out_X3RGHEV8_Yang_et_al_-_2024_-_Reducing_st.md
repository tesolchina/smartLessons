# ABSTRACT

Foreign Language Anxiety (FLA) is considered a central affective factor influencing English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learning. This study thus developed an online simulation game to create a virtually situated learning environment for reducing EFL primary school students’ FLA levels and improving their English vocabulary learning. A total of 110 fifth graders from four classes participated in this study. Two classes were randomly assigned to the experimental group $( N = 5 7 )$ ) using the online simulation game, and the other two classes were the control group $( N = 5 3 )$ using onsite instruction. Each participant was then classified as a low, moderate, or high anxiety student based on the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS). This study found that, compared to the onsite instruction, the online simulation game more effectively assisted the low, moderate, and high anxiety students in reducing their FLA. Situated learning in the online simulation game made a connection between English vocabulary learning and the real world explicitly and visibly, which could further promote their English vocabulary learning. In particular, the moderate and high anxiety students’ English vocabulary learning was significantly improved after the online simulation game. These results suggest that an online simulation game can create a situated learning environment that helps reduce EFL students’ FLA and subsequently facilitate their English vocabulary learning.

# 1.  Introduction

Context plays a vital role in foreign language learning, especially for primary education. Primary education is a crucial learning stage for students who learn English as a Foreign Language (EFL), as evidence has shown that those who learn a language early generally ‘achieve native or near-native proficiency in the target language’ (Sang, 2017, p. 3). During the process of EFL learning, the understanding of English vocabulary is fundamental and essential to mastering English (Schmitt, 2008; Wei et  al., 2018). However, onsite EFL instruction taking place at primary schools in Taiwan generally provides EFL students with a uniform learning pattern. EFL primary schools students are generally taught English vocabulary via rote memorization, and sentences with fixed grammatical rules. The way students learn English in onsite instruction seems to be distant and separate from real-world contexts (Hwang et  al., 2014; Hwang & Chen, 2013), and this could result in additional difficulties for students to learn English vocabulary (Uz Bilgin & Tokel, 2019).

When EFL primary school students feel that learning English vocabulary is hard, they may lose confidence and generate negative emotions, such as foreign language anxiety (FLA). FLA refers to ‘a distinct complex of self-perceptions, beliefs, feelings, and behaviors related to classroom language learning arising from the uniqueness of the language learning process’ (Horwitz et  al., 1986, p. 128). FLA is commonly regarded as a critical mental block that impedes language learning (Lin et  al., 2015; Melchor-Couto, 2017; Yang et  al., 2018; Zaccoletti et  al., 2020; Zhang, 2019). Given that FLA is considered a central affective factor influencing students’ EFL learning (Zheng, 2008), there is an urgent need to adjust the context of onsite instruction.

Situated learning could be an alternative instructional design to change the context of onsite instruction (Gee, 2004). The situated cognition theory states that ‘knowledge is situated, being in part a product of the activity, context, and culture in which it is developed and used’ (Brown et  al., 1989, p. 32). On the basis of situated cognition theory, instruction should provide students with an authentic context in which they can learn and construct knowledge from experiences relevant to real-world situations (Herrington et  al., 2014). In addition, Horwitz (2017) suggested that creating a less stressful context could be an optimal approach for teachers who aim to assist students with FLA in learning English. Research has established that digital games can provide a less stressful context for students with FLA, and encourage them to engage in EFL learning (Yang et  al., 2018).

An online simulation game, a type of digital game, is characterized by the feature that reflects reality in the simulation (Loon et  al., 2015). Integration of an online simulation game into onsite instruction provides students with ‘realistic simulations of diverse real-world activities’ (Peterson, in press, p. 2) as well as engages them in an entertaining context to achieve the learning goals (Gros, 2007). However, most studies related to how online simulation games affect FLA reduction or EFL learning have been conducted in higher education (e.g. Grant et  al., 2014; Grant et  al., 2013; Meihami et  al., 2013; Melchor-Couto, 2017; Ranalli, 2008). Little attention has been paid to the application of an online simulation game in primary EFL education (Acquah & Katz, 2020; Peterson, in press). Although a few studies have attempted to integrate an online simulation game into primary EFL education for English vocabulary learning (e.g. Tseng et  al., 2020) or EFL learning (e.g. Lan, 2015), these studies did not focus on investigating the role of FLA.

As has been noted, onsite EFL instruction in primary schools frequently faces the challenges of a lack of connection between English learning and real-world scenarios (Hwang et  al., 2014; Hwang & Chen, 2013). It is vital to reveal whether an online simulation game can bring benefits to students’ English vocabulary learning through the creation of a virtually situated learning environment. In addition, an investigation into how an online simulation game was integrated into primary EFL onsite instruction to situate students with FLA in an authentic context would provide critical insights for teachers who aim to conduct additional instruction for reducing the impact of FLA and improving students’ English vocabulary learning. As such, the current study employed an online simulation game that aimed at reducing primary school students’ FLA and facilitating their English vocabulary learning. Specifically, three research questions were proposed as follows.

1. What are the effects of an online simulation game and onsite instruction on primary school students’ FLA?   
2. What are the effects of an online simulation game and onsite instruction on primary school students’ English vocabulary learning?   
3. What are primary school students’ perceptions of the online simulation game and onsite instruction?

# 2.  Literature review

Anxiety is generally classified into trait anxiety, state anxiety, and situation-specific anxiety. Trait anxiety states that individuals ‘tend to be anxious in their everyday lives,’ while state anxiety refers to ‘the onset of anxiety at particular moments’ (Horwitz, 2017, p. 33). Horwitz (2017) identified FLA as a type of situation-specific anxiety which refers to ‘an individual’s tendency to be anxious in specific situations,’ i.e. a situation of language learning (p. 33). To identify students who tended to be anxious in a specific situation of foreign language learning, Horwitz et  al. (1986) designed a Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS). Much evidence has been established that there is a negative relationship between FLA and foreign language learning performance (Hu et  al., in press; Teimouri et  al., 2019; Zhang, 2019). MacIntyre and Gardner (1994b) also revealed that students who experienced FLA generally had greater difficulties learning English vocabulary.

Wei et  al. (2018) mentioned that the quality of language learning could not only be related to affective factors (e.g. FLA) but could also depend on the learning context. Uz Bilgin and Tokel (2019) found that students learned English vocabulary efficiently and positively when they were involved in an authentic context, as the context provided them with opportunities to repeatedly use and learn words in association with the real world. In contrast, in the context of onsite instruction with the lack of authenticity (Hwang & Chen, 2013), some students’ negative emotions in language learning were frequently provoked such as feeling frustrated about receiving poor learning evaluations, or experiencing fear of presenting in English in front of classmates (Chan & Wu, 2004).

Situated cognition theory, emphasizing that students learn ‘knowledge and skills in contexts that reflect the way the knowledge will be useful in real life’ (Collins, 1991, p. 2), was used to create an authentic context for the current study. Besides situating students in a physical context to learn English (Uz Bilgin & Tokel, 2019), virtually situated learning is an alternative way to provide students with an authentic and meaningful learning experience for language learning development (Chang et  al., 2020). An online simulation game is a type of digital game that ‘[incorporates] simulated real-life activities to facilitate learning in contextualized ways’ (Hung et  al., 2018, p. 96). The context of an online simulation game allows students to iteratively rehearse real-life conversations, and learn independently (Hung et  al., 2018; Saliés, 2002). Melchor-Couto (2017) found that an online simulation game motivated students to engage in the gameplay in a less stressful context. During the gameplay, students are able to receive real-time feedback to reflect their quality of learning (Berns et  al., 2013). Compared to the context of onsite instruction, it seems that an online simulation game has more potential to immerse students in a virtually authentic and less stressful context.

In the past, there were few studies (Lan, 2015; Tseng et  al., 2020) that integrated an online simulation game into a primary EFL classroom. Tseng et  al. (2020) attempted to facilitate primary school students’ English vocabulary learning in a $_ { 3 \mathrm { D } }$ virtual environment created by a simulation game. The results show that a simulation game was able to immerse students in a virtual and dynamic environment to enhance their English vocabulary learning. Another study by Lan (2015) used a simulation game to assist primary school students in learning English vocabulary, sentences, and conversations about night markets and restaurants. The results reported that students’ English syntactic and conversational abilities were improved, as the game created a virtual game-like context that allowed the students to learn English without time or space limits. Although these studies pointed out that online simulation games could benefit students’ vocabulary or English learning improvement, they did not address the changes in FLA levels or the role of students’ FLA on their English vocabulary learning. Unlike the previous studies which only depicted the benefits of the virtual worlds created by online simulation games for students’ English learning (e.g. Lan, 2015; Tseng et  al., 2020), the current study shed light on how an online simulation game affected students’ FLA and English vocabulary learning. The current study thus attempted to integrate an online simulation game into primary EFL classes based on situated cognition theory (Brown et  al., 1989) to reduce primary school students’ FLA levels whereby their English vocabulary learning was facilitated.

# 3.  Methods

# 3.1.  Participants

A sample of 110 participants was recruited from four classes at two public primary schools in central Taiwan. They were primary school fifth-grade students, ranging in age from 11 to 12. After 2 years of learning English as a foreign language (EFL), the fifth graders had simple sentence construction skills and an English vocabulary size of between 350 and 450 words. Two classes were randomly assigned to the experimental group while the others were the control group. The participants in the experimental group (57 students) were assigned to the online simulation game; others in the control group (53 students) engaged in the onsite instruction. The same English teacher taught the four classes with the same learning topic, making spaghetti. Before the experiment, a consent form was distributed to all participants and was signed by their parents to confirm their agreement to participate in this study.

# 3.2.  Research design

The learning topic, making spaghetti, is one topic in the fifth-graders’ English curriculum. From the teacher’s observations, learning the content of making spaghetti in English, such as the vocabulary for the ingredients and the procedural knowledge of making spaghetti, is too abstract for some fifth-graders. In addition, the teacher has found it difficult to situate the students in a real cooking activity in onsite instruction, as there are some serious issues of real cooking activity integration including time and space limits, shortage of cooking resources, and safety concerns. Creating virtually situated learning provides a safe alternative to physically situated learning (i.e. a real cooking activity). This study thus developed an online simulation game that integrated learning content of making spaghetti (vocabulary and procedural knowledge) with game elements to create a simulated cooking scenario for primary school students, who particularly suffered from FLA, to learn English vocabulary. The research design of this study is shown in Figure 1. Situated learning in the online simulation game (the experimental group) and onsite instruction (the control group) were separately conducted in this study for a duration of 6 weeks with 45 minutes per week. A FLCAS pretest and a pre-written test were used before the treatments. For the experimental group, the teacher played the role of the facilitator to assist in their game-based learning. The students first learned the basics of the online simulation game including tablet operation, rule setting, and game features for approximately 20 minutes in the first week. They were then given a demonstration of how they could engage in gameplay for the rest of the first-week class. For the following 5 weeks, each student was given an iPad to individually complete the challenges in the game.

Figure 1. T he research design.

For the control group, the role of the teacher is a lecturer. An ice-breaking activity (e.g. drawing their favorite meal and guessing) was first given, and the syllabus was introduced to the students in the first week to attract their attention and quickly let them focus on the learning topic. During the next 2 weeks, the instructor taught the students the vocabulary of the ingredients of making spaghetti and the steps of making spaghetti by using PPT slides, textbooks, and flashcards. For the last 3 weeks, some in-class learning activities took place for reviewing and practicing the learning content of making spaghetti, such as rolling the dice and reading the sentences, ring toss, and reading the vocabulary, bingo challenges, or competition of reading aloud the dialogues. Worksheets and quizzes were also given to strengthen their memorization of the learning content of making spaghetti. After the treatments ended, both groups of students were required to complete a FLCAS posttest, post-written test, and open-ended questionnaire.

# 3.3.  Situated learning in the online simulation game

The design of the online simulation game in this study took on the situated cognition theory perspective (Brown et  al., 1989) and was based on Choi and Hannafin’s guidelines (1995) to create situated learning for primary school students with FLA to learn the theme of making spaghetti. According to Choi and Hannafin (1995), there are four basic elements that should be considered in the design of situated learning, namely context, content, facilitation, and assessment. Figure 2 shows how the online simulation game developed in this study could relate to these basic elements to involve the students in situated learning. The context of the online simulation game was created through the integration of content with game elements (e.g. rules, challenges, visual and audio stimuli, simulated cooking activities, feedback, and student-centered control) and the basic assessment system. The online simulation game which simulated the process of the cooking activity provided the students with an authentic context to build a connection between the students and a realistic situation. The authentic context created by the online simulation game in this study refers to reflecting a situation in which primary school students use the vocabulary to express themselves in a real-world cooking activity of making spaghetti.

Figure 2. T he instructional design of the online simulation game.

In terms of content, the system incorporates vocabulary and procedural knowledge for making spaghetti, while the game elements include the rules, challenges, visual and audio stimuli, simulated cooking activities, feedback, and student-centered control. Building on the game elements, four edutainment-oriented challenges were created, namely Cooking the Noodles, Picking the Ingredients, Making the sauce, and Serving. These challenges with real-life and entertaining characteristics were designed to encourage the students to actively engage in the process of EFL learning. During the gameplay, the point system in the online simulation game (assessment) provided the students with the opportunities to review their performance. Then, the students were able to modify their performance and try to make progress with their English vocabulary learning. Each student was given a tablet (facilitation) through which they took part in situated learning in the online simulation game. With the engagement of this situated learning, the students’ FLA was expected to reduce, and their reduction of FLA might further contribute to their English vocabulary learning.

# 3.4.  Instruments

# 3.4.1.  Foreign language classroom anxiety scale (FLCAS)

To date, the Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS), designed by Horwitz et  al. (1986), has been generally conducted to investigate students’ FLA. Zhang (2019) mentioned that FLCAS was recommended for use ‘if the purpose is to measure the overall anxiety level across various FL learning contexts’ (p. 11). Thus, the FLCAS is an appropriate instrument for the current study to identify primary school students who were particularly anxious about their English learning in different specific English learning situations, i.e. either the situated learning in the online simulation game or onsite instruction.

Considering that the participants were native Chinese speakers, the revised version of FLCAS translated from English to Chinese was adapted in this study. FLCAS, consisting of 28 items, is a 5-point Likert scale between 1 (never) and 5 (always). The FLCAS score indicates the students’ levels of foreign language anxiety in a specific context (i.e. either in the online simulation game or in the onsite instruction). According to a Cronbach’s Alpha analysis, the FLCAS in this study reached a high level of reliability with Cronbach’s $\mathfrak { a } = . 9 1 6$ . Following GhorbanDordinejad and Nasab’s division principle (2013) to identify the participants of this study as low, moderate, or high anxiety students, the FLA total scores of 28 to 56 are considered low, from 57 to 70 moderate, and from 71 to 140 high. Table 1 reports the distribution of the participants in the experimental and control groups in terms of their FLA levels based on the results of the FLCAS pretest.

# 3.4.2.  The online simulation game

The online simulation game, Let’s make spaghetti, was designed for simulation of cooking activities from real life. With the integration of content and game elements, this game consists of four edutainment-oriented challenges, namely Cooking the Noodles, Picking the Ingredients, Making the sauce, and Serving. These challenges were arranged in procedural order to simulate the real cooking process of making spaghetti. Each challenge provided the students with different ways to learn English vocabulary.

In the first challenge, Cooking the Noodles, the students not only learned how to cook the noodles in the simulated cooking environment but also learned the vocabulary through hearing the pronunciation from the system. When the students finished the first process of making spaghetti, they would enter the second challenge, Picking the Ingredients. The second challenge was designed to assist the students in learning how to prepare the needed ingredients for making the sauce. In this challenge, the students were encouraged to accurately speak the sentence after selecting the needed ingredients. The tablet device then automatically recorded the player’s voice to compare the accuracy of his/her pronunciation against the Speech framework’s database from Apple Inc. for providing the students with instant feedback. Through this challenge, the students became more familiar with what ingredients were required for making the sauce, and the vocabulary of the ingredients.

After mastering the needed ingredients, the students learned how to make the sauce through the third challenge, Making the sauce. Figure 3 shows the interface of the third challenge. In this challenge, the students were given procedural knowledge to learn how to make the sauce step by step. The procedural knowledge incorporated six cooking steps, and each step was depicted in a sentence (e.g. Step 2. Chop some _.). To complete this challenge, the students were required to choose the correct answer (e.g. onions) to complete the sentence (e.g. slice some onions) based on the scenario in the game. After the students chose the correct answer to the questions, they could enjoy the simulated cooking activity of chopping some onions by clicking the screen. Next, the students entered the last challenge which was the last process of making spaghetti, Serving. In the last challenge, the students could not only had an experience of how to serve spaghetti with the sauce but could also reviewed the vocabulary they had learned in the prior challenges through spelling out the vocabulary of the ingredients.

# 3.4.3.  The written test

The written test (see Appendix A) was developed in this study according to the fifth-graders’ learning content of making spaghetti. It was used to evaluate how well the students learned the relevant English vocabulary in either the online simulation game or onsite instruction. There were two types of test items in this written test including 12 items for word matching, and 10 multiple-choice questions. Word matching assesses the students’ understanding of the vocabulary of the ingredients for making spaghetti. The multiple-choice questions evaluate how well the students could compose a sentence by selecting an appropriate word. Before the experiment, the written test was rated by two English teachers. With the assessment of the Cronbach’s Alpha Model, the statistics indicated that the written test had a high level of reliability (Cronbach’s $\mathtt { a } = . 9 2 7 .$ ).

# 3.4.4.  The open-ended questionnaire

The open-ended questionnaire was designed to ascertain primary school students’ perceptions of either the online simulation game or onsite instruction such as feelings, feedback, or what they had learned. The three open-ended questions are shown below.

Q1. Do you like the given learning activities of the online simulation game/onsite instruction? Why or why not? (Please give an example.) Q2. What difficulties did you encounter during the learning process of the online simulation game/onsite instruction? Q3. Do you think the online simulation game/onsite instruction will help improve your English learning? Why or why not?

# 3.5.  Procedure of data collection

The data collection of this study was conducted for a duration of 8 weeks. In the first week, both the experimental group with the online simulation game and the control group with onsite instruction were asked to complete the FLCAS pretest to identify their FLA levels and the pre-written test to understand their prior knowledge of the vocabulary of making spaghetti. During the following 6 weeks, both groups of students engaged in instructional activities designed for each of the respective learning modes (i.e. the online simulation game and onsite instruction).

After the 6-week instruction ended, the post-survey of FLCAS and the written post-test were given to examine any variation in the anxiety levels of both groups, and their improvements in English vocabulary learning. An open-ended questionnaire was additionally given to both groups to investigate their perceptions of different instructional approaches.

# 3.6.  Procedure of data analysis

Data collection of this study included FLCAS pre- and posttests, preand post- written tests, and the open-ended questionnaire. The results of FLCAS and the written tests were analyzed by nonparametric tests in the SPSS software including the Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Nonparametric tests were used in the current study for two reasons. Firstly, the collected data had non-normal distribution according to the Shapiro-Wilk test $\left( p < . 0 5 \right)$ . Secondly, the nonparametric tests could provide greater statistical power than the parametric tests in the study with a small sample size (Bradley, 1968, 1978, as cited in Hunter & May, 1993).

First, the differences in FLA levels and learning outcomes between both groups before the instruction were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test. The results of the FLCAS pretest showed that there was no significant difference in the anxiety levels of the experimental $\prime M { = } 6 4 . 4 2 $ ) and control groups $\langle M = 6 3 . 9 2 \rangle$ before the instruction $( Z = - . 1 4 7$ , $\textit { p } =$ . $^ { 8 8 3 } \ ( > \ . 0 5 ) ,$ . This finding indicates that both groups of students had a similar degree of FLA. As for the results of the pre-written test, no significant difference between the experimental $( M = 8 4 . 6 2 )$ and control groups $( M = 8 1 . 1 4 )$ was evident, that is, both groups of students had similar prior knowledge of vocabulary about the theme of making spaghetti $( Z = - 1 . 1 5 4$ , $p = . 2 4 9 \ ( > . 0 5 ) )$ .

Second, to examine the differences in the low, moderate, and high anxiety students’ FLA between the FLCAS pre- and posttest, and the differences in their English vocabulary learning between the pre- and post-written tests, both groups of students were divided into subgroups according to their FLA levels. Dwivedi et  al. (2017) mentioned that ‘when using asymptotic nonparametric tests, a sample size of at least 16 is required for using Wilcoxon rank and signed-rank tests’ (p. 2193). The sample number of each subgroup in the current study is more than 16, indicating that the Wilcoxon signed-rank test could be utilized to analyze the data.

Lastly, the analysis of the open-ended questionnaire was based on Elo and Kyngäs’s suggestion (2008) of three steps of inductive content analysis including open coding, creating categories, and abstraction. The students’ texts from the open-ended questionnaire were firstly open coded for summarizing the description of the students’ perspectives. The open coding was then classified into categories. Researchers compared and grouped similar categories together. Finally, the abstraction process formulated the main categories from the categories through researchers’ interpretation. During the process of abstraction, disagreement between the researchers was resolved by discussion. The interrater reliability of the open-ended questionnaire content analysis was .87 (Cohen’s Kappa) between the two researchers.

# 4.  Results

# 4.1.  Variation in the students’ FLA levels through the online simulation game or onsite instruction

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was conducted to examine if the students’ FLA had significantly changed after engaging in either the online simulation game or onsite instruction. Table 2 reports the results of the FLCAS pretest and posttest for both groups. For the experimental group, the FLA levels of the low, moderate, and high anxiety students were significantly reduced. For the control group, in contrast, there were no significant differences between before and after the onsite instruction in terms of low, moderate, or high anxiety students’ FLA levels. It seems that there were few effects of onsite instruction on the reduction in the students’ FLA levels. To further confirm which instructional approach could more effectively reduce the students’ FLA, a comparison of the experimental and control groups’ FLA levels from the FLCAS posttest was conducted. The results reported that there was a significant difference $\left( \mathrm { Z } = - 3 . 1 2 3 \right.$ , $p = . 0 0 2 ^ { * * } \left( < . 0 1 \right) )$ in FLA levels between the experimental and control groups after the instruction. The mean score of the experimental group $( \mathrm { M } = 4 9 . 2 6 )$ was significantly lower than that of the control group $\left( \mathrm { M } = 6 1 . 9 4 \right)$ , which indicated that situated learning in the online simulation game more effectively reduced primary school students’ FLA levels.

# 4.2.  The students’ English vocabulary learning through the online simulation game and onsite instruction

The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was conducted to examine if the students’ English vocabulary learning could be significantly improved through either the online simulation game or onsite instruction. As shown in Table 3, the students in the experimental group generally made significant progress with their vocabulary learning, while there was no significant difference in English vocabulary learning for the students in the control group. For the experimental group, the statistics also showed that low anxiety students had a slight improvement in their English vocabulary learning from 92.30 to 95.23. The high and moderate anxiety students’ English vocabulary learning made statistically significant improvement $\left( p < . 0 5 \right)$ . In contrast with the students in the experimental group, the students with low, moderate, and high levels of FLA in the control group only made relatively slight progress $\left( p > . 0 5 \right)$ with their English vocabulary learning. In addition, through a comparison of the experimental and control groups’ post-written test, this study further confirmed which instruction could be more beneficial to the students’ English vocabulary learning. The statistical results of the difference in the post-written test of the two groups indicated that the students who learned English vocabulary through the online simulation game $( \mathrm { M } = 9 2 . 6 3 \ )$ ) outperformed the students who learned through onsite instruction $\mathrm { ( M } = 8 1 . 7 9 \ $ , $Z = - 4 . 5 1 9$ , $p = . 0 0 0 ^ { * * * } \left( < . 0 0 1 \right) )$ . This result indicated that the online simulation game was more effective in terms of facilitating the students’ English vocabulary learning than onsite instruction.

The results of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that in the experimental group, students’ FLA levels reduced and their English vocabulary learning performance increased after the engagement of the online simulation game. It was thus interesting to further understand whether there was a relationship between the reduction of FLA and the improvement of English vocabulary learning performance or not. Pearson correlation coefficient was then used to examine the relationship between students’ reduction of FLA and their English vocabulary improvement for the experimental group. The results found that there was a significantly positive relationship between the reduction of FLA and English vocabulary improvement $\begin{array} { r } { { \bf \ddot { \Delta } } r { \bf \Delta } = { \bf \Delta } . 6 6 1 } \end{array}$ , $p ~ < ~ . 0 0 1 ^ { * * * } )$ . This significantly positive relationship showed that the more degree FLA was reduced, the more extent English vocabulary learning performance could be improved. It indicated that for the experimental group, students’ reduction of FLA could play a vital role in their English vocabulary learning improvement.

# 4.3.  The students’ perceptions of the online simulation game and onsite instruction

Table 4 provides an overview of the low, moderate, and high anxiety students’ perceptions of either the online simulation game or the onsite instruction. It was found that compared to the students in the control group, the students in the experimental group generally had a more positive learning experience.

According to the summary of the students’ responses in Table 4, the low, moderate, and high anxiety students in the experimental group showed high interest in the online simulation game. The majority of the students liked to play the games generally for three reasons. First, they liked the challenges in the game. Second, they liked to learn vocabulary with visual and audio stimuli. Third, they liked the simulated cooking activities in the game, as they could experience the process of making spaghetti in this virtually authentic context. In addition, the students in the experimental group mentioned that the challenges in the game could assist them in learning English vocabulary and the procedural knowledge of making spaghetti. They further reported that the challenges in the game made it easier to learn and remember the English vocabulary.

In contrast, Table 4 shows that although over half of the low, moderate, and high anxiety students in the control group revealed their interest in this learning topic, they still encountered some difficulties in their learning. For example, over half of the high anxiety students $( 6 6 \% )$ in the control group felt that ‘the procedures of making spaghetti are abstract and complicated.’ Some students also mentioned that it could be difficult for them to imagine the cooking activities of making spaghetti through reading the sentences in the textbook. The possible explanation of this result was that the teaching pattern of the onsite instruction was textbook-based teaching. Because the textbook merely provided the students with the knowledge, the students might find it difficult to connect the learning content to the activity of making spaghetti in the real world. Overall, situated learning in the online simulation game could assist the students in reducing their FLA, allowing them to learn English vocabulary more effectively than with the textbook teaching in the onsite instruction.

# 5.  Discussion

As FLA is commonly regarded as one of the critical affective factors impeding students’ EFL learning (Lin et  al., 2015; Melchor-Couto, 2017; Yang et  al., 2018; Zaccoletti et  al., 2020; Zhang, 2019), this study demonstrated how the online simulation game created situated learning to affect primary school students’ FLA levels and their English vocabulary learning. This bridges the research gap resulting from previous studies only conducting simulation games to assist primary school students in vocabulary or EFL learning without investigating the role of FLA (Lan, 2015; Tseng et al., 2020).

The findings of this study showed that, compared to the onsite instruction, the online simulation game more effectively reduced the low, moderate, and high anxiety students’ FLA to facilitate their English vocabulary learning. According to the comments from the open-ended questionnaire in this study, the students who engaged in the situated learning in the online simulation game generally had more positive perceptions of English vocabulary learning than those in the onsite instruction. The students’ comments echoed the statistical results of this study showing that the online simulation game could more significantly reduce the low, moderate, and high anxiety students’ FLA than the onsite instruction. These findings also support the perspectives of the previous studies mentioning that context is critical for EFL students (Güzel & Aydin, 2014). Based on the results of this study, this is especially true for the students with FLA.

The online simulation game was vastly different from the onsite instruction, with a twofold effect on the students’ FLA and their English vocabulary learning. First, the situated learning in the online simulation game provided the students with more connections between vocabulary learning and real-world situations than the onsite instruction. The students in the onsite instruction were generally taught the English vocabulary from the textbook. Then, they were arranged to do some worksheets or quizzes for practice. From the results of the open-ended questionnaire, some students thought that the procedure of making spaghetti was complicated, and it was abstract for them to imagine and comprehend. In contrast, in the online simulation game, different vocabulary test items were integrated with the game elements to create situated learning. When the students engaged in the gameplay on each challenge in the game, they could first finish the test items and then experience the simulated cooking activities created by the game for learning and practice. This authentic context put the students at ease instead of generating negative emotions (Melchor-Couto, 2017). In addition, the gameplay made them enjoy their vocabulary learning. In particular, the simulated cooking activity assisted the students in enhancing their memory of the vocabulary, which is consistent with Uz Bilgin and Tokel’s findings (2019).

Second, the online simulation game tended to be more student-oriented than the onsite instruction. In the online simulation game, the teacher played the role of the facilitator to assist the students in their learning and their use of tablets. The students’ English vocabulary learning mainly depended on the online simulation game. The arranged challenges in the game guided the students to learn English vocabulary. When the students made a mistake, they were corrected by the system feedback provided by the game, and they had a chance to try the task again. In the onsite instruction, in contrast, the teacher generally played the role of the lecturer. When the students made a mistake, they would be corrected by their teacher in front of their classmates. In this situation, some students with FLA might have fear of being corrected by the teacher, and fear of being laughed at by their classmates. This could explain why the low, moderate, and high anxiety students’ FLA levels in the onsite instruction were not significantly reduced.

# 6.  Conclusion

This study developed an online simulation game based on situated cognition theory (Brown et  al., 1989) and used Choi and Hannafin’s guidelines (1995) to create appropriate situated learning for primary school students who suffered from FLA. It was found that the design of the online simulation game in this study was able to immerse primary school students in an authentic context with a high association with a real-world cooking situation. This connection between the students and a real-world cooking situation enabled low, moderate, and high anxiety students to visualize the learning content of making spaghetti. The game elements such as the challenges, visual and audio stimuli, and the simulated cooking activities assisted them in reducing their FLA and in facilitating their English vocabulary knowledge. Overall, this study contributes to the related research fields by (1) providing a new understanding of how students’ FLA can be reduced through situated learning in the online simulation game; (2) demonstrating how situated learning in the online simulation game is able to assist them in English vocabulary learning; and (3) revealing that the online simulation game is an effective technology for creating situated learning for primary school students with FLA.

Finally, there are some limitations to the current study and suggestions for future research. First, it is suggested that a larger sample size be carried out in future studies to overcome the limitation of the small sample size in the current study, and to obtain more precise and broader information. Second, as the period of integrating an online simulation game into the EFL classroom was short, the long-term effects of an online simulation game on primary school students’ FLA and their English vocabulary learning are highly recommended for investigation in future research. Lastly, as the participants in this study were primary school students, it is difficult for these students to precisely describe how their FLA changed after the online simulation game. Further research is thus suggested to explore in depth the learning behaviors of primary school students with different FLA levels during the intervention of an online simulation game to provide more specific evidence demonstrating how and why the students’ FLA changed.
