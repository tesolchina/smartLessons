# ABSTRACT

Repeated viewing of the same video is a common strategy among autonomous language learners as well as a much used pedagogical strategy among foreign language (FL) teachers. Learners may watch the same video more than once, to increase global comprehension of the target language or to focus their attention on linguistic aspects, such as new vocabulary or pronunciation. This study sought to examine to what extent repetition is more efficient for vocabulary learning if the second viewing follows the first immediately, or a week later. Participants were upper intermediate-level college learners who were distributed into three groups, one watched a TV series episode twice in the same session, one also watched the same episode twice but one week apart, and the last (control) group did not watch the video. Tests of word meaning recognition and word meaning recall were administered before and after viewing (pretest-immediate posttest-delayed posttest). The pretest and posttests contained 23 target items and 17 distracters (single words and multi-word expressions). In addition, the study explored the influence of two learner factors, each related to one of two verbal input channels: sound recognition for the audio and reading efficacy (reading speed and comprehension) for the onscreen text. The results indicated significant vocabulary learning from viewing and slightly higher benefits for the spaced repetition group at immediate posttest. The results also showed a significant influence of previous target vocabulary knowledge and of aptitude, as measured by the LLAMA D test, but not of reading efficacy.

# Introduction

An increasing number of studies have demonstrated the benefits for language learning of viewing captioned videos, especially for vocabulary and comprehension (e.g. Montero Perez et  al., 2013; Pujadas & Muñoz,

2019), but more recently also for grammar (e.g. Lee & Révész, 2020), and pronunciation (Wisniewska & Mora, 2020). Theoretical explanations for these learning benefits rely on the multimodal characteristics of audiovisual input, namely the interaction between sound, image and onscreen text (see Vanderplank, 2016). Some of these studies have also addressed the role of input-related factors and a few have examined learner-related factors. Among the former, most have focused on the different types of on-screen text: subtitles (in the learners’ first language [L1]) and different types of captions (in the learners’ second language [L2]) (e.g. Montero Perez et  al., 2014, 2018; Wang, 2019), as well as on the effects of target item frequency (e.g. Fievez et  al., 2020; Rodgers, 2013). Research into other factors, such as input spacing in viewing, is only now starting to emerge (Pattemore & Muñoz, 2021), though its effects have been investigated in relation to deliberate vocabulary learning, e.g. through a mobile application (Seibert Hanson & Brown, 2019) and in reading studies (e.g. Serrano & Huang, 2018). To our knowledge, no previous study has specifically addressed lag effects in viewing, that is, the effect of different amounts of spacing between repeated viewings of the same video, though research has shown that repeated viewing can support comprehension and vocabulary learning (Webb, 2015). Moreover, repeated viewing is a common strategy among autonomous foreign/second language learners (see Vanderplank, 2020), who may watch the same video (TV programme, YouTube tutorial, etc.) more than once to increase global comprehension of the target language or to focus their attention on linguistic aspects, such as new vocabulary or pronunciation. Repeated viewing is also a common strategy among teachers to practice listening comprehension, often alternating viewings with and without captions (e.g. Kaderoğlu & Romeu, 2021).

Among learner-related factors, working memory (WM) and FL aptitude have received some recent attention (Kam et  al., 2020; Pattemore & Muñoz, 2020; Suárez & Gesa, 2019). Two unexplored factors are the learner’s auditory and reading skills, which are especially relevant for learning through captioned video because they are each related to one of the two verbal input channels in this multimodal input: the auditory channel and the written channel.

Based on these gaps within research on learning from audiovisual input, the present study aims to examine the effects on L2 vocabulary learning of the length of the interval between repeated exposures to the same video and the mediating role that learner’s auditory and reading skills may have.

# L2 vocabulary learning and repeated viewing

According to the principles of multimedia learning, learning is better when information is processed in spoken and written mode because learners make mental connections between the aural and visual information (provided there is temporal proximity) (Mayer, 2014). In the area of multimedia learning, however, studies of content learning in the L1 have argued that subtitles (in the same language) add redundant information, increasing extraneous or ineffective cognitive load (Mayer et  al., 2014). However, in acquisitional settings, when the language of the video is the target language, on-screen text can be seen as a tool to decrease extraneous cognitive load and increase germane cognitive load, improving learning by supporting the not yet automated learning process. In other words, subtitles and captions help L2 learners access word meanings while mapping the image with the spoken and written forms of the word. Thus, captions are seen as a tool to support the L2 learning process and as demanding less attentional effort (Kruger et  al., 2013).

The bulk of research into audiovisual input has focused on vocabulary learning and, especially, on the efficacy of captions on vocabulary learning (see the meta-analysis by Montero Perez et  al., 2013). An increasing number of studies are providing evidence that language learners can indeed pick up unfamiliar words from audiovisual input and that the provision of captions has the potential to increase the learning gains. To explain the learning potential of captions more specifically, it has also been suggested that captions help learners to decode and segment the speech stream and support the development of learners’ bottom-up listening processes. With higher decoding skills, learners have more time to interpret the message and to notice unknown words in the input (Charles & Trenkic, 2015).

Understandably, words that occur more frequently are more likely to be learnt faster. Indeed, numerous vocabulary studies have shown that repeated encounters with unknown words facilitate learning (e.g. Peters et  al., 2016), though the effects of frequency may be complex and frequency may interplay with several other factors (Uchihara et  al., 2019). Studies of incidental vocabulary learning have usually manipulated item frequency to provide multiple encounters with the target items (e.g. Pellicer-Sánchez, 2017). The ecological validity of such manipulated texts could be questioned and, nevertheless, in authentic texts it is impossible to control an item’s frequency of occurrence (Majuddin, 2020). This is even harder with videos. One way to present viewers with multiple encounters of target items has been to use many episodes of the same TV series (extensive viewing with a narrow viewing approach) (Webb, 2015) where the same vocabulary and grammatical constructions appear with higher frequency than in isolated programmes.

Another way to increase the number of encounters with unknown words is to increase the number of viewings of the same video. Only a few studies have used repeated viewing of usually short, or very short, educational clips, where repetition has been used to create different experimental conditions (subtitles/captions/no text) (e.g. Sydorenko, 2010; Winke et  al., 2010), but its effects have seldom been addressed (e.g. Hsieh, 2020). Exceptions include the study by Gass et  al. (2019), which suggested an explanation as to why students with higher WM tend to perform better in a comprehension task. According to these researchers, those students must have had higher proficiency and could successfully keep key information from the first viewing of the documentary in the episodic buffer of their WM. Then, during the second viewing, they could focus on the details rather than concentrating on the captions for meaning. Another exception is the study by Teng (2019) with primary school students, where he found that in each condition (full captioning, keyword captioning and no captioning) watching videos for the second time led to better performance in video comprehension than watching them once. Furthermore, the study showed that when the video was watched twice, the effectiveness of the fully captioned condition was excellent for global and detailed comprehension. Of special interest for the current paper is the study by Majuddin (2020), where two episodes from two different TV series were viewed once or twice (interestingly, piloting indicated that a third viewing no longer held participants’ attention). The study aimed at examining how repetition, operationalised as repeated viewing, influences the acquisition of multi-word expressions under two different conditions, incidental and intentional learning, as well as the role of caption enhancement under these two learning conditions. The participants were ESL learners who watched a video containing target multi-word expressions under one of six conditions, which differed in terms of caption condition (no captions, normal captions or enhanced captions) and the number of viewing times (once or twice). The study found that repeated viewing under all caption conditions led to better knowledge of form under the incidental learning conditions, and that the presence of enhanced captions reduced the number of viewings needed to make incidental gains in form recall knowledge. However, repeated viewing did not have any effect under the intentional learning conditions, which aligns well with the supposition that fewer encounters are needed for intentional learning than for incidental learning. On the other hand, neither repetition nor captioning had an effect on the acquisition of meanings. In sum, although there is limited research into repeated viewing, evidence is emerging of its potential benefits for enhancing comprehension (Gass et  al., 2019; Teng, 2019) and word form learning (Majuddin, 2020).

# The time lag between viewings

In the aforementioned studies with repeated viewing, the time lag between viewings has not been a matter of consideration and the second viewing was likely to immediately follow the first. However, there is some evidence from cognitive psychology studies of a lag effect (Rogers, 2017), indicating that longer spacing generally leads to better long-term retention than short spacing (Cepeda et  al., 2006).1 These studies typically examine paired-associate learning where participants are asked to memorise target words and their meanings. In L2 studies of decontextualised associative vocabulary learning, similar results have generally been found, favouring long spacing between encounters over shorter spacing or no spacing (the distributed practice effect) (e.g. Bahrick & Phelps, 1987; Nakata & Suzuki, 2019). However, this result was not replicated in two classroom studies with young learners that found an advantage of shorter spacing (1-day intersession interval) over longer spacing (8-day intersession interval) (Rogers & Cheung, 2018) or no differences between these two conditions (Rogers & Cheung, 2020).

Findings from recent, more naturalistic, L2 contextual word learning studies have also yielded inconsistent results. In a study of vocabulary learning during long continuous text, Elgort and Warren (2014) found benefits for learning of pseudowords when they appeared in the same book chapter, over repeated encounters across different chapters (longer lag), especially at lower proficiencies. The results of a reading-whilelistening study by Serrano and Huang (2018) revealed that a shorter lag (reading a text once every day for 5 consecutive days) led to more immediate vocabulary gains but a longer lag (reading the same text once every week for 5 consecutive weeks) led to greater long-term retention. In a partial replication and extension study on intentional vocabulary learning, Serrano and Huang (2021) confirmed the benefits for vocabulary learning of the short-spaced schedule (1-day intersession interval) over the long-spaced sessions (7-day intersession interval) on the immediate posttest; moreover, they found a significantly more positive effect of the short-spaced schedule than of the long-spaced on the delayed posttest as well. These mixed results show that the positive effects of long spacing are not always observed in studies of contextual vocabulary learning. However, it is difficult to compare the results of studies that operationalise shorter and longer spacing differently, since longer spacing in one study may be considered shorter spacing in another (Nakata & Elgort, 2021). Another problem for the comparison may be differences in intervals between testing and the final and initial treatment sessions (Rogers & Cheung, 2020; Webb & Chang 2015). More studies are warranted to confirm the positive effects of long spacing and the applicability of the lag effect to L2 contextual word learning. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no previous study has examined spacing, and specifically the time lag between repetitions, in contextual word learning from audiovisual input. As Rogers and Cheung (2020) point out, on a theoretical level, it is important to investigate lag effects in

L2 learning because of their strong connection with the benefits of repetition, review, and practice. Therefore, in the present study we aim to explore lag effects in viewing by addressing whether the timing of the second viewing, either immediately or in a different session a week later, has an influence on vocabulary learning through viewing.

# Learner factors

# Sound recognition as a component of language learning aptitude

FL learning aptitude generally refers to the specific talent for learning a foreign or second language (Carroll, 1981). From its inception, it was considered as an umbrella term consisting of a set of cognitive abilities: phonetic coding ability, grammatical sensitivity, inductive language learning ability and associative memory. Among all individual factors, FL aptitude, together with L2 motivation, have been repeatedly found to be the best predictors of L2 learning (e.g. Skehan, 2002).

However, despite the potential relevance that FL learning aptitude, and in particular the ability to recognise sound sequences in oral input, may have for learning through audiovisual input, very few audiovisual studies have measured it. Such studies have used the LLAMA battery of tests (Meara, 2005), an instrument that is increasingly being used, partly because it is language independent and freely available online. Suárez and Gesa (2019) used the LLAMA suit of tests (B, D, E, F) to investigate the possible effects of aptitude on intentional vocabulary learning from watching eight episodes of a TV series in class over 3 months; a set of target words were presented and taught before each session. The results revealed that the LLAMA total score was a significant predictor of meaning recognition learning but not of word form learning. The researchers suggested that meaning acquisition may have involved a greater cognitive involvement where FL learning aptitude may have come into play. Pattemore et al. (2021) explored the effect of FL learning aptitude (lower and higher), measured by LLAMA global score, in a study focusing on the learning of grammar constructions through captioned and uncaptioned video. They found that there was a significant effect of aptitude when the participants were presented with uncaptioned audiovisual input. Only those students with a higher language aptitude improved significantly in the posttest, suggesting that higher language learning aptitude is required to process uncaptioned video (the captioned group’s scores were not affected by the aptitude levels).

Current models of language learning aptitude emphasise its componential nature, which allows for differentiated levels of abilities in the aptitude profiles of L2 learners. Current models also emphasise the task-dependent nature of aptitude, which suggests that learners use different aptitude components to respond to different L2 learning processes (e.g. Skehan, 2002). LLAMA D, one of the four subtests in the LLAMA suite of tests, measures viewers’ ability to recognise repeated sounds in spoken language. This specific subtest was designed to measure how effectively the participant can recognise short segments of oral language to which they have been exposed previously, on the basis that such ability is considered a key skill for language learning (e.g. Service, 1992). The use of LLAMA D in studies of L2 learning through audiovisual input seems further justified by research suggesting that the LLAMA D may be a measure of aptitude for implicit learning (Granena, 2013) or for proceduralization (Suzuki, 2021). While more research is needed concerning such issues, the distinct nature of the LLAMA D subtest makes it particularly promising in the investigation of L2 learning from audiovisual input in a non-instructed and meaning-focused condition.

# Reading efficacy

The Dual-theoretical model of reading developed by Sadoski and Paivio (2013), on the basis of Paivio’s Dual Coding Theory (1986), provides an explanation for how poor low-level processing skills may hinder comprehension and learning from multimodal input. For example, when readers focus their effort and attention at lower linguistic levels (phonological and orthographic), if they encounter many unknown and grapho-phonemically irregular constructions, the associational and referential processing between the verbal and non-verbal codes will slow down. By the same token, even when L2 learners may first rely on previous knowledge and imagery to support comprehension, their inability to decode verbal information efficiently to test their assumptions may end in the creation of an incoherent mental model (Grabe & Stoller, 2013).

In L2 research, eye-tracking studies have shed some light on the processing of written text as one of the verbal components in multimodal input. Results have suggested that spending a significantly higher amount of time on the written text may be an indicator of lower L2-proficiency level and processing difficulties (e.g. Gass et  al., 2019; Tragant & Pellicer-Sánchez, 2019). This finding can be reinterpreted as evidence that effortful reading prevents a balance in the processing of verbal (visual and auditory-motor representations) and non-verbal (imagery) input, impeding comprehension and later recall (Sadoski & Paivio, 2013) and reducing the odds of learning from audiovisual input (Yeldham, 2018). However, viewers of captioned video need to read onscreen text with ease and speed to attain appropriate levels of comprehension, that is, they need to achieve suitable levels of reading efficacy (Llanes, 2018). In fact, although research in L2 learning through audiovisual input has not generally addressed the effects of viewers’ reading skills, one may assume that the level of reading efficacy needs to be higher for reading dynamic onscreen text than for reading static text. Therefore, it appears that examining viewers’ reading efficacy, integrating reading speed and comprehension, may contribute significantly to our understanding of the factors that affect the learning process and outcomes of learning through audiovisual input.

# Research questions

First, in order to examine the vocabulary learning potential of viewing captioned video, this study compares the participants who were exposed to a video twice to a control group that did not receive the treatment. Then, to address the gaps identified above, this study focuses on the lag effect in viewing comparing immediate repeated viewing and repeated viewing one week later. It also investigates the moderating role of learners’ L2 reading efficacy and of LLAMA D on vocabulary learning from viewing captioned videos. The specific research questions are:

1. To what extent can EFL learners learn new vocabulary from viewing a captioned video twice in the absence of a focus on vocabulary? That is, will there be differences between the learners exposed to a captioned video and those who are not?   
2. Are the effects of immediate or spaced repeated viewing different in the short term (immediate posttest) and in the long term (delayed posttest) for meaning recognition and recall? That is, is vocabulary knowledge better learnt and retained when repetition is immediate or a week apart?   
3. To what extent do meaning recognition and recall scores depend on treatment group (immediate repetition vs. spaced repetition), reading efficacy, and sound recognition skills?

# Method

# Participants

The participants in this study were 67 students (56 female) in an English language course that took place online because of the COVID pandemic, in a university department unit of English studies. The initial sample of 75 was reduced because of technical problems or lack of attendance. Approximately two thirds were Catalan-Spanish L1 speakers and one third had a different family language.2 Their average proficiency level was B2 as indicated by the tests taken in the previous course two months before.3 They were distributed into three groups: a spaced repetition group $\left( \mathtt { n } = 2 2 \right)$ , an immediate repetition group $( \mathtt { n } = 2 0 )$ , and a control group $\left( \mathrm { n } = 2 5 \right)$ ). The spaced repetition group viewed the TV series episode twice, one week apart. The immediate repetition group viewed the same episode twice in the same session. Neither group was informed that they would watch the video twice. The control group did not view the episode and only took the pretest and a posttest. Participants were given credits for their participation in the study.

# Materials

# Audio-visual input

The video used in the study was the second episode of the TV series “Fresh off the Boat”. This series had not been aired in Spanish TV and neither was it available in the usual streaming platforms (i.e. Netflix or Amazon Prime). The episode is 20 minutes 51 seconds long, so repeated viewing meant a total of slightly less than 42 minutes of exposure. The lexical profile of the video was analysed using the Range software (Nation & Heatley, 2002). The analysis showed that the episode reached an accumulated lexical coverage of $9 5 . 7 0 \%$ at the 3000 word-level plus proper nouns and marginal words, which ensured more than sufficient coverage, above the $9 0 - 9 5 \%$ threshold (Durbahn et  al., 2020), and adequate comprehension for the study participants (see also note 2). Furthermore, this episode had been previously used with university students with the same proficiency level (B2) (Majuddin, 2020; Pattemore & Muñoz, 2021) and with adolescents (A2-B1 proficiency level) (Pujadas & Muñoz, 2019).

# Target items

The pretest and posttests contained 40 items, 23 target items and 17 distracters (see Appendix 1). Words from the video that were likely to be unknown by most participants were selected as target items and the final list was decided after consulting with two of their English language teachers. Of the 23 target items, 9 were single words and 14 were multi-word expressions (lexical units larger than single words such as collocations, idioms, and phrasal verbs). Multi-word expressions likely to be unfamiliar to the participants were included to increase the lexical difficulty of the treatment. Most items appeared only once (twice with the second viewing). As distracters, we used words from texts used in the previous language course two months earlier to encourage participants’ engagement (Webb & Chang, 2015); 5 were single words and 12 were multi-word expressions.

# Instruments

Sound recognition test.  The sound recognition skills of the participants in the two treatment groups were measured by means of the LLAMA D (specifically, LLAMA_D3 test, “Listening for new words”; Meara & Rogers, 2019). Test takers listen to a sound sequence (“a word”) and decide whether they have heard the word before or not (50 items in total). The rationale is that recognising that a sequence of sounds is something which you have heard before makes it easier to remember and attach a meaning to it.

Reading efficacy test.    To measure the reading efficacy of the participants in the two treatment groups, a text about student life and technology was adapted and shortened for the purposes of this study (501 running words). It was taken from a textbook (Chilton et  al., 2017) for B2-level learners matching the participants’ proficiency level. The comprehension questions were adapted so that correct answers could only be extracted from the text, which would be read only once. The final poll of items consisted of 6 multiple-choice questions, 3 focused on textually explicit/ literal information and 3 on textually implicit information (requiring the connection of different statements within the text but not considering L2 readers’ knowledge of the world or background knowledge; see Alderson, 2000). Each test item had a single correct answer, three distracters, and the Don’t-know option to reduce guessing. This version was pilot tested with two EFL learners from the same proficiency level and an EFL teacher with the aim of assessing the quality of the items and anticipating any possible drawbacks; as a result, the wording of one of the questions was reformulated to improve the clarity.

The evidence obtained from this measure was reading speed (WPM $= \ [ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } ^ { \circ }$ of words in the text/number of seconds used to read the whole passage] $^ { | * } 6 0 \rrangle$ ) and comprehension, separately. Each comprehension question was assigned one point $( = ~ 6$ points in total). Then, the raw comprehension score was used to calculate the percentage of comprehension (number of correct answers $^ { * } 1 0 0 / 6$ ). Finally, the formula used to calculate reading efficacy was: $( \mathrm { W P M } \times \%$ comprehension)/100.

Vocabulary tests.    In the meaning recall test participants had to translate the L2 TWs and distracters into Spanish or Catalan or explain the meaning in English. The average internal consistency coefficients were good (Cronbach’s alpha $= . 7 7$ for pretest and delayed posttest; .86 for the immediate posttest). The meaning recognition test had a multiple-choice format. For each test item, participants were asked to tick off the correct answer from four Spanish translation options (from the same word class); see the example below. A Don’t-know option was included to reduce guessing. The average internal consistency coefficients of the pretest and posttests were very good (Cronbach’s alpha $\qquad = \quad . 8 6$ for pretest; .89 for immediate posttest; .87 for delayed posttest).

Example of multiple-choice test item:

# SLANDER

a. fealdad (ugliness) b. elogio (praise) c. esbeltez (slenderness) d. calumnia e. I don’t know

# Procedure

Before the intervention, all the participants took the pre-tests: the meaning recall test and the meaning recognition test on the Moodle platform (from their home) in the same session during regular classroom hours;4 they were presented as initial tests administered at the beginning of the course.

One month later, the intervention took place through the Zoom application, with cameras on at all times. The connection with the previous tests was not explicitly made by the researchers. EdPuzzle was used to view the videos and answer three comprehension questions that were unrelated to the target items at the end of the first viewing (these questions were not analysed but ensured participants were on task and had an adequate comprehension). The use of this website guaranteed that participants did not open another tab or window, which would have stopped the video, and allowed the researcher to monitor the viewing progression of each participant through the website viewing bar.

Participants were distributed for each session in subgroups (1–6 participants) who met with one of the researchers with their computer cameras on. In the first session (first week), the spaced repetition subgroups viewed the video once and answered the comprehension questions. Then they took the reading efficacy test and the LLAMA D test. In the second session, the following week, they viewed the video again and then took the two posttests (meaning recall, meaning recognition).

In this second week the subgroups in the immediate repetition condition viewed the video twice. After the first viewing, they answered the three comprehension questions, and then watched the video again. After the second viewing, they took the posttests, which ensured that all the participants took the tests on the same week. The following week the immediate repetition condition subgroups took the reading efficacy test and the LLAMA D test.

The posttest was re-administered on the Moodle platform as a delayed posttest approximately 4.5 weeks after the immediate posttest5 . It contained the meaning recall and meaning recognition tests. For the control group this was the only posttest.

# Test administration

Vocabulary tests were administered online on the Moodle platform. Participants were given 14 minutes to complete the meaning recall test (20 seconds per item), and 10 minutes to complete the meaning recognition test (15 seconds per item). This sequence was followed to avoid test effects. They could not go back to the previous items in either test and the items were presented in a randomised order for each participant and occasion. This, together with the time pressure imposed that did not allow for opening tabs or looking for words, ensured that participants could not share answers or consult the Internet.

For the reading efficacy test, students were first instructed to silently read the text once, at their own pace, to achieve comprehension. The text was available on the Moodle platform in a form that accurately registered the amount of time each participant spent reading the text. Once each participant finished reading the text, they were asked to open another form to answer a set of multiple-choice questions; access to the previous form was automatically blocked. The test was taken in small groups via Zoom with one of the researchers monitoring the participants’ progress and ensuring they remained solely focused on the test.

LLAMA D was accessed by participants at the Lognostics Tools website (http://www.lognostics.co.uk/tools). On completion, the score was saved on the website.6

# Analysis and results

The data analysis was run in the SPSS version 27 statistical package. First, for the preliminary analysis, the data was checked for normality with Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov values. Then, several analyses of variance were run to ensure that the treatment and control groups had comparable pretest scores. Finally, several independent samples t-tests were run to ensure that the two treatment groups (immediate, spaced) were comparable in terms of their LLAMA D and reading efficacy scores. To answer the first research question two General Linear Models (GLMs) were fitted with the meaning recognition (or meaning recall for the second model) immediate posttest scores as a dependent variable, and group (control, immediate, spaced) and pre-test scores as independent variables. The control group’s scores were analysed only for this first research question as the rest of the questions addressed differences between the treatment groups. To answer the second research question, two Linear Models for Repeated Measures were fitted with aggregated (pretest scores, immediate posttest scores, and delayed posttest scores in one column) meaning recognition scores (or meaning recall scores for the second model) as a dependent variable, and time of testing (pretests, immediate posttest, delayed posttest), and group (immediate, spaced) as independent variables. To answer the third research question two GLMs were fitted with the meaning recognition (or meaning recall for the second model) immediate posttest scores as a dependent variable, and meaning recognition/meaning recall pretest scores, group (immediate, spaced), reading efficacy scores, and aptitude group (lower, higher) as independent variables.

First of all, normality tests indicated that the global sample and group samples were normally distributed. The Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov values were non-significant and skewness and kurtosis were acceptable. There was one outlier in one of the pretests and the score was changed to be one unit below the next lowest score. The first analysis explored whether the study groups were comparable at the onset of the experiment. There was no significant difference between the three groups in the pretest for neither meaning recognition $\left( \operatorname { F } ( 2 , 6 9 ) = . 6 1 0 \right)$ , $ { p ^ { \mathrm { ~ = ~ } } } . 5 4 6$ , $\eta _ { p } ^ { ~ 2 } = . 0 1 8 )$ nor meaning recall (F $( 2 , 6 6 ) =$ .303, $ { p }  { = } . 7 4 0$ , ${ \eta _ { p } } ^ { 2 } = . 0 0 9 ,$ ). Neither did the two treatment groups differ in their LLAMA D scores (t $( 4 9 ) ~ = ~ - . 2 1 7 .$ , $p \ = . 8 2 9$ , $d = - . 0 6 1 )$ ) and reading efficacy scores t $( 4 8 ) = - . 3 1 0$ , $ { p }  { = } ~ . 7 5 8$ , $d = - . 0 8 8$ ) (see Table 1).

To answer the first research question, we compared the immediate posttest scores of the two treatment groups with the posttest score of the control group. See descriptive statistics in Tables 2 and 3, for meaning recognition and meaning recall of the treatment groups, and Table 4 for scores of the control group.

A General Linear Model (GLM) was fitted in SPSS with the meaning recognition immediate posttest scores as a dependent variable, and group and pre-test scores as factors. The model revealed a significant effect of group $( \mathrm { F } ( 2 , 7 0 ) ~ = ~ 5 . 3 4 1$ , $ { p } =  { } . 0 0 7$ , ${ \eta _ { p } } ^ { 2 } ~ = ~ . 1 3 9 )$ and pretest scores $( \mathrm { F } ( 1 , 7 0 ) = 9 9 . 5 0 9$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $\eta _ { p } ^ { ~ 2 } = ~ . 6 0 1 )$ . The Bonferroni post-hoc comparison showed that the two treatment groups scored higher than the control group: the spaced repetition group significantly higher $\left( \boldsymbol { p } = . 0 0 9 \right)$ , and the immediate repetition group marginally so $\left( \boldsymbol { p } = . 0 6 2 \right)$ . As for the meaning recall results, a GLM showed a significant effect of group $( \mathrm { F } ( 2 , 6 4 ) ~ = ~ 4 . 3 6 2$ , $p \ = . 0 1 7$ , $\eta _ { p } ^ { ~ 2 } ~ = ~ . 1 2 7 )$ and pre-test scores $( \mathrm { F } ( 1 , 6 4 ) ~ =$ 71.068, $p \ < . 0 0 1$ , $\eta _ { p } ^ { ~ 2 } = . 5 4 2 )$ . The post-hoc comparison revealed a significant advantage of the spaced repetition group over the control group $\left( \boldsymbol { p } = . 0 1 6 \right)$ , and no significant difference between the immediate repetition and control groups $( p = . 2 4 3 )$ .

The second research question addressed the effects of immediate and spaced repeated viewing in the short term (as measured by an immediate posttest) and in a longer term (as measured by a delayed posttest taken 4.5 weeks later). As regards meaning recognition, a Linear Model for Repeated Measures was fitted with aggregated meaning recognition scores as a dependent variable, time of testing (pretest, immediate posttest, and delayed posttest) and group as fixed factors. The model also included an interaction between time and group. The results showed that time was a significant factor $\left( \mathrm { F } ( 2 , 1 3 2 ) = 2 9 . 2 4 5 \right.$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p < . 0 0 1 , } \end{array}$ , but neither group $\left( \operatorname { F } ( 1 , 1 3 2 ) \ = . 2 4 4 \right)$ , $p = . 6 2 2 ,$ ), nor group by time interaction $\left( \mathrm { F } ( 2 , \ 1 3 2 ) \ = \right.$ .440, $\begin{array} { r } { p = 6 4 5 , } \end{array}$ ) reached statistical significance.

The pairwise comparison between the times of testing revealed that all participants as a group significantly improved between the pretest and immediate posttest $( { \mathrm { t } } ( 1 3 2 ) = 5 . 6 2 4 $ , $\begin{array} { r } { p \ < \ . 0 0 1 \ r _ { \cdot } } \end{array}$ ), between the pretest and delayed posttest $\left( \mathrm { t } ( 1 3 2 ) = 7 . 3 1 9 \right.$ , $\textstyle P < . 0 0 1 )$ , and between the immediate posttest and the delayed posttest $( { \mathrm { t } } ( 1 3 2 ) = 2 . 1 9 5$ , $p \ = \ . 0 3 0 ^ { \cdot }$ ). See Figure 1.

As regards the meaning recall scores, the same procedure was followed. We fitted a Linear Model for Repeated Measures with meaning recall test scores as a dependent variable, and time and group as fixed factors. The results showed a significant effect of time of testing (F(2,

The pairwise comparison showed that all participants significantly improved between the pretest and both immediate $( \mathrm { t } ( 1 1 0 ) = 6 . 2 6 7$ , $\textit { p } <$ .001) and delayed $( \mathrm { t } ( 1 1 0 ) = 4 . 4 9 5$ , $\textstyle P \ < \ . 0 0 1 { \mathrm { ~ } }$ ) posttests, but there was no significant difference between the immediate posttest and delayed posttest $( \mathrm { t } ( 1 1 0 ) = 1 . 4 8 6$ , $p = . 1 4 0 \rangle$ , though scores were lower at delayed posttest. See Figure 2.

The third research question addressed the lag effect, represented by the immediate repetition and spaced repetition groups, together with the effects of reading efficacy and sound recognition skills on learners’ meaning recognition and meaning recall scores. The LLAMA D scores were split at the median creating two categories: high and low aptitude (the relationship of this variable with outcomes was not linear). For meaning recognition, a General Linear Model was fitted with immediate posttest meaning recognition scores as a dependent variable, and pretest scores, treatment group, reading efficacy scores, and aptitude group as fixed factors. The results showed that there was no significant effect of group $\operatorname { \rho } ( \operatorname { F } ( 1 ) = . 0 8 5$ , $p = . 7 7 2 ,$ ) or reading efficacy $( \mathrm { F } ( 1 ) = . 0 0 1$ , $p = . 9 7 0 \rangle$ ). There was a significant effect of pretest (prior knowledge) $( \mathrm { F } ( 1 ) = 5 9 . 8 9 1$ ,

# Discussion

This study examined the effects of viewing a captioned video on vocabulary learning, focusing on the effects of repeated viewing in relation to the time lag between viewings as well as the role played by two factors, sound recognition and reading efficacy, each connected to one of the audiovisual verbal input modes. As regards the first research question, the results of the immediate posttest show that participants in the two treatment groups had higher vocabulary gains than the participants in the control group, who did not watch the video. Though modest, the gains observed in the current study are noteworthy because most target items were encountered only twice across the two viewings, the total length of exposure to the video was limited to 42 minutes, and participants were not asked to focus on vocabulary. This result is generally consistent with previous viewing studies that found evidence of L2 vocabulary learning from captioned videos (e.g. Montero Perez et  al., 2013; Peters & Webb, 2018; Pujadas & Muñoz 2019; Rodgers, 2013). The result is also consistent with the only other previous study of repeated viewing, although Majuddin (2020) found gains in the acquisition of form of multi-word expressions, but not in the acquisition of meaning. However, in Majuddin’s study the comparison was between one viewing and two viewings, whereas the comparison addressed by our first research question is between two viewings and no viewing (control group), hence larger differences in meaning learning could be expected. The benefits for L2 learning of audiovisual input can be seen in light of its multimodality and the mental connections that are created between aural and visual information when input is processed in spoken and written mode (e.g. Mayer, 2014). This finding supports the claim that the combination of three sources of input in captioned videos, with accompanying (redundant) text, results in linguistic benefits such as vocabulary learning for L2 learners.

Regarding the performance of the two different treatment groups compared with the control group, the results suggest that under the conditions of this treatment, spaced repetition (a week apart in this study) may be more beneficial than immediate repetition for both aspects of word meaning knowledge, as measured by an immediate posttest. However, this advantage does not seem to be substantial enough (see below). The higher gains observed on the meaning recognition test are in line with previous findings in the area of vocabulary from written input showing word learning outcomes vary depending on the type of test used (Waring & Takaki, 2003). Specifically, learners tend to obtain higher scores in recognition than in recall tests, as meaning recall is the most difficult aspect of word knowledge to acquire (e.g. Pellicer-Sánchez, 2017).

In answer to the second research question, the results show that pretest score was the only significant factor in vocabulary learning and that neither group nor time by group interaction were significant. This suggests that the effects on L2 vocabulary learning of an immediate repetition and a (1-week) spaced repetition of a captioned video are rather similar. As seen above, previous results from studies of contextual word learning are conflicting. Some evidence has been found in studies of reading-while-listening of a more positive effect of the longer lag in the long term and of shorter lag in the short term, for incidental learning (Serrano & Huang, 2018). In contrast, for intentional learning an advantage of the shorter lag on both the immediate and delayed posttest has been found (Serrano & Huang, 2021). Comparisons are also made difficult by the dearth of previous research on input spacing examining the effects of immediate repetition. In fact, the short spacing condition in most previous studies had a 1-day intersession interval (e.g. Rogers & Cheung, 2018; Serrano & Huang, 2021) and the effects of overnight consolidation after training may have enhanced learning and retention (e.g. Davis et  al., 2009). Neither have the lag effects in audiovisual input been investigated previously. In sum, more studies on the lag effects of viewing repetition are needed to throw light on the ways in which the different spacing conditions (i.e. shorter or longer lags between sessions and between the last session and the delayed posttest) may affect learning from audiovisual input. More research is also needed to determine to what extent the findings from deliberate learning can be extended to contextual learning through viewing captioned videos.

Alternatively, an explanation for the similar results of the two treatment groups in the present study may lie in the support provided by the captions, which have made language items on the screen salient for the viewers, neutralizing potential lag effects. Several recent viewing studies have found that in the presence of captions, other potentially mediating factors, such as WM, do not have a significant impact (Pattemore & Muñoz, 2020; Suárez et  al., 2021), and it has been argued that captions have a neutralizing effect on WM limitations (Wiley et  al., 2014). This aligns with the assumption that captions ease the WM load by distributing the information among the auditory, textual, and visual channels (see Vanderplank, 2016). Similarly, the results of a meta-analysis (Uchihara et  al., 2019) suggested that frequency of encounters with words in incidental vocabulary learning through viewing has a weaker impact than in monomodal input (reading or listening), because of the support provided by the combination of on-screen text and image. It may be interesting to explore the lag effects on repeated viewing without captions to see if viewing audiovisual materials without any textual support is more sensitive to lag effects.

Another result to note from this analysis is that the delayed posttest score for meaning recognition of the immediate repetition group was higher than the score at the immediate posttest. This was unexpected because the form-meaning links formed through the intervention could not be very strong after so few encounters (Hulstijn, 2001) and were prone to memory decay after 4 weeks. Thus, this finding appears to indicate that those gains cannot be only attributable to the treatment (Peters & Webb, 2018). Hence, one may assume that some participants in the immediate repetition group paid attention to the unknown items encountered in the first posttest and looked them up afterwards. Outside learning between tests is a well-known methodological problem that might only be prevented through the use of nonwords, which diminishes the ecological validity of the results. Clearly this finding needs to be examined through further research.

The third research question confronted the effects of spacing with the auditory- and reading-related factors. As before, treatment group – that is, immediate repetition or spaced repetition group – was not shown to be a significant predictor. Neither did reading efficacy show a significant effect. However, this factor was significant in a model that did not include pretest scores, suggesting that previous vocabulary knowledge was outweighing reading efficacy. In fact, there was an association between these two variables $( \mathrm { r } = \mathrm { . } 5 9 5 ^ { \ast \ast }$ and . $5 7 6 ^ { * * }$ , for meaning recognition and meaning recall, respectively), though collinearity values were low $( < . 3 )$ . It may be suggested that reading efficacy could be a better predictor for lower proficiency levels than those of the participants in this study, who already had a large vocabulary and extended practice with reading English texts for their degree. As regards sound recognition skills, the analysis showed that this factor had a significant effect on outcomes, but only in the meaning recognition test. This is consistent with the findings by Suárez and Gesa (2019), who found effects of aptitude on meaning gains through a meaning recall test. However, they did not use a meaning recogniyion test and it cannot be concluded that aptitude has varying effects on different aspects of word knowledge from the scant extant evidence. Further research is warranted to explore the effects of aptitude on learning through audiovisual input. In particular, the exploration of the skills measured by LLAMA D for different proficiency-level learners seems highly promising (see Skehan, 2002). Finally, the only factor that emerged as strongly significant for both meaning recognition and recall was pretest scores as in the previous analysis. This is in line with other vocabulary studies of incidental learning of single words and multiple word expressions from written and audiovisual input (e.g. Majuddin, 2020; Peters & Webb, 2018), and confirms that previous vocabulary knowledge has a strong impact on learning gains and the processing of multimodal input.

# Conclusion

Recent research has suggested that viewing L2 captioned audiovisual input brings benefits to L2 vocabulary learning. Based on these research findings the current study explored the effects of repeated viewing of audiovisual input – a frequent practice among teachers who use videos in the classroom and among autonomous learners who seek to improve their L2 proficiency. To our knowledge this is the first study to focus on the effects that the length of the interval between repetitions may have on vocabulary learning. The results suggested a modest advantage of the spaced repetition condition in comparison with the control group but no difference between the two treatment groups. Therefore, they did not fully support the lag effect often observed in decontextualised paired-associate word learning. An alternative explanation for our findings is that captions neutralised the potential impact of lag effects. Therefore, further research is needed to examine lag effects with non-captioned video viewing and uncover the optimal lag between repetitions. The study also explored the effects of L2 reading efficacy and of sound recognition skills, as measured by the LLAMA D. The effects of the latter on the meaning recognition scores indicates that, in the conditions of the present study, this aptitude component plays a significant role in the acquisition of word meaning.

From a methodological point of view, the study was innovative in that data was collected online, through the Moodle platform for whole group tests (eg., pretest) and through Zoom for the intervention with small groups (of usually four participants). The website EdPuzzle guaranteed that while viewing the videos participants did not open another tab and allowed the researcher to monitor the viewing progression of each participant through a viewing bar. The use of computer cameras, timed tests, randomized order of items for each participant and occasion, and restrictions such as not being able to go back to previous items, ensured as much as possible the validity of the tests.

The study is not without limitations. In the first place, the final sample size is small, which may have obscured the effects of the intervention. A second limitation of the study, common to research that includes delayed posttests, is the lack of control of outside learning in between the immediate and the delayed posttests. Related to this, the participants were majoring in English and some may have been motivated to engage in deliberate learning after the immediate posttest. Another possible limitation is that there were not aural prompts in the tests. However, current consensus points to benefits of captioned video regardless of whether this learning is assessed by means of aural or written test prompts (Jelani & Boers, 2018). Finally, further research is needed to investigate the role of word frequency and possible differences in learning single words and multiple word expressions (see Puimège & Peters, 2019) in this study.

Research into repeated viewing may provide useful recommendations for autonomous learners and pedagogical implications for teachers. Teachers already use repetitions to alternate viewings with and without captions so as to guide learners’ focus of attention while viewing. In addition, learners and teachers may consider spacing viewings out, as our research suggests this will improve vocabulary gains. More generally, teachers may consider the results of research into lag effects to implement the conditions that may lead to more efficient and effective L2 practice in the short and longer term (see Rogers & Cheung, 2021).

# Notes

1. The lag effect is related to the spacing effect (Rogers, 2017) and both are generally referred to as distributed practice effect. However, while the lag effect is concerned with the effects of different amounts of spacing – as in the present study, the spacing effect refers to the effects of spacing and no spacing (i.e. massing), as when target items are repeated n times in a row.   
2. Many of these multilingual learners were also proficient in Catalan and Spanish, having been schooled wholly or partly in these languages. For those who chose so, we allowed them to give translations to their L1 (we had a few answers in Italian and Romanian). No differences were found between them and learners whose family language was Catalan or/and Spanish.   
3. Their vocabulary size was 7055 words on average (SD: 1325) as measured by the Yes/No Levels Test (Meara & Miralpeix, 2017). Vocabulary size was not included in the analysis because, due to practical problems, it was measured after the viewing sessions. However, it gives us a good approximation of the participants’ vocabulary knowledge and ensures their comprehension of the language in the video.   
4. Because of the COVID pandemic, this was the third semester these students were taking their courses online and they were familiar with the format by then.   
5. It has been argued that the optimal spacing between training or studying sessions is related to the interval between study and test, and that the former should be $1 0 { - } 3 0 \%$ of the latter, approximately (Cepeda et al, 2008). In the present study, the immediate posttest did not leave any interval between session and test, but the formula could be applied to the interval between sessions (7 days) and the delayed posttest (32 days) and this combination approximates the optimal ratio at $2 2 \%$ .   
6. We are very grateful to Paul Meara for his kind help providing the scores.
