Although many studies modelled writing quality by analysing basic skills (spelling, grammar, etc.), few focused on top-down compositional strategies at the discourse level. We propose that using both narrative and argument discourse modes in an argumentative essay (a multi-discourse mode [MDM] strategy) capitalizes on their complementary advantages, yielding higher quality argumentative essays. We tested whether MDM strategy and linguistic features were linked to essay scores in 695 Chinese high-stakes exam essays by upper secondary school students. Path analyses showed that essays with the MDM strategy had higher scores. MDM essays also featured more words, shorter sentences, more infrequent words, and more concrete words—all contributing to higher essay scores. Additionally, essays written from a picture prompt (versus a text prompt) had higher scores. This study captures how discourse strategies can improve essay writing.

# INTRODUCTION

Writing is an important social and cognitive skill that affects students’ academic and professional performance and outcomes (Bazerman et al. 2018; Ferretti and Graham 2019). However, few students write well; only 27 per cent of 8th- and 12th-grade students in the USA wrote proficiently and 20 per cent of them lacked basic writing skills, with no improvement across a decade (NCE 2012). According to cognitive models of writing development, the development of written composition typically progresses from (i) answers to wh-questions or expressing author knowledge (knowledge telling), to (ii) organizing and integrating ideas to actively constitute knowledge for the author’s benefit (knowledge transforming), and to (iii) considering how audience(s) might interpret the text to inform planning, reviewing, and revision of it (knowledge crafting; Kellogg 2008; Bereiter and Scardamalia 2013). During knowledge crafting, skilled writers routinely revise texts and might make structural changes to aid readers (Sommers 1980). However, not everyone attains this last stage of knowledge crafting (Kellogg 2008; Bereiter and Scardamalia 2013).

From a process perspective, good writing involves conceptualizing ideas, organizing them into a coherent plan, translating them into text, and reviewing and revising the written translation (Hayes and Flower 1986; Kellogg 2008; Graham 2018). In addition to linguistic knowledge, this process involves writers’ top-down conceptual skills and sociocultural knowledge (e.g. schematic, pragmatic, register, and world knowledge). Hence, understanding advanced top-down writing strategies is critical for improving the instructions and assessment of writing, which can, in turn, inform student learning. However, most studies, particularly those on automatic essay scoring (AES) systems, focus on lexico-grammatical indices or extracting bottom-up linguistic features; few focus on how top-down compositional strategies or discourse features (e.g. rhetoric, cohesion [McNamara et al. 2015], style or register [Biber et al. 2016]) affect essay quality (Deane 2011, 2013).

Thus, this study theoretically proposes a new construct, a multi-discourse mode (MDM) strategy, and empirically tests its effects on student essays. Specifically, we define MDM strategy as integrating or moving between multiple discourse modes (e.g. narrative and argumentation; Smith, 2003) in writing. Then, we discuss the benefits and costs of using a MDM strategy. Notably, a MDM strategy can achieve the respective rhetorical purpose of each discourse mode within a single written text (e.g. narratives, recount events, and arguments persuade audiences). We test whether essays with both narrative and argument discourse modes differ from essays with only one discourse mode in (i) overall essay score, or (ii) essay attributes (total words, sentence length, concreteness, and word frequency). We use high-stakes examination essays by 695 high school seniors (12th graders).

# THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

# Discourse modes and a multi-discourse mode strategy

Smith (2001, 2003, 2013) introduced the notion of discourse modes: levels of local text structures with distinguishable linguistic forms. Discourse modes’ linguistic forms include temporal and aspectual properties of verb classes, such as verbs indicating events and states (e.g. go, run, plan) and verbs indicating abstract knowledge and beliefs (e.g. think, believe, feel). For example, narrative discourse contains situational verbs concerning specific events located in and organized by time (see Table 1). Conversely, argumentative discourse contains regular patterns and verbs concerning abstract knowledge or beliefs. The linguistic forms of discourse modes also include indicators of clause-level progression. For example, a temporal sequence of narration can progress clauses in time and space/location (e.g. ‘One morning, Little Red Riding Hood set off from home to visit her grandmother. Along the way in the woods, she noticed some lovely flowers …’). An argument can locate and progress clauses metaphorically through a domain via, for example, reasoning from premises to conclusions (e.g. ‘Smith promises to cut taxes for the poor, and my wages are low, so I’ll be voting for her.’). Hence, discourse modes can be classified according to these linguistic forms.

Smith (2003) posited five common discourse modes in written texts: narrative, descriptive, reporting, informative, and argumentative/commentary. Discourse modes often align with genres. For example, the narrative discourse mode is paramount in the narrative fiction genre and the argumentative–commentary discourse mode is common in the editorial genre; however, a text can employ multiple discourse modes (‘the discourse modes cut across genre lines’; Smith 2001: 185). For example, the paragraph below transitions from an argumentative to a narrative mode (using an MDM strategy):

[Argument:] I feel reasonably certain of the final verdict on the current impeachment affair because I think history will see it as the climax of a six-year period marred by a troubling and deepening failure of the Republican party to play within the established constitutional rules. [Narrative:] It was on Election Night 1992, not very far into the evening, that the Senate minority leader, Bob Dole, hinted at the way his party planned to conduct itself in the months ahead: it would filibuster any significant legislation the new Democratic President proposed, forcing him to obtain 60 votes for Senate passage (Ehrenhalt 1998, cited in Smith 2001: 203, notation added at the beginning of the sentences).

The first sentence employs an argumentative discourse mode with a first-person proposition of belief (‘I feel …’), supported by reasoning using another belief (‘because I think …’). Then, it shifts to a narrative discourse mode in the second sentence; this is marked by temporality and events related by verb tense and aspects (‘It was …’) that are common in story narrative genres. Smith (2001) argues that transitions between discourse modes are universal across languages.

A social practice approach to language learning (Barton 2007) might explain the origin of students’ MDM writing strategies. Language learning often occurs when people use language in their daily lives rather than in a vacuum or in the order of grammatical forms taught at school (Barton and Lee 2013; Barton and Potts 2013). In addition to classroom instructions in school, students constantly engage in meaning-making processes on social media, reading and writing with text, images, videos, and emojis combined in a single text (i.e. multimodal texts, Jewitt and Kress 2003; Bateman et al. 2017; Bezemer and Cowan 2021). This multimodal literacy shapes how students learn and use language (Kress 2003; Kress and Rowsell 2018). For example, the traditionally separate genre activities of viewing and producing picture sharing, story narration, and commentary making now often occur in integrated genre activities on social platforms (e.g. Instagram, TikTok, Tweets, WhatsApp, and Youtube). Such social practices might increase students’ use of MDM strategies, particularly regarding the combination of narrative and argument discourse modes in students’ writing; online video/picture sharing often accompanies story narration (mainly narrative discourse) and commentary (mainly argument discourse) together (see an example in Figure 1).

# Advantages of using a multi-discourse mode strategy

An MDM strategy capitalizes on the complementary strengths of each discourse mode. For example, argumentative writing aims to inform and persuade readers; thus, reasoning is paramount (Perkins et al. 1991; Walton 2005). Conversely, narrative recounts a plot of events in a specific way (tellability, Brunner 1991) to be comprehensible, memorable, and persuasive and to arouse emotions (Labov and Waletzky 2003). The detailed particulars of a narrative discourse mode can support the reasoning process and strengthen the claims of the argument (Bruner 1991). Consider the following argument discourse mode with Toulmin’s (2003) argument structures.

Claim: Honest people tend to be more successful.   
Evidence: They often get more opportunities and make more money than dishonest people.   
Warrant: Companies try to hire and promote honest people.   
Backing: Companies do not want their employees to cheat them.   
Rebuttal: However, some employees successfully hide their dishonesty.

In this example, the writer draws our attention to a claim and its evidence, warrant, backing, and rebuttal (Toulmin 2003). It begins with a claim (honest people tend to be more successful) for which there is possible counter or opposing claims (debatable claim, Stein and Miller 1993). Then, the writer presents observational evidence to support the claim (they often get more opportunities and make more money than dishonest people). This evidence is warranted by another observation (companies try to hire and promote honest people) and backed by a reason (companies do not want their employees to cheat them). Finally, the claim ends with a rebuttal invoking contradictory evidence in favour of an opposing claim (some employees successfully hide their dishonesty).

Figure 1: An example of multimodal text, ‘the face of guilt’. Notes. Shared by DOG@ Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/p/CcD4WjCJIUe/) on 8 April 2022. The left of the figure is a photo with the title ‘the face of guilt’, in which a golden retriever is holding a teddy toy with a guilty face. The caption on the photo says, ‘When dad has to go back in the store to pay for the toy he didn’t notice you grabbed and carried out…’ [narrative discourse mode]. The right of the figure shows laughing emojis and textual commentaries from others (e.g. ‘Dogs don’t have rights, so can’t be held accountable for theft’ [argument discourse mode]).

Next, consider this story of young George Washington and the cherry tree within Labov’s narrative structures (Labov and Waletzky 2003):

Orientation: When George was six years old, he had an axe, and chopped everything in his way.   
Temporal organization: When George’s dad saw his favourite cherry tree chopped down, he angrily asked, ‘who did it?’ George hesitated but said, ‘I can’t tell a lie, Pa; I cut it.’

To George’s surprise, his dad praised him, ‘Your honesty is worth more than a thousand trees.’

Coda: Being honest is a golden character in young George. He stayed honest and true, eventually becoming the first US president.

In this example, the narrative contains a temporally ordered sequence of situational particulars that answer wh-questions (e.g. who, when, what: George, six years old, chopped down the cherry tree); thus, readers who are familiar with most of the particulars can readily understand it (comprehensible). Readers can store this sequence of particulars in episodic and long-term memories within their cerebral cortex (memorable). The expressed emotional particulars (angrily, hesitated, surprise) arouses the reader’s emotions and motivations, linking their memories stored in the cerebral cortex to their emotions in the amygdala (emotional arousal). Finally, the coda uses elements such as morality (being honest is a golden character in young George) and implications (he stayed honest and true, eventually becoming the first US president) to transmit moral models concerning social situations, thereby promoting social values (persuasion, Deane et al. 2015). Thus, the tellability of this narrative coheres with the rhetorical purpose of the argument.

An MDM strategy is a deliberate top-down organization strategy for writing an essay. A discourse strategy that uses both argument and narrative enjoys the rhetorical benefits of the complementary strengths of each. Consider the following example:

[multi-discourse mode strategy with argument followed by narrative] Honest people tend to be more successful. As companies don’t want their employees to cheat them, they try to hire honest people (though some employees successfully hide their dishonesty). Also, honest people are often regarded as trustworthy at work, so they get more opportunities for promotion, compared to dishonest people. It’s like ‘George Washington and the cherry tree’. The six-year-old George stayed honest and true after he chopped down his father’s cherry tree. His father praised his honesty, and he eventually becomes the first US president. [Moral implications:] So, be honest to succeed.

In this MDM strategy example, the argument in the first three sentences is followed by a narrative (the subsequent four sentences), which strengthens the episodic memory effects to make the argument’s reasoning more memorable, comprehensible, emotionally arousing, and persuasive. After the narrative, further argumentation explicitly specifies the narrative’s moral implications (be honest to succeed), making the essay more persuasive (Labov and Waletzky 2003). Therefore, we hypothesized that MDM essays outscore single-discourse essays (H-1):

H-1. Essays with an MDM strategy have higher scores than those with a single-discourse mode strategy.

To date, no published study investigated the relationship between the use of MDM strategy and student essay scores. As discussed above, the MDM essays enjoy the rhetorical benefits of employing the narrative’s situational particulars to make an argument more memorable and more persuasive. Hence, we predict that essays with MDMs have higher scores than those with a single-discourse mode.

# Disadvantages of the multi-discourse mode strategy

Although an MDM strategy can improve the quality of an essay, its disadvantages are the additional time and effort that a student needs to implement it, including selecting and organizing the discourse modes. The writer first selects appropriate discourse modes and content. After choosing to employ, for example, argumentative and narrative discourse modes, the writer must select appropriate content for each mode that fit together. For example, the moral value of the cherry tree story should fit the argumentative claim that ‘honest people tend to be more successful’. Furthermore, the writer considers the macrostructure of the essay, regarding the proportions of the respective discourse modes (primarily argumentative, primarily narrative, or balanced) and where to place the content of each discourse mode: argument followed by narrative, narrative followed by argument, or interleaved. Next, the writer constructs suitable transition(s) between the two discourse modes to maintain the flow of the writing with cohesive devices such as connective words and bridging sentences (e.g. it’s like George Washington and the cherry tree).

To accomplish these additional tasks in MDM writing, writers need better writing skills and typically produce longer essays. Previous studies have shown that longer essays (with more words, H-2a, Kobrin et al. 2007; Crossley et al. 2015), and essays that used more cohesive devices (such as connective words) often received higher scores (H-2b, McNamara et al. 2010). Also, essays with higher syntactic complexity (longer sentences, H-2c) or lexical complexity (lower frequency words, H-2d, and higher lexical diversity, H-2e) often have higher scores (Crossley and McNamara 2010; Crossley et al. 2011; McNamara et al. 2013). Hence, we hypothesized that, (i) compared to single-discourse mode essays, MDM essays have more words, more cohesive devices, higher syntactic complexity, and greater lexical complexity, and (ii) these attributes mediate the link between MDM essays and higher essay scores (H-2a, b, c, d, e). Additionally, narrative discourses that recount simple, temporally ordered stories may include more concrete words (narrative particulars; e.g. ‘flowers, perfumes’ as the tokens of ‘gift’, Bruner 1991: 6). Also, essays by older (often advanced) writers often have more concrete words in their essays (lexical concreteness, H-2f, Crossley et al. 2011).

H-2a. More words mediate the link between the MDM strategy and higher essay scores.   
H-2b. Proportionally more connective words mediate the link between MDM strategy and higher essay scores.   
H-2c. Longer mean sentence length mediates the link between MDM strategy and higher essay scores.   
H-2d. Words that are less common (greater lexical complexity) mediate the link between MDM strategy and higher essay scores.   
H-2e. Proportionally greater measure of textual lexical diversity (MTLD) mediates the link between MDM strategy and higher essay scores.   
H-2f. Proportionally more concrete words mediate the link between MDM strategy and higher essay scores.

Participants in this study chose one of two essays with different prompts (picture or text, see Method) which could affect the essay score (Way et al. 2000; Yang et al. 2015; Shi et al. 2020). Tasks with higher reasoning demands might elicit more lexical and syntactic complexity to yield superior performance (H-3a, cognition hypothesis; Robinson 2001, 2003). As writers must decode spatial, casual, and intentional relations in picture-prompt tasks but not in textprompt tasks, the higher reasoning demands of the picture prompt may yield more complex writing (e.g. MDM strategies, more words, greater syntactic complexity, greater lexical complexity) and, therefore, better task performance (e.g. higher essay scores). Hence, we proposed hypotheses H-3a and b.

H-3a. Essays using the picture-prompt task receive higher scores than those for the text-prompt task.   
H-3b. The MDM strategy, the total number of words, and syntactic and lexical complexity mediate the link between prompts and essay scores.

# The present study

We found no published studies on MDM strategies in writing essays. Our study tested our three sets of hypotheses regarding whether an MDM strategy is related to linguistic complexity and essay scores in a high-stakes language exam.

# METHOD

# Data and tasks

The data for this study were drawn from previously completed, required examination essays by Grade 12 secondary students. The native Chinese students wrote Chinese language essays during the examination. We randomly sampled 695 anonymous essays with either a text $( n = 3 3 2$ ) or picture $n = 3 6 3$ ) argumentative essay prompt. The requirement for both essays was the same: choose one prompt and write a 650-word essay in 1.5 hours (Figure 2).

# Essay scores

Grade 12 students in Hong Kong write an essay during a Diploma of Secondary Education exam, and students use these scores on their applications to universities in Hong Kong. Our data consisted of the essays and official essay scores for 695 students. Scores were given by two experienced examination markers who independently assessed each essay on a 7-point rating scale (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, $5 ^ { * }$ , $5 ^ { * * }$ , ordered from lowest to highest) using a rubric with four dimensions: (i) content, (ii) expression, (iii) structure, and (iv) mechanics and handwriting. If two markers disagreed, a third marker scored the essay and the closest, highest pair of marks was used (Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority [HKEAA] 2019).

Figure 2: The text-prompted and picture-prompted writing topics in this study. Notes. The text-prompted task: write an essay entitled ‘Not to be the first and not to be the last either’ to express your opinion of this attitude toward lives. The picture-prompted task: write an essay entitled ‘The sun and the shadow’ according to the pictures.

# Coding of the MDM strategy

Operational definition. We defined an MDM strategy in an essay as including more than one discourse mode. For the scope of this paper, we only focus on the MDM strategy of employing both narrative and argumentation discourse modes. We coded an argumentative essay as an MDM essay if it has at least one occurrence of a narrative discourse mode that supported the writer’s argument by recounting an event or experience (Labov and Waletzky 2003). We did not code the quantity, proportion, or structures of narrative components.

Coding results. Two coders coded the essays by dividing them into MDM essays with both narrative and argument discourse modes, versus those with only an argument discourse mode. As anonymous government-employed raters scored the essays in an earlier year, we could not hire them to do additional coding. The first author of this paper coded all 695 essays and divided them into MDM essays with narrative components versus one-discourse mode essays using only argument discourse mode (with no narrative components). The second coder, a senior research assistant with a postgraduate degree in linguistics, coded half of the essays (173 text-prompt essays and 174 picture-prompt essays). For a small effect size of 0.2 and $\alpha = 0 . 0 5$ , a sample of 322 is sufficient to yield 95 per cent statistical power, so the second coder coded half of the essays (347) rather than all of them. They worked independently and coded the essays separately. As shown in Table 2, the two coders showed high inter-rater reliability (99 per cent agreement, Krippendorff’s (2012) $\alpha = 0 . 9 7 7$ ). Disagreements were resolved through discussion until they reached a consensus.

# Measures of linguistic complexity

We used the Chinese Coh-Metrix tool (Graesser et al. 2011; Lu et al. 2017) to measure the linguistic complexity of the essays, including the total number of words, syntactic and lexical complexity, and connectedness. Past studies showed that these measures were connected to essay quality (Crossley and McNamara 2010; Crossley et al. 2011; McNamara et al. 2013). See measures in Table 3.

# Data analysis

We ran hierarchical sets of regressions followed by a structural equation model to test whether MDM essays outperformed one-discourse mode essays, controlling for linguistic features. As the prompt type might affect the writing of the essay, we entered it first, before the essay measures. Then, we entered the top-down MDM strategy, followed by holistic features of essay discourse (‘Total number of words’ and $\%$ Connectives’). Next, we entered the syntactic variable (‘Mean sentence length’), followed by the smaller lexical complexity variables (‘Content word frequency’, ‘MTLD’, and ‘Word concreteness’). As omitting non-significant variables did not cause omitted variable bias, we safely removed them to increase precision and reduce multicollinearity (Kennedy 2008).

To test for multiple mediation effects simultaneously, we ran a structural equation model via Mplus 7.4 (Muthén and Muthén 1998–2015). To assess the goodness of fit, we used the comparative fit index (CFI), Tucker–Lewis index (TLI), root mean square error approximation (RMSEA), and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR), which minimize Type I and Type II errors under many simulation conditions (Hu and Bentler 1999). We used two-fit thresholds: good (CFI and $\mathrm { T L I } > 0 . 9 5$ ; $\mathrm { R M S E A } < 0 . 0 6$ ; $\operatorname { S R M R } < 0 . 0 8$ ) and moderate ( $0 . 9 0 < \mathrm { C F I }$ and $\mathrm { T L I } < 0 . 9 5 ; 0 . 0 6 < \mathrm { R M S E A } < 0 . 1 0 ; 0 . 0 8 < \mathrm { S R M R } < 0 . 1 0 $ ).

Notes. All measures were computed using the Traditional Chinese Coh-Metrix except for essay score, picture prompt, and the MDM strategy (http://cohmetrix.com/). a Mean sentence length was measured by a ratio of total words to sentences (Cai 2013). In Chinese, a word can be one, two, three, or even four characters long.

# RESULTS

# Descriptive statistics

Approximately half of the students chose the picture prompt (52 per cent, see Table 4). Among these essays, 77 per cent employed the multi-discourse (narrative and argument) modes. The mean essay score was 4.28 ( $S D = 2 . 5 4$ , range: 1–7). The mean essay length was 641 words ( $S D = 1 6 5$ ), close to the maximum of 650 words allowed.

# Explanatory model

All results discussed below describe the first entry into the regression, statistically controlling for all previously included variables. Ancillary regressions and statistical tests are available upon request.

Prompt, MDM strategy, total words, sentence length, and lexical complexity variables were related to essay score (see Table 5). Compared to text-prompt essays, picture-prompt essays had higher scores on average $b = 1 . 0 4 8$ ; range: 1–7; see Table 5, model 1), supporting hypothesis H-3a. MDM essays had higher scores than one-discourse mode essays on average $b = 2 . 2 5 3$ ; Table 5, model 2), supporting H-1 (see Table 6). Longer essays (more total words) often had higher scores ( $b = 0 . 0 0 8$ ; Table 5, model 3); an essay with 125 more words than another achieved on average a score one level higher $( 0 . 0 0 8 \times 1 2 5 = 1 )$ ), supporting H-2a. Essays with longer sentences than others showed lower scores ( $b$ $= - 0 . 1 9 6$ ; Table 5, model 4), contradicting H-2c.

Lexical complexity variables (content word frequency, word concreteness) were also related to essay score. Essays that used more common words (high-frequency words) had lower scores $\mathit { ^ { \prime } b = - 3 . 1 5 8 }$ ; Table 5, model 5), supporting H-2d. Essays with more concrete words (instead of abstract words) had higher scores $b = 1 . 1 6 5$ ; Table 5, model 3), supporting H-2f. Altogether, these explanatory variables accounted for 53 per cent of the variance in essay scores.

The structural equation model showed a moderate fit (see Figure 3; $\mathrm { C F I } = 0 . 9 6 7$ , $\mathrm { T L I } = 0 . 8 8 5$ , $\mathrm { R M S E A } = 0 . 0 8 7$ , $\operatorname { S R M R } = 0 . 0 4 5$ , $\chi ^ { 2 } [ 6 ] = 3 7 . 6 7$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ , $R ^ { 2 }$ for Essay score $= 0 . 4 9 1$ ). Total words and syntactic- and lexical-complexity variables also mediated the link between prompt and essay score. Students who chose the picture prompt more often wrote essays employing the MDM strategy $( + 0 . 1 5$ , supporting H-3b), fewer words $( - 0 . 1 1 )$ , shorter sentences $( - 0 . 1 0 )$ , infrequent words $( - 0 . 1 9 )$ , and more concrete words $( + 0 . 6 9 )$ . The total number of words and syntactic and lexical complexity also mediated the link between the MDM strategy and essay score, supporting H-2a and H-2d. Students who employed the MDM strategy wrote essays using more words $\left( + 0 . 3 6 \right)$ , shorter sentences $( - 0 . 1 1 )$ , infrequent words $( - 0 . 1 7 )$ , and more concrete words $\left( + 0 . 1 4 \right)$ . All other explanatory variables, interactions, and mediation tests were not significant. Notably, the percentage of connectives and MTLD were not significant.

# Discourse samples

Among these time-limited examination essays, those with longer sentences had lower scores, contradicting H-2c, so we examined several examples of longer versus shorter sentences (see translated Excerpts 1 and 2).

Excerpt 1. 若求平凡，因第一十分困難，如要做全球首富，可能你工作一生都 賺不到現時首富十分之一，那便放棄。(If peace is the desire, because being first is hard, if wanting to become the world’s richest person, maybe you could not earn ten percent of the wealth of the richest person after you work for your whole life, then to give it up).

Excerpt 2. 不做第一，最顯而易見的益處固然是避免自己風頭過盛，以致招 來禍患。(Not being first has the most obvious benefit of avoiding a high profile, which can otherwise cause a disaster.)

Excerpt 1 is a long sentence from a low-scoring essay. It has five segments separated by commas (a simpler paraphrase is ‘Few people can be first in their fields in society, so living a peaceful life isn’t a bad choice for an ordinary person’). Excerpt 2 is an example of a shorter sentence from a high-scoring essay. It contains fewer words than Excerpt 1, segmented into three sections (theme, benefit, and counter-consequence); it is more concise and easier to understand than the longer sentence. In these examination essays, weaker writers often wrote longer, incoherent sentences, while superior writers wrote concise, coherent ones.

# DISCUSSION

As no published study had examined how an MDM strategy affected essay scores, this was the first study to show that (i) essays written using such a strategy (i.e. combining argumentation and narrative) had higher essay scores and (ii) the total number of words and the lexical and syntactic complexity mediated the link between the MDM strategy and essay score.

# Direct and indirect effects of the MDM strategy on essay scores

Essays with an MDM strategy combining narrative and argument discourse modes had higher essay scores, which aligns with our theoretical model regarding the benefits of integrating multiple discourse modes. Our results are consistent with our claim that integrating narrative discourse with argumentation in an essay enables temporal and situational ‘particulars’ (narrative) to strengthen the argumentative reasoning, making it more memorable, comprehensible, emotionally sustainable, and persuasive (Labov and Waletzky 2003).

Furthermore, the MDM strategy has a direct effect on essay score, even after controlling for the total number of words and lexical and syntactic complexity. This direct effect suggests that the MDM strategy is a distinguishable, separate writing skill. Future studies can test whether writers develop MDM strategies at the later knowledge-crafting stage, in which they show greater awareness of the relations between the author, the text, and its readers (Kellogg 2008; Bereiter and Scardamalia 2013).

The total number of words, sentence length, word frequency, and concreteness mediated the positive link between the MDM strategy and essay score. Compared to one-discourse mode essays, the MDM essays often contained more words, which coheres with our hypothesis that MDM essays require more content. Infrequently used words (suggesting more difficult vocabulary) occurred more often in MDM essays than in one-discourse mode essays, which aligns with our hypothesis that greater writing skills (such as mastery of more complex vocabulary) are required to write MDM essays. Furthermore, shorter sentences and concrete words are suggestive of narrative effects (Bruner 1991). Sentences were shorter in the MDM essays (argument and narrative) than in one-discourse mode essays (argument only), which is consistent with the view that narrative essays typically contain simpler sentence structures and, therefore, shorter sentences. Additionally, concrete words occurred more often in the MDM essays than in one-discourse mode essays, which aligns with the view that narrative essays often describe concrete events and, therefore, use many concrete words. We present an example of the MDM strategy in Appendix A (Supplementary Material).

# Effects of linguistic complexity on essay scores

Linguistic complexity was also linked to essay scores. Essays with more words or more infrequent words had higher scores than other essays, cohering with the findings of previous studies (Crossley and McNamara 2010; Crossley et al. 2011; McNamara et al. 2013). In these time-limited examination essays, those with longer sentences had lower scores. Under time pressure, superior writers constructed concise, coherent sentences, while weaker writers constructed longer, incoherent ones. In untimed essays written outside of class, those with greater syntactic complexity achieved higher scores (McNamara et al. 2010). Possibly, writers who have sufficient time to plan/organize their ideas can construct better, longer sentences (Graham and Perin 2007; Graham and Sandmel 2011; Graham et al. 2015).

# Picture prompt and essay scores

Our results showed that the picture prompt was linked to MDM strategy, fewer words, shorter sentence length, more uncommon words, and more concrete words. These results are consistent with the view that different cognitive demands across tasks (e.g. prompts) can activate different prior knowledge to yield greater (or less) complexity in a student’s writing (Yang et al. 2015; Shi et al. 2020). They support Robinson’s (2001, 2003) cognition hypothesis: tasks with higher reasoning demands elicit more lexical and syntactic complexity to yield better performance. Hence, task designers and assessors can vary the cognitive demands of a task by using different task prompts in language assessment (Robinson 2001, 2003). Regardless of the task or prompt, examination essay is a special genre (‘timed-impromptu writing’, Perelman 2014) that differs from real-world language use, so essay performance might not generalize to other genre contexts (Bachman 2002).

# Implications for writing instructions and automated essay scoring

Although writing is critical to literacy and socioeconomic success in modern society (National Research Council 2006), writing is notoriously difficult to learn and teach (Bazerman et al. 2018). This study contributes a new construct to the relevant literature: an MDM writing strategy. Furthermore, this study shows that among these examination essays, those with multiple discourse modes had higher scores. As this MDM strategy capitalizes on the strengths of each discourse mode to achieve rhetoric purposes, teaching students to effectively use it might improve their writing; future intervention studies can test this idea and collect and analyse qualitative data regarding students’ MDM learning and use processes. For example, researchers can do ethnographies to identify students’ relevant social contexts (online or offline) and understand how they integrate them in their narratives and arguments in an MDM essay; such information can inform educators’ design of lessons about MDM strategies.

This study also has implications for writing assessment. The results show that six variables (prompt, the MDM strategy, total number of words, sentence length, content word frequency, and word concreteness) accounted for 53 per cent of the variance in essay scores, a substantial improvement over past models using only linguistic complexity and discourse cohesion indicators (whose explained variances ranged from 22 to 44 per cent; McNamara et al. 2010, 2013). If future studies show similar, superior results, then later automated essay scoring algorithms can use the MDM strategy to assess essays with greater accuracy. More generally, this study supports Deane’s (2011) call for further investigation of writers’ top-down conceptual strategies and sociocultural knowledge (e.g. schematic, pragmatic, register, and world knowledge). To further advance our understanding of writing and writing strategies, and the relevant instructions and assessment, future studies can examine literacy learning in school contexts and students’ language use in their daily life, especially on social media (social practice perspective).

# LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH

Our study has limitations concerning the scope of the MDM strategy, languages, student ages, and essay sampling. First, in this paper, we focus only on the combination of narrative and argument discourse modes in argumentative essays. Future studies can study MDM strategies involving more combinations of discourse modes. For example, such studies can study students’ (i) reports that combine report and description discourse modes or (ii) stories that combine narrative and description discourse modes (Smith 2003). As these tasks reflect students’ real-world language uses, they are particularly worth studying for pedagogical purposes. Second, we only analysed essays written in Chinese by native Chinese speakers; future studies can examine essays in other languages and those written by natives and/or second-language writers. Third, we only studied essays written by upper secondary school students; future studies can investigate essays written by students of different ages, which might illuminate age constraints concerning the use of MDM strategies. Researchers can also conduct qualitative studies on whether advanced writers tend to use more MDM strategies, and what interventions for teaching MDM strategies can succeed. Fourth, our essay sample only included two essay topics from a high-stakes examination; future studies can examine more topics and concerning different stakes (e.g. freewriting in a journal, class assignment, creative writing competition). Fifth, our data do not include students’ school lessons (such as whether teachers taught MDM strategies), textbooks, or home learning environment, so future studies can collect such data to test a richer explanatory model—for example, using controlled experiments to investigate whether short-term or long-term teaching of MDM strategies improves students’ essay writing or literacy development.
