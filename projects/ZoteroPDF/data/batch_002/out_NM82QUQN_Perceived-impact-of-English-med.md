This study explores the experiences and perceptions of transnational graduates from English medium instruction (EMI) programs at a Turkish higher education institution. A mixed-methods approach employing descriptive statistics and content analysis investigates how graduates perceive the impact of EMI on their content knowledge, English proficiency, career advancement, international exposure, and academic participation. Drawing on self-reported data, the study found that EMI programs contributed to professional development, facilitated career opportunities, and improved English language proficiency, particularly in technical vocabulary. Participants also reported feeling confident in their field-specific competencies and had better engagement with international communities and developments. Qualitative findings highlighted communication challenges experienced by transnational graduates when engaging with residents of their host communities. The study indicates the long-term outcomes of EMI programs for transnational graduates in today's interconnected and diverse professional landscape.

# 1. Introduction

Academic institutions are presently compelled to attract students and researchers from around the globe to foster a diverse and international academic community (Lasagabaster, 2022). Achieving this goal requires increasing inter-institutional mobility and nhancing the reutation of istitutions through prestigous education ranking systems. This proces i rearded as asteing stone to gain greater visibility on the global stage. The growing emphasis on intenationalisation in higher education institutions (HEIs) has led to the adoption of various srategies to attract and integrate transnational students. One prominent strategy is English medium instruction (EMI), an aproach where academic subjects are taught in English to diverse student populations, ofen coming from non-English speaking backgrounds (Macaro et al., 2018). EMI has provided the right raw material to promote internationalisation within HEIs.

The demand for EMI has surged due to several interrelated factors. Globalization within higher education and the need to equip students with internationall relevant skill are among the key drivers (Dearden, 2015). As a natural consequence of intenationali sation efforts, proponents of EMI also argue that the Englishization of higher education facilitates student and faculty mobilit across borders by bridging communication gaps. As Van Parijs (2021) points out, universities are increasingly pressured to compete in a global market for students and talent. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that the intenationalisation of higher education is not without complexitie. Universities are increasingly operating in a competitive global market, vying for students who bring in revenue and prestige. The increasing focus on international student recruitment potentiall leads to a market-driven approach within universities, potentially prioritizing financial gain over academic excellence. In this scenario, EMI becomes a strategic tool.

Many countries now recognize the value of EMI and prioritize its implementation within their higher education systems. Intriguingly, EMI programs have even managed to take rot in countries where foreign language teaching has traditionally ben carce or non-existent (Lasagabaster, 2022). These include nations as diverse and geographicall disparate as China, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Spain. This is atestament to the global appeal of this nnovative approach to delivering content. The trend towards EMI is also evident in Turkiye, where the current study took place.

The literature often relies on broad definitions of international students' that overlook the complexities of their identities and experiences (Bennettet al., 2023). Recognizing the need for a more precise understanding of the study group, this study is specifically concerned with transnational students. The term transnational' i often described as internationalisation abroad, and emphasizes the movement across national borders for the purpose of completing afull degree program, rather than short-term mobility (Knight, 2004). This distinction is important because transnational student, compared to international students engaged in briefer exchange programs, may face unique challenges and opportunities as they integrate into the professional world of their host country.

Transnational education has been on the rise in recent years, driven by globalization and the increasing emphasis on cros-cultural exchange and intenational collaboration. EMI plays a significant role in this educational paradigm, especiall for students aiming to integrate into global work environments. While studies like Huang & Curle's (2021) contribute valuable insights by exploring Chinese students' and graduates' perceptions of EMI's impact on career prospects in a specific program in China, the current study spefialy targets transnational graduates across various EMI programs. To the best of the authors knowledge, the literature has not extensively reported on the long-term impact of EMI on transnational students following graduation. This highlights two significant research gaps: the lack of focus on transnational graduates, and the long-term effects of EMI on their professional lies. Therefore, this study in. vestigates the perceived impacts of EMI programs on transnational graduates, focusing on how EMI has influenced their English proficiency, international exposure, carer advancement, and content knowledge. The study employs a mixed-methods approach, utilizing surveys with 68 participants and interviews with four volunteer participants to explore potential overlaps or discrepancies between exsting literature and the perceptions of the transnational graduates of a universty in Turkiye. To do this, we continue with a review of perception-based and empirical studies conducted in various countrie to recollect what has been covered regarding EMI programs.

# 2. Literature review

The growing recognition of EMI has sparked a surge of interest in academic circles. The literature abounds with studies investigating the perceptions and challenges of students who are currntly undergoing EMI programs. A recently published volume edited by Griffiths (2023) presents a collection of related data from 11 prespecified zones around the world (South Africa, Turkiye, Egypt, Greece, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Brazil, Poland, Japan, India, Norway), alongside a thorough literature review for each zone. The last chapter of the book by Kok (2023) merges each accumulation of data to find that the perceptions and challenges of students and lecturers are fairly consistent all over the world. These commonly mentioned benefits include bettr job prospects, improved English proficiency, and easier aces to English resources, while low language proficiency is primarily at the core of the challenges faced by lecturers and students.

# 2.1. Student perceptions and expectations from EMI

The growing body of research on EMI student perceptions reveals a consistent theme: students view EMI programs favourably as a potential gateway to diverse career opportunities. These opportunities may include easier job placement, higher salaries, or stronger promotion prospects (Alazemi, 2020; Derakhshan et al., 202; Ekoc, 2020; Huang & Curle, 2021; Thomas et al., 2016), or may serve as a pathway to emigration to prosperous countries (Hajar e al., 2023; Orr & Annous, 2018; Zakharia, 2010). For example, Huang and Curle (2021) examined the perspectives of universty students regarding the potential impact of EMI on their career advancement. The study gathered both quantitative and qualitative data from current and graduate students enrolled in an EI Finance rogram. Unlike the current study on transnational students, Huang and Curl included data collection from Chinese EMI graduates. The findings indicated that the expectations of the current students and the experiences of the alumni students matched in terms of the positive effect of EMI on thir career prospects. They believed that EMI could/did broaden their career options and create more ob oppor. tunities by enhancing their proficiency in English.

Another prevalent expectation is that students' proficiency in English wil significantly improve upon participation in these pro grams. The positive impact of EMI programs on English language skill, particularly in academic and technical areas, has bn well established through numerous studies (Cosgun & Hasrci, 2017; Krkgoz et al., 2023; Linn & Radjabzade, 2021). Cosgun and Hasirc) (2017) as well as Yuksel et al. (2021) reported notable improvements in language skills among undergraduates enrolled in EMI programs. More specificall, Al-Bakri (2013) found that undergraduates expressed their beliefs in the critical importance of English especially within their chosen field f tudy. Their tance was mainly grounded in practical and realistc onsiderations. Those studying Information Technology (IT) specfically sserted that English is the most suitale instructional anguage due to its ability to convey terminological and technical information efectively. There are, however, several other studies that have reported minimal or no improvements in language proficiency as a result of EMI programs (Kim et al., 2017; Sahan & Sahan, 2021), which makes i difficult to reach a clear-cut judgment about the effects of EMI on language proficiency.

As for international exposure and academic participation, students are also drawn to EMI programs to develop effective communication skills within international business collaborations, academic communities, and conferences (Krkgoz et al., 2023) Considering that a great number of studies are published in English, students are atracted to studying their major in English. It is assumed that graduation from such programs willprovide them with accesto a wider range of academic resources and research materials (Bukve, 2018).

# 2.2. EMI and content knowledge

The impact of EMI on content knowledge has received less atention in the literature (Tong et al., 2020). The effect of EMI on content lening in higher education remains unclear due to a lack f conclusive empirical studies. Some studie report negative effects of EMI on content learning (Hellekjaer, 2010; Li, 2018), while others indicate positive or non-significant ffects (Aizawa et al, 2023; Dafouz & Camacho-Minano, 2016; Dafouz et al., 2014; Lin & Lei, 2021). The most recent study, Aizawa et al. (2023), considered undergraduates' prior knowledge and found no significant ifference in how EMI and non-EMI groups progressed in their under. standing of Chemistry. This suggests that content larning through EMI did not have a negative impact on content learning, although their qualitative findings revealed language-related challenges for students with lower English proficiency. This implies that EMI may pose challenges for students content learning based on their English proficiency and may require them to exert more ffort to keep pace with more proficient peers.

The study by Li (2018), for example, explored the impact of a bilingual program provided to students majoring in social science at a Chinese universty. While it was found that the bilingual program improved students' English language skill, the primary goal of nhancing students understanding of subject matter was not realize. One major obstacle identified in affcting student success n the bilingual program was an inadequate level of English proficiency. Insufficient competence in English hindered students from comprehending essential instructions delivered in English, consequently impacting their acquisition of content knowledge. It i, inded, constantly echoed in the review that students who receive education in EMI often encounter language challenges and their limited proficiency in English can negatively affct their understanding of lectures, and may result in instructors simplifying the content, which ultimately affects their mastery of the subject matter (Lin & Lei, 2021).

Table 1 below summarizes the study groups and contexts of the research cited thus far. Notably, the studies overwhelmingly focus on undergraduate students, with only one including graduate students. There is a complete ack of research on transnational graduaes:

# 2.3. Lecturer perspectives

An important part of the research focus in EMI is also based on the perceptions and perspectives of lecturers involved in these programs (Belhiah & Elhami, 2015; Ozer, 2020; Turhan & Kirkgoz, 2018). EMI programs were generally welcomed by lecturers as a means of providing easier accessto English resources and familiarity with field-specific technical terms. Moreover, there is a general belief that more job opportunities wil be offered to students who graduate from EMI programs and more opportunitie for salary promotion for the lecturers. As for the organizational misson, the lecturers in the study of Gavrilidou and Mitits (2023) reported perceived benefits for the internationalisation of their institutions through access to a broader range of transnational students. However, as in many studies examining student perceptions, lecturers also note that the lessons are one-sided and non-interactive, and the main dificult i transferring content is due to the lack f foreign language proficiency of the stakeholders, which is mentioned in

almost every EMI study as an obstacle to the successful implementation of the programs (Guarda & Helm, 2017; Henriksen et al., 2018;   
Macaro et al., 2018).

# 3. Focus of the study and research questions

While the literature provides valuable insights into various aspects of EMI programs, there are stil ares for further investigation. After a thorough scanning of the literature, it remains unclear what impacts EMI could have on transnational graduates. Therefore. further exploration is required to unvel the complexities surrounding this ssue and obtain more insights into its implications for transnational students' growth and development in the long run. Given that EMI is mostly recognized as a practice to attract transnational students and boost the international status of the institutions (Dearden, 2015; Rose et al., 2020), one such area of potential exploration is, therefore, the perceptions and experiences of transnational students afer they graduate from EMI programs in higher education. The currnt study willfocus on exploring how their EMI experiences have enabled them to navigate their careers and how they perceive the impact of these experiences on their professional development in today's globalized world. It will ontribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the long-term effcts of EMI programs on transnational graduates. The experience of the target group are particularly relevant in today's world, where globalization has led to a growing number of transnational students pursuing higher education outside their home countries.

Based on the review above, the following research questions were formulated to guide the study:

1. How do transnational graduates perceive the effctivenessof EMI in enhancing their content knowledge and job-specificskils in   
their chosen field?   
2. How do they assess the impact of EMI on their ability to use English effectively in their professional lives?   
3. How do they experience the impact of EMI on their job prospects and career advancement opportunities?   
4. How do they view the impact of EMI on their international exposure and academic participation?

# 4. Method

# 4.1. Research design

The present study adopted a mixed-methods research to methodically investigate the perceptions and experiences of EMI graduates from a 50-year-old state university in south-east Turkiye with about 50,o0 students. The use of a structured questionnaire as the data collection tol aligns with established quantitative research practices and captures participants' perceptions, providing preliminary insights into their post-EMI experiences (Mellinger & Hanson, 2021). Semi-structured interviews are used to cross-check the quantitative data and investigate the points that require further exploration (Creswell, 2014).

# 4.2. Context and participants

Turkish universities are regulated by the Council of Higher Education (YOK in Turkish), the primary governing body overseeng all higher education institutions in the country. According to Y0K's most recent university datalist published in 2023, 3201 out of 11863 undergraduate programs, excluding 2-year vocational programs, are offred through EMI in Turkish higher education (OsYM, 2023). This is a significant number, and reflects the growing emphasis on internationalisation within Turkish universities.

The current institution has been at the forefront of offering EMI programs, attracting a diverse student body. Recognizing the importance of English in a globalized world, the universty has become a preferred choice for approximately 7o00 transnational students thanks to its variety of EMI programs spanning several disciplines, including enginering, social sciences, natural sciences, humanities, medicine, and business This reflects the university's global appeal and the increasing internationalisation of higher education (Machleid et al., 2020).

To ensure that students are adequately prepared for these EMI programs, the university offers an Intensive English Program (IEP) with an annual capacity of approximately 1600 students. This rogram is designed to improve the English language skils of incoming students, particularly those who may require aditional preparation for the academic demands of EMI programs. The IEP focuses on developing reading, writing, speaking, and listening competencies, serving as a bridge to ensure students are linguistically and academically prepared to thrive in their chosen EMI program.

The study was conducted under the control and approval of the School of Foreign Languages of the university as part of a graduate satisfaction program. A purposive sampling strategy was employed to ensure a well-represented range of academic disciplines (en. gineering, social sciences, natural sciences, humanities, and business) and graduation years (2015-2023) among the participants. All the transnational graduates $\left( \mathrm { N } = 7 8 7 \right)$ in the database were individually emailed to complete the survey $( \mathrm { N } = 6 8 )$ and participate in the interview $( \Nu = 4 )$ voluntarily. The participants were transnational graduates who had completed their undergraduate or graduate degrees entirely through EMI programs at the university. This ensured they had firs-hand experience and insights into the long-term effects of EMI on their careers. Their graduation timelines were varied, with some being recent alumni and others having graduated a few years previously. None of the participants, including the Americans, Canadians, South Africans, and Hongkongers, have English as their first language. Thirt-seven of the graduates had also graduated from a schoo that adopted EMI, meaning more than half of the graduates had an EMI background prior t their higher education. The demographics of the participants along with their frequency and percentages are presented in Table 2:

# 4.3. Data collection instruments

# 4.3.1. Survey

The quantitative data for this study was colected through a researcher-designed survey that explored the self-reported perceptions of transnational graduates from the university's EMI programs. The survey instrument was developed based on a review of relevant literature to ensure alignment with the study's objectives (Fernandez-Costales, 2017; Tanjung et al., 2021). To ensure the survey's clarity, eectivenes, and valiit, a multi-stage develoment process was employed. Following an intial draft based on the literaure review, a pilot test was conducted with two EMI graduates. Their feedack informed revisions to the survey items, ensuring better clarity and a smoother question flow (Berger et al., 2018). Finally, the survey was presented to a PhD expert specializing in EMI education and reearch methodologies. Their fedback further strengthened the survey's validity and reliability (Kimafar et al., 2016). Moreover, the instrument demonstrated high internal consistency reliability with Cronbach's Alpha () of 0.988 (number of items $=$ 36). This indicates a strong level of homogeneity among the items, suggesting they all measure the same underlying construct effectively. The survey employed a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from \*Strongly Disagree" (1) to \*Strongly Agree" (5), allowing participants to express the degree to which they agreed or disagreed with each statement related to their EMI experience.

The survey was divided into two main parts. The first section collcted demographic data about the participants, including their gender, nationalit, academic and educational backgrounds. The second section focused on the core aspects of the EMI experience through a series of 36 perception items. The items were delivered in English and categorized into four thematic areas. The decision to categorize the items was rooted in the literature, where similar themes have been identified ascrucial in understanding the impact and implications of EMI. Therefore, such categorization was necessry in order to provide a structured framework for the survey, ensuring that a wide array of facets related to EMI education was covered (Despitasari, 2021). A breakdown of these categories is provided below:

Content Knowledge (6 items): This group of items asessed participants' perceptions of their ability to understand and apply fieldspecific knowledge gained through EMI programs.   
Language Proficiency (12 items): This group of items examined participants self-reported confidence and competence in using English for academic and professional tasks.   
Career Advancement and Opportunities (7 items): This group of items investigated participants' views on how EMI programs influenced their job prospects, career advancement, and competitiveness in the global job market.   
International Exposure & Academic Participation (10 items): This group of items explored participants' perceptions of how EMI programs facilitated access to international resources, research opportunities, and professional networks.

# 4.3.2. Semi-structured interviews

Four of the survey participants volunteered to take part in the semi-structured interviews with nine predetermined inquiries that targeted the same areas as the survey (see Appendix for the interview questions). These questions were developed by the researchers and tested with a group of instructors to reduce potential ambiguities. Additional questions were also addressed depending on the progression of the interviews. The interviews provided an opportunity for participants to elaborate on their survey responses, share personal experience, and provide insights into their perceptions of EMI education. To ensure participant confidentiality, pseudonyms were assigned to the interview participants. To provide further context to the interview findings, brief profiles of the four volunteers are as follows: (1) Ahmad currently works as a doctor in the department of vascular and thoracic surgery at a major hospital in central Germany. Their current job titlei Assistant Physician. (2) Kamal currently works as an Education Program Manager at Chemonics International, a prominent company in the international development sector. Their focus are is within the education sector. (3) Tariq currently works at a management consultancy firm in Dubai. Their focus area is software development and IT. (4) Shama is asciated with Makerere University in Uganda, engaging in teaching and research activities. They contribute to the academic growth and development of students and the broader academic community.

# 4.4. Data collection procedure and analysis

The survey questionnaire was distributed electronically via an online survey platform. Participants received an email invitation containing a link to the questionnaire with clear instructions on completion. Responses were collected anonymously, and the participants were guaranteed confidentiality and were notified of their right to exit the study at any time. Adequate time was provided for completion, with reminders sent to maximize response rates. Participants inteested in interviews were contacted via email. The videoconferenced interviews were recorded with consent and transcribed verbatim for analysis.

Quantitative survey data were analysed using descriptive statistics (frequencies, percentages, mean scores). Qualitative interview data were analysed using thematic analysis, with transcripts coded to identify recurring themes and patterns.Finall, data from both quantitative and qualitative strands were integrated to provide a comprehensive understanding of transnational graduates' post-EMI experiences.

# 5. Findings and discussion

This section explores the experiences of transnational graduates from an EMI program, focusing on the program's impact on ther content knowledge, language proficiency, carer prospects, and intenational exposure. The findings are presented alongside relevant literature to provide a comprehensive understanding of EMI's effctiveness The qualitative data from four EMI graduates provide further insights and explanations for the quantitative indings. A discusion of the implications f these findings i presented at the end of each theme.

# 5.1. Content knowledge

A significant number of transnational graduates associate EMI education with attaining better content knowledge and job-specific skills alongside a strong grasp of field-specific concepts in English (Table 3). The quantitative data from the survey supports this association, with mean scores exceeding 3.7 on a 5-point scale for all items related to content knowledge (items 1, 3, and 4). Specifically, graduates reported feeling they have better content knowledge $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 9 0 ) $ , a better understanding of concepts in their field $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 8 8 )$ I, and a better grasp of field-specific terminology in English compared to their first language $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 7 6 )$ . Additionally, a greater number of participants reported feeling confident in their professions $\mathbf { \left( M = 3 . 9 3 \right. }$ ) and having a better command of how things work in their workplaces $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 6 5 )$ . These findings suggest a positive impact of EMI on content knowledge and job-related skills.

As for the qualitative data, three participants pecifically mentioned that as a result of EMI, they feel more confident in using their field-related technical vocabulary. The findings support the general assumption oftchnical vocabulary gain as aresult of EMI. This is further illustrated by a participant in the study:

In Germany, I sillook up stuf in medicine in English. EMI really helped me a lot in terms of technical and profesional vo. cabulary. It did have a positive efect because we had to look up content and sources in English at school and this way you come in contact with a different vocabulary. That extends your 'word pool' (Ahmad, interview).

In addition to emphasising the benefits for technical vocabulary acquisition, Ahmad further elaborated by comparing his competence with his Turkish colleagues. Having accessto English resources and using English for coursework probably expanded his vocabulary beyond what would have ben possible studying solely in Turkish. This broader vocabulary proved advantageous when working alongside colleagues who had not studied medicine in English:

I know that because when we joined in a program in the hospital with our Turkish colleagues, we would mention some terms, which were foreign to them and they hadn't heard or they only knew the Turkish words for them because they studied medicine in Turkish (Ahmad, interview).

A comparion between what has been covered in the recent literature and our findings was made to crosscheck if there was a match between the repeated perceptions and the actual experiences of the transnational students in ths study afer their graduation. RQ1 addressed the question of whether EMI has an impact on students content knowledge and job-related sils, and whether EMI yields better outcomes in terms f field information. This has been a matter of debate. Although several studies from different contexts produced conradctory reults Aizawa et al., 2023; Dafouz et l., 2014; Hellekjaer, 2010; i, 2018; Lin & Lei, 2021), the findings f the current study showed highly positive erctions relatd to bettr content knowledge and job-specific skils intransnational graduates respective felds thanks to EMI. Kamal's experience exemplifies this point: I work on educational projects to provide education for students in Northwest Syria, and my studies in EMI enhanced my knowledge a lot about how to conduct research methodologies and assessment' (Kamal, interview).

# 5.2. Language proficiency

The survey results (Table 4) indicate a positive perceived impact of EMI programs on the language proficiency of transnational graduates, especially in terms of field-specific technical and professional vocabulary $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 8 1 $ ). Over half of the participants reported feeling confident in their English language kills, with a total mean score of 3.94. This is further supported by the finding that nearly three-quarters of the participants felt comfortable with work-related correspondence $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 9 4 ) .$ ) and discussions $( \mathrm { M } = 4 . 4 4 )$ in English.

However, the data also suggest some areas for potential improvement. The number of undecided students was relatively higher for items related to speaking and presentation skill (items 11 and 12), although mean scores for these items were sill positie (3.93 and 3.85 respectively). This highlights the potential need for EMI programs to focus more on developing spoken communication and presentation skill in English, ensuring graduates feel confident not only in understanding and using work-related vocabulary but also effectively communicating complex ideas in professional settings.

An extract from the interviews elaborates on Ahmad's comfort with using English terminology in their profession, even f i is not their first language. They emphasized that their EMI education has equipped them with the necessary technical vocabulary to communicate and discus their fied-specific concets and ideas in English confidenly, wheeas it is ifficult for them to do so in their first language:

Sometimes my parents ask me about the operations I do and I can't really explain them in Arabic. Of course, I can broadly explain them but I don't know the corresponding terms. Professionall, Ican do it far more comfortably in English (Ahmad, interview).

Kamal also mentions that some terms or concepts in English do not have direct translations in their first language or are not widely used. Consequently, they feel more comfortable using English teminology, particularly in professiona ettings where recise language is essential for effective communication. "Sometimes, you know, we have some terminology in the English language that we dont have or we don't use in our first language. So, I feel comfortable using the English one".

Attaining a general English proficiency by the end of EMI programs is considered a prior expectation from such programs, which is evidenced by the quantitative data. However, the qualitative data suggest otherwise. Leaving the work-related vocabulary gains aside, the participants donot believe that E had either ngative or ositie effct on their geral English kills It remains evident that having a grounded proficiency is necessary to benefit ully from M programs, as Ahmad sted, stuying in Englishi one thing, and practicing and learning a language is another. Therefre, it i more important for students to be fluent and flexible with the language in order to study effectively". The following excerpt serves as a reminder that simply studying in an EMI program willnot magically lead to attaining good proficiency:

If you barely know the language and hope that studying in English will change it, you are going to face a lot of diffculties. Another thing, a lot of my friends were passing their courses because they could read and understand all the English questions but their speaking and communication skills didn't really improve (Tariq, interview).

The participants also compared the EMI experiences of their transnational friends who had graduated from the same department but were still unable to communicate in English even ater their graduation. This finding suggests that educational and language background along with personal experiences play a larger role than EMI programs in building language proficiency, as elaborated in the following excerpt:

I wouldn't say an EMI program would make anyone fluent in English if they dont work on themselves personall. It helps open a new door but it is not enough. I have friends that graduated from the same department and they still cannot have proper conversations in English (Kamal, interview).

Attaining proficiency in English is often assciated with EMI programs, either as a source of motivation to gravitate towards EMI or as an expected outcome after graduation (Sahan & Sahan, 2024), although several other studies have found slight or no language gains from EMI programs (Kim et al, 2017; Sahan & Sahan, 2021). The literature review on this matter highlighted divergent findings, as did the quantitative and qualitative findings of the current study.

RQ2 inquired about the perceived impact of EMI on the language proficiency of transnational graduates and their ability to communicate efectively in English after graduation. Firstly, the literature reports a general tendency among stakeholders to believe that students' English proficiency will significantly improve through participation in EMI programs (Borg, 2016; Cosgun & Hasirc1, 2017; Lin & Radjabzade, 2021). Likewise, the results of the current study indicate that the majorit of participants rported a higher level of English proficiency, particularly in field-specific, work-related, technical, and professional vocabulary. They reported a better understanding of field-specific terminologies in English, which suggests that EMI programs can contrbute to the acquisition of ter. minologie that are esential for success i specifi fields (Borg, 2016). Additionall, the undergraduates in Al-Bakri (2013) believed that English is esential for efectively conveying technical information, epecially in specifi fils such as . What is evident, based on the current findings and the literature review, is that EMI programs can highly contribute to the professional and technical vocabulary of transnational graduates.

# 5.3. Career Advancement and Opportunities

EMI programs are often lauded for their perceived benefits in career advancement. Table 5 provides detailed insights into the professional experiences of transnational graduates. While a majority (over $5 0 \%$ ) reported feeling able to find a good job after graduation $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 6 6 )$ , a significant proportion $( 2 2 \% )$ remained undecided on this issue. This suggests that factors beyond an EMI degree may influence ob search outcomes. The quantitative data fers mixed support for the asociation between EMI and higher earnings or promotions. Mean scores for items related to earning more than peers (3.37) and receiving promotions (3.32) were lower than those observed in previous sections. While the majority of participants reported feeing ready and confident to work in aglobal business environment $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 8 4 )$ , they expressed greater uncertainty regarding career opportunities within Turkiye $\mathbf { \ N } = 3 . 1 6$ ) and higher salaries $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 3 7 )$

Based on the literature review, one of the perceived benefits of EMI is that programs can have a positive impact on career advancements and opportunities for graduates. Several studies support the positive perception of EMI programs regarding career advancements. For example, Alazemi (2020), Derakhshan et al. (202), Eko (2020), and Thomas et al. (2016) all highlight the potential of EMI programs to enhance job prospects, salary, and promotion opportunities. These studies indicate that EMI graduates are perceived as having an advantage in the job market, especially in international or global contexts. The findings of the current study suggest that EMI programs may equip graduates with the necessary English language sills and global perspective to navigate in. ternational job markets. However, additional factors such as specific job skills industry experience, and geographical location may

also play a significant role in career advancement outcomes.

The interviews underscore the positie career implications of EMI for transnational graduates. Ahmad, Kamal, and Shama reported that their EMI background not only enhanced their employability but also eased their transtion into beter roles in the workplace. This aspect is particularl evident in the narrative of Shama. They attributed their acquisition of a researcher position in part to their EMbased education. I work as a researcher i the institute now, they stated, I believe my bachelor's degree in English helped me to get this position' (Shama, interview). Two other participants also reported that being an EMI graduate has directly or indirectly made a difference in their career, especially when applying for a job. As Ahmad stated:

It shows the employers that you have good language skill. Thats kind of a wanted quality in a doctor. Medicine isalready hard enough, if you say you studied it in English, that definitely leaves the impresson that you are a hardworking person. It also helps you stand out among other applicants ... (Ahmad, interview).

Tariq, however, seemed indecisive about the career benefits of being an EMI graduate. They pointed out that having only an EMI degree would not be suficient to secure a job position. They (employers) don't relly care about your diploma unlessyou are a new graduate, what really matters is that you have a diploma, anguage skill, and your experience, all combined" Nevertheless, they argued that \*when people hear you graduated from an English department, they react positively" (Tariq, interview).

The most rlatable study to the current one is the study by Huang and Curle (2021), which compared the data of current and graduate students to find that both groups had positive perceptions of the impact of EMI on their career prospects. The quantitative and qualitative findings mostly align with the findings of Huang and Curle (2021). Although a quarter of participants remained undecided or disagreed, the majority reported being able to find good employment as a result of their EMI education $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 6 6 )$ . The items about readiness to work in the global market, understandably enough, scored the highest $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 8 4 ) .$

# 5.4. International exposure and academic participation

The final sub-section explores how EMI graduates interact with international communities, engage with global developments, and participate in academia. The findings in Table 6 largely support the positive impact of EMI in this area. The majorit of participants reported feeing they have better access to field-related resources, developments, news, publications, and research (mean score exceeding 3.8 for items 26, 27, 28). This sugests that EMI programs equip graduates with the English language kills necessary to stay current with advancements in their chosen fields.

Furthermore, graduates reported feeling confident in research and development activities conducted in English $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 8 5 )$ and being able to contribute to international projects at their workplaces $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 3 . 9 0 )$ . These findings, coupled with the high mean score for having a better global perspective' (3.99), sugest that EMI programs may foster valuable skills and knowledge for navigating international professional environments.

However, the data also reveals a noteworthy finding regarding social participation. While most participants flt that studying in the medium of English gave them a more respected image and perception as more educated' (mean scores exceeding 3.9 for items 33 and 34), the final item concerning interaction with people in the host country yielded the highest number of undecided $( 2 1 \% )$ and negative responses $( 1 8 \% )$ . This suggests that while EMI may enhance acess to international networks, it may not necessarily guarantee seamless social integration within the host country. The overall mean score for this section (3.86) remains positive, but the findings reveal both the benefits of EMI for professional engagement on a global scale and the potential limitations regarding social integration within the host country.

All the interviewees agreed that 'knowing English in this globalized world is a necessity no matter where you are." Ahmad highlighted that \*even in Germany, one always has to look up new information in medicine in English'. Additionall, it was noted that accesing resources in English is considered a quick way to obtain information as i allows direct access t feld-related resources, developments, news, publications, and research. Tariq referred to this \*as the main and most prominent advantage of being an EMI graduate". The following excerpt by Ahmad illustrates this advantage clearly:

.. There is a new kind of operation that we need to do. A lot of my German colleagues here atended only the German version and they leaned how to do it. got t attend the German-only conference and I got to attend a conference in Belgium, which was held in English and, another one in Canada. And you get to experience how an operation is done diffrently in different countries (Ahmad, interview).

Shama highlighted another critical advantage of their EMI education as the ease of conducting and reporting research in English. They explained that their extensive exposure to English during academic trining improved both their language sils and acquainted them with the conventions of academic discourse in English. This serves as an asst in the global research community, where English predominates in publications, conferences, and collaborative projects. Furthermore, as an education program manager in a nongovernmental organization, Kamal emphasized that \*studying the field of education in English has enabled me to identify with the research questions in our projects and collaborate effectively with foreign researchers." Kamal also added that \*it is easier to find scholarships or programs that can support projects if you communicate with them in English'.

The interviewees unanimously agreed with the quantitative finding that studying in English is prestigious and respected, as illustrate by Kamal: Tm surrounded by international people, Turks, Syrians, and Americans. When you are educated in specifi fields in English, people recognize you better, especially when you are aware of technical ssues." s another finding suggests, transnational students a build an eanding cire of friens thanks toI pograms. This s specified in the following excrt \*Scilly, Iaso got to meet a lot of international friends at university. Actuall, my close friends were mostly Asian and Malaysians, so being a foreign student in a different country kind of expanded my circle of friends" (Ahmad, interview).

EMI programs are believed to provide students with access to up-to-date resources, international work-related news, and inter. national publications in their field (Krkgoz et al., 2023). Beides, this exposure to intenational resources is believed to enhance their understanding of global developments and alows them to stay informed about advancements in ther feld. As part of RQ4, the current study explored the extent of international exposure and academic participation of transnational graduates. The majority of the participants reported having better acces to up-to-date resources, iternational work-related news, and intenational publications intheir field. They also felt confident in research and development activitie in English and believed that their EMI education provided them with a global perspective in their professon. Furthermore, many participants felt that their EMI background enhanced their image, making them more respected and regarded as more educated by those around them, as evidenced by the qualitative datas wel.

The findings regarding communication with people within the host country in English, however, received more negative responses, indicating that there may be challenges in using English for ocial interactions with residents of their host communitie. This problem is especially evident in the experiences of Shama and Ahmad from the faculty of medicine. They reported that they had encountered challenges in practical setigs, particularly when interacting with fficials and patients. Most of my patients were Turkish and did not know English, the former recounted, highlighting a critical gap in communication. Shama's proficiency in medical English and their "street Turkish did not translate into effective patient communication due to the language barrier. They further stated, I could not speak Turkish and medicine was fully in English, I had difficulty communicating with hospitalofficials and patients" (Shama, interview).

The Syrian graduate, who has been working in Germany for 5 years as a doctor, points out the problem in the following extract.

You can teach the theoretical and technical parts of Medicine in English, that wasn't a problem in the first three years, the problem was when we moved to the hospital for the practical part as of the fourth year, it was ${ } ^ { 1 8 0 ^ { \circ } }$ different from what we had because, all of a sudden, you are supposed to speak fluent Turkish because you have to work with nurses and patients, and it all goes in Turkish (Ahmad, interview).

This finding suggests that while EMI programs facilitate academic success and global connectivity, they may simultaneously impede the full sociocultural integration of transnational students into the host country. This dichotomy poses a significant challenge for program administrators and policymakers, who must balance the benefit of English proficiency with the need for cultural and linguistic immersion in the host country's environment especially as graduates of medicine. A further sugestion could be made for the inclusion of home-country language courses in EMI programs in order to improve job prospects and social immerson of transnational students in the host country pre- and post-graduation.

# 6. Conclusion

The overall EM1 literature identifies several key areas of potential positive impact for transnational graduates: improved language proficiency, enhanced career opportunities, and increased international exposure. Additionally, the influence of EMI on content knowledge remains a topic of ongoing research. On the whole, this four-sided categorization provided aframe of reference for this study, which explored the post-EMI experiences of transnational EMI graduates acrostese domains. The overall positive impact of EMI on the respective categories was especially found to be evident in the current study. The findings have several implications for higher education institutions that offr EMI programs. Firstly, the qualitative data and the abundance of literature highlight the importance of language proficiency in achieving better content knowledge and professional kill in EMI programs. To ensure student success in EMI programs, universties should proactively adress anguage proficiency. This could involve implementing preparatory programs, concurrent language support, or bilingual/multilingual models (Richards & Pun, 2023).

The findings principally confirm existing assumptions concerning transnational students. This is not to say that similar results will be collected from every other context, but according to the results of this study, EMI programs have the potential to provide transnational students with better feld-specific knowledge, professinal vocaulary, career opportunities, intenational exposure, and academic participation. One significant challenge that emerged, however, is the issue of sociocultural integration in the host country for transnational graduates of EMI programs which requires interaction with residents. Including language courses from the host country in the curriculum may help facilitate integration by equipping students with the essential language skills and cultural knowledge to communicate and interact with residents of their host communities effectively.

This study contributes to the understanding of EMI programs impact on transnational graduates' academic and professonal experiences. However, further research can offr even richer insights. Our dataset holds potential for additional statistical analyses to explore how factors like year of graduation, field of study, and prior English language proficiency might nfluence these experiences. Expanding the scope of interviews with more transnational graduates could also provide a deeper understanding of the long-term effects of EMI programs.

While the mixed-methods approach strengthens this study's overall credibility, some limitations warrant consideration. Self reported data may be susceptible to social desirability bias, meaning participants might unintentionally provide answers they believe are more socially acceptable. dditionally, the relatively short timeframe since graduation for some participants may limit our ability to fully understand the long-term efects of EMI programs. Longitudinal studies tracking graduates over time could provide valuable insights into how EMI programs influence professional trajectories.

Studies exploring the sociocultural integration of transnational graduates and strategies to facilitate this process are needed. Understanding the challnges and opportunities related to integration can help universties develop programs that beter support transnational students beyond academic achievement. This might include incorporating the host country'sfirst language to enhance job prospects and communicatio efficiency for EMI graduates. By addressing these limitations and pursuing further research in these directions, we can gain a deeper understanding of how EMI programs can be optimized to foster academic succes, long-term career advancement, and successful integration for transnational graduates in the globalized workplace.
