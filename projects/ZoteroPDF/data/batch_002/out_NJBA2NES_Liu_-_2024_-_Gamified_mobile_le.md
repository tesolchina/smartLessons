# ABSTRACT

This study developed a realistic, interactive English blockade-running game that integrates virtual environments and mobile devices to conduct a collaborative and competitive contest to promote English learning among technical college students. In addition, it also explored students’ learning effectiveness, perception of peer collaboration, and the use of grouping strategies for collaborative learning. This study adopted a quasi-experimental design and separated 120 participants into four groups (Baseline, Smartphone, Collaborative Learning, and Smartphone $^ +$ Collaborative Learning). The procedure included the pretest, English blockade-running contest, peer collaboration perception questionnaire, focus interview, and the posttest at the end of the semester. Our findings in terms of learning effectiveness, the Collaborative Learning Group and the Smartphone $^ +$ Collaborative Learning Group exhibited significant improvements in their scores. In terms of peer collaboration, we also found that the Smartphone $^ +$ Collaborative Learning Group reported increased perceptions of collaboration in Take Action and Group Organization dimensions when compared with the Collaborative Learning Group. Regarding grouping strategies for collaborative learning, the Smartphone $^ +$ Collaborative Learning Group used smartphones to ensure continuous communication between team members during both individual and collaborative blockades. Team members performed their respective duties, jointly participated in the contest, and worked together to overcome the challenges of the different blockades. The implications and research limitations are also discussed in this paper.

# Introduction

In the 1950s, Taiwan was an agrarian society with few universities. At the time, higher education was reserved for the elite, and only the wealthiest individuals within a village could attend university. Families that emphasised diplomas and higher education and had higher socioeconomic status tended to be financially able to provide their children with training in special skills and languages at a young age, resulting in attendance at academically oriented high schools and universities (Tsai $\&$ Chiu, 1993). Families with lower socioeconomic status tended to have limited resources to invest in extracurricular learning (e.g. foreign language learning) for their children, often resulting in lower scores on admission tests; therefore, most of these children attended career-oriented vocational schools and technical colleges (Chang & Lin, 2015; Wang, 2003). Since 2000, higher education in Taiwan has expanded and is no longer solely for elites, but educational reforms have failed to bridge class differences in educational resources (Hwang, 2011). Students from more advantaged families still have a higher chance of attending more prestigious national universities (with relatively inexpensive tuition) and graduate schools. For the most part, educational reforms have only increased the opportunity for students from agricultural and industrial backgrounds to attend private universities (with relatively expensive tuition) or technical colleges (Tsai & Shavit, 2007; Tsay, 1997).

Given global competition, enterprises are increasingly likely to require their employees to exhibit a given level of English ability. Apart from the domestic job market, Taiwanese students also have opportunities to seek out overseas career options, making it even more important for them to cultivate their English skills. However, the English abilities of Taiwanese college students prior to admission and the English proficiency of technical college students have much room for improvement because of a lack of interest in English learning and insufficient extracurricular support throughout their previous learning experiences (Cheng, 2015; Ho, 2019; Liu & Chen, 2015; Tsai et  al., 2017). This phenomenon is closely linked to Taiwan’s unique entrance examination culture, which leads students to learn English through memorisation techniques to cope with entrance examination questions (Tsai, 2012). Furthermore, families of lower socioeconomic status often have insufficient budgets to provide their children additional English training opportunities, such as conversation, listening, drama, speaking, singing, or writing classes at institutes outside of school, which indirectly reduces the opportunities for these children to interact and learn with their peers (Chang, 2008) and may even cause these children to feel isolated or lack a sense of accomplishment (Hung et  al., 2015).

Nowadays, advances in wireless technology and information and communication technology (ICT) have resulted in the integration of mobile phone usage into students’ daily lives. Unfortunately, younger students with poor self-regulated learning skills are often overly immersed in the virtual worlds of mobile games. Apart from affecting their academic performance, this may also prevent them from gaining admission to their desired universities (Chou et  al., 2016). Nonetheless, prior research indicates that learning through animation, games, and collaboration activities can enhance students’ English learning outcomes (Liu, 2020; Ramezanali & Faez, 2019; Scholz & Schulze, 2017). To help technical college students understand the importance of English as a foreign language (EFL) skills in future workplaces, teachers should consider the characteristics of these students when developing specific teaching methods or leading educationally meaningful learning activities (Chostelidou et  al., 2014). In particular, learning activities that are both competitive and collaborative can enhance students’ willingness to learn and may further stimulate students’ learning potential, abilities, and interest in foreign language learning (Comas-Quinn et  al., 2012). Therefore, as ICT continues to advance, researchers are investigating how to integrate mobile devices with various learning activities through competitions relating to EFL (Liu, 2020; Kukulska‐Hulme & Viberg, 2018; Sun et  al., 2017).

The purpose of this study was to promote technical college students’ English learning and provide them with more opportunities to collaborate and learn with their peers. Hence, this study developed a realistic, interactive, and virtual environment which integrated an English blockade-running game that allows participants to use mobile devices to collaborate with their peers to overcome the various blockades within the contest. The research questions in this study were as follows:

1. Can integrating mobile devices with collaborative learning improve learning effectiveness?   
2. Can integrating mobile devices with collaborative learning enhance perceptions of collaboration?   
3. How can collaborative learning grouping strategies facilitate team collaboration and learning?

# Literature review

# Mobile device support for English learning

Rapid advances in technology have enhanced the functions and popularity of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. Learners can use mobile devices at any time and in any place to engage in learning tasks (Hwang et  al., 2014; Heil et  al., 2016) and can also learn while on the move (Stockwell, 2007). For example, they can learn English vocabulary on public transportation, in cafes, or when waiting for a bus.

El-Hussein and Cronje (2010) combined mobile communication with learning perspectives, believing that ICT could increase the mobility of learning scenarios, eliminating the restrictions of physical wires and allowing for smooth mobile communication. Mobile learning, also known as ubiquitous learning, describes a learning process unrestricted by constraints of time or location (e.g. school campuses or classes). Ubiquitous learning scenarios can be integrated into daily life—having a mobile device on one’s person ensures that learning activities can be undertaken at any time (Hsu et  al., 2015; White & Mills, 2014). In sum, mobile devices are lightweight, portable, and convenient, offering learners easier access to resources and increasing informal learning opportunities.

Some studies indicated that mobile-assisted language learning has great potential and can be used in both formal and informal learning scenarios, offering students instant, rich, continuous, and convenient learning functionality (Burston, 2013; Hwang et  al., 2014; Kan, 2018). Instructor use of mobile devices for collaborative English learning activities in classroom environments has been found to enhance learning effectiveness in students (Kukulska-Hulme & Viberg, 2018). Mobile devices such as smartphones can be applied in EFL listening practice and can strengthen perceptions of peer interaction during the learning process (Rahimi & Soleymani, 2015). Interactive and peer collaborative learning has been shown to enhance reading ability (Su et  al., 2018) and speaking skills (Pattanpichet, 2011). Furthermore, some studies have suggested that the application of mobile devices in learning scenarios is suitable for adults in short-term and informal learning environments, particularly for individual learning activities such as English vocabulary memorisation, repeated listening, and speaking practice (Al-Shamsi et  al., 2020; Kan, 2018; Sun et  al., 2017). Additionally, a variety of applications (apps) can be downloaded onto smartphones or tablet computers and utilised for mobile learning, providing an innovative method for mobile learning in this modern technological age (Gamlo, 2019).

Language acquisition is gained through a long-term, continued, and accumulative learning process. In consideration of the temporal and spatial limitations on formal learning, this study used mobile devices to build a cyberspace environment that serves an extension for informal English learning, thereby facilitating the establishment of ubiquitous EFL learning environments.

# Collaborative gamified learning

In terms of cognitive development, Vygotsky (1976) argued that games allow children to fulfil desires they are unable to satisfy in real life; games not only facilitate the emotional development of adolescents but also enhance their capability to think for themselves. Previous research (Chen et  al., 2019; Jensen, 2017) found that students enjoyed classes that integrated English games into learning scenarios, which created a pleasant learning atmosphere and simultaneously triggered a sense of competition among peers. Teachers also felt that students thrived within these environments and were better able to retain what they had learned.

Gamified learning environments could provide simulated scenarios that allow users to achieve specific tasks or targets (e.g. role upgrades, point accumulation, finding of rewards, or passing through blockades) and then use the rules of the game to facilitate learning (Tobias et  al., 2014). Users gain valuable experiences through knowledge sharing, information exchanges, and peer interactions that take place during this process, thereby achieving the goals of learning through entertainment and knowledge construction. Liu (2020) found that a gamified learning environment that is both competitive and collaborative can shrink gaps in EFL performance. Additionally, Sun et  al. (2018) emphasised that if learning is integrated with gaming characteristics, the process of learning can become more interesting; furthermore, when designing a gamified learning process, the players, practical and social perspectives, and scenarios should all be taken into consideration. Similarly, if English learning can be fun and simple, technical college students may be inspired to cultivate their English communication skills. Additionally, through engagement with game rules, content, and roleplay scenarios, students can enjoy alternative thinking and experiences during the learning process (Liu & Chen, 2015; Tsai et  al., 2017).

Relevant studies have shown that learning in groups can enhance the learning effectiveness of team members (Janssen et  al., 2009; Kirschner et  al., 2011; Strijbos et  al., 2007). Cooperative learning refers to the participation of two or more people in an activity in which team members communicate and coordinate with each other through an interactive and collaborative process to achieve a goal (Slavin, 1990). Johnson and Johnson (1994) found that cooperative learning is beneficial for improving learner performance, not only by enhancing willingness to invest more time in studying but also by improving learning efficiency. The literature separates cooperative learning into several categories (Slavin, 1995), including methods classified as Learning Together, Student Team Learning, Dyadic Cooperative Learning, and Jigsaw Learning. Of these, the Jigsaw Learning method adopts a heterogeneous grouping strategy (Student Teams—Achievement Divisions, STAD), which entails dividing students into groups based on their abilities. Within the groups, high-achieving students guide low-achieving students, increasing learning motivation in low-achieving students and enhancing their learning performance (Slavin, 1991).

During collaborative learning processes, peers act as collaborators and coordinators who interact with learners of similar age and position on learning tasks. Therefore, learner interaction and cooperation has long been a focus of teachers who use the Jigsaw method (Aronson, 1978). However, in most traditional classroom settings, several students are guided by one teacher, making one-to-one teaching difficult. By contrast, during cooperative learning, peers can play the role of a teacher. During interactions, learners can observe, analyse, judge, and absorb the ideas and behaviours of their peers; peers can also serve as partners that guide learners regarding how to think, communicate, and work together to solve problems (Adams, 2013; Pellas & Boumpa, 2017). Under such circumstances, peers play a key role in the development of individual learning processes through cooperative and interactive experiences (Johnson & Johnson, 1999).

Another form of cooperation is known as ‘collaboration’, which refers to consistent cooperative learning behaviours exhibited by team members to construct a concept. This definition is derived from social constructivist epistemology (Oxford, 1997). This study used the term collaborative learning in lieu of cooperative learning and integrates collaborative Jigsaw learning concepts when designing both competitive and collaborative learning activities for participants.

# English courses and blockade-running games

# Curriculum development

Taiwan’s technical and vocational education tended to focus on practice rather than theory, emphasising hands-on experiences when acquiring knowledge and skills (Huang & Lee, 2012). In vocational schools, EFL lessons received less attention than other practical courses, such as cooking classes for catering students, circuit welding classes for electronic engineering students, and mechanical operations classes for mechanical engineering students. Even if these students later attended technical colleges, their English abilities were often lacking (Tsai, 2012). To provide diverse, competitive, and collaborative EFL learning opportunities for technical college students, this study developed a realistic, interactive, and virtual environment that integrated an English blockade-running game. Through team collaboration, partners learned by competing and through peer interactions as they experienced English learning.

The English blockade-running game in this study was designed around a general education English curriculum (Greek and Roman Mythology) in a technical college. English teachers redesigned the class curriculum according to these themes and extended the course content to cover daily English phrases, following theme-based teaching with daily application skills. For example, stories of the gods in Greek and Roman mythology were adapted to include English phrases used in everyday settings. Easy-to-understand content was paired with multimedia materials and relevant gamified learning activities emphasising reading, listening, and speaking practice.

Course materials were primarily delivered through physical classrooms and online environments. Within the classroom, teachers used slides to lecture on course content and guided students through a formal learning process. Animated digital content based on teacher-provided materials was uploaded on cyber learning platforms for student perusal on handheld mobile devices outside of class hours (e.g. at home or away from home) to facilitate informal learning. Additionally, various tests (e.g. pretests, posttests, midterms, homework quizzes, and blockade activities) were also used to assess learning outcomes.

# Blockade-running game contest and process

To facilitate language acquisition for participants, collaborative learning and gamified learning concepts were integrated into the design of class materials and blockade questions when establishing the English blockade-running game platform. Development of the cloud-based environment used for the contest included sever setup, the development of the English blockade-running game apps, a back-end question database, a blockade game material database, and portfolio files for all participants. Before the contest, blockade hosts were able to set questions for each blockade in the cloud server. Participants were required to use smartphones for mobile interactions during the contest. Apart from using the apps to perform blockade tasks, participants could also use instant messaging apps (e.g. LINE) to communicate with their team members in real time.

All blockades were designed with lifelike, fun, and innovative gamification concepts in mind and were consistent with the course content and targets.

# Home base blockade

The host in charge of the home base blockade was the commander-in-chief, who was primarily responsible for explaining the rules of the English blockade-running game, including time limits and assessment criteria. Once the commander-in-chief announced the start of the game, all teams were required to begin at the home base blockade (the general education centre), after which the system would randomly assign blockades to each team member. After completing all blockade tasks, the teams would return to the home base blockade.

# 12  blockades

In this game, all teams were required to complete 12 blockades within 120 minutes. Team members followed prompts on their mobile phones to arrive at each blockade and log in, after which they had 10 minutes to complete the blockade, including the time needed to watch an animation and answer questions. Blockades were designed to assess English listening, comprehension, speaking, reading, riddle-solving, spelling, and singing skills; physical capabilities; and real-life problem-solving skills. In terms of scoring, multiple-choice or vocabulary questions with standardised answers were directly scored and added to the team’s total score by the system, whereas questions with nonstandardised answers (such as for pronunciation, reading, and singing) were scored by the blockade host, who entered the results into a tablet computer. If a participant gave three consecutive wrong answers, they were eliminated from the game. If participants were uncertain about an answer, they could mark the question as pending. The environments of the English blockade-running contest in this study are illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 2. S martphone blockade route.

# Blockade route

Participants were guided through a blockade route by their smartphone interface, as shown in Figure 2. In the beginning, Leader (A) and Member (B) were randomly assigned to different blockades by the system. As each blockade was in a different building, the system identified the nearest blockade when setting the next blockade on a route. On average, each team member needed to pass six blockades. The green lights in Figure 2 represent blockades yet to be passed, and the flashing green light signals the next blockade on the participant’s route. For Leader (A), the next blockade would be the Apollo blockade in Classroom 10513 of Building I. The yellow light indicates a ‘pending’ question; once all team members finished their individual blockades, they could collaborate to complete the yellow-lit ‘pending’ blockades until all the blockades had been visited. As the system did not provide prompts for collaborative blockades, team members could determine their next blockade via messaging apps. The ‘Show Total Scores’ button in the top right corner allowed team members to view the total accumulated scores at any time, as shown in Figure 3.

# Methodology

This study primarily consisted of quantitative research, which was supplemented with qualitative interviews to enhance the strength of our findings. The difference in student mean score improvements was used as a quantitative indicator to measure learning effectiveness in students. To measure perceptions of collaboration, we used a revised version of the collaborative problem-solving framework of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 2013) combined with three dimensions (Understanding, Taking Action, and Group Organisation) from the Self-Evaluation for Collaboration Experience (Liu et  al., 2019) to measure perceptions of collaboration between peers during the contest. The questionnaire of this study used a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) to guide participants in ranking their feelings towards each question item.

Figure 3. Currently accumulated team points.

Our qualitative data were mainly sourced from focus interviews, which were used to understand how handheld mobile devices and different grouping strategies promote team collaboration and learning. We then compiled and analysed interviewee responses. The interviews comprised the following questions: (1) Could you reflect on the team collaboration and learning you experienced when using smartphones during the contest? (2) Could you reflect on the team collaboration and learning you experienced from the collaborative learning process of this contest? (3)

Could you reflect on the team collaboration and learning you experienced when combining smartphone use with collaborative learning during the contest? The interviews lasted 30 minutes, and the focus interviews for all groups were completed within one week after the contest.

# Participants

The participants were students from a technical college in northern Taiwan who were enrolled in a semester-long general education English course focusing on Greek and Roman mythology. The students were divided into two classes, A and B. Each class had the same instructors and materials; the main difference was that smartphones were used for individual exercises in Class A, whereas students in Class B used their smartphones for group activities. The English blockade-running game was one of the assessment criteria for the course. This study divided students into four groups and used a two-factor experimental design to examine the influence of smartphone use and collaborative learning on English learning.

# Experimental design and procedure

The groupings in experimental design for the English blockade-running game were as follows:

1. Students in the Baseline Group (BG) did not use smartphones, were not separated into teams, and did not engage in any collaborative learning; all the blockade-running processes were conducted manually.   
2. Students in the Smartphone Group (SG) were allowed to use smartphones, but they did not engage in any collaborative learning activities.   
3. Students in the Collaborative Learning Group (CLG) were separated into teams based on a heterogeneous grouping strategy (I) for collaborative learning, but they were not allowed to use smartphones; all blockade-running processes were conducted manually.   
4. Students in the Smartphone $^ +$ Collaborative Learning Group $( { \mathsf { S } } + { \mathsf { C L G } } )$ were allowed to use smartphones, and they were separated into teams based on a heterogeneous grouping strategy (II) for collaborative learning during the English blockade-running contest.

The groupings are shown in Table 1.

Students in all four groups were required to physically participate in the blockade-running contest regardless of smartphone use and collaborative learning strategies. Teams that could use smartphones were required to install the relevant mobile apps in advance and confirm that their mobile devices could connect to the Internet so that they could receive guidance through the blockades, look up resources on the Internet, display contest information, request task assistance, and discuss blockade-running strategies during the contest. Teams that could not use smartphones had to carry paper-based passports in the blockade-running game, which were handled manually.

The grouping strategies within collaborative learning were based on smartphone use or lack thereof. As smartphone use is closely linked to digital literacy (Saxena et  al., 2018), this study adopted a heterogeneous grouping strategy prior to the contest. English proficiency and digital literacy tests were conducted at the beginning of the semester. The English proficiency test included reading and listening sections and was prepared by general education English instructors; the digital literacy test was prepared by general education digital literacy instructors. Subsequently, the widely adopted collaborative learning STAD method was used to separate students into heterogeneous teams (by S type) based on their test scores. Students scoring in the top $5 0 \%$ were placed in the higher achievement group, and students scoring in the bottom $5 0 \%$ were placed in the lower achievement group. For the blockade-running game, each team was composed of two members. To promote collaboration between team members, this study utilised two grouping strategies for collaborative learning: (1) A student with higher English proficiency (team leader) was paired with a student with lower English proficiency (team member) for the CLG teams; (2) A student with higher English proficiency but lower digital literacy (team leader) was paired with a student with higher digital literacy but lower English proficiency (team member) for the $\mathsf { S } + \mathsf { C L G }$ teams. Each team collaborated from the beginning of the semester course until the blockade-running game at the end of the semester. This period lasted approximately 16 weeks. Team learning activities were implemented weekly throughout the course.

The experiment procedure for this study included the English proficiency pretest at the beginning of the semester, the English blockade-running contest, the peer collaboration perception questionnaire, focus interviews, and the English proficiency posttest at the end of the semester. The blockade-running game and procedure were fully explained to the students before the experiment and the English blockade-running contest were initiated. After the contest had concluded, the collaborative learning teams (CLG and $\mathsf { S } + \mathsf { C L G } )$ were required to complete peer collaboration perception surveys, and focus interviews were conducted within one week. Finally, before the end of the semester, all students were required to take an English proficiency posttest. The experiment procedure is exhibited in Figure 4.

# Data analysis

# Learning effectiveness

A total of 120 students participated, ranging in age from 18 to 20 years, of whom 52 were male and 68 were female. These 120 participants were randomly assigned to four different groups (BG, SG, CLG, and $\mathsf { S } + \mathsf { C L G } )$ . Each group contained 30 students. Smartphone use and collaborative learning were the two main factors used to examine learning effectiveness.

Table 2 displays the results of the participants’ pretest and posttest scores. The average pretest score of all students was 60.13 $\mathrm { ( S D = 1 4 . 7 7 } $ ), and the average posttest score was 64.29 $( \mathrm { S D } = 1 3 . 4 0 )$ . Overall, students’ English learning performance improved after participation in our study.

Table 3 contains the results of a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The four groups exhibited no significant differences in pretest scores (F $\ c = \ . 9 3 9$ , $p = . 4 2 4 > . 0 5 )$ , indicating that the English proficiency of students in all groups was similar prior to the contest.

This study used the difference in student mean score improvements as a quantitative indicator to analyse and measure learning effectiveness. Mean score improvements were measured by calculating differences between the posttest and pretest scores. Table 4 records the mean score improvements for each group. BG and SG showed no significant improvements, whereas CLG and $\mathsf { S } + \mathsf { C L G }$ both exhibited significant improvements. Overall, the English learning performance of most students exhibited significant improvements.

Table 5 lists the results of a two-way ANOVA conducted on the scores of each group. No significant differences were noted among the four groups in terms of smartphone use $\mathrm { ( F = } . 6 3 7$ , $p = . 4 2 6 ^ { \cdot }$ , but significant differences were observed between groups in terms of the collaborative learning factor $\mathrm { { \mathit { F } } } = 1 3 . 4 8 7$ , $p = . 0 0 0 < . 0 0 1 )$ . Furthermore, both smartphone use and collaborative learning were shown to have interaction effects $\mathrm { { F } = 4 . 9 9 7 }$ , $p ~ = ~ . 0 2 7 ~ < ~ . 0 5 )$ . We discuss these results further in subsequent sections.

# Perceptions of peer collaboration

During the contest, the CLG and the $\mathsf { S } + \mathsf { C L G }$ adopted different collaborative learning strategies. We therefore used the independent-samples $t$ test to compare three dimensions of perceptions of peer collaboration (questionnaire items shown in Table 6) for these two groups. Analysis results are displayed in Table 7.

First, the Understanding dimension refers to the blockade-running process, task allocation, and the exchange of opinions between peers at the beginning of the contest as well as the level of consensus that could be reached through prior discussion. This study determined that the CLG and $\mathsf { S } + \mathsf { C L G }$ groups exhibited no significant differences in this dimension $( \mathrm { M } _ { \mathrm { C L G } } = 4 . 1 5$ , $\mathrm { M } _ { \mathrm { S + C L G } } = 4 . 0 9$ , $t = 0 . 3 9 3$ , $\begin{array} { r } { p > . 0 5 ) } \end{array}$ . This indicates that the two groups were able to reach some level of consensus prior to the contest, regardless of smartphone use or not. Average peer collaboration perception scores for the Understanding dimension were all greater than 4.

Second, the Taking Action dimension refers to the actions that peers took in response to blockade challenges when collaborating on these tasks, with emphasis on collaborative problem solving, review, and improvement. This study found that students in the $\mathsf { S } + \mathsf { C L G }$ group showed significantly higher peer collaboration perceptions compared with the CLG group $\mathrm { \langle M _ { C L G } } = 3 . 8 5$ , $\mathrm { M } _ { \mathrm { S + C L G } } = 4 . 3 0$ , $t = - 3 . 3 8 5$ , $p < . 0 1 ^ { * * } )$ in the Taking Action dimension, indicating that allowing groups to use smartphones during the collaborative blockade-running process generated greater peer collaboration perceptions compared to the group without smartphone use.

Furthermore, the Group Organisation dimension refers to maintenance of collaborative discipline during the blockade-running process, wherein participants not only took responsibility for their own tasks but also provided appropriate assistance and support to their peers. This study found that the $\mathsf { S } + \mathsf { C L G }$ group showed significantly higher peer collaboration perceptions compared with the CLG group $( \mathrm { { M } _ { \mathrm { { C L G } } } } = 4 . 0 0$ , $\mathbf { M } _ { \mathrm { S + C L G } }$ $= ~ 4 . 4 0$ , $t = - 2 . 5 9 3$ , $\textit { p } < \ . 0 5 ^ { * } )$ in the Group Organisation dimension, indicating that smartphone use during the blockade-running process improved peer support and generated higher levels of self-responsibility during the division of labour. Additionally, the group that was permitted to use smartphones also showed greater perceptions of peer collaboration compared with the group with no smartphone use in the Group Organisation dimension.

# Interview results

To understand how handheld mobile devices and grouping strategies in collaborative learning facilitate team collaboration and learning, this study invited the students in the SG, CLG, and $\mathsf { S } + \mathsf { C L G }$ groups to participate in focus interviews. Some interviewee responses and analyses of them are presented in the following:

1. Smartphone use alone (the SG) was found to have no significant effect on mean score improvement, indicating that smartphone use during the contest had a limited impact on learning effectiveness. Interviewees opined My phone guided me through the blockades, but I still had no idea where to look for resources when I encountered questions that I did not know how to answer… and My phone would provide hints relating to blockade questions, but because my English is not very good, I couldn’t understand the hint even after spending time looking it up on the Internet… Smartphones played the role of a mobile information device and guide during the blockade-running process and even provided hints to blockade questions to help students find Internet resources to answer the questions. Students in the SG had no teams or support from team members, and thus, smartphone use during individual blockades had a limited influence on overall learning effectiveness.

2. The CLG exhibited a significant mean score improvement, indicating that collaborative learning is beneficial for enhancing learning effectiveness. Teams in the CLG were composed of one student with higher English proficiency and one student with lower English proficiency, and some students with higher English proficiency stated, Helping my partner work on their blockade gave me a sense of accomplishment… and During the contest, I learned how to communicate with my partner, and I also learned how to be a good leader…; some students with lower English proficiency stated, I felt less alone when working through the blockades, but when I was working through individual blockades, I felt more anxious and less confident… and The team leader had very strong English abilities and set a good example, but when we encountered questions that even the team leader couldn’t answer, and I was unable to provide any help, I felt less involved in the process… The CLG was based on a heterogeneous grouping strategy according to English proficiency. Students with lower English proficiency were unable to contact their partners and had to rely on their own abilities when working through individual blockades. Although the overall learning effectiveness of students in the group was enhanced, lack of appropriate mobile device usage meant that communication and collaboration between team members during the blockade-running process was interrupted, influencing perceptions of peer collaboration.

The interaction between the two study factors was significant for smartphone use combined with collaborative learning, indicating that the influence of smartphone use on learning effectiveness in the $\mathsf { S } + \mathsf { C L G }$ was affected by the collaborative learning factor. Conversely, the influence of collaborative learning on learning effectiveness was also affected by smartphone use. These teams were composed of one student with higher English proficiency and lower digital literacy paired with one student with higher digital literacy and lower English proficiency. Some interviewees with higher digital literacy stated, When I felt uncertain about a blockade question, I could look up information on the Internet and discuss it with my team members before deciding to answer the question or mark it as pending, so I felt less helpless… and I’m more of an introvert, so for some blockade tasks such as singing English songs, I would use my phone to look up information on the Internet, and ask my partner to answer the question… Additionally, some interviewees with higher English proficiency stated, In order to obtain good results, I would use my phone to keep abreast of team progress, and would conduct timely discussions and adjustments of blockade-running strategies… and When working through collaborative blockades, we would use our phones to find answers and coordinate our strategies so the most appropriate member could complete the tasks… The $\mathsf { S } + \mathsf { C L G }$ was based on a heterogeneous grouping strategy according to both English proficiency and digital literacy. For both individual and collaborative blockade tasks, smartphone usage allowed teams to communicate without interruption. Team members could assume different roles based on their abilities and worked together to overcome different blockade challenges. Making effective use of mobile devices and engaging in teamwork promoted collaboration and learning within teams.

# Discussion

The three research questions introduced in Section 1 are discussed below.

First, in terms of improvements in English learning effectiveness, this study confirmed an interaction effect between smartphone use and collaborative learning. Past studies have reported that Taiwan’s educational reforms lead students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds to attend technical colleges (Tsai & Shavit, 2007); our English blockade-running game demonstrated that simultaneous smartphone use and collaborative learning during the contest helped to improve English learning effectiveness in technical college students. Smartphones not only provided guidance and hints during the blockade-running process but also allowed students to search for information on the Internet, created opportunities for discussion and interaction between team members, and helped participants coordinate with each other to allocate problem-solving tasks to the most suitable team member. This not only allowed students to embody the spirit of collaborative learning but also helped them improve their learning performance, narrowing previously identified gaps in collaborative learning among peers (Cheng, 2015).

Second, this study revealed that combining smartphone use with collaborative learning generated stronger perceptions of collaboration in the Taking Action and Group Organisation dimensions. Gaining an understanding of academic theory through hands-on experience is the essence of technical and vocational education. Similar studies have concluded that peer collaboration was helpful in developing practical skills in the context of technical and vocational training, which tends to emphasise practicality over theory (Chostelidou et  al., 2014; Huang & Lee, 2012). In this study, students with weak English ability were still able to communicate and request assistance from their peers even when working through individual blockade tasks. Therefore, they did not miss opportunities to request support during the blockade-running process. For collaborative blockade tasks, they were not only able to conduct face-toface discussions with their peers but could also use their phones to divide and coordinate task duties. Additionally, team members with strong English proficiency and digital literacy were able to discuss possible answers and review areas for improvement during the blockade-running process; thus, they were able to overcome blockade challenges. During the blockade-running process, peers also learned how to fulfil their responsibilities and support others to meet team targets. Therefore, the Smartphone $^ +$ Collaborative Learning Group exhibited strong and significant perceptions of peer collaboration in both the Taking Action and Group Organisation dimensions. The collaboration experience gained from joint peer participation in practical tasks can doubtlessly benefit students in future English learning. This finding is consistent with the results of previous studies (Liu, 2020; Rahimi & Soleymani, 2015; Su et  al., 2018).

Third, regarding how grouping strategies may promote team collaboration and learning, the Collaborative Learning Group and Smartphone $^ +$ Collaborative Learning Group were formed through different heterogeneous grouping strategies, but the shared characteristic for both groups was that each team had a leader. During the blockade-running process, the team leader had to exhibit leadership in solving problems to complete tasks. Effective leaders had to interact and communicate with their team members. Although team members were not actually designated as mentors and mentees, the process of partnering students with their peers provided mentees with mentors that they could look up to. However, the most meaningful difference between the two groups is attributable to the grouping strategies for collaborative learning. Students with lower English proficiency in the Collaborative Learning Group often felt isolated and helpless during the blockade-running process, especially when working through individual blockades. Even when working through collaborative blockades, they did not have much opportunity to express themselves. Conversely, for the Smartphone $^ +$ Collaborative Learning Group, students with lower English proficiency had greater digital literacy, and thus, they were able to interact with their team leader during both individual and collaborative blockades, such as by looking up resources on the Internet, coordinating blockade tasks, or discussing blockade-running tactics. As a result, they were able to engage in the blockade-running process by making their own contributions. These findings are consistent with the virtuous learning cycles formed through competition and collaboration processes, which not only enhance EFL learning in technical college students (Comas-Quinn et  al., 2012; Liu, 2020) but are also conducive to the initial adjustment to competitive workplace environments in the future (Hoffman, 2011). The heterogeneous grouping strategies for collaborative learning in this study were ultimately beneficial in promoting EFL team collaboration and learning in technical college students. This finding is the primary contribution of this study, which differs from previous research.

# Conclusion and research limitations

This study developed a gamified English blockade-running game that combined the use of handheld mobile devices with collaborative learning to promote English language acquisition among technical college students. Regarding to the first research question, ‘Can integrating mobile devices with collaborative learning improve learning effectiveness?’, our findings from this study showed that the Collaborative Learning Group and Smartphone $^ +$ Collaborative Learning Group exhibited significant improvements in learning effectiveness. Regarding to the second research question, ‘Can integrating mobile devices with collaborative learning enhance perceptions of collaboration?’, the findings revealed that the Smartphone $^ +$ Collaborative Learning Group reported increased perceptions of collaboration in Tack Action and Group Organization dimensions when compared with the Collaborative Learning Group. Regarding to the third research question, ‘How can collaborative learning grouping strategies facilitate team collaboration and learning?’, this study found that paired Collaborative Learning Group students with different levels of one ability (English proficiency) to promote team collaboration and learning. For students with lower English proficiency, the leadership of students with higher English proficiency made them feel less alone and helpless during the learning process and assisted them in building their confidence. In the Smartphone $^ +$ Collaborative Learning Group, students were paired with others with different levels of multiple abilities (digital literacy and English proficiency) to promote team collaboration and learning. This allowed team members to utilise their respective areas of expertise to solve problems and be effective leaders while building a sense of accomplishment in EFL learning.

Although this study provides useful insight for English learning among technical college students by combining smartphone use and collaborative learning, some study limitations should still be addressed. First, the technical college system as discussed in this study has undergone a series of educational reforms. The situation described in this study reflects the English learning process experienced by typical Taiwanese technical college students. The conclusions of this study reached within such a context may not be applicable for other countries or students of other higher education systems. Therefore, additional care should be taken when generalising based on these results. Second, the participants of this study were all technical college students, and we did not conduct further analyses or comparisons of English learning differences in students majoring in different vocational subjects. Some of these potential research issues will be explored further in future research.

For future works, this study recommend that instructors combine smartphones with collaborative gamified learning to develop various learning activities or lesson plans for use in physical classrooms; such materials would allow technical college students to combine smartphone use with various learning activities during the gaming process and would differ from traditional methods used to enhance English learning among students.
