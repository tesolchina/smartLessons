Resistance is a common issue in academic discourse socialisation (ADS), especially for learners who study in their second language. How learners enact agency to negotiate their resistance can largely determine the outcomes of their ADS. In this article, we report the findings of a case study on four Chinese undergraduate students' experiences of an English-for-Academic-Purposes course in an EFL setting. Data sources of the study consist of individual and group interviews with students, observation notes of students' learning processes, students' written reflections, and instructors' teaching journals. By comparing the four individual cases, we analyse the processes and conceptual basis for learners to enact their agency in ADS, underlying their resistance and negotiation of resistance. Specifically, we unravel how their existing conceptions of learning objectives and of learning processes frame their enactment of agency, including their identification of affordances and resources, their formation and development of present-directed intentions, and possibilities for them to construct new future-directed intentions.

# 1. Introduction

Academic discourse socialisation (ADS) refers to learners' development of linguistic and cultural competence to participate in discourse activities in academic communities (Duf, 2010b). For leaners who study through their second language (L2), their ADS can condition their development of disciplinary knowledge and intellctual competence (Atkinson, 2003; Duf, 2007; Wette & Furneaux, 2018). Meanwhile ADS is not astraightforward proces and its outcome can be rather unpredictable (Duff 2010a; Kobayashi et al. 2017). This is because AD is not only a process y which leaners acquire  wider repertoire f ode choices and new forms of cultural knowledge" (Duff 2011, p. 571) it aso involves constant negotiations of complex internal factors, such as one's linguisic needs, academic exectations, personal goals, life historie, social role, and disciplinary identitie, in relation to social, cultural, histrcal, and institutional factors (Kobayashi et al., 2017). When external demands contradict personal needs, goals, and roles, learners can become resistant towards ADS, as manifested in their views, attitudes, and/or behaviours.

Resistance is a common ssue in ADSs (Duf, 2011). How leaners enact their agency to negotiate their resistance can largely shape ADS process and outcomes (Duff & Doherty, 2015; Sung, 2021). As researchers have pointed out, negotiation of resistance is an internal process subject to learners conceptions of the target community and of their rlationship with it (Anderson, 2016; Morita, 2004). Such conceptions are brought into ADS from learners' prior experiences, but few studies have analysed how they frame

learners' enactment of agency for negotiating resistance.

Prior research on L2 ADS focuses on English-as-an-additional-language (EAL) students studying in English-dominant environments, such as North America (Friedman, 2021). For those students, a major challenge in academic learning stems from their unfamiliarity with Anglo-western academic discourse norms (Wett & Furneaux, 2018). When they try to socialise themselves into Anglo-Western academic discourse norms through accomplishing academic tasks, how they interpret task requirements is found to be shaped, if not constrained, by their prior learning experiences (Duff & Kobayashi, 2010). It is therefore necessary to try to provide English-for-Academic-Purposes (EAP) courses in students home contexts before they go abroad, as a preparation for their future ADS. Such EAP courses, if taught in Englih, alo involves an ADS proces, but is target community is not immediately preset but is argely represented by L2 academic texts. This provides an interesting and rarely researched context for studying L2 ADS. In an EAP course that we taught and researched, resistance emerged as a noticeable phenomenon from some students. In this article, we analyse how students' conceptions of learning enable and circumscribe their enactment of agency in L2 ADS, underlying their restance and negotiation of resistance. The EAP course, rather than students' life world, provides a focused environment for our analysis.

# 2. Resistance and agency in second language socialisation

Resistance in L2 socialisation, including L2 ADS, refers to learners' refusal to accept or comply with certain norms of linguistic and cultural practice in a target community. It can be demonstrated as deviant views, ambivalent or defiant attitude, and/or learning behaviours resulting from reduced motivation for discourse assimilation or social participation (Duff, 2010a, 2011; Kulick & Schiefflin, 2004). Learners resistance towards L2 ADS usuall results from a range f practical and ideological factors such as contradictions between personal lif traectories and norms of the target community, and contradictions between internal needs and external expectations (Duff, 2007). As existing research shows, while resistance can impede learning, learners can exercise their agency to negotiate contradictory factors and to turn feelings of resistance into resilience, confidence, perseverance, and resourcefulness; they can turn adverse experiences into intellectual asets that benefit their long-term development (Anderon, 2016; Deters et al., 2015; Newman & Newman, 2009; Sung, 2021).

Agency is widely acknowledged as a decisive factor in language socialisation (Duff & Doherty, 2015; Morita, 2004). As a hypo thetical concept, it refers to an individual's capacity for taking initiatives to act upon the surrounding world, rather than being passie recipients of external orders (Duff & Doherty, 2015; van Lier, 2008). Agency is manifested in individuals acts of engaging with, and exerting influence over, extenal contexts (Mercer, 2012). In ADS, having suficient agency means that leaners can actively choose to socialise themselves (or not) into a target academic community. gency is a dynamic \*interactional achievement rather than astatic competence (Duff & Doherty, 2015, p.57) It is both inrapersonal and interpersonal, .., generated by an individual's internal "will to act' and shaped by external socio-cultural contexts (Mercer, 2012, p.42).

At the intrapersonal level, an individual's \*will to act" involves two types of intentions: future-directed intentions (F-intentions) and present-directed intentions (P-intentions) (Bratman, 1987; Pacherie, 2007). F-intentions are overarching intentions formed at the conceptual level, transcending specific situations of action (Pacherie, 2007). In ADS, they are typically represented by long-term personal goals formed through prior experiences, serving as an overall guidance of what learners think and do. P-intentions are specific, context-bound intentions formed by situated reflections; they serve directly for implementing particular actions and for monitoring such implementation (Gallagher, 2012). Unlike F-intentions that tend to be general and relatively stable, P-intentions are specific and dynamic. They take shape as individuals try to cope with changing environments. In ADS, P-intentions are formed as learners encounter specific ADS opportunities, demonstrated by specific decisions to participate (or not participate) in particular events, to assume (or not assume) certain roles, and to conduct (or not conduct) certain behaviours.

At the interpersonal level, agency is mediated by socio-cultural factors as individuals interact with external environments (Mercer, 2012). In ADS, while external environments may offer a wide range of affordances and resources for learners, only those that are perceived by learners as personall relevant can be intentionally utilised for ADS purposes. In other words, ADS is largely about self-socialisation, depending on \*internal socialisation" processes (Anderson, 2016, p. 2; see also: Duff & Dohert, 2015; Lee & Bucholtz, 2015; Newman & Newman, 2009).

The enactment of agency in ADS, demonstrated in inrapersonal and interpersonal dimensions, can be ilustrated by a framework (Fig. 1). The framework, adapted from Duff and Doherty (2015), suggests that learners enactment of agency is a cyclical proces. It divides one cycle of agency enactment into four distinctie phases, although in reality diffrent phases may not always have clear-cut boundaries. Intilly, the enactment of agency origina from general F-intentions (., peronal goals). As leners identify valuable affordances and recourses in external environments, specific P-intentions are formed. P-intentios, under the influence of internal and external factors, are then exhibited as observable ADS behaviours, such as investment in learning, foci of learning, and levels of participation (Duff & Dohert, 2015). When those behaviours receive responses from external environments, they may stimulate learners to reflect upon initial F-intentions, which entails opportunities for F-intentions to be expanded or transformed.

Fig. 1. Learners' enactment of agency demonstrated in ADS process.

Within this framework, resistance is demonstrated as negative P-intentions (i. resistant views and attitudes towards ADS) and deviant behaviours (e.g., non-participation or rejection of ADS requirements). Prior research has examined psychological manifes tations of learners' agency in ADS, in such terms as selfregulation, self-monitor, or self-position (Anderson, 2016). It has conceptualised the rol of instructors as mediators of psychological proceses underlying ADS, guiding learnersto deliver presentations, to participate in conversations, to voice opinions, and so on (e.g., Kobayashi, 2016; Morita, 2004). In this article, based on research findings from an EAP course, we examine learners' enactment of agency by analysing its conceptual basis within a psychological framework. We envision instructors' role from an epistemological perspective, as someone who can facilitate the development of learner agency by identifying and expanding it conceptual basis. Our research question is: How was students' enactment of agency demonstrated in ADS processes in the EAP course?

# 3. Methods

The study took place in a newly designed EAP course at a university in Beijing. As instructors, we designed and cotaught the course, where one of us was responsible for lecture sessions and the other for practice-oriented sessions. That form of co-teaching was not uncommon in this university, particularly in language courses. Teaching a new course, we were unable to predict how students would perceive the course, engage in learning activities, or react to learning asessment. The need for understanding students motivated us to conduct this study, and we found the situation compatible with the case study approach suitable for investigation into a current eent within reallife context over which rearchers have lie control (in, 2009). Sficll, it meant that we did not have strong assumptions about or control over how students might respond to the course. When students resistance emerged as an ssue, we decided to research into it.

# 3.1. Context and participants

The EAP course was part of four-year innovativebilingual undergraduate programme that enrolled students who scored high in the national college entrance examination. 24 second-year Chinese-speaking students (aged 18.8 on average, 22 females and 2 males) took the course. Their average English proficiency was equivalent to C1 or near-C1 of the European Common Framework, as was demonstrated by an annual language proficiency test towards the end of their irst year. During the four years, they received intensive language instruction in English and French during the first two years, and would then go abroad to study international politics or international economics as their specialised disciplines. In English courses during the first year, they leaned contemporary and classic essays of non-academic topics. Afterwards, they took the EAP course in the second year to prepare for their study abroad. When they took the EAP course, they had little knowledge of any academic discipline or of academic genre, as they had not been suficiently exposed to academic readings in the past, neither in Chinese nor in English.

Because the course was acurriculum-innovation initiative, the study was originally intended to be an action research, to identify students' learning diffculties and to solve teaching problems. Six students, among the 24, were initiallyselected as research participants based on their English language proficiency, i.e, two among the top students, two from the lower group, and two from the average cohort. As two of the six students did not exhibit restance during the coure, only data from the other four students were used in the present study: Cao and Bing were among the top; Wan was an average student; Mou, the only male participant, was the least proficient. As we had taught those students in their first year and developed cordial relations and mutual trust with them, they gave their consent to the collection and use of their data. During the course of teaching and research, we were further reassured because they not only showed cooperative attitudes towards research-related interactions but also shared with us their personal reflections on learning experience and university life. In this article, all student names are pseudonyms.

The EAP course was taught in English throughout. As instructors, we both obtained Ph.D. degree i applied linguisics/education, respectively from a universty of foreign studies in China and a world-renowned university in the UK. We had rich experiences with EAP, having written and published in English in international journals. From our perspective, the course primarily aimed at guiding students to understand academic texs as they leaned to socialise themselves into Anglo-Western academic discourse conventions. The course materials were introductory chapters of widely used English textbooks for arange of humanities and social ciences disciplines, with minimal jargons and suitable for beginners. They were hence considered inguisticall accessble to the students. Thestudents were positioned as newcomers to academic learning, aiming to understand the nature of academic disciplines as is introduced in the texts, rather than merely learning the English language. They were supposed to understand texts through discerning how linguistic/ generic features served as a vehicle to convey meaning in disciplinary contexts. For instance, they had to figure out how arguments were constructed in order to understand authors views. We explained such positioning to students at the beginning of the course and of each unit. It was hoped that, by comparing introductory texts among diffrent discipline, students could acquire practical and situated knowledge of academic genre (Storch et al., 2016).

The course lasted for a term of 16 wees (6 h per week). It was divided into five units, and the theme of each unit was designed not based on the structure of an academic discipline, but on the structure of learning process understanding concept, analysing arguments, processing disciplinary knowledge, and applying such knowledge (Table 1). Course assessment involved two parts: (1) test papers where students were asked to distinguish key argument from supporting details in real academic texts, and (2) formative assesment conssting of writing summary, synthesis, and critique, where students were given fedback and opportunities for revision.

Throughout the course, our central role as instructors was to guide the students to familiarise with conventional academic genre and to make use of linguistic devices to accomplish leaning tasks. We facilitated students learning in three ways. irst, upon learning a new text, we explained the purpose of learning and the ways in which learning tasks were to serve the purpose. We also explained how certain tass differed from language-drill tass that the students were familiar with. For example, when a new concept such as displacement was to be learned from an introductory text to general linguistics, we first explained why an accurate understanding of academic concepts was indispensable, and then explained how one could understand a concept as was elaborated and/or exemplified in a particular text (rather than to merely lok for it dictionary meaning). Second, we demonstrated key steps required for sucessul completion of learning tasks. For example, when students were asked to figure out the functions of different sections in an academic article, we encouraged them to first identify the writing purpose of each section and then to notice textual features that helped to achieve that purpose (rather than to merely absorb scattered information or to learn isolated language points). Third, we explained in detail how learning would be asessed and why. Throughout the course, we naturally observed students responses in order to monitor the learning progress of each student.

# 3.2. Data collection and analysis

Data was collected from interviews and written protocols. The second author had one individual interview in Chinese with each of the four participants approximately every four weeks, i., towards the end of September, October, November, and December 2019. He also had a group interview with allof them in the first week of January 2020, when the course ended. Individual and group interviews totalled up to 17 sessions. They were mostly open interviews where the participants were invited to talk about their understandings of and feelings about the course including its objectives, activities, and asessment. Participants were also encouraged totlk about their difficulties and coping strategies. Each interview lasted about $2 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ , and interview questions were contextualised for each participant. In order to reduce the possible uneasiness that the students might fee as interviewees, we decided not to make recordings but to take notes during the interviews. Fieldnotes covered the main points that the students made and were used primarily as an aid for us, as instructors, to respond to their lerning isues. For rearch purposes, ieldnotes were rearranged immediately after the interviews to minimise inaccuracy and incompleteness caused by memory loss. Therefore, the participants' quotes used for data analysis and presented in this aticle were a combination of interviewees utterances and our summary. This is a methodological limitation, as is a likely case in Classroom-Based Qualitative Research particularly when ethical isues are involved (De Costa et al., 2019, p.125). Such limitation is compensated for by our close contact with students in and out of class We met the participants in 9 individual confer. encing sessions that they requested for tutoring. We both took fieldnotes during those sessions. In addition, we colected students written reflections, as long as they were willing to write and share, on their learning gains and problems. Altogether, the four participants shared with us 29 writte rflections, ranging from 121 to 509 Chinese characters with English words (as they occasionally engaged in translingual practice). As instructors, we observed thestudents closely in natural lassroom interactions. We paid attention to their questions, views, and behaviours. On that basis, we wrote teaching journals for both pedagogical and research purposes.

We conducted three rounds of data analysis. In the irst round, we employed the biographical method to analyse data from all sources in a chronological order, to capture the participants' accounts of learning experiences (Johnson & Golombek, 2002). We created a biographical profile for each participant, and described in detail their learning trajectories and emotional fluctuations. As data, particularly interview data, were collected at regular intervals, participants learning traectories were not diffiult to portray, each resembling a synopsis of their learning narrtives. In the second round, we scrutinised and compared the participants' personal profiles identifying recurring pattens related to codes categorised by behavioural and emotional changes. We discovered that the participants' ADS experiences developed in three stages: confronting the new currculum, handling the stress caused by such confrontation, and reflecting upon their resistance towards the curriculum. Resistance emerged as a major theme. In the third round, we reorganised the data in corrspondence to the three stages with a particular focus on students' resistance, including how their resistance was manifested and how they negotiated their resistance. In data analysis,to ensure the trustworthiness of conclusions, we, the two researchers, first coded and interpreted the data independently, and then discussed our respective findings. Through dis cussion, we achieved agrement regarding the categories of codes and the major stages as were presented above. Alldata was collected in Chinese, and translated into English when presented in this article.

# 4. Enactment of agency in ADS: The four cases

Findings on students' enactment of agency are structured by the framework in Fig. 1. For each case, we first present the overarching goals that the student participant had when the course commenced (i.e. F-intentions). Then we show how s/he undersood the curricular goals, identified affordances and resources, and formed specific decisions (i.e, P-intentions) as situated responses to learning tasks. That was where resistant views and attitudes emerged and where the participant negotiated his/her resistance. Finally, we delineate ADS behaviours as observable outcomes of such negotiation.

# 4.1. Cao: "I do need to know my place"

Cao had always regarded herself as a \*fairly good student," one who should excel in exams that could \*directly show [her] place over [her] pers." (individual interview, October 2019; italic for emphasis by researchers) Before the course started, she was worried about course assessment. She said:

I was hoping that you could tel us in very specific terms how we would be tested, for example, how language points would be tested, the format of exams, and how scores for each test would be calculated .. I do need to know my place in the class. (group interview, January 2020)

To reach her goal of obtaining a high score and a bettr \*place' in her clas, she employed learning strategies that had been previously effective:

To prepare for the unit test, I looked up every important new word in the dictionary to learn the [sample] text you showed us. I compared thir English meanings with Chinese translations. leaned their usage shown in example sentences . I tried to use them in my writing. (individual interview, October 2019).

To her frustration, however, none of those was directly tested. In the test for Unit 1, for instance, students were asked to match paragraphs with section headings (such as \*introduction' and literature review') of empirical research papers. Lexical learning was not sufficient tonable her to identif which section a paragraph might belong to. That led her toreflect upon her learning strategies to figure out where they did not align with the curricular goals:

I vaguely understand what the course is intended to do. Yes, it tries to help us learn to use English to learn other things .. I understand why we have to do what we do in class, because you have explained it .. But I am not clear about what \*using English to lean other things" includes, or what it means specifically . It's not like general Englih, which includes knowledge and skil. It's easy to se through exams whether I have improved regarding knowledge and skills So how shall I know if I succeed in enhancing my competence in using English to learn other things? (individual interview, November 2019)

Highly confused, Cao developed a strong sense of distrust towards both of us s instructors for our teaching and towards herself for those previously effective learning strategies. When she was later outscored by students whom she had often outscored, she became even more confused about the value of course materials and learning activities. Nonetheles, she did not further negotiate curricular goals or learning strategies with the instructors. Instead, she invested more into repeating her prior learning behaviours:

In each class I tried and tried and tried, ut stll I couldn' ee what I needed to learn . After clas, I tried todo all tasks again that we had done in class, sometimes again and again, but I didn't see where I got improved .. because I don't know if I can outscore my classmates in the course assessment .. I have serious doubt about the necessty of such a course (interview, November 2019)

This shows that Cao stuck with her pre-determined goals of outscoring her classmates, and that her confusions were not resolved. While she invested more in learning, her conceptions of the course remained unchanged. Consequently, she became increasingly sceptical about the value of the course.

# 4.2. Wan: "This is not an English course"

Unlike Cao, Wan did not care much about her score. She attached greater importance to her improvement in English language skills. That was probably why she resented the EAP course - she believed that it failed to promote her English skills:

I don't know what this course is ll about .. How can it improve my Englis skills? I can't see ny part of the course that helps me improve them. It is not about any of the skill. either the texts nor the activities are for sil training ..I don't know howI can improve, and even worse, what I am to improve on. (written reflection, December 2019)

Her facial expressions in class betrayed her boredom, which drew our atention even from the beginning of the course. When one of us, .e. the seond author, took the initiative to ask her if there was anything diicult to understand, she ut on a strong air of refusal, saying that everything was fine (teaching journal, September 2019). Meanwhile, she almost never answered questions in class or participated in discussions (teaching journal, November 2019). She recalled that she did not even care to prepare for unit tests as she found it \*a waste f time. (written reflection, December 2019) A few weeks afer the course started, she became openly critica f the course:

I'm afraid I may waste ots of time learning thi course ..I am giving up on it. I am not giving up on my learning though. Iwill learn on my own to improve my English skills. (individual interview, October 2019)

She took the initiative to purchase a few English for General Purpose textbooks for university English major students, and learnt English with them (individual interview, October 2019). She thought that as an English major student, \*the primary learning goal should be the English language per se' (group interview, January 2020), and that it was "a detour to learn English by learning something els other than the language iself. (individual interview, November 2019; italics for emphasis by researchers). The goals intended by the EAP course did not enable her to reach her pre-determined goals, as she concluded towards the end of the term:

This is not an English course. This course does not teach English at ll.. The course focuses on how English can be used to do something else that I don't have the slightest interest in. (written reflection, December 2019)

As can be seen, her goal of improving English skill was hardly negotiable. Once she was convinced that the EAP course provided no affordances or resources for ehancing language skills she showed a total disregard. With such a restant atitude, she responded passively to most of the learning tasks.

# 4.3. Mou: "I can learn it later"

Like Cao and Wan, Mou did not identify with the curricular goals, although he was aware that the course aimed to "enable students to use English to learn things other than the language iself." individual interview, December 2019) As a university student, Mou's personal goal was to become cerified public accountant, and he said that he did not wish to invest in \*anything that did not serve this purpose directly or indirectly." (individual interview, September 2019) Regarding the EAP course, he said:

I didn't expect the courseto be of much help to me [to pass the qualification test for being an account] . I was trying to see if there was anything interesting, but there wasn't much to my interest. I do not have a strong interest in literature or psychology. (written reflection, December 2019)

The course is not what I think I need to learn . Then I try to optimise my efforts. I dont want to fail the course, nor do I wish to get a high score. (individual interview, November 2019).

As Mou found the course uninteresting and irrelevant to his personal goal of becoming an accountant, he decided that he only needed to survive the course as a mandated part of his undergraduate programme. To that end, he tried to moderate his learning investment to a minimum of fforts, which semed to be a kind of unarticulatd resistance. Such restance was manifest in the extract below:

I didn't lean very hard. Although I would care if I dn't lean wel, I don't care very much about his course. Perhaps I just take it as a selective course .. When I need to use English for academic purposes in my future job, I can learn it later. group interview, January 2020)

More often than not, I didn't preview the text as thoroughly as you required. But I would make sure that I understood the gis so that I would be able to rub along in class. (individual interview, December 2020).

These extracts reveal that Mou seemed to deal with his initial reistant feelings with some resilience, especiall compared with Wan. He adopted a\*gothrough-the-motions strategy, neither truly engaged in lerning nor desperately opposing it. He did not tilise the opportunity to enhance his abilit of using English to gain disciplinary knowledge, which was the objective of the course as he understood it. Towards the end of the course, he reflected:

I don't blame anyone for my [low] score in the test. Neither you nor I myself am responsible for that . simply didnt do enoug. to get enough. (individual interview, December 2019)

Mou understood that, because he did not invest much, he did not gain much from the course. As he considered the course un important to himself, he found it unnecessary to strive to respond to challenges like many other students did in the course.

# 4.4. Bing: "A non-English course"

Unlike Cao, Wan or Mou, Bing had not had a clear goal when the course commenced. She thought that \*there must be a reason why we are required to take this course. individual interview, December 2019) At the beginning, she found herself unable to understand the curricular goals, i.e., \*what it truly meant to learn things with English." individual interview, October 2019) That made her anxious and frustrated. She wrote in a wrtten reflection: \*It isanxiety provoking . and makes me suffer tremendously, which somehow makes me dislike thecourse .. There are to many new words in the text we are learning. It makes me think that my vocabulary is oo limited. (wien reflection, Stmber 2019) In a later intervie, she realled her intial conctions of the course as it just began:

You gave us lots of materials, materials that were not easy to understand. They were presented tous as a challenge, so that we would know that our English was far from being good .. If you didn't tell us that the materials were selected from authentic academic texts, I would never have known how incapable I was of learning anything serious and academic. (individual interview, November 2019)

As can be seen, Bing initiall undersood the course as aiming at enhancing students language competence to cope with chal. enging materials, which deviated from goals that we had explained, i., of using English for academic learning. Therefore, Bing levoted much time to dealing with the language of the course materials:

I read sentence by sentence, checking every word and phrase that I didn't know or didn't know for sure ...I even translated sentences that were difficult to understand. When I couldn't translate, I asked the instructors for help. (written reflection, October 2019)

As we remembered as instructors, Bing consulted us for more than 20 times during the course about the structure of difficult sentences, much more than messages conveyed by those sentences. Thus, we advised her to pay closer attention to what the author was trying to communicate (teaching journal, September 2019). She graduall leant to do so, and developed a new understanding of the curricular goals:

I now think this course can also be taken as a non-English course [italics as literally translated from participant's original wording], although it uses English throughout . Englih is only a means, and the real purpose is to deal with the content. o be honest, even in Chinese I lack the ability of dealing with academic materials. (individual interview, October 2019)

With the new understanding, Bing began to focus more on the content. She treated clasroom activities diffrentl, ehibiting more willingness to engage in different learning tasks:

Once I understand it as a different course, I'm happy to try and learn in different way . I've had no previous experience of writing a synthesis. Then I closely fllow your guidance. Step by step, I accomplish something, although I don't seem to be able to describe what it is. Anyway, I've learnt to do it .. Towards the end of the term, I think I've achieved a lot. (individual interview, December 2019)

As is shown above, Bing invested solid efforts to \*try and learn' despite her initial dislike for the course. She overcame her resistance and engaged in learning activities as guided by the instructors. A teaching journal written by one of us reveals Bing's substantial progress:

During an individual conferencing session, I noticed that she [Bing] had taken thick notes, marking heavily on the reading material .. She showed me a paragraph of her synthesis, based on categorisation of the content of the chapter [the reading material. I told her that some of the categories overlapped, which made the synthesis llogical. She listened attentively, and nodded . n week's time, she submitted a revised version of her ynthesis I was amazed t see thati had compelling logic... made some minor changes and shared it with the whole clas as an excellent example. (teaching journal, December 2019; see Appendix for Bing's synthesis with our minor revision)

This extract illustrates that Bing made substantial progress in ADS as was intended by the course.

# 5. Enactment of agency and its conceptual basis

The four students' ADS experiences can be categorised into two patterns. Pattern A is exemplified by the experiences of Cao, Mou, and Wan. Their agency is demonstrated as clear and fixed F-intentions, serving as their conceptual basi for identifing affordances and resources, fr forming P-intentions, and for guiding ADS behaviours. Their ADS proces forms a single closed cycle (Fig. 2). Pattern B is exemplifid by Bing's experience. Her agency is demonstrated as taking the initiative to expand existing conceptions of affordances and resources, and to transform P-intentions on the basis of newly formed conceptions. Her ADS processcan be llustrated as a spiral involving two cycles (Fig. 3). By comparing the two patterns, we analyse the students' enactment of agency from threeaspects: identification of affordances and resources, formation and development of P-intentions, and possbilities for constructing new Fintentions.

# 5.1. Identification of affordances and resources

Agency was first enacted as the students tried to identify valuable affordances and resources, i.e., to make sense of the EAP course and to decide how to approach it. In Pattern A, the students understood the course through the lens of their F-intentions, i., to earn high core in Caos case, to enhance English language skill in Wan's case, and to become an accountant in Mou'scase. They used thir pre-determined F-intentions as criteria for judging the value of the course, and rejected affordances and resources that they believed would not enable them to fulfll their F-intentions. In Patten B, the student, Bing, did not sart with clear F-intentions. When she first encountered difficulties in reading, she interpreted the course as an opportunity for improving her English and took on the challenge. Meanwhile, she created opportunities for negotiating with the instructors about learning issues. Gradually, by trying to adopt the instructors perspectives, she changed her intial conceptions and learned tosee the course as an opportunity not for learning English but for gaining content knowledge through using the English language.

The students' existing conceptions of learning objectives was found to filte their conceptions of ADS affordances. Al four students initilly thought that the course was aimed at enhancing English language competence, which was an objective that they were familiar with in their prior experience as English learners. When they realised that the EAP course was not an English course, but was about "using English to learn other things, they could not conceptualise the nature of the competence to be developed in themselves. From the instructors perspective, the course was to develop students practical knowledge of academic genre, which was tacit and dynamic, different from language skills or content knowledge (Storch et al., 2016). Such knowledge, however, existed beyond the students existing conceptions of knowledge and skills that could be developed in language or content courses. Consequently, they could not rationalise what to focus on in their learning or how to measure their learning progress. While researchers have developed un. derstandings about the nature of ADS competence (Friedman, 2021), our findings means that it i also important for such insights to be shared by students.

Relevant to this issue was the way in which the students judged the value of course materials. The instructors' selected course material from different academic disciplines to enrich students' understanding of dynamic genre features and to expose them to Anglo-western academic norms and values, but the students, such as Wan and Mou, semed to care only about topics directly related to their F-intentions. While it is natural and legitimate for students to withdraw from topics that they are not interested in, using predetermined goals as the sole basis for judging the value of resources may shut the door towards learning opportunities previously unknown. Bing, by contrast, managed to make fullr use of the course by renewing her conceptions of course materials. Her renewed conceptions would potentially enable her to consider more factors when deciding on whether/how to socialise herself.

# 5.2. Formation and development of P-intentions

In this study, the formation of P-intentions rfers to how the students decided what to do once they formed their conceptions of the course. The development ofP-intentions refersto the extent to which P-intentions changed throughout ADS processes. In Patten A, the students P-intentions were primarily inherited from their F-intentions, which then remained relatively stable throughout the course, serving as unchanging purposes underlying ADS behaviours. The students reected ffordances and resources that they could not relate to their F-intentions, and some of them enacted their agency to find other resources to fulfil pre-determined goals. In Pattern B, Bing did not start with a specific F-intention; she formed her P-intentions as she interacted with course materials and the intructors. Her Pintention (I) was formed as sh found herelf lacking suficient English language skill to handle course materil. Her P-intentio (I) was formed as she was reminded by the instructors to focus on messages communicated through language rather than on isolated sentences. The change from P-intention (I) to P-intention (I) demonstrated her agency, as the initiative taken to reconceptualise affordances and resources. That enabled her to adopt a previously unknown perspective for conceptualising learning issues.

Epistemologicall, the two patterns of agency enactment manifested different conceptions of learning. For students who followed Pattern A, leaning was likely to be a means of reaching pre-determined goal (F-intentions), whereas for those who followed Patten B, learning was more like an exploration into previously unknown areas not always immediately relevant to one's F-intentions. As ADS behaviours are usually shaped by a multitude of internal and external factors (Kobayashi, 2016), such conceptions of learning cannot predict measurable learning outcomes. However, they may constrain the scope of possibilities that learners can recognise beyond pre-determined goals.

Without denying that meaningful learning may have happened to Cao, Wan, and Mou elsewhere, and beyond the limited scope of data that we obtained, it is reasonable to associate the conceptions of learning underlying Pattern A with an instrumental view of learning, i.e., the tendency for investing more in observable and measurable learning outcomes than in proceses that cannot be directly reflected by course scores, especiall in short terms. Such a view of learning could be detrimental, such as in this EAP course where the practical knowledge of academic genre that it aimed to cultivate could hardly be transmitted or assessed like content knowledge (Morita & Kobayashi, 2008). As prior research suggests, if learners only put emphasis on the extrinsic value f learning they are likely to miss important leaning opportunities (Kobayashi et l., 2017). The conceptions of learning underlying Pattern B, by contrast, entails more possbilities for learners to construct bigger conceptual frameworks for reflecting upon existing goals and developing new goals. This proces can be les observable and may involve more uncertainties, but from an educational perspective, it contributes to the development, rather than mere enactment, of learner agency, and can thus have more liberating efects upon learners' intellectual development.

# 5.3. Possibilities of constructing new F-intentions

Throughout the course, the students were found to participate in ADS in different degrees and in different ways. Their foci of attention also varied. We recognise that ADS behaviours are driven by multiple factors in addition to one's P-intentions, such as the need for not failing the course, habitual obedience of instructors guidance, external ressure, and so on (Duff 2011). Regardess of students motives and foci, l forms of participation ma have positive, probably delayed effets and may bcome affordances for ADS in the long term (Duff & Doherty, 2015). Meanwhile, when we compare the four students' experiences, Bing's participation in ADS activitie, such as synthesis writing and revision, stood out as categorically diffrent, characterised by the transformation of her P-intentions. At the behavioral lel, such transformation appeared to have only led to increased learning effrt, but at the epistemological level, the newly formed P-intention (Il) indicated that she was participating in ADS for different purpose. Presumably, a change in one's purpose can open up more possbilitie for future learning (rather than predicting definite learning outcomes).It can provide a wider experiential base for constructing new F-intentions, for absorbing previously unknown perspectives, and for making sense of future experiences based on expanded F-intentions. This is why Pattern B is illustrated as a spiral, where the iner cycle demonstrates P-intention (I) stemming from existing conceptions of learning and the outer cycle demonstrates the formation of P-intention (II) leading to an open end.

This is not to say that the construction of new F-intentions would definitely happen to Bing rather than to other students, because, given the complexity of ADS and the limited data collected for this study,all students may go through such transformation when they encounter theight opportunity. In this atice, by highlighting the catgorical differences btweenth two patterns, we argue for the necessit of understanding agency from an epistemological perspective. By nature, F-intentions are set of conceptions that learners hold about what they should do, based upon their understanding of their relationship with the world that they inhabit. Existing research on internal socialisation usually takes F-intentions as the starting point for leaners enactment of agency and looks into its psychological manifestations (e.g., Anderson, 2016). It has rarely examined -intentions as the eistemological basis that both enable and circumscribe the enactment, and development, of learner agency. Our study shows that the epistemological basis for ADS can be identified by observing leaners' negotiation of ADS isues, including the range of alternatives that they conceive and ways in which they maintain or transform established learning routines. Research from this angle is essentially a situated analysis of learners reasoning process underlying their decisions for self-socialisation. Whil it has long been recognised that existing conceptions of learning serve as premise for learners to rationalise decisions in learning (e.g., van Lier, 1996), in real instructional settings, it is necessary to identify specific conceptions held by particular learners, in order to understand how their ADS possibilities are cond. tioned and how they can e expanded. In that light, ADS is a means to the development f individual agency rather than an end in itelf. Such understanding opens up more directions for future research, especiall from the perspective of whole-person education.

# 6. Conclusion and pedagogical implications

In this article, based on the findings of acase study on four undergraduate students experiences in an EAP course, we have analysed how learners' existing conceptions of learning objectives and of learning proceses may frame their enactment of agency in ADS, including their identificatio f ffordances and reources, their foration and dveloment of P-intentions, and possibilities for them to construct new F-intentions. Pedagogicall, the study implies that the mediating role of instructors in ADS can be understood and performed from an epistemological perspective. Although in our EAP course we, as instructors, might not have fully actualised this role, our research indicates that, in general, it is possible and necessary for instructors to facilitate learners ADS process at the conceptual level. They can, for instance, raise students' awareness of their existing conceptions of learning, negotiate those concetions with learners from multiple perspectives, and expand the conceptual basis for learners to understand the meaning of ADS events. When such mediating roles are performed appropriately, instructors can hope to facilitate the creation of more learning opportunities for learners' ADS with potential transformative effects.

# A Synthesis of opinions against Elton's view of history (written by Bing)

E. H.Carr (1892-1982) is a representative of postmodern historians whose view contradict that of the traditional historians, represented by Geoffrey Elton. Carr's argument for "a more sensitive approach to historical evidence" (p.7) is elaborated in his work What is History? (1961).

To postmodernists like Carr, history is interpretations or explanations striving to get near to the truth of the past. This view can be illustrated from three aspects:

(1) the inevitability of subjectivity and the underlying cause;   
(2) the impossibility to arrive at historical truth;   
(3) the task and method of history different from those advocated by traditional historians.

First, "subjectivity is unavoidable" (p.14), resulting from rooted causes. One is that human beings all inhabit particular social and political environments' (p.14) which influence them constantly and imperceptibly; the other is that historians are "part of the process of doing history" (p.7) rather than an onlooker who construct the recording job, while they are simultaneously \*working with particular values, ideologies and interpretations" (p.14) and "unable to separate prejudices and presuppositions from conclusions drawn solely from evidence" (p.7).These two factors lead to an imperfect neutrality of approaching evidence, according to Carr, "our approach to historical evidence can never be objective or dispassionate" (p.25).

Second, Carr as a postmodernist "denies that historical truth is possible" (p.14). What historians come up with postmodernists call them "interpretation", "explanation" or "conclusion", which "are always open to challenge" (p.13) and therefore "can never be self-evident truths (p.13). Even narratives based on hard factual evidence may vary in different periods and among different historians.

Third, there is a shift in the task of historical research and its method in turn. In addition to scrutinizing evidence like the traditionalists, postmodernists also reveal \*the process through which that evidence is used to create interpretations of past events" (p.14). To achieve this Car emphasized the usage of theories as the lens through which evidence is viewed (p.25), and their inseparable connection with evidence because evidence is what they ought to be tested against (p.25). Postmodernists not only inherit traditionalists' method of "choice and selection on evidence", but also "balanced theory and evidence" equally (p.19).

Overall the author has acclaimed the significance of Carr and other postmodernists' view on history. They have broken the monopoly of traditionalists on the topic of what history is and how it is approached, raising new possibilities of explaining past events and drawing attention to the complexity and uncertainty to historical research; and on a larger scale this heated debate is beneficial to the development of history as an academic discipline.
