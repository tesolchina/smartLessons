Throughout more than a century of outstanding progress in linguisticsand cspccially from thc timc of the Junggramnatiker-the nost impressive and apparently most abiding successes have been in work at the elemental end of languagc structure: the description and relation of phonological units.Nor, when they were presscd into reluctant scrvicc, did the categories and insights evolved for phonology get us far in cxplicating linguistic organization at othcr lcvels, thc morphological and syntactic. Moreover, even in thc fruitful renaissance of syntactic studics during thc third quarter of this ccntury, work has been virtually confincd to rclations within the sentcncc. This limitation, though to some extent vigorously defended on thcorctical grounds, has not in gcncral been because no relevance to linguistic structurc was seen in the relations between sentences, in the conncctions which resulted in the impression of well-formed paragraphs or longcr stretches of discoursc.But as with semantics-anothcr and indeed closely related area which linguists have hesitated to entcr, often justifying their dissociation on closcly-argued thcoretical grounds-- it was not unreasonably held that relations'bcyond thc sentence'involved a complex interplay of linguistics with othcr concerns such as rhctoric, acsthctics, and pragmatics, for which the theorctical foundations and framework were too shaky to support ambitious model building.And that in any case linguists had cnough on hand to get their sentential housc furnished.

Meanwhilc, literary critics (for whom of course tcxt structure has been a traditional concern) and social anthropologists (for whom text and talc constitute fundamental evidence) began thcmsclves to look at the constructs cvolved by de Saussure, the Prague School,and other linguists. One thinks for example of Levi-Strauss, Dell Hymes,Roland Barthes,as outstanding exponents of structuralism in broad-scale textual analysis.And among linguists, there have always bccn those who have persisted in the venturc to subservc literary and other humanistic disciplincs by cxtending their work to embracc stylistics and othcr aspccts of textual studics.In this movement,Michacl Halliday and Ruqaiya Hasan have long becn cspecially active. Thc prose of Golding and thc verse of Yeats are among thc material subjected to valued linguistic scrutiny by the former, while the latter has made cohesion'her spccial field,beginning with a doctoral dissertation at the University of Edinburgh and continuing with influential papers whilc she worked for sevcral fruitful years in the Communication Research Centre at University College London.During thc whole of this period, the two authors have worked in close cooperation and mutual influence, acutely aware of areas in English studies of profound interest for both linguists and critics but rigorously cxplored to a large cxtent by ncithcr.

We are singularly fortunate that wc arc able to corrcct some of thesc grave deficicncies in the description of English with the work of so uniqucly equipped a team.As English has increasingly come into world-wide usc, there has arisen a corrcspondingly increasing nccd for more information on the language and the ways in which it is used. The English Language Series seeks to mect this need and to play a part in further stimulating thc study and teaching of English by providing up-to-date and scholarly trcatments of topics most relevant to present-day English-including its history and traditions, its sound patterns,its grammar,its lexicology,its rich variety and complexity in specch and writing, and its standards in Britain, the USA, and the othcr principal areas whcre the language is used.

RANDOLPH QUIRK

This book originated as one of a scries of studics of the English language and modern English texts which wcrc undertaken by the Nuffield Progranme in Linguistics and English Teaching at University Collcge London. The aim of these studies was to provide an account of aspects of contemporary English which would bc both foundcd on theory and also applicablc in practicc: a description of the system, but one which,since it was based on evidence from texts of differcnt varietics,including both spokcn and written, would be uscful in application to furthcr text studies.

A relatively neglected aspect of the linguistic system is its resources for tcxt construction, the range of meanings that arc spccifically associated with relating what is being said.or written to its semantic environment. The principal component of these resources is that of cohesion. Cohcsive relations are rclations betwecn two or more elements in a text that are independent of the structurc; for cxamplc between a pcrsonal pronoun and an antecedent propcr name, such as John ... he. A semantic relation of this kind may be set up cither within a sentencc or between scntences; with thc consequcnce that, whcn it crosses a scntence boundary,it has the effect of making the two sentenccs cohere with one another. The various kinds of cohcsion had becn outlincd by M.A.K. Halliday in his writings on stylistics, and the conccpt was devcloped by Ruqaiya Hasan in her University of Edinburgh doctoral thcsis.

The earlier chapters of this book were first published as Granuatical Cohesion in Spoken and Written English, Part I,by Ruqaiya HasanCommunication Research Centre (University Collcgc London) and Longmans,Green & Co,Programne in Linguistics and English Teaching:Papers, No.71968.This contained Chapters 1,2 and 3 in thcir original forn.The later chaptcrs were written in collaboration by Ruqaiya Hasan and M.A.K.Halliday, and werc prcpared for publication in thc follow-up serics (Schools Council Progranne in Linguistics and English Teaching:Papers

Series II).However, instcad of issuing this part scparately,it was decided to revise thc carlier chaptcrs and to publish the two halves together as a book.Thc rcvision was undcrtaken by M.A.K.Halliday, who also added the last two chapters.

We should likc to cxpress our gratitude to scveral individuals and institutions for their coopcration and help. The Nufficld Foundation financed thc original project within which thc earlier part of thc work was written. The Schools Council financed the succcssor project (Schools Council Programme in Linguistics and English Teaching 1967-71);although thc later part was not written directly under their auspices, since Ruqaiya Hasan had by then left thc team, it had been planncd to publish it in the series of papers emanating from this project, and we are grateful to them for allowing it to bc withdrawn and published in its present rcvised form.The final version was written by M.A.K.Halliday during his tcnure of a fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Scienccs, Stanford, California, and we are most grateful to the Center for providing this opportunity.

We wish to thank Stephen Lushington, Gcncral Editor of the Schools Council Programme in Linguistics and English Teaching:Papers Series II,and a formcr collcague in the project, for his valuable help and comments throughout the preparation of thc original manuscript.Other members of the Nuffield team -Kcnneth Albrow, Eirian Davics, Peter Doughty, David Mackay and Brian Thompson-provided stimulating discussion, as did our colleagues on another related research project, Rodney HuddlestonRichard Hudson and Eugene Winter.To Marcia Insel we express our appreciation for her rcsearch and bibliographical assistance during the final revision.Students at thc Linguistic Socicty of America's Linguistic Institute, at the University of MichiganAnn Arbor,in summer 1973,made numerous helpful observations in thc context of a course based on this material.

We much appreciate the interest shown by Randolph Quirk, fricnd, formcr colleaguc, and Gencral Editor of the present scries; and would likc to take this opportunity of rcfcrring to the debt owcd by cveryone in thc field of contemporary English to the work done by him and by his colleagues at the Survey of English Usagc.Finally we thank the many peoplc who have kindly cnquired after the progress of the book.Their continuing concern has been a most valuable source of encouragement.

# Introduction

# 1.1 The concept of cohesion

1.1.1 Text

If a spcaker of English hcars or reads a passage of the language which is more than one sentence in length, he can normally dccide without difficulty whether it forms a unificd whole or is just a collection of unrelated sentences.This book is about what makes thc diffcrence betwecn the two.

The wordrex t is used in linguistics to refer to.any passage.spokcn or. written.of whatcvcr length,that docs form a unificd whole.We know,as a gcneral rulc, whether any spccimcn of our own language constitutes a TExr or not.This docs not mean there can never bc any uncertainty.Thc distinction betwcen a text and a collcction of unrelatcd sentences is in the last rcsort a mattcr of degree, and thcre may always bc instances about which we are unccrtain-a point that is probably familiar to most teachers from reading thcir students compositions.But this does not invalidate the general observation that we are sensitive to the distinction between what is text and what is not.

This suggests that there are objective factors involved-thcre must be certain features which arc characteristic of texts and not found othcrwise; and so there are. We shall attempt to identify these,in order to establish what are the propertics of texts in English, and what it is that distinguishes a tcxt from a disconnectcd sequence of sentences.As always in linguistic description, we shall be discussing things that the native speaker of thc language'knows'already-but without knowing that he knows thcm.

A text may be spoken or writtcnprose or vcrscdialogue or monologuc. It may bc anything from a singlc proverb to a wholc play,from a momcntary cry for hclp to an all-day discussion on a committee.

A tcxt is a unit of language in use. It is not a grammatical unit,like a clausc or a sentencc;and it is not defined by its size.A tcxt is somctimes envisaged to be some kind of super-sentence, a grammatical unit that is larger than a scntence but is related to a sentence in the same way that a sentencc is rclated to a clause, a clause to a group and so on: by coNsTIruency, the composition of larger units out of smaller oncs.But this is mislcading.A text is not something that is like a sentence, only bigger; it is something that differs from a sentence in kind.

A tcxt is best regarded as a sEMANTIc unit: a unit not of form but of meaning.Thus it is relatcd to a clause or sentence not by sizc but by REALIzATIoN,the coding of one symbolic system in another.A tcxt does not CONsisT OF sentences;it is REALIzED BY, Or encoded in, sentences. If we understand it in this way, we shall not expect to find thc samc kind of sTrucruRAL integration among thc parts of a text as wc find among the parts of a sentence or clause.Thc unity of a text is a unity of a different kind.

# 1.1.2 Texture

Thc concept of rex r uRe is entirely appropriate to express the property of being a text.A text has texture, and this is what distinguishes it from something that is not a text. It derives this texture from the fact that it functions as a unity with rcspcct to its environment.

What we are investigating in this book are the resources that English has for creating texture. If a passage of English containing more than one sentence is perccived as a text, there will be certain linguistic features present in that passage which can be identified as contributing to its total unity and giving it texture.

Let us start with a simple and trivial examplc.Suppose wc find the following instructions in the cookery book:

[1:1] Wash and corc six cooking applcs.Put thcm into a fireproof dish.

It is clear that them in thc sccond scntence refers back to is ANApnoRic to the six cooking apples in the first sentcnce.This ANAPHORIc function of them givcs cohesion to the two sentences,so that wc interpret them as.a whole;thc two sentences together constitute a text.Or rather,they form part of thc same textthere may be more ofit to follow.

The tcxturc is provided by the cohesive REI A TION that exists between them and six cooking apples. It is important to make this pointbecause we shall be constantly focusing attention on the items,such as them which typically refer back to somcthing that has gone beforebut thc/cohesion is effectcd not by the prcscncc of thc referring item alone but by the presence of both thc rcferring item and thc itcm that it rcfers to.In other words,it is not enough that there should be a prcsupposition the prcsupposition must also be satisficd.This accounts for thc humorous effect produced by the radio comedian who began his act with the sentence

[1:2 So we pushed him under the other one.

This scntence is loadcd with presuppositions,located in the words so,him, other and oneandsincc it was the opening scntence,nonc of them could be resolved.

What is thc MEANInG of the cohcsive relation between tlem and six cocking apples? The meaning is that thcy refer to thc same thing.Thc two itcms arc identical in rcference or cOREFE RE NTIAL.Thc cohesive agcncy in this instance,that which provides the texture,is the corcfcrentiality of them and six cooking apples.The signal,or the cxprcssion, of this coreferentiality is thc presence of the potentially anaphoric itcm then in thc second sentence together with a potential target item six cooking apples in thc first. Idcntity of rcfercnceis not the only mcaning relation that contributes to texturcthere arc others besides.Nor is the use of a pronoun the only way of exprcssing identity of reference.We could have had:

[1:3] Wash and core six cooking apples.Put thc apples into a fircproof dish.

Hcrc the item functioning cohesively is the apples, which works by repetition of the word apples accompanied by the as an anaphoric signaf.Onc of the functions of thd definite article is to signal identity of referencc with something that has gone before (Sincc this has somctimes been said to bc its only function we should perhaps point out that it has others as well, which are not cohesive at all; for examplc none of the instanccs in a) orb) has an anaphoric sense:

[1:4 a.None but thc brave deserve thc fair. b.The pain in my head cannot stiflc the pain in my heart.

For the mcaning of the,see 2.4.2 below.

# 1.1.3 Ties

We need a term to refer to a single instance of cohesion, a term for one occurrence of a pair of cohesivcly relatcd items.This we shall call a T1E.The rclation between then and six cooking apples in example [1:1 constitutes a tic.

We can charactcrize any segment of a text in terms of the numbcr and kinds of tics which it displays. In [1:1] there is just one tie, of the particular kind which we shall be calling REFERENCEChaptcr 2).In [1:3],thcre arc actually two tics,of which onc is of the referencckind,and consists in the anaphoric relation of the to six cooking apples, whilc the othcr is of a different kind and consists in the RepriTion of thc word apples, a repetition which would still have a cohesive effect cven if the two were not refcrring to the samc apples. This latter type of cohesion is discussed in Chapter 6.

The concept of a tie makes it possible to analyse a text in terms of its cohesive properties,and give a systematic account ofits patterns of texture. Some specimen analyses are given in Chapter-8.Various typcs of question can be investigated in this way,for cxample concerning thc difference between speech and writing the relationship between cohesion and the organization of written texts into sentences and paragraphs, and the possible differcnces among different genres and different authors in the numbers and kinds of tie they typically employ.

The different kinds of cohesive tie provide the main chapter divisions of the book. They are: reference, substitution,ellipsis, conjunction, and lexical cohesion.A preliminary definition of these categories is given later in the Introduction1.2.4); each of thcse concepts is then discussed more fully in the chapter in question.

# 1.1.4 Cohesion

The concept of cohesion is a scmantic one; it refers to relations of meaning that exist within thc tcxt and that dcfinc it as a text.

Cohesion bccurs where the INTERPRETATiON of some element in the discourse is dependent on that of another.The one pResupposes the other,in thc sense that it cannot be effectively decoded except by recourse to it. When this happens, a relation of cohesion is set up,and the two elements, the presupposing and the presupposed,are thereby at lcast potentially integrated into a text.

This is another way of approaching thc notion of a tic. To rcturn to example [1 : 1], the word them prcsupposes for its interpretation something other than itsclf.This requirement is met by the six cooking apples in the preceding sentence. Thc presupposition, and the fact that it is rcsolved, provide cohesion betwcen the two sentences, and in so doing creatc text.

As another example, consider the old piece of schoolboy humour:

[1:5] Time flies. -You can'tthcy fly too quickly.

The first scntencc gives no indication of not bcing a complctc text; in fact it usually is,and the humour lics in the misintcrprctation that is rcquired if the presupposition from the sccond sentence is to bc satisfied.Hcrc, incidentally the cohesion is expressed in no less than thrce ties: thc clliptical form you can't (Chapter 4),the referencc item they Chapter 2) and the lexical rcpctition fly (Chaptcr 6).

Cohesion is part of the system of a languagc.The potential for cohesion lics in the systematic resources ofrefcrcnce, cllipsis and so on that are built into the languagc itsclf. The actualization of cohcsion in any given instance,however, depends not merely on the selcction of somc option from within these rcsources,but also on the presencc of some othcr clement which resolves the presupposition that this scts up. It is obvious that thc selection of the word apples has no cohesive force by itself; a cohesive relation is sct up only if the same word, or a word related to it such as fruit see Chaptcr 6), has occurred previously. It is less obvious, but equally true, that thc word then has no cohesive force either unless thcre is some explicit rcfcrent for it within rcach. In both instanccs, the cohcsion lics in the relation that is sct up betwccn the two.

Like othcr semantic rclations, cohesion is expressed through the stratal organization of language.Languagc can be cxplained as a multiple coding system comprising three levcls of coding, orstrata': thc semantic meanings), the lexicogrammatical (forms and the_phonological and orthographic expressions).Mcanings are rcalizcd coded) as forms, and forms are realized in turn (recoded) as cxprcssions. To put this in everyday terminology, meaning is put into wording,and wording into sound or writing:

meaning (the semantic system) wording (thc lexicogrammatical system, grammar and vocabulary) 'sounding'/writing (the phonological and orthographic systems)

The popular term'wording'refcrs to lexicogrammatical form,the choice of words andgrammatical structures.Within this stratum, there is no hard-and-fast division between vocabulary and grammar; the guiding principle in language is that the more gencral mcanings are expressed through thc grammar, and the morc specific mcanings through the vocabulary.Cohcsive rclations fit into the same overall pattern.Cohesion is expressed partly through the grammar and partly through thc vocabulary.

Wc can refer thercfore to GRAMMATICAL COHESION and LEXICAL cOHesion.In example [1:3],onc of the tics was grammatical refcrence, expressed by the, the other lexical (reiteration, expressed by apples.The types of cohesion dealt with in Chaptcrs 2-4_referencc, substitution and ellipsisarc grammatical; that in Chaptcr 6 is lexical. That dcalt with in Chapter 5 (conjunction) is on the borderlinc of thc two; mainly grammatical, but with a lexical component in it. The distinction between grammatical and lexical is rcally only onc of degrce, and wc need not make too much of it hcre.It is important to stress, however, that when we talk of cohesion as bcing grammatical or lexical', we do not imply that it is a purely formal rclation, in which meaning is not involved. Cohesion is a scmantic relation.But, like all components of the semantic system it is realizcd through thc lcxicogrammatical system; and it is at this point that the distinction can be drawn.Some forms of cohcsion are realized through the grammar and others through the vocabulary.

We might add as a footnote here that certain types of grammatical cohesion are in thcir turn expressed through the intonation system, in spoken English.For examplc,in

[1:6] Did I hurt your feclings?I didn't mean to.

the sccond sentence coheres not only by ellipsis, with I didnt mean to presupposing hurt your feelings, but also by conjunction, thc adversativc mcaning 'but'being cxpressed by the tone.Phonologically this would bc:

$j _ { j }$ .2.didI/hurt yOur/EELINGs//4I/didn't/MEAN/to/ the sccond sentence having the rising-falling tonc $^ 4$ For an explanation of the intonation system, see scction 5.4 and thc rcfcrcnccs cited there.

# 1.2Cohesion and linguistic structure

# 1.2.1Texture and structure

A text as we have said,is not a structural unit and cohesion, in thc scnse in which we are using the term,is not a structural relation.Whatever relation there is among the parts of a text- the scntences, or paragraphs,or turns in a dialoguc-it is not the same as structurc in thc usual scnse, the rclation which links the parts of a scntencc or a clause.

Structure is, of coursc a unifying relation.Thc parts of a scntencc or a clause obviouslycohcrc'with cach other,by virtuc of thc structure.Hence thcy also display texture;the elcments of any structure have,by definition, an internal unity which ensures that they all cxpress part of a tcxt. One cannot changc text in mid-sentence, so to speak; or rather, if one does, therc will always be a brcak in the structure, with something being intcrpolated which is not structurally a part of the same sentence, as in Hamlct's [1:7] Then I will come to my mother by and by - they fool me to the top of my bent - I will come by and by.

or, morc conversationally,

[1: 8] .. But what I want to know is - yes, some icc, please - what this government think thcy're doing when they spend all that moncy on building new schools. What's wrong with the old ones?

In gencral, any unit which is structured hangs together so as to form text. All grammatical units - sentenccs, clauscs, groups, words - are intenally cohcsive'simply becausc thcy are structured. The same_applies to the phonological units, the tone group,foot and syllable.Structure is one means of expressing texture.

If every text consisted of only one sentence, we should not need to go beyond the catcgory of structure to explain the internal cohesiveness of a text: this could be explaincd simply as a function ofits structure.But tcxts arc usually not limited to one sentence; on the contrary, texts consisting of onc sentence only arc fairly rare.Thcy do exist; thcre are public notices, proverbs, advertising slogans and thc like, whcrc one sentencc by itself comprises a complcte text, for example

[19] a. No smoking. b.Wonders ncver cease! c. Read The Herald every day.

But nost texts extend well beyond the confines of a single scntencc.

In other words, a text typically extends beyond the rangc of structural rclations, as these arc normally conccived of. But texts cohcrc; so cohesion within a text - texture-depends on something othcr than structure. Therc are certain spccifically text-forming relations which cannot be accounted for in tcrms of constituent structurc; they are properties of the text as such, and not of any structural unit such as a clause or sentence.Our usc of the term cohesion refers specifically to these non-structural text-forming relations.They are, as we have suggested,semantic relations, and thc text is a semantic unit.

# 1.2.2 Cohesion within the sentence?

Sincc cohesive relations are not concerned with structure, they may bc found just as well within a sentence as between sentences. They atract less notice within a sentence, becausc of the cohesive strength of grammatical structure; sincc the sentence hangs together already, the cohcsion is not necded in order to makc it hang together. But thc cohesive rclations are thcre all thc same. For cxample

[1: 10] If you happcn to meet the admiral, don't tell him his ship's gonc down.

Herc the him and his in the second half have to be dccoded by reference to the admiral, just as thcy would have had to be if thcre had becn a scntence boundary in between.Similarly:

[1:11] Mary promised to send a picture of thc children,but she hasn't donc.

Here done equals sent a picture of the children, and it is quite irrclevant to this whether the two are in the same scntence or not.

Cohesive relations have in principle nothing to do with sentencc boundaries. Cohesion is a semantic relation bctwcen an clement in the text and some other elemcnt that is crucial to the interprctation of it. This other element is also to be found in the text f 1.2.4 below)but its location in the text is in no way determined by the grammatical structure.The two elements, the presupposing and the presupposed, may be structurally rclated to each other, or they may not; it makes no difference to thc mcaning of the cohesive relation.

Howevcr, there is a sensc in which thc sentencc is a significant unit for cohcsion prccisely because it is the highest unit of grammatical structure: it tends to determine the way in which cohcsion is ExpResseD.For examplc, if the samc entity is referred to twice within the same sentence, there arc rules governing the form of its realization.These arc thc rules of pronominalization. It is the sentence structure which dctermincs, within limits,whcther at thc second mention the cntity will bc naned again or will be referrcd to by a pronoun.For example, wc cannot say

[1:12] John took John's hat off and hung John's hat on a peg.

Assuming that there is only one John'herc, and only one hatthen this idcntity of reference must bc expressed by the use of prononinal forms: John took his hat off and hung it on a peg.

This sort of thing can be accountcd for by reference to scntence structure; the relation betwcen an item and another one that prcsupposes it could bc explaincd as a structural rclation. In the preceding scntcncc, for example, the words one and it bothin diffcrent ways,presuppose thc word iten; and this presupposition could be incorporated into the structure of the sentence.

But this would be misleading. Only certain instances of cohesion could be treated structurally, and only when the two items, the presupposing and the presupposed, happened to occur within the same sentence.But, as we have secn, the qucstion whcther the two fall within the same sentence or not is irrclevant to thc nature of thc cohesive relation; cohcsion is a morc general notion, and onc that is above considcrations of structure. Morcover only certain kinds of cohesive relation are governed by such rules; mainly those involving identity of referencc, which under ccrtain conditions must be signalled by a refcrence item (Chapter 2).Cohcsion that is expresscd through substitution and ellipsis (Chapters 3 and 4) is unaffected by the sentence structure; and so is lexical cohcsion (Chapter 6). In the case of conjunction (Chapter s),there arc special forms to cxpress the various conjunctive relations whcre these are associated with grammatical structure;compare [1:13a],which is non-structural, with its structural counterpart [1:13b]:

[1:13] a. It's raining.-Then let's stay at home. b.Since it's raining, let's stay at home.

Regardless of the presence or absence of a structural link, the semantic relation that provides cohesion, namely that of cause, is thc same in both.

For these reasons cohesion within thc sentence nced not be regarded as essentially a distinct phenomenon.Cohcsion is a gcneral text-forming relation,or sct of such rclations, ccrtain of which, when incorporated within a sentencc structure, are subject to ccrtain restrictions-no doubt bccausc the grammatical condition ofbeing a sentence'cnsurcs that the parts go together to form a tcxt anyway.But the cohesive relations themselves arc the samc whcther thcir elements are within the same scntence or not.

As a gcncral rule, the examples cited in this book will be of cohesion across scntence boundaries, since hcre the cffect is more striking and the meaning is more obvious: cohesivc ties betwecn sentcnces stand out more clcarly because thcy arc the ONly source of texture, whercas within the scntence thcre are the structural relations as well. In the description of a text, it is thc intersentence cohesion that is significant, because that represents the variable aspect of cohesion, distinguishing one text from another. But this should not obscure the fact that cohesion is not, strictly speaking, a relation above the sentence'. It is a relation to which thc sentence, or any other form of grammatical structure, is simply irrelevant.

# 1.2.3 Cohesion and discourse structure

It will bc clcar from what has becn said above that cohcsion is not just another name for discourse structure.Discoursc structurc is as_thc name implics a type of structure;thc term is used to refer to the structure of some postulated unit higher than the sentence, for cxample the paragraph, or some larger entity such as episode or topic unit.

The concept of cohcsion is set up to account for relations in discourse, but in rather a different way,without thc implication that there is some structural unit that is above the scntencc. Cohesion refers to thc range of possibilitics that exist for linking something with what has gonc before. Sincc this linking is achieved through relations in MEANinG we are excluding from consideration thc cffects of formal devices such as syntactic paral!elism, mctre and rhyme), what is in qucstion is the set of nicaning relations which function in this way: the semantic resources which are drawn on for the purpose of creating text. And since, as we have stressed, it is the sentence that is thc pivotal entity here- whatever is put togcther within one sentence is ipso facto part of a text-we can interprct cohesion, in practice, as thc sct of semantic resources for linking a sEnrence with what has gone bcfore.

This is not to rule out the possibility of setting up discourse structures, and specifying the structure of some entity such as a paragraph or topic unit. It is clear that there is structure here, at least in certain genres or registcrs of discourse.But it is doubtful whether it is possible to demonstratc generalized structural relationships into which sentences enter as the realization of functions in some higher unit, as can be done for all units bclow the sentence.The type of rclation into which sentenccs enter with cach other diffcrs from that which holds among the part or sub-parts of a sentencc.We cannot show,for examplc, that there is any functional relation between the two scntcnces of [1:1] above,such that the two form a configuration of mutually defining structural roles.(It may on the other hand be possible to show something of the kind precisely by invoking the concept of cohcsion; $c f$ Chapter 5.)Whereas within thc sentence, or any similar unit, wc can specify a limited number of possiblc structures,such as types of modification or subordination, transitivity or modal structurcs and the like, which dcfine thc relations among the parts, we cannot in thc same way list a sct of possible structures for a text, with sentence classcs to fill the structural roles.Instcad we have to show how sentences, which are structurally indcpcndent of one another, may bc linked together through particular featurcs of thcir intcrpretation; and it is for this that the concept of cohesion is required.

# 1.2.4 Cohesion as a semantic relation

To say that two sentences cohere by virtue of relations in their meaning is not by itsclf very precisc.Practically any two sentences might be shown to have something to do with cach othcr as far as their meaning is concerned; and although in judging whether there is tcxturc or not wc certainly have recourse to some feeling about how much the sentcnces do actually intcrrclatc in meaning,we could not give any very explicit account of the degrcc of relatedness that is needed or how it is to be measured.

But thcrc is one spccific kind of meaning relation that is critical for the creatiOn Of tcxturc: that in which ONE ELEMENT IS INTERPRETED BY REFERENCE TO ANoTHER.What cohcsion has to do with is the way in which the meaning of the elemcnts is interprcted.Whcrc thc interpretation of any item in the discourse requires making reference to somc othcr itcm in the discourse, there is cohesion.

Consider the example [114] He said so.

This sentcnce is perfectly intclligible as it stands; we know what it means, in the sense that we can 'decodc' it senantically.But it is UNInTeRPRETABle because we do not know who he'is or what he said. For this we have to refer elsewhere, to its contextin the sense of what has gone before.

Now it is also true that, given just the sentence [1: 15] John said everything.

wc do not know who John' is,or what he said, eithcr.But thcrc is an important differencc bctween examplcs [1:14] and [1:15].In [1:14],the items he and so contain in their meaning an cxplicit signal that the mcans of their interpretation is available somcwhere in thc cnvironment. Hearing or reading this sentence, we know that it links up with some other passage in which thcre is an indication of who he'is and what he said.This is not the case with John or everything, neither of which necessarily presupposes any such source of further interpretation.

We now come to thc more complex part of the picture. It is easy cnough to show that he and so are cohesive; thcre is no mcans of interpreting them in their own right, and we arc immcdiately aware of the need to recover an interpretation from elsewhcrc. There are systematically related questions which cxpress this Who said so? What did he say?By the same token we can readily rccognize the cohesive effect of a sentence such as:

[1:16 Lying on the floor.

Herc therc is no cxplicit signal of presupposition, in the form of a word like / or so; the cohcsion is provided by what is Ieft out and again we can ask the rclevant qucstion Who is? Notice however that there is now some ambiguity as regards the information to be supplicd; the actual text might have been

[1:17]What was John doing whcn you came in? Lying on the floor.

in which case lying would have to be interpreted as was lying not is lying And there are still further possibilitics as illustrated by:

[118] What is your favourite pastime? Lying on the floor.

These show that cohcsion is a relational concept; it is not the presence of a particular class of item that is cohesive, but the relation between one item and another.

This point emcrges very clearly with another type of cohesion,which would otherwise bc difficult to explain. We said with refcrence to example [1:1s] that therc is nothing presupposing about the item John; the sentence John said everything does not in itself confer thc automatic right to ask for an interpretation of John, as he said everything docs with regard to he. But we may have a sequence such as:

1:19 I was introduced to them it was John Leathwall and his wife.I had nevcr met John before, but I had heard a lot about him and had somc idea what to expect.

Here Joln does havc a cohesive function -because it is reiterated. This form of cohesion is lexical Chaptcr 6):it consists in selecting the same lexical itcm twice, or selecting two that are closely rclated.The two instances may or may not have the same referent;but thc interpretation of the second will be referable in some way to that of the first.Comparc what was said about exanple [1:3] above.Another cxample would be:

[1:2o Jan sat down to rest at the foot ofa huge beech-trec.Now hc was so tired that hc soon fell asleep;and a leaf fell on him and then another, and then another, and bcfore long he was covcrcd all over with leaves, ycllow, golden and brown.

Here leaf ties with beech-tree.The two are clcarly not identical in reference, since tree and leaf are not synonymous; but the intcrpretation of leaf depcnds on beech-tree-wc know'that the leaf was a bccch-lcaf, and if thc sentence had continucd before long he was covered all over with oak-leaves we should have rejected it as a mistake. This illustrates the force of cohesion; and it also illustrates the fact that cohesion depends not on the presence of explicitly anaphoric items like so and he, but on the establishment of a semantic relation which may takc any onc of.various forms.

Onc other form it may take is that of conjunction,expressed by means of itcms such as but later onin that case Chapter 5).Hcrc thc cohesion resides in an abstract relation between one proposition and another. This may be a matter of the conrrnr of the propositions, how they are related to each othcr as phenomcna; for example

[1:21] First, he took a picce of string and tied it carcfully round the neck of the bottle.Next, he passed the other end over a branch and weighted it down with a stone.

Or it may be a matter of their role in thc discourse, how they are related in the perspectivc of the speaker or writcr, for cxample

[1:22] Firsthc has no experience of this kind of work.Next hc showed no sign of being willing to learn.

Here next refers to succession in thc argument, not to any sequence of events in time. A very large number of different words and phrases occur as expressions of conjunction; but they all fall into a few sets representing very gcncral typcs of logical relation.

Thus thc concept of cohesion accounts for thc cssential semantic relations whercby any passage of speech or writing is cnabled to function as tcxt. We can systcmatize this concept by classifying it into a small number of distinct catcgories -reference,substitutionellipsisconjunctionand lexical cohesion;categories which have a theoretical basis as distinct types of cohesive rclation, but which also provide a practical means for describing and analysing texts.Each of thesc categories is represented in thc tcxt by particular features - rcpctitions, omissions, occurrences of certain words and constructions - which have in common the property of signalling that thc interpretation of the passage in question depends on something elsc. If that something else'is verbally explicit, then there is cohesion.There are,of course,othcr types of semantic relation associatcd with a text which are not cmbodicd in this concept; but the one that it does cmbody is in some ways the most important, since it is common to text of every kind and is in fact, what makes a text a text.

# 1.3 Cohesion and linguistic context

1.3.1 The donain of cohesive relations

The simplest form of cohcsion is that in which the presupposed element is verbally cxplicit and is found in the immediatcly prcceding sentence; for example

[1:23] Did the gardener water my hydrangeas? -He said so.

We shall treat this as the norm for purposes of illustration and discussion; not only because it is simpler in practice but also bccause it is, as we have suggested,the paradigm case of cohcsion from a thcoretical point of view, sincc thc boundary betwecn two sentences represents a mininal break in structural continuity.

There are two kinds of departure from this norm. First, the presupposed clement may be locatcd elsewhere, in an earlier sentence, perhaps, or in the following one; secondly, it may not be found in the text at all. Let us consider these in turn.

Cohesion-as we havc said is not a structural relation; hence it is unrestricted by sentence boundaries, and in its most normal form it is simply the presupposition of something that has gone before,whethcr in the preceding sentence or not.This form of presupposition, pointing BAck to some previous itcm,is known as ANAPHORA.What is presupposed anaphorically may be in the sentencc immediately prcccding,but it may also be in some earlier sentence; in thc following examplc, he refers back to Henry:

[1:24] The first years of Henry's reign, as recorded by the admiring Hall, were given over to sport and gaiety, though there was little of the liccntiousness which charactcrized the French Court. The athletic contcsts were serious but very popular.Masques,jousts and spectacles followed one anothcr in endless pageantry.He brought to Greenwich a tremcndously vital court life,a central importance in the country's affairs and, above all, a great naval connection.\*

Or it may be the whole of some longer passage; here the sch presupposes everything that preccdes:

1:2s Travelling with huge retinues of staff and scrvants, medieval monarchs demanded a scrics of houses to take carc of their needs.

Thcir requirements were large. Government went where they wcnt-(it was still the King's government)-with all its attendant staff and visitors.They were responsiblc for a largc numbcr of followers, and visitors had to be entertained in stylc. Thcy were cxpected to dispense patronage and to entertain on a lavish scalc.During thc wintcr festival of Christmas, lasting twenty days, they noninally kept open house. Richard II, notoriously prodigal, entertained over ten thousand cvery day at his palaccs, and even more over Christmas.

No single home could possibly cope with the organization and material products nceded on such a scale.\*

As might be expected, the tendency is different with diffcrcnt typcs of cohesion.Where thc cohesive element is something like he or one, which cohercs by direct refcrence to, or substitution for another item, the presupposed clcmcnt is typically a specific itcm in the immcdiately preceding sentence.This is the most usual pattern in thc casc of refcrcnce and substitution.Characteristically these intances also tend to form coHesivE CHAins, sequences in which it,for example,refers back to thc immcdiatcly prcceding scntcncc-but to another it in that sentence, and it is necessary to go back thrcc, four or more sentences, stepping across a whole sequence of its, before finding the substantial element.An example of this is 1:25 above, which has a cohesivc chain medieval monarchs...their.. they...they...they...they,leading finally to Richard $\varPi$ as a specific instance of a medieval monarch. Here is another example in which threc such cohesive chains intertwine,initiated by Short Johnson over Jordan and Johnson:

[1:26] Short places Jolnson over Jordan squarely in the tradition of expressionist drama.He says that Johnson is atypical Briton, an'English Everyman'.He regards thc play as an imaginativc presentation of the mind of a man who has just dicd.But, he adds, Pricstley is more interested in Johnson living than in Johnson dead. In this thc play is cxpressionist in its approach to themc. But it is also so in its usc of unfamiliar devices-thc use of masks, the rejection of the thrcc or four act lay-out of the plot. And, finally, he points to the way in which Johnson moves quite frecly in and out of chronological time.

It may be helpful to tabulatc the ties forming thcse three chains:

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>(i) Short</td><td>(ii) Johnson over Jordan</td><td>(ii) Johnson</td></tr><tr><td>Sentence 1:</td><td>Short</td><td>Johnson over Jordan</td><td>Johnson (in J over J)</td></tr><tr><td>Sentence 2:</td><td>he</td><td></td><td>Johnson</td></tr><tr><td>Sentence 3:</td><td>he</td><td>the play</td><td>a man who has just died</td></tr><tr><td>Sentence 4:</td><td>he</td><td></td><td>Johnson2x</td></tr><tr><td>Sentence 5:</td><td></td><td>theplay...its</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sentence 6:</td><td></td><td>it...its</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Sentence 7:</td><td>he</td><td></td><td>Johnson</td></tr></table></body></html>

Whcrc the cohesion_takes the form of conjunction, with expressions like but soin that caselater onthe presupposition typically involves a passage longer than a single sentence.This hardly needs illustrating,but here is one example, a passage of Carlyle in which the conjunction on the other hand clearly rclates to the whole of the preccding paragraph:

[1:27] How much is still alive in England how much has not yet come into life! A Feudal Aristocracy is still alive, in the prime of life superintending thc cultivation of the land, and less consciously the distribution of the produce of the land, the adjustment of the quarrels of the land; judging, soldiering, adjustingeverywherc governing the people,- so that even a Gurth, born thrall of Cedric lacks not his due parings of the pigs he tends. Governing- and,alas also game-preservingso that a Robin Hooda William Scarlet and others have, in these days, put on Lincoln coats, and taken to living,in somc universal-suffragc manner, under the greenwood tree!

How silent, on the other hand, lic all Cotton-tradcs and such like; not a stceple-chimney yet got on end fron sea to sea!

Lcxical cohesion differs again, in that it rcgularly lcaps over a number of scntcnces to pick up an element that has not figured in the intervening text:

[1:28] I screamed, and my scream went wafting out on thc night air And some ncighbours who - they were my nearest ncighbours, but thcy wcre still some distance away - came rushing along. They wcre awfully good, and thcy said afterwards they thought I'd been bcing murdered. Well, I couldn't've madc morc noise if I had becn!But I'd surprised myself-really,the sound that

went floating out on thc air I didn't know I had it in mc, and thcy said it would makc my fortunc if I scnt it to Iollywood. And I may say it surpriscd the thicf sufficicntly that hc dropped my handbag and fled.Fortunately I wasn't bet ween him and the door, so there was no harm done and I didn't lose anything. Fortunately for him, or fortunately for you?   
Oh, for me; they generally carry knives.   
-I know; somconc was murdcred in the main hotel quite rccently.   
-Oh ycs, ycs although people did say that therc were wheels within whccls in that. But you gct bctween a fleeing thief and his cxit, and he's bound to be carrying a knife.But anyhow, the only thing I lost was my voicc. I couldn't speak for a weck afterwards.

Here lost (in lost..my voice resumes the lose in didn't lose anything)thc resumption being signalled by the conjunctive item anyhow;and voice rclates back to screannoise and sound. Resumptions of this kind can span large passages of intcrvening text, especially in informal conversation.

So far we havc considered cohesion purely as an anaphoric relation, with a presupposing item presupposing something that has gone beforc it.But thc presupposition may go in the opposite direction, with thc prcsupposed element following.This we shall refer to as CA TAPHoRA.

The distinction only arises if there is an explicitly prcsupposing item prcsent, whosc rcfcrent clearly either precedes or follows. If the cohesion is lexical, with the same lexical item occurring twice over,then obviously the second occurrence must take its intcrprctation from the first;the first can never be said to point forward to thc sccond. If John follows John, there is no possiblc contrast between anaphora and cataphora.But an item such as this and here cAN point forward, deriving its interpretation from somcthing that follows, for examplc:

[r29] This is how to get the best results.You let thc berrics dry in the sun,till all the moisture has gonc out of thcm.Then you gather them up and chop them very finc.

The presupposed clcment may, and often does, consist of morc than one sentence.Where it does not, the cataphoric reference is oftcn signalled in writing with a colon: but although this has the effct of uniting the two parts into a single orthographic scntence,it docs not imply any kind of structural rclation between them.The colon is uscd solely to signal thc cataphora,this bcing one of its principal functions.

Therc rcmains onc further possibility, namely that thc information required for interpreting somc element in the text is not to bc found in the text at all, but in thc situation.For cxamplc, given

[1:30]Did the gardener water thosc plants?

it is quitc possible that those refers back to the preceding text, to some carlier mcntion of those particular plants in the discussion.But it is also possiblc that it refcrs to thc environment in which the dialogue is taking place - to thc context of situation, as it is called- where the plants in question are present and can be pointed to if necessary. The interpretation would be those plants therc, in front of us.

This type of reference we shall call ex OpHoRA-since it takcs us outside thc text altogcther.Exophoric rcference is not-cohesive, since it does not bind the two clements together into a text.One might reason that,metaphorically speaking,thc plants form part of the text;but this seems rather pointless, because there could be no significant contrast here betwecn the prcsence of cohesion and its absence - one would have to assume that, in the absence of cohcsive referencc to them the plants would have comprised a text on their own.But exophora is of interest at several points in the discussion particularly with refcrence to the definite articlc as a tcxtforming agent, and it will bc brought up whcre relevant.

The linc betwcen exophoric and anaphoric reference is not always very sharp. In dramatic dialogue, for example, thc mere presence or absence of a stage direction would change the picture, eg

[1:31] How swect thc moonlight sleeps upon this bank! Herc will we sit and lct the sound of music Creep in our ears.

If the stage directions spccify somcthing like a grassy bankthen for the readcr this and here becomc anaphoric; otherwise, thcy were exophoric. The significancc of the exophoric potential is that, in instances wherc the key to thc interpretation is not ready to hand, in text or situation, the hearer or reader.consrrucrs a contcxt of situationin order to supply it for himself. So we supply the grassy bank in our imagination, and the producer necd not put one on thc stagc. This is an cssential clement in all imaginative writing.

It may bc helpful here to draw attention to the distinction between cohesion as a rclation in the systcm, and cohcsion as a process in the text. Cohesion'is defincd as the set of possibilities that exist in the language for making text hang togethcr: thc potcntial that the speaker or writer has at his disposal. This is a purely relational concept, and directionality comes into it only if one of thc clements in thc cohesive relation is By Irs NATURE cohcsive, in that it is inhcrently pointing to'somcthing else; in this case therc is a logical dependcnce, and hence a significant opposition IN THE sysTem betwecn pointing back (anaphora) and pointing forwards cataphora).But cohesion is also a proccss, in the sense that it is the instantiation of this rclation in a text.A text unfolds in rcal time, and directionality is built into it;hence of thc two clcments cmbodying the cohesive relation, onc always follows the other.

In the system: a< >b In the text: a- >b (time) implicitly anaphoric John John2 explicitly anaphoric John :he (explicitly) cataphoric he: John

In the text it is natural for the element occurring sccond to depend for its interpretation on the one occurring first; hence, anaphora is the unmarked and cataphora is the marked tcrm in the opposition. Cataphora occurs only as an Explicir relation with thc first clcment always being one that is inherently presupposing. Thus cohesion as a process always involves one item pointing to anothcr; whereas thc significant property of the cohesive rclationas we have strcssed above, is the fact that one item provides the source for the interpretation of anothcr.

# 1.3.2 Text and situation

We should now say a little more about the nature of a text,and its relation to a contcxt of situation.Let us bcgin with an example:

[1:32] Although the light was on he went to sleep. Although the house was unfurnished the rcnt was very high.Although he was paid a high salary hc refused to stay in thc job.

These three sentences clearly have something in common; they are not just three scntences picked at random from a corpus of written English. What they have in common is a certain degrce of grammatical similarity: parallel structurcs, with repetition of the item although.They could,however,be written in any other sequence without disturbing thc organization of the passage as a whole,such as it is;whatevcr it is that gives unity to this tcxt' it docs not depend on thc order in which the sentences are arranged.

This sort of grammatical parallelism is not irrclevant to internal cohcsionit is a common fcature not only of poctry but of many other kinds of discourse as well. But by itsclf it docs not make a string of scntenccs into a text.The sentences in $[ \mathrm { I } : 3 2 ]$ could bc said to form a text, but if so it is a text of a very spccial kind:a text about language, in which the sentences are crAioN FoRMs-that is,itcms introduced for the purpose of saying something about them.A sct of citation forms that are rclated only by their grammatical parallelism is a familiar featurc of texts about language; and [1:32] is in fact taken from a textbook of Chinese for English-speaking students.Thc sentences in it, together with their Chincse equivalents, form part of a drill.

The passage illustrates, in an extreme form, a general principle concerning dccisions about what is and what is not a text. Wc do not, in fact, cvaluatc any specimen of language-and dcciding whethcr it does or docs not constitute text is a prercquisite to any further evaluation ofit-without knowing something about its context of situation. It is the context of situation of this passage,thc fact that it is part of a language textbook, that enables us to accept it as tcxt.A set of sentences that in any other environment would not constitute a tcxt is admissible as such in the restrictcd context of a book about languagc.Since the present book will be full of citation forms we need not discuss them further here; the effect of thcir occurrence in a situation to which they are inappropriate can be seen in Ionesco's play The Bald-headed Prinadonna.But thcy illustrate the gencral principle that the hearer or reader, when hc is dctcrmining,consciously or unconsciously,the status of a specimen of languagc, invokes two kinds of evidence,thc external as well as thc internal: hc uses not only linguistic clues but also situational ones. Lingustically,hc responds to spccific features which bind the passage together,the patterns of connectionindcpendent of structurc,that we arc referring to as cohcsion.Situationallyhe takes into account all he knows of the environment: what is going on what part the language is playing, and who are involved.

Thc intcrnal and thc cxternal aspects of texture' arc not wholly separable, and the reader, or listencr,does not separate thcm when responding unconsciously to a passage of speech or writing.But when the linguist sceks to makc explicit the basis on which these judgments are formed, he is bound to make observations of two rather different kinds.The one concerns relations within the language,patterns of meaning realized by grammar and vocabulary; thc other concerns the relations Berween thc language and the relevant features of the speaker's and hcarer's or writer's and rcader's) matcrial,social and idcological environment.Both thcsc aspects of a text fall within the domain of linguistics.The linguistic pattcrns, which embody, and at the samc time also impose structure on, our experience of thc cnvironment,by thc samc token also make it possiblc to identify what fcatures of thc cnvironment are relevant to linguistic behaviour and so form part of the context of situation.But therc are two sets of phenomena here, and in this book wc arc conccrned with thc LiNGuisric factors that are characteristic of texts in English.Thc situational propertics of texts, which are now bcgining to be studied in grcatcr dctail and with greatcr undcrstanding, constitute a vast field of cnquiry which lies outside our scope hcrc.Some of thc factors of most immcdiatc relevance are sunmarized in the paragraphs that follow.

Thc term situAtion, mcaning the context of situation'in which a tcxt is cmbedded,refers to all those extra-inguistic factors which have sone bcaring on thc text itself. A word of caution is necded about this concept. At the moment, as the text of this Introduction is bcing composed, it is a typical English October day in Palo AltoCalifornia a grecn hillside is visiblc outsidc thc window, the sky is grey, and it is pouring with rain.This might secm part of thc'situation'of this text;but it is not, because it has no relevance to thc mcanings expressed,or to the words or grammatical patterns that are uscd to cxpress them.The question is,what are the external factors affccting the linguistic choices that the spcakcr or writer makes.These are likcly to bc thc nature of the audiencc, thc medium, the purpose of the communication and so on. There arc types of discourse in which the state of thc weathcr would form part of the context of situation,for example, language-in-action in mountaineering or sailing;but writing a book about language is not one of them.

As a rule, the features of the situation arc rclcvant at a rather general level. That is to say, if we think of the examplc of a lccture on current affairs to an adult evening class, what matters is not that it is John Smith talking to Messrs Jones,Robinson,Brown and others on a particular Tuesday evening in Burnlcy,but that it is a lecturer addressing a gathering of adult studcnts within thc framework of a given social institution.This is not to deny either the individual characteristics of speakers or writers or the importancc of studying thc distinctivc quality of a particular author's style.It is mcrcly to emphasize that many of the features of a text can bc explained by reference to generalized situation types.

# 1.3.3 Components of the context of situationand register

The concept of coNTExT OF sIrUATiON was formulated by Malinowski in 1923, in his supplemcnt to Ogden and Richards'The Meaning of

Meaning, and subscquently claborated by Firth, particularly in a paper written in 19so called Personality and languagc in society'It has been worked over and extended by a numbcr of linguists, thc best-known treatmcnt bcing perhaps that of Hymes in Models of intcraction of language and social setting.Hymes categorizes the speech situation in terms of cight components which wc may sunmarize as: form and content of tcxtsettingparticipantsends intent and effectkcymediumgcnre and interactional norms. It will be notcd that, in this vicw of thc mattcr, the text itsclf forms part of thc specch situation.

A morc abstract intcrpretation, intendcd as a basis for Deriving thc features of the text from the fcaturcs of thc situation, had becn offered by Halliday, McIntosh and Strevens in The Linguistic Sciences and Language Teaching. Thcy had proposed the thrcc headings FIELD, Mope.and TENOR (to adopt the terminology prcferred by Spenccr and Gregory in Linguistics and Style).These are highly general concepts for describing how the context of situation detcrmines the kinds of meaning that are expressed. The FIELD isthe total cycnt, in which the text is functioning, together with the purposivc activity of thc spcaker or writcr it thus includes the subject-matter as onc element in it.The MoDEis thc function of the text in the event, including therefore both the channel takcn by the language spoken or written, extempore or preparcd - and its genre, or rhetorical mode, as narrative, didactic, pcrsuasivc, phatic communion'and so on. The TenoR refers to thc typc of rolc interaction, the set of relevant social relations, permancnt and tenporary, among the participants involved. Field, mode and tenor collectively define thc contcxt of situation of a text (see the further discussion in Halliday's Langnage and Social Man).

The linguistic features which are typically associated with a configuration of situational featurcs -with particular values of the ficld,mode and tenor-constitute a REGIsTER.Thc more specifically we can characterize thc context of situation, the more specifically we can predict the properties of a text in that situation. If we merely namc thc subjcct-mattcr, or the medium, it will tell us very little; we could talk of a register of marinc biology' or a newspaper rcgister', but this hardly enables us to say anything of interest about thc types of text in question.But if we give some information about all three catcgorics of field, modc, and tcnor, we begin to bc able to make some useful obscrvations. For instancc, if we specify a field such as personal interaction, at the cnd of thc day, with aim of inducing contentment through recounting of familiar cvents',with mode 'spoken monologue, imaginative narrativc, cxtempore' and tenor 'intimate, mother and three-ycar-old child', we can reconstruct a grcat deal of thc language of this kind of bedtime story, cspecially if we go further and describc thc CONTExT OF CULTURE (anothcr of Malinowski's concepts) which will tell us, among other things, what arc the familiar cvents in the life of a child with the given socio-cultural background. The register is thc sct of meanings,the configuration of semantic patterns, that are typically drawn upon undcr thc specified conditions, along with the words and structures that arc uscd in the realization of these mcanings.The fact that we can say of any given text, with some assurance, whcther or not it satisfies a description of the context of situation such as the one just given, shows how rcal the notion of register is.

In gencral, if a passage hangs togethcr as a text, it will display a consistency.of rcgister.In othcr words, thc texture involves more than thc presence of semantic rclations of the kind we refer to as cohcsivc, the dcpendence of one elcment on another for its interpretation. It involves also some degree of coherence in the actual meanings expressed: not only, or even mainly, in the contenr, but in the rorAL selection from the semantic resources of the language, including the various interpersonal (socialcxpressive-conative) components-thc moods,modalities,intensities,and Other forms of the speaker's intrusion into the speech situation.

The concept of coHesiON can therefore be usefully supplemented by that of REGistER,since the two.together.effectively.dcfinc a TExrA text is a passage of discourse which is coherent in these two regards: it is cohcrent with respect to the context of situation and thcrefore consistent in rcgister and it is coherent with rcspect-to-itself, and therefore cohesive. Neither of these two conditions is sufficient without the other, nor docs the one by necessity cntail thc other. Just as onc can construct passages which seem to hang together in the situational-scmantic scnse, but fail as texts because thcy lack cohesion, so also onc can construct passages which are bcautifully cohesive but which fail as texts because they lack consistency of register - there is no continuity of meaning in relation to the situation.The hearer, or rcader, reacts to both of these things in his judgment of texture.

Under normal circunstanccs, of course, we do not find oursclves faced withnon-textwhich is non-sense'of a rather csoteric kind.Texturc is a matter of degree. It is almost impossible to construct a verbal sequence which has no texturc at all-but this, in turn, is largely because wc insist on interpreting any passagc as text if thcrc is the remotest possibility of doing so.We assume, in othcr words, that this is what language is for; whatever its specific function may be in the particular instancc, it can serve this function only under the guise of text. If one can imaginc a situation in which someone is faced with a string of words pickcd at random from a dictionary but which has bccn madc to look or sound as if it was structured, thcn it is safe to prcdict that hc will go to grcat lengths to interpret it as text, and as relatcd to some accessible featurcs of the situation. The nearest wc gct to non-text in actual lifc, lcaving aside the works of those poets and prosc writers who deliberatcly set out to crcate non-tcxt, is probably in the spccch of young children and in bad translations.

Two further points arc worth making,in connection with the text and its context of situation.Onc is that the relation of tcxt to situation is very variablc, in terms of thc rclative weight which thc tcxt has to bear.Therc arc certain typcs of situation in which thc non-linguistic factors clearly dominate and the language plays an ancillary rolc: for example, a nonverbal game,like football, in which thcrc arc a fcw verbal instructions from player to player; or joint operations on objccts, building, assembling, cooking, clcaning and the like.Here it is impossiblc to interpret what is said or written without situational information;onc must know what is going on.At the other end of the scalc arc typcs of activity in which the language is the whole story, as in most formal or informal discussion on abstract themes, such as those of business, politics and intellectual life. Here the language may be totally self-sufficient and any relevant situational factors are derivable from thc language itself. Thc quality of texture, and thc forms of cohesion which provide it, differ very much as between thesc two poles.One question on which a great deal of further study is needcd is the relation betwcen tcxture and situation type: the different ways in which texts of different kinds are constructed so as to form semantic wholes.

The second point concerns what Ellis calls DeLicAcy OE FO.cs in situational analysis.We obviously cannot draw a clear line between the sanc situation'and 'different situations'; any two contexts of situation will bc alike in somc respects and not in others, and thc amount of detail needcd to charactcrize the situation will vary according to what we are intcrested in - what distinctions we are trying to make between one instance and another, what features of the text wc are trying to cxplain and so on. Questions like 'are these two texts in the same register?'arc in thcmselves meaningless; we can only ask in what respects thc texts,and the situations, arc alike and in what respects they differ.If a child turns around from talking to his fathcr and starts talking to his uncle, wc arc not called on to decide whcther the situation has changcd or not;but wc shall be intcrcsted to note whether therc are lingnistic signals of thc diffcrence in pcrsonal relationships.This affects our notion of a text.Up to now we have been discussing this on thc assumption of an all-or-nothing view of tcxture:cithcr a passagc forms tcxt, or it does not.In rcal lifc we so seldom meet non-tcxt that wc can afford to adopt such a dcterministic vicw:we are not requircd in practice to decide where a text begins and cnds.But in fact there are degrees of texture, and if we are examining language from this point of view,especially spokcn language, we shall at tines be uncertain as to whether a particular point marks a continuation of the same text or thc bcginning of a ncw one.This is bccause texture is rcally amorc-orless'affair.A partial shift n the context of situation- say a shift in one situational factor, in thc ficld of discourse or in thc mode or tcnor - is likely to be reflected in some way in the texture of the discourse,without destroying completely the continuity with what has gone before.

It is worth pointing out in this connection that continuity of subjectmattcr is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for thc creation of texturc.Subject-matter is neither morc nor less important than othcr fcatures of thc context of situation as a determinant of text; it is simply one of the factors that cnters into the picture.And where there is continuity of subject-matter within a text, as we typically find it, the texture is not necessarily the result of this $;$ the following example is about mathematics, but cohesion is provided, especially in the last sentence,more by the lexical patterns of conplicated...difficult...easy and greater tine...long... short than by any linking of specifically mathematical concepts:

[1:33] Throughout the long history of mathcmatics, men havc always wishcd that they could calculate more quickly.As each mathematical discovery was made and knowledge advanced a little thc calculations facing mathematicians became ore and more complicated and demanded an even greater time. There are some people who like doing long and difficult arithmetic, but most of us do not and are eager to finish our sums in the shortest and easiest way.\*

A text then, can be thought of as the basic unit of mcaning in language. It is to semantic strucrure what the sentence is to lexicogrammatical structure and the syllable to phonological structure. It is a unit of situationalsemantic organization:a continuum of mcaning-in-context, constructed around thc semantic rclation of cohesion. According to the particular situational-semantic configuration,or kEGisrR,of the text,so the forms takcn by thc cohcsivc rclation will differ:texture in informal conversation is quite unlikc that in formal written language,which is onc rcason why the former looks strangc whcn written down and thc lattcr sounds odd when read aloud. A text thercfore normally has continuity of rcgister; it fitsa givcn sct of situational features a pattern forned by the nature of the communicativc event (field),thc placc assigned to language acts within the event (mode) and the role-rclationships of those who are participating tenor).This fit does not by itself cnsurc thc kind of continuity we associate with texts; we often feel, in looking at children's writing for example, that it oughr to hang togcthcr preciscly because it is making sense in thc situation,but in fact it docs not.This rcveals the existence of the other aspect of texturc, which is cohesion.The mcaning rclations which constitutc cohesion arc a property of text as such and hcncc thcy are general to texts of all types, however much they may differ in thc particular form they take in one text or another.

Texture results from thc combination of semantic configurations of two kinds: those of register,and thosc of cohcsion. The rcgistcr is the set of semantic configurations that is typically associatcd with a particular CLAss of contexts of situation and defines the substance of the text: wHAT IT MEANs, in thc broadest sense, including all the components of its meaning,social,expressive, communicative and so on as well as representational (scc 1.3.4_below).Cohcsion is thc sct of meaning relations that is gcneral to ALL CLAsses of text,that distinguishes tcxt from 'non-text and interrelates thc substantive meanings of the tcxt with each other. Cohcsion does not conccrn what a text means; it concerns how the tcxt is constructcd as a semantic edifice.

# 1.3.4 The place of cohesion in the linguistic system

Table I summarizes the main components in the linguistic system, showing where cohesion comes in relation to thc rest.

Therc arc three major functional-scmantic.componcnts, the IDEATIONAL, the INTERPERSONAL and the TEXTUAL. Thc IDEATIONAL component is that part of the linguistic system which is concerned with the expression ofcontentwith the function that language has of bcing ABour something.It has two parts to it, thc cxpcriential and the logical, thc former being more dircctly concerned with the represcntation of expcricnce,of the contextof culture'in Malinowskis terms, while the latter exprcsses the abstractlogical relations which derive only indirectly from experience.Thc/INTERPERsONAL component is concerned with thc social, expressive and conative functions of languagc, with expressing thc speaker's 'angle':his attitudes and judgments,his encoding of the role rclationships in the situation, and his motivc in saying anything at all. We can summarize these by saying that the ideational componcnt represents the speakcr in his role as obscrver, while thc intcrpcrsonal component represents thc speaker in his rolc as intruder.

Thcre is a third component, thc/rexruAL,which is the text-forming component in thc linguistic systen. This comprises thc resourccs that languagc has for creating tcxtin the same scnsc inlwhich we havc been using the tcrm all along: for being opcrationally rclevant, and cohering within itsclf and with the context .of situation.

In part, thc textual component operatcs like the other two, through systcms associatcd with particular ranks in thc grammar see 7.4.I bclow). For cxample, every clausc makes a selection in thc systcm of rHeME a selection which conveys thc speaker's organization of the clause as a message and which is expresscd through thc normal mechanisms of clause structure.But the textual component also incorporates patterns of meaning which are realized outside the hierarchical organization of thc system. Onc of these is INFO RMA TION structure,which is the ordering of the tcxt, independently ofits construction in terms of sentences,clauses and the like, into units of information on the basis of the distinction into GiveN and NE w:what the speaker is trcating as information that is recoverable to the hearer given and what he is trcating as non-recoverablcnew.This aspect of thneaning of the text is rcalized in English by intonation, the information unit bcing expressed as onc TONE GROUP.

Thc remaining part of the textual component is that which is conccrncd with cohcsion.Cohesion is closely relatcd to information structurc, and indeed thc two overlap at one point see 5.8.2 below);but information structure is a form of structure, in which the cntirc tcxt is blocked out into clemcnts having one or other function in the total configuration - cverything in the text has some status in the given-new'framework.Cohcsion, on the other hand, is a potential for rclating one elcment in thc text to another,whcrever they are and without any implication that everything in the text has some part in it.The information unit is a structural unit, although it cuts across the hicrarchy of structural units or constituents in thc grammar therank scale'of sentence,clause and so on);but thcrc are no structural units defincd by the cohcsive relation.

Cohesion, therefore, is part of thc tcxt-forming component-in the linguistic system. It is thc means whcrcby elements that _arc structurally unrelated to onc another are linkcd togcther, through the depcndence of onc on the othcr for its interpretation.Thc resourccs that makc up thc cohesive potential are part of the total mcaning potential of the language, having a kind of catalytic function in thc sense that, without cohesion, the remainder of the semantic system cannot be effectively activated at all.

# 1.3.5 The meaning of cohesion

The simplest and most gencral forms of the cohesive relation are \*equals' and and': identity of reference, and conjoining.We shall discuss thc meanings of these and of the other forms of cohesion, and rclated meanings in other parts of the linguistic system, in a rather summary way in Chapter 7, after the detailed discussion of each typc. The means of expressing thcse various types of cohcsion arc, as we have seen, drawn from a number of areas of the lexicogrammatical system, which have in common mcrely the fact that thcy contribute to the realization of cohesion. Thc pcrsonal pronoun he, the verb substitute do and the adjunct nevertheless would not be likely to appear on the same page in a description of English grammar; still more remote would be any reference to the phenomena of ellipsis or to the repetition of lexical items.But these do come togcther in this book, because they are all text-forming agencies. A sentence displaying any of thesc fcatures is an invitation to a text.If the invitation is taken up-if thcre is in the environment another sentence containing the required key to the interpretation-the text comes into being.

We have noted the significance of the sentence, as the highest structural unit in the grammar. The relation among the clements within thc scntence, together with thc order in which the elements occur (which is onc of the mcans of realizing these relations), is dctcrmined by thc structure. Between scntences, howcver, there are no such structural relations; and there arc no grammatical restrictions on thc scqucnce in which sentcnces arc put togcther.Hcncc the sentences of [1:32] could follow cach other in any ordcr, without in any way affecting the total mcaning of the passage.

The sentences of a text, however, arc related to cach othcr both substantively and by cohesion; and it is a characteristic of a text that thc sequcncc of the sentences cannot be disturbed without destroying or radically altering the mcaning.A text has mcaning as a text, whereas a passage consisting of more than one text has no meaning as a whole; it is simply the sum of its parts.Within a text thc mcaning of each sentence depends on its environment, including its cohcsive relations with other sentences.When wc consider cohesion, thercforc,we are investigating the linguistic mcans whereby a text is enabled to function as a singlc meaningful unit.

To round off this general introduction, let us look at one further cxample, with a bricf discursive commcntary on its cohesion:

[134] The Cat only grinned whcn it saw Alice. Come, it's plcascd so farthought Alice, and she went on. Would you tell me,pleasc,which way I ought to go from here?' That depcnds a good deal on where you want to get to said the Cat. I don't much care where-'said Alicc. Then it doesn't matter which way you go,said the Cat. - so long as I get somewhere, Alice added as an explanation. Oh you're sure to do that said the Cat, if you only walk long enough'

Starting at the end,we find the words do that occurring as a verbal substitutc for get somewhere;this in turn relatcs by lexical cohesion to where you want to get to and thence to which way I onght to go.Thc form oh is a conjunction relating the Cat's answer to Alicc's preceding remark; and in similar fashion the Cats interruption is relatcd to I don't much care where by the conjunction then.The elliptical form where presupposcs $( I )$ get to;and care, in I don't much care, is lexically related to want. The reference item that, in that depends presupposcs thc whole of Alice's question and the it in Alice's first remark presupposes the Cat,also by reference.Finally both the proper names Alice and the Cat form cohesivc chains by rcpctition, leading back to the first sentencc of the passage.

A systematic analysis of cohesion in a number of other passages is given in the final section of Chapter 8.Table 1 shows where cohesion belongs in relation to the grammar of the language as a whole.

# Chapter 2

# Reference

# 2.1 Endophoric and exophoric rcference

There are certain itcms in every language which have thc property of reference, in thc specific sense in which we are using the term here; that is to say instead of being intcrpreted semantically in thcir own right, they make refcrcnce to somcthing else for thcir intcrpretation. In English these items are personals, demonstratives and comparatives.

We start with an example of each:

[2:1] a. Thrce blind mice, three blind micc. Sce how they run! Scc how they run b.Doctor Foster went to Gloucester in a shower of rain. He stepped in a puddle right up to his middle and never went there again. c.There were two wrens upon a trcc. Another came, and thcrc were three

In a)they refers to three blind micein b there rcfcrs to Gloucester in canother refers to wrens.

These items are directives indicating that information is to be retricved from clsewhere. So much thcy have in common with all cohesive clements.What characterizes this particular typc of cohesion, that which we are calling REreRencE, is the specific nature of thc information-that is signalled for retrieval. In the casc of reference the information to be retricved is the refcrential meaning, the identity of the particular thing or class of things that is bcing refcrrcd to; and thc cohesion lics in thc continuity of refcrence, whercby thc same thing cnters into the discourse a sccond time. In See how they run, they means not merely thrcc blind mice'but the same thrce blind mice that we have just been talking about'. This is sometimcs exprcssed by the formula that all reference itcms  contain the dcfinitc articlesince the dcfinitc article is the itcm that in English, carries thc meaning of specific idcntity or definitcncss'in its pure form scc 2.4.2.bclow.But this is putting it in unneccssarily concrete terms; thcrc is no need to imagine a the lurking in every reference itcm.It is enough to say that refcrcnce has the semantic property of definiteness,or specificity.

In principle this spccificity can be achieved by reference to the context of situation. By contrast to substitution, which is a grammatical relation scc Chaptcr 3 below)referencc is a scmantic relation.One of the consequences of this distinction, as we shall see, is that substitution is subject to a very strong grammatical condition:the substitute must bc of the same grammatical class as the item for which it substitutes.This restriction does not apply to rcferencc.Sincc thc relationship is on the semantic lcvcl, the refcrence itcm is in no way constraincd to match the grammatical class of thc item it refers to.What must match are the semantic propertics.But these necd not neccssarily have been encoded in the text; they may be retricvable fron thc situation,as in

[2:2] For hc's a jolly good fellow And so say all of us.

where thc tcxt does not make it explicit who he is,although his identity is not in doubt to those who are present.

It has been suggested in fact that reference to the situation is thc prior form of referencc, and that reference to anothcr itcm within thc tcxt is a secondary or derivcd form of this relation.This sccms quite plausiblc, even though it is not cntirely clear what it mcans; is thc priority a historical one, or is it in somc sense logical? It is ccrtainly possiblc that, in thc cvolution of language,situational reference prcccded tcxt rcference: in othcr words,that the meaning 'the thing you scc in front of you'cvolved carlicr than the meaning the thing I have just mentioned'Bcing present in thc text is, as it were, a special case of being present in thc situation.We tend to see matters the other way round; thc word conrexr, for examplc, means literally accompanying text and its use in thc collocation cONTEXT OF situATioN secms to us a metaphorical extension. But it is fairly easy to see that there is a logical continuity from naming referring to a thing independently of thc contcxt of situation),through situational reference (referring to a thing as identified in the context of situation to textual referencc (rcferring to a thing as idcntified in the surrounding text);and in this pcrspectivc, situational rcfercnce would appear as the prior form.

Wc shall find it useful in the discussion to have a special term for situational rcfcrcnce.This we are referring to as ExOPHORA, Or ExOPHORIC reference;and we could contrast it with ENDOpHoRIC as a general name for referencc within the text:

As a general rulc, thcrcfore, reference items nay bc cxophoric or endophoric; and,if cndophoric, they may be anaphoric or cataphoric f 1.9 above).This scheme will allow us to recognize certain distinctions within thc class of reference items, according to their different uscs and 'phoric tendencies.

Exophora is not simply a synonym for referential meaning. Lexical items likc John or tree or run have rcferential meaning in that they arc names for some thing:object, class of objects, process and thc like.An exophoric item, however,is onc which docs not name anything;it signals that reference must be made to the context of situation.Both cxophoric and endophoric reference embody an instruction to retrievc from clsewhere thc information necessary for intcrpreting the passage in qucstion; and taken in isolation a reference item is simply neutral in this respcct- if we hear a fragmcnt of conversation such as

[2:3] That must have cost a lot of money.

we havc no means of knowing whcthcr the that is anaphoric or exophoric. The prcvious speaker might havc said,I've just been on holiday in Tahitior the participants might bc looking at their hosts collcction of antique silver; and if both thcsc conditions hold good, thc interpretation will rcmain doubtful. Ambiguous situations of this kind do in fact quite often arise.

What is cssential to cvery instancc of refcrence whether endophoric textual) or cxophoric situational is that thcrc is a presupposition that must be satisficd; the thing referrcd to has to bc idcntifiable somchow.

One of thc fcatures that distinguish different REGisreRs is the rclative amount of exophoric referencc that thcy typically display.If the situation is one of languagc-in-action with the language playing a relatively small and subordinatc rolc in thc total cvent, the tcxt is likcly to contain a high proportion of instanccs of cxophoric referencc.Hcncc, as Jean Urc has demonstratcd in hcr studies of different registers, it is often difficult to interpret a text of this kind if onc only hears it and has no visual rccord available.

It is important to makc this point, and to emphasizc that the spccial Havour of language-in-action is not a sign that it is ungrammatical,simplificd, or incomplete. It is often highly complex, although we have no vcry convincing measurcs of structural complexity;and if it appears ungrammatical or incomplcte this is largcly due to the preponderance of rcfcrcnce items used exophorically,which seem incomplete bccause their presuppositions are unresolved. A high degree of cxophoric reference is onc characteristic of the languagc of the children's pccr group.When children interact with each other, espccially young children, they do so through constant rcfcrcncc to things;and since the things which serve as refcrence points are prcsent in the immediate environment they are typically referred to exophorically. In the same way the adult is expected to pick up the necessary clues from the context of situation, as in this exchange betwecn one of the prcsent authors and her thrce-ycar-old son:

[2:4] Child:Why docs THAr onc come out? Parent:That what? Child: THAT one. ParentThat what? Child:That ONE! ParentThat one what? Child:That Icver there that you push to let thc water out.

It did not occur to the child that hc could point to thc object in question, presumably becausc it did not occur to hin that what was in His focus of attention was not also in everyone else's, a limitation that is characteristic of the cgocentric phase of interaction.

Bernstein has shown that one characteristic of speech that is rcgulated by REsTRicTED cODE is the largc amount of exophoric rcferencc that is associated with it and the researchers in his team havc found abundant evidence of this.He characterizes it in terms of dependence on the context of situation: exophoric referencc is one form of context-depcndence, since without thc contcxt wc cannot interprct what is said.Let us quote one of Bcrnstein's passages in which this point is brought out.

We can distinguish between uses of language which can be called context boundand uses of language which are less context bound. Consider,for examplc, the two following stories which Peter Hawkins, Assistant Research Officer in thc Sociological Rcsearch Unit, constructed as a result of his analysis of the speech of middle-class and working-class fivc-year-old children.Thc children werc given a series of four picturcs which told a story and thcy were invited to tell thc story.The first picturc showed some boys playing football; in thc second the ball goes through the window of a housc;thc third shows a woman looking out of thc window and a man making an ominous gesture, and in the fourth the children are moving away. Hcre are the two stories:

1 Thrcc boys are playing football and one boy kicks the ball and it goes through the window and the ball breaks the window and the boys are looking at it and a man comcs out and shouts at thcm bccause they've broken the window so they run away and thcn that lady looks out of her window and shc tells the boys off.   
2) They're playing football and he kicks it and it gocs through there it brcaks the window and thcy're looking at it and he comes out and shouts at them because thcy'vc broken it so they run away and then she looks out and she tells them off.

With the first story the reader does not have to have thc four pictures which were used as thc basis for the story,whereas in the case of thc second story the reader would require the initial pictures in order to make sensc of thc story.The first story is frcc of the context which generated it, whercas the second story is much more closcly tied to its context.

There is nothing ungrammatical about the sccond version of the story, nor is it any simpler in its structurc;but it is context-bound'because it depends on exophoric reference-he,she they and there havc no possiblc interpretation without the pictures.Noticc that in the other version wc do not get any significantly greater AmouNr of information.The equivalents of theyhe, he and she are three boys, one boya man and that lady; but we know the scx from the pronouns, and we could have guessed which were children and which were adults from the story.And it is not hard to infer that through there means through the window.The significant differencc between the two versions is that three boys, one boy and a an do not presuppose anything else.Thcy are not very spccific in themselves;but thcy carry no implication that any furthcr specification is available from clscwhcre, and hencc thcy are not context-bound.(On the other hand that lady docs contain an cxophoric that; if Hawkins had wanted to be totally consistent he would have had to write a lady.For the intcresting case of the in through the window scc 2.4.2 bclow.)

If children's spccch is characterized by a tendency towards exophoric reference,this is bccause it is neighbourhood speech, the languagc of the children's peer group. Wc know very little about neighbourhood speech; but it seems likely that it is highly cxophoric,no doubt becausc of the way children tend to rclate to things, and to relate to each other through things. Typically in peer group interaction the context of situation is thc material cnvironment-thc things'are therc in front of one-and there is also a reservoir of shared cxperience, a common context of culture; so cxophoric reference poses no problems and, in fact, any more explicit naming would be unnatural. The restricted code' nature of neighbourhood language is a positive feature; one should not bc misled by the word'restricted,which is an abstract technical term referring to the highly coded, non-redundant propertics of speech in this semantic mode.Such speech is characteristic not only of the neighbourhood but of all close-knit social groups; for cxample, to quote from onc of Bernstein's dcscriptions,

prison inmates, combat units of the armed forcescriminal subcultures, the peer group of children and adolescents, and married couples of long standing'.

It becomes ResTRicrING if it is transferred to contexts in which it is inappropriate; if Bcrnstcin has emphasized the damaging consequences of restrictcd codc in thc context of formal education, this is not becausc of any deficiency in restricted codc as such but because the educational context is one to which ncighbourhood and peer group semantic stylcs arc not relevant.The problcm lies as much in the nature of formal cducation as in the nature of rcstricted codc.

There are of course many other aspects to restrictcd code than a high frequency of exophoric rcfercnce.But one of the principal charactcristics of restricted code is dcpendencc on the context, and thc exophoric usc of referencc items is one form such dependcncc takes.

A refcrcnce item is not of itsclf cxophoric or cndophoric; it is just phoric'-it simply has the property of reference.Any given InsrANce of refercncc may be cithcr onc or thc othcr, or it may even be both at once. We shall see in this chapter that there arc tendencies for particular items or classcs of items to be used exophorically or endophorically; but the referencc rclation is itself neutral: it mercly means'scc clsewhere'.On the other hand, as wc have cmphasizcd already, only endophoric reference is cohesive.Exophoric rcfcrcnce contributes to thc cReATioN of text in that it links the language with thc context of situation;but it docs not contributc to the INTEGRATION of onc passage with another so that thc two togcthcr form part of the sAMe tcxt. Hence it does not contributc directly to cohcsion as we have defined it.

For this rcason we shall take only little account of cxophoric reference, not attenpting to describe it in detail but bringing it in where it relates to and contrasts with rcfcrence within the text.Wc shall trcat  endophoric reference as thc norm; not implying by this that it is the logically prior form of thc rcfcrencc rclation,but mcrcly that it is thc form of it which plays a part in cohesion, and which thercforc has priority in the context of the present study.At the same time,howevcr, whcrc we identify TYPES OF REFERENCE and REFERENCE ITEMS in thc languagc, we do sO On thc critcrion of reference potential without rcgard to thc cndophoric/cxophoric distinction. A refcrcnce item is any onc which has this potential, and a systematic account of thc different types of refcrcncc and their placc in thc linguistic system has to be based on the gcncralized concept of rcfcrence and not on the particular concrctc forn that it takes when incorporated into the text.

# 2.2Types of reference

There arc thrcc types of rcfercnce: pcrsonal, demonstrative, and comparative.

Personal rcfcrence is rcferencc by mcans of function in the speech situation, through the category of pERson (Table 2).

Demonstrative reference is referencc by means of location, on a scalc Of PROxIMITY (Table 3).

Comparative reference is indirect refercnce by means of IDeNriry or SIMILARITY (Table 4).

Grammatically, all reference items except thc dcmonstrative adverbs, and some comparative adverbs,function within thc nominal group (noun phrasc.It will be ncccssary therefore to give a bricf account of thc struc

ture of thc nominal group in order to explain the grammar of reference in morc cxplicit terms.\*

The logical structure of thc nominal group is one of modification; it consists of a HEAD,with optional MoDiFIER.The modifying elements include some which precede the head and some which follow it; thc distinction in the relative position of modifying elements is scmantically significant, so it is uscful to makc it terminologically cxplicit,and we shall refer to modification preceding the hcad by the tcrm PReMoDiriER and to that following thc head by thc tcrm POsTMoDiFIER.Thus in

[2:5 The two high stonc walls along the roadside the Hcad is walls, thc Premodificr is formed by the two hig/ stone and the Postmodifier by along the roadside.

Thc Head is typically expressed by a common noun, propcr noun or pronoun.Usually only common nouns accept modification; pronouns and propcr nouns tend to occur alone (sec below.

Simultaneously thc nominal group is structured along another dimension,the experiential-that is,in terms of the function that languagc has of cxpressing (the spcaker's experience of) phcnomena of the real world cf 1.3.4 above).This has thc cffect of introducing subdivisions within the Modifier, although thcse arc not in fact subcatcgories of Modifier but, as we have said, structural roles dcriving from a different functional component within thc scmantics.The clements of this structure are DEIcTIC, NUMERA TIVE, EPITHET, CLASSIFIER, QUALIFIER, and what We shall call THING.

The structural analysis of $\left[ 2 : 5 \right]$ is now as follows; the last line shows the classes of word (or, in one case, rankshifted group) which rcalize the functions in question.These arc the typical classes associated with each function.

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">two</td><td>high</td><td>stone</td><td>walls</td><td>along the roadside</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">logical experiential</td><td colspan="3"></td><td>Head</td><td></td><td>Postmodifier</td></tr><tr><td>Deictic</td><td>Numera- tive</td><td>Epithet</td><td>Classifier</td><td>Thing</td><td>Qualifier</td></tr><tr><td>Classes</td><td>derer- miner</td><td>numeral</td><td>adjec- tive</td><td>noun</td><td>noun</td><td>[prepositional group]</td></tr></table></body></html>

As far as thc expcricntial' structurc is concerned, the Deictic is normally a detcrmincr, thc Numcrative a numeral or other quantificr, the Epithet an adjectivc and the Classifier a common or propcr noun;but thc correspondence of class and function is far from bcing onc to one-adjectives, for example, regularly function both as Deictic and as Classifier, eg their famous old red wine Deictic Deictic Epithet Classifier Thing deterniner adjcctive adjective adjective noun (whercas famous in a famons victory and red in red paint arc both functioning as Epithct). Thc Qualificr is normally a rankshifted rclative clause or prcpositional phrase. Apart from the Thing, all elemcnts in thc cxperiential structure may occur morc than once; notc that this does Nor refer to coordination, since coordinatc items function as single units - in boys and girls there are two nouns but only onc Thing, and in hot or cold tea thcre arc two adjectives but only onc Epithet.

The logical structurc is somewhat diffcrent; here therc is always a Head, but it may be of any class and may bc mapped on to any of thc cxperiential functions. This can best be explaincd by illustration:

<html><body><table><tr><td>these</td><td>two</td><td>custo~ mcrs</td><td>these</td><td>two</td><td>these</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Modifier</td><td>Head</td><td>Modi- ficr</td><td>Head</td><td>Head</td></tr><tr><td>Deictic</td><td>Numerative</td><td>Thing</td><td>Deictic</td><td>Numerative</td><td>Dcictic</td></tr></table></body></html>

Similarly in the old we have the function of Head combincd with that of Epithct and in the red (in the sense of the red wine $e g$ in $I ^ { \prime } I l$ take the red) Head combincd with Classifier.Where the Head is a noun,it may be not only a common noun, as in [2:s], but also a proper noun or pronoun.To avoid thc confusion usually inhercnt in the use of the word noun, let us reprcsent its mcaning as follows:

![](img/268ce4159acc005d0ebd19fe05e25d66041866fd9791dfbad043d95e89242da4.jpg)

We shall avoid as far as possiblc thc use of noun in the sense of noun that ofnominal word'in the most generalized schemc of word classes.In almost all cases its usc will correspond to noun,nominal word that is the typical exponent of a ThingExcLuDinG adjcctivc,numeral quantifier and determiner but IncLuDinG pronoun and proper noun as wcll as common noun. Whcn it is nccessary to indicatc common or propcr noun,but cxcluding pronoun, the locutiOn COMMON OR PROPER NOUN will bc uscd; since proper nouns in many ways resemblc pronouns rather than common nouns, there is no particular reason for using noun in just this sensc.Occasionally,whcrc thc context makes it clcar, Noun will bc uscd in thc sense of noun3,common noun'only.All other uses of noun, thosc in which it refcrs to clements highcr than words -phrases, clauscs, nominalizations of any kind, arc avoided altogcthcr.

If thc Head is a proper noun or pronoun, it usually occurs without modification. It is beyond our scopc hcrc to go furthcr into thc analysis and interprctation of the nominal group;but for purposes of cohesion it is important to clarify and explain the structure up to this point.Common nouns designate classes of things; so they are liable to be further specificd, and the gcneral mcaning of the functions Deictic, Numerative, Epithet, Classificr and Qualificr is that of spe ciFicATion.The Deictic specifies by identity,non-specific as wcll as specific which train?a train, all trains and including idcntity based on reference (this train,my train);the Numerative by quantity or ordination two trains, next train;the Epithet by rcfcrence to a property long trains);the Classificr by refcrcnce to a subclass express trains, passenger trains); and the Qualifier by rcfcrcnce to somc characterizing relation or process trains for Londontrain I' on.These functions are introduced into the nominal group through thc logical structurc of modificationbeing mappcd on to the function of Modifierhence, common nouns are typically modificd.But pronouns and proper names are not as a rule susceptible of further specification.The catcgory of pronoun is a mixcd bag;but it comprises PERsONAL and INDEFINITE pronouns,of which the personals, as we have secn, are rcfercnce items and thcrefore takc over the spccificity of whatever it is thcy arc presupposing,while the indefinites (eg: somcthing,everybody) alrcady embody a non-specific dcictic component in thcir meaning and cannot be spccificd further.Proper names designate individuals, and are therefore fully spccified in their own right.Proper namcs can accept DEscriprive modification, as in that Charlie Brown beautiful Buttermere; this is a derived function of the modifying structure and one which differs in certain significant ways (for example, dcscriptive modifiers do not admit of ellipsis; see Chapter 4).

But the normal pattcrn is: with Modifier if the Hcad is a common noun, without Modifier if the Hcad is proper noun or pronoun.

Finally thcre is thc structural relation of suBMoDiFicA Ton,by which a Modificr is itsclf further modified. Submodifiers are typically adverbs, such as veryequally too; they may also be rankshifted prepositional groups, likc in every way in an in every way valiant attenpt.Submodificrs arc most frequent within the Epithet, though thcy can be found clsewhere.

It will bc ncccssary to refer to the structure of the nominal group at frequcnt points in the discussion of cohcsion. To citc onc cxample, it is a regular sourcc of cllipsis, and we can dcfinc an clliptical noninal group as one in which there is no overt Thing and the Head is therefore combined with some other function.What distinguishes reference from other types of cohesion,howevcr, is that rcfcrcnce is overwhelmingly nominal in character.With the cxccption of the demonstrativc adverbs here, there, now, and then, and some comparatiye adverbs, all rcferencc itcms are found within thc nominal group.They may have any of the functions in the'cxpcricntial' structure except thosc of Classificr and Qualifier. It is not that thesc clements cannot also incorporatc cohesive reference - thcy can, but if so the refcrence item functions as something else, typically as Deictic, in a rankshifted nominal group, eg:that rcferring to box in

[2:6] It's an old box camera. $^ { - \bar { 1 } }$ ncvcr had one of that kind.

The classification of referencc itcms is not, however, based on thcir function in thc nominal group; it is based on the type of referencc involved.This is a semantic classification and cuts across the classification according to grammatical function. At the same time thc typc of rcference is not unrelatcd to the form which it takes in the grammar, and to the classes of word which function as reference items.This will be discussed and exemplified where necessary in what follows.

# 2.3 Personal rcference

The category of peRsonALs includes the three classes of personal pronouns,possessive dctcrminers (usually called possessive adjectivcs), and possessive pronouns. There is no gencral name for this category in traditional grammar,because the members of it belong to different classcs with diverse structural roles; but in fact thcy represent a single system,that of PERSON:

![](img/cfc3e90d55ea131ed70b881b417214b04f9918a8ac9d48a520f6c1209752fb9c.jpg)

In tabular form:

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="3">Speech roles</td><td colspan="3">Other roles</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Speaker</td><td>Addressee</td><td colspan="2">Specific Non-</td><td>Generalized Hunan</td></tr><tr><td>one</td><td>I me</td><td></td><td>Human he him his his</td><td>human it it</td><td rowspan="3">one one -one&#x27;s</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>mine my</td><td>you you</td><td>she her hers her</td><td>[its] its</td></tr><tr><td>more than one</td><td>we us ours our</td><td>yours your</td><td>they them theirs their</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

These items are all rcference itcms; they refcr to somcthing by specifying its function or role in the specch situation. This system of reference is known as Person, where person'is used in the special scnse of role; the traditionally recognized catcgorics arc FIRST PERsON, SECOND PERSON and THIRD PERsON, intersecting with the NUMBER categories of SINGULA R and PLURAL.The actual system found in thc scmantics of languages is nearly always a departurc in some way from this ideal'type; that of English is as sct out above, with onc or two further complexitics which will bc brought up in thc discussion -including thc so-callcd impersonal uscs of we,you and they.

Thc tcrm PERsoN might sccm a littlc misleading,as thc system includes not only impersonal'meanings which arc actually still personal, ie human; thcy arc mcrcly not individualized) but also refcrence that is truly non-pcrsonal, refcrence to objects. But most grammatical tcrms have fuzzy cdges; they express thc central or typical meaning of the category in question, and arc justificd by being in this way simplc and easy to remembcr. The alternatives would be either to use purely abstract labels, such as lettcrs and numbcrs, which have no mnemonic valuc;or to attempt more accurate designations, which would soon becomc cumbcrsome and syntactically recalcitrant. The technical term itself is not part of any linguistic thcory; it is simply an address' for easy recovery.

# 2.3.1 Semantic distinctions in the personal system

The significance of the PERsoN systcm is that it is thc means of rcferring to RELEvANT persons and objccts, making usc of a small sct of options centring around thc particular nature of thcir rclevance to thc spcech situation.The principal distinction is that betwccn the PERsONs DErINeD BY THEIR ROLES IN THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS, On thc One hand, and all other cntities on the other. Thc former wc shall call sPEECH ROLEs;they arc the rolcs of sPEAKER and ADDREssEE.Thesc are the two roles assigned by thc spcaker; and we usc addresscc' in prcfcrencc to hcarer'or listener'in order to suggest the ineaning pcrson DesIGNATED BY IHE SPEAKER AS recipient of thc communication'-as distinct from one who chooses to listcn or happens to hear.Thc latter, which we shall call simply OTHeR ROIEs, include all other rclevant entities, OTHER IHAN spcaker or addresscc. In terms of thc traditional categories of person, the distinction is that betwecn first and sccond pcrson on the one hand I, you we and third pcrson on the other he sheit, they one.

Each of thesc personal forms entcrs into the structurc in one of two guises: eithcr as participant in some process, or as possessor of some entity. If the former, it falls into thc class NouN, subclass PRONoun, and functions as Head-and sole clcment -in the nominal group; it then has onc form when that nominal group is the SubjectIyouwe heshe it they, one) and in most cases a different form whcn it is anything other than subject me youushimheritthemone.If thc latterit falls into the class DETRMinR and then functions cither as Hcad mineyours ourshis hers, [its]theirs or as Modificr myyourour his heritstheirone'sExamples:

a1had a cat I: participant;

b) the cat pleased participant; non-Subject pronoun Head c take minc mine: possessor determiner Hcad d my plate's cmpy possessor determiner Modifier

Note that one never orcurs 1s possessor/Head, although it does as possessor Modifier we can say D thy pay one's debts?but not Dothey only pay their wn dets or do th   esThere is a rason for thiswhich will appear later. Thc m is i aso rare as Head, although there sems to be oery  ths triction and, in fact, i  ocur, e [2:7] You know tha mouse you saw? Well that hole there must be its.

Within each of the two major categories of personals, further distinctions are built into the sy stem.Within the spcech roles, the English person system recognizes only soaker / and addressee you, making no distinction according  the mmr drsses or according to the socil hrarchy or the social dist.nce Itween addresse and spcaker.\* It does however comprise a third torm  representing the speakcr together with some Other person or persons. mng whom the addressee(s) may or may not bc included. $^ { \dagger }$

As far as the rem.umng tms are concerned, those which refer to other roles, not to spcakr or hnsee, the distinctions are fairly cearcut. There is a generalized prnal fom with human refrent, one, perhaps borrowed from French n although it is not restricted to functioning as Subject as on is; in the tollow my, example, only the second of the four could have on in French translattn:

[2:8] Thcy coulin't to a thing likec that to onc. - One ncver knows, docs onelt nks one think though.

There is a diffcrcnce between British and Amcrican English as regards rcpctition of one within the sentence:British English retains one in second and subsequent occurrences, where American English normally substitutes he:

[2:9] One can hardly be expected to revcal onc's/his innermost secrets to the first casual enquirer, can one/he?

The rest of the othcr roles' arc non-generalized: they makc specific reference to persons or things, and thc categories arc familiar to cvcry studcnt of English from lesson one:plural, with no distinction of pcrsons and things, theysingularhumanmale he female she,non-human it.Animals arc trcated sometimes as persons and somctimes as things; the lower orders of creation are referred to as it the highcr ordcrs cithcr as it or as he/she depending on a wholc number of variables, primarily thc spcakcr's relationship to thc spccics in qucstion (farmcr and farm animal,pet owncr and pet, for exanplc),but also on his individual prcference. If the referencc is to a single human being,but with the sex unknown or unspecified, the form used is he, as in

[2:10] If thc buycr wants to know the condition of the propcrty,he has to havc another survey carried out on his own behalf.\*

This mcans that, as in many languages, the masculine is the syntactically unmarked form.This is a matter of concern to some, since they sec in it another manifestation of thc subjection of women and want to insist on he or she or presumably she or he in such instances.Not all languages cnforce the sex distinction; in Chinese therc is only onc word mcaning both he and she,just as there is only the one word they as contrastcd with ils and elles) for thc plural in English.And it cannot be denied that, whatever the origins of thc unmarked masculine'-they lie far back in the history of IndoEuropean -the use of he has its problems.The authors of the Breakthrough to Literacy Teacher's Manual uscd he to refcr to a child but she to refer to a teacher, on thc grounds that infant tcachers are more oftcn female -a reasoning that might equally bc objcctcd to:

[2:11 It is most important to note that a child who tells his teacher an imaginative story which she subsequently writes down for him is not engaged in creative writing; but in creative speaking.

No doubt the authors were glad to bc able to avoid the possiblc ambiguities that might arise if both child and teachcr were referred to by identical personal forms.

# 2.3.2 Speech roles and other roles

The usc of personal forms as rcference items with a cohesive function is so all-pervading in English that it hardly needs illustrating.The following is from Alice's conversation with the flowers:

[2:12] 'Aren't you sometimes frightened at bcing planted out herc, with nobody to take care of you?' Therc's thc trcc in the middlesaid thc Rose.What clsc is it good for?' But what could it do, if danger camc?'Alice asked. It could barksaid thc Rose. It says Bough-wough!cried a Daisy:that's why its branches are called boughs!'

Four occurrences of it, and one of its rcfcr anaphorically to the tree. To appreciate the effect of thc use of personals, and cohesive items of all kinds, wirhour appropriate rcferents, see the verses rcad out by the Whitc Rabbit as evidence in Alice in Wonderland, Chaptcr 12, bcginning

[2: 13] They told me you had been to her And mentioned mc to him.

The whole poem is an excellent example of a pscudo-tcxt

There is a distinction to be made, however, betwcen the speech roles (first and second person and the other roles (third person).Only the third person is inherently cohesive, in that a third person form typically refers anaphorically to a preceding item in thc text.First and second pcrson forms do not nornally rcfcr to the text at all; their referents are defined by the speech roles of speakcr and hearer, and hence they are normally interpreted exophorically, by reference to the situation.This is an important distinction in principlc: there is a major division within the pcrson system between thc third person,which as far as the speech situation is concerned is not aperson- not a role - at all it can only bc defined ncgatively as not first or second'), and the first and second persons which arc defined as roles in the spcech situation.The first and second person forms csscntially refcr to the situation, whereas those of the third person csscntially refer anaphorically or cataphorically to the text.

Hence the absence of any verbal reference for I and you docs not normally lead to any sensc of incompletencss. In written languagc thcy arc anaphoric when they occur in quoted direct) spccch, as opposcd to thosc instances where the writer is addressing his readcrs; so in [1:34] I and you have as verbal referents Alice and the Cat. Comparc

[2:14] There was a brief note from Susan.Shc just said,I an not coming homc this wcekend.'

where I, in thc quotcd clauserefers back,like the preceding she,to Susan in the first sentcncc.These are instances of anaphora, albeit indirect anaphora; I still refers to the speaker,but we have to look in the text to find out who the speaker is. In general however $\boldsymbol { I }$ and you are given by the situation other than in cases of quoted speech, if wc are in onthc text at all we arc usually ourselves occupying one or other of the spccch roles.

Conversely, a third person form docs normally imply the prescnce of a rcfcrent somewhcre in thc text; and in the abscncc of such a rcfcrent the text appears incomplctc.Thc meaning male person other than spcaker or addrcssee' is hardly spccific, so that an occurrence of he typically presupposcs a singular human masculinc common or proper noun somewhere in the vicinity.At the samc timc just as the first and second person forms, while typically cxophoric, may refer anaphorically,so also the third person forms, while typically anaphoric, may refer exophorically to some person or thing that is present in the context of situation.An example such as the following could occur as a complete text.

[2:15] Oh, he's already been?-Yes, he went by about five minutes ago.

Thc nature of thc reply shows that thc identity of he is clear to thc respondent, at lcast to his own satisfaction.As we havc cmphasizcd already, present in the context of situation'docs not necessarily mean physically present in the intcractants' ficld of pcrception;it mcrely means that the context of situation permits thc identification to bc made.The setting of the abovc cxamplc might bc some event at which a collection is being taken,whcrc thc first speakcr, money in hand, notices that those around him are no longcr proffering contributions;by this time the steward, the he of the dialoguc, is in fact well out of sight but it is obvious to both speakers who is in question.Wc may be inclined to speculate, as with other reference items, that the original mode of referencc of third person forms was actually situational, and that endophoric reference is ultimately derived from exophoric.There are reasons for thinking that reference is primarily a situational RElATioN, whcreas substitution is a textual onc scc Chapter 3).Be that as it maythe typical INstAncE of third person referencc is textual, and thcrefore cohcsive; and in many texts the third person forms constitute thc most frequent single class of cohcsive items.

Finally thcre is thcmixedpersonal we.This may refcr just to spcaker and addressee you and I),and so include in its meaning only the spcech roles; but it may cxtend to a third person or persons (either with or without thc addresse, ie hc/she/they and I or he/shc/they and you and I), in which case it is mixcd and demands a referent for the 'othcr role'. This may be exophoric, as when the leader of a delegation uscs we to refer to himself plus the group of which hc is acting as spokesman \~ who may or may not be forgathcred around him: again the concept of 'situation is an abstract one defincd not by the physical prescncc of the participants but by the institutional framework,in this case thc conccpt of a spokesmanonc who spcaks on behalf of (himself and) others'. Or it may bc anaphoric, as in

[2: 16] My husband and I are leaving.Wc have secn quite enough of this unpleasantncss.

To summarize:personals referring to thc spcech roles speaker and addressec arc typically cxophoric: this includes I and you,and we mcaning you and I'Thcy becomc anaphoric, however, in quoted speech and sc are normally anaphoric in many varieties of written language, such a narrative fiction. In narration the context of situation includes a context of rcferencca fiction that is to bc constructed from the text itself,so that all reference within it must ultimatcly be endophoric.Somewhcre or other in the narrative will be names or dcsignations to which wc can rclate thc $I$ and you of the dialoguc.A written text as a whole,however,still has its outer context of situation,in which thc writcr may refer exophorically either to himsclf, as I or we, or to his rcaders), as you or to both. This happens in lettcr-writingin first person narrativc,in advertisingin official documents addressed to the public, and in notices;for example:

[2:17 a.Dcar Carric:How are you?I had a strange dream about you last night -we were wandering togcther through a dense forest... b.I suppose my face nust have given me away,for suddcnly she swept across and kisscd mc, but fortunatcly for my good resolutions shc didn't linger closc to me but promptly rcturned to her chair. c.Look around you. Just how much of you is projected into your cnvironment, and how much of it is projected at you? d.The Mcdical Director thanks you for your attendance at the X-Ray Unit and is happy to inform you that your film is satisfaCtOry. YOU SHOULD KEEP THIS LETTER AND TAKE IT WITH YOU WHENEVER YOU IAVE AN X-RAY IN FUTURE. c.You have bcen warned!

Personals referring to other roles (persons or objccts othcr than the spcakcr or addressee are typically anaphoric; this includes he, she, it and they, and also the third pcrson component of we when prcscnt. They may bc cxophoric,howcver,whcrcver the context of situation isjudged by the spcakcr to be such as to permit identification of the referent in question.

As has been pointed out, it is only the anaphoric type of refcrence that is rclcvant to cohesion,since it provides a link with a preccding portion of the text. When we talk of the cohesive function of personal reference, thcrcforc, it is particularly the third person forms that wc have in mind. But wc shall find instances of these which are not cohesivc, as well as instances of thc first and sccond person forms which are. In spoken English, especially in contexts of languagc-in-action'thosc registers in which the verbal activity is closely interwoven with non-vcrbal activity, it is quite common for third person forms to function exophorically;but in writing an explicit referent will normally be required, and cven in speech the hcarcr is sometimes constrained to demand one - so we hear cxchanges such as:They're here!-Who are? In other words, a third person form is assumcd to bc anaphoric unless the context of situation makcs it quite unambiguous.With thc first and sccond person forms, on the othcr hand, the assumption is the othcr way round. In spoken language $I$ mcans the speaker and you means the addrcssec unless there is positive indication to the contrary in the form of a clausc introducing quoted speech; and quoted spccch,although common enough, is largcly associated with certain particular types of narrative, such as gossip and joke-tclling.In written language the exophoric use of $I$ as writer and you as audicncc is restricted to certain rcgisters;but cven in writing we find somc form of cxplicit signal quotation marks, orinvcrted commas to tell us when thcy are not bcing used in this way.

Speech roles Other roles Iyouweyou and I heshe, it, they,we and other(s))   
typically: exophoric (non-cohcsive): anaphoric (cohesive): speaker,addresscc(s); person(s or thing(s) writer, reader(s) previously referred to   
secondarily: anaphoric (cohesive): cxophoric (non-cohcsive): speaker,addressee in person(s) or things) quoted specch idcntified in context of situation

Note finally that it is characteristic of third person forms that they may bc cumulatively anaphoric.One occurrence of John at thc beginning of a tcxt may be followed by an indefinitely large number of occurrences of he, him or his all to be intcrpreted by reference to the original John This phenomenon contributes very markedly to the internal cohesion of a text, since it creates a kind of network of lines of reference, each occurrence bcing linked to all its predecessors up to and including the initial reference. The number and density of such networks is onc of the factors which gives to any text its particular flavour or texturc.

# 2.3.3 Some special kinds of personal reference

# 2.33.I EXTENDED REFERENCEAND TEXT REFERENCE

The word it differs from all other personals in that it may rcfer not only to a particular person or object, some entity that is cncoded linguistically as a participant-a noun or nominal expression-but also to any identifiable portion of text. This actually comprises two rather distinct phenomena, both of which are illustrated in the following example:

[2:18] [Thc Queen said:] Curtsey while you're thinking what to say. It saves timc. Alice wondered a little at this, but she was too much in awc of the Queen to disbelieve it.

In thc first instanccIt saves timeit refers to curtsey[ing] while you're thinking what to say; thc rcfcrence is still to athingbut not in the narrow sense of a participant (pcrson or object-it is a whole process or complex phcnomenon which is in question.Only it has the property of Ex teNDED REFERence of this kind: consider for example an eye-witncss's description of an accident concluding with the remark It all happened so quickly.

In the second instance,...to disbelieve it,the it refers not to a THinG but to a FAcr: [that curtsey[ing] while youre thinking what to say...saves time. This is an instance of TExr REFEREN CE.Whereas extcnded rcfcrence differs from usual instanccs of reference only in extent- the refcrent is morc than just a person or object, it is a process or sequence of processes (grammatically, a clause or string of clauses, not just a single nominal)- tcxt reference differs in kind: the referent is not being taken up at its face-valuc but is being transmuted into a fact or a report.Perhaps the best way to convey the distinction is through ambiguity:

2:19] It rained day and night for two weeks. Thc basement fooded and everything was under water. It spoilt all our calculations.

Either thc phenomcnon of hcavy rains and fooding, thc evenr itself, destroyed our records; or the mctaphenomenon'thc FA cr that it rained so much, upsct the wcathcr pattern that we had prcdictcd.

In addition to it, thc dcmonstratives this and that frcquently occur in both extended refercnce and text reference.Onc of the striking aspects of cohesion is the ability of hearers and rcadcrs to identify the relcvant portion of text as referent, when they are faced with it this or that in thesc uses. Clearly one of thc factors that enablcs them to do this is thc intcrnal cohesion within thc passage that is being presupposed.

# 2.3.3.2 GENERALIZED EXOPHORIC REFERENCE

Not only thc generalized personal one but also we youthey and it all have a generalized exophoric use in which the referent is treated as bcing as it were immanent in all contexts of situation.(i) You and one mean any human individualas in you never know, one never knows and often by implication any self-respecting individual, any individual I would approve of particularly in thc combination of one plus a verbal modulation as in one must accept certain standards.(ii $\bar { \mathcal { W } } e$ is uscd in similar fashion but nore concretely,implying a particular group of individuals with which the speaker wishes to idcntify himself, as in we don't do that sort of thing here. In addition there arc various other intermediate uscs of we: royal and cditorial eg we consider it our duty . with an assumption of status behind it; medical we, from doctor to patient as in how are we today?,implying you in your role as paticnt, with whom I seck to identify myself' impersonal we used in expository writing (for examplc in this book),cgwe conclude therefore that ..., simply because English demands a subject and an cxcess of passives soon bccomes tiresome. (ii They is used to mean persons unspecified' often those with responsibility, the authoritics, but also simply persons adequately specified for purposes of discussion by the contextas in they re nending the road out there.(iv) It occurs as a universal mctcorological opcrator in a few expressions such as it's suowing,it's hot today. All these arc exophoric, but with a kind of institutionalized cxophora; they make it possible to conform to the structural rcquirements of the clausc, which demands a nominal in various places - for this reason they arc oftcn untranslatable,since other languages make different requirements.

Exophoric reference makcs no contribution to thc cohesion of a text. But it is worth noting,pcrhaps, that this institutionalized exophora makes no demands either on thc verbal context or on the context of situation.Confronted with thc old verse

# 2:2o] They're digging up Grandpa's gravc to build a sewer

the hearer does not feel obligcd to ask Who are-the message is complete. If a pcrsonal form cannot bc intcrpreted institutionally,either becausc it docs not makc scnse in the context or becausc it is one such as he which is never used in this way,thcn the hcarcr must scck the necessary cvidence for interpreting it.If he finds such evidcnce in thc situation, he can accept the passage in question as a complete text. If not, he has to scek textual evidence, and thcreforc to assumc that the original passagc is related to some preceding picce by cohesion - otherwise, hc can only rcgard it as incomplete. It is not suggcstcd that hc performs these opcrations as a systcmatic search in this or any other ordcr.The important fact is that thc hearer typically assumes that any passage which for external reasons ouGHt to be a text as opposed to something that he knows to be a fragment, such as one cnd of a telephonc conversation) is in fact a text; and he will go to cnormous lengths to interpret it as complete and intelligible. This is an aspect of the very gencral human tendency to assume in the othcr person an intcntion to communicate, an assumption which is no doubt of very great valuc for survival.

# 2.3.4 Personal pronouns possessive determiners and possessive pronouns

All that has bccn said about the personal pronouns applics cqually to the other two catcgories of personal, namely the possessive dctcrminers and possessive pronouns.Ncither the syntactic function of the pcrsonal itself, nor the syntactic function of its referent,has any bearing on the anaphoric relation betwecn the two;in this respect reference is quite unlike substitution Chapter 3.In [2:21] below,the personal rcfcrence item he is a pronoun functioning as Hcad;this refers back to John cqually well whcther John is non-posscssive proper noun as Head as in (a)possessive as Dcictic as in bor possessive as Head as inc

[2:21 a. John has moved to a new housc. b.John's house is beautiful. He had it built last year. c.That new house is John's.

Likewise the other personal forms,both possessive determincrsmy,your, ctc) and possessive pronouns mine,yours,etc)may refer without restriction to a referent having any of thc functions of Joln in [2:21],or indeed any other syntactic function that is open to nominals. So we could have any combination of thc following:

2:22a. John has movcd to a x.Hc had it built last ycar. new house. b.John's house is bcautiful.Xy.His wife must bc dclighted with it. c.Thatnew houseis John's. z. I didn't know it was his.

where $\left( \mathrm { x } \right)$ has personal pronoun he,(y) has possessive determiner his and $( z )$ has possessive pronoun his.

Moreovcr the referent may be embedded deep in a complex sentence; there is still no difficulty in dentifying John as the refercnt of his in [2:23]:

2:23 You really ought to ask Sally not to tell a story like that to all thosc fricnds of hers if she thinks thcy might be going to be working with John, unless shc can bc quite surc it's not going to go any furthcr. I hardly think it would appcal to his sense of humour.

There is however onc respect in which possessive pronouns differ from other personal refcrcncc itcms as regards thcir anaphoric function.Whereas the other pcrsonals requirc only onc rcfercnt for thcir intcrpretation, possessive pronouns demand two,a possessor and a posscssed.The difference can be seen in [2:24]:

[2:24] a. John's is nice. b.His housc is nice. c.His is nicc.

Givena),we need the answer toJohn's what?'givenb)the answer to whose house?'but given c) we need the answer to'whose what?'.So any occurrence of a posscssivc pronoun involves two tics,only one of which is a form of rcference; thc othcr is prescnt with any possessive nominal, such as John's or y father's, whenever it is functioning as Hcad. This is in fact an instance of ellipsis (Chapter 4).Posscssive pronouns,in othcr words, are doubly anaphoric because they arc both referential and clliptical: thcy are anaphoric i by referencc, to the possessor,and ii) by cllipsis,to the thing posscsscd.So in [2:2s] only c) satisfics the presuppositions of the second sentence:

[2:25] a. Can you find another programme? b.Can you help Mary? Hers has got lost. c.Can you hand Mary a programme?

The possessive pronoun lers prcsupposes Mary by refercnce and programme by ellipsis.

# 2.3.5 Cataphoric reference

So far no mention has becn made of cataphoric personal refcrcnce.Personals can refer cataphorically,as in

2:26 He who hesitates is lost.

where he does not presupposc any referent in thc prcceding text but simply refers forward to who hesitates. Unlike demonstratives, however, which do refer cataphorically in a way that is genuinely cohesive-they rcfer ForwArD to succeeding elements to which they are in no way structurally related scc 2.4 below-personals are normally cataphoric only within a structural framework,and thereforc do not contribute to the cohesion of the text.The reference is within the sentence, and is dctcrmined by the structurc of the sentence.

It may be hclpful nevertheless to summarize the cataphoric structural functions of the personal forms - in which only thc pcrsonal pronouns participate, never the possessive forms. (i) Third person pronouns othcr than it may refcr cataphorically to a defining relativc clause, as in [2:26]. This usage is felt to be somewhat archaic; it is found in proverbs and aphorisms, and in some rhctorical, literary and liturgical styles.Such cataphoric reference is also found occasionally with we and you,as in you who doubt my word mcaning those among you who doubt my word';notc that there is no cataphora in forms which arc non-defining such as you, who used to be so tolerant).(ii) All third pcrson pronouns occur cataphorically as 'substitute themes'in clauscs in which thcir referent is delayed to thc cnd eg: theyre good these peaches.(iii) As a spccial case of the lastit is very frequcntly used in this way whcre the subject of thc clause is a nominalization as in it's true that he works very hard.This is in fact the unmarkcd or typical form in such cascs; the altcrnative, that he works very hard is true,is possible but restrictcd. All such cataphoric refercnce is structurally dctermined and inakes no direct contribution to the texture.

There is one cataphoric use of it that is cohesivc, illustrated by [2:27]:

[2:27] I would ncvcr havc bclieved it. They've accepted the wholc scheme.

This happens only where it is text-rcferring scc 2.3.3 above);againlikc its anaphoric cquivalent, it has more in common with demonstrative reference than with personal reference.

Thus, to sum up, not all occurrences of personal forns are anaphoric, nor is the mcrc presence of a personal reference item by itsclf an indication of a cohesive tie. In the first place, the referencc may be exophoric, interpretable by recoursc to the context of situation: cither in thc gcncralized exophoric sense of we, you they or it, or in the spccial exophoric scnsc of the speech roles exprcssed by you and I.Exophoric reference does not constitute a cohesive tic. In the second placc,it may be cataphoric; it will then bc cohesive only in thc case of thc spccial use of it cxemplified by $\left\{ 2 : 2 7 \right\}$ abovc.This docs constitutc a tic, linking up with what follows. All other instances are anaphoric, including most occurrences of third person forms and somc occurrences of first and second person forms thosc in a context of quotation).Usually there is no great difficulty in recognizing an anaphoric personal form; and we are all scnsitized to the presencc of one which seems to be anaphoric but for which no clear reference is available. Perhaps this is one of the reasons why children used to be discouragcd from using them.The othcr rcason is one of manncrs:'It's rude to point'and exophoric refcrcncc is, after all, just pointing with words.

# 2.4Demonstrative reference

Demonstrative reference is csscntially a form of vcrbal pointing. The spcaker identifies the referent by locating it on a scalc of proximity.The system is as follows:

![](img/94b829875e2ab41a14b3c110862cb4879369e032a3426560378ff3c9212f299b.jpg)

The circumstantial adverbial demonstratives here, there now and then refer to thc location of a proccss in space or time,and thcy normally do so directly,not via the location of some person or object that is participating in the proccss;hence thcy typically funetion as Adjuncts in thc clause, not as elemcnts within thc nominal groupThcy havc a secondary function as Qualifier,as in that man there. Thc remaining nominal dcmonstratives this these thatthose and the rcfer to thc location of somc thing typically some entity-person or object-that is participating in the process; they thereforc occur as clemcnts within the nominal group.They belong to the class of dctcrminers,and havc the cxpericntial function of Deicticin the logical structure they function eithcr as Modificr or as Head, with the exception of the which is a Modificr only.In this rcspect thc nominal demonstratives rcsemblc thc possessiveswhich can also function cithcr as Modificr or as Head, althoughunlike the possessives, thc demonstratives have only one form- thcre is no distinction between demonstrative determiner and demonstrative pronoun corrcsponding to that between possessive determiner (eg:your and posscssive pronoun egyours:

as Modificr as Head demonstrative that garden seems bigger that is a big garden possessive your garden scems bigger yours is a big garden

In the case of the demonstratives, howcver,therc arc certain differences in meaning between the functions of Modifier and Head; a dcmonstrative functioning as Head is more like a personal pronoun.Historically, in fact, both it and the are reduced forms of that and, although it now operates in the system of personals, both can be explained as being the 'neutral' or non-selectivc type of the nominal demonstrative -as essentially one and the same elemcnt, which takes the form it when functioning as Head and the when functioning as Deictic (see further 2.4.2 below).

Like personals, the demonstratives regularly refer exophorically tosomething within the context of situation.This is the prinary form of vcrbal pointing; and it may be accompanied by demonstrative action, in the form of a gesture indicating the object referred to. Examples are obvious enough:

[2:28] Pick thesc up! [2:29] How would you like a cruisc in that yacht?

Similarly with the demonstrative adverbs:

[2:3o Leave that there and come here

In general this these and here imply proximity to thc spcaker; that those and there imply distancc from the spcakcr, which may or may not involve proximity to the addressee- the meaning is near you,or not near either of us, but at any rate not near me'Many languages, for example Japanese, have a set of three demonstratives in which thc meanings near you'and not near eithcr of us'are kept distinct;this systcm is found in one or two dialccts of English which have this here near methat there near you and yon yonder not near cithcr of us.In such languages thcrc is a close parallelism between the dcmonstrative and the personal systcms, with this'corresponding to'I'spcakcr)'that'to  you'addressee),and yon to hc,she,it'other location or rolc).\* In languages like Standard English, with only thc two terms,this is morc specific than thatsince thishas thc spcaker as its point of referencc while that'has no particular reference point -it is simply intcrpreted as not this.This explains why the neutral forms the and it derived from that and not from this.

We are not concerned hcre with exophoric rcference,for thc rcasons already givcn:it is not textually cohesive.But thc uscs of this and that in endophoric reference are explainable by referencc to thcir exophoric meanings;so it is important to start from the general concept of proximity as this is interprcted situationally.The samc applies to the dcfinite article: the is also uscd cxophorically,where thc situation makes it clear what referent is intended,as in

[2:31 Look at thc flowers [2:32] Don't go;the train's coming.

This is the meaning of the herc:namely that the rcferent is fully specified by the context and no further spccification is needed.The anaphoric and cataphoric uses of the are likewisc morc rcadily interpretablc if we relate them to its mcaning as an exophoric dcictic.

Dcmonstrative refercnce is discussed in more detail in the ncxt threc sections:2.4.1the selectivc nominal demonstratives2.4.2the;2.43,the adverbial demonstratives.

2.4.1 The selective nominal demonstratives: this, thesc, that, those

Thcse demonstratives occur extensively with anaphoric function in all varictics of English. In principlc they embody within thcmselves thrce systcmatic distinctions:

1betweenncarthisthese and not ncarthat,those) (2betweensingular'thisthat and pluralthese, those 3between Modifier this etc plus noun eg: this tree is an oak and Head (this ctc, without nouneg this is an oak.

All these distinctions have somc relevance to cohesion, in that they parti ally determinc thc use of these itcms in endophoric (textual) reference. They are discussed in the next thrce subsections.

2.4.I.I NEAR AND NOT NEAR: this/these VERSUS that/those

Both this and that regularly refer anaphorically to something that has bcen said before. In dialogue thcre is somc tcndency for the speakcr to use this to refer to something he himself has said and that to refer to something said by his interlocutor;conparc [2:33] and [2:34]:

[2:33] a.There seems to havc bccn a great deal of sheer carclessness. This is what I can't undcrstand. b.There seems to have becn a great deal of sheer carelessness. Yes, that's what I can't understand.

This distinction is clearly relatcd to that of'near (the speaker)'versus not nearwhat I have just mentionedis, textually speaking,near me whercas'what you have just mentioned'is not.The tendcncy seems to be furthcr rcinforced if the referent is also in some way AssocrAreD wirh the speaker;for examplc,

[2:34] I likc the lions and I like the polar bcars.These arc my favourites. -Those are my favourites too.

Here there are as it werc two kinds of proximity: the lions and the polar bcars have not only becn mentioned by thc spcaker but also explicitly linked to his personal feclings, so that he naturally refers to them as these.

Co-existing with this tendency is another one whcrcby proximity is interpreted in terns of time;in this case that tends to bc associated with a past-time rcferent and this for one in the present or futurc. For examplc, [2:35] a.We went to the opera last night.That was our first outing for months. b.We're going to the opera tonight. This'll be our first outing for months.

Comparc this with the cxophoric usc of this to rcfer to current periods of time:this morningthis year and so onand also in those days in these days.

Neither of these tendencics is fully dominant. If in a given instance both are working in thc same dircction, the choicc is likely to follow the expected pattern;for cxamplc

[2:36] I couldn't afford to learn it, said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. I only took thc rcgular course. What was that?'inquired Alice.

Here Alice could hardly have said What was this? Similarly with [2:37] [2:37 a. What about this exhibition b.What about that exhibition?

If we hear [2:37a] we are likcly to supply something likc that I told you is on now;shall we go and see itwhereas with [2:37b] thc presupposition is morc likely to be that you told me was on carlier; did you go and see it?'- at lcast, it could not be the other way round. But the criteria may conflict,precisely because the notion of proximity has various interpretations; and in such cases therc is no very clearly felt distinction between this and that.In [2:38] we could casily substitute that

[2:38] But then Mr.Dubois reflected gloomily women never had any prudence.Though he had profited by this lack many a time, it annoyed him now.

In any case thcrc are markcd differences among different styles and varietics of English as regards their patterns of anaphoric usage of this and thiat the study of which gocs beyond our prcscnt scope. For examplc, in narrative of a traditional kind,such as childrcn's stories and ballads, we often find that where,in conversational narrative,a speaker would tend to use this, conveying a sense of immediacy and also of solidarity with the hcarer, of shared interest and attention. So the ballad of the thrce little pigs has

[2:39] And after a time those little pigs died.

whcrcas if we were recounting the incident we should probably say these little pigs. It is this assumption of shared interest and attcntion which lies behind the use of thc'near'forms,this and these,in conversational narrative where thcy are not strictly phoric' at all:There was this nan..wherc this man'is prescnt ncither in the text nor in thc situation but only in thc speaker's mind. The context is onc of highly coded, in-group speech, and the effcct is to emphasize common cxperiencc and a common interest.

2.4.I.2 SINGULAR AND PLURAI: thisthat VERSUS thesethose

In general this distinction follows the expected pattcrn: this/that refer to count singular or mass nouns, these/those to count plural.Thc most important differcncc is that which separates the sINGUL AR FORMs USED AS HEAD ie: this and that without following noun from thc restthis will bc discussed in 2.4.1.3 below.

Otherwise, we may notc simply that the plural forms may refer anaphorically not merely to a preceding plural noun, as in 2:39],but also to sets that are plural in meaning,for example

[2:40]Whcre do you come from?'said the Red Queen.And where are you going? Look up, speak niccly, and don't twiddle your fingers all the time. Alicc attended to all thesc directions, and cxplained,as well as She could,that she had lost her way.

Converscly the singular demonstrative may refer to a whole list irrespcctivc of whcther or not it contains items that arc thcmsclves plural:

[2:41 I've ordered two turkeys,a lcg of lamb, somc cooked ham and tongue,and two pounds of minced beef.- Whatcver are you going to do with all that food?

But these uscs follow from the gencral nature of anaphoric reference items, that they refer to the meanings and not to the forms that have gone before.

2.4.I.3 HEAD AND MODIFIER: tisETC, AS PRONOUN VERSUS this ETC PLUS FOLLOWING NOUN

A demonstrativc as Modifier\`dcmonstrativc adjcctive) may refer without restriction to any class of noun.A dcmonstrativc as Head (demonstrative pronoun), on the other hand while it can refer frccly to non-humans, is highly rcstricted in its refcrcnce to human nouns; it cannot refer to a human refcrent cxcept in thc spccial environment of an equative clause.For example,in

[2:42] Now the clevcrcst thing I ever did'thc Knight went on after a pause,was inventing a new pudding during thc mcat-course. ..I don't belicve that pudding ever was cooked.

it would bc perfectly possible to omit the sccond pudding and say I don't believe that ever was cookedf[2:40] and 2:41].On the other hand,in

[2:43] I must introduce you to the surgeon who lookcd after me when I was in hospital. That surgeon really did a finc job, and nothing was too much trouble for him.

we could not replace that surgeon by that.The only instancc whcrc demonstratives can refer pronominally to human refercnts,whether anaphorically or exophorically, is in rclational clauscs of thc cquative type wherc one elemcnt is supplying thc idcntification of thc others, for exanplc

[2:44] a.Do you want to know the woman who designed it?That was Mary Smith. b.Who are those colourful characters?-Thosc must bc thc presidential guards.

Comparc the exophoric Who's that?this is John whcn introducing him), those are the people I was telling you aboutbut nevcr let's ask thisI don't know wat that's laughing about.Thc principle is that the demonstrative pronoun corresponds to it and not to he or she.The fact that thc plural form they is the samc for both human and non-human referents may explain why thc demonstrative is slightly less unacceptablc with a human referent when it is in the plural; wc might pcrhaps accept lets ask these I don't know what those are langhing about.

There is one other important characteristic of demonstrative reference that is specifically a feature of demonstratives functioning as Head.This concerns the level of generality of the rcferent.

If the demonstrativc is used with a noun, then thc mcaning is always identical with that of thc prcsupposcd itcm.Examples arc [2:39], [2:42] and [2:43].This normally holds true cven if thc noun following the demonstrative is not identical with the presupposcd item;it may be some kind of a synonym, like food in [2:41]which is a SUPERORDINA TE ie a morc gcneral tcrm)or likc directions in [2:4o]There is still identity of reference in such instances;it is that particular foodthose particular directions'. Thcsc are in fact differcnt types of lexical cohesion, and are discussed furthcr in Chapter 6.To invent onc further cxample, in [2:45] it docs not matter whether we havc cat or anial or trickster in thc second sentence; the reference is still to the original cat:

[2:45] There's a cat trying to get in,shall I open the window\~ Ohthat cat/that animal / that trickstcr's always coning here cadging.

Suppose however that we use the denonstrative alone, without a following noun.The reference may still be identical; but it may be broader, refcrring to thc general class denoted by the noun, including but not limited to thc particular member or mcmbers of that class being refcrred to in the presupposed item.If for example the first sentence in [2:4s] had begun There are two cats trying to get inthen the answer those cats would still have referred only to thc original two cats but the answer those,eg:Those have to be kept out could rcfer not just to the two cats mentioned but to cats in general.Compare:

[2:46] There's been another big industrial merger.It sccms that nothing can be done about this.

where the mcaning is not 'this particular merger'but'mergcrs in gcneral', as we can scc by substituting this merger, or this one, for this.A rclated instance is provided by [2:47]:

[2:47 His hand groped for the knife.If he could only reach that he would be safe.

Herc wc could, in factsubstitute that knifebut not that onethe mcaning is not 'that particular knife'but that particular object, namely thc knife This affords a very good illustration of the difference between refcrence and substitution, as summarized at the beginning of Chapter 3 below.In the plural, the distinction is less clearcut, and there is the possibility of ambiguity:

[2:48] How did you like the recitations? I find those boring.

If it had bcen I found, the meaning would have been 'those particular recitations'and we could have substituted those recitations or those ones.\* I findhowcvcr, suggests those particular things, namely recitations in generalherc wc could ccrtainly not substitutc those ones, but it would perhaps be possible to substitute those recitations and still interpret it in this sense. In a comparable way, given there are two cats trying to get in the answer those creatures have to be kept out is ambiguous as between those particular cats'and those particular creatures, namely cats in general.

Thc gencral principle bchind this is simply that demonstratives, since $\star$ In most varieties of written Englishand with somc speakcrsthese ones and rhose ones do not occur: but there is a growing tendency to use these forms in speech preciscly in order to make this distincrion in mcaningto givc another exampleDo you like y hydrangeas-YesI like thosehydrangeas in generalcontrasted with YesI like hose onesthose particular hydrangeas.The form with ones) is very often used exophoricallythough not exclusively so.Wc arc now beginning to hear my onesyour ones ctc in place of ineyorsetc although here the distinction is unnecessary because the latter occur only in the second, particularized sense. Scc3.2bclow.

(like othcr rcference items) they identify semantically and not grammatically, whcn they are anaphoric require the explicit repetition of the noun, or some form of synonym, if thcy are to signal cxact identity of specific reference;that is, to refer unambiguously to the presupposed item at thc identical dcgrce of particularization.A dcmonstrative without a following noun may refcr to some more gcncral class that includes the presupposed itcms; and this also applies under certain conditions to a demonstrativc with a following noun-namely if the context is such that the noun can be INTERPRETeD more gcnerally. It is not casy to specify cxactly what thesc conditions arc, but thcy are morc likely to obtain with plural or mass nouns bccause these are gencral unless specificd. In spoken English thcrc is a one-way phonological distinction: the demonstratives have a wcakcncd form that is used ONry when they are Nor spccifying and the meaning is one of generalized reference; for cxample

[2:49] How did you managc with the new drugs I gave you? (i $/ / c$ those/new/drugs up/set me/ i/ those/new/drugs up/set me//

Here (i) is ambiguous: it might mcan either thc particular ones you gave mc'ornew drugs in gcncral;whereas ii) can mean only 'new drugs in general'.The gcncralizcd typc is typically associated with expressions of attitudc,for example I don't trust these lawyerslawyers in general)those French are so touchy notc that in thc particularized sense it would have to be those French people) and also that Bach had genius meaning not J.S. as opposed to thc rest of the familybut Bach,that we all know'.All these are simply cquivalent to non-specific forms new drugs lawyers the French and Bach) to which a demonstrative has been added, oftcn for anaphoric purposes but without carrying over any specificity thcrc may have becn in the item that is presupposed.

Thc distinction between the particular use of a demonstrative, having cxact identity of reference with the presupposed item, and thc gencralized use is related to that between defining and non-dcfining modifiers. In that Bahthar is non-definingbut if we changc to it that fellow Bach it becomes defining. Similarly if wc interprct that in [2.47] as 'that knife'it is nondefining,but if we interprct,it as that thing it is defining.Compare rhis in

[2.50] They wept like anything to scc Such quantities of sand. If this were only swept away, They said,it would be grand -this sand.or this stuff'.Thc distinction does nothowcver,affect the textual function of demonstratives,since both uses are cqually associated with anaphoric rcference, and hcnce contribute to cohesion within thc text.

2.4.I.4 EXTENDED REFERENCE AND REFERENCE TO FACT this AND that Related to the last,gencralized type of demonstrative reference, but at the same time quite distinct from it, is the usc of dcmonstratives to rcfer to extended text including text asfact'cf:it in 2.3.3.I abovc).This applies only to the singular forms this and that used without a following noun.For example:

[2:51 They broke a Chinese vase. i That was valuable. iiThat was carcless.

In i that rcfcrs to the object vasewc could have that vase instcad. In ii) that refers to the total event,their breaking of the vase'If there had been more than one breakage wc could have had those were valuable but not those were careless:

[2:52 They brokc a Chinese vasc and damaged two chandeliers. Those were all very valuablc. ii That was all very careless.\*

Extended refcrence probably accounts for the majority of all instances of demonstratives in all except a few specialized varieties of English.For example, in the last two chapters of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland there are 51 demonstratives,made up of 22 this,24 that,3 these and 2 those.Of the total, 31 are used in extended reference.Ofthc remaining 20,3 refer to timc, which is another form of extended referencc,g [2:53a]),1o are exophoric in thc dialogue (eg [2:53b]) and $S$ are anaphoric to preceding nominals $( e g [ 2 : 5 3 { \mathsf { c } } ] )$ ..

[2:53] a. Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation. b.Treacle' said a sleepy voice behind her.'Collar that Dormouse' thc Quccn shrieked out. c.One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This, of course, Alice could not stand..

Two instances are unclassifiable before she had this fit,in thc verses read out by the White Rabbit and repeated by the King).Examples of extended reference arc:

[2:54] a.'Give your cvidence,said the Kingand don't be nervous,or I'll havc you cxecuted on the spot. This did not secm to encourage the witness at all. b.But what did the Dormouse say'one of the jury asked. 'That I can't remember,'said the Hatter. c.I gave her one, they gave him two-why,that must be what he did with the tarts, you know.

It is not always easy to say whether the referent of a demonstrative in a given instance is a particular nominal item in the text or should be taken to include something more;the this in [2:53c could be supposed to refer to the whole of the preceding sentencc.The distinction is not a sharp onc, and it is usually irrelevant; in either case thc cffect is cohesive.But in many instances the referent clearly is an extended passage of text, and this, together with the related use of it, is one of the major cohesivc devices of the English language.

Perhaps the most frequent form taken by such extended refercnce is in equative clauses where the demonstrativc provides the given'clcment in the mcssage and this then serves to identify some other element that is newby simply being cquated with it.[2:54c] is onc cxample;here are some others:

[2:5s a. [following thc White Rabbit's reading of thc verses That's the most important piece of evidcncc we've hcard yet,said the King, rubbing his hands. b.I come from Wolvcrhampton.-That's where I come from too. c.No onc will take it seriously.This is the frightening thing.

Spoken English is typically held together by internal cross-referencing of this kind, which combincs powerful structure with great fexibility and freedom of movement.

# 2.4.I.5 ANAPHORIC AND CATAPHORIC DEMONSTRATIVES

There is diffcrentiation bctwecn this and that in extendcd text reference which rclates to their diffcrentiation in tcrms of proximity.Whereas that is always anaphoric, this may be either anaphoric or cataphoric. Some Shakespearean examples:

[2:56] a. Viola:I am all thc daughtcrs of my father's house And all the brothers too- and yet I know not. Sir, shall I to this lady? Duke:Ay, that's thc theme. b.Hamlet: Do not look upon me Lest with this piteous action you convert My stern effects: then what I have to do Will want true colour; tears pcrchance for blood. Queen: To whom do you speak this? Hamlet: Do you scc nothing there? Queen:Nothing at all; yet all that is I see. Hamlet: Nor did you nothing hcar? Queen: No, nothing but oursclves. Hamlet: Why, look you thcrc! look, how it steals away! My fathcr, in his habit as he livd Look, where he goes, even now, out of the portal! Qucen: This is the very,coinage of your brain. c.Cassius: That you have wronged me doth appear in this: You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella For taking bribes hcrc of the Sardians; Wherein my letters, praying on his side, Because I knew the man, were slighted off.

[2:56a] has anaphoric thatb three instances of anaphoric this and c) cataphoric this.

This use of this togcther with the parallel usc of here see 2.4.3 below)is the only significant instance of cataphoric cohesion in English. We have distinguished this,in thc previous discussion,from structural cataphora as in he who hesitates; structural cataphora is very common,cspccially with the dcfinite article (see 2.4.2 below),but it is simply a realization of a grammatical relationship within the nominal group and has no cohesive, textforming function. Textual cataphora, by contrast,is truc reference forward in the text;it thercfore is cohesive, not by picking up what has prcceded but by anticipating what is to follow.From Alice:

[2:57]These were the verses the White Rabbit read:-[followed by the verses]

In writingscntences which arc rclated cataphorically are often joined by a colon; but there is no structural relation between the two-this is a purely orthographic convention, serving precisely to signal the presence of cataphoric cohesion.

A final point to notc is that in spoken English this and that in cxtcnded referencc often carry the tonic (primary stress). In this thcy arc unlikc all other cohesive itens in the languagc. Sincc, in thc most general tcrms, tonicity is associated with information that is ncw, it is not surprising to find that anaphoric items,which by definition arc notnewbecause they are referring to what has gonc bcfore, do not normally carry the tonic. The position is quite different with reference items used exophorically these are often tonic- again, not surprisingly, since in this case the referent has not been mentioncd beforc.) We can be quite precise about anaphoric items: they are tonic when and only when they are contrastive, and this is part of the samc story.The semantic category ofncw' means information being treated by the speaker as non-recoverable to thc hearer; it may be non-recovcrable either because it has not been prcviously mcntioncd or becausc it has been previously mentioncd but is uncxpected and hence contrastive in thc particular context.For cxamplc, in [2:58] these is new in this sccond, contrastive sense:

[2:58] The first row of cottages looked empty and decrepit.But behind them stood another row, well kcpt and with small bright gardens. Whoever lived in these cottages livcd well enough.

A demonstrative with textual reference, however, is vcry frequently tonic; and this ariscs in two ways,both of which are simply extensions of the principle mentioned above, that tonicity signals what is new. In the first place there arc very many instances in which thc reference, while anaphoric, Is in fact contrastive, this being the whole point of the utterance; for cxample

[2:59] Where are you going? -To fecd the fish. THAr's what I was trying to remember to do just now.

In the second place, the reference may be cataphoric, in which case the referent has not been mentioned before; a cataphoric demonstrative is therefore rcgularly tonic.Contrast [2:6oa],where this is anaphoric, meaningwhat I've just saidwith [2:6ob] whcre it is cataphoric, and means what I'm just going to say

[2:60] a. I can't gct any reliable INFORMATION.This is what wORRIEs mc. b.THIs is what worrics mc:I can't get any reliable INFORMATION.

In 2:6oa] this could be replaced by thatwhcreas in [2:6ob] it could not. As a corollary of its carrying the tonic, thc cataphoric this could cqually come at the end: in b wc might well have What worries me is thiswhereas in (a) such a reversal is highly improbable.

# 2.4.2The

The definite article the has usually becn sct apart, in grammars of English, as a unique mcmber of a class, its only rclative being the indefinite article a. Therc is somc justification for this; no othcr item in English behaves cxactly likc the.On the other hand, it has important similarities with a whole group of other items, so that we necd not hesitatc to classify it with thc determincrs;and,more particularly,with thc specific dctcrminers, the class which includes the dcmonstratives and the possessives.(Likewisc the indefinitc article is a membcr of thc wider class of non-specific dctcrminers.) The full set of specific deternincrs is as follows:

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Demonstrative</td><td>Possessive</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Referential</td><td>(this that Sclective these those</td><td>Specch roles my your, our</td></tr><tr><td>Non-sclective the</td><td>his, hertheir Other rolesits (one&#x27;s</td></tr><tr><td>Interrogative</td><td>which</td><td rowspan="2">whose</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

Hencc the in inany ways resembles the demonstratives,from one form of which it is derivcd. It is originally a reduced form of that functioning only as a modifiet, in the same way that a is a reduccd form of one likcwise restrictcd to the modifier function. And this is reflccted in its meaning.Essentially the,like the demonstratives is a specifying agcntscrving to identify a particular individual or subclass within the class designated by the noun;but it does this only through depcndcnce on somcthing elseit contains no specifying clcment of its own.

This can be explained as follows. All other specific detcrminers arc semantically sclectivc; thcy contain within themselves somc referential element in tcrms of which thc item in question is to be idcntified.With the possessives, it is person: thc itcm is idcntified as bclonging to, or associated with,a recognizable participant-spcakcr, addrcsscc or some pcrson or object in the environment. With thc dcmonstrativcs, it is proximity: thc item is idcntificd as present in the environment and morc, or Iess, remotc. In both thesc instances thc cnvironment, as we have seen, may bc situational or tcxtual; and when it is textual, this form of specification by rcference becomes cohesive.

Thc dcfinite article has no content. It merely indicates that thc itcm in question is specific and identifiable; that somewhere the information necessary for idcntifying it is recoverablc.Where is this information to be sought?Again, cither in thc situation or in thc text.Thc rcfercnce is either cxophoric or endophoric.If it is cxophoric,thc itcm is identifiable in one of two ways.1) A particular individual or subclass is bcing referred to, and that individual or subclass is identifiable in thc spccific situation. An cxample was [2:32]Don't go;the train's coming,wherc the train is intcrpreted asthe train wc'rc both cxpecting-contrasted with Don't go; a train's coning which would perhaps be a warning to avoid being run over.All immcdiate situational instanccs of the arc cxophoric in this way: nind the step;pass me the towel; the children are enjoying themselves; the snow's toc deep;the journeys nearly over and so on.2 The referent is identifiable on extralinguistic grounds no matter what the situation.This has somcthing in common with the gencralized exophoric usc of thc personal forms,and it occurs undcr two conditions.It may arisc, first, because thcrc cxisis only one member of the class of objects referrcd to, for exanple the sun or, at lcast, one member which will be assumcd in the absence of specific indication to the contrary, for examplc the baby our baby)the government of our countrythe tine now.Secondlyit may arise because the referencc is thc wholc class, eg:the stars;or thc individual considered as a representativc of the whole class like the child in As the child grows he learns to be independentor the snail in The snail is considered a great delicacy in this region.This type of cxophoric reference,which does not depend on the specific situation,has been called HomopHORic to distinguish it from the situationally specific type.

Alternatively,thc source of idcntification may lic in the text:what we are calling endophoric reference.In this case therc are again two possibilities: reference forward, and reference backward.(3) Cataphoric or forward reference,with the, is limited to the structural typc.Unlike the selcctive demonstratives this,these and here),the can never refcr forward cohesively. It can only rcfer to a modifying elcment within the same nominal group as itself.Here arc some examples:

[2:61] a. The ascent of Mount Everest b.The party in power c.The people who predicted a dry summcr d.The longest stretch c.The best way to achicvc stability

What is thc significance of the in such instances?It is, as always, a signal of identity or rather, of identifiability, showing that criteria for idcntifying wHIch ascent,wHich party etc is intended are recoverable-in this instance, they are recoverable from the nominal group in which the the occurs. In other words the is a signal that the modifying elements are to be taken as defining:we arc to understand only such members of the general class named by the Hcad noun as arc specified in the Modifier.The defining elements are of Mount Everest, in power, who predicted a dry summer,longest, and,in (e), the discontinuous Modificr best...to achieve stability.

4 Finally there is anaphoric refcrcncc, the only one of the four conditions in which the is cohesive.Thc clearest instances of this are those in which the item is actually repeated,eg:hall in

[2:62 She found herself in a long, low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.Thcre were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked.

Often the reference is to a synonym or near-synonym, or to some other item which by its connotations provides a targct for the anaphora;in [2:63], the eyes arc clearly those of the Cat and note the lexical cohesion between eyes and mouth):

2:63 'How are you getting on?'said thc Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.Alice waited till the cyes appeared,and then nodded.

This shades into the sort of extended reference and text rcference that we have found with it,this and thatfor example the prospect in

2:64] A nicc mess wcre all in. Pictures in the papers and reporters coming round.'Shc pauscd, obviously visualizing the futurc in a serics of crudc,highly-colourcd pictures.Hc thought that the prospcct was still not wholly unplcasing.\*

Once again, the signals identifiability; but here the information about WHICH hall,wHIcH eyes and wHIcH prospect is to bc rccovcrcd from thc prcceding text.This is what provides the 'texture'.

Thcrc is a commonly hcld belicf that thc typical function of the is the anaphoric onc: that it invariably specifies by reference back in the text. Indeed it has sometimes been referred to as the'second mention article.It should be stressed, therefore, that anaphoric referencc is only one means whereby the achieves specificity and even when it is anaphoric, more often than not therc is nosecond mentionof thc same noun.It is probably true that purcly anaphoric refcrencc never accounts for a majority of instances: in pragmatic spcech the is primarily cxophoric, and in most other varieties of spokcn and written English its predoninant function is cataphoric.What must bc rccognized, however, is that these various types of rcference are not mutually exclusive.A given occurrence of the might havc any two or even three functions at the same time.

Consider for example:

[2:65] Last year we went to Devon for a holiday.The holiday we had there was the best wc've ever had.

Here the is both cataphoric, pointing forward to we lad there,and also anaphoric, referring the sccond occurrencc of holiday back to that in the preceding sentence; and it would be mcaningless to argue that it must be just the onc or the other.Now supposc the same cxample continues:

[2:65 cont'd)The people we stayed with had four childrcn. The eldest girl was about nine.

The first the is cataphoric only, since there is no lexical rclation betwecn people and anything in the prcceding passage.The sccond is again both cataphoric and anaphoric: cataphoric, showing that eldest dcfines girl, and anaphoric bccausc girl is related to children.We might evcn construct an cxample with all three types of reference:

[2:66 Look at thc moon The daytime moon always scems so sad.

Here the second occurrence of the is cataphoric to daytime, anaphoric to the earlier moon,and exophoric both in thehomophoric'sense,since there is only one moon, and also in thc situational sensc since it is specifically an object of attention.Such instances of fourfold refcrcncc are presumably fairly rarc.

The function of the definitc article can bc summed up by saying that it is an unmarked or non-selective rcferential dcictic.Its mcaning is that the noun it modifies has a spccific refcrent, and that the information required for identifying this refcrent is availablc. It does not contain that information in itself it is thc dcfinite articlc' in the sense that its function is to signal definiteness, without itself contributing to the definition.Nor does it say where the information is to bc locatcd. It will be found somewhcre in thc cnvironment,provided we intcrpret 'environment'in thc broadest sensc: to include the structure, the text, the situation and thc culture. Whcncver the information is contained in the text, the presence of the creatcs a link bctween the scntcnce in which it itsclf occurs and that containing the referential information;in othcr words,it is cohcsive.

# 2.4.3 Demonstrative adverbs

There are four of thcsc, here,there,now and thenalthough nowis very rarely cohesive.Three of thcm nccd to be distinguished from their homographsother words written the same way but now at leasthaving different functions in the language.(1)Demonstrative there is to be distinguished from pronoun there as in there's a an at the door.2Demonstrativc now is to be distinguishcd fron conjunction now as in now what we re going to do is this. 3Demonstrative then is to bc distinguishcd from conjunction then as in then youve gite ade up your mindAs a gcncral rule the non-demonstrative forms are phonologically reduccd,whereas the demonstratives arc not reduced, though there may be no phonological difference in the case of then.It is the demonstrativcs only with which we arc concerncd here.

As rcfcrcnce itcms, here and there closely parallel this and that, respectively.For cxample

[2:67] 'Do you play croquct with the Queen today? I should likc it vcry much'said Alice,'but I havcn't been invited' You'll scc mc there'said the Cat, and vanished.

The mcaning of there is anaphoric and locative; it rcfcrs to playing croquct with the Queen.Both here and there regularly rcfcr to extendcd text, and then often with a meaning that is not one of place but ofrespect':in this respectin that respect'.For example

[2:68] 'Of course it would be all thc bcttersaid Alicc: but it wouldn't be all the better his bcing punished. You're wrong there, at any rate, said thc Qucen.

In such contexts here, like this may be cataphoric; in cxamplc [2:33] this could bc replaced by here and that could be replaced by there.Thc demonstratives this, these and here provide,in fact, almost the only sources of cataphoric cohcsion: they are thc only itcms in English which regularly refer forward rexruALly, to somcthing to which they arc not linked by a structural rclationship.\*An example of thc cataphoric usc of comparatives, which is much rarer,will be found in the ncxt section.)

Thc temporal demonstratives then and now arc much more restrictcd in their cohesive function.The cohesive use of demonstrative then is that embodying anaphoric reference to timc; the meaning isat the time just referred to':

[2:69] In my young days we took these things more seriously, We had different ideas then.

Thc usc of now is confincd to those instances in which the neaning is this state of affairs having comc about for cxample [2:70a]; [2:70b] shows a comparablc usc of then:

[2:70] a.Thc planc touchcd down at last.Now we could breathe freely again. b.Why not tell your parents? Then wc can stop prctending.

This is already approaching the use of then as a conjunctive; sce 5.7 bclow.

# 2.4.4 A final note on demonstratives

There arc very many expressions containing a demonstrative that occur as adjuncts,typically at the beginning of a clause;in general thcy come within the category often known as discourse adjuncts.Examples arc in that casethat being so,after that,at this moment,under these circumstances.

In the present analysis,we arc trcating these as conjunctives,not as demonstratives;sec Chapter $5$ bclow.This is on scmantic grounds: thc principle is that any semantic rclation which is itself conjunctive is trcated as conjunctivc in all its realizations, whether or not there is a dcmonstrative or other reference item present in its expression. This also avoids making an awkward and artificial distinction between pairs of items such as as a result and as a result of this; both of these are interpreted in thc same way,as conjunctives.

In fact,there is ovcrlap betwccn conjunction and reference at this point, and there would bc no need in principlc to forcc a classification in terms of just one or the other.But one of thc purposes of thc present study is to make it easy to analyse and comparc texts in respcct of their cohesive properties; and for this reason, in all instances of indeterminacy we have takcn a decision one way or the other. As far as possible the decision has followed the line of semantic consistency, at the same time with an eyc to applicability in practice.

# 2.5Comparative reference

The table of comparative referencc itemns was given in 2.2 above (Table 4) The system is as follows:

By gcncral comparison'is meant comparison that is simply in tcrms of likencss and unlikeness, without respect to any particular property: two things may bc the same,similar or different (where different' includes both not the same and not similar).General comparison is expressed by a certain class of adjectives and adverbs (separated from cach other by a comma in the above lists). The adjcctives function in the nominal group eithcr as Deictic (eg: identical in the identical two cards) or as Epithet eg identical in two identical cards);it will be seen that these have different meanings (see 2.5.1 bclow).The adverbs function in the clause, as Adjunct (eg: identically in the others performed identically).These are callcd DJE crivES OF COMPARISON,ADVERBS OF COMPARISON,tO distinguish ther from COMPARA IIVE ADJECHIVES and COMPARATIVE ADVERBS, WhiCh are the comparative forms of ordinary adjcctives and adverbs, eg:bigger, betterfastermore quickly.

'Particular comparison'mcans comparison that is in respect of quantity or quality. It is also expressed by means of adjectives or adverbs;not of a special class, but ordinary adjectives and adverbs in some comparative forn. The adjectives function, as always, within the noininal group,but not as Deictic;they function either as Numerative (egmore in more cards) or as Epithet (eg:better in better cards).Thc adverbs function in either of two ways:cithcr as Adjunct in thc clausc eg:better in the others performed better) or as Submodifier, in which casc they simply occur within an Epithet (eg:such in such good cards, identically in an identically designed house) or a Numcrative (eg: so in so many words)or within an Adjunct (eg: equally in the others performed equally badly).It makes no difference whcther the comparativc adjective or adverb is inflected (eg:slower,slowlier) or compounded (eg:mnore lengthymore lengthily);the meaning and function are not affected by this distinction.

The same principles operate with comparison as with other forms of rcfercnce: it may be anaphoric, and thcrcfore cohesive, or it may be cataphoric or even exophoric.Only bricf illustrations will bc given of thc non-anaphoric uses.

General comparison is discussed in 2.5.I and particular comparison in 2.5.2.

# 2.5.1 General conparison

General comparison expresses likeness bctween things. The likeness may take the form of idcntity,where two thingsare, in fact,thc same thing, as in [2:7ia];or of similarity whcrc two things arc like cach other, as in [2:71b].Each of these has its negative; thcre is non-identity and nonsimilarity.But these two concepts are conflatcd, in thc semantic system, into a single mcaning, that of non-likeness, or diffcrcnce, as in [27ic].\* [2:71] a. Its the same cat as thc one wc saw ycstcrday. b.Its a similar cat to thc one we saw yesterday. c. It's a diffcrent cat from the one we saw yesterday.

Likcness is a referential propcrty.A thing cannot just be likc'it must be likc something'Hence comparison is a form of reference, alongside personal and dcmonstrative refcrcncc;and it cmbraces thc samc set of possibilities.The referent of thc comparison may bc in thc situation, or it may bc in thc text. If it is in the text, the reference may be backwards or forwards, and it may be structural or non-structural cohcsive).With comparison, however, there is onc further possibility: thc comparison may be internal-the likcncss expressed as tual likeness without a refercnt appearing as a distinct entity.

All the examples in [2:71] were cataphoric in the structural sense; in cach case the referent was the one we saw yesterday, and the comparatives same, similar and different were pointing forward to it in just the samc way that those points forward to who predicted an earthquake.Other examples:

[2:72] a.We havc received exactly the same report as was submitted two months ago. b. There arc other qualities than conviviality needed for this job. c.Find a number cqual to the squarc of the sum of its digits.

The referents arc [the one that was submitted two months agoconvivialityand the square of the sum of its digits.Such cataphoric reference is fully determined by the structure and therefore, as always, has no cohesive function.

Instances of cohesive cataphora, with comparatives, are not very common, but they do occur:

[2:73] The othcr squirrcls hunted up and down the nut bushes; but Nutkin gathered robin's pincushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of pine-necdlc pins.

Here other is cataphoric to Nutkin;although the two are separated only by a semicolon, thc cffcct is cohcsive, as thcy are not structurally related. Compare:

[2:74] Thc blow would havc knocked anyone clsc cold.Thc champ just leancd to one side, then straightened again.

Examples such as those in [2:75] might be cxophoric,the rcfcrent bcing rctricvable from the situation:

[2:75] a.I was expecting somcone different. b.Would you prefer the other seats?

thc first bcing intcrprcted as different from you' or different from that person thercthe second asother than those you scc here'.Either however night equally be anaphoric, givcn contexts such as:

[2:76] a.Jenningsis hcrc to sce you.-I was expecting somcone different b.They've given us special placcs in the front row.Would you prefer the other seats?

Another example of anaphoric comparison is [2:77],where such refers back to the nominal group qualifier of mildly but persistently depressive temperament:

[2:77]Gerald Middleton was a man of mildly but pcrsistently depressive temperament.Such mcn arc not at thcir bcst at breakfast.\*

Againas with other typcs of refcrencc, the referent may bc a passage of any cxtcnteg:so in[2:78a] and such in [2:78b]:

[2:78 a.Everybody says Comc inhere' thought Alice, as she went slowly after thc Gryphon:I ncver was so ordered about in all my life,never! b.I sce nobody on the road,said Alice.'I only wish I had such eyes'the King remarked,To be able to scc nobody-and at that distance too!

Or it may be text treated as factwhen an exprcssion such as the sane questions arise ...rcfcrs back to the whole of some prcvious discussion.

All the abovc pattcrns of referencc arc familiar from thc pcrsonals and the demonstratives.But it should bc noted that same,siilar,identicalequal and different do not necessarily imply referencc of any kind: the comparison may be purcly intcrnal, two or more things being compared with cach othcr.For examplc

[2:79] a.Most pcoplc havc the same breakfast cvery day. b.The candidates gavc three similar answers. c.All parties showcd an identical reaction to the news.

The first means the samc as every other day' though with the possible ambiguity of'the samc as cach other';thc sccond'similar to each other the third 'rcacted in thc same way as cach other'.Here the comparatives are functioning not as Deictic but as Epithet,and thcrcforc in this use they will rollow any numeral that may be present, whereas in Deictic function they precedc it: contrast 2:8oa],where different is Deictic and refcrential, with [2:8ob] whcre it is Epithet and non-rcferential:

[2:8o] a. They were a diffcrcnt two colours. b.They were two different colours

The first means different from the two rcferrcd tothe sccond different from each other'.Usagc is not totally consistent, however, and one not infrequently comes across the second type used in the first of the two meanings.The words other, additional and else occur only in the refcrcntial sense;equal, on thc other hand,is normally not refercntial, and can be so only when modifying nouns such as number, anount and quantity.

A brief comment on other and else.Else is distinguished not only by its unique position in relation to what it modifics, following instead of prcceding,but also by the fact that it can accompany only the general nouns and adverbs someone,nothing,everywhere ctc, or thc corresponding interrogatives who,what, where etc.Other has two mcanings,different' and additional'leading at times to unccrtainty of intcrpretation:

[2:81 I nccd some othcr clothes.-As well, or instead?

# 2.5.2 Particular comparison

Particular comparison cxprcsses comparability between things in respect of a particular propcrty.The propcrty in qucstion may be a matter of quantity or of quality.

1 If thc comparison is in terms of quantity,it is cxpresscd in the Numcrative element in the structure of thc nominal group; cithcr a) by a comparative quantifier,egmore in more nistakes,orb by an adverb of comparison submodifying a quantifier,eg: as in as many mistakes.

2If the comparison is in tcrms of quality, it is cxpressed in either of two waysi) in thc Epithct clcmcnt in the nominal groupcither a) by a comparative adjcctive,eg:easiermore difficult in easier tasksmore difficult tasks,or (b) by an adverb of comparison submodifying an adjective,eg:so in so diffict a task(i as Adjunct in the clauseeither a by a comparative adverb,egfaster in Canbridge rowed faster,or b) by an adverb of comparison submodifying an adverb, eg as in she sang as sweetly.

Particular comparison, likc gencral comparison, is also referential; therc must be a standard of rcfcrencc by which onc thing is said to be superior, equal, or infcrior in quality or quantity. An exanplc of the hearcr's dcmand for a rcferent, when faced with a comparativc of this kind,is thc well-known passage:

[2:82] Take some morc tca the March Hare said to Alice very earnestly. I'vc had nothing yetAlice replied in an offcnded tone, so I can't take more.

The standard of rcference may bc another thing,eg:this tree is taller than that trce, or a measure, egthis tree is taller than ten fect Thc othcr thing may bc implicit, as in the copy-writer's formula for a tastier mneal, use..., where the comparison is presumably with a mcal prepared without the product, or perhaps one prepared with Brand X It may be somc generalized situational referent, as in

[2:83] We arc dcmanding higher living standards -prcsumably than we have now'.The most gencralized comparative is, actually, the superlative: lighest mcans,sinply,higher than any other. Superlatives are non-rcfercntial bccause they are self-defining; and for this reason thcy regularly act as defining Modifier, being shown to be defining in the usual way by the prescnce of the definite articlc: so in the highest momntain in Europe, the shows that highest..in Europe specifies which mountain f [2:6re] above).In some languages which,in this region of the grammar,have resources similar to English the supcrlative is, in fact, the combination of the comparativc with thc dcfinite article.English kecps comparison and definiteness formally apart, and so has, on the one hand, generalized exophoric comparatives uscd as defining modifiers, as in the milder tobacco than any), and on the other hand non-defining superlatives such as a latest notion is... meaning one of thc latest notions.

All the usual typcs of refercnce are found.For example, the following are cataphoric:

[2:84] a.Thcre were twicc as many peoplc there as last time. b.He's a better man than I am. c.There arc more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than arc dreamt of in your philosophy.

[2:84a] is comparison of quantity,with a Numcrative as comparative, and [the people who wcre there] last tine as referent;b) is quality, with an Epithet as thc comparative,and I-or rather, [the man that I an-as referent. In c), thc referent is [the things that are dreant of in your philosophy; the comparison is again quantitative,but the example shows that more has some of the ambiguity that is present with other see end of 2.5.1 above:wc interprct Hamlet as mcaning not just a grcatcr quantity of things but things that are different in kind. All these represent structural cataphora; the refcrent is within the nominal group. Also structurally cataphoric are examplcs such as [2:85]wherc the comparative is an Adjunct in thc clause:

[2:85 The little dog barkcd as noisily as the big one.

Here the refercnt is not a thing but a process:not the big one but the big one [barked].Examplcs [2:84] and [2:85] illustratc the point that the referent of a cataphoric comparativc is not necessarily made fully explicit in the structure.It may be as in John is older than Peter,whcre thc sccond term in the comparison presupposes nothing from the first; but in many instances the common elcment in thc two terms is carricd over by presupposition -- this is what is shown in square brackcts above.This phenomenon is outsidc our prcsent scope,since this feature has nothing to do with cohesion; but it is of considerable interest, and has been described and cxplained in a number of dctailed studies.Othcr examples of cataphoric comparatives:

[2:86] a.I have never seen a more brilliant performancc than last night/ last night's. b.Shc has a similarly furnished roon to mine.

We do find examples of particular comparison which arc cataphoric but in thc cohcsive sense,such as the following from Alice:

[2:87 She thought that in all her life she had nevcr scen soldicrs so uncertain on thcir feet: they were always tripping over something or othcr,and whenever one went downseveral more always fell over him,...

The comparativc clement is so uncertain on their feet the text then has a colon as a signal that this is to be interpreted as pointing forward.

It is casy to think of exophoric examples; one is thc fisherman's so big with thc arms held apart to indicate the sizc of the catch, another the hairdresser's would you like the water cooler?This type of exophoric comparative is a very commonly used form of instruction and observation in cvcryday life we relate our wishcs to the actual state of things, or rclate what is there to what was there or what is somcwhere clse:not so much noise!,go slowlier!,I need a sharper one, mine was much prettier and so on.One of Alice's comments on her expcriences took such a comparative form: Curiouser and curiouser!

As always,it is the anaphoric typc that intercsts us, since this is what brings about cohesion in the text; examples are perhaps obvious cnough:

[2:88 a.Cassius:Ye gods,ye gods, must I endurc all this? Brutus:All this?Ay,moreFret till your proud hcart break. b.When $\mathcal { L } ^ { 8 }$ ooo is a minor mattcr, it must be really largc-scale crime that is in question?' Bigger rackets go on. c. Apparently Brown resigncd, when his proposal was rejected. -I wish he could have acted less precipitatcly.

The anaphoric comparatives are nore,bigger and less precipitately;and their refercnts arc clearly identifiable as this 8,ooo and resigned. As usual there is also extended refercnce to longcr and lcss clearly dcfined passages of text, for examplc so many in [2:89]:

[2:89] Here the Red Queen bcgan again.Can you answer useful questions?'she said.'How is bread made? I know that!'Alice cried eagerly.You take some flourWhere do you pick the fower?'the Whitc Queen asked.In a garden or in the hcdges? Well it isn't picked at all, Alice cxplained: it's ground ' How many acres of ground?'said the White Queen.'You mustn't lcave out so many things!

It is in thc nature of comparatives that, of all the refercnce items, they are the ones that are most typically anaphoric rather than cxophoric.This is to be cxpected.Personals and demonstratives both involve a form of rcference that is inhcrently extralinguistic, though it nay be reinterpreted in linguistic terms: reference to speech roles (the roles of the participants in thc communication process),and to proximity to the speaker,is essentially refercnce to thc situation, and only thc third person'pcrsonals, whosc situational definition is a purely negativc onc -person or thing

OTHIER THAN spcaker or addrcsscc -,havc the anaphoric function as thc clcarly prcdominant one, with cxophoric rcference being only secondary. With comparison, however, althougn the relationship is still clearly a referential one (in the scnsc in which wc are using thc term),thc specific nature of this relationship, that of likeness or comparability bctwcen things, makcs it morc probable that the things which are bcing related to one another should be at the samc level of abstraction; in other words, that both the comparative and its referent should be located at the semantic levcl (ie in the text rather than the onc in the text and the othcr in thc situation. Thus whilc there certainly is cxophoric refcrcnce with the comparatives - thc scntcnce following [2 : 89] providcs a nicc examplc of it:

[2:89] cont'd) Fan her hcad!the Red Qucen anxiously intcrrupted. 'She'll be fevcrish after so much thinking!

as a general rulc they tend to be text-oricnted, and to give the reader or hcarer a strong sense of fibres of internal cohesion.

Like general comparison, particular comparison may also be purcly internal, and thus not referential at all; in this casc it is expressed by sub-modifiers in $- l \gamma$ nearly always equally:

[2:90] Thcy asked me thrcc cqually difficult qucstions.

As it stands, this is ambiguous; it could be anaphoric, But in the sense of each as difficult as the othersit is non-rcfcrential, like [2:79] above.

# 2.5.3 A note on so,such and as

Among the words of comparison,these require a brief spccial mention.In principle they can bc regarded as variants of the same word, which takes the form such when it is an adjective, so when it is a free adverb and as when it is a bound adverb.This is something of an ovcrsimplificationbut it approximates to the facts; all have thc same mcaning of similar(ly). and the choicc among thcm is largely a matter of grammatical function.

We find so and such used sinply as intensificrs, meaning'extremely, although perhaps cven here therc is a nuance ofsuch as you would never have inagined':

[2:91] a. Thc war scenes in the film were so terrifying. b. Our neighbours arc such a nuisance.

These become structurally cataphoric in [2:92] [2:92] a. The war scencs in the film werc so terrifying that many of the audience left. b.Our neighbours are such a nuisance that we may have to move.

Historically [2:93] are also cataphoric,though thcy arc no longer felt to be so:

2:93 a. He hid in the shcd so that no onc would find him b.Our fear of her was such that we darcd not contradict her.

Both 2:92] and 2:93] are unusual among instances of cataphora in that the refercnt is not part of the nominal group;in addition,so, such and as all occur in thc usual typc of cataphora whcrc the referent is a Qualificr, for example:

[2:94 Such an cfficicnt man as John So cfficient a man as John is unlikely to be mistaken. A man soas efficicnt as John

Exophorically we find such and soas is unusual among reference items in having no exophoric use-this is a corollary of its bound-ness.So if we werc watching someone lifting a heavy wcight we might say [2:95a], but not [2:9sb],which could occur only anaphorically, following something likc I didn't expect John to beat Peter:

[2:95] a. I ncver thought he was so strong. b.I ncver thought he was as strong.

Alternatively we could make the as in [2:9sb cataphoric by adding as that at the cnd, with the cxophoric reference carricd by thc that. Another example of exophoric so is the Carpenter's

2:96 I wish you were not quite so deaf-I'vc had to ask you twice!

though that is sinultaneously cataphoric to thc succceding line.Nonc of these itcms,however,is as frequently used in exophoric contexts as thc demonstratives are;as we have already remarked,coniparatives as a whole are more text-oricnted than demonstratives, and so,suc and as arc quite typical in this respect.

Wc have alrcady citcd cxamples of thcir anaphoric usc, both independently,in gencral comparison eg[2:77][2:78]and as Submodifiers in particular comparison [2:89].Threc furthcr cxamples:

2:97 a.He seemcd most upsct.-I never knew hc cared so. b.Let me have men about me that are fat Yon Cassius hath a lean and hungry look. Such men are dangerous. c.Arc five nights warncr than onc night, then?'Alice ventured to ask. Fivc times as warm,of course.

We shall comc across so and suc in other cohesive functions, in substitution Chapter 3 and conjunctionChaptcr 5).In particular,so has a widc rangc of uses,partly owing to its functioning frccly both as Submodificr and as Adjunct. In this respect,it is resemblcd by more and less; to givc one more example,they arc Adjunct in [2:98a], Submodifier in [2:98b]:

[2:98 a.He secmcd most upsct.-I ncver knew hc cared so.-Hc uscd to care even nore. b.He comes every week.-I never knew he came so often.-He uscd to come even more often.

But more and less are only comparatives, whereas so is many other things besides all of them cohesive in one way or another.

Finally there arc a number of expressions which resemblc thc comparatives in mcaning but are themselves constructcd in othcr ways, exemplificd in [2:99a-e]:

[2:99] a.Oswyn then says that a well-drilled equerry took two steps forward,reccived the picture from you, and took two steps back.He was accustomed to the wholc manoeuvre, that is to say.And then the visit cnded. Would you say that's right? Nothing of the kind,my dear fellow\* b.If we'd gone on pretending long cnough,I belicvc we might have been happy togcther, somctimcs. It often works out like that.'t c.Walk right up, and takc the box where evcryone can see you. That way it won't look as though you're stealing. d.Edward ran up and vaulted the fcnce without effort.John tried to do likewise-with disastrous results. e.You don't seem to have got very far with all those jobs I asked you to do.And another thing -what have you done with the scissors?

Expressions such as of the kind like that that waydo likewise, and another thing show a scmantic likeness to the comparatives which suggests that thcy might be treated under this heading.But it would not be easy to definc or to list thc set of expressions that were being includcd within this catcgory. What is more important, thcy can all be identified in onc way or other with other typcs of cohesion,either because they contain a dcmonstrative the,thisthat or a substitute (door because they fall within onc of the conjunctivc categories $( e _ { \mathcal { S } } ^ { \sigma } .$ thc discourse adjuncts in addition,and another thing, similarlyin other words, $s _ { 0 } f a r )$ and it is this that dctcrmines how they are used. It sccms more satisfactory thcrefore to interprct them not as comparatives but as falling under thosc other hcadings,always bcaring in mind that the different forms of cohesion arc nowhere sharply sct apart one from another.

# Chapter 3

# Substitution

# 3.1 Substitution and ellipsis

In this and thc next chapter we shall be discussing another type of cohesive relation, which takes two different forms: substitution, and ellipsis.Thesc can bc thought of in simplest terms as processes within thc textsubstitu\~ tion as the replacement of one item by another, and cllipsis as the omission of an item. Essentially the two are the same-process; cllipsis can be interpreted as that form of substitution in which the item is replaced by nothing.But the mcchanisms involved in the two are rathcr different, and also, at lcast in the case of ellipsis, fairly complex; so wc shall devote a chaptcr to cach.

# 3.1.1 Substitution and reference

The distinction betwccn substitution and reference is that substitution is a rclation in the wording rather than in the meaning.It has bcen cmphasized already that thc classification of cohesive relations into different types should not bc seen as implying a rigid division into watertight compartments. There are many instances of cohesive forms which lie on the borderline bctween two typcs and could bc intcrpreted as one or the other.The situation is a familiar one in many ficlds, and when onc is attempting to explain phenomena as complex as thosc of human language it would be surprising to find things otherwise; this is particularly so when we are concerned with phcnomena which arc both semantic and grammatical, sincc it frequently happens that semantic criteria suggest onc intcrprctation while grammatical criteria suggest another, and the description has to account for both facing both ways at once. The analysis that is adopted here is based on ccrtain gencral principles, to which particular instanccs can be more or less unambiguously rcferred.

The-principle distinguishing rcfcrence from substitution is reasonably clear.Substitution is a rclation bctween linguistic items,such as words or phrases;whereas reference is a relation bctwecn mcanings.In terms of the linguistic systcm, reference is a relation on thc scmantic level, whercas substitution is a relation on the lexicogrammatical lcvel,thc level of grammar and vocabulary,or linguistic forn.Ellipsis, as wc have already renarked,is in this respect simply a kind of substitution; it can be defincd as substitution by zero.So we have:

<html><body><table><tr><td>Type of cohesive relation:</td><td>Linguistic level:</td></tr><tr><td>Reference</td><td>Semantic</td></tr><tr><td>Substitution (including Ellipsis</td><td>Grammatical</td></tr></table></body></html>

The mcaning of the reference item he is some person male),othcr than thc speaker or addressec, who can be identified by rccourse to thc cnvironment'The cohcsion lics in the semantic identity; and the fact that in a given instancc the relevant cnvironment may be the preccding tcxt, in which sayJohn Snith has occurred, is incidental. Anaphoric refcrence, as we have seen, is merely a special casc of rcferencc in general, and the text is merely a special case of the environment; the rcference may just as well be exophoric, where the rclevant cnvironmcnt is thc situation. Anaphoric and exophoric reference arc both dcrived from the general underlying notion of recoverability of mcanings from the environment.

Substitution, on the othcr handis a rclation within the text. A substitutc is a sort of counter which is used in place of thc repetition of a particular item.For cxamplc,in

[31 a.My axc is too blunt.I must get a sharper onc. b.You think Joan alrcady knows?-I think cverybody does.

one and does are both substitutes: one substitutes for axe, and does for knows. And whereas in rcference there is no inplication that the presupposed item could itself have figured in the text, and in many instances we know it could not have donc this is implied in the casc of substitution. Thus in 3:1 a and b| it would bc cntirely possible to rcplaceone by axe and does by knows.

It follows that as a general rule, the substitute item has the same structural function as that for which it substitutes. In the above example, one and axe are both Head in thc nominal group; and does and knows arc both Hcad in the verbal group. Thc identity is less obvious in [3:2]:

[32Has Barbara left-I think so.

where thc substitute so stands for that Barbara has left. But hcre too thc so has the samc function in relation to I think as has a clause of reported speech.Againwe have secn that reference is diffcrent there is no such restriction thcrc, and the grammatical function of a reference itcm may be quite diffcrcnt from that of its refcrent cxample [2:21] and [2:22]).

From thc point of vicw of textual cohesion, of coursc, substitution resembles reference in being potentially anaphoric, and hence constituting a link bctwceen parts of a text. But here too there is a difference, following from the different nature of the two typcs of relation.Because rcfcrcncc is basically a non-verbal relation, a reference item may point in any direction, and pointing to thc preceding text is only onc among the set of possibilities. Substitution, on the other hand, being a verbal relation, is essentially confined to the text. Exophoric substitution is fairly rarc; and it has the effect of implying that somcthing HAs been said bcfore. If the fisherman sccs me admiring his catch, he may say, without my having uttereda word:

[3:3] Ah! but you should have scen the one that got away.

In doing so,however, he 'puts into my mouth' some such obscrvation as That's a good-sized trout you've got there. I myself might even havc said That's a good-sized one you've got there, using exophoric substitution, in the first placc; even herc,however, there would bc a sharcd assumption that the fish in front of us was already the topic of convcrsation.The vast majority of all instances of substitution are endophoric; and of these again, the vast majority are anaphoric, although we shall come across the possibility of cataphoric substitution under certain circumstances. Ncarly cvcry occurrence of a substitute, in other words, is a source of cohcsion with what has gone beforc.

# 3.1.2 Types of substitution

Since substitution is a grammatical relation, a rclation in the wording rather than in the meaning, the different typcs of substitution arc defined grammatically rather than semantically. The critcrion is the grammatical function of the substitutc item.In English,thc substitute may function as a noun as a verb, or as a clause. To these correspond the three types of substitution:nominal,verbal,and clausal.

Thesc will be discussed in turn:nominal substitution in 3.2,verbal substitution in 3.3 and clausal substitution in 3.4.Thc following is a list of the itcns that occur as substitutesthe list is very short:

Nominal: one,ones;same Verbal: do Clausal: so,not

There are a few cxprcssions in which there is somc indeterminacy among the thrce types, for cxamplc, do so, do the same; thcse will come up for discussion where thcy seem most appropriate.In addition, there is a borderlinc where substitution shades into lexical cohesion, involving thc use of GENERAL wORDs such as thing in a cohesive function.For the discussion of thcse see the chapter on lexical cohesion Chaptcr 6).

# 3.2 Nominal substitution

The substitute one/ones always functions as Head of a noninal group,and can substitute only for an item which is itself Head of a nominal group. For cxample:

[3:4] Ishoot the hippopotamus With bullets made of platinum Because if I use lcaden ones His hide is sure to flatten'em.\*

Hcre bullets is Head of the nominal group bullets made of platinun and ones is Head of the nominal group leaden ones.

Thc two nominal groups need not themselves have thc same function in thc clause; cithcr may have any function that is open to a nominal group.Sometimes, as with refcrence, the prcsupposed item is buried deep inside a complex structure: thc hearer gencrally has no difficulty in rccoveringitcf2:23above;

[3:5] If only I could remember where it was that I saw someonc putting away the box with those candles in I could finish thc decorations now.-You mcan the littlc coloured ones?

Thc substitutc may differ from the presupposed item in numberin the following the prcsupposed item is the singular cherry, whercas the substitute is plural:

[3:6] Chery ripe,cherry ripe,ripc I cry. Full and fair ones - comc and buy.

\*H.BellocThe Hippopotamusin The Bad Child's Book of BeasrsDuckworth.

But the noun that is presupposcd is always a count noun; there is no substitute form for mass nouns. Contrast [3:7a and b]:

[37] a.These biscuits are stalc.-Gct some fresh ones. b.This breads stale.-Gct somc fresh.

In (b) thc only possiblc form of substitution is substitution by zero, which is what wc call ellipsis Chapter 4).Scmantically,ellipsis and substitution arc vcry close we have said that cllipsis can bc interprcted as substitution without a substitute.Grammatically, however, the two are fairly distinct.

Some further cxamples of one/ones as substitute:

[3:8] a. So she wandered on, talking to herself as she went, till on turning a sharp corner,she came upon two fat littlc mcn,so suddenly that she could not hclp starting back,but in another moment she rccovered herself, feeling sure that they must beTWEFDLEDUM AND TWEEDLEDEE. They stood so still that she quitc forgot they wcrc alive, and she was just looking around to sce if the wordrweedle'was written on the back of each collar, when she was startled by a voicc coming from the onc marked DuM. b.I've heard some strange stories in my time. But this one was perhaps the strangest onc of all. c.Which kind of cngines do you want? Ones with whistles, Or ones without? d.My dear, I really must get a thinner pencil. I can't manage this one a bit; it writes all manncr of things that I dont intend.

# 3.2.1The meaning of substitute onc/oncs

The substitutc one/ones presupposes some noun that is to function as Head in the nominal group. It is a substitution counter put in to fill the Head slot. The mcaning is 'the noun to fill this slot will be found in the preceding text (occasionally elscwhere)'.

In the typical instance thc substitute carries over' only the Head itself, it does not carry over any modifying clements by which this may have been accompanied.So for example in [3:4] thc usc of ones as substitute specifically excludes thc defining Modifier made oj platinum ones replaces bullets and that is all. Furthermore, however, in placc of thc original modifying clements the substitute regularly brings with it its own defining

Modificrin this case leaden.Thc cffcct is differential: leaden ones is specifically diffcrentiated from ones that are made of platim

lt is this differentiation which is charactcristic of the use of substitutes in gencral.A substitutc is a carrier of some information which diffcren tiates the instancc in which it occurs from the other instance to which it relates by cohesion.In thc case of a nominal substitute, this means that it is thc carrier of some modifying clcment which has this differential function: so ones is a carricrfor leaden which has thc function of differentiating the bullets mcntioned in this instance from the ones mentioncd carlier,those made of platinm.

It follows therefore that the nominal substitutc oneones is always accompanied by somc modifying element which functions as DErInING in the particular contcxt.This element is not nccessarily the same in its structural function in thc nominal group as that which it repudiates; in our cxample 3:4,the rcpudiated element made of platim is a Qualifier, whcrcas the one acconpanying thc substitute, leaden, is a Classifier. Thcrc is a similar example in thc sentence just writtenwherc thc same thing happens in reverse;here thc substitutc is accompanied by a Qualificr, namely acconpanying the snbstitute, and what it repudiates is a Classificr, namcly repudiated.) Another example:

[3:9] I thought I'd finishcd with thc toughest assignments. They didn't tell me about this onc.

where the Epithet toughest is rcpudiated by thc Deictic this. In all such instanccs the modifying element in the anaphoric nominal group,namely leadenaccompanying the substitute,and this is acting as a defining Modificr.

We havc used the tcrm REpuDiArioN, and this concept provides a key to the undcrstanding of substitution (including ellipsis),distinguishing it at the same time rathcr clearly from reference.Thc notion of repudiation is cxplained as follows. In any anaphoric context, somcthing is carried over from a previous instancc.What is carried ovcr may bc the whole of what thcre was,or it may bc only a part of it; and if it is only a part of it, then the rcmainder,that which is not carried ovcr, has to be REpuDiA TED. For example, in

[3:1o We have no coal fircs; only wood oncs.

fires is carricd over anaphorically but coal is repudiatcd.

Scmantically this mcans that, given the set of things designated in thc original instancc,what is now being designatcd is in some scnse a new subset.It may bc a differcnt subsct from that spccified previouslyas in [3:1o];or a subsct now specificd wherc nonc had been spccified bcfore, as in [3:11].

[3:11 Did you light fires?-Only wood ones.

It may merely bc a new aspcct of or angle on what was thcre bcfore, as in [3:12] Do you remcmber that thunderstorm we had the last tine we were here?That was a terrifying one!

It may even bc THE sAM subset or aspectwhere thc sameness is itself unexpected or contrastive.This, interestingly, is the only class of instances in which the substitute one/ones carrics thc tonic nucleus:

[3:13] Would you like mc to changc thc pictures in your roon?\~ No, I think wc'd likc to kccp thc samc oNes.

Whcreas in [3:1o] there is repudiation of an cxplicit subset, the class of coal fires, in cxamples such as $\left[ 3 : \mathbb { I } \mathbb { I } - 3 : \mathbb { I } \ 3 \right]$ what is repudiated is implicit: fires other than wood oncs, \*thunderstorns other than tcrrifying ones (or 'thunderstorms in their non-terrifying aspects),and pictures other than the same ones'(ie all those that would result from the process of changing).But what is common to all is that in one way or another therc is a redefinition of the thing that is represented by the Head noun, involving some form of rcpudiation of the definition in the original instancc.

This does not neccssarily mean that EveryrHING in thc original definition must be repudiated. In [3:8a],for example,the presupposed instance is two fat little men; the presupposing one is the one narked $\cdot _ { D U M }$ .Now Tweedledum is just as fat and little as Tweedledee is; the only clement that is repudiatcd here is the two.Compare:

[3:14] That new cloth-backed Ordnance Survey one-inch tourist map you sold mc was ideal -but I gave it away.Have you got another onc?

whcrc everything is carried over except the that. In instances like this whcre the Head noun that is presupposed is accompanied by a string of modifying clements, thc context will usually nake it clear how much is carried over,working backwards, as it wcre, from the Hcad.Exactly the same phcnomcnon ariscs in ellipsis, and it will be illustratcd further in the next chapter.

We said at the beginning of 3.2.1 that the substitute one/ones is a substitution counter filling the Head function in the nominal group, and that it normally carries over only the Head itsclf. Wc can now put this morc precisely.Thc use of the substitutc always involvcs somc ncw modifying elcmcnt that is, thercfore, defining: this one, another one, the biggest one, the one that got away and so on. This does not imply that nonc of the modifying clements can bc carried over from the presupposed item.It mcans merely that there is always some point of contrast; thc meaning of the nominal group containing thc substitute is nevcr cxactly identical with that of the nominal group that is prcsupposed.

This is the esscntial difference between pcrsonal or denonstrative reference and nominal substitution.In reference there is a total referential identity between thc referencc item and that which it presupposes; nothing is to bc addcd to the dcfinition. In substitution thcrc is always somc redefinition.Substitution is uscd prcciscly where the refercnce is not identical, or there is at lcast some new specification to be added.This requires a dcvice that is essentially grammatical rather than scmantic; the prcsupposition is at the grammatical level. The substitute one/ones is the markcr of a grammatical relation;it presupposes a particular noun, typically one that is to be found in the preceding text, and is itself merely a kind of counter for which that noun has becn cxchanged. Since its role is to signal that thcre is some form of redefinition,it has to be accompanied by somc defining Modifier, and can therefore be thought of as a carrier for such defining elemcnts. The proccss of defining has thc cffect of repudiating whatever is not carried over in the presupposition rclation: the new dcfinition is contrastive with respect to the original one.

For this rcason one can ncver substitute for a propcr name:a proper namc is already fully defined as unique, and there is no way of adding to or altering the dcfinition.Odditics like Have you seen John? -Well, I saw the tall one just now where therc is more than one Johnare exceptions not to the use of one but to the general definition of propcr names. In this instance John is being treated by the rcspondent as a class name.

# 3.2.2 Conditions of use of the nominal substitute

As illustration of the usc of thc nominal substitute one/ones, lct us first consider thc following forms:

[3:15] (ii) (ii) a. this one this new one this one with wheels b.the one the new onc the one with whcels c.one anew one one with wheels

Those in row (a might occur in some such text as Mummy, will you buy me a bus?I want ...All occur quitc frccly since each one contains a modifying elemcnt this, this new this ...wit/ wheels to which one is attachcd as Head and which is interprcted as defining in function it was pointed out above that substitute one always requires to bc defined).

Those in row (b) have the definite article which,as we saw in Chapter 2, does not itself carry the necessary specification; it mercly indicates that this spccification is available in the environment. In bii and bii) thc spccification is contained in the Modifier Epithct new, Qualifier with wheels), to which the refers cataphorically.But bi) is oddit has no defining Modifier, and can thcrcforc occur only in a highly restricted context where thc meaning is fully spccified anaphorically,and so the scnse is the one you mcanas in I know the one thats the one,these are the oues. In other contcxts only some expanded form such as the oue you mean can occur.

Thosc in row (c) have the indefinite articlc. This is obvious in cii), since both $a$ and one appear. In (cii the indcfinitc articlc and the substitute arc fused,so that a one'is represented simply as one;it is in fact not impossiblc, though it is still relatively rare,to kcep then apart and say a one with wheels.What about ci?This might at first sight also seem to be a fusion of substitutc one with the indcfinite article;but this intcrpretation will not really stand. For onc thing,it is semantically undefincd; there is no explicit form to which it can bc rclated, as the one relatcs to the one you mean -naturally,since if therc was it would have the dcfinitc article and not the indefinite. For anothcr thingit has no plural ones, whcrcas the substitute one always participates in the singular/plural system realized as one/ones eg:I know the onesyou mean.In factits plural is some I want oneI want some), and this provides the clue to its intcrprctation : it is simply the indefinite articlc in the form which it takcs as Hcad of the nominal group.Thus I want one is simply the realization that takcs the place of I want ${ \vec { a } } _ { j } ^ { \cdot }$ the one is anaphoric,but by ellipsis (not rcplacemcnt) of the noun functioning as'Thing'.The relation between substitutc one and deterniner indefinite article) one is discussed further in 3.2.3.3 bclow.

Leaving aside (ci) then, on the grounds that it docs not contain the substitute one, we can say that in all the other examples undcr $\left[ 3 : 1 5 \right]$ the substitute one is obligatory; as we cxpressed it earlier,it is a carrier of the specifying element this,new etc.Evcn in ai it cannot be omitted without changing the meaning.I want this is perfectly grammatical but mcans $^ { * } \mathrm { I }$ want this thingnot $\mathrm { ~ ` ~ } ]$ want this bus or whatever thc one in $\boldsymbol { \mathit { I } }$ want this one is substituting for).Thcre are environments, however, in which the substitute one is optional, giving a choice between substitution and ellipsis:

[3:16] (i (ii) (ii) a.these ones these new oncs thesc (ones) with wheels b.whichone which ncw one which one with wheels c.hersher one) her new one hers (her one with wheels d.Paul's (onc) Paul's new one Paul's one with wheels e.each(onc cach ncw one each one with wheels f.the last(onc) thc last new one the last one with wheels g.two?oncs) two newones two(ones with wheels

Column i is tending to be filled out one hears not only her one lis one, and others such as what one, but also especially in children's speechtvo ones. In column (ii) thc substitutc is obligatory, since thc nominal group cannot normally cnd with an Epithet.Column (ii) is very variable, and in somc instanccs an alternative of the form that one of hers with wheels, two of the ones with wheels would tend to bc prcfcrrcd.Note that although this does not nean the same as this one (ie cannot bc interpreted as cllipsis), these can mean the samc as these ones ie it is ambiguous in contexts where it could be interpreted clliptically):I want these mcans either $^ { * } \mathrm { I }$ want these ones,eg buses or $\cdot _ { \textup { I } }$ want these things

As mcntioned carlicr, thc plural of the substitutc one is ones.With the exception of [3:1sci],the plural ones could occur in all positions in [3:15] and [3:16],showing that these are indeed all instances of substitution.The nominal substitutc can in fact substitute for any count noun any noun participating in the nunber system)either non-human or human;in this it differs from the pro-noun'the only other form of one which has plural ones see 3.2.3.4 below).

Aside from the doubtful cases of dcterminer plus substitutc, such as my one, two ones citcd above, the onc structural cnvironment in the nominal group in which the substitutc cannot occur is within a nominal compound: thus we do not normally find examples such as

[3:17 a. Lend me a pen.-I've only got a fountain one. b. Lct's go and see the bears. The polar ones arc over on that rock. c.Is that a tennis racket?-No it's a squash one. d.Are you planting trees hcrc?-I thought of planting some apple ones.

This restriction can be stated roughly by rcfcrence to tonic accent: a word FOLLowinG the accented word in a nominal expression cannot be substituted; and since tonic accent is itself a realization of a compound noun structure, this is cquivalent to saying that therc can bc no substitution within a compound noun.Howcver thc restriction also cxtcnds, under conditions which are not clear, to ccrtain instances which on the criterion of tonicity would not bc compounds but structures of Classificr plus Thing,eg

[3:18] a. He's an idiot.-The village one? b.We sat by a lovely little stream. It was cool and clcar like all mountain ones.

Thc tonic structure of village idiot mountain streanshows that they are Classifier-Noun structures,not compound nouns; and yet it is scarcely possible to substitute the Head noun in such cases.

# 3.2.3 The word onc other than as substitute

Wc have noted that not all occurrences of one are instances of substitution, and it is uscful to distinguish the substitutc one from the various other words one thc othcr items which are forms of the same etymon. These are thc personal pronoun one, cardinal numcral one, detcrminer one (alternativc form of the indefinite article) and a fourth one which is relatcd to the category of general nouns (see 6.1 below) and which wc might refer to as a pro-noun,using a hyphen.

# 3.2.3.I PERSONAL PRONOUN OHC

This is the personal form with generalized refcrercc, sometimes called generic person discusscd in Chapter 2 2.3.1 examplcs [2:8], [2:9] Another cxample ofit is:

[3:19 One ncver knows what might happen.

This one has no cohesive force; it is nevcr used anaphorically, but only exophorically, not unlike you and ive in their gencralizcd exophoric sense. It is rather easily distinguishable from the substitute one, since it always occurs alonc as the solc clement in a nominal group, an environment that is impossible for the substitute, which is always modified f3.2.2above.

# 3.2.3.2 CARDINAL NUMERAL Oe

This is exemplified in:

[3:20 a. He made one very good point b.Ten set out, but only onc came back.

Again it is clear from inspection that neithcr of these occurrences of one is a substitute.That in (a) is functioning as (Numerative) Modifier in thc nominal group one very good point, whereas the substitutc one functions only as Head; that in b is functioning as Hcad, but it is unmodified, whcrcas the substitutc is always modified.The one in (b) looks at first sight likc a substitute becausc it is clearly anaphoric: there must be some word such as man prcsupposed for interprctation to bc possiblc. Actually however it is thc cardinal numeral one with cllipsis. In cllipsis, thc presupposed itcm, if it is to be made explicit, is ADDED ro the presupposing one:it does not replace it so ten nen set out but only one man cane back (not but only man came back.In substitution, on the other hand, the prcsupposed item, if it is to bc made explicit REPLAcrs thc presupposing onc:it cannot bc added to itso in

[3:21] Mummy will you buy me a bus?I want that red one.

the non-presupposing form would be that red bus not that red one bus.In any casc oncc such a nominal group is filled out the distinction bccomes obvious, sincc the numeral always precedes any Epithet that is present, whereas thc substitute, since it functions as Head, always follows it.

Cardinal numeral one and substitutc one are quitc distinct in meaning. The former contrasts I) as a Numcrativc, with the other numerals twothree etc2) as a Dcictic, with someotherbothetc as in

[322 a.The onc friend who ncver let hcr down was Enid. b.Can I havc thosc pcaches?-You can have one; leave me thc other.

where againb is cohcsive by cllipsis, like [3:2ob] above.

The substitute one enters into no systemic contrasts; on thc other hand it may be either singular or plural, whcrcas the cardinal one is naturally always singular except in the cxprcssion in ones and twos).The two meanings are compatiblc with cach other, so we regularly find examples suchas

# [3:23] You'vc already got onc red one.

where thc first one is a numcral and the second a substitute: as long as there is an Epithct or Classifier present,both will occur,since the numeral must precede and the substitute follow.If there is no Epithct or Classifier, then the word one can occur only once; the language has not yet adnitted sentences like you've already got one one though this will probably occur in the specch of the ncxt gencration of children.Meanwhile a form such as you've already got oNe might be sccn as a fusion of numeral one and substitutc one, since the mcanings are compatible. However, this interpretation will not really stand, for the same rcasons as werc given for rcjecting the interpretation of [3:1sci] as a fusion of the substitutc with the indefinitc article. In an example such as you've already got one, therc are just two interprctations, the two forms being identical in writing but distinct in spcech: cither the one is phonologically salient, in which case it is the cardinal numeral, or it is phonologically weak, in which case it is the indcfinite articlc (see ncxt section).Neither involves substitution, but both are elliptical.

There are other factors diffcrentiating thc numcral from the substitute. Thc numeral acccpts submodification eg: just one, only one, not one, which the substitute does not; on the other hand thc substitute is regularly modificd by a Deictic, eg: this one your one, which is rare with the numeral functioning as Hcad. Even whcre the numeral is precedcd by a Deictic, therc is no ambiguity in specch, for the reason already given: the numeral is salient, thc substitutc weak.Hence

[3:24] Have you any envelopcs?I need another onc is ambiguous only in writing; in specch,if one is a numeral, so that thc filled out form is another one envelope, the tonic will fall on one,whcrcas if one is a substitutc, the filled out form being another envelope, the tonic will fall on another.

# 3.2.3.3 INDEFINITE ARTICLE One

The normal form of the indcfinite article is aanctymologically ths is a wcakened form of the numcral one. Thc term 'article'is somewhat unncccssary, as it suggests that the articles form a separate word class, whereas both a and the are simply members of thc more general class of determiner.Within the determiner, a belongs to the non-specific class (including anyeitherno ctc.Thc two major typcs of dctcrminerspecific and non-specific, embody different number systcms. Thc specific determiners distinguish singular/plural,with'massgrouped with the singular, as it is in the nounso this house this sugar (singularthese houses (plural. The non-specific determincrs distinguish (count) singular/non-singular, with mass'being grouped with the plural;so the form corresponding to anamely some is used with mass and plural nouns: a house count singularsome sugar some houses non-singular.This some is also a phonologically weakened form.

Like many othcr determiners, the indefinite article can occur elliptically, as Head in thc nominal group;for example

[3:25] a.Arc thcre lions in those hilis?-Yes, we saw some on thc way over. b. I'd likc some coffce. - Then make some.

The filled out forms arc we saw some lions make some coffee. What is the cquivalent form of thc indcfinite article whcn presupposing a count singular noun?

[3:26] a.Are there lions in those hills?-Ycs, we saw one on thc way over. b.I'd like a cup of coffec.-Then pour yourself one.

Here the filled out forms are a lion, a cup of coffee (not one lion, one cup of coffee); one is thc form taken by thc indefinite article when it is functioning as Head of an clliptical nominal group (f Have one of nine!.That this is not the substitute one is shown by the fact that it has thc non-singular some and not ones;fHave some of nine and [3:2sa],whcre we could not say we saw ones on the way over.Morcover thc substitute one docs not occur without a Modificr $( c f [ 3 : 2 , 1 ]$ above). That these forms are elliptical determiners, not substitutes, is further bornc out by the fact that in ncgative and interrogativc they are replaced by any, exactly as the indefinite article is: we didn't see any on the way over.(Likewisc, the instances whcre one is retained in a ncgative environment arc also those where a would be retained in the filled out equivalent, ie where the mcaning is specifically singular,eg

[3:27] I votc the young lady tells us a story.I'm afraid I don't know one'said Alice.

filled form I don't know a story; contrasting with I'm afraid I don't know any (stories).)

This form of thc indefinite article is phonologically simply a non-salient form of the numeral one. There is thereforc an interesting parallelism bctween the definite and the indcfinite articles in the way thcy have cvolved in English.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Selective form [salient] as Modificr or Head</td><td colspan="2">Article [non-salient]</td></tr><tr><td>(demonstrative)</td><td>as Modifier [reduced]</td><td>as Head [weak]</td></tr><tr><td>that</td><td>the</td><td>it</td></tr><tr><td>(numeral) one;sone</td><td>a/an[sm</td><td>one;some</td></tr></table></body></html>

Note thc proportionality in the following pairs of examples:

[3:28] a. Thcy nced that cHAIR. Thcy necd THIAr. They nced the CHAIR.They NEED it. b. They nced one cHAIR. They nccd oONe. They necd a CHAIR. They NEED one.

There is thus ambiguity in the written language between one as numeral and one as indcfinite article, whcn functioning as Head of an elliptical nominal group.This is not usually so in speech, because of thc diffcrence in salience: the numeral is always salient, and may carry tonic promincnce, whereas thc articlc is normally not salient- under ccrtain conditions it can be, but it can never bc tonic. Thcre is typically a contrast between [329a and b]:

[3:29] a.I've lost my coat.-j/AI/saw/one in the/HALL/yesterday =onc coat numeral);non-singular would bc/saw /some...) b.I've lost my coat.-//AI/saw onc in the /HALL/yesterday// =a coatarticle);non-singular would bc.../saw somc...

As far as thc substitutc one is concerned, however, it is distinct from both, by virtuc of its occurring only as Head witH a Modificr prescnt thc one environment that is impossible for numeral or article).Thus in [3:15] above, all occurrences of one are instances of thc substitute except (ci, which is thc indcfinite articlc.That thc substitute and the indefinite article are now quite distinct in meaning is shown by the fact that they readily co-occur, as in [3:1scii] a red one, another one.Where there is no intervening element, the normal form of rcalization is a fusion of the two into a single element one as in cii one with wheels;but even hcre they may bc kept discrcte, as in I need a one with a sharp point, there's a one I hadn't seenbefore.

# 3.2.3.4 PRO-NOUN'one

There is one further meaning of one, in which it is restricted to human rcferents; this is not a substitute form, in the sense that it has no cohesive force, but it is not always casy to distinguish it from the substitute one in texts.Examples:

[3:30] a. Ifsuch a one bc fit to governspeak. b.The ones she really lovcs are her grandparents.

Here one means person' and ones means pcoplebut they are not anaphoric-there is no presupposition of an earlier occurrence of the wORD person or people or any similar noun.

The only othcr word that functions exactly in this way in English is thing.Thesc words one and thing are special items that wc might refer to as pro-nouns; they arc in a scnse intcrmediate bctween the substitute one and the class of gcncral noun discusscd in Chapter 6 below 6.1).It is this one and thing that are found as componcnts in the words something, nothing, anythingeverything sonmeone, no one etc.Strictly speaking thesc itcms one and thing are members of a class of pro-forms'which arc the cquivalent of the interrogative words what, who and so on; thc class of pro-nounsthus also includcs timeplaceway and perhaps reason.Of the two words one and thing,thing corresponds to what and one corresponds to who; hence thing refcrs to non-human nouns and indefinite nouns, while one rcfers to definite human nouns. So for examplc:

[3:31] a.What docs hc nced?The thing hc needs (What he needs) is a passport. b.What does he need?The thing he needs is his passport. c. What does he need? The thing he needs is a lawycr. d. Who does hc need? The one he needs is his lawycr.

Herc the thing can be replaced by what the one cannot, however, be re placed by who, at least not in modcrn English.

Like the substitute, but unlikc all the other forms of one, the pro-noun one has plural onesfor cxamplc cf[3:3ob] above)

[3:32] Now, my dearest ones; gather round.

Since it also functions as Head in the nominal group, and is normally accompanicd by some modifying clement,it is easily confused with the substitute (and is gencrally regarded by grammarians as thc samc item). However, for the purpose of the study of cohesion it is important to keep the two apart, since the substitute is cohesive whercas the pro-noun is not. Moreover thcre can be ambiguity between them; considcr the example

[3:33] The children scemed to enjoy the outing. The onc who didn't was George.

Is George one of the children, or is he the teacher? If one is a substitute, it presupposes child and mcans thc child who didn't ...; if it is a pronoun, it does not prcsuppose anything and means 'thc person who didn't .. .Given the further fact that the substitute is not limited to human rcfcrcntswhilc the pro-form is, it scems desirablc to recognize them as two distinct items.

The principal use of the pro-form one in modcrn English is that cxemplified in [3:31d] and [3:33] in its sccond intcrprctation):that isin clauses displaying theme identification'\* A clause such as the one he needs is his lawyer is relatcd to he needs his lawyer in a systcmatic way its meaning is that the mcssage consists of two parts, a theme his nced' and a rheme his lawyerwith an equals sign betwccn thc two.Compare [3:34] I know nothing about this schcmc. Thc one you should ask is Dr Rawlinson.

meaning thcre is somconc you should ask, namely ... In earlicr English it was more widely uscd in the gencral scnse of'someone' ie one of thc Ones who..., as in Cassius

[3:35] Hated by onc hc loves, brav'd by his brother.

Such uses have by no means disappeared from the language;but thcy are morc common in written styles than in speech.

# 3.2.4 Summary of uses of one

Here arc some further examples to rclatc thc nominal substitute one to the various other items that have been discussed, and to distinguish it from othcr,non-cohesive forms of the word one.They are constructed for brevity, which cxplains even if it does not excuse their uninspiring style.

[3:36] a. I'm fed up with this watch.1) The thing nevcr works. 2 My old one worked all right, but this one's hopeless, 3The thing I want now is a solid state microchronometer. 4Perhaps I'll gct one. b.I like the new manager.1 The man's really cfficient. 2)The previous ones were hopeless, but this one knows his job.3) The thing we need now is some new technicians. 4Perhaps he'll appoint some.

In the grcat majority of instanccs, the substitute one is anaphoric in orientation.Cataphoric instanccs arc less common; an cxample would be [3:37] Shc picked out the lovelicst ones of all the roses in the garden and gave thcm to mc.

wherc ones points forward to roses.Such instances arc however within the structural confincs of the scntencc, and contributc nothing to cohcsion. Finally,wc noted carlier that although substitution is essentially a textual rclation, occasional cxophoric instances will bc found; see the discussion in 3.1.1and cxamplc [3:3]

# 3.2.5Nominal substitute same

We saw in Chapter 2 that the itcm sane occurs as a cohesive elcmcnt of the comparative type 2.3.1examples [2:21-2].In such instancessame is a reference item,not a substitute.There is another cohcsive use of same, this time as a nominal substitute, typically accompanicd by the.Unlike one, which presupposes only the noun Head, the same presupposes an entire nominal group including any modifying elements, except such as are explicitly repudiated.For cxample

[3:38] A: Ill have two poached eggs on toast please. B:I'll have the same.

Not, of course, the same eggs, which would be reference, not substitution. No rcgular modifying element may occur with the same; but it is possible to add a reservation to it, and this takcs thc form of a Qualificr, which is normally introduced by but and often starts with the word with adding a modification or without deleting a modification, ie repudiating it, eg: the same but fried,the sane (but without the toast.Thc prcsupposed item is almost always non-human, and it cannot be a proper namc. It can, however, be an Attributc: that is, an adjective occurring in the usual Epithet function) as Head of a nominal group in a clause of ascription:

[3:39] A: John sounded rather regrctful. B:Yes, Mary sounded the same.

Since an adjective is a kind of noun, and rather regretful is a nominal group, this is still a form of nominal substitution, and so the use of the same in such instances is cntirely to bc cxpected (cf 3.5.2.3 below).

There was an carlicr usc of the same as a pronominal reference item, replaccablc-as thc substiture is not-by hinherit, or themcg

[3:40] This is Othcllo's ancicnt as I take it. -The samc indced a very valiant fellow.

This is sometimes imitated in contemporary usage, especially in the form the very same.Otherwisc, this pattcrn is largely confined today to legal and commcrcial registcrs, where the reference is again always non-human and the may be omitted. Note that in this use same can never carry the tonic:

[3:41] We have today dispatched the first consignment of your order. Kindly arrangc to accept delivery of same.

In Shakespeare's language this pronominal usage with non-human referencc is more general:

[3:42] I am bound to you That you on my bchalf would pluck a flower. -In your behalf still will I wear the same.

# 3.2.5.I SAY THE SAME

In the environment of a process in which a fact'is involved, the same can often substitute for the fact: for example

[3:43] John thought it was inpossible.-Ycs, I thought the same.

More often than not one element in thc presupposed clause, usually a nominal, remains outside the domain of thc substitution:

[3:44]a.Wc can trust Smith.Iwish I could say the same of his partner. b.Winter is always so damp.-Thc samc is often true of summer.

In (a) the same substitutes for that wc can trust ..., Smith' being repudiated by thc following of his partner. Similarly in b) the same substitutes for 'is always so dampwith winter bcing rcpudiatcd by sunmer. Onc form of this usage which is cspccially common in dialogue is the same appliesto)...goes for,as in

[3:45] A: His speech didn't say anything ncw, did it? BThe same applies to most political speeches.

All thcsc are dcviccs for making it explicit that the sane has the status of a fact.

# 3.2.5.2D0THESAME

Sccondly, the nominal substitute the same is often combined with the verb do as a substitute for the process in certain types of clausc.An alternative form is do likewise.For example

[3:46 a. They all startcd shouting.So I did the same. b.My bank managcr bought shares in thc canal company Why don't you do likewise? c.That noisc really unnerves me.-Ycs it does the samc to metoo.

What is bcing substituted here is the process plus any subscqucnt element that is not repudiated.

This form of substitution is slightly odd, in that what is being substitutced is esscntially thc verbal clcment in the clausc, and yet the structural mcans is that of nominal and not vcrbal substitution for which sce thc ncxt scction).The verb do herc is not, in fact, the verbal substitute do but the  general verb' do, that which occurs inWhat are you doing?Don't do that!I've got nothing to do and so onit is the parallel,in the verb class, to thc gcneral nouns'thingperson ctc see 6.1). It is distinct from the verbal substitute do in a number of respects.Phonologically,thc substitute do is weak while thc gcneral verb do is salicnt. Moreover the substitute do substitutes for all vcrbs cxcept be and (in British English generally) have; whereas the gcneral verb do is restricted to clauscs of A crioN as opposed to sUpeRveNtION -essentially, those where the mcaning is someone did something'rather than'somcthing happcncd to somcone'. So we can have

[3:47 a.I likcd the second movement more than I had done the first. b.That sign mcans they're busy - it usually docs, anyway.

in both of which do is a verbal substitute; but we could not havc, following a)Yes I did the same or,following b)Is that what it does? (in both of which do is thc gcncral verb) becausc like and mean arc not actiontypc processes.In some instances there is an cquivalent form of nominal substitution for happening-typc clauses, with the same (thing) happens eg

[3:48] I lost my way in the gallcrics.- The samc thing happened to me.

mcaning 'Ialso lost my way in the galleries

Hcnce the same, although itself a form of nominal substitutc, is used as a means of substituting a nominal or other element in the proccss as a whole, including the process itself. A form such as do the same reflects the general tendency of English to cxpress a proccss in a nominalized form, by means of an emptyvcrb plus its object: do a run-through, do a left tun for run it throughturn leftcf have a fightgive a glance make a fuss. Thc presupposing form the same can thus occur as a substitute not only for nominals expressing things, as in [3:38], but also for facts, as in say the same, and for clcmcnts that are not strictly nominal at all. Whereas one substitutes just thc noun (Head), in thc environment of a nominal group having othcr elements that are contrastive, the same substitutes a nominal group (or something else) in the environment of a clause, so that it is othcr clcments in the clause that provide the contrastive context.

# 3.2.5.3BE THE SAME

As already pointed out, thc form the sane occurs as Attribute in clauses of ascription, where it may substitute either a noun or an adjective - that is, a nominal group having either noun or adjectivc as Head, for exanple (andcf[3:39]above)

[3:49] Charlcs is now an actor.Given half a chance I would have been the same.

Note the potential ambiguity betwcen substitution and reference in such contexts. In [3:so],if the sane is a substitute the meaning is and they also tastc more bitter than thc last oneswhereas if it is a refcrence item the meaning is but they tastc the samc as the last ones did:

[3:5o] These grapefruit smell more bitter than the last ones we had. They taste the same.

(In thc third possible intcrpretation they taste like each otherwhich is improbable hcrc, the same is also a reference itcm, but functioning as Epithet and therefore non-cohesively;cf2.5.1 above, cxamples [2:79] and [2:8o].) For the usc of so in such instances sce the ncxt section.

3.2.6 Difference between the same and ones) as nominal substitutes Apart from the type of example illustrated in [3:40-3:42] above, the same as substitute is always phonologically salient. It contains an accent, and therefore carries the tonic undcr typical or unmarked' conditions: that is to say, if occurring finally it is tonic unless rejected for contrastive reasons.For example,

[3:51A:I'll have two poached cggs on toast plcase BIll have the sAME. c:I'd Like to have the same,but..

B's utterancc has unmarked information focus. In c's the information structure is marked, with contrastive focus on like.

This gives the clue to the role of the same in nominal substitution.The substitute one is a grammatical item which contains no accent; it is always given'in meaning, and serves as a peg on which to hang the new information. In this respect it resembles do 3.3) and so 3.4).The substitute the sanehowcver, functions like a lcxical item;it can carry the information focus, and typically does so when in final position.The meaning is 'the information conveycd by this item in this context is new, but the item itself has occurred before'.So for example

a.I could grow RED ones [3:52 The neighbours grow b.I could grow the sAME yellow chrysanthemums. c.I could grow some roo) d.I could grow some of thc sAME

In a) the substitute ones is uscd so that the Epithet red can carry the UNMARkeD tonicity: that is,so that the focus of information falls on red wITHour this becoming contrastive. In (b) the'yellow'is included in the prcsupposition, and thc substitute the sane carries thc focus: the information as a whole is encoded as new, with thc meaning yellow chrysanthemums'shown to have been present carlicr.Once again it is substitution that is appropriate and not reference.Thcy will not bc rcferentially the same chrysanthemums'; and hence the form I could grow them would be odd here, with them referring' as it were at the lexicogrammatical instead of the scmantic level.) In c the indefinite article some is used as non-specific Deictic, and the form is elliptical; this focuses information on the $\boldsymbol { J }$ and encodes the wholc of the remainder as explicitly given. Finally d) is like b),with the addition of the indcfinite article as Deictic as in c).Note that there is no form I could grow red same,since here thc unmarkcd tonic would be on same whcrc it should be on red; instcad the form is $I$ could grow the same but red, which puts the tonic whcrc it is rcquired whilc still leaving it unmarkcd.

Essentially the same relation obtains between the same and substitute so as between the same and one(s).The patterns discussed in 3.2.5.1-3 say the same,do the same, be the same are the contexts in which the nonsalient substitute altcrnating with the sane would in fact bc so and not $o n e ( s )$ In gcneral so substitutes for a clause, and is dealt with in 3.4 bclow. Howcvcr thcrc is no very clear line between nominal and clausal substitution, and thcsc examples are in a way intermediate between thc two. In the following the weak form of the substitute is so

a.He sAID soroo [3:53]1John felt it was 1 b.He said the sAME disappointing. (11 b.My fol o 2John left before thc cnd. (a.I did so (roo) b.I did the sAME a.He LOOKED sO TOO) b.He looked the sAME 3 John sounded regretful 1 (6.Mary sonded so 1

In type 3) it would bc possible to interpret so following look, sound seem etc as substituting for a clause:Mary sounded as if she was regretful too.Compare

[3:54]... being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing. It isn't'said the Caterpillar. Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet said Alice where so in thc last line substitutes for very confusing but could also be filled out as to be very confusing.On the othcr hand the presupposed item need not be of this forn, as the examplcs in [3:53] show; and in [3:55] neither the presupposed nor the presupposing item could be expanded into a clause:

[3:55] John has become depressed.- Has he ever been so before?

These are in fact instances in which so is substituting for an Attribute: corresponding to he seems intelligent, he seems to be intelligent, he scems as if he is intelligent wc havc he seems so, he seens to be sohe seems as if he is so.If on thc other hand the Attributc is represented by a noun this must always be a count noun and thc weak form is $o n e ( s )$ ;so we should have they taste so too in [3:5o] abovc but $I$ would have been one (too) in [3:49].

In general, therefore, although it takes a nominal form, the same functions as thc accented form of the substitute in all types of substitution, clausal and vcrbal as well as nominal:

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Non-accented</td><td>Accented form (same salient)</td></tr><tr><td>Nominal:</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>count noun</td><td>one(s)</td><td>the same</td></tr><tr><td>attribute</td><td></td><td>(be the same</td></tr><tr><td>Verbal</td><td>do</td><td>do the same</td></tr><tr><td>Clausal (reported)</td><td>so</td><td>(say) the same</td></tr></table></body></html>

It may also be accompanied by a pro-noun thing (way when substituting for an Attribute) as in said the sane thing, tastes the same way; thcsc arc constructed like reference itcms but have comc to bc used as substitutes in thc same way as the items same and so themsclves.

# 3.3 Verbal substitution

The verbal substitute in English is do.This operates as Head of a vcrbal group, in thc place that is occupied by the lexical verb;and its position is always final in the group.Hcrc arc two examplcs fron Alice; in both, thc substitute is thc word that has thc form do not did or don't

[3:56] a. .. . the words did not come the samc as thcy used to do. b.I don't know the neaning of half thosc long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do cither!

The first do, in a)substitutes for cone; that in b substitutes for know the meaning of half those long words.

In [3:56] the presupposed items are in thc same sentence, and so the substitution is not by itsclf cohesive.But vcrbal substitution regularly extends across scntcnce boundarics, as in

[3:57] Hc ncver really succceded in his ambitions.He might have done, onc felt, had it not bcen for the restlessness of his nature.

Here done substitutcs for succeeded in his anbitions and so serves to link thc two sentenccs by anaphora, exactly in thc samc way as the nominal substitute one.

In the three succeeding subscctions we shall discuss thc mcaning of verbal substitution, the conditions of use of the verbal substitute, and other uses of the verb do which are distinct from its usc as a substitute and from which its usc as a substitute is derived.

# 3.3.1 The meaning of the verbal substitute do

In many ways the verbal substitute do is parallel to the nominal substitute one, and it is likcly that its evolution in Modcrn English has followed the analogy of one rather closely.

There are striking parallels between the structure of the verbal group and the nominal group in Modern English, although superficially they arc very different from each other.Like the nominal group, whose structure was discussed in section 2.1 abovc, the verbal group has a logical structure consisting of Head and Modifier, and an experiential structure in which the lexical verb expresses theThing'In the case of the nominal group thc Thingis typically a pcrsoncrcatureobjectinstitution or abstraction of some kind, whereas in the verbal group it is typically an actionevent or relation; but thesc are simply different subcategories of experiential phenomena, and in any case there is considerable overlap and interchange between the two.

In both nominal group and verbal group, the lexical Thing'is substitutable by an cmpty substitution counter that always functions as Hcad. The substitution form in the nominal group, as we havc scen, is one(s). In thc vcrbal group it is do, with the usual morphological scatter do, does,did doingdone

Thcrc is a diffcrence between one and do in their potential donains, the extent of thc items that they can presuppose.Whercas one always substitutes for a noun, do may substitutc eithcr for a vcrb, as in $\left[ 3 : 5 ^ { 6 a } \right]$ or for a verb plus certain other elemcnts in thc clausc, as in $\big [ 3 : \mathsf { S 6 b } \big ]$ and [3:57].

At first sight it might secm as if do substitutcd for the whole of what is called the predicate' in a Subject-Predicatc analysis -the predicator (the verbal group itself)minus its auxiliaries, togcthcr with any complc ments and adjuncts that are present.But any of these may bc rcpudiated, as the following examples show:

[3:58 a.Does Granny look aftcr you evcry day?-She can't do at weekends, because shc has to go to her own house. b.Have they rcmoved their furniture?-Thcy have done thc desks, but that's all so far.

In a) do substitutes for look after me but every day is repudiated by at weekends. In b done substitutes only for removed;their furniture is repudiated by the desks.

As was pointed out in thc discussion of one, substitution and ellipsis are different manifcstations of thc same underlying rclation, that of presupposition at thc lexicogrammatical lcvel.The usc of clliptical forms of the verbal group is very common, and there is very little differcnce in meaning bctween a verbal group having substitution by do and one having cllipsis (ie substitution by zero).For example

[3:59] Inspector taking back the photograph):You recognize hcr? Mrs Birling:No.Why should I? Inspcctor:Of course she might have changed lately.But I can't believe she could have changed so much. Mrs Birling:I don't understand you, Inspector. Inspector:You mean you don't choose to do, Mrs Birling.\*

Both elliptical and substitute forms of the verbal group are illustrated here. Why should 1? is elliptical, presupposing Why should I recognize her?; and you don't choose to do is a substitutc forn, presupposing you don't choose to understand ne.There is very little difference; do could be added in thc first and dclcted in the sccond with hardly any change of meaning. Unlike thc nominal group, however, in which under many conditions (eg following an Epithet) cllipsis is generally impossible, and substitution by one is therefore obligatory as the expression of cohesion, in thc verbal group there arc vcry fcw contexts in which the substitute do Musr be used (for these scc 3.3.2 below).In gcncral, substitute do alternates with zero as a cohesivc dcvice, and the mcaning is thc samc in both: the specific process-cvcnt actionrelation,etc-that is bcing referred to must bc recovercd from the preceding text.If the substitute do is used, its function is to act cxplicitly as a placc-holder, marking out the point at which presupposition is involved. It is possible to construct examples in which its presence appcars to resolve what would othcrwise bc an ambiguity,eg

[3:6o What arc you doing herc?-Wc're mycologists, and we're looking for cdiblc mushrooms.- Yes we arc doing too.

wherc the last scntencc without thc substitute doing would be intcrprcted aswe arc also mycologists

Like the nominal substitute one, the vcrbal substitutc do is typically associated with contrast.It occurs in thc context of somc other item which contrasts with an elemcnt in the presupposcd clause.This is well illustrated by instances in which the two clauses,presupposing and presupposed, arc rclated by comparison, eg

a. Mary is doing. b. hc should be doing. [3:61] John is smoking more now than c.he uscd to do. d. he was doing before.

In aMary contrasts withJohn;in b) should be contrasts with is; in c)used to contrasts with is...ing ind) was...before contrasts with is...now.Similarly do is frequcnt in the second of two clauses rclated by before, afterif, whenctc, as in you will finish well before I have done. Since in these cases the two clauses are structurally rclatcd, the prescncc of do, while it reinforces this relationship, is not nccdcd as the cohcsive factor; but the principlc appears clearly, that substitution is a means of reprcsenting given information in the environment of ncw.Exactly the same principlc operates whcre there is no structural relationship between the two clauses, as in examplcs [3:57-60] above;and here the use of the substitute is preciscly what provides the cohesion.

Since the substitutc is by dcfinition givenin that it is a signal that information is to be rccovered from clsewhcrc, it is phonologically unaccented, or non-prominent. It is usually wcak non-salient in all positions cxcept when it is the initial, and therefore thc only, item in the vcrbal group; in the latter context it is salient, but still non-tonic. For examplc:

[3:62] a. Has anybody fcd the cat-// somebody / must have donc// b.Did anybody fecd the cat $? - 1 1$ SOMEbody/did//

Related to this is the fact that a finite verbal operator preceding substitute do in the verbal group can never be in the rcduced form,sincc this would force promincnce on to the do: hence forms such as he'll do, he's doing, he's done cannot occur as substitutes, at lcast across a scntencc boundary.

However, we saw that with the nominal substitute one thcrc are circumstances under which it is accented, and so can carry thc tonic, namely when the given-ness'of the information it conveys is precisely what is new about it; this is thc typical pattern following the same the same ones).Likewise with do therc is one condition in which it is acccnted, and as far as the meaning is concerned this is essentially thc same condition that we had found with one, although the form of expression is different: it is whcn do is followed by so (Do so). Thc cxpression do so conveys essentially thc samc meaning: the action, evcnt or relation in question has been referred to before, but it is prccisely hcre that thc new information lies. So for example

[3:63] a. Yes, I think you'd better leave off' said thc Gryphon: and Alice was only too glad to do so. b.Just finish off watering thosc plants. And let me know when you've done so.

Thc cxpression do so dcrives from pro-verb do (sec 3.3.3.3 below) followed by anaphoric so. The do is accented; it is thereforc typically salient, with the potentiality of carrying the tonic. The differcncc in the rhythmic patterns of the two forms of the verbal substitute, do and do so, can be seen in thc following example:

[3:64]Shall I make ana.//^you/can do/Now/ announcement?b./^you can/do so/now/

In many instanccs either do or do so can occur, with only a slight differencc in meaning:the form with so combines anaphora with prominence, so that it has the effect of explicitness, of spccifying that it is precisely the verbal element mentioned carlier that is the point of information herc.But for this very rcason there are certain instances where so is obligatory.They are those where do is ReQuIReD to be the point of information because there is no element of contrast present, as in [3:63b] above.Elsewhere so is optional; and there are two conditions under which it cannot occur. Thc first of these is in a comparative clause with than or assuch as [3:56] and [3:61] above.In fact thc form with so is less frequcnt in all cases wherc the prcsupposing clause is structurally related to the presupposed one;so

[3:65] I want to read this documcnt.You can sign it aftcr I'vc done so.

is likely to mcan after I'vc rcad it'with thc tonic on done rathcr than after I've signed itwith thc tonic on $I ^ { ' } \nu e )$ the lattcr mcaning would more probably be cxpressed as after I have doue. Thc second condition where so cannot occur is if the goal is repudiated,as in 3:s8b].With thc provisos mentioned herc, the verbal substitute may take either form, and the choice bet ween do and do so is oftcn made at the phonological level, on purely rhythmic grounds: bccause thc one form fits into the rhythm of thc sentencc more smoothly and cffcctively than thc other.

# 3.3.2 Conditions of use of the verbal substitute

There is considerablc variation in the use of the substitute do in contemporary English. It appcars to havc evolved by analogy with the nominal substitute one, but to bc lagging somewhat behind one in range of uscs, perhaps because cllipsis is almost always an acceptable altcrnativc. In Shakespearean English, the verbal substitute do was much less clcarly distinct from thc finite verbal operator do (see 3.3.3.4 below bccause of the morc gcncral use of the latter in a positive declarative verbal group, egas I do live Modern English as I live).Clear instances of thc verbal substitutc in Shakcspeare almost always have the form do so.In the following cxamplcs, thc do would be a substitute in Modern English; but hcre it was probably in fact an operator:

[3:66] a.Ncver a woman in Windsor knows morc of Anne's mind than I do. b.Thou makest a testament as worldlings do.

As a very broad generalization, thc vcrbal substitute is used more in speech than in writing, and more in British than Amcrican English. Within each of thc varictics therc arc wide dialcctal and individual differences. In British English it can substitutc for any verb except beand in most dialects cxcept have in thc sensc of 'possessthose verbs substitute for themselves:

[3:67] a. I've bccn very rcmiss about this.- I think we all havc been, at times. b.I've had serious doubts about this.-I think we all have had, at times. c.I had serious doubts about this.-I think we all had, at times.

In c),Amcrican and somc British spcakcrs would substitute had by did but probably no spcakcrs of English would substitutc been by done in a). In American English on thc othcr hand, do docs not generally substitute for vcrbs of the seem class; in British English it docs providcd thc following Attribute is within thc domain of the substitution and is not rcpudiated:

a. She always uscd to doI remember. [3:68] Paula looks very happy b.She sccms happier now than shc did last time we met.

Manypossibly all, Amcrican speakers would find do in a and did in b) both impossible; thcy would prefer thc clliptical form used to in a and the repetition of seemed in(b).

There is another factor lcading to a considerable diffcrentiation between British and Amcrican speakers in their use of thc verbal substitute, onc which is present in [3:68a andin factin most of thc cxamples of do that have been cited up to now.This relates to the structurc of the verbal group in the prcsupposing clausc. If this consists of onc word only simple past or prcsent tense in positive declarative mood), thcn both American and British spcakers regularly usc the substitute; eg:does in

Bccause such examples are easily confused with the finitc vcrbal operator do wc have been avoiding them up to now. The difference will be discusscd in 33.3.4 below.) If it consists of more than one word, so that the substitute would appear following one or morc auxiliaries (in the form do, doing,or done),American spcakers prefer thc clliptical form in which the lexical verb is not substituted but simply omitted. In [3:57], for example thc preferred form in American English is he might have; and in 3:61a-d] clliptical forms would be expected throughoutand likewise in[3:67a andb].

If the presupposing verbal group is non-finite, ellipsis is undcr most circumstances impossiblc. The rule is that an imperfective non-finite verbal group (those in thc participial'form -ing,eggoinghaving gone cannot be elliptical;a pcrfcctive onc thosc in thc infinitive'form with toeg:to goto have gonecan bc elliptical only if ncgative,or if following another verb eg:want to go or cataphoric it.For examplc,in [3:70], d)c and f could bc elliptical,whcrcas a),b and c could not

a.Having done so I feel better. b.I felt bad at not having done so before. c.To do so sccmed only courteous. [3:70]I fnally called d.Not to do so) would havc been dison him. courteous. e.I have wanted to (do so)) for a long time. f.It secmed only courtcous to (do so).

In a-(c both American and British English would usc thc substitutc, with American prcfcrring the form do so if there is any choice. In d)-(f) Amcrican English tends to use thc clliptical form, or else thc substitutc with so,whereas British spcakcrs sclcct among all three, at lcast in d) and (c)with perhaps some prefcrencc for the one with do alonc.In a), $( c )$ and (f) the substitute do cannot occur without so.for the reasons given carlier: there is no contrasting clcment prcsent.In b),d and (e) the contrast is provided by not and by wanted.) There are thus minor but still interesting differences between different varicties of English revolving around thc nature and potential of verbal substitution.

The domain of vcrbal substitution as remarkcd in 33.1 above, is the lexical verb togcthcr with such other elemcnts in thc clause as are not repudiated by some contrasting item. In principle any clement can be rcpudiated in this way, although certain pattcrns, particularly those in which a Complement is rcpudiated,sound a little awkward, and ellipsis, wherc it is possible,secms to fit them better than substitution; this is illustratcd by the examples in [3:71] and cf[3:58] above:

3:71] a.Can lions climb trces-No,but lcopards can do. b.Can lions kill elephants?-Nobut they can do giraffes. c.Havc they given thc lions thcir meat?-Nobut thcy have done thc cheetahs. d.Can lions kill with their tails?-No,but they can do with thcir paws.

In a) it is thc Subject that is repudiatedin b} and c a Complement dircct object'and 'indirect objectand in d an Adjunct.The only clcmcnt in the clause that cannot be repudiatcd is the Attribute;[3:72] is impossible, andcohesion could be achieved hcrc only lexically, by repetition of the verb seemed:

3:72|Did the lions seem hungry?-No,but they did restless.

There are certain contexts,howevcr,in which irrespective of its function in the modal structurc a particular clement in the clause cannot be repudiated, so that it is not possible to presuppose the verb without this other element also falling within the domain of the presupposition. In [3:73]thc clausc containing a verbal substitute is not acceptablc following (i in cach instance, although it is acceptable following (i [3:73] a. Shc's never lived in England. She has done in France. (ii She's never sung in England. b.i You mustn't put them on the tablc. You can do on thc ii) You mustn't cut them on the table.S bcnch. c.i The door was shutting. The windows were do(iThe door was falling to pieces.J ing too. d. (i) We can't shut the door. We might do the win(ii We can't smash in the door. dows.

The reason is that in (i) therc is a strong expectancy binding the repudiated element to the one that is prcsupposed by the substitute. For example, live expects a locative;hencc it cannot be substituted without at the samc time carrying over any itcm having a Location'function that is structurally associated with it. This does not apply to sing, which has no such expectancy.Nor does it apply to live in company with other types of Adjunct; there is no difficulty about

[3:74] You can't live on what they would pay you.You could do on twice as much,maybe

The same principle lics behind the other examples; put also presupposes a locative and so cannot be substituted without entailing the 'Location Adjunct, whereas cut shows no such restriction. In c) and (d there is a collocational expectancy between door and shut,so we cannot substitute shut without also prcsupposing door; noticc that it makcs no difference whether the door is Subject or Complement - the rclcvant role is that of Medium, which is common to both instances.Thc restriction does not apply to smash in or fall to pieces, which can be substituted on their own whilc still allowing the door to be repudiatcd. All these arc instances of patterns of expectancy between i the Process-action,cvent,etc-and (ii a particular role that is related to it in the structure such as Location or Mcdium, or a particular item or class of items that functions in that rolc, eg: door as Medium in rclation to the Process shut. An item standing in this relation to the proccss cannot bc cxcluded from the domain of a verbal substitution.

It is the repudiation of other clements in the structure which provides the contrastive environmcnt within which the substitution takes place.In [3:71],for exampleeach pair of clauses represents a particular distribution of clements into the presupposed, which are within the domain of the substitutionand the contrasted, which are repudiated from this domain:

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="7"></td><td></td><td>Presupposed</td><td>Contrasted</td></tr><tr><td>[3:71]a.</td><td>can climb trees</td><td>lions:leopards</td></tr><tr><td>b.</td><td>lions can kill</td><td>elephants: giraffes</td></tr><tr><td>C.</td><td>they have given meat</td><td>to lions:to chcetahs</td></tr><tr><td>d.</td><td>lions can kill</td><td>with tails:with paws</td></tr></table></body></html>

We havc illustrated this by reference to clcments in the structure of the clause, but the same principle operates within the verbal group: thc contrast may occur within the systems associated with thc verb itself, such as tcnsc,polarity and modality.So for cxample:

[3:75] Have you callcd the doctor?- I haven't done yct, but I will do.-I think you should do.

Here thc lexical verb call is presupposed throughout, but thcrc is repudiation first of the polarity ncgative haven't contrasting with positive have) then of the tense (future will contrasting with past in present have...-ed), and finally of the modality modalized should contrasting with nonmodalized).The one system that is subject to restriction hcre is that of voice, for the reason that substitution is not possible in thc passive.Normally thercfore there is no change of voicc between the prcsupposed and thc presupposing clause; both are active. It is possible however for a passive verbal group to be substituted in the active,for examplc

[3:76] Has the doctor been called by anyone?-I don't know.I haven't done.Maybe someonc clse has done.

There is a tendency in the history of English for activc forms of thc verb, which evolve first, to bc matched by corresponding passive forms after an interval; this has happened consistently with thc tensc systen, and it may be that we are just beginning to sce verbal substitution introduced in the passive. In general, however,while ellipsis occurs in the passive in the normal way, subject to exactly thc same principles as in the activc, substitution docs not.

In other respccts, all thc preceding discussion applics to ellipsis as much as it docs to substitution, and many speakers would tcnd to prcfcr elliptical forms in many of thc examples citcd.It is safe to asscrthowever, that many peoplc who reject the substitutc whcn thcir attention is drawn to it actually make frequent use of it in thcir own spccch, including in those very contexts in which they claim not to do.) Wc have stresscd all along that ellipsis and substitution are csscntially the same relation, so that it is not surprising to find both as alternative forms of cohesion in broadly the same range of contexts. In the next chapter we shall bring up various other contexts in which thcre is no cxplicit substitution but only ellipsis.

With respect to the use of the substitute, thc proviso madc in the previous section concerning do and do so applics equally whcre the contrast is within the verbal group.Whcrever thc focus of information is required to fall on the Head of the verbal group- the lexical verb itself,as opposed to an auxiliary - the substitute takcs the form do so.This is somctimes determined by thc context, but sometimes appcars as an indepcndent choice, as in

[3:77] Why do you smile?. /1/ didn't / know I/ was doing b./I/didn't/know I was/DOING so $1 1$ where the answer (a) treats thc polarity-tcnse complex present in past, positive) as the focus of information, and hence treats smnile as simply given, while (b) focuses on smile as precisely the element in which the information resides.Thcre is one other condition which tends to imposc prominencc on the lexical verb and thus to dcmand do so as the substitutc form: this is when the mood of the presupposing clause is other than declarativc, ie when it is interrogative or imperative. The reason is that if the verb in an interrogative or imperativc clause is anaphoric, the contrast normally residcs in thc mood itsclf, and hencc is located within the verbal group:

a. Haven't you done so [3:78] Shall I call the doctor?b.When will you do so? c.Please do so, as soon as possible.

Thc various conditions on thc use of the verbal substitutc,lcaving aside variations betwcen different forms, such as do so and door zero, and betwcen diffcrent dialects or individual speakcrs, resolve themselves into what are esscntially manifestations of thc sanc underlying principlc: that of continuiry in the environnent of contrast. The continuity, obviously, is provided by substitution as a cohesivc agency:the replacement of the verb by a substitution counter signalling that the relevant item is to be recovered from elsewhere.But, as in nominal substitution, the significance of this continuity lics in the fact that its context is one of noncontinuity. or contrast:somc cntity or circumstance associatcd with thc process expressed by the verb, or somc internal condition of tine, mood, polarity or the like, is not as it was in the prcvious instance.This is thc major distinction between thc mcanings of substitution and refcrencc as cohesive devices; see Chapter 7 bclow.)

It follows that if thcrc are certain clcments so closely bonded with the Process that thcy cannot be varicd while thc latter is kept constant they cannot providc a contrasting environment, and hcncc cannot be repudiated under conditions of substitution. Wc referred to thcsc above.It should follow also that thc continuity that is being expressed,since it is in the environnent of contrast, is not merc rcference back but positive confirmationa marking of the fact that the lcxical verb still holds good. This can bc seen to be thc case,if we consider onc further set of examples.

[3:79] a. Smith isn't playing tiddlywinks for his health.He is doing) for money. b.Were you talking to me?-No,I was doingto myself.

By any normal intcrprctation these are wrong.Instead of substitution, some form of reference should have been uscd:he's doing it or he's playing in a),I was talking to nyself in b).Why? Because the substitute form of a mcans Yes he is playing, but it's for moneyits information structure is that of What Sith is doing $=$ playing tiddlywinks, and for money.This applies to both the elliptical form and that with thc verbal substitute doing.The required meaning howevcr is $\mathrm { { } ^ { 4 } N o }$ hes playing only for moneywith the information structure of What Smith is playing tiddlywinks for $=$ money. In othcr words, the proccss playing tiddlywinks is not part of thc information contcnt of thc messagc;it is not marked out for confirmation,but mcrely used as a pcg on which to hang the information contained in for money.Similarly in b) the information structure is not What I was doing $=$ talking,but to myselfwhich is what substitution implics,but The one I was talking to =myse!f.This demonstrates the principlc on which substitution is based,and explains the typcs of limitation that there are on its use.

Like thc nominal substitute one, the vcrbal substitute $d \sigma$ is one of a number of related items:lexical verbpro-vcrb'and so on.A summary account of thesc is given in the next section.

# 3.3.3 The word do other than as substittte

In addition to functioning as the verbal substitute, the verb do occurs in

Modern English as lexical verb,gcneral verbpro-verb'and verbal operator. Thcse are all related to each other and form a continuum, or at least a clustcr, of meanings that shade into one another at the edges, yielding various indeterminate instanccs.But the distinctions are significant for the construction of text, so wc will discuss each of these forms briefly in turn3.3.3.1-3.3.3.4

# 3.33.I LEXICAL VERB do

This is an ordinary verb of thc English languagc, found in examples such as he has done the jobI have work to do, let's do the accounts.Other than in two special mcaningsi as in do well do badly,(ii as in that will do, will it do?,it will never do to let then know,it is always transitive:it has an inherent Goal. In an activc clausc this Goal functions as a Complement of the 'direct object' type; and sincc under normal circumstances in English the Goal-Complement cannot bc omitted if the Head verb is exprcssed (eg wc cannot say Have you mended the garage door yet?-Yes, I've mended.), this hclps in distinguishing lexical do from substitute do. The doing in [3:8o] must bc the verbal substitute.

[3:80] He ought to be doing his homework.-He is doing.

Ifit had been lexical do the form would have been He's doing it.This would have been recognizable as not being the substitute because of the tonic prominence in doing, the reduced forn of is, and the presence of the noncontrastivc Complement it -as we have seen, only contrasting items can occur in thc cnvironment of the substitute do except as Subject, since English normally requires the Subject to bc made explicit in indicative clauses whether linked by presupposition or not). Likewise if the answer had becn in the passive, eg: it's being done now,this could only be lexical do.It is perhaps worth remarking here on thc fact that substitute do.can substitute for lexical do in thc same way as it can for other verbs

Ambiguity may arise whcrc a Complement is present as in [3:81] I don't think he likes his new cmployer much.-Nobut hc does his job.

where does could cithcr be a substitutc for likes (he likes his job or Iexical do in the cxprcssion do the job.

Lexical do has in itself no cohesive significance, other than through rcpetition (Chapter 6.

# 3.3.3.2 GENERAL VERB do

This is a member of a small class of verbs, cquivalent to the class of general nouns referred to in 3.2 and discussed in 6.1 bclow).They arc lexical itcms with generalized mcanings.This form do occurs in expressions such as they did a dance, meaning simply they dancedthey do lunches they provide lunchesit does no harm.Other verbs in thc class include make, as in nake a mistake crrhave as in have a bath bathetake in take exception to.An example from Alice:

3:82 A little kindncss-and putting her hair in papers-would do wonders with her.'

# 3.333 PRO-VERB dO

Again this class corresponds to an cquivalent nominal class, that of pro-nouns 3.2.3.4 above.Thc only mcmbers of the class of pro-verb are do and happen.These stand for any unidentified or unspccified process, do for actions and happen for cvents or for actions encodcd receptively, in some kind of passive form. Thcir occurrence does not necessarily involve an anaphoric or cataphoric refcrence; there is nothing cohesive about their use in the following examples:

[3:83] a.What was she doing-She wasn't doing anything b.What's happening?-Nothing's happening. c.What an I to do?'exclaimed Alice,looking about her in great pcrplexity.

However,pro-verb do is often used endophorically,in that it functions as a carrier for anaphoric items, especially it and that. Thc expressions do that do it in fact function as reference itcms; there are no reference verbs'in the language, so we say he did it bccause we cannot say he itted, and he does that because we cannot say he thats.Examples:

[3:84 a.'She's tiredpoor thing'said thc Red Queen.Smooth her hair - lend her your nightcap - and sing her a soothing lullaby.' 1 haven't got a nightcap with mesaid Alice, as shc tried to obey the first dircction:and I don't know any soothing Iullabics' I must do it myself, thensaid thc Rcd Qucen. b.Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open hcr mouth; but shc did it at last, c.They lived on trcaclc, said thc Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two.

They couldn't have done that, you knowAlice gcntly remarked:theyd havc bcenill. So they were, said thc Dormouse very ill d.Whcnever the horsc stoppcd which it did,vcry often,hc fell off in front.

Thc mcchanism of cohesion, in such instances, is through the usc of the rcfercnce items it and thatbut it is really thc verbal group as a whole that refers back.so that we could regard do it and do that as conpound refcrence verbs. An cccurrence of do that constitutes a singlc cohesive tic,not two.

It is the pro-verb do that occurs in thc cxpressions do the same 3.2.5.2) and do so 3.3.1.It combincs with thc pro-noun thing in the exprcssions do somcthing-anything-notling-a. thing and semantically the samc clementwhat...do? Herc it often occurs in cataphoric contexts, for example:

[3:85]The first thing I've got to dosaid Alice to hcrsclf...is to grow to my right sizc again.

The pro-verb do occurs regularly in the passive,for cxamplc [3:86 I told someone to feed the cat. Has it bcen done?

the activc cauivalent being Has someone done it? Here it refers anaphorically to thc fecding of thc catthis is thc it with extendcd reference f2.3.3.1 above,[2:18])and it is pcrhaps worth pointing out thc distinction bctween a pro-verb do with this typc of it and a gencral verb do with it in a simple pronominal context.In example [3:87]

[3:87 I want to make a papcr chain.But it can't bc donc in a hurry.

the second clausc is ambiguous it is either i it the making of a paper chain can't be done pro-verb in a hrryor ii ita paper chain cant be done general verb,made in a hrry. The distinction is clcar in thc plural:

[3:88 I want to make some iBut it can't bc done in a hurry. paper chains. iiBut thcy can't bc done in a hurry.

Thc pro-verb do in combination with a rcfcrence itcm it, this or that may bc anaphoric to any proccss of thc action typc.Thc gcncral verb do is anaphoric only by lexical cohesion,in that it stands as a synonym for a set of more spccific verbs, as in do stms do an essay do the vegetablesor combines with them in their nominalized forms, as in do the cookingdo the writing,and therefore coheres with such items if thcy have occurred in the preccding text.All such anaphoric instances of gcneral verb or pro-verb do arc instances of reference,not of substitution.

# 3.33.4 VERBAL OPERATOR do

The last of thc words having the form do is the finite verbal opcrator or auxiliary'This is in principle totally distinct from all the othcrsin that it is a purely granmatical clement whose function is to exprcss simple present or past tense in spccific contexts:vhcn intcrrogative do you know)ncgative you dont know or marked positivc you do know for example

[3:89]Docs she sing-Shc docsnt sing.-She does sing.

This do is always finite, and always occurs as first word in the verbal group; it can ncver represent the lexical clcment in the process (the 'Thing').

It would therefore be totally distinct from substitutc do were it not for the fact of ellipsis. [3:89] might bc rcwritten as

[3:9oDoes she sing-Noshe doesnt.-Ycs,shc does.

wherc she docsn't and she does are elliptical forms having the operator do as Head.The distinction bctween this and substitution appears in:

a.Ycs,she does. [3:91] Docs shc sing? b.No,but Mary does [3:91a is clliptical; does is the opcrator andsince it is clliptical, sing or thc substitutc do could be added aftcr it:she does singshe does do.3:91b is a substitutc form;sing could not be addcd after does, but it could replacc itNobut Mary sings. In speech the-two types arc more distinct than in writing,bccause thc substitute do is wcak whereas the operator do is salicnt if it is final in thc verbal group ie,if clliptical in thc dcclarativc.An elliptical intcrrogative form.such as Does Mary?,is quitc unambiguous because the substitute could never occur in this forin: the interrogative of Mary does,with does as substitute, is does Mary do?consisting of Operator $^ +$ Mary $^ +$ substitute as Head).

The auxiliary do is not itself in any scnse a cohesive agent. But the type of elliptical verbal group in which the operator occurs alone is extremcly frequent, and this of course is cohesive by virtuc of being elliptical. This is discussed in 4.3.

# 3-3.4Summary of uses of do

The set of related words do can be illustrated in the following passage:

[3:92] What's John doing thesc days?1John's doing a full-timc job at the works. (2) That'll do him good. 3 Im glad he's doing something.4Docs hc like it there?5 He likes it more than I would ever do.

Here (1) contains thc lexical verb $d o , ( 2 )$ thc general verb,3 thc pro-verb, which is also prescnt in the original question,(4) thc operator and (s) thc substitute.

Table 6 gives a summary of the items discussed in this scction. Of thosc listed,1 and 2 are substitutes, and are thc subjcct of this chapter they are normally cohesive (sec bclow).3) and 4 arc lexical items and are cohesive only in the special context of lexical cohcsion; see Chapter 6. (5)thepro-verbis not in itsclf cohesive; but it rcgularly combines with reference items, particularly it and that, to form what is in effect a verb of reference which is typically anaphoric and cohesive. (6), the verbal operator, likewise has no cohesive force; but it figures promincntly in elliptical forms of the verbal group which are themselves cohesive by virtuc of the ellipsis; see Chapter 4.

The substitute do is almost always anaphoric; it may presuppose an clcment within the samc sentence as itself, so that thcre is already a structural relation linking the prcsupposed to the presupposing clauses; but it frequently substitutcs for an clement in a preceding sentence, and therefore it is, like the nominal substitute, a primary source of cohesion within a text. Only occasionally is it cataphoric, and thcn only within the sentencc, and so making no contribution to cohesion; an example is [3:93] Since I havc done, will you join too?

It occurs cxophorically under appropriate conditions, for example a warning to someone who has been caught doing something forbidden:

[3:94] I shouldn't do,if I was you.

Here the spcaker is simulating a textual relation in order to suggest that the action in question is already under discussion. But its prinary function is anaphoric, and it is a rich source of continuity in everyday linguistic interaction.

There is onc further typc of substitution, that of a clause, which is discussed in thc next scction3.4)

# 3.4 Clausal substitution

Thcrc is one further type of substitution in which what is presupposed is not an clcment within thc clause but an entirc clausc. Thc words uscd as substitutes arc so and not.For yes and no see 3.4.3.1 and 4.4.3 bclow.

# 3.4.1. Difference between clansal and other types of substitution

We pointed out at the beginning of the chaptcr that,sincc substitution is a formal rclationcontrasting in this respect with rcfcrcnce which is a scmantic onc, a substitute typically has thc same structural function as that for which it is substituting.So, for cxample, one functions as Head of a nominal group and substitutes for a noun which was Head of a nominal group. In thc samc way do functions as Hcad of a verbal group and substitutes for a verb which was Head of a verbal group.

In thc case of do, howevcr, the substitution may cxtcnd over othcr elcments in the clause: any complements or adjuncts that arc not repudiated fall within the domain of thc substitute do.Thc verb do thus comes close to functioning as a substitutc for an cntire clause,but for the rule of English grammar which requires the Subjcct to be made explicit. In an example such as

[3:9s] The children work very hard in thc garden.-They must do.

the children falls within what is presupposed in the second sentence as clearly as the other elements do, but it has to be cxpressed by the personal pronoun they.

Howcver,do is not a clausal substitute.This is not bccause of the rcquiremcnt of a Subject,but for anothcr. more significant rcason:namely that with do thc contrastivc clement which provides the context for the substitution is located within the same clause. It may be within or outside the verbal group, but it is always in the clausc itself. This was illustrated in 3:58 abovc.Although other elements may fall within its domain, do is a verbal not a clausal substitute.

In clausal substitution the cntirc clause is prcsupposcd, and thc contrasting clement is outside the clausc.For cxample,

[3:96] Is there going to be an carthquake-It says so.

Here the so presupposes the wholc of thc clause there's going to be an earthquake, and the contrastive cnvironment is providcd by the says which is outside it.

There are thrcc cnvironments in which clausal substitution takcs place: report, condition and modality.In each of these environmcnts it may takc cither of two forms,positive or negative; the positive is cxpressed by so, the negative by not. We shall considcr each of these in turn.

# 3.4.I.I SUBSTIIUTION OF REPORTED CLAUSES Here are thrcc cxamples from Alice:

[3:97 a..if you've scen thcm so oftenof course you know what they're like'. I bclicve so,'Alice replicd thoughtfully. b.How am I to get in?'askcd Alicc again in a loudcr tone. Are you to get in at all?'said the Footman.That's thc first questionyou know. It was,no doubt:only Alice did not like to be told so. c.'The trial cannot proceed said thc King in a very grave voice,until all thc jurymen arc back in thcir proper placesall' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he said so.

Ina)so substitutes for thatI know what they re likeinb)for that was the first questionand in $( c )$ for all'.As examplec shows,the presupposed clement may bc in the quoted form direct specch).

The reported clause that is substituted by so or not is always declarative, whatever the mood of the presupposed clause.There is no substitution for interrogative or imperative (indircct questions or commands),and therefore the clausc substitutes do not occur following verbs such as wonder,order or ask.

The cssential distinction to be made hcrc is that between rcports and facts.This is a complex distinction, but it is fundamental to language and is reflected in thc linguistic system in very many ways.Broadly speaking, facts and rcports are those elcmcnts in a linguistic structurc which represent not the phenomena of expericnce thcmselves-persons,objects,actions, events, etc-likc childrenthrow'and stones'in the children were throwing stones, but such phcnomena already encoded in language, for example 'the fact that the children were throwing stoncs'as in the fact that the children were throwing stones displeased their parents. These encodings then participate in linguistic structures in thc normal way, as this example illustrates, although there are clear restrictions on thc types of clause into which they can enter.

What matters here is that these encodings arc of two kinds: facts, and reports. The two are rathcr diffcrent, though they arc not always easy to tell apart. Facts are phenomena that are encoded at thc scmantic level, as meanings; reports are phenomcna encoded at the lexicogrammatical level, as wordings.Report corresponds more or less to the concept of speech' in direct spceech' and indirect speech.Herc arc somc examples of both; those in column i are reports, those in column (ii) are facts:

[3:98] (iReport ii)Fact   
a.Mary said:'John's late.   
b. Mary's assertion: John is late.'   
c.Mary said that John was late. Mary resented that John was late.   
d.Mary's assertion that John was Mary's resentment that John was late. late.   
C. Mary resented John's lateness.   
f. It was that John was latc that Mary resented.   
g. Mary was afraid that John was late. Mary was angry that John was late.   
h.Mary's fear that John was late.   
J. That John was late angered Mary.

It will be seen that, although thc typical form of expression for facts and reports is the same,as illustratcd in (c)(d) and $( \mathrm { g } )$ there are other realizations which are restricted to onc or the othcr. The restrictions are not as totally clearcut as they have bcen made to appear here, because other factors are involved as well; but thcy are valid in general, and they follow fromi the general distinction bctween fact as meaning and report as wording.

This last formulation should not be takcn to imply that a report always follows the exact wording of what was said, or that there necessarily was an act of speaking corresponding to it. Reports are associatcd with thinking as well as with saying.It merely means that facts are scmantic structures while reports are lexicogrammatical structures. And this enables us to predict, what is actually the case,that reports can be substituted whereas facts cannot - since, as we have seen substitution is a lexicogrammatical relation.

Hcncc, corresponding to (c) and $\left( \underline { { \boldsymbol { \sigma } } } \right)$ we can have Mary said so,Mary was afraid so in colunn (i; but we cannot have Mary resented so or Mary was angry so in column (ii).The fact that so could not appcar in b and h is a purely structural limitation; wc cannot say Mary's fear so because here so would be a Qualificr within the nominal group, which is not a possible structural function for it.) The pattern appcars clearly with words that are used to introduce both facts and reports, eg: regret, which means either be sorry about the fact that'or bc sorry to say that;the substitutc can bc used only in thc latter sense. Facts can bc prcsupposed by reference, but not by substitution:

[3:99]a.Theyvc failcdthen-I regrct so. b.Thcy'vc failed.-I rcgret it.-Everyone rcgrcts it.

The negative form of thc clausal substitute is not, as in [310o] Has everyone gone home?\~I hope not.

However with some verbs negation tcnds to be transferred into thc reporting clause so that for example, the normal pattern of think plus negativc substitute is don't think so rather than think not $c f$ also I don't believe/suppose/magine so.Thc word not can be interprctcd as thc portmanteau' rcalization of the substitute and negative polarity.

All such expressions, positive and ncgative, are particularly frcquent in first person singular, where thcir meaning comes very close to that of expressions of modality (f3.4.1.3 bclow.Another example:

[31or] Of course you agree to have a battle'Tweedledum said in a calmcr tone. I suppose so,the other sulkily replied, as he crawled out of the umbrella.

There is some restriction on thc use of the substitutc in the context of expressions of certainty;wc say I'n afraid so but not $\vec { I ^ { \prime } m }$ stre so,you think not or you don't think so but not you know not or you don't know so.The samc rcstriction turns up with modality, though only in the positive; we say perhaps so but not certainly so, although here certainly not is regular and frcqucnt. This is perhaps correlated with the distinction between facts and reports: a report that has certainty ascribed to it strongly rescmbles a fact- unless the certainty lies in its negation.But the pattern is by no mcans a consistent one.

One typc of report in which substitution is espccially frequent is thc impersonal typc,eg:they say so/not it says sonot it seems/appears sonot including rather more restrictedly, thosc in the passive form: it was reported soit is said not.For example,

[3:102] Ought wc to declarc our winnings?-It says not.

There is a possibility of overlap bctween this structure and that in which so is substituting for an Attribute in a clause of ascription; for cxamplc, in

[3103]Is this mango ripe-It sccms so.

the answer is strictly speaking ambiguous:it may be this mango sccms ripewith personal reference iten it and so as nominal substitute, or it seems that this mango is ripe'with impcrsonal (non-anaphoric) it and so as clausal substitute. Thc distinction bccomes clcar in the plural:Are these mangoes ripe?-(i) They seem so.ii) It seems so.The difference in mcaning is slight, but it is easily perccived.Note that thc negative is not in both instances,i They seem not.ii It seems notshowing that both arc in fact substitution forms.

Finally,so as a report substitute occurs in initial position in expressions such as so it seems,so he said so I believe,so we were led to understand.This has the effect of making the so thcmatic in the clausc.Since negation when not combined with other meanings is rarely thematic in modern English, there is no equivalent negative form.

# 3.4.I.2 SUBSTITUTION OF CONDITIONAL CLAUSES

A sccond context for clausal substitution is that of conditional structure. Conditional clauses are frcquently substituted by so and not, espccially following $i f$ but also in other forms such as assuning sosuppose not

[3:1o4] a. Evcryone seems to think he's guilty.If so,no doubt he'll offer to resign. b.Wc should recognize the placc when wc come to it. Yes, but supposing not: then what do wc do?

Here so in a substitutes for he is guilty, not in b for wve don't recognize the place when we come to it.

# 3.4.I.3 SUBSTITUTION OF MODALIZED CLAUSES

Finally,so and not occur as substitutes for clauses expressing modality,eg [3:1os a.Oh,I beg your pardon!cricd Alicc hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animal's fcelings.I quitc forgot you didn't like cats.' Not like cats!cricd the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voicc.Would yon likc cats if you werc me? Well, perhaps not,' said Alicc in a soothing tone: ..

b.May I givc you a slicc?'shc said, taking up thc knife and fork, and looking from onc Quccn to thc other. Certainly notthc Rcd Queen saidvcry decidedly:it isn't ctiquctte to cut anyonc you've becn introduced to.Remove thejoint!'

Modality is the speaker's asscssment of the probabilitics inherent in thc situationas in a);or, in a dcrived scnsc,of the rights and duties as in b) These may be expressed cither by modal forms of the verb (will, would, cancouldHymightmstshouldis toand ought toor by modal adverbs such as perhapspossiblyprobablycertainlysurelythc lattcr arc frequently followed by a clausal substitute, with the proviso alrcady noted, that those expressing certainty do not accept substitution in thc positive, though they do in the negative.

# 3.4.2 Sinrilarity among the types of clausal substitution

We have distinguishcd the three types or contexts of clausal substitution: report, condition, and modality.It is important to emphasize, however, what thcy have in common.

To start from modality: there is considerable similarity in meaning between a modalized clause, on the one hand, and a reported clause dependent on a first person singular verb of cognition on the other; for cxample betwecn probably he's right and I suppose he's right -and hence between probably so and 1 suppose so. But I suppose is mcrely a special instance of someone supposes; and supposing is mercly one way of cognizing'a report among a set of possible ways including thinking, assuming believing,knowing and so on. The unmarkcd context for a report, however,is onc not of cognizing but of verbalizing: not of thinking,but of saying.Hcncc thcre is a semantic continuitya clincall thc way from probably he's right, through I think he's right and they think he's right to impersonal) they say he's right and Mary says he's right. All of thesc can bc substituted by so and, in the negative, by not.

Looked at from another anglc, however,a conditional clause is also scmantically related both to a rcported one and to a modalized one. The form if he's right means let us suppose hc's right; then ..';the condition may bc cxpressed by non-finitc (dcpendent) forms of verbs of cognition, such as supposing, assming (and in many languagcs by verbs of saying, equivalcnt to let it be said that... then....Likewise, we can interpret if he's right as a modality,similar to possibly hc's right; in that casc.. and again there is a modalized form for thc cxpression of a conditional should he be right,...

All three types have the property of being at onc remove from (statements of) reality; thcy are hypothetical. Modalizing, reporting and conditionalizing are all ways of assigning dependent status to the clause in question.This is reflected in thc structurc;rcported and conditional clauses arc both HyPOTACTIc but not embeddcd'(ie not RANKsHIFTED; it is this that is the relevant concept, since cmbedding' has not becn clearly distinguishcd from hypotaxis in much recent grammatical analysis).That is to say,such a clausc is DEPENDENT ON another clause but not structurally integrated into it;it is not A coNsrirueNT OF it. Since modality is normally exprcsscd within thc clause, by a modal Adjunct such as possibly, or by a modal opcrator in the verbal group such as may, there is no hypotaxis involved;but wherc modality is expressed by a separate clause, then the modalized clause is likcwisc hypotactically related to it, as in it may be that he's right.

This then is the general environment for clausal substitution. It occurs in the context of hypotaxis: a clause that is hypotactically related to anothcr clause may be substituted by so or not. Scmantically this hyporactic structure is the expression of dependent or hypothctical status, in the form of report, condition or modality; and thc possibility of substitution thcrcfore also extends to the othcr realization of this relation, namely a modalized clause in which thc modality is cxprcsscd simply by insertion of a modal Adjunct.

As with noninal and verbal substitution, thc kcy concept is onc of continuity in the environmcnt of contrast. It is not possible to substitute a clause which is functioning indcpendently, just bccause it is being repcated; in such instances it must be presupposed by reference, typically by it, this or that.Substitution is uscd in ordcr to display the clause as a repetition but in a contrastive context, one in which it is dependent on something else-a rcport,a condition,an opinion.As always,what we are calling contrast'is not necessarily a negation of the context that was there bcfore; therc may have been no such context, and cvcn if there was, the presupposing context may bc simply a reaffirmation of it. But there is always some redefinition of thc environment of thc presupposed clause; the speakcr or writer is cncoding the clause as itsclf recoverable but in a context which is non-recoverable. This is the underlying meaning of clausal substitution, and it relates it clearly to substitution in the other contexts,nominal and verbal.

# 3.4.3.Some related patterns

Therc are various patterns cither related to or in some way rescmbling clausal substitution which may be brought together for a bricf mcntion here. Thesc fall under two headings: forns of responsc, and other uses of so and not.

# 3.4.3.I RESPONSE FORMS

Thc following cxamples illustratc forms of response which could bc interprcted as substitution:

(i) (ii) [3:106] a. Hens lay eggs. So they do So do turkeys. b.Hens don't fly.So they don't! Nor/Neither do turkeys.

Those in column (ii) are responses which add a new Subject; the meaning is 'and $^ +$ (Subject) $^ +$ do so'.Sincc thcy have altcrnative forms turkeys do (so too turkeys don't do so either thcy can rcasonably be inter prcted as forms of verbal substitution of the do so type (3.3.2 above)with thc additional meaning of and, too This meaning is always present in the negative form nor and not in this structure it is present also as a component in the so, by virtue of its initial position $\langle c f$ the discussion of and'in Chapter s below).

The examples in column (i) arc cxclamatory responses, acknowledging new information and cxpressing agreement with it: now that you mention it, I see you're right'.

There is no meaning of 'and' here, but some speakers have an alternative form of the negative,namcly nor/neither they do!; and what may be a subset of the same speakcrs havc too in the positive, they do too!,more uscd in contexts of contradiction - perhaps this pattern has evolved through influcnce from the column (ii forms.The column (i expression as a whole is undoubtedly cohesivc; but it seems that the cohesion hcre is rather a matter of ellipsis, and that the so is being used in the non-cohesive sense oftruc (see next scction).Note that there is a superficially identical structure in which so is a refcrence item, meaning like thatas previously stated, $e g \left( c f \right)$ thc last sentence of example [3: 84c] above) :

[3:107] It cant havc helped very much, all that shouting.- So it didn't. It only made things worse.

The other response forms that need to bc mentioned are yes and no. These could bc thought of as clause substitutes; but they are really morc rcadily interpretablc as clliptical forms.See Chapter 4section 4.4.3for discussion of yes and no.) They express just the polarity option in thc clause, positive or ncgative, leaving thc remainder to be presupposed. It is important to make this clear: what is expressed by yes and no is thc polarity of the presupposing clausc, irrespcctive of the polarity of what it presupposes-thcy do not,as their dictionary cquivalents in some languages docxpress agrcement or disagrecment with what has gone before. Consequently the responsc yes means I am tired'no matter what thc polarity and mood of thc presupposed clause:

31o8a.Yourc tired. b.Are you tired? c.You're not tired?Yes. (I am tircd.) d. Aren't you tired? etc

Thc substitutes so and not are exactly parallel to yes and no in this rcspect so for example

[3:109] a. Is hc going to pass thc exam? (I hope so. (I hope hc is.) b. Isn't he going to pass the I'm afraid not.(I'm afraid cxam? he isn't.)

# 3.4.3.2 OTHER USES OF S0 AND

In Chapter 2 we discussed the usc of so as a reference item mcaning like this'or to this extent.There is no such thing as ncgative refcrencc, so the form not does not appear under this heading.

In Chapter s we shall deal with so as a conjunction, meaning consequently'.Hcrc too there is no related negative form.

In this chapter we have trcated so as a substitute, in nominal,verbal and clausal substitution, in which it stands for thc whole or part of another typically a prcccdingclause. Clausal substitution is thc only context in which so has a corresponding ncgative, namely not. It is also the only context in which not is a cohesive element; elsewhere it is simply the exprcssion of negative polarity.

In all these instances, so is cohesive.There remains one further usc of the word, in which it is not cohcsive, but simply has the meaning true. (This has alrcady been mcntioned in the last scction, as the interpretation Of so in So they do!)

It is this mcaning of so that is found in the cxpressions that is so,this being so,is that so?,and so on.Herc thc meaning is that is tructhat is the casc'That this is not thc substitute so is shown among othcr things by thc ncgative; the ncgative of that is so is ncver that is not, but only that is not sothat isnt so in substitution both forms would be cxpected to occur).The cohesivencss of cxpressions of tlis kind dcrives not from the so but from thc anaphoric refcrence item that orit.

In this sense so alnost always follows the verb be. It might be possible to intcrprct it seems so in this way but here there is the corresponding negative it seems not as alternative to it doesn't seen so.Morcover thc so in it seens so is typically non-tonic,which suggests thc unaccented,substitute form;whcreas the so following thc verb be is typically tonic eg:that is so,it's not so.The differcnce bctwecn thc two is shown by the fact that, by itsclf, it is so is not a possiblc responsc; [3:11o] is unacceptable:

[3:11o] Everyonc's lcaving.-It is so.

whercas it seens so would bc quitc acceptable. Perhaps in a scquence such as

[3:11] Everyonc's leaving.-It seems so.-It is so!

where thc contcxt sets the tonic on is and not on so, wc havc a true substi tute so following be but this is clearly a spccial case, and can bc felt to bc somewhat odd.

# 3.4.4Summary of uses of so

The mcanings of so arc summarized in Tablc 7.Of the items listed, 1-6 are all cohcsiveonly 7 is not.1 and 2) are reference items Chapter 2scctions 2.5.1 and 2.5.2).3 refers to the only use of so as a nominal substitute, as Attribute in ascriptive clauses such as they seem so.In4)so is the verbal substitute do sodiscussed in 3.3;for the form so do I, see 3.43.1.s) is so as the clausal substitute, in contcxts of report, condition and modality; this was trcatcd in 3.4.2.In (6) so is a conjunction (Chaptcr 5, especially s.6. In 7)so has the mcaning of true it is not cohesive, and so not discussed in dctail, but thc forms it is so and so they dowere mentioned briefly in scctions 3.4.3.1 and 3.4.3.2.

As a clausal substitute,so is almost always anaphoric,cxactly as are all substitutes.Likc the others, it may presuppose an elemcnt to which it is already structurally related;but since it itself substitutes for a clause, thc only conditions under which this can occur are thosc of structural relations between clauses, paratactic as in [3:112a],or hypotactic as in [3:112b]:

[3:112] a. He may come but he didn't say so. b.He'll comc if he said so.

where so substitutes for he would come in each casc. (Note that in (a may is the realization of possibly $^ +$ future'; thc substitute presupposes the future' but not the modality.) Such instances derive their cohesion internally from the structurc.Even more frequcntly than the other substitutes, however, so prcsupposcs across the sentence boundary, and hence functions as the primary mcans of textual cohesion. Cataphoric instances are infrequent but by no means impossible:

[3:113] If he said so,hell come.

But it is difficult to construct cxophoric examples, because of the particular nature of the contrastive contexts - report, condition and modality - in which clausal substitution occurs. As was mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, substitution is fundamentally a textual relation; the primary meaning is anaphoric, and a substitute is used cxophorically only when the speakcr wants to sinulate the textual relation in order to create an effect of somcthing having already been mentioncd. This rarely happens where the presupposition extends over the mcaning of an entire clausc.

Substitution forms are summarized in Table 8.

# Chapter 4

Ellipsis

4.1Ellipsis, substitution and refercncc

In onc sense, the break bctween Chapters 3 and $4$ is an unnatural one, bccause substitution and ellipsis arc very similar to each othcr.As we expressed it earlier, cllipsis is simply 'substitution by zero'

For practical purposes,howevcr, it is more hclpful to treat thc two separatcly.Although substitution and cllipsis embody the same fundamental relation betwecn parts of a text (a relation between words or groups or clauses-as distinct from rcference, which is a relation between meanings), they are two different kinds of structural mechanism, and hence show rather diffcrent patterns.

The starting point of the discussion of cllipsis can be thc familiar notion that it is something left unsaid'There is no implication here that what is unsaid is not understood;on the contrary, unsaid'impliesbut understood neverthelessand anothcr way of referring to ellipsis is in fact as somETHING UNDERsTOOD, whcre understood is used in the spccial scnse of going without sayingcomparc it is understood that we are to be consulted before any agreement is reached).

There is no mystery in the fact that much can be understood'in this way.As we have stressed all along, language does not function in isolation;it functions as Text, in actual situations of use.There is always a great deal morc evidencc available to the hcarer for interprcting a scntence than is containcd in the sentencc itself. Howcvcr, it is important hcre to distinguish between two different kinds of evidence from which we may to use another familiar term supply'what is left unsaid.Only onc of these is associated with ellipsis: that where there is somc presupposition, in the structure, of what is to be supplied.

Consider an example such as [4:1] Hardly anyone left the country before thc war.

In order to intcrpret this, we should probably want to know whcther country meant rural areas hence'hardly anyone moved into the towns or national unitif the latter, which country was being rcferred to, and whcther left meant emigrated' orwent abroad on holiday'which war; whethcr hardly anyone refcrred to thc whole population, or a given social or family group; and so on.All this is relevant information if we want to understand this scntencc. But there is nothing in the structure of the sentencc to suggest that it has becn left out.There are two occurrences of the referencc itcm the, both of them probably gencralizcd cxophoric;but there is nothing to inake us feel that we must have nissed somc vital prcvious clause or sentence. The structure is not such as to presuppose any preceding text.

When we talk of ellipsis, we arc not referring to any and cvery instance in which there is somc information that the speaker has to supply from his own cvidence.That would apply to practically every scntencc that is ever spokcn or written, and would be of no hclp in explaining thc nature of a text.We arc rcferring specifically to sentences, clauscs, etc whose structure is such as to presuppose some preceding itcm, which then serves as the source of the missing information. An elliptical itcm is one which, as it were, leaves specific structural slots to be fillcd from elsewhere.This is exactly the same as presupposition by substitution, except that in substitution an cxplicit countcr'is used, eg: one or do,as a place-marker for what is presupposed, whereas in ellipsis nothing is inserted into the slot. That is why we say that ellipsis can be regarded as substitution by zero.

For examplc,

[4:2] Joan brought some carnations, and Catherinc some swect peas.

The structure of the second clause is Subject and Complement. This structure normally appears only in clauses in which at least one elcment, the Predicator,is presupposed,to be supplied from the preceding clausc.Note that thcre is no possiblc altcrnativc interpretation here; the second clause can bc intcrprctcd only as Catherine brought some sweet peas.

There thc two clauses are structurally related; the second is BRANCHED. Now consider

[4:3] Would you like to hear anothcr vcrse?I know twclvc more.

Here there is no structural relationship bctwcen the two parts.The second scntence contains a nominal group tivelve more,consisting of a Numerative only, for which we havc to supply a Head noun verses presupposed from the first sentence.Again,a nominal group having a Numerative but no

Head will normally be found only in contexts of presupposition. To give a slightly morc complex example:

[4:4] And how many hours a day did you do lessonssaid Alice, in a hurry to change the subject. Ten hours the first daysaid thc Mock Turtle: nine thc next, and so on.

Thc nominal group nine is presupposing,meaning nine hours, and so is the next mcaning the next day.The two clauses nine the next and ten hours the first day are also both presupposingrepresenting we did lessons ten hours the first day, etc. In all these cxamples the clauses and the nominal groups display structures that clearly show them to be presupposing.

Wherc thcre is ellipsis,there is a presupposition,in thc structurc,that something is to bc supplied, or understood'This is not quite thc same thing as saying that we can tellfrom the structure of an item whcther it is clliptical or not.For practical purposes we often can; but it is not in fact the structure which makes it elliptical.An item is elliptical if its structure does not express all the features that have gone into its make-up -all the meaningful choices that are embodicd in it.

In other words, we can take as a general guide the notion that cllipsis occurs when something that is structurally necessary is left unsaid; there is a sensc of incompletencss associated with it. But it is useful to recognize that this is an over-simplification, and that the esscntial characteristic of ellipsis is that something which is present in the sclection of underlying (systemic) options is omitted in thc structure- whcther or not the resulting structure is in itself'incomplete'.

Like substitution, ellipsis is a relation within thc text, and in the great majority of instanccs the presupposed item is prescnt in thc preceding text. That is to say, ellipsis is normally an anaphoric rclation.Occasionally the presupposition in an elliptical structure may be exophoric - we noted in Chapter 3 that this could also happen with substitution. If a housewife on secing thc milkman approach calls out Two please! she is using exophoric cllipsis;it is the context of situation that provides the information needed to interpret this.But exophoric cllipsis has no place in cohcsion, so we shall not explore it any further hcre.

Let us summarize here the general features of refercnce, substitution and ellipsis, harking back to what was said in the final paragraph of Chapter 3.All three are forms of presupposition, devices for identifying something by referring it to something that is already there -known to, or at least recoverable by,the hcarer.Since this 'something'that is presupposed may bc an clement in a preceding sentence, these devices have a cohcsive cffcct thcy contributc very largely to cohesion within the text.

Reference is prcsupposition at the semantic level. A reference item signals that the mcaning is recovcrable, though not necessarily in the form of the actual word or words required.For this reason a reference item cannot necessarily be replaced by what it presupposes; even if the presupposed item is present in the text, thc rcference to it may require an item of a different function in structure.At its simplest, reference is a form of situational (exophoric) presupposition;but it is regularly used in textual (endophoric) prcsupposition, pointing backwards anaphoric) or somctimes forward (cataphoric).In many styles of discoursc,including almost all written language,reference is always textual rather than situational.

Substitution, and here we include ellipsis as a special casc of substitution, is presupposition at the level of words and structures.When a substitute is used, it signals that the actual item required the particular word or group or clause, is recoverable from the environment; and thc substitute preserves the class of the presupposed item, which may thcrefore be replaced in the 'slotcreated by it. The difference between substitution and cllipsis is that in the former a substitution counter occurs in the slot, and this must thereforc be deleted if thc presupposed item is replaced,whcrcas in the latter the slot is cmpty - there has been substitution by zero.Unlike refercnce, substitution is essentially a textual rclation;it exists primarily as an anaphoric or occasionally cataphoric) dcvice, and in its rare exophoric use it tends to give an effect of putting the words in the othcr pcrson's mouth'.

In tabular form:

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Reference</td><td>Substitution and ellipsis</td></tr><tr><td>Level of abstraction</td><td>semantic</td><td>lexicogrammatical</td></tr><tr><td>Primary source of presupposition</td><td>situation</td><td>text</td></tr><tr><td>What is presupposed?</td><td>meanings</td><td>items(ie words, groups,clauses)</td></tr><tr><td>Is class preserved?</td><td>not necessarily</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Is replacement possible?</td><td>not necessarily</td><td>yes</td></tr><tr><td>Use as a cohesive devire</td><td>yes;anaphoric and cataphoric</td><td>yes;anaphoric (occas- sionally cataphoric)</td></tr></table></body></html>

Examples:

[4:5] a.This is a finc hall you have here. I'm proud to be lccturing in it. b.This is a fine hall you have here.I'vc never Icctured in a finer one. c.This is a fine hall you have hcrc. I've never lectured in a finer.

Examplc [4:5a] is refercnce. It would be possiblc to replacc it by some cxpression containing the word hall;but it would havc to bc altered from the original (egin this fine hall) and it still sounds somcwhat awkward. Examples b) and (c) arc substitution and ellipsisand it would be quite natural to add hall aftcr finer (deleting one in (b)).

In what follows, we shall discuss ellipsis under thrce headings:

Nominal ellipsis (4.2) Verbal ellipsis (4-3) Clausal ellipsis (4.4)

There is onc further gencral point to bc made first.We noted above,in Chapters 2 and 3,that a rcference item,or a substitute, may relatc to something in the same sentence, such that the presupposition takes place within the confines of a single structure.This is no diffrent in principle from any othcr instance of reference or substitution, though it may have certain special features, such as thc cataphoric rcfcrcnce of the to a qualificr in thc nominal group in example [2:61].But in the analysis of texts, relations within the sentence arc fairly adequately expressed already in structural terms,so that thcrc is no need to involve the additional notion of cohesion to account for how the parts of a sentencc hang together.

Betwccn sentences, however, thcre are no structural rclations, and this is where the study of cohesion bcomes important. For this reason in both thesc chapters we concentrated on refcrcnce and substitution as relations betwcen sentences, largcly ignoring intra-sentence presupposition.

We shall do the samc here. Ellipsis, or somcthing closely related to it, also occurs within scntences as in [4:2] abovc; and there arc ccrtain special structural possibilities, types of BRANcHING structurc,which do not occur when the presupposition is bctween sentences. In general we shall not be concerned with ellipsis within the sentencc, for the same reason as already given;it can be explained in terms of sentence structure and docs not constitute an independent agency of cohesion in the text. What we are interested in is cllipsis as a form of relation between sentences, where it is an aspect of the essential texture. The rclevance of cllipsis in the present context is its role in grammatical cohesion.

# 4.2Nominal cllipsis

# 4.2.1 Ellipsis within the noninal group

By NO MINAL ELLIpsis we mcan cllipsis within the nominal group.Thc structure of thc nominal group was outlined in 2.1. On thc logical dimension the structure is that of a Head with optional modification; thc modifying elements include some which prccede thc Head and some which follow it referred to here as Premodifier and Postmodificr respcctively. Thus in those two fast electric trains with pantographs thc Head is trains, the Premodificr is formed by those two fast electric and the Postmodifier by with pantographs.

The Modificr is combined with another structure, on thc cxperiential dimension which consists of the elements Dcictic (d), Numcrativc n, Epithet (e)Classifier (c)and Qualifier (q)rcprescnted here by those,two fast, electric and with pantographs respectively. The Deictic is normally a detcrminer, the Numerative a numcral or other quantifier,the Epithet an adjectivc and the Classificr a noun; but these correspondences are by no means exact.Thcrc may be Submodifiers at various places; these are usually adverbs like so,very and too.The Qualifier is normally a relative clause or prepositional phrase. The noun in this structure has the function referred to as the Thing.Most elements may occur more than once, and the tcndency for this to happen increases as one moves towards the later clcments of the structure.

The function of Head, which is always fillcd, is normally served by the common noun, propcr noun or pronoun cxprcssing the Thing.Personal pronouns are refcrencc items and were describcd in Chapter 2; they will not be discusscd further.Propcr nouns designate individuals, and are thercfore not capable of furthcr specification; thcy may sometimes be accompanied by descriptive modifiers, but these are not subject to ellipsis. Common nouns, on the other hand, designate classes; thcy are often further specificd, and this is the function of the clements Dcictic, Numerative, Epithet and Classificr. Now under certain circumstances the common noun may be omitted and the function of Head takcn on by one of thesc other elements. This is what is mcant by nominal ellipsis.

In a non-elliptical nominal group, the Head is the Thing, the noun designating thc individual or class rcferred to.This may be a phenomenon of any kind:pcrson, animate or inanimate object,abstraction, institution, process qualitystate or relation.In an clliptical nominal groupthis clement is not expressed, and one of the other elements (Deictic, Numerative, Epithct or Classifier functions as Head. This is very frequcntly a Dcictic or Numerative, much less frequently an Epithct. It is very rarely a Classifier; since the Classificr is usually a noun,if it functioned as Head it would be liable itself to be interpreted as the Thing so,for cxamplc, we cannot replace a tall brick chimney by a tallbrick see 4.2.3 bclow).

In gencral, with exceptions to bc noted below (4.2.3 and 4.2.3.5), any nominal group having thc function of Head filled by a word that normally functions within the Modificr is an clliptical one.

Nominal ellipsis therefore involves the upgrading of a word functioning as Deictic, Numcrative, Epithet or Classifier from the status of Modificr to the status of Head.For example,

[4:6] Four other Oysters followed them, and yet another four.

In the second linc four, which is a Nunerative and thcrcfore normally acts as Modificr, is upgraded to function as Head. Similarly in

[4:7] Which last longer, the curved rods or the straight rods?- The straight are less likely to break.

straight is an Epithet,functioning as Modifier in thc question but as Head in the rcsponse. Both another four and the straight arc elliptical noninal groups.

An elliptical nominal group clearly requires that thcre should be available from some source or other thc information neccssary for filling it out. Faced with another four,we necd to know'another four what?'Normally, the source of information is a prcceding nominal group.A nominal group that is elliptical presupposes a previous onc that is not, and it is therefore cohesive.

If wc want to fill out an clliptical nominal group, for tcxt analysis purposcs, there are two ways of doing so. One way is simply to push down'the element functioning as Head, making it a Modificr, and add themissingHead in its place.The question whether any other missing elements would have to be supplicd is discussed in 4.2.3 below.) By this process another four in [4:6] would becomc another four oysters. The other way of doing it is to kcep the clliptical group as it is and add a partitive Qualificr this would give another four of the oysters.Thc partitive is possible only under certain conditions: gencrally, whcn thc elliptical group designates some aggrcgate - a subset, fraction, quantity or collective that is different from that designated by the presupposed group.Hence in [4:7] the partitive form is not possible.The hcad noun in the partitive expression will bc singular or non-singular plural or mass according to thc typc of aggrcgatc:singular if thc clliptical group is partitive in the narrower sense ie designating a fraction) and non-singular otherwisc. The former typc arc less readily elliptical (but sec 4.2.3.4 below on indcfinite quantificrs):

[4:8] a. How did you enjoy thc cxhibition-A lotof thc cxhibition was very good, though not all. b.How did you enjoy thc paintings?-A lot of thc paintings) were vcry good, though not all.

So an clliptical noninal group may always bc replaced by its full, non clliptical cquivalent, either in simple form or in expanded, partitivc form. In cither case the presupposed items arc restored.The two possibilitics arisc bccause the partitive type is in any case a regular form of thc English nominal group,obligatory in some instances, such as whcrc thcrc is quantification within the deixis as in [4:9a], and optional in certain others such as [4:9b]:

[4:9] a. Two of my rosebushcs wcre uprooted. b.That was his most popular film/the most popular of his films.

The partitive Qualificr may itself contain an elliptical nominal group, as in one of the three,any of Fred's.We may now modify the earlier statement that a nominal group having Deictic,Numerative,Epithet or Classifier as Head is always clliptical. If it contains a partitive Qualifierit is not elliptical - unless thc partitive Qualifier is itself elliptical.

Some further examples:

a.the best. b.the best hat. [4:1o Which hat will you wear?This isc. the best of the hats. d. the best of the three. e. the best you have

In all cases the is Deictic three is Numerativebest is Epithet and hat is the common noun representing the Thing.Then:

a is clliptical the is Modificr, best is Head.   
b is non-ellipticalthe best is Modifierlat is Hcad.   
$\langle c \rangle$ is non-elliptical;the is Modifierbest is Hcad,of the hats is partitivc Qualifier,non-clliptical.   
(d) is elliptical;structure as c)except that thc partitive Qualifier of the three is itself clliptical.   
(e is ellipticalstructure as c)except that the Qualificr you have is not partitive.

# 4.2.2 Presupposition of noninal elements

An clliptical nominal group is cohesive; it points anaphorically to anothcr nominal group which is presupposed by it.But how much of the prcsupposed group is in fact included within the presupposition?

So far we havc mercly indicatcd that the Thing designated by the common noun is prcsupposcd.But thcrc may bc othcr clements in the presupposed group which likewise do not occur in thc elliptical one for example

[4:11 Herc are my two white silk scarves.I can lend you one if you like.

Here one presumably presupposes not only scarves but also thc garnishings white and silkit could bc filled out as one white silk scarf,or one of my white silk scarves.This makes it possiblc to state what cAn be presupposcd,by reference to the structure of thc nominal group in terms of the elements Deictic,Numerative,Epithet and Classificrnotc that these elements occur in the order stated,followed by the Thing. In cllipsis the Thing is always presupposed.(Wc have already pointcd out that in cllipsis the Thing is always a common noun, since proper nouns and pronouns do not take defining Modifiers.) In addition, any element following the one that is upgraded in the elliptical nominal group may be presupposcd.Thus

<html><body><table><tr><td>If Head is filled by</td><td>This must bc presupposed:</td><td>These may be presupposed:</td></tr><tr><td>Deictic</td><td>Thing</td><td>Numerative,Epithet, Classifier</td></tr><tr><td>Numerative</td><td>Thing</td><td>Epithet,Classificr</td></tr><tr><td>Epithet</td><td>Thing</td><td>Classificr</td></tr><tr><td>Classifier</td><td>Thing</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

As already noted above, it is rare for the Classifier to occur as Head. These patterns arc excmplified in [4:12].In [4:12a]yours Dcicticis Head, and the presupposcd clements include not only scarves Thing but also silk Classifier)white Epithet and possibly two Numcrative:

a.Where are yours? [4:12]Here are my two b.I used to havc three white silk scarves. c.Can you sec any black? d.Or would you prcfer the cotton?

[4:12b] is like [4:11];three prcsupposes scarf, silk and white. In c the clliptical group is any black;this presupposcs scarf and silk, but thcre may bc any number and they may not be minc. Finally, in d) only scarf is presupposed.

In gencral, thcn, thc range of possible presuppositions is dependent on the structurc of the nominal group.It extends only over that part of the presupposed group which could follow the element acting as Head in thc elliptical group.Those parts which would precede or bc concurrcnt with it are excludcd from the prcsupposition; and this restriction apparently applies even to subcategorics within the Deictic and Numerative sec 4.2.4.1-4 below)for cxample:

[4:13 a. They haven't got my usual morning paper.Can I borrow yours? b.The first three buds all fell off. We'll have to watch the next.

where yours excludes usual even though your usual could occur bccause both your and usual are Deictic elements, and next excludes three cvcn though next three could occur because both are Numerative elements.But there is considcrable indcterminacy at this point.

What can be presupposed, therefore, is anything having a function in the series ${ \mathrm { d } } - { \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } } - { \boldsymbol { \mathrm { e } } } - { \boldsymbol { \mathrm { c } } }$ that is LATer than that occupied by the Head of the elliptical group.Whatever has the same or a preceding function is rcpudiated.To exemplify once more, if thc presupposed group is those two tall brick chinneys, the following table shows what is repudiated and what is not repudiated (and therefore may be takcn over by prcsupposition) by the various elliptical groups;note that x stands for thc function of Thing:

<html><body><table><tr><td>If elliptical group is:</td><td>Thesc arc repudiated:</td><td>These are not repudiated:</td></tr><tr><td>which? (d)</td><td>d</td><td>nccx=two tallbrick chimneys</td></tr><tr><td>thrce (n)</td><td>dn</td><td>ecx=tall brick chimneys</td></tr><tr><td>two not so tall ne</td><td>dne</td><td>cx=brick chimneys</td></tr><tr><td>some stone (dc)</td><td>dnec</td><td>x=chimncys</td></tr></table></body></html>

The further to the right' the final element of the presupposing group, the more usual it is to presuppose by substitution rather than by cllipsis. Wc would expect some stone ones rathcr than some stone (stone $=$ Classifier); and perhaps also two not so tall ones tall $=$ Epithet).

However,it is not ncccssarily the case that cverything that could bc presupposed actually is presupposed. We can take it as a gencral guiding principle that it will be, but this will certainly nced to bc modificd to somc extent.Consider an examplc such as

[4:14] Don't you like those thrce little white cightcenth-century stonc cottagcs?-I prefer minc.

My three little whitc eighteenth-century stonc cottages ? Or just my cottage? The answer is possiblc cven if mine'is one large red Elizabcthan brick and timbered one. We would accept any interpretation that madc sense and was consistent with what we alrcady knew.It is worth noting, at the samc time, that a form such as nine in this context is in the strict sense of the terin ambiguous: it could stand as the realization of a number of diffcrent selections.

We do find a rough scalc of probabilitycxtending from right to left in thc nominal group.Of thc elements that MAy be presupposcd in any given instancc,namely those that follow the element that is explicitly repudiated in thc clliptical group, we have seen that the Thing that which is designated by thc Head in a non-elliptical structure, always is presupposed.Going from right to left thc Classifier, if prcsent, is very likcly to bc: thc Epithet somewhat less likely, and the Numerative less likely still. Thc Deictic, being the first element, normally cannot be presupposed, by the principle illustrated in [4: 12] and $\left[ 4 : \mathbb { I } \left. 3 \right] \right.$ above. And therc is an overriding principle that the presupposed items must be continuous: it would not be possible for mine in $\left[ 4 : \mathbb { I } 4 \right]$ to presupposc three little white but not eighteenthcentury stone.

It is slightly odd, therefore, to find all the clcments in a long nominal group, including the Classifier, repudiated in an instance where structurally they could be presupposed. $\left[ 4 : \operatorname { I } 5 \right]$ is only doubtfully acceptable:

[4:15] I think I'll get one of those gorgeous big red china dogs. Mine barks too much.

In spoken English, thcre is often a phonological indication of the extent of prcsupposition. It is characteristic of an elliptical nominal group that its Head carries tonic prominence in thc tone group.This is natural, since tonic prominence is the realization of new or contrastive information, and an elliptical nominal group (like one with substitution) is inherently new, in the sensc that it differs in some respect from the one it prcsupposes;not necessarily having a different referent (it could refer contrastively to the samc thing), but thc function of an elliptical item is to start afresh, taking the prcsupposed itcm as a reference point. Thus the occurrence of an clliptical nominal such as nine allows us to predict that somewhere in the cnvironmcnt is an item cxpressing a Thingsuch as hat,which either was not'minc'or,ifit was, demanded somc cxplicit reaffirmation of the fact, as it would for cxamplc in answer to thc qucstion Whose is this hat?-Its nine. In this scnse an elliptical group always cmbodics some new informaion.

Now it often happens that thc prcsupposcd nominal group signals a articular point of repudiation - an clement with which thc prcsupposing lliptical group is specifically in contrast-by the device of tonic promincncc.For cxample if your hat is to be followed by ine the ronic will fall on your. This is especially likely to happen in a question-answer scqucnce, or if the two nominal groups arc part of an utterance by the samc spcakcr, who may have planned the information structure as a whole:That's not YOUR hat. It's MINe.A MARkeD tonic (tonic prominencc falling on some element other than the last) signals contrastive information; eg

[4:16] The two white silk scarves were bcautifully made.

Hcre thc word white is tonic, and this gives an expectation that if an elliptical or substitute nominal group follows it will be one that repudiates white, such as why did you buy the pink (one?

# 4.2.3 Types of nominal ellipsis

We now consider in more detail some examplcs of the most frcqucntly occurring types of nominal ellipsis, with comments on the words or word classes that function as Head in the elliptical group.

We have already noted that the Classifier is vcry rarely left to function as Head. In $\left[ 4 : \operatorname { I } 7 \mathrm { } \mathrm { } \mathrm { } \mathrm { } \mathrm { } \mathrm { } - \mathrm { } \mathrm { } \mathrm { } \mathrm { } \mathrm { } \right]$ we have four examples in which the presupposing group contains a Classifier; thcy are given in a substitute form,with one(s) as Head, and only in the last of thc four would it bc possible to delete the substitute leaving an elliptical group ending in a Classifier:

$\left[ 4 : 1 7 \right]$ a.Don't you likc babics?-Ycs but I can't stand crying oncs. b.I've never tricd Mrs Sugden's cherry cakc, but I like her ginger one. c.Borrow my copy. The library one is out on loan. d.Did you win a first prize?-No, I only got a third onc.

The principle behind this restriction is very clcar.The Classifier is typically, though not always, realized by a word that could also realize thc

Thing usually a noun, as in (b and (c)or the $- i n \xi$ form of a verb as in a). Hence a nominal group having such an itcm as its Head would normally bc interpreted as non-clliptical (so I cant stand crying would be intcrpreted not as crying ones ie crying babicsbut simply as thc phenomcnon of anyone crying).There arc some instances whcrc a Classifier cAn function as Head, usually those wherc the elliptical intcrpretation of the resulting nominal group is in somc way the most natural one: for cxanple if the Classificr is not a noun, as in $\left[ 4 : \tau 7 \mathrm { d } \right]$ or if the presupposing status of thc nominal group is signallcd by an anaphoric the as in [4:12d] above. These, however, arc a minority.

But,as suggested in thc prcvious scction,wc really have a gradation or clinc'hcrc,rather than a sharp distinction bctween the classificr and the rest.The structural formula Deictic - Nuncrative - Epithct -Classifier represents a gradual move, in the process of specifying the class of things that is expressed by the Head,from onc type of spccification to another: beginning, in the Deictic, with a kind of specification that is tcmporary, and related to the actual spccch situation, and moving on to one that is increasingly permanent and inherent. Specification of the first kind is achieved by itcms in closed systens, such as this/that, or thc pronominal possessives; that of the second kind by lexical items, which form open classes. Hence as one moves along this scale, the actual words used arc more and more noun-like; thcy are words which thcmselves have thc potential of expressing a class of things'such as is typically expressed by a noun functioning as Head, and so thcy are liable to bc interprcted as Head. This being the case, such words arc Less likely to function as Head when thcy are exprcssing somcthing else. This docs not mean that a nominal group having an Epithct or Classifier in it cAnnor be anaphoric and cohesive; but it will tend to achieve this status by substitution rather than by ellipsis.

The most characteristic instances of ellipsis, thereforc, are thosc with Deictic or Numerative as Head. Hcre thc situation is the other way round: substitution is much less common, and in some cases excluded altogether. So we have for example

Ellipsis Substitution   
Deictic: these, my, these ones my ones, any any ones rather than   
Numerative: the first, the first ones two ones, two,more more ones

In principlc any Dcictic or Numerative elcment can function as Hcad in nominal ellipsis, with somc minor exceptions which will be noted.

For the remainder of $4 . 2$ therefore,we shall be concerned mainly with deictic and numerative clcments, with a relatively short scction on epithet ellipsis at the end.Deictics arc considcred first.

# 4.2.3.1 SPECIFIC DEICTICS

Following on from thc earlier account of deixis in the nominal group, we rccognize a division of the Deictic element into two parts, one forming thc Dcictic properly so callcd and one which has bccn rcferred to as posTDeicric.The words functioning as Deictic are mostly of the class of determiner; with the demonstrative, possessive and indefinite determiners forming a network of systemically rclated categories-one that includes the articles, which are thus shown to bc part of a wider systcm.Those functioning as Post-deictic are adjectives.In

[4:18] Hcre the other guinea-pig checrcd, and was suppressed.

the is Deictic and othier is Post-deictic.Post-dcictics are discussed in 4.2.3-3 below.

Within the Dcictic proper, the major distinction, and that which is most rclcvant to ellipsis,is into specific deictics possessives, demonstratives and the and non-specificcach,everyall bothanyeither,noneithersomeand a).Non-specific and specific deictics may be combincd only through thc use of a partitive qualifier,eg:each of my children,any of the answers,sone of that pudding.The exceptions arc all and bothwhich can be joined directly to another determiner,in what is somctimes therefore rcfcrred to as PRE-DEicTIc position, as in all our yesterdays, both these gates.

Thc words all and both very frequently function elliptically.Thcy may refer back to a single nominal group;if so it will bc plural, having the sense of 'two'if presupposed by both and morc than two if presupposed by all. There is no equivalent singular form; and curiously all is Nor used elliptically to refer to a mass noun,cvcn though in non-elliptical nominal groups it is rcgularly mass, as in all the milk was sour.

For cxamplc:

[4:19] a. Thc men got back at nidnight.Both were tired out. b.Thc men got back at midnight.All were tired out. c.The milk couldn't bc used.All was sour.

Of thcse,c) is inpossiblcthere is in fact no elliptical form here,just as there is no form of substitution with mass nouns.At thc same time, however, thc item presupposcd by all or both may consist of separatc nominal groups; so we would have to say rather that these words prcsuppose a certain numbcr of entities, which may have becn expressed either in thc form of one plural noun or as diffrent nouns, singular or plural. Furthermore these entities' are themselves sets of any extent.

We can summarize this by saying that both refers to two sets and all to three or more sets. These sets may bc combined in one nominal group, as in [4:19a and b] above, and in [4:20a] whcre thc presupposcd item is the parents ie (i the fathcr and (ii the mother.Or each onc may bc a separatc nonninal group, not always in thc samc sentence but usually with some indication that they bclong togethcr, such as parallelism of structure; an examplc is [4:2ob] whcre hoth presupposces i the parents and (ii the children. And in this case any one set may itself bc complex and consist of a further coordinationas in [4:2oc]which hasi parents and other responsible adults and (ii) children.

[4:20] a.The parents could not be traced. Apparently both were abroad. b. Thc parents may enjoy it, but the children will bc bored.You cannot please both. c. If parents and other responsible adults make no concessions children will rcbel. And both will be ccrtain they are right.

In the last typc, thcre must be explicit linkage betwecn the items that are being treated as a single setparents and other responsible adults).We cannot havc both presupposing (i the boy's parents and his teachers and (ii the boy, in [4:21],becausc there is nothing to show that the boy's parents and his teachers belong together:

[4:21] Thc boy's parents had no timc for him.At school, his teachers could make little contact.Yet the boy had a lot of ability,if hc'd tried. I suppose both were at fault, rcally.

Sometincs it is not clear which items are bcing grouped together. and ambiguity results, as in

[4: 22] The father and the mothcr were so busy making moncy that the two children werc left to their own devices.Naturally both were resentful.

In addition to all and both, othcr Deictic clements regularly function as Head of an elliptical nominal group.The specific deictics are (i) demonstratives and theand i possessives.The demonstrativesthis thatthesethose and which?) all occur elliptically, with very grcat frequency. Since thcy are themsclvcs referencc items (scc 2.4 and 2.4.1 thcy are often anaphoric anywaybut wherever the nominal group could bc filled out with a noun Hcad, or by the substitute $o n e ( s )$ , a dcmonstrative functioning as Head is in fact an cxanple of ellipsis.One cxamplc will sufficethose is elliptical for those pills:

[4:23] Takc thesc pills thrce tines daily.And you'd better have some more of those too.

The word the does not operate elliptically; since its function is to signal that the 'thingdesignated is fully defined,but by somcthing other than the itself, it normally requires another item with it as in the two the small (one)the one that got away. Where it could have occurred clliptically it is replaced by its non-reduced cognate form that.

Possessives include both nominals (Snith's, my father's, etc and pronominals (nyyour,ctc).The latter havc a special form when functioning as Hcad: mine ours, yours, hisherstheirswhose,andrarely) its.Whenever a posscssive occurs as Hcad it is clliptical, and in thc casc of thc third person pronominals this mcans, as noted in Chaptcr 2 above (see 2.3.4, [2:24]), that therc is a doublc cohesive tie. An item such as hers presupposes both a pcrson as possessor and a thing posscssed,the former by reference her)thc latter by cllipsis the posscssive

[4:24] Just ask Janct how to polish thc brassware.Hers sparkles.

# 4.2.3.2 NON-SPECIFIC DEICTICS

The non-specific Deictics are each every any, either, no neither, a and some. as well as all and bot/ which have already been discussed. Of these, all occur as Head of an elliptical nominal except every, but a and no have to bc rcpresented by the forms one and none respcctively.Some cxamplcs:

[4:2s a.I hope no bones are broken-Nonc to spcak of. b.I won't be introduced to the pudding,plcase.May I givc you some? c.Have some wine.-I dont see any winc.-There isn't any. d.Write an essay on the Stuart kings.Two pages about cach will do. e.His sons went into business.Neither succeeded.

Of thcse, either and neither are like both in presupposing two scts; and each presupposes two or more.Again these may bc cxpressed cither as onc plural nominal group or separately; and if they are scparatc, any onc set may itself bc a coordination as in ${ \big [ } 4 : 2 6 a { \big ] }$ and b]. Hencc ambiguity may arise in thc samc way as with all and bothfor cxample if [426b had three bedrooms, the each might presuppose just these.

[4:26] a. Smith and Jones arc on holiday.I wonder if cither has left an address. b.The fat has a sitting-rooma dining-room and onc bcdroom. Each has a window overlooking thc park.

Thc non-dual equivalents of either and neither are any and no; thcy are like all, except that they can occur elliptically with singular and mass nouns, as in $ { \left\lfloor { 4 : 2 5 \mathrm { a } } \right. }$ and c].Thc two pairs are proportional:no is to any as neither is to either.No and neither are of course negative, but are usually restrictcd to clauses of declarativc mood where the verb is positivc;while any and either occur in clauses which are interrogative or hypothetical, OR wherc the verb is negative, or is positive and the sense is it doesnt matter which'In the latter type any, when uscd clliptically, repudiates any cardinal numeral in the presupposed group and is usually singular $\equiv ^ { \ast }$ any one') unlcss some numeral occurs with it,such as any three.Hence

[4:27]Here are thirteen cards. Take any.Now give me any three.

In its interrogativc, hypothetical or negative use has he any?if he has any; he hasn't any)the difference betwecn singular and plural is neutralized. In non-clliptical groups, thc plural form is usually used (has he any friends?) as it tends to be also with no he has no friends)but when any is Head of an elliptical group this may be fillcd out with either a singular or a plural noun Hcad irrespective of the number of the presupposed group, and likcwise if any is Subject it nay occur with either singular or plural verbs:

[4:28 a.I want a map of the Lake District. Have you got any? I want somc maps of the Lake District. b. I'm expecting a lettcr. Has any come I'm expecting some letters.Have any come?

In the same way the singular/plural distinction is neutralized with the negative no.Its elliptical form $n o n e \left( = \hbar 0 + o \hbar \mathcal { E } \right)$ shows that it was originally treated as singular, but usage is no longer consistent:

[4:29] I've checked all the files.None werc/was missing.

The elliptical some was mentioned in Chapter 33.2.3.3[3:25]and

Table 5).This is thc non-singular mass or plural form of the indefinite article, and whcn functioning elliptically as Head,it is always in its nonreduced formie [sam] not [sm].Thc nominal group presupposed by it may bc singular or plural, and any numeral is rcpudiated:

[4:30] a. These apples are delicious. Let's buy some. b.I had a dozen tennis balls;where are thcy?-I've got some, you can borrow mine.

In b)some does not mcan some of thc dozcn f I haven't got any.

Parallel to sone in its non-rcduccd form is one, which is the non-rcduced form of thc singular indefinitc articlc a.It is this fron which is dcrived thc nominal substitute one discussed in Chapter 33.2 and 3.2.1.As pointcd out there 3.33.3[3:15ci])it is difficult to distinguish clliptical one from one of the uscs of thc substitute one; but the difference appears in the plural, sincc the plural of the substitute one is ones whereas thc plural of the determincr indefinite article one is some. In [4:31] thc one is an clliptical indcfinite article $( c f [ 3 : 2 7 ] )$ ..

[4:31] But you make no remark-I didn't know I had to make one, just then.

The elliptical usc of dcictic elements is a major source of cohesion in English texts.The Deictic is the element in the nominal group that relates to the HErE AND Now, linking thc thing referred to to its verbal and situational context.It is natural, thcrcforc, that it should bc typically used as a mcans of harking back to a thing that has already bccn mentioned, while at the same time recontcxtualizing it by anaphoric or cxophoric reference.

# 4.2.3.3POST-DEICTICS

The words functioning as Post-dcictic element in thc nominal group are not determiners but adjectives.There are some thirty or forty adjcctives used commonly in Dcictic function, and a number of others used occasionally in this way;the frcqucnt ones include othersane different identical, usual,regularcertainoddfanous, well-known typicalobvious.They combine with the, a or other dctcrmincr (thc combination $^ { a + }$ other bcing written and pronounced as onc word another;and thcy may bc FollowED By a Numerative, unlike adjcctives in thcir normal function as Epithet which must roLlow any numerative clement. The distinction of meaning betwecn Deictic and Epithet and f2.5.1 [2:8o] above can be scen in

Deictic

the identical three questions the usual two conments a different three people the odd few ideas the obvious first placc to stop

Epithet   
threc identical questions   
two usual comments   
threc diffcrent pcople   
a few odd idcas   
the first obvious place to stop

Of the adjectives used in deictic function thc oncs which regularly occur clliptically are sane and other.The elliptical usc of the sane was treated as substitution(3.2.5) since it has been extended to very gcneral use including clause substitution, as in do the same; actually an example such as [3:51] above (I'll have the same) is simply an elliptical nominal group with same as Head. Thc Post-dcictic other conbines cither with spccific Deictic (the otherthat other,etc or with non-specificany other anotheretc)and when it is used as Head it has a special plural form others. The nominal group which it presupposcs need not be of the same number, and any numeral in it is repudiated, as with any.

Example:

[4:32] I've used up thesc thrcc ycllow folders you gave me.Can I use the other?

which does not mean the other thrce With a specific Deictic, othe $( s )$ refers to the last remaining member(s) of a set, and therefore it prcsupposes that all others must have been specified.This explains the frcqucncy with which it is preceded by another nominal group, often also anaphoric (eg: one some of then the firstetc which is both presupposed and prcsupposingpresupposed by other but itself also rclating back to the ultimately presupposed item.For example

[4:33] A group of wcll-dressed young mcn suddenly appeared on the stagc.One of them bowed to the audicncc; the others stood motionless.

The original item must be semantically plural-it must refcr to more than one set, as described in $4 \cdot 2 . 3 \cdot 1$ above; and the elliptical other(s) presupposes just as much of it as does the intermediate item.Here onc of them and the others both presuppose well-dressed young men.

The elliptical use of other illustrates very well the indetcrninacy which may arisc in the extent of presupposition.If we had just thc cxample

[4:34] I see you've sold those two large red china dogs. Have you any others?

in the abscncc of further evidence we could not tell whether to fill this out as china dogs, red china dogs or large red china dogs.Similarly in [4:32]:the other yellow ones or just the other one? As we pointed out carlier, the cxtent of the prcsupposition may be signalled in the spoken language by thc location of thc tonic nucleus.So if in [4:34] the tonic falls on red, others mcans of another colourif on large, it means any small ones,and so on.

Finally wc may note that elliptical nominal groups with Dcictic as Hcad may also be exophoric,either in the generalized sense or spccifically to thc context of situation:

[4:35]a.Some say one thing, others say another. b.All is lost. c.All go into the other room. d.Have you been to Mary's recently? e. I'll have the usual, please.

# 4.2.3.4 NUMERATIVES

Of the elements occurring after the Dcictic in thc nominal group, only the Numerative and certain types of Epithct funcuon at all regularly as the Head in ellipsis.

The Numerative elcment in the nominal group is expressed by numerals or other quantifying words, which form three subcatcgorics: ordinals, cardinals, and indefinite quantifiers.Thc ordinals arc firstnext, last second, thirdfourth etc;they are often used clliptically gencrally with the or a possessive as Deictic:

[4:36] Havc another chocolate.-No thanks;that was my third

Like the supcrlative form of an adjective,which in many ways it resembles ordinals arc in a scnse'superlative numerals'),an ordinal is itself likely to bc presupposing cven if thc nominal group in which it occurs is not elliptical; thus the second question prcsupposes that there was a first question, and the first question that thcrc is likely to bc a next.Again like superlatives, ordinals are often cataphoric to a Qualificr which indicates the domain of thc ordering,supplying thc informationfirst, ctc,in what respcct? for cxample,to leave in

[4:37 Smith was the first person to leavc.I was the sccond.

Cardinal numerals arc also frequent in cllipsis, and may bc preccded by any Dcictic that is appropriate in numbcr,eg:the three these three,any three, all three and also by post-deictic adjcctives as in the usual three, the same three.

[4:38] a. Havc anothcr chocolate.-No thanks; I've had my three. b.Thc other mcssenger's callcd Hatta.I must have two,you know.One to comc, and one to go.

With both ordinals and cardinals the presupposed noun may be either singular or plural,but it cannot bc a nass noun unless there is also somc measurc word present or prcsupposcd-naturally,sincemass'=uncountable'.For cxample if in [4:36] and [4:38a] we had Have some more teathc answer would still be possiblc in each casc,but only because it could be intcrpreted as presupposing cup(s).

The indcfinitc quantifiers are itcms such as muchmanymoremostfew, several,a littlelots a bithundredsctc;they includc numerous transient and more or less slang exprcssions especially used by children.Like other items with a numerative function,they are very frcquently used in ellipsis;being indefinite,they are usually not accompanicd by a Dcictic, except where a is demandcd as in a lot, although the comparative forms nore, fewer and less may be preceded by no or any. Some of them are specific to either count or mass nouns.

Examples:

[4:39] a.Can all cats climb trees?-They all can; and most do. b.'You ought to have a wooden horsc on wheels, that you ought!-I'll gct one'thc Knight said thoughtfully to himself.One or two-several.'

Many of the indcfinite quantifiers derive from measurc nouns; for example lot, amount and the largcr numbers such as hundred and thousand. Since these still require partitive Qualifiers a lot of...),they arc not very clearly distinguished from thc general class of mcasure noun, which includes quantitativeseg:halfpiecedozen)partitives (eg:partsideendand collcctives (eg groupsetpack.For thc purposes of cohesionthese also-can bc rcgarded as requiring to bc fillcd out'by a partitive Qualificr, and thereforc as elliptical if functioning as Head. Hence Alice's predicament in [4:40] One sidc will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.One side of what? The cthcr side of what?'thought Alice to herself.'Of the mushroom'said the Catcrpillar, just as if shc had asked it aloud.

Some combinations of quantificrs are possible,namely ordinal numeral plus cardinal or in a few cases, ordinal numcral plus indefiniteusually in the order stated.The combination of cardinal plus indefinite occurs only if thc indefinitc is comparativc, as in three more. Such combinations are regularly elliptical,eg:the last three, the next few.

Whereas the specific Deictics - the demonstratives and possessivestend to occur alone, being themsclves reference items, the Numeratives, like the non-specific Deictics, tend to be filled out precisely by a rcfcrence itcm in thc form of a partitive Qualifier with third person pronoun.So we oftcn find any of them the first of them three of then and so on.These are of coursc still cohesive,but the prcsupposition is of thc rcfcrcnce type rather than ellipsis.

Like thc Deictics, Nuncratives in elliptical use may be cxophoric; eg in 4:37 wc might have had Suith was the first to leavewith person understood.The prcsupposed item will be assumed to be some general catcgory of which the itcm referred to, here Snithis a member.This can be demonstrated by

[4:41] Her money will be the first to leave her. Her husband will be the next.

which puts her money and her hsband into thc samc gcncral category by presupposition.Note the special cxophoric use of a possessivc Deictic plus cardinal numeral to mean'children'as in the proud mothcr's remark

[4:42My thrce are absolutc terrors.

Indefinitc quantifiers occur cxophorically in expressions like [4:43] He cxpccts a lot.But you can't do much to hclp him.

# 4.2.3.5EPITHETS

The function of Epithet is typically fulfilled by an adjective.It is not common to find adjectives occurring as Head in cllipsis-colour adjectives are pcrhaps the most usual - cxcept in their comparative and, cspecially, superlative forms.This reflects thc fact that superlativc and comparativc adjectives are really functioning in a way that is morc likc a Numerative; possibly instead of the function Numerative in thc nominal group we should recognize a moie general function Ordinative, which would includc superlative and perhaps also comparative adjectives, as well as thc classes of word that function as Numeratives proper (numerals and indefinite quantifiers).

The superlative adjcctive prcccdcs other Epithcts and, like ordinal nunerals cf 4.2.3.4 above,is usually accompanicd by the or a possessive Deictic. Note in this connection the difference between a and b) in [4:44]

[4:44] a. Apples are thc cheapest in autumn. b.Apples are cheapest in autumn.

In a wc may fairly ask 'the cheapest what?the cheapest is an clliptical group presupposing somc item such as fruit. Example b) is howevcr not elliptical; it is likc apples are cheap, and thc domain of thc superlative is provided by thc time element within thc clause, ie cheapcr in antumn than at other times.

Even where thc superlative is elliptical, the presupposed group may stil be within the clause. This happens only in equative clauses of the identifying type (those which are rcvcrsiblc,eg: apples are thc cheapest the cheapest are apples), which are probably thc most frequent cnvironment for clliptical supcrlatives.So in [4:45a and b] we get two quitc different notions of the qualities of the clown:

[4:45] a. That clown is the finest I'vc cver seen. b.Thcy are fine actors.That clown is the finest I've ever seen.

In [4:45a] wc assumc that the presupposed item is clown so although the finest is clliptical the presupposition is within thc clause. In [4:45b],on thc Other hand, the finest presupposes actor from the preceding sentencc.

More accurately, [4:4sb] is ambiguous; it may mean thc fincst actor or just the finest clown' Like an ordinal, a superlative presupposes some item that is semantically plural more than one set,which as usual may be expressed in onc nominal group or by a coordination); with thc diffcrcnce that in thc casc of the superlative, this may also take thc form of a mass noun, with thc intcrpretation the...-cst kind ofas in

[4:46]'I told you butter wouldn't suit the works.-It was thc best butter.

As long as the clause is equative and the Subject is a common noun. an elliptical superlative as Complement will always bc ambiguous in this way. Otherwise,there is no ambiguity.Ifit is not cquative the superlative must refer to a preceding clause, as in [4:47a];and likewisc if thc Subjcct is a proper noun, as in [4:47b] which cannot be interpreted as 'thc finest Smith':

[4:47] a.They are fine actors.Jones always gets hold of the finest. b. They are fine actors.Smith is thc fincst I've ever seen.

As would be expected, a supcrlative repudiatcs all Numcratives, including cardinals, in the presupposcd group. It may itself be singular or plural, and if plural may be preccded by its own cardinal as in the three youngest.

Comparatives arc rather different from superlatives. Comparative adjectives are inherently presupposing by reference; this has bcen discussed above in 2.5.Thcre must be a standard of comparison:anything that is bigger is bigger than'something clse (which may bc than itself under othcr circumstances). There are two specificed sets involved, whereas with the superlative therc is only one. This presupposition is not, however, an instance of ellipsis.

One use of the comparative roRm of the adjective, always with dcictic the, is actually scmantically supcrlativc: this is that in which the sensc is the...-cst of twoAn equative clausc having this type of comparative in complcmcnt position, such as Snith is the beticr actoris of the DenIryING type; and if the comparative functions as Head, as it docs in $\left[ 4 : 4 8 \mathrm { a } \right]$ then it is clliptical, just as a superlative would bc (cf [4:44al).Thc true comparative, however, docs not take the, and an cquative clause such as [4:48b] is not identifying but attributive.

[4:48] a. Mary is thc clcvcrer. b.Mary is clevercr.

[4:48b] is not an clliptical clausc.It prcsupposes by rcfcrence, but not by ellipsis; it cannot befilled out'by a noun Head or a noun substitute.The structure,in factis that of [4:44b].In other words the three clauses apples are cheap apples are cheaper than pcars) and apples are cheapest in autumn) are all attributive clauses, and thc nominal groups which function as Attributc, those consisting just of an adjective (cheap cheaper, cheapest)arc not elliptical forms.This function -that of Attribute in the clausc-is thc only onc in which an Epithet occurring as Head is not elliptical.

A nominal group with a truc comparative as Head is, however, clliptical under all other conditions; for examplc

[4:49] I'll buy you somc prcttier.

Thesc arc less common than elliptical supcrlatives,but more conimon than elliptical uses of the adjective in a non-comparcd form see below).The presupposed nominal group may bc count singular, count plural or mass.

There is onc usc of the true comparativc which is confusing becausc it is preceded by the and looks like a superlative.This is as in

[4:50] The smaller the dog,the louder thc bark.

Here the is not a Deictic but a Subnodifier with the sensc of by how muchby that much'-originally not the definite article but the instrumental case of that. Therc may bc ambiguity between this type and [4:48a],as in

[4:51] Mrs Jones always uses Bliss.Her clothcs are thc whitcr.

-the whiter for it, or the whiter of thc two

We have cxemplificd superlatives and comparatives only in thc inflected forms -est and -er, but they may also of course be cxpressed by more. and most....Everything that has been said applies to those forms also. Noticc that they diffcr from more and most as indcfinitc quantifiers (4.2.3.4); ambiguity may arisc bctween thc two,but only in thc full form of the nominal group, not whcn they arc clliptical.

Superlatives and, less often, comparatives may presuppose cxophorically,as in you take the biggestof the things in front of you).Examples of idiomatic uses arc the latest,in the special sense of'news'or'fashionand survival of the fittest.With comparatives we find mostly thc superlative type with the, in thc sense of thosc who are ...-cr than othcr people,eg the weaker.

Finally.other irens functioning as Epithet-that is, adjectivcs that arc neithcr superlative nor comparative- do not very often occur as Head in ellipsis, although colour words, which arc anomalous in various ways, form somcthing of an exception.Of the following, only [4:52a is elliptical in [4:52b] green is a noun

[4:52 a.The grecn suits you very well. b.Green suits you very wcll.

So in a) wc could havc the green one,with substitution instead of ellipsis.

In fact this is the more usual pattcrn;substitution tends to bc preferrcd to ellipsis whcrever the presupposing nominal group contains an Epithet or Classifier.Ellipsis occurs in an examplc such as

[4:53] I likc strong tea.I suppose weak is better for you.

But,as already noted, wherc the Epithct is functioning as an Attribute in thc clause, it always appears as Head of the nominal group;in apples are cheap,cheap is not clliptical.Items like the richthe long and the short of iton thc othcr hand, arc clliptical, but they are exophoric and so do not contributc to cohcsion. In its cohesive functionnominal ellipsis is largely confined to instances wherc thc presupposing element is a Deictic or Numcrative; in othcr words, wherc it is onc of thc closcd system elements in thc nominal group. Lexical elements usually require to bc accompanicd by thc substitute one(s).

# 4.3Verbal ellipsis

4.3.1 Ellipsis within the verbal group

By vERBAi EIhipsis wc mean cllipsis within the verbal group.Ior cxample in

4:54] a.Have you becn swimming-Yes,I have. b.What havc you been doing?- Swimming.

thc two verbal groups in the answers have in yes I lave in a and swiing in b)arc both instances of verbal ellipsis.Both can be said to stand forhave been suiming and there is no possibility of filling outwith any other items.So,for cxample,siing inb) could not bc interpreted as I will be swiming or they are swining.It could bc intcrprcted only as $I$ have been swning;and it could,furthcrmore, be REPLAcED By I have been siming, since as in all types of cllipsis, thc full form and thc clliptical one are both possible.

An elliptical verbal group presupposes one or more words from a previous verbal group.Technically,it is dcfincd as a verbal group whose structure does not fully express its systemic features-all thc choices that arc bcing made within the verbal group systems. Thc clliptical form swinning in $\left[ 4 : 5 4 \mathrm { b } \right]$ has the features posirive (as opposed to negative), FINIreas opposed to non-finite and A cTiveas opposcd to passive),as well as thosc Of a particular tense,PRESENT IN PAST IN PRESENI;but none of thesc sclections is shown in its own structure.Thcy have to bc recovered by prcsupposition.A verbal group whose structure fully rcpresents all its systemic features is not elliptical.

This dcfinition shows how verbal cllipsis differs from nominal ellipsis. In the vcrbal group,there is only onc lcxical clcment, and that is the verb itself:swin in $\left[ 4 : 5 4 \right]$ above.The wholc of the rest of the verbal group expresses systcmic sclcctions, choices of an either-or typc (though not always restrictcd to two possibilities which must be madc whenever a verbal group is uscd.The principal systems are:

1Finitencss:finitc or non-finite if finite: indicativc or imperative if indicative: modal or non-modal   
2 Polarity:positive or ncgative,and marked or unmarked   
3Voice:active or passive   
4 Tense:past or present or futurc recursively

Thesc sclections are obligatory for all verbal groups. Thcre is onc other system, that of'Contrast: contrastivc or non-contrastivewhich appears in spokcn English only,since it is cxpressed by intonation.It is sometimes given partial cxpression in thc written languagc by mcans of italics or other forms of typographical prominence eg:You woud do thatWc shall not deal separately with it as a verbal systcm; but some reference is made to cohesion by intonation in 5.9.

Taken all togcther,the words that go to makc up any non-elliptical verbal group,such as have been simningexpress all thc fcaturcs that have becn selected.In this instancc it is finitcindicativenon-modalpositiveactivc, and present in past in prcsentBut thcrc is no dircct correspondencc between the words and thc features. Wc cannot pick out one word cxpressing voicc, another for tense and so on.The selections are cxpressed as a whole by the words that arc used and by their arrangement in a particular structure.

Ellipsis in the nominal group was not described in this way,becausc thc nominal group is not made up,to anything like the samc cxtcnt,of grammatical systems. It contains many morc opcn choice (lexical) items. Actually there is no difference in principlc; thc samc thcoretical definition of ellipsis is valid for the nominal group also.But it would be much more complex to describe nominal ellipsis in terms of systems; so it was presented in structural terms instead.For the verbal group, on the other hand, it is thc systcm that provides the simplest way of cxplaining the facts of ellipsis, and so the systems listed above have bccn uscd as the basis for organizing the present scction.

Bcing able to give a thcorctical definition in thesc terms does not mean, however, that for cvery instance of a verbal group wc can always recognize whcthcr it is elliptical or not just by looking at it.This is because, as we havc alrcady pointed out, thc structure of the vcrbal group does not represent its meaning in a direct and obvious way. In the first place, although all verbal groups express tensc, voice, etc, we cannot identify each of thcsc with a particular word or other element in the structure of the verbal group.Considcr for cxample the verbal group has been seen. This is finitc, indicative, non-modal, positive passivc past in present.The features finite: indicative' arc cxpressed by the fact that the first word have is in thc finite form has; non-modal'by the abscnce of a modal element;positive'by thc absencc of a ncgative elementpassive'by the word be in next to last place plus the fact that the verb see is in thc passive participle form seenpast in..by thc word have plus thc fact that the ncxt word be is in thc past participle form been and ..in prcsentby the fact that the first word have is in the present tense form has.Thc whole thing is quite straightforward, although the details appear complex.

In the sccond placc, however, thc forms themsclvcs are often multivalcnt and cven thc whole verbal group may be ambiguous. Thus has is always finite and prcsentbut have may be Either finitc present or nonfinite, and so have been seen is ambiguous --it might bc a non-finite verbal group.The form saw (past finite) is distinct fron seen (past or passive participle);but in most verbs thesc arc the same, eg: heard made, and all regular weak verbs.And have,be, and do occur Bon as realizations of thc grammatical fcaturcs of tense, voicc,ctc, AnD as lexical verbs in their own rightin [4:ss]hasis and does arc grammatical in $\langle \Upsilon \rangle$ and lexical in 2)

[4:55]1 (2) a. John has caught a cold. a. John has a cold. b. Mary is looking pretty. b.Mary is pretty. c.Does John work well? c.John does his work well.

So although the verbal group in English is extremcly regular it is also fairly complex.It embodics a large numbcr of systemic choices,cspecially thosc of tense, and it expresses these in ways which are not readily accessiblec to any kind of automatic recognition procedure. In general, wc cannot say just by looking at a verbal group whether it is clliptical or not, as wc usually can with a nominal group; it is often necessary to consult the co-tcxt'in order to find out. For examplc, cach of the forns takinghas bcen and may have might be elliptical, or they might not. In $\left[ 4 : 5 6 \right]$ they arc non-elliptical in (1) but clliptical in (2) with non-elliptical cquivalents in square brackets):

[4:56]1 a.Taking photographs is a.What is he doing? Taking a wastc of time. photographs. [is taking] b.Janc was secretary once, b.Jane should havc been told,but but I don't think Mary I don't think she has been. [has cver has been. been told] c.Has hc a car?He may c.Has he seen it? He may have. have. [may have secn]

But this is merely another aspect of what wc have been stressing all along: cohesion is a featurc of texts,and the qucstion whcthcr a particular instance is a cohesive forn or not can often be settled only by reference to its textual cnvironment.\*

# 4.3.2 Lexical ellipsis

Neverthcless it may be helpful to approach thc discussion of verbal cllipsis through a consideration of those instances whcrc we cAN recognize that a particular verbal group is elliptical simply by inspccting its form.

If wc hcar only the following sentencc in a conversation

4:57It may or it may not.

we know that the verbal items may and may not must be elliptical.At least one word must be added following either of them in order to fill out'thc verbal group.The word may is a VERBAL OPERATOR cxpressing finite: indicative:modal'.It has no othcr functions, and cannot be a LExiCAL VERB.Hence nay and nay not havc no lexical verb in them, and this is sufficicnt cvidcnce to show that they are elliptical.

Any verbal group not containing a lexical verb is clliptical.Notc that the tcrm lexical verb'includes the verbal substitutc do discussed in 3.3 above. This enables us to idcntify one of the two typcs of vcrbal ellipsis, thc onc which we shall refer to as LExicAL ELLipsis. It is the type of ellipsis in which the lexical verb is missing from the verbal group. Thc other type is OPERATOR ELLIPSIs, described below in 4.33.

All the modal opcrators cancould will, would shall shouldmaynight, must ought to, and is to arc alike in that nonc of them can function as a lexical verb.Here is to stands for all thc forms am tois to are to, was to, were to;since this is a modal operator, it has no non-finite forns and no further variation in tense.Therc are two other modal operators, need and dare;but they can also be used as lexical verbs.We ignorc thc special case of $w i l l = "$ bring about by willpower,as in to will one's own destruction-as well as of coursc, will in to will one's fortune and can in to can fruit) So any verbal group consisting of a modal opcrator only can inmediately bc recognized as elliptical.Examples:

[4:58] Is John going to comc?-He might. Hc was to, but he may not. -He should,if he wants his name to bc considered.

Hcre night was tomay not and should are all elliptical verbal groups consisting of modal operator onlycach one of them could bc filled out by the lexical verb come, or by the verbal substitute do.

The modal operators are always finite, and hence always occur in first position in thc verbal group.There are other verbal opcrators,cxpressing not modality but tensc, which may be finite or non-finite any verbal group which cnds in onc of thcse is also clliptical,but here the situation is less clear becausc somc of the itcms functioning as temporal operators can bc lexical verbs as well.

The finite temporal forms willwouldshallshould all these arc temporal as wcll as modal and used to are ambiguous, like the modals; and so are thc non-finitc equivalents of $w i l f$ nanely begoing to and be about to.All these arc opcrators; a vcrbal group which ends in any one of them lacks a lexical verb and is thereforc clliptical. But be and have, which occur as temporal opcrators in all thcir forms, both finite and non-finite, function ALso as lexical verbs; so no simple rule can be given to say that a verbal group ending in a form of $b _ { \hat { \zeta } }$ or have is clliptical-it may or may not bc. The same applies to the one remaining vcrbal opcrator finite only) do, which is the carrier of negativc and markcd positivc polarity in simple present and past tense;in does see did see, etc,do is an operator, but do can also bc a lexical verb see above, 3.3.3.1 as wcll as being the verbal substitute.

To givc some further examples, the verbal groups may be, are going to have and did $( c f$ 3.3.3.6[3:89-91] are non-elliptica1 in[4:59 1]but elliptical in $\left[ 4 : 5 9 \left( 2 \right) \right]$ ...

[4:59]1non-elliptical: 2 (elliptical) a.He seems quite intelligcnt.-Hc a.Is he complainingmay be, I agree. He may bcI don't carc. b.I've decided to leave.-I hope b.I haven't finished it you're going to have second yct. $- \operatorname { I }$ hope you're thoughts. going to have by tomorrow. c.Did Janc know?-No,but c.Did Jane knowMary did. Yes,shc did.

Hcre the distinction betwecn elliptical and non-elliptical forms has to be rccovcred from the presupposed clausc. Thc lexical verbs be and have always rcquire a Complement.With all other verbs, thcrc is a gencral rule whereby if a Complement is omittcd by clausal cllipsis then thc lexical verb must also be either omitted or substituted.But this does not apply to be and have; these verbs may occur with ellipsis of the Complement, as in [4:591a)] and [4:561b and c)],the verbal groups themselves being nonelliptical. Hcnce all that can be said is that if there is no Complement following be or have thcre must be sOmE ellipsis;but it may bc ErrHER verbal ellipsis, with be, have as operator,OR clausal cllipsis $( c f 4 . 4$ bclow),with be, have as lexical verb,and in order to determinc whichit is necessary to refer to the presupposed clause. If there is a Complcmcnt, and the verbal group ends in be or havethcn thcre may bc EirHer verbal cllipsis with be have as opcrator, OR no ellipsis at all, and be have as Iexical verb; the clause in question is often ambiguous by itsclf, eg: he has some of the paintings in [4:60a] and she is the doctor in [4:60b]

[4:60]1non-elliptical: a.Has he all these items in his own collcction?-He has somc of the paintings; I'm not sure about the rest. b.She ought to know what to do. She is the doctor.

(2 (elliptical   
a.Has hc sold his collection yct?-He has some of the paintings; I'm not sure about the rest.   
b.Is shc suing the hospital?-She is thc doctor.

As far as do is conccrned, thc lcxical verb do also usually requires a Complcment, except in the special scnse of bc satisfactory, eg: will it do? Thc substitute dohowever,docs not;and a verbal group such as did in [4:59c] may be non-elliptical, with substitute do as in1or clliptical, with opcrator do, as in (2).Thc differcncc is shown by the fact that the non-presupposing form of (1) would bc Mary knew, with did REPLAcED by knew, whereas that of 2 would bc she did know, with thc elliptical form did FILLED our by thc lexical vcrb know.But since the vcrbal operator do occurs as a finite form only, and hence comes first in the verbal group, whereas thc substitute do is a substitutc for the lexical verb, and hcnce comes last, such instances of overlap can occur only with a verbal group consisting of just the one word,do, does, or did.

With do the ncgative forns are unambiguous, sincc only the opcrator do has don't, doesn't and didn't as its ncgative forms. This is bccause the operator do is in fact simply acarrier'of the exprcssion of polarity:ncgative (egdidnt see and marked positivc egdid see)the latter bcing the form used in intcrrogative clauses (did you see John not saw you John?. So any verbal group consisting only of don't, doesn't or didn't must be elliptical, and likewise any group consisting solely of do, does or did preceding the subject in an interrogative clause, eg: did you?

The lexical verb do forms its negative like other Icxical verbs: so we say he doesn't do his work properly,not he doesn't his work properly.Lexical be and have, on the other hand, form their ncgativcs likc vcrbal operators;hence he isn'tis he?he hasn't, has he? may bc eithcr clliptical opcrator only or non-elliptical (lexical verb).There is a rider to this; therc are actually two distinct lexical itens have, one meaning possess' and cxpandable into have got,thc other mcaning take'and not expandablc.Only the former has the ncgative has't (eghe hasn't any money)and that not in all dialects; the later forms its negative likc other lexical verbs,by means of thc operator do as in he doesn't have breakfast.Apart from this cxception thc ncgative forms isn't hasn't etc may be cither opcrator or lexical verbs, and hence one cannot say that a verbal group consisting of onc of these forms alonc is definitely elliptical: in [4:ss] thcy could occur in cither column 1 or column (2

Finally there is the form to.We have secn that this occurs as part of thc opcrators going toabout tonsed tois to and onght toand a vcrbal group in which to occurs finally, not followcd by a lexical item, is bound to bc elliptical (f3.3.2,[3:7o]).This applics also to a verbal group consisting only of thc word to,as a marker of the infinitive that is,of thc perfective form of the non-finitc verb,to see,to have seenctcfor example

[4:61] I'd bctter sce him.I dont rcally want to.

In what wc are calling I.ExicAl ELlIpsis,it is the lexical verb that is always omitted.Other words in thc verbal group may also bc onitted, with thc exception of whatcvcr word is in first position -thc finitc operator if finite, and to or an -ing form if non-finite. So we may havc, in answer to John should have been coming every day:

[4:62] 1 non-elliptical (2 clliprical   
a.finite: I don't think hc... has been coming has been has   
b.non-fniteperfecive At lcast I under- to have becn coning to have been stand him .. to have to   
c.nou-fnitimperftive I think hc rather having been coming having been regrets. having

Lexical cllipsis is ellipsisfrom the rightit always involves onission of the last wordwhich is the lcxical vcrb,and may cxtend leftwardto leave only thc first word intact. So for hs been coming we may find s been or simply has. With a very long verbal group therc would bc more possibilitics: could have been going to h consulied might be reduced,by lexical clipsis to could have been going to becondd hare been going tocond have been could have or simply conld. Usually the outcr'forms are preferred:that which is minimally elliptical with oNly the lexical verb omitted, or that with everything omitted that can bc presupposcd from thc context. So following wasn't John going to be consulted? wc would most probably find eithcr he could have been going to be or he could have been.But intermediate forms also occur.Note that thc extcnt of the presupposition is not affected by these variations.Thus in [4:62] the elliptical forms presuppose all thc tense selcctions as well as the lexical verb: the form has, in 2a)stands for has been coming and not has come. In gencral, any selcctions that are not explicitly repudiated arc automatically presupposed.

A very clear example of lexical ellipsis is provided by question tags.All question tags havc maximum lexical ellipsis and presuppose all the features of thc relevant verbal group;so

[4:63] a. John couldn't have been going to be consulted, could he? b.Mary didn't know,did shc? c.They'll have becn working on it all night, won t they?

The presupposition of particular systemic features is discussed in more detail in 4.3.4.I-4 below.

# 4.3.3 Operator ellipsis

Therc is another type of verbal ellipsis, which is ellipsis from the left'. We shall refer to this as OpERAtOR ELLIpsissincc it involves only thc omission of operators: the lexical verb always remains intact.Examplc [4:54] showed the difference between the two:[4:54a] is lexical cllipsis, [4:54b] is operator ellipsis. In operator ellipsis the Subject also is always omitted from the clausc;it must thcrefore be prcsupposed.

One typc of operator cllipsis, which is very frcquent, will not conccn us here, sincc it does not contribute to cohesion: this is operator ellipsis within the sentence, in the context of coordination. In this type it is possible to introduce a new Subject,as in $\left[ 4 : 6 4 \mathsf { c } \right]$ So for cxample in

[4:64] a. They must have bccn both watching and bcing watchcd. b.After we've brought them out so far and made them trot so quick. c.Some werc laughing and others crying.

the verbal forns must have been both watching and being watched)have brought...out...and made...and were (laughing and...crying are branchcd': the opcrators arc structurally related to both halves of the coordination.as indicated by thc brackcting.Note that this also happens in lcxical cllipsis, with one lexical vcrb bcing related to two or morc coordinatc operators; the most usual form of this is the coordination of positive and negative operator with or,as in

[4:65 Thcy might or might not have objected.

Verbal coordination of this type, however, accounts for a rclatively small proportion of the total incidence of lexical ellipsis, which is more often BETween sentences (and thcrefore cohesive in our sense).

Opcrator ellipsis, whcn it occurs across sentences, is found mainly in very closcly bonded sequcnccs such as question and answer,in which the lcxical vcrb cither supplics thc answer to do what?'as in [4:54b],or repudiates the verb in the qucstion, as in

[4:66] Has she been crying-No laughing

In most instances of operator cllipsis, everything is presupposcd but the lexical verb-that is,the entire selection within thc systems of tcnse,voice, polarity and so on; and all words except the last are omitted.Occasionally it is thc voice, the choice of active or passive, that is being repudiatcd, in which case if the elliptical group is passive the be inmediately preccding thc lexical verb must also be prescnt, since it is part of the realization of the selection of passive; for examplc

4:67] What have you becn doing-Being chased by a bull.

Operator ellipsis is fairly easy to recognize,with the provisos made in 4.3.1 abovc,since there is no finitc clcmcnt in the elliptical group. There are two sources of uncertainty,and thcse havc to be rcsolvcd by reference to the surrounding text.One is that in most verbs thc past tcnse and the past or passivc participlc have the same form, so that an iten likc made in $\bar { [ 4 : 6 4 }$ bj taken on its own could be a simple past tense instead of bcing elliptical for have made.Thc other problem is that a FInire verbal group wITH opcrator ellipsis is idcntical with a NON-FINITE verbal group that is NOT elliptical eg:being watchedmade,singingbeing chasedso that one has to ask whether the context demands a vcrbal group that is non-finite or one that is finite.But this is not usually much of a problcm, and it is furthcr simplified by the fact that the perfective form of thc non-finite verbal group nearly always has to at the beginning.Thc only point to note is that a non-finite verbal group may itself have operator cllipsis,either by sim.plc omission of to or,if it is markcd for tense, by omission of the tense opcratoror operators),eg

[4:68]1 non-clliptical: 2 elliptical: a.What do you want to do?-To Go out to thc pictures. go out to the pictures. b.Why was he so angry when the ganc was stopped?Because of having been losingNo; having bcen winning! No: winning!

As a final example,in

[4:69] What must I do next?-Play your highest card.

it is not very clear whether play is an elliptical indicative, for you must play, or a non-elliptical inperativc; nor does it sccm to matter very much.It is probably thc former: thc tag would be shouldn't you?, and we would probably find the same form following he, where it could not be imperative: What must he do next?-Play his highest card.But the difference in meaning is so slight that it is difficult to sense the ambiguity between the two.

# 4-3.4 Presupposition of verbal group systems

We will considcr in turn the various systcms of the verbal group, asking whether, and under what circumstances, they are liable to presupposition in cases of ellipsis: whether, that is, thc meaning is carried over when no sclection from the system is cxpressed in the structure.We shall refer to polarity finiteness, modalityvoicc, and tense; with a vcry brief mention of the system of contrastivencss that is found only in thc spoken language.

# 4.3.4.I POLARITY

Polarity is normally expressed at the beginning of thc verbal group. A negative verbal group,if it is finite,has n't or not attachcd to the first word, egdidn't knowdid not know.If it is non-finiteit has not usually as the first word,eg: not having known not to have knownalthough the not may somctimcs follow the first verbal opcrator, eg: having not known to have not known.Other negative advcrbs such as neverhardly hardly ever, may occur in place of not.The category of ncgative is not very sharply defincd, but it is revealed by the choice of tag.Thcre is a scmantic parallel betwcen he's here, isn't he? and he isn't here, is he? and thc fact that the corresponding form with hardly everis he's hardly ever hereis hewith positive tagshows that hardly ever is really a negative form.

In lexical ellipsis, whatever else is omitted the first opcrator is always present.This mcans that the polarity will always in fact be cxpressed, and the question of what happens if it is omitted does not arisc. This is a result of the structurc, although it is not simply a grammatical accident. The characteristic function of ellipsis is that of cohesion by presupposition, and there is a large class of cohesive sequcnces in which the onc thing that cannot be presupposed is polarity: namcly thosc whcre the response (eg: to a yes/no question) serves precisely to supply thc polarity, all clse being taken for granted.For cxample

[4:70] a.Were you laughing-- No, I wasnt. b.Cats like cheese.-They don't,do they Yesthcy do.-Well, some do and some dont.

This makes it easy to understand the gencral principle whereby, whatever clsc may bc presupposcd in verbal (lexical) cllipsis, the polarity has to be madc explicit. Thc principle applics to both finite and non-finite verbal groups; and in the non-finite (perfcctive) therc is a spccial elliptical form of thc ncgativc namcly not toas in I'd hate not to not to would be silly, which cxprcsses simply the non-finiteness and the polarity, and nothing else.Thcrc is an equivalent positive form to which is,however,much more restrictcd we say I'd love to but we do not say to would be silly f 3.3.2, [3:70c, d and e]

We should distinguish here the special type of negation in which thc negative is attached specifically to some other clcment in the verbal group as in

[4:71] a. I've kept on telephoning but thcy've simply been not answering. b.He says hc's been not bcing informed about these developments.

Herc thc verbal group itself is positive, and certain items or features in it are cxplicitly negatcd: the lexical verb answer in (a), the lexical verb inform and thc passive voice sclection in (b). In such instances therc is unccrtainty about whether the polarity is presupposed with lexical ellipsis.Conceivably the responsc He has to [4:71b] might be used to cxpress agrecment,ie he has becn not being informed'. But thcrc is a strong tendency in English for the polarity of the verbal group itsclf- that is, as cxpressed in first position - to determine the polarity of the whole, so that cven herc the negative is unlikely to be presupposed: onc would expect rather (Quite right.) He hasn't in the sense of $^ { \circ } \mathrm { I }$ agree'and $S h$ yes.) He has with contrastive intonation, in the sense of $^ { \circ } \bar { \mathrm { I } }$ disagree'.

Turning now to operator cllipsis, we might expect that herc, where among the items omitted is always the onc which carries polarity, the polarity would naturally be presupposcd by thc clliptical verbal group.In fact as a rulc it is not, although the reasons are diffcrent. As we have seen, opcrator ellipsis is characteristic of responses which arc closely ticd to a preceding qucstion or statcment, and which have thc specific function of supplying, confirming or repudiating a lexical verb. The following is a typical sequcnce, illustrating how thc polarity is restated each time:

4:72A:What are you doing (positive) B:Thinking. (positive;'I'm... A:Not day dreaming? negative;'aren't you...? B:No, thinking. positive;I'm...

If there is a change in polarity, this may go in cither direction,from positive to ncgative or from negative to positive;notc that the final occurrence of thinking in 4:72 does not take ovcr thc sclcction of negative from the presupposcd group.

One typical context for a verbal group with operator ellipsis is as a response to a WH-question with the intcrrogative on the verb, such as What are you doing? This is a demand for a lexical verb, and the normal response is simply to supply the verb,everything elsc bcing omitted.Here it might be said that the polarity is presupposed.But thcrc is rcally no way of testing this statement,since the verbal group in thc qucstion is bound to be positive; onc docs not ask What aren't you doing?except in the spccial instance of an ccho question,whcre the polarity clearly IS presupposed in the responsc, as in Sith isn't cooperating.-What isn't he doing?-Cooperating).The other most usual context is that of a yesno question and this is precisely a dcmand for the polarity to bc supplied; thc polarity cannot therefore be presupposcd.The words yes and no are purcly indicators of polarity, and thcy arc regularly elliptical forthe whole of the presupposed clause (sec below,44.3).But the speakcr may repcat thc lexical verb, in ordcr to deny it or explicitly to affirm itin this casc thc polarity is always restated and, intercstingly,operator ellipsis is possiblc only if the polarity is cxplicitly expressed - that is,if the answer is ncgative sincc the negative requires to be stated by not, with or without a preccding no or,if it is positive,provided it is introduced by yes

[4:73]1Weren't you complaining $\ell - ( \Nu 0 , )$ Not complaining 2Were you complaining?-Ycs, complaining.

$\mathrm { I n } \left( 2 \right)$ the answer could not bc simply Conplaining.If however the answer is a contradiction,involving a change of polarity,thc cllipticalform is much less likcly:b would bc prcferred toa in both [4:733 and4)]

[4:73]3Wcrcn't you com- a.Yes, complaining. plaining?- b.(Ycs,) I was complaining. 4Were you com- a.No,) Not complaining. plaining?- b.(No) I wasn't complaining.

Occasionally a ycs/no qucstion may be answered (or, norc accuratcly, responded to;such a response is not an answer with a different lexical verb, and herc, prcdictablyno ellipsis is possible:

[4:74]A:Were you thinking B:I wasn't daydreaming,if that's what you mean.

B's responsc could not take the form Not daydreaning

Hence in verbal cllipsis of any kind thc clliptical verbal group makes a new selection in thc system of polaritypolarity is not included in what is presupposed.In lexical ellipsis,this is because thc one clcment that must bc present,whatever else is omitted, is the initial elemcnt, and this is the onc that carrics the exprcssion of polarity. In the casc of operator cllipsis, the reason is scmantic rathcr than grammatical; thc cxprcssion of polarity is not requircd by thc structurc, but operator ellipsis is largcly restrictcd to responses in which either thc polarity can only bc positive and thc question of presupposition does not arisc or clse it is precisely the information yes or no?' that is being askcd for,in which case it cannot possibly be presupposed in the answer.

A considcration of marked polarity sf4.3.1 above would take us into too much dctail, but it nccds a brief mention to concludc this section. What is mcant by MARKED POLARity is thc assignmcnt of special prominence to thc sclcction of positive or negativc in ordcr to draw attention to it. In the finite verbal group this is rcalized by the use of non-rcduced forms of the finite operator orwhcrc relevant the negative:ishadwas, can shall, shouldctc instead of the reduced forms'sdll [waz] for was, [Sd] for should not distinct in writing)ctcnot instcad of n'tand also does see,did see instead of sees, sau.Notc that the non-reduced forms arc NOT necessarily TONic (primary strcss), though they must bc SALiENT sccondary stress).) In a verbal group with operator cllipsis,therefore,it is impossible to express marked polarity;even if thc prcsupposed item has itas in 4:75]whcrc doing is tonic and is is salicntit tcnds mcrcly to express the questioner's attitude,impatience or somcthing of thc sort:

[4:75] What is he DoinG all this time?-Readingprobably. $( / \mu ^ { \sf } )$ what/ is he/DOING/all this /time/

-in any casc it cannot be carricd over.A verbal group with lexical ellipsis, on thc other hand, must have the polarity markcd;so the finite operator cannot be reduccd:

4:76 a.Wholl put down five pounds-I will.not I'll b.John's arrived,has hc-Not yet but Mary has.(not Mary's)

This applies to all positive forms. Thc negative may or may not be reducedwe could have I won't in [4:76a]and Mary hasn't in [4:76b]-this is no doubt because the negative is itself a kind of marked polarity.The preference for marked forms of polarity in this type of verbal ellipsis is probably to be cxplained by thc fact that so often in sequenccs of this kind it is the expression of polarity that is the whole point of thc responsc.

# 4.3.4.2 FINITENESS AND MODALITY

The systems of rINIreNess and MoDALITy are also closely associated with first position in the verbal group, and this largely determines the possibilities of their presupposition by means of ellipsis.

A verbal group which is finite always expresses its finiteness in thc first word.Eithcr the group consists just of a finite form of the lcxical vcrb, present or past walk, walks; walked),or it begins with a finite vcrbal operator; the latter is either a tense operator:

I amis, are;waswere [ie finite forms of be]   
2 have, has; had [ie finitc forms of have]   
3dodoes;did   
4shall, will   
(s uscd (to

or a modal operator:

6 shalwill shouldwouldcancouldmaymightmustought to   
7 am tois toare to;was towere to [ie finite forms of beplus to]   
8need,dare in one use

Any verbal group which does not have a finitc form as its first word is automatically non-finite. A verbal group consisting just of the base form of the verb,eg: walk, is thercfore ambiguous: it may bc finite prcsent tense,egI walkor non-finite perfectivc,eg made me walk.But thc distinction is always clear in the context; morcover the non-finitc pcrfective ncarly always has to bcfore it (eg: wanted mc to walk).The impcrative form walk has something of thc finite and somcthing of the non-finite about it, but is best treated as a finite verbal form.

Verbal groups with operators are never ambiguous as to finiteness. It is true that have and do are ambiguous by thcmsclves; but do occurs as opcrator Only in finite verbal groups while have in a non-finite group is ALWAys preceded by to.

In lexical ellipsis,as wc have seen the cllipsis is from thc right'and the one element that is ncvcr omitted is the finitc operator.So, as with polarity, there is no qucstion of what happens if thc finiteness is not expressed; it always is. A verbal group that is lexically clliptical is always explicitly cither finite or non-finite. It cannot simply take over the selection made by the verbal group which it presupposes.

There is no restriction of the presupposition of a finite verbal group by a non-finite or vice versa.Wc may have all possiblc sequcnces:

[4:77] a. [finite presupposcd by finite] The picture wasn't finished. If it had been, I would have broughtit. b. [finite prcsupposed by non-finite] He's always being teased about it. I don't think he likes being. c. [non-finitc presupposed by finite] What was thc point of having invited all those people? - I didn't; they just came. d. [non-finite followed by non-finite] It was hard work parcelling all those books.-I'm sure it was; and I'd much prefcr you not to have.

With operator ellipsis, thc situation is exactly reverscd; here the first word musr be omitted, whatever clse is or is not present, and so the elliptical verbal group cannot cxpress the choice between finite and non-finite. As is to be expected, thcrcforc, it takes over the selection from the presupposed group:

[4:78 a.[finite:thcy are finishing] What are thcy doing now?-Finishing their cssays. b.[non-finite:to be finishing] What would you like thcm to be doing while you'rc away Finishing their cssays.

All that has been said with regard to finitcness applies cqually to modality.Modality ie the choice betwccn modal and non-modal, and, if modal, among thc various modal catcgories) is a subcategory offinite and is exprcssed by thc presencc or absence of a modal opcrator. In a verbal group with lexical ellipsis, thercforc, the modality is always cxplicit, and there is no restriction on what may bc presupposed by what:

[4:79] a. [modal prcsupposed by non-modal] I could help them.-Why don't you? b.[non-modal presupposed by modal] Are you going to tell her?-I ought to. c.[modal presupposed by same modal] He must have destroyed thcm.-Somcone inust havc, certainly. d. [modal prcsupposed by different modal] He must have destroycd them.-He may havc, I suppose.

In a verbal group with operator cllipsis,thc modality is never explicit and like thc finiteness,is always carricd over from thc presupposed group:

[4:8oa.non-modal:4:78a]they are finishing] What are thcy doing now?-Finishing their essays. b. [modal:'they will be finishing] What will they be doing now,do you think?-Finishing thcir cssays,probably.

# 4.3.4.3 VOICE

When we come to the system of voice (thc choice bctween active and passive) the position is somewhat different. Voice is expressed towards the end of the verbal group,by the presence (passive or absencc (activc) of somc form of be or get just before a lcxical verb,with thc Icxical verb in the passive participle form. Any verbal group displaying both thesc features is passive,eg was stolen has been robbed being takenget arrested all others are active.Thcreforc it does not follow automatically that an elliptical verbal group either will or will not contain an ovcrt cxpression of voice.

Nevertheless in lexical ellipsis the rule is quitc clear; the voice selcction is always presupposcd. So although the examples in [4:81] makc perfectly good sense, they arc impossible, bccause the elliptical form hcrc repudiates thc voice of the presupposed verbal group.

[4:81] a. [active followed by passive:if it had bcen finished] They haven't finished thc picture.If it had been.I would have brought it.

b. [passive followed by active:if shc does beat him] Johnny hates being bcaten at any game by his sister.If she docs, he sulks.   
c.[active followed by passive:'she has ncver becn loved'] Mary could love very decply. Unfortunately she ncvcr has been.   
d.[passive followed by active:'she has forgiven them'] She is forgiven, apparcntly.But I don't think she has them.

No doubt thc reason these are unacceptable is that the second sentencc in each case involves a change in the alignment of structural functions. Either the Subjcct changcs, the Actor/Goal relationship rcmaining the samc,as in a) and b)or thc Actor/Goal rclationship changcs.the Subject rcmaining the sameas inc and d).In cithcr instance,and cvcn if one element is an unexpressed someone as in (c),we feel the proposition should be rcstated in full. The voice selection,in other words, cannot bc repudiated by an clliptical structure; and the mere fact that the lexical verb necding to be supplied is already in thc right forn, as in a finished and d) forgivenis not enough to ovcrridc thc rulc that voicc must bc carried ovcr. Presumably we feel little in common bctwcen has forgiven and is forgiven, cven though the participle is formally the samc.

In operator ellipsis, as wc saw earlier, the Subjcct is always omitted;it must thcrcfore be carricd over by presupposition.This means that we cannot have a change of Subjcct for the clliptical group;so in an example such as

[4:82] Were Australia leading England at the time, thcn?-No, England were winning.

wc cannot replace the second scntencc by the elliptical form No,England winning.In other words,herc,as in lcxical cllipsis, the voice selection must be presupposed if the presupposing group is clliptical; it cannot be repudiated.But there is onc condition under which the voicc can be repudiated in opcrator ellipsis: namcly if the Actor/Goal rclationship changcs lcaving the Subject unaltered.One cxample of this was given in $\left[ 4 : 6 7 \right]$ above; others would be

[4:83 a.Will you be intcrviewing today?-No;bcing intcrviewed. b.John has loved Mary for a long timc.-Or at least bccn loved by her.

# 4.3.4.4 TENSE

The English tense system is complex, though its complexity is more apparent than real. It is based on two very simple principles: $\mathrm { ( I ) }$ that there is a choice of pastpresent and future, and $( 2 )$ that this choicc may be made rcpeatedly within limits),cach new choice taking the prcvious onc as its point of departure.Both these principles apply whenever a verb is used, unless that verb is in thc imperative, which has no choice of tense.

So, for cxample, I may choose a future tense: I will play.But having thus shifted my standpoint into the future I may then take this as a base for a further point, say past; I then get the tense past in future which is I will have played. Supposing once again I take this as a base line and sclect, say,present: the tensc is then present in past in futureI will have been playing.This can happen up to five timcs, subject to increasing restrictions which end up by precluding a sixth choice altogcther.Thc most complex tense form in English is one like had been going to have been playing, which ispresent in past in futurc in past in pastIt may bc helpful herc to list the full sct of finite and corresponding non-finitc tenses of the English verb. The column headed $\propto$ is the PRIMARY TENSE (FIRST ORDER TENSE);it is always cxpressed by a finite form,and a verbal group with primary tense is always finite.The othcr columns represent the sECONDARy IENSES SECOND ORDER, THIRD ORDER and SO On;the LASI ORDER TENSE is always thc onc that appcars carliest in the NAME of the tense.Thus prcsent in past in future'has primary first order tense future, and secondary tenses past and present, of which thc last order tense is present.

It will bc sccn that the non-finite forms,which arc also thosc of thc finitc verbal group if it is modalized,are equal to thc finitc non-modal forms minus the 'alpha-'or primary tense choicc. So,for examplc, non-finitc having taken corresponds to all three of thc finite tenscs took, has taken and had taken.

A tensc form cmbodying only onc choice is a simple tense; hence simple past'I took,simple prcscnt'I takesimple) futureI will take. All other tenses arc COMPOUND.

Like the tense system itself, the principles of the presupposition of tense selections in verbal cllipsis look rather complex at first sight;but actually they are fairly simplc.

Let us consider thc following instances of lexical cllipsis:

[4:84] a.I protest.-Do you? b.Hc usually talks all the time.He didn'tycstcrday c. It docsn't turn.-It will if you press it in first. d. She won't agree. - She did last time. c. Is he arguing?-Ycs, he always does. f.Was he going to apologize ? He won't now. g.Has she heard about it yct?-No, but she soon will. h. You have been forgctting cvery morning. Today you did again.

The choice of tenses in these examples is as follows:

Presupposed group Elliptical group a present present b present past present future (d future past present in present present f futurc in past future g past in present future (h prescnt in past in present past

In cach case the elliptical verbal group makes a simple tense choice, which is fully explicit in the operator (did does will) hence thc only presupposition is of the lexical verb, which is to bc supplicd in its base form.No tense selection is carried over from the presupposed group.

Now consider the case where the second verbal group, the onc that is elliptical, is making a compound tense selection. Here arc some acccptable cxamples:

[4:8s] a. At lcast Stan has tried.I don't think Bob has. b. I'm going home this weckcnd. I shall be every wcckend now. c.Arc you dicting?-I havc been for some time. d.Hc was going to build it himself. He isn't any longer. c.She really has been working hard.-And shc's going to be again bcfore long.

Presupposed group Elliptical group a past in present past in present b present in present present in future cpresent in present present in past in present (d future in past future in present e present in past in present present in future in present

Thc following however are much less acceptable:

[4:86] a.Have you discusscd it yet-No, wc arc now. b. You've been forgetting cvery morning. Today you have again. c. He was going to tell us. But hc still hadn't, yesterday.

Presupposed group Elliptical group a past in present prescnt in present b present in past in present past in present c) future in past past in past

For thesc to become acceptable,the second verbal group would have to bc filled out by thc lexical verb or verbal substitute:

a discussing itdoing b) forgottendone c told usdone

The principle scems clear. In compound tcnses, the tense selection is not madc clear by thc finite verbal operator alone;other elements are needed, and thc form of the lexical verb itsclf nay change. If the tense in the elliptical verbal group is a compound onc,then it must be such that the lexical verb can bc carried Over IN THE SAME FORM.So in $\left\lfloor 4 : 8 \xi \right\rceil$ thc clliptical verbal group could in fact bc filled out by the lexical verb with its form unchanged:a triedb goingc dietingdgoing tobuildc working.This means that the last-order tense, the onc that is ExpresseD last in thc verbal group (though it appears first in the NAme of the tcnse), is carried over from thc prcsupposed group.If this changes, then thc form of the lexical verb changes, and the lexical verb must be repeated (or substituted)as in [4:86].

To summarize: a verbal group with lexical cllipsis must have eithcr a tense that is fully explicit even in the elliptical form, or one in which the lexical verb can be carried over unchanged from thc presupposed group. In other words,cither it has simplc pastpresent or futurc;or,if the tensc is compound, it has thc same last-ordcr tcnsc as the presupposcd group. So,for example,if thc presupposed group has future in presenthe was going to leave,there can bc lexical cllipsis in a following verbal group provided that that verbal group has any simplc tcnse,eg past but he didn't f [4:84f]), or a compound tensc which is also future in .. eg future in present but he isn't now cf [4:8sd].It is not that all othcr instances are totally unacceptablc;we might acccpt but he hasn't in this instance,and the following also:

[4:87] a. I'm staying at homc this weekend. I haven't for some time. b.It was going to snow, thcy said.Why isnt it?

where a) has past in present presupposing prescnt in present, and b) has present in present presupposing futare in past.But thcse are all a littlc awkward, and a more natural form is that with substitutc do:I haven't done for some tine, why isn't it doing?

We have illustrated tensc in verbal cllipsis by reference to finite verbal groups; but the same principles apply to those which are non-finite, including instances where, of thc two verbal groups involved in the presupposition, one is finite and the other non-finite. Here are some varied cxamples:

[4:88] a. He shows no sign of having been studying.-He hadn't/hasn't wasn't. b.Shc intends tc comc.-Shc won't. c.Will he give in to thcm?-He doesn't seem to be going to. d.We sccm to be being followed.-I remember having been when we werc here bcforc.

Presupposed group Elliptical group finite: prcsent in past in past   
anon-finite:present in past finitc: prescnt in past in present corresponding to all three: finite:present in past   
bnon-finite:tenseless finite:future   
cfinite:futurc non-finitc:futurc   
d non-finite perfective:present non-finite (impcrfcctivepast

Verb forms which include thc sclection of 'future'at any point will normally be longcr, in tcrms of words, than thc corresponding forms with present or past in the sinple tense,past and present consist of one word only took,takes),future of two will take.The marked positive forms see 4.3.4 above of past and present arc did takedoes take and the paradigm of simple tcnses in spoken English is actually quitc synmctrical:

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2">present future past</td><td colspan="2">positive</td><td colspan="2">negative</td></tr><tr><td>unmarked marked he took hc did take</td><td></td><td>unmarked he didn&#x27;t take</td><td>marked he did not take</td></tr></table></body></html>

Hence as we havc already scen the elliptical forms of the simple tenses are all forms consisting of one word: he did, he does he will.But thc non-finite form of the future is be going to or be about to; this is thc form in which it occurs anywherc othcr than as primary tensc.This does not affcct thc principles stated above, but it makes it simpler to state them by refcrence to the tense systems:that is, in terms of the selection of tenses in the verbal group,rather than in terms of thc words that are used to express the tense sclections.

With operator ellipsis,which as we saw carlier is characteristically associated with qucstion-answer sequences whcre thc qucstion centres around the lexical vcrb,thc elliptical group normally takes cver thc total tense selection of the group which is prcsupposed.So:

$\left[ 4 ; 8 9 \right]$ a.What is hc going to do with all that paraphernalia?-Catch fish. $[ =$ He's going to catch fish] b.Have you been digging?-No weeding $\stackrel { \cdot } { = }$ I've been weeding] c.What should she have done?-Told thc policc. $\left\{ = \right.$ She should havc told thc police]

This type of cllipsis is vcry frequent, and the result looks like an ordinary non-finite verbal group. If the question is a simple present or past tense, therc is no possibility of verbal ellipsis in the response. as the verbal group consists of only one word.

It is possible for a vcrbal group in such contexts to rcpudiatc some or all of the tensc selection of the presupposed group, but this has to be donc explicitly - anything that is omitted through ellipsis will bc carricd over. So we undcrstand the response in [4:90]

[4:9o He must have mended it.-Or bccn going to mend it, rather.

as he must have been going to mend it. It is possible to construct ambiguous examples if one trics hard cnough, eg [4:91]

[4:91] Hc could have been going to mend it-or bc mending it where the response might be eithcr he could have been going to be mending it at somc particular time later,eg just when you arrived)or he could be mending it now).But thc gcneral principle is the usual one that whatever is not specifically repudiatcd is presupposed by the elliptical form.

# 4.3.5 Summary of verbal ellipsis

We can now give a brief summary of lcxical and operator ellipsis in thc verbal group.Lexical ellipsis, it will bc remembcred, is ellipsis from thc right thc final element in the verbal group, the lexical verb,is omitted, and preceding elements may be omitted, all except the initial operator. Operator ellipsis is ellipsis from the Ieft': the initial element in the verbal group (finite verbal opcrator,if finite;otherwise first non-finitc opcrator is omitted, and following clcments may be omitted,all cxcept thc lexical verb.

An elliptical verbal group carries over certain systemic selections from the group that it presupposes.The general principles regarding this presupposition are as follows:

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Lexical ellipsis</td><td>Operator ellipsis</td></tr><tr><td>Polarity</td><td>inapplicable (always expressed)</td><td>not presupposed</td></tr><tr><td>Finiteness and modality</td><td>inapplicable (always expressed)</td><td>presupposed</td></tr><tr><td>Voice</td><td>presupposed</td><td>presupposed can be repudiated under cer- tain conditions)</td></tr><tr><td>Tense</td><td>not presupposed (except last order selcction in compound tensc)</td><td>presupposed unless repudiated</td></tr><tr><td>Lexical verb</td><td>presupposed</td><td>inapplicable (always expressed)</td></tr></table></body></html>

This pattern is relatable to thc different contexts of thc two typcs of cllipsis.Operator ellipsis involves omission of the MODAL BLOck-the Subjcct and finite verbal operator see 4.3.6 and 4.4.1 below-in the clausc; this is the clcment that expresses mood.Opcrator ellipsis is thcrcfore characteristic of thosc contexts in which the mood is taken over from the previous clausc.Typically this happens within the sentencc, but wc are not considcring presupposition relations within the sentence bccause they do not form part of the total picture of cohesion, which is an intersentence relation.Betwecn sentences,the typical context in which there is presupposition of mood is that of qucstion and response;hence, as we have seen, we find operator cllipsis in answers to questions, particularly thosc where what is asked for is thc idcntity or confirmation of the lexical verb, eg: what are you doing?, are you thinking $( o r \ldots )$ ?So in operator cllipsis thc finiteness is always prcsupposed, whcrcas thc polarity never is. Tense and voice may or may not be;that is, thcy are presupposcd unless repudiatcd.

Lexical cllipsis, on thc other hand, leaves out nothing of the modal block, so that the mood of the clause is fully explicit: in a verbal group with lexical cllipsis thc finiteness is always expressed, so the question of its presupposition from an carlier verbal group does not arise.Lexical cllipsis occurs in thosc contexts whcre the lexical verb is not in question; thc lexical verb itsclf is therefore always presupposed, and so is the voicc, since the lexical verb carries with it the implications of its transitivity -if the love from John loves Mary is taken over by presupposition into thc next clause,then naturally this presupposition extends also to the fact that it was loves and not is loved by. If wc want to override this and talk about Mary loving John, we must restate it as a new proposition, in full.

Polarity however is not prcsupposed. In fact it is impossible not to restate the polarity,because it is ticd structurally to the initial operator, which is always present in lexical cllipsis.But behind this is a more important reason,namely that thc polarity may be precisely the question at issuc as in sequences like Did John come?-Nohe didnt.-Didn't e?as also in qucstion tags, which are not treated in detail here becausc they are within the sentence and thcrcfore not cohesive.Similarly, tense is not carried over; the primary tcnsc choice has to be restated,being cmbodied in thc initial operator, and tensc also may be up for considcration, as in John cane,didn't he?-Nobut he will.

Thus the pattern of prcsupposition reflects thc different functions of the two types of vcrbal ellipsis in bringing about cohesion within a text.We have illustratcd mainly with question-answcr sequences, because these allow us to display the cohesive relations more clearly in a short space. But verbal cllipsis is characteristic of all tcxts, spoken and written, and provides an cxtremely subtle and fexible means of creating varied and intricate discourse.

# 4.3.6 Verbal ellipsis and the clause

This final subsection is dcsigned to providc a link between the present section and thc next.We have seen that verbal ellipsis often entails the omission of other elcments in thc clause besides verbal oncs.Spccifically, operator cilipsis involves ellipsis of thc whole moDAL element in the clause, and lexical ellipsis involves ellipsis of the whole of the residue, thc PROpositioNAL elemcnt in thc clause.So,for cxamplc, the clause the cat wont catch mice in winter has as its structure on thc interpcrsonal dimension of mcaning):

<html><body><table><tr><td>the cat</td><td>won&#x27;t</td><td>catch</td><td>mice</td><td>in winter</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Modal</td><td colspan="3">Propositional</td></tr><tr><td>Subject</td><td colspan="2">Predicator</td><td>Complement</td><td>Adjunct</td></tr><tr><td>nominal group</td><td colspan="2">verbal group</td><td>nominal group</td><td>group prepositional</td></tr></table></body></html>

If this is followed by Or chase birds, with operator clipsis,then thc Subject the cat is onitted as well as the verbal operator won't. If it is followed by won't it?with lexical ellipsis, then thc remainder of thc propositional clement, consisting of thc Complement nice and the Adjunct in winter,15 omitted along with thc lcxical verb catch.

Verbal ellipsis is always accompanied by thc omission of thc related clause elements, those that are in thc same part of thc clause as the rclevant portion of the vcrbal group.So in operator ellipsis, where there is omission of the finite part of thc vcrbal group thc Subject is also omitted; in lcxical ellipsis, where thcre is omission of thc non-finitc part of the verbal group, all Complemcnts ard Adjuncts arc also omitted. Thesc clements arc omittcd, that is to say,unless they are explicitly repudiated.It is 1mportant to note that they can be repudiated; we night have, with iexical ellipsis.

[4:92] The cat won't catch mice in winter.

a.[operator cllipsis;Subject repudiated:nor will the dog chasc rabbits in winter'] -Nor the dog chase rabbits.   
b.[lexical ellipsis;Complcmcnt repudiated:it will catch birds in winter'] -It will birds.   
c.|lexical ellipsis; Adjunct rcpudiated:it will catch mice in summer'] It will in sumner.

But if thcre is verbal ellipsis, thcn any structurally-rclated elemcnt in the clause that is not contrastive with that in the presupposed clause must be omitted also.You cannot say,following [4:92] above:

d.-Nor the cat chase birds repeating the cat) c.-It will birds in winter (repeating in winter f.-It will micc in summer repeating nice nor is it possible to use a reference item in this context,eg d Nor it chas birds. Such elements can be rcpcated or referred to only provided there is no verbal ellipsis: nor will the catit chase birds, it will chase birds in winter thenit will chase micethem in summer.Hence in an examplc such as

[4:93] Have you checked this page?-I have (done) THIs page.

the answer is possible only with this in a contrastive scnse, mcaning either a different pagc, or this page in contrast to others.

The principle here is that which is common to all forms of ellipsis: namely,that although the structural clcments themselves are not present in the elliptical item, the features that are rcalized by thcsc clements ARE present.So a clause in which there is operator ellipsis of the verbal group has no Subject; but if thc clause presupposed by it is indicative (indicative being thc feature realized by the presencc of a Subject),then it also is indicative even though it has no Subject.Similarly a clause in which there is lexical ellipsis of the verbal group has no Complement or Adjunct,but it takes over any of thc fcatures realized by these elements (type of transitivity; timc, place,manner, etc that are present in the presupposed clause.Therefore if thc elliptical clause is making a DIrreReNr selection within these features-referring to a different time, a different goal,different location, etc-this Must be expressed ovcrtly, in ordcr to repudiatc thc previous selection; and on thc othcr hand if it is making the same selection- ie if therc is no contrast between the two clauses with rcspect to a given selection - this cANnor be expressed overtly.Anything clsc would conflict with the basic function of ellipsis, which is to crcate cohcsion by leaving out under definitc rules, what can be takcn over from the preceding discourse, making explicit only what contrasts with it.

Finally, we should mcntion thc limits of cohesion through verbal ellipsis, in terms of the function of the clause in question.An elliptical verbal group cannot in general presuppose a verbal group in an cmbedded clause (one that is cmbedded in the narrower sense of the word, ie RA NKSHIFrEDf 3.4.2 above).Consider for example:

[4:94] a. The policeman paid no attention to the girl who was driving the car.-Was she? b.The policeman paid no attention to Mrs Jones, who was driving the car. -Was she?

[4:94a] is impossiblc; here who was driving the car is genuincly embedded (rankshifted), so that it becomes part of the nominal group the girl who was driving the car. In [4:94b],however,where who was driving the car is not rankshifted, but is related to the other clause by hypotaxis, the response is quite acceptable. A clause which is rankshifted loscs its functional identity as a clause: it does not operate as an element of thc sentence. But a hypotactic clause does not lose its identity; it is still an clement of sentence structure, and so readily serves as the target of presupposition from another sentence. This is the basis of the distinction between hypotaxis and rankshift, which tends to be obscured in thc use of the term 'embedding'; and cohesion provides evidencc of the importance of this distinction. Similarly:

[4:95] a. I shall stay in thc city when I retire this year.-Do you? b.I shall stay in the city, cven though I retire this year.-Do you?

Here again, the clause when I retire this year in a) is rankshiftcd and therefore cannot be presupposed; so [4:9sa] is unacceptable.But the clausc even though I retire this year in (b) is hypotactic; this, thereforc, is accessible by presupposition, and [4:9sb] is a perfectly good example of cohesion by verbal ellipsis.

# 4.4 Clausal ellipsis

# 4.4.1 Modal and propositional

We have included under verbal cllipsis all instances of ellipsis in the verbal group.Howeverboth types of verbal ellipsis,both operator cllipsis and Iexical ellipsis, also involve ellipsis that is external to the vcrb itself, affecting other clements in the structure of the clause.

We can thereforc look at these two types of ellipsis from another anglc, taking thc clausc as the point of departure. The clause in English, considered as thc cxpression of thc various spccch functions, such as statement, question, rcsponse and so on, has a two-part structure consisting of MODAL ELEMENT pIUS PROPOSITIONAL ELEMENT $( c f$ 4.3.6 above), for examplc

[4:96]1The Dukc was going to plant a row of poplars in thc park (Modal clcment)(Propositional element)

The moDAL element, which embodies the speech function of thc clause, consists in turn of the Subject plus thc finite element in thc verbal group. Strictly, the part of the verbal group that goes in the modal block is simply the finiteness, which may not be realized in a separatc clement: it may be fused with thc remainder of the verb,as in simple past and present tenses planted plant(s).The PROPOsITIONAL ELEMENT cOnsists Of the residue: the remainder of the verbal group, and any Complcments or Adjuncts that may be present.The difference between a Complement and an Adjunct is, bricfly, that the Complement could become a Subject if the clause was turned round in some way, eg: a row of poplars was going to be planted by the late Duke; whereas the Adjunct could not.

In the favouritc clause type thc Modal elemcnt precedes the Propositional, though it nced not do; wc may have

or [4:96]3A row of poplars the Dukc was going to plant in the park. Proposi-Modal clcment -tional element

The two types of verbal ellipsis are derivable from thesc two major divisions of thc clause. Under ccrtain conditions there is cllipsis of thc Modal element: thus

[4:97] What was the Duke going to do?- Plant a row of poplars in the park.

In the answer, thc Modal clcment is omitted:the Subject and,within the verbal group, the finite operator was. Hcncc thcrc is operator ellipsis in the verbal group. In other circumstanccs thcrc may bc cllipsis of thc Propositional element:

[4:98]Who was going to plant a row of poplars in the park-The Duke was.

Here therc is omission of the Complcmcnt and the Adjunct,and, within the verbal group, of the lexical verb plant: so we have lexical ellipsis in the verbal group. The verbal clement going to,which is ncither finite operator nor lexical vcrb-it is a non-finite tense opcrator- is omitted in both examples here:this is one of thc featurcs of verbal ellipsis which cannot be accounted for simply by referencc to thc clause it was dealt with in a preccding scction4.3.4.4.

Therc is no need to repeat hcrc the details of what from thc clausc standpoint are modal ellipsis and propositional ellipsis, since those have alrcady been discussed in connection with operator cllipsis and lexical ellipsis in the verbal group.In brief,modal ellipsis is associated with a context where there is no choicc of mood in the clause- mood, thc choice of declarative, intcrrogative impcrativc and their subcategories, is the rcalization of speech function, and is cxprcssed by the Modal clcmcnt. Likewisc, in modal ellipsis the polarity is detcrmined, and the Subjcct can be presupposed from what has gone beforc. Typically, in other words, modal ellipsis occurs in responsc to a WH-question asking what (did,does, etc) .dof[497]above:

[4:99] What were they doing-Holding hands

Thc usual typc of non-finite dependent clausc is, in fact,simply a clause with modal ellipsis;but it is one which presupposcs another clause within the same sentence,this bcing what is meant by dependentand so it does not enter into cohesion; an example would be

[4:1oo Holding hands they stole quictly out of the house

Propositional ellipsis, on thc other hand,is associated with thosc instances where the mood and the polarity are the principal componcnts of the message: typically,responses to statcments and yesno qucstions, whcre the subject is presupposed by a reference item, as in

[4:1oi a. The plane has landed.-Has it b.Has the planc landed?-Yes,it has.

It is also found in response to WH- qucstions whcrc the unknown element happens to be thc Subject (f [4:98] abovc):

[4:102] Who taught you to spell?-Grandfather did.

In gencral, in a finite clausc with eithcr of these two types of cllipsis thc verbal group will also bc clliptical:

<html><body><table><tr><td>Clause</td><td>Verbal groupe</td></tr><tr><td>1 modal cllipsis</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2 propositional ellipsis</td><td>operator cllipsis lexical cllipsis</td></tr></table></body></html>

But thcre arc certain circunstances under which this docs not hold.

1Modal/operator cllipsis.If the verb is in simple past or present tense, modal cllipsis may not involve opcrator ellipsis; noreover it is not always possible to say whether it does or not:

[4:103] a.What did he do?-Ran away. (Run away.) but note: What did he do, run away) b.What do they do?-Run away. c.What does he do?-Runs away.Run away.)

It would be possible to have run away inc and also in a); thcy would then be, appropriatcly, instanccs of opcrator ellipsis, since thc fuil forms would be He runs $\left( = d o e s + r u n \right)$ away, He ran $( = d i d + r u n )$ away. There is some ureasincss about run away in these contexts, perhaps because it APPEARs to bc finite and thcrefore wrong, either in numbcr or in tense) on the othcr hand the non-elliptical forms also sccm wrong, because they are clcarly finite and yct lack a Subject,which is contrary to normal patterns. So the preferred form is often that with pronoun Subject added: he ran away, he runs auay.With [4:1o3b] the problem does not arise, sincc the non-finitc run would in this case also be thc approptiatc finite form

(2) Propositional/lexical ellipsis. There are two occasions when propositional ellipsis does not involve lexical cllipsis.One is very general: the spcaker may use thc substitutc do rathcr than the elliptical form of thc verbal group (see above,Chapter 3cspecially 3.3.2).Hercspcaker as always, includes writcrbut in fact substitution is more common in spoken than in written English, ellipsis bcing oftcn preferred in writing. Morcover, as already noted, there is considerable variation among different dialects; and there are individual diffcrcnces also.But with some speakers, at least, thc substitute form of thc verbal group may bc uscd in all instances of propositional cllipsis except those where the verb is passive, which do not substitute at all, and thosc where the vcrh is be or have, which substitute'for thcmselves (the verb do does in fact substitute by do, though the result docs not show).But substitution is less usual in questionanswer sequences,which have markcd polarity and thcrefore are more often elliptical.Some examples:

[4:104] Presupposed Elliptical Substitute clause form form Full form   
aHas the plane Yes it has. Yes it has done. Yes it has landed? landed.   
b) Kecp out of It has. It has done. It has landed. sight till the plane lands.   
cWho was Peter was. Petcr was doing. Peter was playing the playing the piano? piano.   
d)Was John No.Peter was No.Peter was No.Peter was playing the though. doing, though. playing the piano? piano,though.   
c)Arc the rest Yes, they are. Yes they are finished? finished.   
(fDoes Jane Yes, shc does. Yes, she does do. Yes, she does sing? sing.   
(gDoes Jane No, but Mary No, but Mary sing? does. sings.   
h Has May Yes, she has. Yes, shc has Yes,shc has done her donc. donc her homework? homework.   
(j Has the Yes, it has. (Yes it has Yes,it has been weather been been.) cold. cold?   
k Ihear Smith He has. (He has had.) He has had an is having an operation. opcration?

Strictly spcaking in [4:1o4g] there is no elliptical form f [3:91] in 3.3.3.3), although effectively thc distinction between ellipsis and substitution is ncutralized here.This is,in fact.the second of the two occasions where propositional ellipsis does not lead to lexical ellipsis and itis not very intercsting;namely,in simple past or present tense with unmarked positive polarity, where thcre simply is no distinct elliptical form.Hencc the difference betwcen (f) and $\left( \underline { { \boldsymbol { \mathfrak { x } } } } \right)$ above: whereas in $\left[ 4 : 1 0 4 \right]$ there Is a distinct form with lexical ellipsis, becausc the verb has marked polarity (the full form is does sing), in [4: 104g] therc is not - thc polarity is unmarked and thc full form is simply sings.And since the verbs be and have (ie the have mcaning possesswhich is replaceable by have got, as in he had a yachtnot that meaning takeundergoetc as in he had an operationhe had breakfast) do not take the verbal opcrator do -thcir marked positive form is simply thc non-reduced is,has,by contrast with reduced's,ctc these verbs NeveR have an elliptical form in simple past and present tense. So

[4:104]cont'd. Presupposed Elliptical Substitute clause form form Full form   
(fDoes Jane Yes, shc does. Yes, shc does do.Yes, she docs sing? sing.   
(gDocs Jane No, but Mary does. No, but Mary sing? sings.   
1Is he Ycs, he is. Yes, hc is suspicious? suspicious.   
mIs he No, but John is. No, but John's suspicious? suspicious.   
n Has he(got a Yes, he has. Yes, he has (got) prejudice a prcjudice against it? against it.   
Has he gota No, but John has. No, but John prejudice has(John's got) against it? a prejudice against it.

Some varieties of English treat this have likc the majority of othcr verbs and use the operator do with it; for speakcrs of such varictics, cxamples n and o would not bc valid.

To summarize the circumstances under which clausal cllipsis, modal or propositional, may be found unaccompanicd by ellipsis in the verbal group: opcrator cllipsis may be avoidcd in simple past and present tense; and substitution may be used in most instances instead of lexical ellipsis, thc two bcing indistinguishable from each other in simple past and present unmarked positive form),and indistinguishablc also from the full form in the casc of the verbs be and have ( $\circleddash$ possess).Otherwise, verbal ellipsis and clausal ellipsis go together.

The ncxt section 4.4.2 dcals with somc instances of the omission of singlc clemcnts in thc clause. After that wc go on to consider clausal cllipsis in its typical context of qucstion-rcsponsc and other typcs of rcjoinder, first in direct spcech4.4-3 and then in indirect spccch 4.4.4).A final scction refers to cllipsis. in clause complexes (4.4.5)

4.4.2 No ellipsis of single elements

It is not possible in English to say [4:105] Has she taken hcr mcdicine?-Shc has taken.

Either we must reply with a full, non-clliptical clause she has taken her medicine (or she has taken it, using rcfercnce to prcsupposc her medicine)or we must omit BotH her nedicine AND thc lexical verb take and say she has or she has done, using the substitute do in its place.Let us tabulate these, from the point of view of ellipsis:

[4:1o6 a. Has shc taken her medicine iNo ellipsis: 1 no presupposition She has taken her medi\~ cine. 2presupposition of Complement by reference She has taken it. (ii) Clausal ellipsis: 1 with verbal ellipsis She has. 2with verbal substitution She has done.

It may bc helpful to givc equivalcnt sets for do,have and be:

[4:106 b.Has shc done her c.Has she had d.Has she been homework? her breakfast? unhappy? 1She has done her She has had her She has been homework. breakfast. unhappy. 2She has donc it. She has had it. (ii1 She has. She has. She has. 2She has done. She has had. She has been.

We cannot say she las been it at least not in answcr to has she been unhappy?,although this would have becn acceptable if the Complement had been a nouneg:Isn't it time she was secretary-Oh no,she's been it already.)

Thc notion that do,have all senses and be substitutc for themselves'is useful n cxplaining the forms givcn undcr ii2).If thesc were not substitute forms, they would be impossible in the same way that She has taken is impossible: it is not possible to leave out thc Complement but rctain the Predicator (verbal group) intact.

This in turn is part of a vcry gencral restriction on ellipsis,whereby it is not possible to omit single clemcnts from the structure of thc clausc.If a single element of clause structure is to bc presupposed, for purposcs of cohesion, it must be expressed by a refcrence itcm; so (to vary example [4:96])

[4:107] Thc Duke has planted poplars in the park.

Presupposing: we have: aThe Duke He has planted poplars in the park. b) poplars The Duke has planted them in the park. c in thc park The Duke has planted poplars therc.

We cannot onit he in a or them in b); and although we could omit there in (c),in thc scnse that it would still leave an acceptablc clause structure, there would be no presupposition and therefore no fcature ofplace' in the clause. There is no type of clausal cllipsis which takes the form of the omission of single elements of clause structure.

It should be stressed oncc again that wc arc confining our definition of ELLIpsis to its non-structural, cohcsive sensc; that is, as a form of presupposition between sentences.Within the sentence, we find intcrnal BRA ncHiNG which may involve the omission of singlc clcments of clause structure (as well as structures of any other rank), for cxamplc:

[4:108] a.John loves Mary but is loved by Jane b.Either Petcr will play his cello or Sally hcr guitar. c. Annc cut out and Sarah sewed a dress for every doll.

Similarly for combinations of two elements:

[4:108] d. Sybil takes coffee very strong but Joan rathcr wcak. e.We climbed Great Gablc on Tuesday and Sca Fell two days later.

But here in all instances the two parts are structurally related, by coordination,and the patterns of occurrence are quite different.The sane explanation holds for

[4:108] f.The cat catches mice in summer.-And the dog rabbits. g.The cat won't catch mice in winter.-Nor the dog rabbits.

Evcn though these arc writtcn as separate scntences, thcy arc in fact linked by coordination; this pattcrn would not bc possible with but, so or other conjunctive elements (scc Chapter 5).

Aside from this structural branching thcre remains onc other phenomcnon which is to be distinguishcd clearly from cllipsis; this is not in fact an instance of omission and involves no prcsupposition of any kind,but it is sometimes referred torather confusingly,as if it was a form of ellipsis in the clause.Examples would be:

[4:109] a. Sinon's playing.Lets not interrupt. b.Sandra cleans for me when I'm out. c.Run

Thesc arc somctimes described as clliptical forms of, eg, Simon's playing the piano,Sandra cleans the flat, You run Actually however they are systematic variants in which nothing is omitted, any morc than an expression of time or place can be said to be omitted'from a clause which does not contain one. They have no systemic features which are not expressed in their structure.It is misleading to call them 'elliptical'because this suggests they have some cohesive function similar to that of the elliptical forms we are discussing here, whereas in fact they have none. If there was ellipsis of the Complement, they would presuppose the Complement, which they do not. Thcy do not presuppose any preceding item; in general, they cannot occur in contexts where thcre is presupposition, for example

4:11o a.Does Sandra clean thc windows-She cleans for me when I'm out. b.They asked Simon to play some Chopin.When he started playing, it was Liszt.

In a the one thing the response could not mcan is she clcans the windows for mewhich would make it like [4:1os] abovc.This is borne out by [4:11ob], whcre the response is quite acceptablc and started playing clcarly does NOT prcsuppose Chopin.

We have emphasized at various points in the discussion that the distinc tions we are drawing,whilc thcy are uscful and important for explaining thc patterns that lie bchind thc construction of text,arc not to be taken too rigidly.When wc say that there is no type of clausal ellipsis consisting in thc omission of individual elements of structure of thc clause, we are stating a generalization, one which explains why certain theoretically possiblc clause types cannot occur independently - though they may occur in branching structurcs. This does not mean that a single clement of clause structure can never bc presupposed under any circumstances.We can have sequcnces like

[4:111 a.Wc went on the river yestcrday. We had dinncr out too. b.Can you read the print without your glasses?-No,butI can look at the pictures.

where the second scntencc in a) also refers to ycsterday'and thc response inb) refers to without my glassesBut thcsc are not elliptical sentences. They merely imply, in the particular context in which thcy occur, the particular time,manncr, ctc rcferred to in the preceding sentcncc.So in [4:111b] the responsc implics I can look at the picturcs without my glassesbut it does not itsclf cnbody a feature of manner, nor is without my glasses in any scnsc omitted from it.

At thc same timc thc line between what is elliptical and what is not elliptical is not a completely sharp one. Most instances are clear; thcre is no doubt that the omission of modal and propositional elemcnts in the clause, as in [4:97] and [4:98],is to be explaincd as elliptical, whcrcas the types represented in $\left[ 4 : \operatorname { I O O - I } \operatorname { I } \operatorname { I } \right]$ are not.But thcre are somc doubtful instances.For example it night reasonably bc suggested that in [4:112] the second scntence is actually benefactive, thc Beneficiary hin bcing omitted by ellipsis:

[4:112] Are you sending Jack anything for his birthday?-I thought of sending a book token.

Howcver, there appear to be no examples of the omission of just one element from the strUCture of a clause WHERE THAT ELEMENT IS OTHERWISE OBLIGAroRy- of the Subject, for example, or a Complcment following a verb which must have a Complement $( c f [ 4 : \mathrm { { I o s } } ]$ above).Hence instances which on othcr grounds could be interpreted either as clliptical or as nonelliptical, but which if regarded as elliptical would take the form of the omission of a single element of clause structure, should perhaps for that very reason bc excluded from thc category of ellipsis. This is a theoretical decision, and one which would allow us to formulate a very general principle about cohesion in thc clause.

This principle is as follows. Other than in a question-answer environment (to be discussed in thc remainder of this chapter), the basis of both cllipsis and substitution- and thesc, as cxplained carlicrare essentially the same phenomenon-is the rwo-part structure Modal plus Propositional'. One or other of these clemenrs may bc presupposed, as a whole; but the smaller elements which make them up - Subject, Complement, PredicatorAdjunct-may not bc presupposcd in isolation.Thc facts on which this principle is based are oftcn indetcrminatc, as the facts of language always are;we do not force thcm into a mould, but in the uncertain instances we choose that interpretation which brings more of them within thc scope of a singlc gcncralization -provided it is one which makes good sense.Here it does. It is the Modal-Propositional structure which cxpresses the function of the clause in the discourse, so it is natural that this structure should provide the means for integrating any clause into a coherent text togcthcr with what has gone before.

# 4-4-3 Ellipsis in question-answer and other rejoinder sequences

Not all qucstions havc an answcr;but no less significant is the fact that not all answcrs have a question. The question and answer'sequence is a standard pattcrn in language,and not surprisingly the special type of cohesive relation that subsists between an answer and its question has its own characteristic grammatical properties.At thc same time thcre are other sequences involving rcjoindcrs of one kind and anothcr.

Let us first makc some terminological distinctions.Any observation by onc speaker, whether it is a question or not, may be followed by an observation by another speaker that is related to it by some cohesive tie.We shall refer to this very general category of sequel as a REJoinDeR. A rejoinder is any utterance which inmediatcly follows an utterance by a different speaker and is cohesivcly relatcd to it.

A rejoinder that follows a question will be called a REsronse.Within the category of responses there is a further distinction between DiReCT RESPONSES and INDIRECT RESPONSES.A direct respOnse is One which answers the question; it is cither a form of yes' or no'if thc question is of the yes/no type, or a spccification of thc information askcd for by the WH-clcment, if the qucstion is of the WH-typc.An indirect response is either one which comments on the question (comMeNrARy) or one which denies its rclcvance (DisclAIMeR), or one which gives supplcmentary information implying but not actually expressing an answer (SUPPLEMENTARY RESPONSE).

A direct response will also bc referred to as an ANs weR. But note that the category of answer, which is the supplying of the particular information that is called for by the question,is not linitcd to responses, bccause One can answer one's own questions.

Other rejoinders, not following a question, include Assen1 and cONTRADICTION, following a statement;CONsENT and REFUSAL, following a command; and yes/no or WH-qucstion following either a statement or a command.

Some examples of all thesc types:

[4:113] a. It's going to rain. $- \left( \mathrm { i } \right)$ It might.i It isnt.i Is it b.Lcave mc alone.-(i I wont.ii All rightI will.iii) Why

The sequel sentences arc rejoinders, sincc they are cohesive utterances by another speaker; but thcy are not responses, because the presupposcd items are not questions. [4:113a] is a statement, to which the rejoinder is i an assent(ii a contradictionii a ycs/no qucstionb is a command, to which the rejoinder is i a rcfusal,(ii a consent,(iii) a WH- qucstion.

[4:113]c. Has John arrived?-Ycs,he has. d.When did John arrive?-Ycsterday.

Here the two sequels are rejoinders of the response'type, and both are direct responses, or answers; they give the information that is bcing sought.

[4:113] e. How did they brcak in-I'll show you how. f.Why didn't you tell John?-I did.

Here the sequels are still responses, but indirect; the first is a commentary, the second a disclaimer.

[4:113] g. Did you tell John?- He wasn't therc.

In (g) the response is also indirect,but here the answer is implicd...so I couldn't); these we shall call supplementary responses. Finally

[4:113] h.Did I lock the door Yes of course I did.

Hcre thcre is only one spcaker, so the sequel is not a response;but it is an answer, since it gives thc information rcquired.

4.4-3.1 DIRECT RESPONSES (1):YES/NO QUESTIONS

Answers to yes/no questions, or POLAR QUestions as they havc been callcd, arc very simply dealt with, as the instruction Answer yes or no suggests: the appropriate answer is yes or no.Thc words yes and no express simply a feature of polarity.Thcy do not mcan (as do their dictionary equivalents in somc other languages)'you are right'and you are wrong' thcy mcan thc answer is positive' and thc answer is negative'Hence thcir meaning is unaffected by the polarity of thc qucstion; contrast the forms of thc positive in French:

[4:114]   
1Qucstion 2Answer positive 3Answcr,negative   
a.Are you Yes(Iam) oui] No (I'm not) [non] coming?\~   
b.Arcnt you Yes (I am') [si] No (I'm not) [non] coming?-

In this connection it is intercsting to note that both yes and no occur morc often as rcjoinders to statements than they do as answers to qucstions; here both of them signalI agreeI undcrstand,I'm listening-keeping the channel of communication open -and the choicc of onc or the other simply follows thc polarity of the prcceding statement:

[4:11s] a.Thc soloist wasnt very inspiring.-No,he seemed rather tired. b.Thc car's running very well.-Yes, I had it scrviced rccently.

It is possible to considcr yes and no as clausc substitutes.But they are not really substitutcs; for one thing, they can be accompanied by part or even thc whole of the clause for which they would be said to bc substituting, and that is prccluded from substitution as usually defined.For example in [4:114a] the answer2 could be yes ycs I anor yes I am coming.Thcy arc realizations of a single clause feature, that of polarity, which is being expressed on its own instcad of in association with the verbal group; and thc fact that it is expressed on its own mcans that thc wholc of the rcmainder of the clause is presupposed; hcnce thcir cohesive effect.

The words yes and no cxpress simple polarity.There are also complex cxpressionssomc meaningeither yes or noegmaybeperhaps,and some meaning both ycs and noeg sometimes sually.The former are often combined with some modality, the speakcr's assessment of the relative probabilitics ofyesand noeg:probablypossibly.All thcse are appropriate answers to yes/no questions; and thcy are also cohesive, since they presuppose all the remaining features of the clause other than the polarity.

If the answer yes, or other exprcssion of polarityis accompanicd by just a part of the clause,this will be the Modal element yes I an no Im not, sometimes he doesperhaps she has possibly they might and so on.The Modal element is itself sufficient as an answer,sincc it also carries thc polarity and prcsupposcs the Propositional element of the clause); so [4:114a] could be answercd sinply by I am I'n not. If both occur as in yes I a thcy function jointly as the rcalization of a direct answer as distinct from

[4:116] Did you sce anyone?- Yes, Shirley.

whcrc thc sccond part of the answer,Shirleyis an indircct responsc, giving supplcmcntary informationsee 4.4.3.3 below).

4.4.32 DIRECT RESPONSES 2WH-QUESTIONS

At first sight the answer tO a WH-questiOn,Or NON-POLAR QUESTIoNseems very different from the answer to a yes/no question, since the information that is being sought by thc two types of qucstion is very different.A WH-qucstion requires the spccification of a particular item which is as it were missing from the clause.Thc respondent knows what the function of this item is in thc clause structure, sincc this has been supplicd by the qucstionerhe knows thc total structure of the clause,in fact, and also the actual itcms that occur in all the othcr functions.He merely has to fill in the blank.The WH-cxpression itself indicates whether thc missing itcm is participant or circumstance,and various othcr things about it: if it is a circumstance,whether it is timc,place, cause, manner, etc when where, whyhowand an open-ended set of forms such as what time, what withlike whatwhich way,for whose sake);ifit is a participant,whether it is from a limitcd sct which) or not,whether human who,which/what personctc, or possessive whose,ctc or non-human what,which/what thing, etc)and whcther the question is one of degree how mch/manyhow long, etc or of kind what kind,like what,ctc).

The simplest form of answerthcrcforc,is one which does merely fill in the blank: which supplics the appropriate nominal, adverbial or prepositional group to act as Subject or Complement or Adjunct, and as Actor or Goal or Beneficiary or Temporal or Locative or whatever function is required.So for example:

[4:117]a.What did I hit-A root.ComplementGoal b.Who killcd Cock Robin?-The sparrow.(Subjcct;Actor) c.How much does it cost?-Five pounds.Complcment Range) d.How's the patient?-Comfortablc.ComplementAttribute) e.Till what time arc you staying?-Half past three.Adjunct Temporal) f.What did you draw it with?-A pencil.Adjunct Instru\~ ment) gWhosc gloves arc these?-Sally's.ComplcmentIdentifier)

The principle underlying thesc answers is, however,cxactly the same as that which governs the answers yes and no to a question of the yes/no type.

In cach case, when giving a direct responsc in its simplest form the spcakcr makes explicit just one thing, the information that thc qucstion calls for, and leaves all thc rest to be presupposcd by ellipsis.With a yes/ no question, this information is the polarity,so the answer specifies the polarity and prcsupposcs all clsc.In aWH-question, the information requircd is the item occupying a particular function strictly,a particular complcx of functions in the structure; the answer specifies this and presupposes the remainder of the clause. Hence the principle of clausal cllipsis, in clauses which are answcrs to questions, is general to all types of question. Any clause functioning as answer,in thc scnse defincd above see 4:113C and dj), has an clliptical form consisting of just onc clcment.Which clcmcnt this is is explicit in thc form of the qucstion, and all rcmaining features of thc question clause\~exccpting,of course,its interrogative moodare presupposed..

Just as with a ycs/no qucstion we may also have longcr,partially elliptical or cntirely non-clliptical) forms of answcr, so too thcsc may be found with WH-questions.If the WH-item is Subjcct thc answer may,like the answer to a yes/no question,have propositional cllipsis;this is because the Subject falls within thc Modal element. So the answer to [4:117b] might be The sparrow did.Whcther or not thc WH-item is Subject, the answer can be filled out with no cllipsis at all; we could have The sparrow killed Cock Robin in answer to [4:117b] and You hit a root in [4:117a].If the WH- item does not form a complete nominal or prcpositional group by itself eg: whose gloves, what...with till what tine) then thc simplest answer is one in which there is not only clausal ellipsis but also cllipsis within thc group, cither nominal (cgSally's in $\left[ 4 ; \operatorname { I } \operatorname { I } 7 \dot { \operatorname { g } } \right]$ for Sally's glovesf 4.2.3.1[4:24] above or prepositional.We have not discussed the ellipsis of prcpositions in thc Adjunct as a separate topic, since it occurs only in this context; it is howcver illustrated by $E : I \bar { \mathrm {  ~ \curlyeqno 7 \mathrm { e } ~ } }$ and f], where the prepositions till and with arc presupposed in thc answer. In such instances there is an intermediatc form of answcr in which thc group is not elliptical but the clause is;so we could have

[4:117 e.Till what time are you staying?-Till half past three. f.What did you draw it with?-With a pencil. $\mathbf { g } ^ { \prime }$ Whose gloves are these?-Sally's gloves.

There is no WH-verb in Englishwc cannot ask youre whatting the cggs?- or rather, since thc WH-item comes first in the clause, whatring are you the eggs? Instead we have the form what are you doing to the cggs? This involves the use of the pro-verb'do, in the combination do what

3.3.3.3).The exprcssion do whatlike do thatpresupposes the whole of the propositional elemcnt in the clause othcr than anything that is repudiated, so that the question what are you doing? is appropriatcly answered by a proposition ie a clause with modal cllipsis rather than just a lexical verb, although the proposition might consisr just of a lexical verb.Thus relaxingfrying cggs, feeding the ducks in the park could all answer do what? questions. If the do what? is not intended to embrace the entirc proposition the items that arc not being asked for are made explicit, eg what were you doing in the park? Such items however can never occur as nominals; they must take the form of a prepositional group.Following do what?, a preposition is required even with an item functioning as Goal in thc clause structure, usually to or with

[4:118] a.What are you doing with thc eggs?-Poaching them b.What have thc children done to the whcclbarrow?-Broken it.

This is in accord with thc gcncral principle whereby all PARTic1PANTs in the structure of the clausc, in English, may be relatcd to the verb cithcr directly as nominals or through the mcdium of a preposition; the prepositional form is used to make the function cxplicit where this is necessaryas it is hcre because we do not know what thc verb is.\* The answer follows thc normal pattern except that if therc is a Goal-Complement in thc qucstion it is usually presupposed by pronoun rcferencc rather than by cllipsis; so wc have them and it in the answcrs in [4:118].

# 4.4.33 INDIRECT RESPONSES

Therc is one kind of rcsponse which is not an answcr in thc defined sense, but is what wc callcd an INDIRECT RESPONSE; this may be a COMMENTARY,a DIsCLAIMER Or a SUPPLEMENTARY.Any questiOn may be grectcd by a coMMENTA Ry, which is really a statemcnt about the speakcr's attitude to thc answer: his ignorance of it, for example, or his consent or rcfusal to givc it.These,since thcy are in fact reports, have the elliptical potentialities of rcporting-reported sequences as described in 4.4.4 below.Examples arc and $c f \left[ 4 : \operatorname { I } \operatorname { I } 3 \mathrm { e } \right] )$ ..

[4:119] a. Is it Tuesday today-I don't know. b.Why are the lights turned off?-I'm not supposed to say why.

Likcwisc, any qucstion nay bc followed by a D1sclAimeR, which sidcsteps thc qucstion by disputing its rclcvance.Typically, a disclaimer involves moving from a yes/no to a WHI-context, or vicc versa,eg and $c f$ [4:113f]

[4:12o] a.When did they cancel the booking?-Did they? b.What's your telephone number?-We'rc not on the phone. c.Have you tested the battcry?-How?

Some qucstions are framed so as to be difficult to disclaim, such as thc notorious When did you stop beating your wife?, to which there is no ELLIPTiCAL response meaning unambiguously $^ { * } \mathrm { I }$ never have beaten her. Normally however a responsc of the disclaimer type is elliptical; either it is declarative, with propositional ellipsis, or it is interrogative, in which case it is of the opposite type to the question, and has response-question ellipsis (see below).

The third type of indirect response is a SUPPLEMENTARY REsPONSE, which gives information other than that which is askcd for but answers the question by implication, for examplc (and $c f [ 4 : \operatorname { I } \operatorname { I } 3 \operatorname { g } ] )$ ...

[4:121 a.Can you make it stand up-If you keep still. b.Have we a car here?-Not unless you came in yours. c.Did you get the application form?-It's on my desk. d.Are you coming back today?- This evening.

Characteristically these supplenentary responscs prcsuppose the entire question;and they stand in a definite structural rclation to it-or rather to the declarativc clause which would serve as a dircct answer to it,by which they would be filled out.In [4:12ra]for examplc, the full form would beYes I can make it stand up f yon keep still:that is the direct answer with thc supplementary response hypotactically relatcd to it, as a condition. The answer is positive unless repudiated by not, as in [4:121b]; the supplementary is usually conditional or causal yes if..yes because...)although it may bc simply coordinated as in [4:12rc]ycs and...) and [4121d]ycsmore specifically $\therefore \therefore \rangle - { }$ or even with an adversative implicationthe presupposed answer then bcing negativeno but...) as in

4:122Did you collcct the subscriptions?-Smith did.

Supplcmentary responses are typically associatcd with yes/no questions; it is difficult to answer a WH-question by implicationand the nearest equivalent form of rcsponse to a WH-question is really a type of disclainer, like [4:12ob].But thc various typcs of indirect response are all fairly similar and cannot be kept strictly apart.

# 4.4.3.4 A NOTE ON ZEUGMA

As a postscript to this discussion of cllipsis in responses, we might add a brief note on zcugma.Zeugma is bascd on cllipsis and both the WH-and the yes/no types of question afford exccllent opportunitics for zeugmatic answers.These involve a transfcr from one element of clause structure to another;with a WH-question this can bc achicvcd by a direct resqonse ie an answer)as in [4:123a and b],but with a ycs/no question it requires an indirect,supplementary response of the no but..type,as in [4:123 and d]:

[4:123a.What has he been making-A big mistakc. b.How did you travel?-In considerable discomfort. c.Did shc makc him a good wife?-No,a good husband. d.Was he shot in thc street?-No,in the shoulder.

In b), for example,how is intendcd in thc question as 'by what means? but is interpreted in the answer as in what condition.In its classical form as a figurc of rhetoric,zcugma is embodied in coordinate structures,wherc the pattern is one of structural) branching and not cohcsion egwe travelled in buses and great discomfort).But thc principle is thc sanc.

# 4.4.3.5OTHERREJOINDERS

We have alrcady mentioned the difference between a response and a rejoinder. A response is one kind of rejoinder, one which presupposes a question, and which therefore has spccial potentialities for ellipsis,as discusscd in4.4.3.1-2direct responses)and 4.43.3indirect responses).A rejoindcr is any uttcrance by a second speaker which presupposes that of the first speaker whether it was a question or not.We rcfcrrcd above to the frequent use of yes and no in rcjoinders to statemcnts. From thc point of view of cohcsion, there is no distinct catcgory of rejoinder; it is simply an ordinary elemcnt in a dialogue, and is covercd by what has been said about ellipsis in general. But there remain a few observations to be made about rejoinders that arc not responscs to a question,but cohcsive sequels to a statemcnt or a command.

QUEsTION REJOINDERs havc the function of qucrying a preccding statcment or command, or eliciting supplemcntary information about it. 1One typc is that which presupposes thc cntire preceding clausc and seeks confirmation of it as a whole; thesc arc ycs/no questions and nearly always have thc form of interrogative clauses with propositional ellipsis, like the question tag at thc cnd of a declarative or imperative clause, exccpt that with the rcjoinder thcrc is a different speaker and the polarity is never reversed.Ior example

[4:124a.Peters herc.-Is he b.Open that parccl.-Shall I? c.'I can't believe that!'said Alicc. Can't you?'the Queen said in a pitying tone.

2 In another typc the speaker idcntifics one itcm as requiring confirmation; the rcmaindcr of the clause is omitted but this item is quericd explicitly:

a. John?To dinner 4:125 John's coming to dinner. b.Tonight? c.And MaryNot Mary

Thesc are three typical instances. In a) an cxisting clcmcnt is echoed;in (b) a ncw element is added; and in c) an cxisting clemcnt is expanded, here by coordination.But the form of ellipsis is thc same in all three; only one clemcnt in the clause is present in the structure, the remainder bcing presupposed by ellipsis.

Finally thc spcakcr may similarly focus on one item in thc clause but query it in thc forn of a WH-question.Corresponding to [4:12sa] wc have the echo qucstion'represented in [4:126a], neaning plcasc rcpeat that'I didn't hearI'm surprisedctc);this is the only typc of WHquestion which must be spoken on a rising tone. Corresponding to [4:125b] is [4:126b],where thcWH-itcm represcnts a ncw element and the wholc of the clause is prcsupposed;and to [4:12sc],[4:126c] where the WH- item who else asks for expansion of an cxisting element by coordination.

a.Who?tone2 [4126] John's coming to dinncr.b.When? c.And who clse?

In some instanccs the rcjoinder asks for more spccific information about an item that is already present:

[4:126d.John's coming to dinncr.-John who e.Alice heard thc Rabbit sayA barrowful will doto begin with.A barrowful of whatthought Alicc.

Often the item requiring furthcr spccification is itself indefinite $( c f [ 4 ;$ 129d] below),eg:Someone's coning to dinner.-Who? This type could also perhaps bc matched in the ycs/no series illustratcd in [4:125]John's coming to dinner.-John Smith?Someone's coming to dinner.-John?

The othcr types of rejoindcr to a statcnent or command usually take the form of an elliptical clausc consisting of thc Modal constituent onlythat is, onc with propositional ellipsis-with pronoun Subjcct,but in the declarative form.In [4:127]a) is an assent,b)a contradictionc a consent andd a refusal:

[4:127] a.Everything's just as it was!' Of course it is'said thc Qucen. b.... being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing. It isn'tsaid the Caterpillar. c.Our fanily always hated cats: nasty, low vulgar things! Don't lct me hear the name again!' I won't indecd!'said Alice, in a grcat hurry to change thc subject of conversation. d.Never mind what they all say, my dear, but take a returnticket cvery time the train stops. Indeed I sha'n't!'Alicc said rather impatiently.

These forms often combine with yes and no, as in the following:

[4:127 c. It's none of thcir business.-Yes it is. f.It must come sometimes to jam today"Alice objected. No, it can't, said the Qucen.

As was remarked earlier,yes and no also occur alone; thcy are the forms of expression of positivc and ncgative polarity when everything clse in the clausc is omitted by ellipsis:

[4:127]g.Its cold.-Yes. h.We'rc not late.-No.

These arc both instances of assent. In contradiction, the Modal constituent of the clause is usually added, and it must bc added if the contradiction is positive;so in h) we could not have just yes as a rejoinder (and cf(e) above).The same pattern is found following a command; we may have yes or no alone,but if yes occurs following a negativc command, and therefore signals a refusal, it must be accompanicd by the Modal elemcnt of the clause:

[4:127]j.Dont tell anyone what you saw-Yes, I will k.Don't let's go back!-Yes, let's.

All these rcjoinders could be filled out'in a non-elliptical form.But the pattern which is most typical of ordinary dialogue is that described here, with just one element made explicit, and the remainder presupposed. This use of ellipsis to cxpress the cohcsive relation between a rcjoinder and the utterances which preceded it, in scquenccs which are not structured as question-answcr,is a vcry characteristic aspcct of the texture of linguistic intcraction.

# 4.4.4 Ellipsis in reporting-reported' sequences

Therc is one further context for clausal ellipsis, that of rcported speech. The type of ellipsis found in this contcxt is closely related to some of the instances that we have already mct, particularly the commentary'typc of indirect responsc [4:119], and the elliptical WH-question as rejoinder [4: 126]. Here thcrcfore we shall not be introducing a new type of elliptical structure,but bringing together various instances alrcady met with which have something in common.

What they have in common is thc featurc REpORTED,which is present in indirect specch: that is,indirect statements, yes/no questions and WHquestions.Thcsc are cxemplificd in their full form in the sccond clauscs of [4:128a, b and c] respectively:

a.(that hc was coming. [4:128] John didn't tell mc b.if/whether he was coming or not c.why hc was coming.

It is perhaps important to point out that thc speech function of the report (statement, ycs/no question, WH- qucstion) is a feature of thc whole complex,even if the same verb(eg:tell occurs in all types.Thec reported clause itself makcs no indcpendent selection of mood, and examples such as I asked John why was he late or I asked Mary would shc enjoy it are not true interrogatives, as shown by thc fact thatin thc followingar:a2 and b1)b2 arc not proportional

I) (2) a) you'll cnjoy it will you cnjoy it? b) I askcd Mary if she'd cnjoy it.I asked Mary would shc cnjoy it.

4.4.4.IINDIRECT WH-QUESTIONS

If the reported clause is an indirect WH-qucstion, it can be elliptical in the same way as its equivalent direct question the WH-type intcrrogative clause. For example:

[4129 a.Who could have broken those tiles?-I cant think who.

b. I said you would mend it for him. -- I hope you didn't say when.   
c.Thc jewels are missing. $- \operatorname { I }$ wonder what clsc.   
d.Thcy still have some copies in stock.-Did you ask how many?

Thc target of presupposition is not, of course, the immediatcly preceding clausc, which would be thc rcporting one, but the preceding sentence; eg in a) who presupposes...could have broken those tiles and not $I$ can't think. This is possible bccause a reportcd clause is not embedded; the reporting-reported structure is a hypotactic one (f3.4.2 abovc; also 4.3.6, $\left[ 4 : 9 4 \right]$ and [4:95])and thereforc thc rcported clause can reach out beyond the bounds of the sentence in which it occurs.

Thc conditions under which elliptical forms tend to occur in indirect qucstions are those we have already met with in explaining cllipsis in dircct questions f [4:126] above).Thc cchotype occurs where the presupposed clause was itselfa WH-question,as in [4:129a];here however the elliptical clause docs not take a rising tone (tone 2), sincc it is not itself interrogative.In [4:129b] a ncw clcment is added which was absent from the clausc that is presupposcd. In (c) and (d) an clcment already present in the presupposed clause is offered for expansion, cithcr by coordination (c) or by further specification (d).Characteristically in the last instance the item in the prcsupposed clause is a non-specific form, with some- (someone, something,ctc), or thc indefinite article or other non-specific deictic (see 4.2.3.2 above).

As in a direct question, all features and elemcnts of the presupposed clause are carried over unless repudiated.The presupposed elemcnts may includc part of a nominal or prepositional group where the WH-item is a modificr such as which, whose, how many; in an example such as [4: 129d], in addition to thc clausal ellipsis there is also nominal ellipsis, since how many could bc filled out as how many copies.The mood of thc presupposed clause is always repudiated,by the WH-item itsclf.Other clcments also are sometimes repudiated, particularly the finitc opcrator; in such instances, however, the WH-clause normally has to be non-elliptical, unless thc WH-elcment is the Subjcct (which allows for propositional cllipsis) as in Who's going to lead the way?- I can't think who could.

4.4.4.2 INDIRECT YES/NO QUESTIONS

If the reported clause is a ycs/no question, thc most usual elliptical form of it is simply zero:

[4:13o] a. Was that an earthquake?-I don't know. b. I wonder whether England won the cup. Have you heard?

All features of the presupposed clause are carried over.All, that is,cxcept the polarity.Polarity has a special mcaning in a ycs/no question,different from its meaning clsewhere; it cxpresses thc questioner's attitude to the question, as in Don't yon know? meaning I'm surpriscdyou ought to know In an indirect question which is clliptical, thc polarity is simply neutralized.)

In thesc instances the presupposed clause is itself a question, direct or indirect, and wc could conclude that this feature is also presupposed in the elliptical clause. It is not necessary for thc presupposed clausc to be a question, however, in order for the ellipsis to be interpreted in this way. If the verb in thc reporting clausc is onc that introduces a qucstion, such as ask, thcn the elliptical reported clause will be interprcted as a question whatever the mood of the prcsupposed clause. In [4:13ra] the indirect yes/no qucstion whether he was or not is entirely omitted by ellipsis cven though the presupposed clause is not a question of any kind:

[4:131] a. John was very disappointed by thc responsc.You can ask him.

A more usual typc is that in which there is a modality in the presupposed clause:

[4:131] b. She might be better living away from home. I'm not sure.

- and these in turn are related, as was pointed out in the contcxt of the discussion of clausal substitution (3.4.1.1), to elliptical modalized clauses in which everything cxcept thc modality is presupposed:

[4:131] c. I wonder if it'll rain on thc day of the picnic.-Probably.

4.4.4.3INDIRECT STATEMENTS

For an indirect statement, there is no equivalent clliptical form containing just the marker of the featurestatement Herc the cohcsive form of thc reported clause is the substitute so, or its ncgativc not, as in

[4:132] I thought Mary was lcaving today.-She hasn't said so.

This has bccn discussed in 3.4.1.1.The clliptical form is again simply zero, asin

[4:133] a.This mango is ripe. I know from its colour. b. England won the cup.-Who told you?

Again the whole of the presupposed clause is carried over, including thc polarity; but an elliptical indirect statcment of this kind docs not nccessarily follow immcdiately after the prcsupposed clause, and thc cxact domain of the presupposition is sometimes rather uncertain. Consider for example

[4:134] a.John's new cabinct is beautiful. I'vc seen it bcing madc.You can tell him.

Does this mean you can tell him it's bcautifulor you can tell him Ivc secn it being made'or both? If wc cxpand thc sccond sentence to

[4:134] b.John's new cabinct is bcautiful. I'vc sccn it being made; it's ncarly finishcd.You can tcll him.

the amount of uncertainty becomcs cven greater. Even where there is no doubt which clause is presupposed, therc may still bc some more room for uncertainty, usually centring around thc expression of modality; for example

[4:135 a. He hasn't finished.-I should have known

b.Didn't you know? You can go home. c.No one will know.

Here a) might mean either I should have known that he hadn't'or I should have known that he wouldn't'. More clearly still, whereas b) means didn't you know that you can?'c means 'no one will know that you havc gone'.The pattern of detcrmination here is not easy to sort out.

# 4.4.4.4 AMBIGUITY BETWEEN INDIRECT STATEMENTS AND INDIRECT QUESTIONS

Fundamentally this is the same kind of ambiguity as may arisc bctween a statement and a yes/no qucstion if the rcporting verb is one that can introduce either, such as tell, say report know and the reported clausc is omitted by ellipsis. For examplc, in

[4:136] a. I think thc cheque is still valid.The Bank can tell then.

it is not clear whcther thc mcaning is the Bank can tcll them that thc chequc is still valid' or thc Bank can tell thcm whether the cheque is still valid or not'. Again, it is not casy to state exactly what the relevant factors arc; but the following examples would prcsumably not bc ambiguous:

[4:136] b. The chequc is still valid. The Bank can tcll them. $\stackrel { - } { } = \stackrel { } { }$ 'that it is')

c.Thc Bank can tell them. $\ r = \mathbf { \cdot }$ whether it is') Thc chequc may still be valid. d. The Bank told me $= ^ { \cdot }$ that it may be)

With say thc zcro'form of the reported clausc ncarly always presupposes a question:he didn't say is likely to mcan whether... not that... But with othcr verbs,and also with some adjectives such as clear, the presupposed clausc may be cither qucstion or statcment. Therc is perhaps a tendency herc for a zero'reported clause to be interprcted as a qucstion if the reporting clause is negative, as it frequcntly is with these ambiguous expressions (it isn't clear, he didn't say arc more likcly to occur on their own as reporting-rcported structurcs than it is clearhe said);on thc other hand, whercas I dont know is probably whether..., I didn't know is more likely to bc that... As [4:136] shows various factors both in thc reporting clausc and in thc prcsupposed clause sccn to bc rclevant to thc intcrprctation.

# 44.45 REPORTS AND FACTS IN RELATION TO CLAUSAL ELLIPSIS

We should distinguish here betwecn reported clauscs and fact' clauses cf above, 3.4.I.1).A RepoRr clauscas already noted is related hypotactically to the clause that contains the reporting verb;a sentence such as John said Mary was leaving consists of two clauses the second depcndent on (ie hypotactically related to) thc first. A FAcr clause is embcdded,in the strict sense of downgraded in rank, or rankshiftcd the sentence John predicted that Mary was leaving consisrs oF only one clause, which has embcdded within it another onc that no longer functions as a clause but functions as a nominal. Thcrc arc various differenccs betwecn report and fact, which wcre summarized carlicr $\left( 3 . 4 . 5 . 5 \right)$ notc that somc verbs can occur with cither. Because of the structural difference between thc two, a reported clause can bc cxpressed cohesively through substitution or cllipsis, whercas a fact clausc cannot.We have seen that there is no ellipsis of single elements in the structure of the clause; a fact clausc, bcing embedded, functions as a singlc clement, and hence cannot be omitted on its own.This explains why we cannot say

[4:137] a. The opportunity has now been lost.- I sincerely rcgret.

A fact clause can on the other hand be exprcsscd cohesively, as all singlc clcments of the clausc can,by means of reference; so [4:137b] is quite acccptable:

4:137 b.The opportunity has now bccn lost.-I sinccrcly regret it/thc fact.

# 4.4.5 Clausal ellipsis and clause complexes

Two or nore clauscs that are dircctly related in structure as distinct from bcing rclatcd indircctly through rankshift) arc said to form a clAUsE cOMPIEx.A clausc complex may be cithcr PARATACIIC or HYPOTA cric. In a paratactic clause complcx thc clauses have equal status.The rclevant paratactic relation is that of coordination, ie and' and or'; there are two others namely apposition and quotation,but we can ignorc them here. In a hypotactic complex the clauses have unequal status.Therc are three types of hypotactic rclation in the clausc: conDirion (expressed by clauses of condition conccssion causc, purpose, etc),ADDitiON cxpressed by the non-defining relative clauscand REpoRr.Paratactic and hypotactic structures may combinc freely in a single clause complex.

We conclude this chapter with a few observations on clausal cllipsis in clause complexes.This is a big topic, and we have not attcmpted to trcat it in full. We confinc ourselves to types of clausal ellipsis not covered by thc discussion on verbal ellipsis;csscntially to question-answer, and reportingreported sequences.

The general principle is clear: an clliptical clausc of whatcver typc may prcsupposc any clause in a complex, and will then automatically prcsupposc in addition all clauses that are contingent on it: that is, all that come after it if paratactic and all that are dependent on it (if hypotactic).So for examplc:

[4:133]a. Smith was going to take part,but somebody telephoned and asked to sce hin urgently so he had to withdraw.- Who? b.I kept quiet because Mary gets very cmbarrassed if anyonc mentions John's name.I don't know why.

In a),which is paratactic, who? coheres with somebody;the presupposcd clause is sonebody tclephoned, and the remainder of the sentence also fall ivithin the domain of the presupposition: the mcaning is who telephoned and asked to scc him urgently such that hc had to withdraw?'.Likewise in the hypotactic cxample (b), the meaning is I don't know why Mary gets cmbarrassed if anyone mentions John's namc'The first clause,in each case, is outside the domain of what is presupposed.

Howcver, thcre arc a numbcr of restrictions and limitations on this principle, as well as possible sources of ambiguity within it. Ambiguity may arise because it is uncertain which is the clause that is being presupposed,for example

[4:139] a. So you kncw thc lawyer was responsible.1 hadn't realized.

mcaning that you knew ... or that the lawycr was responsible'. Compare

[4:139] b. I finishcd writing that story and it's going to be published. When?

meaning  when did you finish ...?' or when is it going to bc published?. A number of factors come in to dctcrmine what is thc likely intcrprctation. Some of them are quitc specific; for example, if $\boldsymbol { I }$ in [4:139a] is stressed contrastively (tone 4),the second interprctation becomcs overwhelmingly probable:you kncw that the lawycr was responsiblc, but I didn't'.But there arc also some general considerations. There is a tcndency to presuppose what is ncarer; that is, to presuppose an element that occurs later in thc clausc complex rather than an carlier onc, espccially if the later onc is rather long. (This makcs the contrast bctween a clause complex and a simple clause with cnbedding (rankshift) in it cven greatcr.Embcdded clauses tend to occur in later positions; and since they cannot bc presupposed,the target of presupposition in such cases tends to bc towards the beginning.Comparc [4:94] above; [4:94b] is a hypotactic clause complex, whercas in [4:94a], which is a simplc clause with embedding, the appropriatc rejoinder would be Didn't he?presupposing the policeman.) In particular it is unusual to presuppose a dependent clause that precedes the clause on which it is dependent; an example such as $\left[ 4 \colon \operatorname { I } 4 0 \mathrm { { } a } \right]$ is rather unlikcly although there are instances, such as [4:14ob], which secm to pose no problem:

[4:14o] a.Seeing that Mary's left somcthing bchind I rcally think we should turn round and go back to the hotel. I'm not sure what. b.Unless he gives up onc of his bishops he's going to bc in trouble. It docsn't matter which.

Often an indcfinite form such as somebody is such a clear invitation to presupposition that its prescncc is sufficicnt to override any linmiting tcndencies of onc kind or another. In a very complex structurc there are many clauses which would be potential candidates for presupposition, and for prccisely that reason presupposition by cllipsis tends to be avoided, since it would Icad to too much ambiguity moreover thc clauses which occur later in the complex, and arc thcrcforc more accessible from the point of view of distancc, arc also, in the case of hypotaxis, at greater depth and thcrefore from anothcr point of vicw less accessible-because an elliptical clause which prcsupposed thcm could not be filled out. A sentence such as [4:141 a] is intractablc in this respect:

[4:141] a.I shall be cross if you brcak that vase, which was a present from my boy friend.-Which?

-if Which? means which boy friend?'the filled out form would presumably bc Which boy friend was that vase, if I break which you will be cross, a present from?Nevertheless, given a clear invitation to presupposition in the presupposcd complex, such instances become possible; if, for cxample, the first sentcnce of [4:141a] ended which was a present from someone I love, the rejoinder Who? would cause no difficulty; compare [4:141b and c]:

[4:141] b.I'd like you to look at the painting, which my wifc picked up somewhere in the country.-Where? c. Smith said if he could afford it he was going to buy thc nextdoor house and rent it to someonc he knew so as to keep it from bcing pulled down to make way for a block of fats.- Who?

Presupposition of a paratactic clausc complex by clausal ellipsis is possible only if all clauses following thc onc that is prcsupposed are within the domain of thc presupposition.In practice this usually means that they must be branched;that is,they must sharc at least onc clcment in common, typically though not necessarily thc Subjcct.So wc can accept [4:142a], but hardly [4:142b]:

[4:142] a.I lcft my books hcrc and somebody came in and either borrowed them or put them back on thc shelf but didn't say a word to me.I wish I could find out who. b.I left my books here and somebody complaincd and the librarian put them back on the shclf but didnt say a word to me.I wish I could find out who.

However, the conditions which dctcrmine acceptability are by no mcans clear. It does not always turn out as expected, and presupposition can extend over a considerablc structural distance.We have often cited examples fron Alice (and cf example [3:40] in this connection) so perhaps the last word should remain with her:

[4:143] And who are these?'said the Quccn pointing to the three gardencrs who were lying round the rose-trec; for, you sec, as they wcre lying on thcir faces, and the pattcrn on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they wcre gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children.How should $\breve { I }$ know?'said Alice.

# Chapter 5 Conjunction

# 5.1 Conjunction and other cohesive relations

The fourth and final type of cohcsive relation that we find in the grammar is that of conjunction.Conjunction is rather different in nature from the other cohesive relations,fron both reference, on the one hand,and substitution and ellipsis on the other. It is not simply an anaphoric relation. Conjunctivc elements are cohesive not in themselves but indirectly, by virtue of their specific meanings; they are not primarily devices for reaching out into thc preccding (or following) text, but they cxpress certain meanings which prcsuppose thc presence of other components in the discoursc.

Where is conjunction located, within the total framework of textforming relations? Instances of rcference,substitution and cllipsis arc, on the wholc, rather clearly idcntifiable, perhaps unusually so for linguistic phenomena; thcrc is some indeterminacy among them, and also between them and other structural rclations within a text, but this is rela\~ tively slight, and we have rarcly been in doubt as to thc boundaries of thc phenomena being described. This is much less truc of conjunction, which is not definable in such clearcut terms.Pcrhaps the most strictly cohcsive relation is that of substitution,including ellipsis.Substitution is a purely textual relation, with no other function than that of cohering one piece of text to another. The substitutc, or elliptical structurc, signals in effect supply thc appropriatc word or words already available'it is a grammatical relation, one which holds between the words and structures thcmselvcs rather than rclating them through thcir meanings.Next in this ordcr comes refcrence,which is a scmantic relation, onc which holds between meanings rather than bctween linguistic forms; it is not the replacement of some linguistic element by a counter or by a blank, as are substitution and ellipsis, but rather a direction for intcrpreting an clement in tcrms of its cnvironment-and since thc cnvironment includes the text (thc linguistic environment), rcference takes on a cohesive function.A referencc item signals 'supply the appropriatc instantial meaning, thc referent in this instancc, which is already available or shortly to become available) and one source of its availability is thc preccding (or following text.With conjunction, on the other hand, we move into a different type of semantic relation, onc which is no longer any kind of a search instruction,but a specification of the way in which what is to follow is systematically connected to what has gone before.

In a scnse this is putting it rather too concretely. Thc conjunctive relations themselves are not ticd to any particular sequencc in thc cxpression; if two sentences cohere into a text by virtue of some forn of conjunction, this does not mean that the relation betwccn thcm could subsist only if they occur in that particular order.This is true cven of a conjunctive relation which is itself intrinsically ordcred, such as succession in time; two sentences may bc linked by a time relation, but thc sentence referring to thc event that is earlicr in time may itsclf come later, following thc othcr sentence. When wc are considering these sentences specifically from thc point of view of cohcsion, howcver, wc are inevitably concerncd with their actual sequcnce as expressed, becausc cohesion is the rclation bctwecn sentenccs in a tcxt, and the sentences of a text can only follow one after the other. Hence in describing conjunction as a cohesive devicc, we are focusing attention not on the semantic relations as such, as realized throughout the grammar of thc language, but on onc particular aspect of them,namely the function they have of relating to cach other linguistic elcments that occur in succession but arc not rclated by other, structural means.

# 5.1.1.Structural equivalents of conjunctive relations

There is a range of different structural guises in which thc relations that we are here calling ConJun crIv e niay appear. These relations constitute a highly generalizcd component within the scmantic systcm, with reflexes spread throughout thc language,taking various forms; and thcir cohesive potential derives from this source. Because they represent vcry general rclations that may be associated with different threads of meaning at different places in the fabric of languagc, it follows that when they are expressed on their own, unaccompanied by othcr cxplicit connecting factors, they have a highly cohesive effect.

Let us take as an example thc relation already nentioned abovc, that of succession in timc.This appcars in many diffcrent rcalizations, according to the other scmantic pattcrns with which it is associated. It may, first of all be embodied in a prcdication as in [s:iahere the verb follow means'occur subsequently in time'Notc that the same relation can be cxpressed,still as a predication but with the tcrms reversed,by making the verb passive, or using a different verb precede. Secondly,the relation of succession in time can bc cxpressed as a minor prcdication; that is,it may bc realizcd prepositionally, as in [5:rb].Again the rclationship could be viewed from cither dircction, with before instead of after.

Thirdly, time sequence may be cxpressed as a rclationship bctwcen predications, with onc clause being shown as depcndcnt on anothcr by means of a conjunction as in [s:ic];sometimes, but not in all instanccs, the same words may occur both as conjunction and as preposition. Finally, in [s:id], we have two separate sentences.Hcre there is no structural rclationship at all; but the two parts are still linked by the same logical relations of succession in tine.

[5:1] a. A snowstorm followed the battle.The battle was followed by asnowstorm.) b.After the battle, there was a snowstorm. c.After they had fought a battle,it snowed. d.They fought a battle.Afterwards, it snowed.

Contrast the following:

[51]a.A snowstorm preceded the battle. b'. Before the battle, there had bccn a snowstorm. c'.Before they fought a battle,it had snowed. d.They fought a battle.Previously, it had snowed.

In d) and(d),the relation of sequence in timc is expressed by an adverb, functioning as Adjunct, and occurring initially in thc sccond sentencc. Here thc time relation is now thc only explicit form of connection bctween the two cvents, which in thc other examples are linked also by various structural rclationships.The time sequence has now become a cohesive agent, and it is this, the semantic relation in its cohesive function, that we are referring to as conJunction.The Adjunct will bc referred to aS a CONJUNCTIVE, CONJUNCTIVE ADJUNCI Or DISCOURSE ADJUNCT.

It is not always possible to find a complete set of structurcs on the above model to express cach onc of thc set of relations we arc interested in, especially if wc takc account of all thcir subcategorics.But this examplc is not untypical, and there will always bc some form of alternative rcalization whcreby thc relations that figure as conjunctive, in the formation of text, can also bc systcmatically enbodied in various typcs of structurc.The significance of this fact is that it allows us to recognize that, although for cxamplc in [5:1d] thc cohesion is achieved through the conjunctive expression afterwards, it is the undcrlying semantic relation of succcssion in time that actually has the cohcsive power. This cxplains how it is that we arc often prepared to recognize the prcsence of a relation of this kind even whcn it is not expressed overtly at all. Wc arc prepared to supply it for oursclves, and thus to assumc that there is cohcsion even though it has not been explicitly demonstrated.

Here is another cxample, this time of the rclation of ApversiTy:

[5:2] b.He fell aslccp, in spite of his great discomfort. c. Although he was very uncomfortablc, he fell asleep. d. He was very uncomfortable. Nevertheless he fell asleep.

It is not obvious whcther there is an example corresponding to [s:1a], but perhaps

[5:2] a. His grcat discomfort did not prevent him from falling asleep might be accepted as equivalent. On the other hand, here wc could certainly add others, with the discomfort being expressed in a non-finite clausc:

[5:2] e. Despite being very uncomfortable, he fellasieep. f.Being vcry uncomfortable, he still fell asleep.

Thc scmantic relationship remains an adversative one throughout

Not only does the scmantic relation remain thc same; so do thc elenents rclatcd by it. In [s:1] the two phenomena that are related by succcssion in time are both processes, and they rcnain so throughout, evcn though both of them, the fighting and thc snowing, appcar now as verbs and now as nouns. In [5:2], one is a proccss and thc other a state; again they remain constant though appearing in differcnt grammatical forms. This in turn strengthens still further the cohesive potential of the rclation in question. The speaker of the languagc rccognizes that the same phenomenon may appear in different structural shapes and sizes; and he is awarc that certain types of phenomena arc likcly to be linked to one another by certain typcs of meaning relation.

There is one furthcr form of exprcssion to bc considered.We night have

[5:1] g.They fought a battle.After that, it snowed.

[5:2 g.He was vcry uncomfortable.Dcspite this, hc fell aslccp.

Here we havc, in each casc, two scntences, so the link bctween them is cohesive, as in d) and not structural. But the cohesion is providcd by the refercncc itcms this and that. Thc words after and despite, taken on their own,express thc relations of time scquence and advcrsity,as in [s:1b] and [5:2b]; but it is only through their structural association with this and that that thcy servc a cohesive function in the given instancc. It is thc reference items that rclate the second sentcnce to the preceding onc.

# 5.1.2 Types of conjunctive expression

With any of the conjunctive relations in question, provided therc is a preposition to cxpress it this preposition can always be madc to govern a refcrence item; the resulting prepositional group will then function as a cohesive Adjunct. It is a moot point whcther such instances should be treated as conjunction or as rcference.Strictly speaking,thcy belong with reference, because they depend on the presencc of a referencc item following the prcposition.But since they involve rclations which also function cohesively when cxpressed wihour the accompaniment of rcference items,it is simpler to include them within the gencral heading of conjunction.Besides this, there arc a numbcr of what are now conjunctive adverbs which, although not made up of a preposition plus a reference item in the contemporary language, have thcir origin in this construction at an earlicr stage: words like therefore and thereby (and compare thosc bascd on the WH-form likc whereupon whereat.We no longcr feel that thcsc have a demonstrative in them, and this suggests that even in analytic forms such as after that we rcspond to the cohesivc force of thc phrase as a wholc rathcr than singling out that as an anaphoric clcment on its own.

Furthermore many conjunctive cxpressions occur in two more or less synonymous forms, one with and the other without a demonstrative. These are the oncs which have the samc form both as preposition and as advcrb, corresponding to [s:id and g],respectivcly; or, more accurately sincc many are not advcrbs but prepositional phrases, like as d result),which occur as Adjunct, either alone or followed by a prcposition, usually ofplus thisthatfor cxamplc insteadof thatas a result of that)in consequence (of that).It would sem rathcr artificial to suggest that as a result and as a result of that reprcsent two quitc different types of cohesion. So we shall assumc that both of them are to bc includcd undcr the heading of conjunction, thc criterion being that already adopted, or implicd: given a particular semantic relation which cAN operate conjunctively (ie which takes on a cohesive function when exprcsscd on its own), then any expression of that relation, with or without a demonstrative or other refercnce itcm, will be considcrcd to fall within the category of conjunction. In gcncral, thereforc, conjunctive adjuncts will bc of three kinds:

1 adverbs, including: simplc adverbs coordinating conjunctions)eg:but,so,then,next compound adverbs in -lyegaccordinglysubsequentlyactually compound adverbs in there- and where-,eg: therefore, thereupon, whereat   
2) othcr compound adverbs, eg furthermore, nevertheless,anyway, instead,besides prcpositional phrases, eg: on the contrary as a result in addition   
3) prepositional expressions with that or other reference item, the latter bcingi optional egas a result of that instead of thatin addition to that or (i obligatory,eg: in spite of that because of that.

The refcrence item, in (3)is not nccessarily a demonstrative functioning on its own as Head;there may bc a nominal group with noun Head, the demonstrative or other reference item functioning as Dcictic. In order for the total expression to bc conjunctivc, any form of rcference will serve provided it is anaphoric. In $\left[ s : 3 \right]$ the cxpression as a result of his enquiries is not conjunctive, since the referencc item his is cataphoric to the Inspector:

[5: 3] Joncs had been missing for fivc weeks. As a result of his enquiries, the Inspector was convinced he had left the country.

All the following examples, however, do exhibit cohesion, thc cxpressions beginning with as a result all being conjunctive adjuncts:

[5:4] The captain had steered a course close in to the shore

a.As a rcsult,   
b.As a result of this, they avoided the worst of the c.As a result of this move, storm.   
d.As a result of his caution

If, on thc othcr hand, thc second sentcnce had been

[5:4] c. Thcy were heartily thankful for his caution. it would still have bccn cohesive but not by conjunction.Thc cohesion would be achicved by rcference,through the word his: thcre is no conjunctive element(for his caution is spccifically dependent on thankful, which dctermines the preposition for).The mcaning is not as a result, they were heartily thankful'but rather they applaudcd his caution'As always,the line between specific instances will be hard to draw in practice; therc will be borderline cases, such as

# [5:4] f.For his caution hc was highly commended.

In thc last resort it docs not mattcr,since the effcct is cohcsive anyway;but a speaker of English is probably aware here of two rathcr different kinds of tcxture, even though in somc instances he may recognize that hc is faced with a mixture of thc two.

If the conjunctive is a prcpositional expression, such as because of this, it will often bc possible to find an adverb that is roughly equivalent in meaning (eg: therefore). This is becausc conjunctions express onc or othcr of a small number of very general rclations, and it is the conjunctive relation rather than the particular nominal Complement following the preposition that provides the relevant link to the preceding sentcnce.This Complement, as we have secn, is frcquently a purely anaphoric one,typ1- cally a demonstrative, this or that orif it is a nounit is quite likcly to be a general noun of the typc describcd in 6.1 bclow; f: move in [5:4c] above), which does no morc than make explicit the anaphoric function of the wholc phrase.

A conjunctive adjunct normally has first position in the scntence (some exceptions are noted below),and has as its domain the whole of the sentencc in which it occurs: that is to say, its meaning extcnds over the entire scntence, unless it is repudiated.However, as evidenced by the indeterminacy, or perhaps fexibility, of our punctuation systcm, the sentence itsclf is a very indetcrminatc catcgory, and it is very common to find conjunctive adjuncts occurring in written English following a colon or semicolon. In terms of our dcfinition of cohcsion if we take the orthographic scntence strictly as it stands, such instances would not bc cohesive, since cohesion is a relation bctwcen sentences,not a relation within the sentcnce.But thc conjunction has the cffect of rcpudiatingthat is,of sctting a limit to thc domain of-any other conjunction that has occurred previously in sentencc-initial position.So for cxample in

[5:s] So Alice picked him up very gently and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the Queen that she mightn't take his breath away:but,before she put him on the table, shc thought she might as well dust him a littlc, he was so covered in ashes.

the but following the colon presupposcs the first part of the sentence; it thercforc cancels out the so at the bcginning, defining thc limit of its domain. It would bc cqually possiblc, and with very little differcnce in meaning,to start a ncw sentence at but.

In considering spokcn English, we can define the sentence in such a way that this problem docs not arise: if we say that a ncw sentcnce starts whcnevcr there is no structural conncction with what has gone beforc, thcn in all such instances there will be a sentencc boundary before thc conjunction, and thc gcneral principle stated above (that a conjunction occurs in first position and has the whole sentencc as its domain will rcmain valid.But it would be arbitrary to impose this definition on written English, which has its own conventions, including that whereby thc notion of a sentencc (as written, ie extending from capital letter to full stop) is not bound by structural considerations,but takes in other factors as well -being exploited particularly by many writcrs to reflect pattcrns of intonation. Hencc we have to rccognize that in many instances thcre will be a conjunctive expression in the middle of a sentence,presupposing a previous clause in the same sentence.We saw earlicr that there can be instances of anaphoric reference and substitution whcre the presupposed item is also to bc found within thc same sentence as thc anaphoric onc; here too,although for different rcasons, elements that create texture by bringing about cohesion between sentences also reinforce the internal texture that exists within the sentence itself.

# 5.2 Some common conjunctive elements

# 5.2.1 The andrelation

The simplest form of conjunction is and'.

Strictly speaking the two elementary logical relations of 'and'and or'are structural rather than conjunctive. That is to say, thcy arc incorporated into linguistic structure,being realized in the form of a particular structural relation, that of coorDinArion. Coordination is a structurc of thc paratactic type (see 4.4.5 above).The and' relation is felt to be structural and not cohesive, at least by mature speakers; this is why we fecl a little uncomfortablc at finding a sentence in written English beginning with And, and why wc tend not to consider that a child's composition having and as its dominant sentence linker can really be said to form a cohesive whole.

However, it is a fact that thc word and is used cohesively, to link one sentence to another, and not only by children f s.5 below).Thc and relation has to be included among thc scmantic rclations entering into thc general category of conjunction.What distinguishcs the two is that, in its clementary logical form, this relation is cxpressed through the medium of linguistic structurc. The word and is thc markcr of this structural relation. It is not an Adjunct in fact it has no status as a constitucnt at all. It is merely a structure signal.

Thc coordination relation which is reprcscnted by the word and may obtain betwcen pairs or among scts of itcms functioning morc or less anywhere in the structurc of the language.Thcy may be nouns, or nominal groups; verbs, or verbal groups; adverbs, or adverbial or prepositional groups; or they may be clauses. A pair or a set of items which are joined by coordination functions as a singlc compLEx clement of structure:as noun complcx,nominal group complex, verbal group complcx,clause complex, and so on.Thcy function in thc same way as the cquivalent sIMplE elemcnts:that is to say,a nominal group complex,for example, functions in the structure of the clausc in cxactly thc same way as does a nominal group.

Compared with its scope as a structure, thc scope of thc and relation as a form of conjunction is somcwhat modificd and extendcd. We shall refer to thc conjunctive and'by the more gencra term ADDitivE,to suggest somcthing rather looser and less structural than is meant by cOORDINATE. Thus thc coordinatc rclation is structural, whercas the additivc relation is cohesive.The additive is a generalized semantic relation in the text-forming component of thc scmantic systcm, that is based on the logical notion of'and'; and it is one of a small sct of four such relations that we arc grouping together under the heading of conjunction.

When thc'and'rclation operates conjunctively,between sentcnces, to give cohesion to a text - or rather to crcatc text, by cohering one sentence to another -it is restricted to just a pair of sentenccs.This providcs an indication of the difference bctween 'and'as a structural relation coordinate and 'and'as a cohesive relation additive).A coordinate itcm such as men and wonen functions as a single whole; it constitutcs a singlc element in the structure of a largcr unit, for example Subject in a clausc. There is no reason why this potentiality should be limited to two items we may havc three, as in menwomen and children, or even more.And if we have morc than two,we may,or may not, structure them further by introducing layering, as in men and women, and boys and girls, which is men and women and boys and girls)).There is no fixed limit cither to the depth or to the extent of coordinate structures.

With and'as a conjunctivc rclation, on thc other hand, thc situation is quite different.Here the rclation is bctwccn scntences, and sentences follow one anothcr one at a time as the tcxt unfolds; thcy cannot be rearranged, as a coordinate structure can, in differcnt sequences and different bracketings,eg: women and men, or men and boys, and women and girls. So therc is no question of linking a whole set of sentences together by a single 'and' relation. Each new sentcnce either is or is not linkcd to its predeccssor, as an independent fact; and if it is, and(the additive relation) is onc way in which it may be so linked. For cxample,

[5:6] I wonder if all thc things movc along with us?thought poor puzzled Alicc. And the Quecn seemed to guess her thoughts, for she cried FasterDon't try to talk!'

Thc ncxt sentence, in turn, might also be linked by and'type cohesion: but if it is, it will simply be linked on to thc sccond one. The thrce will not form a single whole. If they had done, it would have been possible to omit the and betwcen all but thc last pair, as in a coordinate scrics like men, women and children. Sets of scntences of this kind do in fact occur, under certain circumstanccs: particularly if thcy are closely parallel in structure and mcaning.But in such cases thcy are not really interprctable as separatc scntcnces. Thc following cxample, although punctuated as sentenccs, is rcally morc likc a set of coordinate clauses:

[5:7] At the end of three yards I shall repeat then - for fcar of your forgetting them. At the end of four, I shall say goodbye. And at the end of five, I shall go!'

# 5.2.2 Coordinate and and conjunctive and

The typical context for a conjunctive and is one in which there is a total, or almost total, shift in the participants from onc sentence to thc next, and yet the two sentences are very definitely part of a text.For cxamplc [5:8] He hcaved the rock aside with all his strength. And thcrc in thc recesses of a deep hollow lay a glittering hcap of treasure.

In narrative fiction such a shift occurs charactcristically at thc boundary of dialoguc and narrative:

[5:9] Whilc you're refreshing yourself,said thc Queen I'll just take thc mcasurements' And she took a ribbon out of her pocket, marked in inches...

A slightly differcnt use, and one in which the cohesivc and comcs perhaps closcst to the structural function it has in coordination, is that which indicates next in a serics (of things to be said).This is thc INrERNAL sense described in 5.3 bclow.Herc it very often links a scrics of questions, meaning the next thing I want to know is...Thcre is an excellent cxample of this in Alice's interrogation of Humpty Dumpty concerning thc mcaning of Jabberwocky;it is too long to quote in full, but thc following cxtract will show the pattern:

[5:10] I scc it now,Alice remarked thoughtfully:and what arc "toves" Well,"tovesarc something like badgers-thcy'rc something like lizards- and thcy're something likc corkscrews. They must be very curious creatures.' They are that'said Humpty Dumpty:'also they make their nests undcr sun-dials-also they live on cheese. And what's to"gyre"and to gimble"? To "gyre is to go round and round like a gyroscope.To "gimble is to make holes like a gimlct. And the wabe is the grass plot round a sun-dial, I suppose? said Alice, surpriscd at her own ingcnuity.

Or it links a series of points all contributing to onc gcncral argument. In this function and'pcrhaps carrics over some of thc RETROspECTIVE effcct that it has as a coordinator, as in men, women and children.

This rctrospectivc function is in fact rather significant. Perhaps rctrojcctive'might bc a better word for it, suggesting the appropriate sensc of projecting backwards) In a scrics such as menwonen and childrenor TomDick and Harry, the mcaning of and is projected backwards so that wc interpret as mcn and women and childrenTom and Dick and Harry'(Sincc much usc is being madc in this section of the distinction bctwccn italics and quotation marks,it may bc helpful to give a reminder: a word, or longer piccc,that is in italics indicates awordingan item of the language; onc in quotation marks indicatcs a mcaning.) This phenomenon of projecting backwards occurs only with the two elcmentary logical relations of and'and 'orwhich are the only ones cxpressed in the form of coordination; parallel to ToDick and Harry we havc TomDick or Harry whcre thc'or'is also projected backwards, giving thc mcaning 'Ton or Dick or Harry.Thc phenomenon is not limited to strings of words, but is common to all coordinate structures, for cxample a serics such as the following:

[5:11] Thc balls were live hedgchogs, the mallcts live flaningocs, and thc soldicrs had to double themselves up and to stand upon their hands and fcct, to make the arches.

Summarizing, the logical and' and or relations differ from the wider sct of textual rclations that cnter into cohesion, in the following ways:

(1 Thcy are cxpresscd structurally, in thc form of coordination.   
2)They are retrospective, in the sense just explaincd.   
(3They have correlative forms both ... and and either ...or.   
(4) They have a negative form nor $\circeq$ and not),together with its correlative neither...nor $=$ both not...and not.

# 5.2.3 Other conjuncrive elenents: but yct, so and thcn

The retrospective power of and provides a useful insight into the meaning of certain other words especially but. Thc word but expresses a relation which is not additive but ADveRsArive.However, in addition to thc meaning adversative but contains within itself also the logical meaning ofand it is a sort of portmanteau, or shorthand form, of and however. The evidencc for this is the fact that but is also rctrospectivc -but thc meaning which it projccts in this way is not but'but and.Consider the example

[5:12] The cldest son worked on thc farm, the second son worked in the blacksmith's shop, but thc youngest son left home to seek his fortune.

This has to be interpreted as thc eldest son worked on the farm and the second...Thc fact that but contains'and'is the reason why we cannot say and but although wc can say and yet and soand thenetc.It also cxplains why the construction Although .but ..so frequently used by nonnative speakers of English, is wrong: a structure cannot be both hypotactic and coordinatc (paratactic) at the same timc.

The words yet, so and then do not normally project backwards in this way, although thcy can do in rarc instances. In general they do not include any componcnt of'and' instead they frequcntly combine with and, as mcntioned above. In fact, when the word and occurs at the beginning of a new sentence it is very often accompanicd by another conjunctive word or phrase, the two together functioning as a single element. Thc second conjunction may be one expressing a different textual rclation from thc and (such as the adversative yet)or it may itsclf also bc additivcso wc find not only and yet and soand then and anyway, but also and also,and furthermore, and in addition.

The different types of conjunctivc rclation that enter into cohesion are listed in the next section.They are not the samc as the elcmentary logical rclations that are cxpressed through the structural mcdium of coordination.Conjunction,in other words, is not simply coordination extcnded so as to operate betwcen sentences.As we saw in 5.1examples [5:1 and $[ s : 2 ] )$ at least some of the conjunctive relations have equivalents in very diffcrent types of structure, such as predication within thc clause and hypotaxis between clauses; these are quite unrelatcd to coordination. Thcrc arc other conjunctive rclations which are closcr to coordination in particular the ADDirive to which the closest parallel among thc structural relations is the coordinate and.But this is still not the samc thing; the additive relation is a complex one including components of emphasis which arc absent from the elementary'and'rclation.The same holds for the coordinatc rclation or'; there is a cohcsivc catcgory related toorexpressed by conjunctions such as instead, but it is also a mixture, with other elements present in it. Thc conjunctive relations are not logical but textual; thcy represent the gencralized types of connection that we recognize as holding bctween sentences. What these connections are depcnds in the last resort on the meanings that sentences cxpress, and essentially these are of two kinds: experiential, reprcsenting thc linguistic interpretation of experience, and intcrpersonal, represcnting participation in the speech situation.In the remaining scctions of this chapter we attcmpt to outline the various types of conjunction, with some typical examplcs of cach.

# 5.3Types of conjunction

Various suggestions could be taken up for classifying the phenomcna which we are grouping togcther under the heading of conJuncrIOn. There is no single, uniqucly correct inventory of the types of conjunctive rclation; different classifications are possible, each of which would highlight diffcrent aspects of the facts.

Wc shall adopt a scheme of just four catcgorics:additive adversative, causal, and temporal.Herc is an example of each:

[5:13] For the whole day hc climbed up the stecp mountainside, almost without stopping. a.And in all this time hc met no one. (additive)

b. Yet hc was hardly aware of bcing tired. (adversative) c.So by night time the valley was far bclow him. (causal) d.Thcn, as dusk fell, he sat down to rest. (temporal)

Thc words and yet, so and then can be taken as typifying thesc four very general conjunctivc relations, which they express in their simplest form.

Naturally if wc reduce the many very varicd kinds of conjunction to this small number of basic typcs, there is scope for a considcrable amount of subclassifying within them. A very simple overall framework like this docs not ELIMINAE thc complexity of the facts;it relegates it to a later, or more delicatc stage of thc analysis.Our reason for prcferring this framcwork is just that: it seems to have the right prioriticsmaking it possible to handle a text without unnecessary complication. A detailed systematization of all the possiblc subclasses would be more complex than is needed for the understanding and analysis of cohesion; morcover, they are quite indeterminatc, so that it would be difficult to sclcct one version in prefcrence to another. We shall introduce some subclassification under cach of the four hcadings, but not of any vcry rigid kind.

There is one very general distinction, common to all four typcs, which it will be helpful to make at thc start. Consider the following pair of examples:

[5:14] a.Next he inserted the kcy into the lock. b.Next, he was incapable of inserting the kcy into the lock.

Each of thesc scntences can be seen, by virtue of the word next, to presupposc some preceding sentence, somc textual environment. Morcover in cach case there is a relation of tcmporal sequence between thc presupposed sentencc and this one; both [5:14a and b] express a relation that is in some sense next in time.We shall in fact classify thcm both as TEMPORAL.But the nextness is really rather different in the two instances. In a)it is a relation bctween cvcnts: the prcceding sentence might bc First he switched on the light - first onc thing happens,then another. The timc scqucnce, in other words, is in thc rhesis, in the content of what is bcing said. In (b). on the other hand, the preceding sentence might be First he was unahle to stand upright here there are no cvents; or rather, there are only Lincuistic evcnts, and the timc sequcncc is in thc spcaker's organization of his discourse. We could say the timc scqucnce is in the ARGumeNt, provided argument is understood in its cvcryday rhctorical sense and not in its technical sense in logic contrasting with operator).The two sentcnces arc related as steps in an argument, and the meaning is rathcr first one move in the speech gamc is cnacted, then another'.

It would be possiblc to describe the nature of the temporal relation in [5:14b] in terns of spccch acts, the time sequence being a perfornative sequencc first I say onc thing,thcn anothcr'.This is quitc adequate for the particular examplc, but is too concrctc for this typc of conjunction as a wholc. As later examples will show, what we arc conccrned with here is not so much a rclationship between speech acts though it may take this form,cspecially in thc tcmporal setting) as a relationship between different stages in the unfolding of the speaker's cOMMuNIcATION ROLE-the meanings he allots to himself as a participant in the total situation. Thc distinction bctween (a) and (b) really relatcs to the basic.functional components in thc organization of language.In [5:14a] the cohesion has to be interprcted in terms of the Ex PeRIENtIAL function of language; it is a relation betwccn mcanings in the sense of representations of contents, our experiencc of) cxternal reality.In [s:14b] the cohesion has to be interpreted in tcrms of the INTeRPERsONAL function of language; it is a rclation between mcanings in the sense of reprcsentations of thc speaker's ownstamp on thc situation-his choice of speech role and rhetorical channel, his attitudes, his judgments and the like.

The essential fact here is that communication is itsclf a proccss, albeit a process of a special kind; and that the salicnt cvent in this process is the text. It is this that makes it possible for therc to bc two closely analogous scts of conjunctive relations:those which exist as rclations bctween external phenomena, and those which are as it were internal to thc communication situation.The clcarest instance is to be found in thc rclation of temporal scqucnce, as just illustrated:it is fairly obvious that temporal sequence is a property both of the proccsses that arc encoded in language and of.the process of linguistic interaction itself. At the samc time, the two time scquences are also clearly on diffcrent planes of reality, which explains why it is that certain apparently contradictory elements can combine with each other; we may have an example like

[5:15] Next, previously to this he had alrcady offered to resign.

meaning and after this (in internalor situation time I shall tll you what happened before this (in external or thesis time)The analogy in the other typcs of conjunctive relation, additive, adversative and causal, is somcwhat less cxact;but it is still exact enough for nany of thc same conjunctive cxpressions to be used in both meanings, for example:

[5:16] a. Shc was never really happy here. So she's leaving. b.Shc'll be bettcr off in a new placc.-So she's leaving?

In a thcre is a causal relation between two cvents -or two phenomena, let us say, since the first is a state rathcr than an cvent.The meaning is bccausc she was not happy, she's Icaving.In b) there is also a causal relation, but it is within the communication process;the mcaning is becausc you refer to hcr being about to bc in a new place, I conclude she's lcaving'This is a very typical cxamplc of the sort of parallelism we find between thc two planes of conjunctivc relations, the extcrnal and the internal.

No pair of terms sccms quitc right for referring to this distinction in a way that is succinct yet still transparent.We might use objective' and subjectivc'; but these arc misleading,because the logical relations within the speech situation arc no more subjective than thosc within the thcsis or content of what is being said-the communication process itself is as objective as any of the processes that are being talkcd about. Most appropriate would be a pair of terms rclating to thc functional components of meaning (experiential and intcrpersonal; $c f$ Hymes''referential' and 'socio-expressiveLyons'cognitive' and social),since thc distinction in fact derives from the functional organization of the linguistic system; but these become cumbersome and require a constant effort of interpretation.For want of better,we shall use ExTERNAL and INTERNAL; they are somewhat vague,but preferable to more specific tcrms which might be suitable, say, in the setting of a temporal relation but not in a causal or adversative one. This is exactly the emphasis wc want to avoid. The value of the distinction we are drawing is precisely that it is gcneral to all the different relations that entcr into conjunction. When we use conjunction as a means of creating text, wc may cxploit cithcr thc rclations that arc inhcrent in thc phcnomena that language is used to talk about,or those that are inhcrent in the communication process, in thc forms of interaction bctwecn spcakcr and hcarer; and these two possibilitics are the same whatcver thc type of conjunctive rclation, whethcr additive, adversative, tcmporal or causal. In fact we usually cxploit both kinds. The line between the two is by no means always clcarcut;but it is there, and forms an essential part of the total picture.

Each of the remaining subcategories that we shall set up for the present discussion is specific to onc or other of the four types of rclation, and will be brought up in the appropriate section. In the following table we set out the fOur headingS, ADDITIVE,ADVERSATIVE CAUSAL and

TEMpoRAL,and list examples of thc words and phrases that cxpress thesc mcanings. Thc distinction bctween extcrnal and internal, in thc scnse abovc, is also built into thc tablc; it will be noted that many though not all of thc conjunctions occur in both types of relation like next and so in [5:14]and [5:16].In one or two instances the same word occurs in more than one conjunctive type;eg:then is both temporal and causal.Somc labels arc given to the subcategories,where it is felt that these would be helpful; and thc classification of each type is rcpcatcd in the form of a list at the cnd of the section in which it is discussed.

# 5.4 Additive

We have already discussed (in 5.2) thc and'relation as it is cmbodicd in the form of coordination, and suggested that the cohesive rclation cxpressed by And at the bcginning of a new sentence -thc ADDiriVE relation - is somewhat different from coordination proper, although it is no doubt derivable from it.

It is not being claimed, of course, that cvcry timc a writer puts a full stop beforc and he is thcreby at once using thc word in a different sense. The distinction is neithcr as clearcut nor as consistent as this; and in any case the claim would be meaningless for spoken English for which it would be necessary to adopt and adherc to a particular explicit definition of the sentence.But equally thc notion of sentencc, vague though it is, is not invalid; we can definc the scntcnce for spoken English if wc want to. Probably the simplest definition is that a sentence equals a clausc complex: that is, any set of clauses that are hypotactically and/or paratactically rclated, with the simple clausc as the limiting case.Moreover thcre is a differcnce in principle betwecn structural relations, which hold within a scntence, and cohesive rclations, which hold within or) between sentences.

When we arc considering cohesive relations, wc can group together under the heading of additive both of the two types that appear structurally in the form of coordination, the and type and the or'type.The distinction between these two is not of primary significance for purposes of textual cohesion; and in any casc it is not the same distinction as that which is found betwecn them in coordination. The words and, or and nor are all uscd cohcsively, as conjunctions; and all of them are classified here as additive. The corrclative pairs both . .. and, either .. . or and neither .. nor do not in gcneral occur with cohesive function; they arc restricted to structural coordination within the sentence.This is because a coordinatc pair functions as a singlc unit, in some highcr structure, and so can be delineated as a constitucnt; whereas a cohesive pair'is not a pair at all, but a succession of two independent clements the second of which happens to be tied on to the first f the discussion on example [5:6] above).

All three, and or and nor, may express either thc ExTeRnAl or thc INTERNAL type of conjunctive rclation as these wcre dcscribed in 53 above).In the additivc context, in fact, there may bc no very clcar diffcrcncc between the two;but whcn and is used alone as a cohesivc itcm, as distinct from and then, ctc, it often seems to have the sense of 'thcrc is something more to be said, which is clearly internal in our tcrms, a kind of seam in thc discoursc. For example in [5:17a and b] the and has this sense:

[517] a....I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into the snow! And you'd have deserved it.. b.'I said you looked like an egg, sir, Alicc gently explained. And some cggs are very pretty, you know, she added..

Much of the discussion of and in 5.2 above illustrates thc same point examples [5:8-10] show differcnt kinds of internal and - linking a series of questionslike [5:18]:

[5:18] Was she in a shop?And was that really -was it really a sheep that was sitting on thc othcr side of the counter?

or linking dialogue and narrative, like [5: 19]:

[5:19].Who in the world am I?Ah, that's the great puzzleAnd she began thinking over all the children she kncw that werc of the same age as herself, to sce if she could have bcen changed for any of them.

Example [5:8] is perhaps on thc borderline; here and does link two different facts, which makes it external, but at the same time it may serve to convey the speaker's intention that they should be regarded as connected in some way.

The NeGA rive form of thc additive relation is exprcssed simply as nor as in Nor can I. Bcsides nor there are various other compositc expressions with more or Icss thc same meaning (f: or else as expansion of oras in5:24 belowand.notnot..either and...not...either and the forms neither, and ...neither.Here is an cxample with a clearly extcrnal sense the form bcing and...not...either

[5:20] I couldnt send all the horses, you know bccausc two of them are wanted in thc gamc. And I havcn't sent the two Mcsscngers cither.

It is likcly that the cxpanded forms with either have an additional element of explicitness in them, a sense ofand what is more'.This, in our terms, would be an element of internal meaning,since it is an exprcssion of the speaker's attitudc to or cvaluation of what hc is saying.Example [5:20] would in this sense perhaps be a combination of both external and internal conjunction. There are parallel forms of the positive 'and' relationnamely and alsoand...too:

[5:2r'To be able to see NobodyAnd at that distancc,too!'

Thcre are specifically EmpHATic forms of thc 'and'relation occurring only in an internal scnsc, that of'there is yet another point to be taken in conjunction with thc previous one'This in fact is essentially thc meaning that is taken on by the 'and'relation when it is a form of internal conjunction.There are a large number of conjunctive expressions which have just this mcaning,egfurtherfurthernore,againalsomoreover,what is more, besides, additionally in addition, in addition to this, not only that but. These give a definite rhctorical flavour, as in

[5:22] My client says hc does not know this witness.Further, he denics ever having seen her or spoken to her.

The speaker wants the two sentences to be as it were added together and reacted to in thcir totality

With the 'or' relation, the distinction betwccn the external and the internal plancs is perhaps morc clcarcut. The basic meaning of the conjunctive or'rclation is ALTERNATive. In its cxternal sensc, the offcring of a rangc of objective alternatives,or, togethcr with its expansion or else,is largely confincd to questions, requests, permissions and predictions(realized in the grammar as interrogative, imperative and modalized clauses).Even here the alternative could often be regarded as comprising a single sentence,as in

[5:23] Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille the Gryphon went on.Or would you like thc Mock Turtle to sing you a song?'

If it is associated with statements, or takes on thc internal scnse of an alternativc interprctationanothcr possible opinion,cxplanation,ctc in place of thc one just given':

[5:24] Perhaps shc missed her train. Or elsc shc's changed hcr mind and isn't coming.

Thc form or alternatively is perhaps an emphatic variant of thc or' relation, whcrcby the speaker stresses thc alternativeness, in the same way that by using and) additionally he emphasizcs thc additionalness in thc 'and'rclation.

Under the heading ADDirive wc may include a related pattern, that of semantic simil A Rity in which thc source of cohesion is thc comparison of what is being said with what has gone bcforc.Forns such as sinilarlylikewise, in the same way are used by thc spcaker to assert that a point is being rcinforccd or a new one added to thc same effcct; the relevancc of the presupposing scntence is its similarity of import to the prcsupposed one. There may be a likeness in the event; the cohesive use of comparison does not excludc thc prcsence of an external component, as in [5:2sa].But essentially it is the similarity in thc context of the communication proccss that is being used with cohcsivc cffect. [s:25b] brings out this internal aspcct.

[5:25 a. Treating people as rcsponsible citizens brings out the best in them;they behave as such. In the same way if you treat them as criminals they will soon begin to act like criminals. b.Your dircctors are planning for steady growth ovcr a considcrablc pcriod of time. Similarly our intentions in adopting this new investment policy arc focused on the long-tcrn prospects of thc company.

Corrcsponding to 'similarly'is the negative comparison where the meaning is DissiMIlARiry:'in contradistinction'. This is frequently expressed by thc phrase on the other hand; there are other forms such as by contrast, as opposed to this, and so on.

[5:26Our garden didn't do very wcll this year. By contrast, thc orchard is looking very healthy.

The phrase on the other hand is unusual among conjunctions in having a correlativc form, on the one hand;note however that when the two are used togethcr thc scnsc of dissimilaritytends to be weakencd, and thc effect is little morc than a simple additive:

[5:27 Why arent you going in for a swim?-On thc one hand, the air's too coldI likc to be warm whcn I come out.On the other hand, the current's too strong; I likc to be sure I sHALl come out.

Notc the similarity between comparison as a conjunctive relation especially in its external sensc,cxpressed by conjunctive Adjuncts of one kind and another, and comparison as a form of rcfcrcnce, expressed by Deictics, Epithets and Submodifiers (scc 2.2 and 2.5)

With negative comparison, wc arc approaching the ADveRsAtIVE type of conjunctive relation, whcrc it has the sense of'not...but.. that is, where the first term in thc comparison is denied in ordcr to make room for the sccond one.Hcrc wc find expressions such as instead,rather, on the contrary.These will bc brought up in the next section.Meanwhile there are two other types of rclation which can be thought of as subcategories of the additive.Both of these arc rcally relations on the internal planc-though, as always, thcy may havc cxtcrnal implications.

Thc first is that of ExPOSITION or EXEMPLIFICATION. This corrcsponds, structurally, not to coordination but to Apposition. Among the items which occur frequently in this function are, in thc cxpository senseI mean that isthat is to sayor in other words or to put it another wayin thc cxemplificatory sense for instance for example thus.Notc that the word or also occurs alone as a marker of structural apposition, thc sense being by another (alternative name'.Other items, such as namely and the abbreviations ie, viz, eg, are likewise usually uscd as structural markers within the sentcnce, although they may occasionally bc found linking two sentences. Examples:

[5:28] a. I wonder whethcr that statement can be backed up by adequate evidence.- In othcr words, you don't believc me. b.What sort of things do you remember best?Alicc ventured to ask.'Oh,things that happened the week aftcr nextthe Queen replied in a carcless tone.For instancc, now' shc went on...thcrc's thc King's Messenger. Hc's in prison now, being punished: and the trial doesn't evcn bcgin till next Wednesday: and of course the crime comes last of all. c. In the Index of Railroad Stations the names of many railroads are followed by small numerals. These are time-table numbers indicating the table in which a given station is shown in thc railroad's representation. For example, undcr Danbury, Ct.,is shown N.Y.New Hav.and H.12.This means Danbury is found on the time-table No.12 of that railroad.\*

Of these, (a) is cxpository,(b exemplifyingwhile $( c )$ contains an example ofeach: this means, and for example.

Finally thcre is a small sct of items such as incidentally,by the way, which combinc thc scnsc of additive with that of AFTERHouGIIr.They arc perhaps on thc bordcrlinc of cohesion; thcy may often hardly presupposc any preceding discoursc, although in principle onc sentcncc can bc incidental only by refcrcnce to a previous onc.

[5:29] You'll sec mc theresaid thc Cat and vanished...While she was looking at the placc where it had beenit suddenly appeared again. By-the-bye, what became of the baby'said thc Cat,I'd ncarly forgotten to ask.

This sort of aftcrthought is really a kind of DE-Emph Asis,reducing the weight accorded to the presupposing scntencc and to its connection with what went before; it thus contrasts with the enphatic type described earlicr, cxpressed by furthermore and similar forms.

Thc structural analoguc of the additive rclation-that is,its equivalent in thc form of a relation within thc scntence -is parataxis, including both coordination and apposition.To thc siMPLE ADDinIvE (including negative and alternative) forms correspond structurcs using the same words and, or and nor as well as thcir corrclative pairs both ..and etc.To the APposirroNAl type corresponds structural apposition, which may be cxpressed by mcans of markcrs such as namely, or, that is, or simply by juxtaposition;in spokcn English thcre must also be tonal concord -a pair of itcms in apposition always have the samc intonation pattern.On thc othcr hand, thc cOMPARATIVE and the variOus cOMPLEx relations that we have groupcd under thc heading of ADDirive have no equivalent as structural relations within thc sentence.

Here is a summary of the conjuncrive relations of the ADpinive typc, with examples of cach:

Simple additive rclations (cxtcrnal and internal) Additive: and;and alsoand...too Negative: norand...notnot...citherncither Alternative: oror else   
Complex additive rclations (internal) :cmphatic Additive: further(more),moreover, additionally, besides that add to this in addition and another thing Alternative: alternatively

# 5.5 Adversative

The basic mcaning of thc ADvERsA TIvE relation is contrary to cxpectation.Thc cxpectation may be derived from the content of what is being said, or from the communication proccss, thc speaker-hearer situation, so that here too.as in the additive, we find cohesion on both the extcrnal and the internal planes.

An ExTeRNAL adversative relation is expressed in its simple form by the word yet occurring initially in thc senten.ce:

[5:30] All the figures were correct; they'd been chcckcd. Yct the total came out wrong.

Vcry similar to yet in this function arc but, however, and though. It was suggcsted carlier (s.2 that but differs from yet in that but contains the elemcnt and'as one of its mcaning components, whereas yet docs not; for this reason,we regularly find sentences beginning and yet, but ncver and but.

The word however is different again.Unlike yet and but, however can occur non-initially in the sentence (in which case it can co-occur with initial and or but but not with yet);and it rcgularly occurs as a separate tone group-separate, that is, from what follows- and so is associated with intonational prominencc, whereas yet and but are normally spoken as reduced' syllables and become tonal only for purposes of contrast. Finally though as a conjunctive is always phonologically reduced; it may occur initially in which case it is indistinguishable in spccch from thc subordinating though $=$ althongh) and would be treatcd as cohesive only if occurring in writing after a full stop)but its normal position is as a tailpiece at the end of thc clausc.Some cxamples:

[5:31 a.All this timc Twccdledec was trying his bcst to fold up the umbrella,with hinsclf in it...But he couldn't quite succeed,

and it cndcd in his rolling over,bundled up in thc umbrella, with only his hcad out.   
b....it swept her straight off the seat, and down anong thc heap of rushes.However,she wasnt a bit hurt, and was soon up again.   
c.I likc thc Walrus bestsaid Alicc:bccausc you sce,he was a little sorry for the poor oysters. He ate more than thc Carpentcr though'said Tweedledee.

The following set of examplcs shows thc intonation patterns $\left( c f \varsigma . 9 \right)$ that are associatcd with howevercxamplc (a) is untypical for however but corresponds to thc typical use of but

[5:32] a.//4 However she was not going to let hersclf bc BEATEN b. $\ddot { / / \mathrm { ~ I ~ } }$ HOWEVER $\therefore 4$ she was not going to let Janc felt most herself be BEATEN $\it { 1 1 }$ dishcartened. C. $\ddot { / / 4 }$ Shc was not going to let hersclf bc BEATEN however $\ddot { / } \dot { / }$ d. $\%$ THIS time however $\ddot { / / \mathrm { ~ I ~ } }$ she was not going to let hersclf be BEATEN/

Thc pattcrn in c and d) would also bc appropriate to thongh

Thc adversative sense is exprcsscd by a number of other words and phrases.Thc word only occurs frequently in this sensc in spoken English, always in initial position and phonologically rcduccd, likc however in [5:32a]; $e g$

[5:33] I'd love to join in. Only I don't know how to play.

Other advcrsative words such as nevertheless and still, and prepositional expressions such as in spite of this, are on thc othcr hand usually fully accented,and often also tonic, like however in [5:32b]cg

[5:34] It certainly was a very large Gnat:about the size of a chicken Alice thought. Still,she couldn't feel nervous with it, after thcy had becn talking together so long.

In some instances the advcrsative rclation between two sentences appears as it wcre with the sequence rcversed, where the second sentence and not the first would correspond to thc although clause in a hypotactic structure.Hcre the normal cohesive form is yet;we also find and in advcrsative use in this sensc:

[5:35] a. The total came out wrong.Yct all the figurcs were correct; they'd been checked.

cfThe total came out wrongalthough all the figures were correct.

[5:35] b.DeardearHow queer everything is today!And yesterday things went on just as usual.'

At the same time, but and however occur in a related though somewhat different sense, which we might call contRA stive.This thcy share with on the other hand but nevcr in its correlative form on the one hand..on the other hand, which is comparative; $c f s . 4$ above).Note that yet does not occur in this scnse, as can bc scen by substituting it for but and howvever in the following cxamples:

5:36] a. She failed.Howcvcr, she's tried her best. b.He's not cxactly good-looking.But he's got brains. c.I sec you'rc admiring my littlc box the Knight said in a friendly tonc....You see I carry it upside-down, so that the rain can't gct in But thc things can get out,Alice gently remarked.

Here thc meaning is notdespite'but as against'to be set against';in fact the cxprcssion as against that is used in this sense, as well as on the other hand, at the same time and various others.

It can be sccn that if yet replaces however in [5:36a] the meaning is quitc different:it mcans 'in spite of the fact that she'd tried hcr best, she still failed.Thc two mcanings in spite ofthc adversative propcr,so to spcak and 'as against' can bc parallelcd within the sentcncc,in thc although (concessive) type of dcpcndent clausc.This is normally a truc adversative, and it can have ONiy this scnse if the althongh clausc precedes thc main clause (where althongh is acccnted).But providcd the although clause follows the main clause, where althongh is normally unaccented, it can express eithcr the meaning in spite of' or the mcaning'as against'. Thus we have she failed although she'd tried her hest mcaning eithcr in spite of the fact that...parallel to [535a], oras against the fact that ... parallel to [5:36c]; or although shed tried her best,she failedneaning only in spite of the fact that .  parallel to [5:3o]. Thc latter cannot mcan as againstwhich is why although he's got brainshe's not exactly goodJooking makes no sense.

Thc advcrsative relation also has its IN TERNA 1 aspcct. Here the under lying meaning is still contrary to expectationbut the source of thc cxpcctation is to be found not in what the presupposed scntence is about but in thc current speaker-hcarcr configuration, thc point reachcd in the communication processas wc cxpressed it earlicr.For example:

[5:37] a.... you'll find yourself in the Fourth Square in no time. Well, that square belongs to Tweedledum and Twecdledeethe Fifth is mostly water - the Sixth bclongs to Humpty Dumpty-But you makc no remark?' b....you might catch a bat, and thats very like a mouse, you know.But do cats eat bats,I wonder?

In a the Red Queen's reasoning is I am giving you information for which you ought to be gratcful; and yct you don't show it' that is, contrary to thc cxpectation raiscd by thc communication situation between us. Similarly in (b),Alicc recognizes that, although hcr suggestion is made with the intention of being helpful, it nay not in fact be any use.

This is as it were the intcrnal cquivalent of thc adversative proper; the meaning is not in spite of thc facts'but it is still in spitc of-in spite of the rolcs wc are playing,the state of thc argumcnt, ctcThere is another form of the adversativc relation, also internal, which we may perhaps regard as being the INTERNAL cquivalent of thc CONTRASTIVE sense identificd above,that of'as against'.This is cxprcssed by a number of very frcqucnt items such as in fact as a matter of fact actually to tell you the truth. The meaning is somcthing like as against what the current state of the communication process would lcad us to expect, the fact of the matter is...Thc conjunction takes thc form of an assertion of veracity,an AvowAL:

[5:38] Now the cleverest thing I ever didhc wcnt on after a pause, was inventing a new pudding during the meat-course. 'In timc to havc it cookcd for the next course?' said Alicc. well, that was quick work, ccrtainly Well, not the next courscthc Knight said in a slow thoughtful tonc;'nocertainly not the next course. Then it would have to bc the next day. I suppose you wouldn't have two pudding-courses in onc dinner.' Well, not the next daythe Knight repcated as bcfore:not the next day. In facthe went on,holding his hcad down, and his voice getting lower and lower,I don't believe that pudding cver was cooked! In factI don't belicvc that pudding cvcr will bc cooked!And yct it was a very clcvcr pudding to invent.

Related to this avowal'type is anothcr form of thc adversative which was mentioned above (5.4) as bordcring on the scnse of negativc comparison eg:by contrastf[5:26].This is thc sense of not..but..which we might refer to as a coRRe chion.Thc mcaning of this cohcsive relation itsclf is again internal-although, as always, thc context of its use in any particular instance may be found in the content of thc presupposed and presupposing scntences. The gencral meaning is still contrary to expectation,but here the special senseis'as against what has just bcen said; thc expectation is therc, in other words, simply because it has been put into words. The distinction betwecn this and the 'avowal' type, such as in fact, is that the latter is an assertion of'the facts'in thc face of rcal or imaginary rcsistancc (as against what you might think),whereas herc one formulation is rcjccted in favour of another (as against what you have bccn told'). Characteristic cxpressions of this relation are instead (of thatruther, on the contraryat leastI mean.The contrast may be between two alternative phenomena:

[5:39] a. He showed no pleasurc at hearing the news. Instead he looked even gloomier. b.I don't think she minds the cold. It's the damp she objccts to,rathcr.

But it may be betwecn two different formulations of the same phcnomenon:

[5:40]'What a beautiful belt you've got on!'Alicc suddenly rcmarked At least'shc corrccted herself on sccond thoughts,a bcautiful cravat I should have said-no,a belt,I mean

Finally we bring in here what may bc considered a generalized form of the adversative relation, the mcaning no matter (whether ... or not; which ...),still .. .. This prcsupposes that some circumstances have been refcrrcd to which are then dismissed as irrelevant-eithcr bccause it does not matter whethcr they obtain or not, as in [5:4ia], or bccause it does not matter which of thc given set of circumstances obtains, as in [5:41b]:

[5:41] a.Wc may be back tonight; I'm not sure. Either way, just makc yourselves at homc. b.Your partner may support you or may changc to another suit. In cither case you should respond.

DIsmissivE exprcssions includc in any/either case/event, any/either way, whichever happens, whether ..or not. Thc samc meaning is further gencralized to cover an cntircly opcn-cnded sct of possibilities:no mattcr whatic no matter undcr what circumstances, still...Taken by itself this seems to have nothing cohesivc about it; but it always prcsupposes that someTHIng has gone before, rcmote though it may be. Since whatever it is that has gone before is in any case being dismissed as irrclevant, the meaning however that may beon the internal plane oftcn amounts to nothing morc than a change of subjcct-let's leave that asidc, and turn to something else'f5.8 bclow).Thc usual modern sense of thc word however,as a specific adversativc,is in fact derived from the generalized sense which it had earlicr; in the samc way various other expressions which are essentially of this gcncralized type, such as anyhow, t any rate, are now coming to function as adversatives in the morc specific sense.Examples of thc generalized adversative rclation:

[5:42 a.I saythis isn't fair'cricd thc Unicorn,as Alicc sat with thc knife in hcr hand, very much puzzlcd how to bcgin.Thc Monster has given the Lion twice as much as me!' She's kept none for hcrself, anyhowsaid the Lion. b...the March Hare said-I didn'tthc March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.. Wcll, at any rate the Dormouse said-'the Hattcr went on.

# 5.6Causal

The simple form of cAusar relation is expressed by so, thus, hence, therefore consequently, accordingly and a number of cxprcssions like as a result of thatin consequence (of thatbecause of that.All these regularly combine with initial and. It is outside our scopc herc to go into the various positions that can be occupied by these items in the scntence, but the samc general types exist as with the adversatives. Thus so occurs only initially, unless following and ths like yet occurs initially or at least in thc first part (the Modal clement) of thc clause; therefore has the samc potentialities as however. Again adverbs such as consequently resemble thc adversative adverbs likc nevertheless; and thc prepositional expressions such as as a result (of this) have on the wholc the same potentialitics of occurrence as thosc with an adversative scnsc.

Examples:

[5:43] a.... she felt that therc was no timc to bc lost as she was shrinking rapidly; so she got to work at once to eat somc of the other bit. b.... she wouldn't have heard it at all, if it hadn't come quite close to her car.The consequence of this was that it tickled her ear very much, and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of the poor little creature.

The causal rclation may be rcitcrated so as to form a cohesive chain, as in the following cxample from Alice:

[5:44] But they have their tails in their mouths; and the reason is. that they would go with the lobstcrs to the dance.So thcy got thrown out to sea.So they had to fall a long way.So thcy got their rails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't gct thcm out again.

Under the heading of causal relations arc included thc s pe ciric oncs of RESULT REAsON and PURPOsE.These are not distinguished in the simplest form of expression; so, for cxample, mcans as a result of this, for this reason'and for this purpose'.Whcn expressed as prcpositional phrases, on the other hand, they tend to be distinct.

The distinction bctwcen the EXTERNAI and thc INTERNAL types of cohesion tends to bc a little less clearcut in the context of causal relations than it is in the othcr contexts, probably because the notion of cause already involves some degree of interpretation by the speaker.Ncvertheless the distinction is still recognizablc. The simple forms thus, hence and therefore all occur rcgularly in an INreRNAL scnse,implying some kind of reasoning or argument from a premise; in the same meaning we find expressions likc arising out of this following from this we might include also locutions such as it follows that from this it appears that we may conclude that and the likc):

[5:45]When the breakfast allowed blood sugar to be low during the morning, thc increase after lunch rose to thc levcl of cheerfulness and efficiency for only a few minutes; thcn it fcll to a low level which lastcd throughout the afternoon.Your sclection of food at breakfast, thereforc, can prcvent or produce fatigue throughout the day.\*

The word so is not common in this sense, but it occurs frequently in another mcaning, also internal, that it shares with then; this is as a statement about the speaker's reasoning processes:'I concludc from what you say (or othcr evidence)-compare cxpressions such as I gather:

[5:46] Thc very first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplacc, and shc was quite pleased to find that there was a real one, and blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind. 'So I shall bc as warm here as I was in the old room'thought Alice.

Thc ReveRseD form of the causal relation, in which the presupposing sentcnce expresses the cause, is less usual as a form of cohesion.Within the sentence, it is natural to find the structural exprcssion of cause going in either dircction; a structurc functions as a whole, and the sequcnce b, becausc a'is no less acccptable -in fact considerably more frequcntthan because a,b'.With the cohesive relation between sentences, howcver, in which the text unfolds onc sentence aftcr another, the logical precedence of cause ovcr effect is reflected in the typical sequence in which scntenccs relatcd in this way tcnd to occur.Nevertheless wc do find the reason was that and similar expressions; and thcrc is one simplc conjunction with this mcaning, namely for. This is hardly cvcr hcard in spokcn English, where its nearcst cquivalent is the word because in phonologically reduced form.Note the cxamples:

[5:47 a. The ncxt morning she was glad and proud that she had not yielded to a scare.For he was most strangely and obviously better. b.'I sce somebody now'she exclaimed at last.'But hc's coming very slowly -and what curious attitudes he gocs into! (For thc Messenger kept skipping up and down, and wriggling like an eel, as he camc along, with his great hands spread out likc fans on each side.)

In [5:47b the for is uscd in an intcrnal sense, meaning this is thc reason for what was just said'comparc [5:48] where the conjunction because means this is why I'm asking':

[5:48]You aren't leavingare you? Bccausc I've got something to say to you.

One othcr type of conjunctive relation will be considered here under the gcncral hcading of causal: this is the cONDirIONAL typc.The two are closely relatcd, linguistically;where the causal means a, thcrcfore b the conditional means 'possibly $a$ if so, then $b ^ { \prime }$ and although the thcn' and the thereforc'are not logically equivalent-a may entail $b$ without being its cause - thcy arc largcly interchangeablc as cohesive forms.

The simple form of expression of the conditional relation, meaning under thcsc circumstancesis the word then:

[5:49 a.And what does it live on? Weak tea with crcam in it. A new difficulty camc into Alice's head. 'Supposing it couldn't find any?'she suggcstcd. Then it would die, of course. b. Have some winc, the March Hare said in an encouraging tone. Alice looked all round the table, but thcre was nothing on it but tea.'I don't see any wine'she remarked. There isn't any said thc March Hare. Thcn it wasnt very civil of you to offer itsaid Alicc angrily.

Other itcms include in that case that being the casein such an cventcompare also the substitute form $i f s o$ 3.4.1.2[3106

[5:49b] illustratcs thc overlap of causal and conditional; the neaning is if, as is the casc... then....Hcrc thc cquivalent relation in sentence structure could bc expressed by cither $i f$ or since as seeing that if/since there isn't anythen it wasn't very civil of you to offer it. In [5:49a on the other hand, which is hypothetical, only $i f$ is possible. As the examplc shows, both typcs can be cxpressed in the form of conjunction. There is some diffcrcnce in thc conjunctive items that arc used to express them; so and the causal adverbs such as accordingly are, at least, possiblc in thc type represented by (b) but not in the hypothetical type, whcrcas cxpressions like in such an event are more appropriatc to the latter. The generalizcd conditional, under the circustances, may be uscd in cither scnse, though it is more often non-hypothetical.But on thc wholc thc two types have the same cohesive forms.

The negative form of the conditional, under other circumstances,is expressed cohesively by otlierwise:

[5:so] a. It's thc way I likc to go to work. One person and one linc of cnquiry at a time. Otherwise, there's a muddle. b.Whenever the horse stopped (which it did very often) he fell off in front; and whencver it went on again which it generally did rather suddenly),hc fell off behind.Otherwise he kcpt on pretty well ...

It is actually misleading to refer to this as negative'what it does is to switch the polarity, either from positive to negativc (in which casc the substitute form $i f$ not can bc used) or from ncgative to positive, as in [5:51]:

[5:51] I was not informed. Otherwise I should have taken some action.

(ie 'if I had been).Thcre arc no othcr very usual cquivalents to otherwise as a conjunctive form,although various extendcd paraphrases might still fall under this heading, eg the phrase itself under other circumstances, and perhaps thatsuch not being the case.

In thc conditional rclation, thc distinction betwcen the external and intcrnal types of cohesion is not at all cbvious.But it is probably under this heading that wc should take account of the rather vaguc REsPecTIVE kind of conjunctive link represented by expressions such as in that respect, with regard to this, in this connection. In a sense this is the INTERNAL.

analogue of the cONDiTiONAL relation: the mcaning is if wc have now rcached this point in thc discourse'The fact that these arc rclatcd to conditionals is suggested also by the usc of otherwise to exprcss thc same meaning with polarity rcverscd;otherwise is cquivalcnt not only to snder other circumstances but also to in other respects, aside/apart from this. Hcre wc come to thc border of the (internal) tenporal relation (see s.7 bclow); there is a closc similarity between the meaning if we leave aside what has just been said'and'we now pass on to the next point'.Two examples will suffice:

[5:52] a.One factor is the level of taxation of pcrsonal incomes. With regard to this question, the impressions current among membcrs of the public are often very far rcmoved from the truth. b.The musicians thcmselves wcrc somcwhat disappointed at the relative lack of intercst displayed in the new works which they presented. Leaving that aside, the whole tour scems to have bccn rcmarkably successful.

# 5.7Temporal

The relation bet ween thc theses of two succcssive sentences - that is, their rclation in external tcrms, as content- may bc simply onc of scqucnce in time: the one is subscquent to the othcr. This TEMpoRAl rclation is cxpressed in its simplest form by then:

[5:53]Alice) began by taking the little golden kcy and unlocking the door that led into thc garden.Thcn shc sct to work nibbling at the mushroom... till she was about a foot high: then she walked down the little passage : and then - shc found herself at last in thc beautiful garden.

In this sEQueNTIAl scnsc wc have not only then and and then but also nextafterwards after that, subsequently and a numbcr of other expressions.

[5:54]a.[continuation of [5:49a]]But that must happen very often, Alice remarked thoughtfully. It always happens, said the Gnat. After this, Alice was silent for a minute or two,pondering b....shc heard a little shrick and a fall, and a crash of brokcn glass, from which she concluded that it was just possiblc it had fallcn into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort. Next came an angry voice -the Rabbit's -Pat! Pat! Where are you?' And then a voice she had never hcard before,..

The temporal rclation may be madc more specific by thc prcsence of an additional component in the meaning, as well as that of succcssion in timc. Sc, for cxample, we may have then $^ +$ immcdiatcly'at once, thercuponon which)then $^ { + }$ after an intervalsoonpresentlylaterafter a tie);'then + repetition'next time, on another occasion)thcn +a specific time intervalnext dayfive minntes later and so on.Examples:

[5:55] a.Tickcts, pleascsaid the Guard, putting his head in at thc window. In a moment cverybody was holding out a tickct. b.'You alarm me!'said thc King.I fccl faint -Give mc a ham-sandwich!' On which the Messengcr, to Alice's great amusement, opened a bag that hung round his neck, and handed a sandwich to the King,who dcvouredit grecdily.

In all these instanccs thc cxternal tcmporal relation is parallelcd by the sequence of the sentences thcmselves: thc second sentence refcrs to a later event.But this is not neccssarily the case; the second sentence may bc rclated to the first, still by mcans of temporal cohesion, through an indication that it is sIMULTANEOUs in time, or even PREvIous. In the sense of'simultaneous'we havejust then,at the sane time,simultaneously and here too the simple timc relation may be accompanied by some other component,eg'then + in thc interval'(meanwhile, all this tine),then+ repctition'(on this occasionthis time),thcn + momcnt of time'at this point/moment),then + termination'(by this time),and so on:

[5:56] a.... That will be a queer thing to be surc However, cverything is queer today. Just thcn shc heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off... b.You'll get used to it in timcsaid thc Caterpillar; and it put thc hookah into its mouth and began smoking again. This time Alicc waited patiently until it chosc to speak again.

In the sensc of 'prcvious'we have earlier,before that, previously,with, again, the possibility of combination with othcr meanings:bcfore + specific time intcrval'(five minutes earlier),before + immediately'(just beforebefore + termination'up till that time ntil then)before + repctition'on a previous occasion,and so on:

[5:57] a. The organ... devcloped an ornamental stylc of its own, which playcrs of othcr instruments werc rccommendcd to imitate in the early sixtcenth century.Hitherto, the role of thc organ in sacrcd music had not apparently called for any such virtuoso treatment.\*

b.The weather cleared just as the party approachcd the sunmit. Until then thcy had seen nothing of the panorama around them.

The presupposing sentence may be temporally cohesive not because it stands in some particular time relation to thc presupposed sentence but bccause it marks the end of some proccss or serics of processes.This CONciusive scnse is cxpressed by itcms such as finally at last, in the end.eventually:

[5:58] All this time the Guard was looking at her, first through a telescope, then through a microscopc, and then through an opera-glass. At last he said You're travelling the wrong way, and shut up the window and went away.

In one respect temporal conjunction differs from all other types, namely in that it does occur in a coRReLATive form, with a cataphoric timc expression in one sentencc anticipating the anaphoric one that is to follow. The typical cataphoric temporal is first also at first, first of all to begin with, etc.Given any onc of thesc, thc expectation is that an itcm such as then, next second or finally will follow:

[5: 59] [Obrecht] subjects his cantus firmus to the most abstruse manipulations.First,he extracts all the longs from the tunc, and strings them together in succession; then hc does thc samc with the breves, and finally with the semibreves. He then reverses this proccdure, starting with thc shorter values first.\*

In tcmporal cohesion it is fairly easy to identify and interpret the distinction betwecn the ExTERNAL and the INTERNAL type of conjunctive rclation. In the INTERNAL type thc successivity is not in thc cvents being talked about but in the communication process. The mcaning next in the coursc of discussion' is typically expressed by the words next or then, or by secondlythirdlyctc, and the culmination of thc discussion is indicated by expressions such as finallyas a final pointin conclusion

[5:60] a. What sort of insects do you rejoice in, where you comc from?'the Gnat inquired . Well, there's thc Horse-fly Alicc began counting off the names on her fingers.. And then there's the Butterfly'Alice went on.

b.Finally we should rccord that the influence of thc humanists contributcd a good deal towards thc final dccay of thc plainsong tradition.\*

The sensc of temporal successivity in the enumcration of points in an argument is clearly shown by the strong tendency to anticipate a scqucnce of points by the use of the cataphoric conjunctivc first, or rclatcd cxpressions such as in the first place:

[5:61'Therc's no sort of use in knockingsaid thc Footman, and that for two rcasons.First, because ${ \vec { \Gamma } } { \mathfrak { m } }$ cn the same side of thc door as you arc; sccondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no onc could possibly hear you.

In this particular instance thc two cohering passages are punctuated as a single scntence, but the rclation bctwccn thcm is cohesivc rather than structural.

Onc important type of internal tcmporal conjunction which is linked to thc onc just discussed is the rclating of what is bcing said to thc particular stagc which the communication process has reachcd: to the HERE A ND Now of thc discourse, as it were.This may take a pastpresent or future form. Typical expressions are: past, up to now, up to this point hitherto, heretofore; prcsent, at this point, here future, from now on, henceforward, hereunder; etc.Examples:

[5:62 a. The Middle Ages have become the Rcnaissance, and a new world has come into being: our world. In what way is it our world'At this point we run into some difficulty.\* b.And thcn we are back in a strange land, the later Middlc Ages, whcre our modern preoccupations can only hinder understanding.So far wc have tricd to imaginc thc way an interested but uninstructed listener night react, in general terns, to early Renaissancc music. It is now timc to go into greater detail.\*

We have not citcd any equivalent cxternal forms of cxpression; not because they do not exist but because they are not cohesive, thcy are deictic.Exprcssions like nowp to nowin futre rclatc what is bcing said to the present situation, the here and now'of reality; they do not therefore presupposc anything in the preceding text.If on the other hand, here and now' mcans hcre and now in thc textthen such forms will have a cohesive cffect.

These internal aspccts of the temporal relations are temporal in the sense that they refer to the time dimension that is present in the communication process. The communication process is certainly a process in real time; but it is at onc removc from the time dimension of thc processes of the external world that form the content of communication.Hence this time two'is felt to be alrcady in some way a mctaphorical extension of the concept of timc as in thc time one' of these cxternal processes; and this makes it fairly casy for it to be extended stillfurther into meanings that arc not really temporal at all.

By such an cxtension we move froni the scnse of finally, to conclude' to that of to round off the point and hcnce to sum up Thc expressions finally,in conchnsion are thcmsclves uscd in this cul minATIVE sense; it is rcasonable to suggest thercfore that the meaning of 'to sum up' is basically a form of temporal conjunction even when expresscd by othcr itcms such as to sun upin short in a wordto put it briefly

[s:63] Your nutrition can determine how you look, act and feel; whether you are grouchy or cheerful, homely or beautiful, physiologically and even psychologically young or old; whcther you think clcarly or are confused, enjoy your work or makc it a drudgery, incrcasc your earning power or stay in an economic rut. The foods you cat can make the difference bctween your day ending with frcshness which lets you cnjoy a delightful cvening or with cxhaustion which forces you to bed with the chickens.To a considcrable degree, your nutrition can givc you a coddled-egg personality or make you a human dynamo. In short, it can determinc your zest for life the good you put into it, and the fulfilment you get from it.\*

And finally by a still further cxtension we may include hcre the scnse of to rcturn to the point, whcrc the speaker indicates that hc is resuming the main purpose of the communication following a digression of somc kind. This ResuMprivE relation is also, of course, an intcrnal onc, and is cxpressed by words and phrascs such as anyway, to resume, to come back to the point:

[5:64] The distinction between reliability and validity made above is an important one. It is perfectly possible for an examination to be reliable but invalid; reliablc in the sense that different examiners would award the samc marks to thc same paper. For examplc, in a country where I uscd to work it was not uncommon for examinations to includc a qucstion in which students were asked to explain the meanings of allegedly well-known'English proverbs. Thcy were in fact usually Victorian in character and had long ago droppcd out of popular usage, if indeed thcy had cver been represented in it. The way in which sensible students used to prepare for this question was to buy bazaar cribs which listed and explained proverbs, and to learn the contents by heart.The marking was thcrcforc rcasonably reliable, but by no stretch of thc imagination could the procedure be called valid. It was not a tcst of English. To return to the effects of examinations upon teaching;when a teacher docs his own tcsting then there need be no effcct on his teaching, for hc can tcst according to his own criteria, whatever they might be.\*

# 5.8 Other conjunctive items (continuatives)

In this final scction we bring together a number of individual items which, although they do not express any particular one of the conjunctive relations identificd above, are ncvcrthcless used with a cohesive force in the text. If neccssary these can bc referred to simply as conrinuAhives.

In a sense this is a residual category of the usual misccllancous' type. But there is a reason for its existence.Wc have tried to group togethcr,in each of the four preceding sections, both those items which express a particular Ex rERNAl relation,adversative, temporal and so on, and those items which express somc IN rE RNAL rclations that arc closely linked to it. Since in the najority of instances the sanc itcms occur in both senses this seems justifiable. For example, next mcans both next in timc, of the proccsses bcing talked about' and next in sequence in the current communication process $\rho _ { \xi }$ next of thc points in an argument) and one docs not immediatcly think of thesc as two different meanings.But thcsc internal relations may bc regarded as an extension of thc underlying patterns of conjunction into the communication situation itsclf, treating it, and thereby also the text - the linguistic componcnt of thc communication process-as having by analogy the same structurc as reality'that is, as thc phenomena that constitute the content, or rHesis, of the text.

But thc analogy is imperfect, in the scnse that it is not cxhaustive.Therc are somc subtle and complex rclations within thc communication process that cannot bc closely modelled on thosc of cxtcrnal processes.We shall not try to treat these in principlc, but shall simply discuss informally onc or two very frcquent itcms that do not readily fall into the four conjunctive categorics dealt with above.Following this we shall cnd with a note on the place of intonation as a conjunctive device.

We can in fact inscrt a brief general statcment about thc intonation pattern that is associated with the conrinuATIvE itcms thcmselves. In general, whcn functioning cohesively thcy are'reduccd'forms (ie unaccented and with reduced vowel values of itcms which also occur, but not cohesively, in a full'(non-reduced) form.Thcir mcaning as conjunctive items is derivable from thcir meaning as full forms; thcir phonological reduction is simply a signal that they havc in fact a backwardlinking function-we have sccn throughout all the chapters of this work how cohesive items tend to be cntirely non-promincnt in intonation and accent, unless they are very dcfinitely contrastive.

Six items will be discusscd: now of course well anyway surely after all.

# 5.8.1Now

If it is tonic, nou is deictic and not cohcsive unless it is made to be cohesive by the intonation pattern contrasting with before,ctc; see 5.9 below).If it is reduced, it means thc opcning of a new stage in the comnunication; this may be a new incident in thc story,a new point in the argument a new rolc or attitude bcing taken on by the speaker, and so on. For examplc,in a transaction situation such as a shop encounter, the transition from phatic communion to transactional relations is often made by now: Now what would you like, dear?Othcr cxamples:

[5:65] a. Arc you ready? Now when I tcll you to jump, close your cyes and jump. b.A slow sort of country!said the Queen.Now, here you scc, it takes all the running you can do, to kecp in thc same place.' c.A loaf of brcad' the Walrus said, Is what we chicfly need Pepper and vinegar bcsides Are very good indeedNow if you're ready, Oystcrs dear, We can begin to feed.

# 5.8.2Of course

If tonic, this means you should have known that alreadyas in [s:66a]. If reduced,it means'I acccpt the fact'or,rhetoricallyyou must accept the fact-it is typically used, therefore, to disarm someone into accepting something the speaker knows he is likely to reject. The sccond meaning is a kind of subliminal form of the first it often has a slightly adversative forcc, of thc as against that'typc, derived from the fact that it suggests that somcthing should have been obvious butwas overlooked,as in b) below:

[5:66] a.Everything's just as it was!Of course it is,said thc Qucen. b. They were going to come to the meeting. Of course they may have changcd their minds. c. You find these properties expensive? Of course prices have increased lately, you know.

# 5.8.3Well

This occurs typically at the beginning of a response in dialogue. (We ignore here its use in thc original sense, as the adverbial equivalent of good and also the sense as an attribute meaning in good health) If tonic,it means I acknowledge the question, and will give a considcred answer, often thereforc amounting to no more than a hesitation noise: I'm thinking about it More or less the same nieaning is expressed by various other items such as as to that.If reduced,well scrves to indicatc that what follows is in fact a response to what has preceded: in other words, it slips in quictly the rcspondent's claim to be answering the qucstion (sometimes with a show of reluctance) and hencc is purely cohcsive in function.If it is used in a continuation by the samc speakcr, it introduces an explanatory comment $( c f$ [5:37a] above. Sec also [s:6oa], and the linguistic discussion bctween Alice and Humpty Dumpty from which cxamplc [5:10] is takcn - [5:67a] is taken from thc same context:

[5:67 a.And what docsoutgrabemean? Well,"outgribingis something between bellowing and whistling, with a kind of sneeze in the middle ...' b. Do I look vcry pale?'said Tweedledum, coming up to have his helmet ticd on.. Well - yes - a little, Alice replied gently.

# 5.8.4 Anyway

The very frcquent use of this word that we arc referring to here derives from its meaning as described under thc heading of adversative above (s.5). In its tonic form it is what wc called Dismissive, meaning no matter undcr which,or what,circumstances'but it also occurs very frequently in a rcduced form, in which case it indicates cohesion with thc preceding sentencc by simply brushing it asidc. The meaning is thus also related to the REsuMPrIVE typc cxemplified in [s:64]in 5.7that is,to come back to the point'.But this sense is often hardly felt to be prcscnt, so we include anyway here as a continuative. One or two other items occur with this same meaning of'let's get on with the jobeg:anyhow,at any rate:

[5:68] a. They changed ovcr to a most peculiar kind of train which you don't see now. I've forgotten what it was callcd.Was it called a steam coach'?I can't remember.Anyway it was just one coach but it ran by steam and it made a funny noise. b.The last time she saw thcm, they wcrc trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.At any ratc I'll never go there again' said Alice as shc picked her way through the wood.

# 5.8.5 Surely

If tonic, this invites the hearer to assent to the proposition being enunciated;it is not cohesive, except in the cataphoric scnse that a question is cohesive:it demands an answer.If rcduced, it has what is basically thc cohesive equivalent of thc same mcaning; that is, am I right in my understanding of what's just been said?and somctimcs specifically you can't have meant...?'For example:

[5:69 Theyl1 think you're serious.-Nobody could bc so stupid as to think that, surely.

# 5.8.6 After all

In its tonic form,this meansafter everything relcvant has been considered, what remains is...As usual the tone is either I or 4, in thcir typical senses of in addition to...and in spite of...(what may have bcen understood.Compare taking everything into consideration, when all's said and done. Again, although not itsclf cohcsivc this mcaning becomes cohesive in context, so after all functions as a continuativc cspecially when phonologically reduccd: the sense is what I have just said is rcasonable, when evcrything is takcn into account'.

[5:7o] You needn't apologize.After all nobody could have known what would happen.

# 5.9 The cohesivc function of intonation

Continuatives of the kind just discussed arc as it were subdued cohcsives; thcy coherc by stcalth. A meaning that is basically not conjunctive, like at time prescnt'now),or this is to be expected'of course),bccomes cohesive when it is slipped in as an incidental or as an aftcrthought, since its interpretation bccones contingent on the context (and therefore on the preceding text).It is interesting that therc is a general tcndency in spoken English for conjunctive elements as a wholc to bc, phonologically, either tonic (maximally prominent) or reduccd (minimally prominent), rather than anything in bctwecn. This can bc explained, very simply, by reference to the function of intonation in English grammar.

Cohesive elcments relate the sentence to something that has gone before it; they are normally anaphoric- there is no new contcnt to thcm.Now, anaphoric items in English are phonologically non-prominent, as rcmarked abovc, and this usually cxtends to thcir syllabic structure: in other words thcy arc reduccd'But if thc cohesivc relation itsclf is to be brought into focus of attention this is markcd in the usual way by tonic prominence. This takes the form of the tonic either of tone 1 (falling),if the gencral sense is cumulAnive, or (perhaps morc frcquently) of tonc 4 (fallingrising),if the general sense is CONTRAsTIVE.

We concludc this chapter with a brief discussion of the cohesive function of intonation,since this is closely related to conjunction and may bc considered as expressing forms of conjunctive relation.

Thc FALl-RIsE intonation pattern in English,TONE 4 has in many contexts a scnse of rescrvation, there's a but about it'. This is not necessarily a cohesive factor, since the nature of the rescrvation may not be made explicit. But in many instances the fall-rise intonation pattern provides a clear indication and oftcn the only indication that the item on which it falls is to be interpreted as contrasting with a preceding item; and in such instances, the function of the tone is specifically cohesive.We have already mentioncd the falling (tone 1 and falling-rising (tone 4 intonation patterns in thc discussion on the advcrsative in 5.5 above, illustrating the fact that these toncs are characteristically associated with contexts where therc are already cohesive items prcsent. This is a vcry gencral phenomenon; the fall-rise tone pattcrn adds the sense of contrast, as in [5:32c], and

[5:71 a.Lct's go back to the last remark but one.I'm afraid I can't quite remember it,'Alice said very politely. 'In that case $( j / 4$ in IHAT Casc $/ / )$ we may start afrcsh'said Humpty Dumpty. b.Wc've been stuck in this traffic for thrce quartcrs of an hour. Another timc $( 1 / 4$ ANOTHER time $/ / )$ we'll go by train.

Very frequently,however, the tone alone shows that the item in question is cohesive; the cohesion consists just in the contrast with some preceding item.There is no doubt about the presupposing force of the fall-rise tone in the following cxamples:

[5:72] a. Seven jogged my elbow.... That's right, Five! Always lay the blame on others!'Youd better not talk!'said Five. $( / / 4$ YOU'D better not talk/) b.People used to dress up to go to the theatre. $\mathrm { N o w } \left( / / 4 \ \mathrm { N O w } / / \right)$ they wear any old thing. c.The only difficulty is with the fect. The head is high cnough already' $( / / 4$ the HEAD/1 is high cnOugh ALREADY $/ / )$ d.That is not said rightsaid thc Caterpillar.Not quite right, I'm afraid' said Alice timidly $( / / 4$ not qurE right, I'm afraid $1 1 .$ - e.Evidently Humpty Dumpty was very angry,though he said nothing for a minutc or two. When hc did speak again, it was in a deep growl. $( / / 4$ when he DID speak again /)

In a) which can only be read $1 / 4$ YOU'D better not talk $/ / ,$ the sense is you should be concerned with yourself, instead of criticizing me'In b) the tone 4 on now is cohesive becausc it contrasts the present with what used to happcn. In c the head contrasts with the feet and in d) not quite right contrasts with not right, modifying it by reference to its original absolute form. In (c the marked positive form did speak contrasts with negative said nothing.

The rALLING tone, TONE 1,if it is used in the contcxt of a cohcsivc element, has thc sense of 'and hcrc's something more'The additive cohesive itens normally have this tone, if they carry tonic prominencc at all, just as the adversative normally has tone 4-although,as always with the English intonation systcm, both can be rcvcrsed, to givc a flavour of the.opposite meaning: for cxamplc, moreover can bc spoken on tone 4 meaning 'there is somcthing clse, despite what you may think, and however on tone I mcaning thcre is a reservation to bc exprcssed, so wait!'

Unlike tone 4,tone I does not by itself carry any cohcsive force. But therc is a strong case for considcring the LOw RisinG tonc (preceded by mid level)rONE 3,as the cohesive variety of tone I,sincc it docs function in other respects as a kind of dcpendent or non-autonomous cquivalent of thc falling tone. So for examplc in

[5:73] a.The little stable boy went to bcd feeling very excited.In thc morning $( 3 / 1$ in the MORNING $/ / )$ he packed his bag and left home.

thc tone shows that in the morning is cohesively rclated to the preceding sentencc, and means next morningThis tone would be inappropriate, for cxample, in a sentence such as [s:73b] occurring initially in the discoursc, whcre in the morning means every morning' and cannot be cohesive:

[5:73] b. In the morning I'm usually very tired.

But both tone 3 and tone 4 arc also used in contexts whcre thc relation which thcy signal is a structural one, to a preceding or, morc oftena following clause within the same sentence. In such instances thcy are not cohcsivc in the sense in which the term is defined hcrc.\*

Naturally, the type of cohesion outlined in the last fcw paragraphs appcars only in spoken English, since the cohesion is bcing expressed through thc medium of intonation. Intonation, howevcr, has a vcry farrcaching and pervasive function in the grammar of thc spoken language, so that it is not surprising that it should play a significant part in this particular rcgion.As we havc cmphasized throughout, cohesive relations arc on the borders of grammar, and it is likely that somc of the specific grammatical functions of the intonation system derive in thc first place from its role in the expression of cohesion within a text.

# Chapter 6

# Lexical Cohesion

# 6.1 The class ofgcneral nouns

In the previous four chapters,we havc described the various types of grammatical cohesion: rcference, substitution and ellipsis, and conjunction. In ordcr to complete the picture of cohcsive relations it is necessary to take into account also lexical cohesion. This is the cohcsive effcct achieved by thc selection of vocabulary.

On the bordcrline between grammatical and lcxical cohesion is the cohcsive function of the class.of GENeRAL NoUN. We can speak about a borderline here bccause a general noun is itself a borderline case bctween a lexical item (member ofan open sct)and a grammatical item(member of a closed system).

The class of general noun is a sinall set of nouns having generalized reference within the major noun classes, thosc such as 'human noun, place nounfact noun and the like.Examples are:

people,person man, woman, child, boy,girl [human]   
creature [non-human animate]   
thing, object [inanimate concrete count]   
stuff  [inanimate concrete mass]   
business, affair, matter [inanimate abstract]   
move[action]   
place [place]   
questionidea [fact]

These items are often neglectcd in descriptions of English; but they play a significant part in verbal interaction, and are also an important source of cohcsion in thc spoken languagc. Thc following examples illustrate their cohesive function:

[6:1 a. Didn't everyonc make it clear thcy expected thc minister to

resign?-Thcy did. But it scems to havc made no imprcssion on thc man.   
b.I should likc to bc a little largcr, sir, if you wouldn't mind said Alicc:'three inchcs is such a wretched height to be. It's a very good height indeed!'said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spokc it was cxactly thrce inches high). But I'm not used to it!'plcaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought to hcrsclf,I wish the creatures wouldnt bc so casily offended!'   
c.What shall I do with all this crockery?-Leave the stuff there; someone'll comc and put it away.   
d.We all kept quict.That seemed the best move.   
e.Can you tell me whcre to stay in Gencva?I'vc ncver been to the place.   
f.Hcnry sccms convinced there's money in dairy farming.I don't know what gave him that idea.

As these cxamples show,a gcncral noun in cohesive function is almost always accompanicd by the referencc item the. This the is anaphoric,and the cffect is that the whole complex 'the $^ +$ general noun' functions like an anaphoric rcfcrcncc itcm. The most usual alternative to the is a demonstrative, and if a demonstrative occurs it usually carries the tonic: $c f .$ that idea in example 6:if.This relates to the fact that the general noun itsclf does Nor carry the tonic if it is functioning cohcsivcly;a fact which holds truc even when it occurs in final position, which is the unmarked location of tonic prominencc.Hcncc in [6:1a, d,e and f] it would be highly improbable, and strongly contrastive, to assign tonic prominence to nanmoveplace and idea.

The above gives us some indication of the status of general nouns. From a lexical point of vicw they are the supcrordinatc menbers of major lexical sets, and thercfore their cohesivc use is an instance of the general principlc whcreby a supcrordinate item operates anaphorically as a kind of synonymsee 6.2 bclow).From a grammatical point of vicw, the combination of gencral noun plus spccific dcterminer,such as the nanthe thingis very similar to a reference itcm.Therc is little difference between it seens to have made very little impression on the man and it seems to have made very little inpression on hi: in both instanccs interpretation is possiblc only by reference to somcthing that has gonc before.But it is not the casc that thcrc is no differcncc at all: the form with general noun, the man, opens up another possibility, that of introducing an interpersona! clement into the meaning, which is absent in thc case of the personal pronoun.It may be worth stressing once again that the fact that gencral nouns arc very general in meaning, and thercfore often interpretable only by refercncc to some clement other than themselves, does not makc them unimportant in the language. Since they require recourse to another item, that itcm must be located earlicr within the samc tcxt; and this means that they play a significant rolc in making a text hang together.)

The cxpression of interpersonal meaning, of a particular attitude on the part of the speaker, is an important function of gencral nouns. Essentially the attitude conveyed is onc of familiarity, as opposed to distance, in which the speaker assumes thc right to represent the thing he is referring to as it impinges on him pcrsonally; hence thc specific attitude may be cither contemptuous or sympathetic, the two being closely related as forms of personal involvemcnt (cf the meaning of diminutives in many languages).There are quitc a few general nouns which have this interpcrsonal element as an inhcrcnt part of their meaning,cspecially those refcrring to human beings,for examplc idiot,fool, devil, dear and these arc supplemented, at any one moment in time, by a host of more or less slang tcrms differing widely from one social group and one generation to another. But whether or not it is inhcrently attitudinal in meaning, a general noun in cohesive function can always be accompanied by an attitudinal Modifier. So we have cxamples such as the dears, the poor dears; and also the stupid thing,the lucky fellow and so on:

[6:2] a. I've becn to sec my great-aunt.The poor old girl's getting very forgetful these days. b.Alice caught thc baby with some difficulty, as it was a queershaped little crcature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions,just like a star-fishthought Alice.The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it... c.Henry's thinking of rowing thc Atlantic. Do go and talk to the wretched fool.

These forms with interpcrsonal elements in their meaning have certain special features when they are used cohesively. The general nouns may be transcategorized up the scale inanimate-animate-human, with creature being uscd for hunan as well as animate, and thing for all threc f 3.2.3 above).The adjectives cannot bc submodified, by words such as very,nor can they bc compared.Only adjcctives with an attitudinal mcaning can occurit would not bc possible to say the fat an in [6:1a-or if onc did,by virtue of its occurrcnce in this context fat would become attitudinal.A general noun in cohesive function can in fact accept only non-defining Modifiers; since it rcfers back o thc entire nominal group with which it is to bc idcntified for its interprctation,it carries over any defining elcments from this nominal group, and hencc it must itsclf remain undefined. Attitudinal adjectives are by their nature non-defining.Herc is a Shakespearcan cxample (the good man referring to Lcar):

[6:3] All blest sccrets, All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth, Spring with my tears!be aidant and remcdiate In the good man's distress!

As a corollary of their carrying over of dcfinitcness, general nouns of the human class are very frcquently used in anaphoric rcference to personal names. It is intcresting that the othcr use of these nouns, when thcre is an attitudinal elcment prescnt either in the noun itself or in the form of modification,is as vocatives: terms of abuse or endcarment you crazy fool! and the like.Thcre they are exophoric instead of anaphoric; and this undcrlines the fact that thc typical context in which they function is a referential one, so that like refcrence items they refer cither to the situation or to thc preceding tcxt.

The intcrpersonal element of attitudc, however, although it is frcquently associated with the cohesive usc of general nouns, is by no means always present; this kind of anaphoric reference does not nccessarily embody any attitudinal mcaning.Thc following arc entirely ncutral:

[6:4] a.Ive just read John Smith's essay.Thc wholc thing is very well thought out. b.Robert secms very worried about something.I think you ought to havc a talk with the boy.

Here thc items thing and boy rcfer anaphorically to John Smith's essay and Robert rcspectively; and again the identity of reference is signallcd by the presencc of the anaphoric refcrcnce item the.

# 6.2 Types of reiteration

Thus thc usc of gencral nouns as cohesive agents depends on thcir occurring in thc context of reference-having thc saine rcferent as the itcm which thcy prcsuppose, this being signalled by the accompaniment of a reference item.

This use of general words as cohcsive clements, however, when sccn from the lexical point of vicw, is mercly a spccia case of a nuch more general phenomenon which wc may term REIrERA TioN.Rcitcration is a form of lexical cohesion which involves thc repetition of a lexical item, at onc cnd of thc scale; the use of a gcncral word to refer back to a lcxical item,at thc other cnd of thc scale; and a number of things in betweenthe use of a synonym,ncar-synonym, or superordinate. Let us illustrate cach of thesc in turn.

[6:5 a. There was a large mushroom growing ncar her, about the same hcight as herself and, whcn she had looked under it, it occurred to hcr that she night as well look and see what was on the top of it. Shc stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the cdgc of the mushroom,. b.Accordingly..I took lcavc, and turned to thc ascent of thc pcak. The climb is perfectly casy . c.Then quickly rose Sir Bcdiverc, and ran, And leaping down the ridges lightly,plung'd Among the bulrush beds,and clutch'd the sword And lightly wheel'd and threw it.The great brand Made light'nings in the splcndour of the moon.. d.Henry's bought himself a new Jaguar.He practically livcs in the car.

In a)there is REpEion:mushroon rcfcrs back to Hshroom. Inb) climb refers back to ascent of which it is a synonym.Inc) brand rcfers back to swordof which it is a near syNonyM. Ind),car refers back to Jaguarand car is a supERoRDiNATE of Jaguar-that is,a name for a more gcncral class as vehicle is a supcrordinate of car spoon of teaspoon ct of pare, and so on). All these are cohesive in exactly thc samc way as the GENERAL wORDS illustrated in $\left[ 6 : \mathbb { I } - 4 \right]$ thc latter diffcr only in level of generality.

All these instances have in common the fact that one lexical item rcfers back to another, to which it is rclated by having a common referent.We shall refer to this gencral phenomenon as REIT E RA TION.A reiterated item may be a rcpetition,a synonym or near-synonym, a superordinate, or a general word; and in most cases it is accompanied by a rcfercnce item, typically the.

At the sane timc, therc is no sharp dividing line bctween these forms, consisting of a rclated lcxical item plus anaphoric the and the personal reference forms such as lie and it. We can in fact recognize a continuum, or clineof cohesive clements; for example (adapting [6:sb] above):

The ascent The climb is perfectly [6:6] I turned to thc ascent of the peak. The task The thing casy. It

Herc wc have (1) the same item repcated, $\left( 2 \right)$ a synonym3 a superordinatc,(4) a gcncral noun and $( s )$ a pcrsonal reference item.Herc scent and climb arc lexical items whosc intcrprctation In rHs InsraNCE is shown by anaphoric the to be idcntical with that of an earlicr lexical item to which they are related cither by repetition (ascent) or by synonymy (climb).The same is true of task,cxcept that task is a more general term, higher in the lexical taxonomy; so the cohesive environment of the word task adds specificity to it-when we intcrprct the task by reference to the ascent of the peak wc identify the particular kind of task referred to.Thc word thing is an cven more general term which is being used in cxactly thc same way; but it is still morc specific than it, bccausc it usually cxcludes people and animals, as well as qualities, states and relations, and it always excludes facts and reports. Most general of all is the reference item it; but even it is not a pure'phoric clement since it likewise embodies some specificity, though only minimal: it cxcludcs people. The form it concs closest to being an alternative realization of general noun $^ +$ reference item, as in the thing.

Hence the boundary bctween lcxical cohesion of thc type we arc calling REITERATION, and grammatical cohesiOn of the RErERENCE type, is by no means clearcut; thc class of general nouns provides a forn of cohesion that lies somewhcrc in between the two, and is interpretable as either. Herc wc arc intcrpreting it as lexical cohesion, and bringing it under the gencral hcading of what we are calling reiteration.When wc talk about REIreRATion, thereforc, we are including not only the rcpctition of the same lexical itcm but also the occurrence of a related item, which may be anything from a synonym or ncar synonym of the original to a general word dominating the entire class. Lct us categorize thesc as abovc: any instance of reiteration may bc a) the sAME worD,b a SYNONYM Or NEAR-SYNONYMca SUPERORDINATE Or d)a GENERAL wORD.For cxample:

[6:7] There's a boy climbing that tree. a. The boy's going to fall if he doesn't take care.

b.Thc lad's going to fall if he doesn't takc care.   
c.The child's going to fall if he doesn't takc care.   
d.Thc idiot's going to fall if he doesn't takc carc.

In a,boy is rcpeated. In b)the reiteration takes thc form of a synonym ladin c),of the superordinate term child; and in d),of a general word idiot. It is typical of such general words, at least thosc referring to pcople, as we have secn, that they carry a connotation of attitude on the part of the speaker, usually one of familiarity derogatory or intimate).Hcrc is another example,this timc with a non-human referent:

[6:8] There's a boy climbing the old elm. a. That elm isn't very safe. c.That tree isn't very safc. d.That old thing isn't vcry safc.

Hcrca) repeats elnc selccts the superordinate tree, and d the gcncral word thing. It is difficult to find a synonym of the same degree of specificity in this example; we could find one in a series like:There's a boy climbing along the rafters.(a Those rafters $\cdots ( 6 )$ Those beams...c Those tinbers...(d) Those things.... The category of superordinate, illustratcd in c),refers to any item whosc meaning includes that of the carlier onc; in technical tcrms, any itcm that dominates the earlier one in the lexical taxonomy. There are often several possiblc superordinate terms, words that are intermcdiatc between thc lowest level, rcpresented by (a) and (b), and the highest, rcpresented by (d).That is to say, there may bc various degrees of generality intermediatc betwcen the prcsupposed itcm itself, eg: elmn in [6:8], on the one hand, and a very gencral word like thing on the other. Words with intermediatc status are more open to modification, though still with a tendency to somc cvaluative meaning,eg:this eminent author.

The general words, which correspond to major classes of lexical items, are as we have said very commonly used with cohesive force.Thcy are on the borderline between lexical items and substitutes. Thc substitutes one and do can be thought of as bcing as it werc thc highest points in the lexical taxonomy of nouns and vcrbs respectively; as such, they constitute a closed class, and so acquire a purely grammatical function. Next below them come the general words, such as thingperson make,do and so on;these,although limited in number,are not clearly bounded and it is hardly possible to compile a definitive list of them.They do function more or less as lexical items, so when they occur cohcsively we can trcat them as instanccs of lexical cohesion.But there is no sharp line between substitutes and gencral words-because there is no very sharp line between grammar and vocabulary: thc vocabulary, or lexis, is simply the opcnended and most  dclicate' aspcct of the grammar of a languagc.

Not all gencral words are used cohesively; in fact, only thc nouns are, for the reason notcd above, namely that a gencral word is cohesive only when in thc context of reference-that is, when it has the samc refcrent as whatever it is prcsupposing,and whcn it is accompanied by a rcfcrence item.All the types of lexical cohesion that we havc considered up to this point have involved identity of refcrcnce;no matter whether thc rcitcrated item has been a repetition, a synonym, a superordinate or a gcncral werd, it has been assumed to share a common rcfcrent with the original. Keeping to this assumption for thc moment wc can shift our point of view from the grammatical to the lcxical and look at reference from the lexical angle, interprcting it as a means of avoiding the repetition of lexical items and thus making it clear that if the lexical item had been reiterated it would havc had the same referent.

The simplest illustration of this is provided by proper names. Suppose we have

[6:9] John took Mary to the dancc.John was left all alone -how do we know whether it's the same John? The answer to this is if you want to makc it clear that it is the same John don't call him John call him he. In othcr words we use a reference item and this conveys the meaning the prescnt sentence is relatcd to the last one by the fact that both contain a refecrence to the same individual'.This docs not mean that a repcated propcr noun can never havc the same referent as it had on its first occurrence; the second John courD rcfer to the same person as the first -we simply do not know whethcr it does or not. If John is repeated, we nccd some further signal to tell us how to interpret it.

With common nouns, the means arc readily available; the signal is given by a rcfcrcnce item,typically the.So for example in

[6:1o] Just then a Fawn camc wandering by:it looked at Alicc with its largc gentle eyes, but didn't sccm at all frightened... What do you call yourself?'the Fawn said at last.

the signals the Fawn rcfcrrcd to on this sccond occasion is the same Fawn as that rcferred to in the (or some) prcceding sentence.

From this it would sccm that it is not thc repetition of thc word Fawn that has the cohesive cffect,but only its repetition accompanied by an anaphoric refercncc item.This might suggest that there was no distinct category of LExIcAL cOHEsION;that what we are callinglexical cohesion was merely the reitcration of a lcxical item in a context of grammatical cohesion, the cohesion bcing simply a mattcr of refcrence. But that is not,in fact, the whole story.It is true that lcxical reiteration, where the reference is idcntical, is usually made explicit by means of an anaphoric reference itcm.But there are other types of lexical cohesion which do not depend on identity of reference; patterns of word occurrences which by themselves givc a scparate,purcly lexical dimension of internal cohesion to a text.

# 6.3Lexical relations as cohesive patterns

The most immediately obvious type of lexical cohesion is that illustrated by the Fawn in [6:1o],where the same word is repeated and has thc same referent on both occasions. We have already seen that it is not necessary for the second instancc to bc an exact repetition of the same word; it may be any kind of what we have called REITERATION-synonym, supcrordinate, or general word.We have assumed up to this point, however,that thcrc must be identity of reference between the two,and this suggested that lexical cohesion'was to be interpreted simply as an accompanying feature that may be associated with grammatical reference.

It is not necessary for two lexical occurrences to have the same referent, however, in order for them to be cohesive.Consider the following examples:

[6:11] Why does this little boy have to wriggle all the time? a.Other boys don't wriggle. b.Boys always wriggle. c.Good boys don't wriggle. d.Boys should be kept out of here.

In a), boys ties with boy although they are not coreferential. This could be explained as cohesion by comparative refercnce, in view of the itcm other;but in b there is no identity of rcferencc and no reference itcm either, yet boys still coheres with boy. It would be possible to use a personal reference item InsreAD oF boys here (they always wriggle);this reflects the weak rclation of corefcrence that dces exist betwcen the two- boys refcrs to'all boys'and therefore by implication includcs this littlc boy $\operatorname { I n } \left( c \right)$ however, there is ncither the implication of inclusion nor any form of referencc whatever;yct still thcrc is thc same cohcsive rclation bctwecn boys and boy.Nor is this rclationship in any way dependent on the prescncc of other items suggesting the samc general referential environmcnt;it is not the wriggling that provides thc context, as (d) shows.Many instances of cohesion arc purely lexical, a function simply of the cooccurrencc of lexical itens, and not in any way dependent on the relation ofreferencc.

A lexical item, therefore, cohcrcs with a preceding occurrcnce of the same item whether or not the two have the same referent, or indeed whcthcr or not thcre is any referential relationship bctwccn them.Let us summarize the possibilities with another example.Thc second occurrence may be, as far as reference is concerncd,a IDENTICAL,b) INcLUsIVE, c) ExCLUsIVE Ord) simply UNRELATED.So for example:

[6:12] Thcre's a boy climbing that tree. a.The boy's going to fall if he doesn't take care. b.Thosc boys are always getting into mischicf. c.And there's anothcr boy standing underneath. d.Most boys love climbing trees.

In a the boy has the same rcfercnt as a boy has the refercnce item he could bc used instead. In b) those boys includes the boy referred to previously, and others as well; here we could have a reference item they on the basis of the weak coreferentiality referrcd to in Chapter 2 2.4.1.3) whcre the relation is one of inclusion; $\mathcal { G }$ example [6:1b] above.Inc another boy excludes the boy referrcd to in the first sentence;here there is explicit NoN-identity of reference, and in such instances we cannot have a reference item to rcplacc boy -we can however have a substitute or clliptical form another one or another.In d),most boys bears no rcferential relation at all to the boy previously mentioned;wc cannot gather from d whether the boy in question likes climbing trees or not, and the spcaker does not nccessarily know, or care.This is borne out by the fact that he could make it cxplicit either way,by the use of a particular intonation pattern:

[6:12d.//1 Mosr boys love climbing trees// d//4 Most boys//1LOve climbing trecs// whercd means just as that one does'while $\left( \mathrm { d } ^ { \prime \prime } \right)$ mcans 'whereas I'm not surc about that one'.Characteristically in d), where thcre is no relation of rcference between thc two occurrenccs of boy, thcre is more lexical repctition ovcrall; here not only boy but also climb and tree are repeated,and this compensatcs, as it wcrc, for the lack of any rcfercntial connection.

Properly spcaking,referencc is irrelevant to lexical cohcsion. It is not by virtuc of any referential relation that there is a cohesive force sct up betwecn two occurrences of a lexical item; rather,the cohcsion exists as a direct relation bctween the forms themselves and thus is more like substitution than reference).So for example there is cohesion between the two occurrenccs of wriggle in [6:11a];thc question whether they refer to the samc wriggling is one which, fortunately,does not arise.Compare:

[6:13] a. Henry prescntcd hcr with his own portrait.As it happened, she had always wanted a portrait of Henry. b.Thc Forthright Building Socicty required, apparently, that a borrower should sign, seal and dclivcr thc mortgage deed in the presence of a solicitor, so that thc solicitor would sign it as the witness. This is quite a common requirement.Where a borrower is legally reprcsented, his own solicitor will usually be the witness to thc borrower's execution of the mortgage deed.\*

In (a), the second occurrence of portrait is indcfinitc; but it is still cohesive. The last sentencc in b) contains the items borrower, witness, solicitor and mortgage deed, all of which are repetitions and as such cohere with the carlier occurrences; but the whole discussion is hypothetical and thc question of coreference is simply not applicable, or decidable.

# 6.4 Collocation

We now come to the most problematicalpart of lexical cohcsion,cohesion that is achieved through the association of lexical items that regularly co-occur.

We have seen that lexical reitcration takes place not only through repctition of an identical lcxical item but also through occurrence of a different lexical item that is systematically related to the first one, as a synonym or superordinate of it. This principle applies quite generally, irrespective of whcther or not there is identity of reference; so, for examplc, in [6:11] we could have had children instead of boys throughout and the effect would still have been cohesive.

Furthcrmore,we find that the cohcsive cffect is still present if in place of children we now have girls:

[6:14] Why docs this littlc boy wriggle all the time? Girls don't wriggle.

Girls and boys are hardly synonyns, nor is there any possibility of their having the same referent; they are mutually cxclusive categorics.Yet their proximity in a discourse very definitcly contributes to thc tcxture.

Therc is obviously a systematic rclationship bctween a pair of words such as boy and girl; thcy are relatcd by a particular type of oppositeness, called cOMPLEMENTARITy in Lyons' classification.We can therefore extcnd the basis of thc lexical rclationship that features as a cohesive force and say that there is cohesion bctween any pair of lexical items that stand to cach other in somc recognizable lexicosemantic (word meaning) relation. This would includc not only synonyms and near-synonyms such as clinb...ascentbeam...rafterdisease...illness, and superordinates such as eln... tree boy...childskip ..playbut also pairs of opposites of various kinds, complementarics such as boy...girl, stand up .. sit down antonyms such as like...hatewet...dry crowded...desertedand converses such as order ... obey.

It also includes pairs of words drawn from the same ordered series.For cxample, if Tuesday occurs in onc sentence and Thursday in another, the effect will bc cohesive;similarly dollar...centnorth... southcolonel... brigadier.Likcwise with any pairs drawn from unordered lexical sets, likc basement...roof,road...rail red..green.The members of such sets often stand in some recognizable semantic relation to one another; they may be related as part to whole like car...brake, box...lid or as part to partlike mouth..chinverse..chorus or refrainthcy may be cohyponyms of the same superordinate term, ie both mcmbers of the same more general class, such as chair... table both hyponyms of furniture) walk...drive both hyponyms of go;and so on.

The members of any such sct stand in some kind of semantic relation to one another, but for textual purposes it docs not much matter what this rclation is.Therc is always the possibility of cohesion betwcen any pair of lexical items which are in somc way associated with each other in the language.So we will find a very marked cohesivc cffect deriving from the occurrence in proximity with cach other of pairs such as the following, whose mcaning relation is not casy to classify in systematic semantic termslangh.. jokeblade...sharpgarden...digill...doctor, try...

succeedbee...honcydoor...windowking...crownboat...rowsunshine...cloud.Thc cohesive cffect of such pairs depends not so much on any systcmatic semantic relationship as on thcir tendcncy to share the same lexical environmcnt, to occur in col OcA Tion with one another. In gcneral, any twc lexical itcms having similar pattcrns of collocationthat is, tending to appear in similar contexts -will gcnerate a cohesive force if thcy occur in adjacent scntences.

This effect is not limited to a pair of words.It is very common for long cohcsive chains to bc built up out of lexical relations of this kind, with word patterns like candle...flame...flicker, hair...comb...curl... wavepoetry...literature...reader...writer...style,sky...sunshine.. cloud ..rain wcaving in and out of succcssive sentenccs.Such patterns occur freely both within the same sentence and across sentcncc boundaries; they are largcly indcpendent of thc grammatical structure. Rathcr than citing a numbcr of short passages to illustrate this wc will quote onc long paragraph which is a typically rich rescrve of such collocational cohcsion; note the importance of the title in this regard:

# A RIDE ON AN AVALANCHE

Few Yosemite visitors ever see snow avalanches and fewer still know thc exhilaration of riding on them. In all my mountain\~ eering I have enjoyed only one avalanche ride, and the start was so sudden and thc cnd came so soon I had but little time to think of the danger that attcnds this sort of travel,though at such times one thinks fast.One finc Yosemite morning aftcr a hcavy snowfall, being eager to see as many avalanchcs as possible and wide views of the forest and summit peaks in their new white robes before the sunshinc had time to change them, I set out early to climb by a side canyon to the top of a commanding ridge a little over thrce thousand fect above the Vallcy.On account of thc looseness of the snow that blocked the canyon I knew thc climb woud require a long time,some three or four hours as I estimated; but it proved far more difficult than I had anticipated.Most of the way I sank waist decp almost out of sight in some placcs.After spending thc whole day to within half an hour or so of sundown,I was still several hundred feet bclow the summit. Then my hopes wcre reduced to getting up in time to see thc sunset.But I was not to get sunmit views of any sort that day, for deep trampling near the canyon head,whcrc thc snow was straincd, started an avalanchc, and I was swishcd down to the foot of the canyon as if by enchantment. Thc wallowing ascent had taken ncarly all day, the dcsccnt only about a minute.When thc avalanchc startd I thrcw myself on my back and spread my arnis to try to kccp from sinking.Fortunatcly, though the grade of the canyon is very stcep, it is not interrupted by precipices large enough to causc outbounding or free plunging. On no part of thc rush was I buricd. I was only moderately imbedded on the surface or at tines a little bclow it, and covered with a veil of back-streaming dust particles; and as the whole mass bcneath and about mc joined in the fight therc was no friction, though I was tossed here and thcrc and lurchcd from side to side. Whcn the avalanche swedgcd and came to rest I found myself on top of the crumpled pile without a bruise or scar. This was a fine expcricnce. Hawthorne says somewhere that stcam has spiritualized travel; though unspiritual smells, smoke, etc, still attend steam travel.This fight in what might be called a inilky way of snow-stars was the most spiritual and exhilarating of all thc modcs of motion I have ever experienced. Elijah's fight in a chariot of fire could hardly have been more gloriously exciting.

(from The Yosemite by John Muir 1912)

Examples of chains of collocational cohesion are: mountaineering Yosenite ...sunmit peaks...climb...ridge; hours...whole day. (sundown...sunset...) all day...minute; wallowing...sinking buried...imbedded;ride...riding...ride...travel...travel...travel.. flight...motion...flight.

The analysis and interpretation of lexical patterning of this kind is a major task in the furthcr study of textual cohesion. Hcrc wc shall simply group togcther all the various lexical rclations that do Nor depend on referential idcntity and are Nor of the form of rciteration accompanied by the or a demonstrative-in other words, all lexical cohesion that is not covered by what wc have called reitcration'- and treat it undcr the general heading of colocAtion, or collocational cohesion, without attempting to classify the various meaning relations that are involved. But it should be borne in mind that this is simply a cover term for thc cohesion that results from the co-occurrence of lexical items that arc in some way or other typically associated with one another, becausc they tend to occur in similar environmcnts:the specific kinds of co-occurrence relations are variable and complex, and would havc to be interpreted in thc light of a general semantic description of the English language.\*

# 6.5The general concept of lexical cohesion

The suggested framework for the description of lexical cohesion is as follows:

Typc of lexical cohesion: Refercntial relation:

I.Reiteration

a same word (rcpctition i same referent b synonymor ncar-synonym (ii inclusive csuperordinate (ii) cxclusive d general word (iv) unrelatcd

# 2. Collocation

The effect of lexical, especially collocational, cohcsion on a text is subtle and difficult to estimate.With grammatical cohesion the effect is relatively clear: if one comcs across the word he, for example there is no doubt that some essential information is called for, and that the identity of the he must bc rccovered from somewherc.Rcference items, substitutes and conjunctions all explicitly presupposc some elcmcnt other than themselves.

In lexical cohesion, however,it is not a case of therc being particular lexical items which always have a cohesive function.Every lexical item MAY enter into a cohesivc relation, but by itself it carries no indication whether it is functioning cohesively or not. That can be established only by rcfcrence to the text.

This seems to suggest that what we are calling lexical cohesion carrics no meaning; that it is simply an ncidental consequcnce of thc fact that discourse does not wander at randoin from cne topic to another but runs on reasonably systematic lines with a certain consistcncy of topic and predictability of development. In general, of course, this is truc; most discourse is well organizcd, and the patterned occurrence of lexical iteins is a natural consequencc of this. But this docs not imply that lexical cohesion has no meaning.Without our being aware of it, each occurrence of a lexical itcm carrics with it its own textual history, a particular collocational cnvironment that has been built up in the course of the crcation of thc text and that will provide the contcxt within which the item will be incarnated on this particular occasion. This cnvironmcnt dctermincs the instantial meaningor text meaning, of the item, a meaning which is unique to each spccific instancc.

In reading or listcning to text, we process continuously,and thercfore by the time any given lexical itcm is taken inits context has already been prepared; and the preceding lexical environment is perhaps the most significant component of this context. It frequently provides a grcat deal of hidden information that is relevant to the interprctation of thc item concerned. There are many examplcs of this in the long paragraph from John Muir quotcd above.To consider just onc of these: an inspection of thc collocational cnvironmcnt of thc item sunset shows that it tics with sundown in the preceding sentencc, and less immediatcly,with thc words (long) time ... hours ...(whole) day in thc slightly less immediatc context. Thesc two collocational themes come together in the phrase within half an hour of sundown.This environment defines sunset in the context of timc, as an event preceded by a fixed and limited interval, and sets the stage for thc passage which serves as the immediate environmcnt for sunset, namely in time to see the sunset. The result is twofold.On one hand,when we meet this phrase in tine to see the sunset we intcrpret it with what has gone before in mind, and this defines the uniquc instantial meaning of the word sunset on this occasion.On thc other hand, the fact that we do this has the cffcct of making the word sunset, whcn it docs occur, cohesive with thc related itcms that have preceded it, and hcnce of giving it a significant part in thc creation of texture.

Thc lexical environment of any item includes, naturally,not only thc words that are in some way or other relatcd to it, in the terms discussed in this chapter, but also all other words in the preceding passage, and all of thcsc contributc to its specific interprctation in the given instance.But it is the OCCurrCnce of thc iten IN THE CONTEXT OF RELATED LEXICAL ITEMs that provides cohesion and gives to the passage thc quality of text. The relatedncss is a matter of more or less; there is no clearly dcfined cutoff point such that we can say that sunset for cxample,is reiatcd to just this sct of words and no others.But we can say that it is more closely relatcd to some than to others; and it is the closcness of the rclationship that determines thc cohesive effect.

The relative strength of the collocational tcnsion is rcally a function of two kinds of relatcdness, one kind bcing relatedncss in the linguistic system and the other bcing rclatedncss in the text.What wc arc calling related lexical items arc related in thc linguistic system. In the linguistic system there is a closcr relationship betwccn sunset and sundown than,say, between sunset and day; the lattcr are,in turn, morc closely related than sunset and summit or sunset and mountain,although thcrc is somc rclationship here tooless remotc than say,between sunset and sight or sunset and estimate.There are degrces of proximity in thc lexical system, a function of the relative probability with which onc word tends to co-occur with another.Secondly, in the text thcre is relatedness of another kind, relativc proximity in the simpic sense of thc distance separating onc item from anothcr, the number of words or clauses or sentences in bctwecn. Thc cohesive force that is exerted bctween any pair of lexical items in a passage of discourse is a function of their relative proximity in these two respects.

There is a very close proximity between sunset and sundown as regards thcir relatedness in thc linguistic system;they are morphologically related, both containing the elemcnt sunand thcy arc also near-synonyms, sunset referring to a particular event considered as a pcrceptual phenomcnon, and sundown refcrring to the samc event considercd as defining a moment in timne. If the two occur in adjaccnt sentences, thcy exert a very strong cohesive force;this would be progrcssively weaker thc greater the textual distance between them.

There is a third factor influcncing the cohesivc force between a pair of lexical itcms in a text, and that is their overall frequency in the system of the language. A word which enters with equal readiness into collocation with words of every possible range of lexical meaning cffects relatively little cohesion with any of thcm. Words such as go or nan or know or way can hardly be said to contract significant cohcsive relations, bccause thcy go with anything at all. Sincc, roughly speaking, words of this kind are also those with high ovcrall frequcncy in the language, in general thc highcr the frequency of a lexical item its ovcrall frequency in the system the smaller thc part it plays in lexical cohesion in texts.

When analysing a text in respect of lexical cohesion, the most important thing is to use common scnse, combined with thc knowledge that we have, as speakers of a languagc, of thc nature and structurc of its vocabulary.Wc have a very clear idea of the relative frcquency of words in our own languagc,and a ready insight if we do not subnierge it bencath thc weight of thc demand for formal procedures of analysis into what constitutes a significant pattcrn and what docs not. In assessing the lexical cohesion of a text wc can safely ignore, as wc ccrtainly would do without cven thinkingabout it, rcpctitive occurrences of fully gramnatical (closed systcm) items likc pronouns and prcpositions and verbal auxiliarics, and also of lexical items of very high frcquency like take and do and good and the others mentioned above. An cxception to this appcars just whcn such words occur in special scnses with restricted patterns of collocation; for cxample takings in the sense of earnings, or good in a specifically moral context. Again, common sense needs to bc brought into play.There is likely to bc no significant cohesion bctween two occurrenccs of good of which onc is in a moral sense and the other an exclamation meaning agree'whereas therc might bc quite a significant tie between the first of thcsc and a diffcrcnt but related word such as virthe or judgment.

In the coding scheme suggested in Chapter 8, we have used a single heading for all instances of collocational cohesion, making no differentiation cither according to thc different kinds of collocational relation or according to different degrees of cohesivc forcc.A full interprctation of lexical cohcsion would require furthcr differcntiation on both thesc counts: but such a treatment dcmands a separate study and is beyond our scope here.

Therc remains one point to be added to round off this limited discussion of lexical cohcsion. A lexical item is not bound to a particular grammatical category, or to a particular morphological form.For example, there is just one lexical itcm boy, which has thc forms boy, boys boys and boys. Similarly talk, talks, talked and talking all rcprcsent a single lexical item talk.There arc no perfectly clear criteria for deciding just how far this principle can be extcndcd.For cxamplc, gogoes goinggone and went are all one lexical itcm and so are good better and best; so also presumably arc noun and (where these have thc scnse of'noun) nominal, nominalize and noninalization.Rather morc doubtful are pairs likc tooth and dental, map and cartographic town and urban even more doubtful, perhapsa set such as young, youth and juvenile.In the last rcsort it does not much matter, since such scts and pairs are cohesive anyway;but it is often possible to bc guided by the context - the doubtful cases are gcncrally doubtful precisely because thcy are sometimes the same word and sometimes not, so that pairs likc tooth and dental may be used cither as morphological variants of the same lexical item or as different lexical items.This, like many other linguistic points, is well brought out by forms of linguistic humour. an expression like the archiepiscopal gaiters is playing on the fact that archiepiscopal can be interpreted as simply a morphological variant of the item archbishop,although usually it functions as a rclated but separate item.On the other sidc of the line would be pairs likc starve and hunger, or disease and ill, which are rclated by synonyny but probably never treated as forms of the same word.

Thc conccpt of the lexical item therefore,is not totally clcarcut; likc most linguistic categories, although clearly defincd in thc idcal, it prcsents many indctcrminacies in application to actual instances.Despitc this indeterminacy-and it may be remarkcd that the term LExicAL ITM is rathcr less indeterminatc than the folk-linguistic term woRD-it is an essential concept for the undcrstanding of text.Howevcr luxuriant the grammatical cohesion displaycd by any piece of discourse, it will not form a text unless this is matched by cohesive patterning of a lcxical kind.

A final example:

[6:16] Sing a song of sixpence, a pocket full of rye, Four-and-twcnty blackbirds bakcd in a pie, When thc pic was opened, the birds began to sing, Wasn't that a dainty dish to set before a king? The king was in his counting-house, counting out his moncy, The queen was in the parlour, cating brcad and honey, The maid was in the garden, hanging out the clothes. Along came a blackbird and pecked off her nose.

There is reitcration of the same word,eg pie ...pieking..king; of a near-synonym,eg: eating...peckedof a superordinate, egpie...dish, sixpence...money,blackbird...bird dish might perhaps also bc interpreted as a general word in thc modern senseanything nicc';cf: dishy).There is also collocational cohcsion, eg:king...qucenparlour...garden dish.. eat,rye...bread.Thc rhyme provides a good illustration of the amount of lexical cohesion,and the varied nature of lexical cohesion, that is characteristic of even a very short text.\*

# The meaning of cohesion

# 7.1Text

In Chaptcr I wc discussed what was mcant by IExt,and introduced the concept of cohcsion to refer to the linguistic mcans whereby texture is achievcd. In this chapter we resumc thc discussion in the light of thc account that has been given of thc various typcs of cohesion in English.

A text, wc have suggested, is not just a string of sentences. In othcr words it is not simply a large grammatical unit, something of the samc kind as a sentence but differing from it in size - a sort of supersentence. A text is best thought of not as a grammatical unit at all, but rather as a unit of a different kind: a scmantic unit. The unity that it has is a unity of meaning in context, a texturc that expresses the fact that it relates_as a whole to the environment in which it is placed.

Bcing a scmantic unit,a text is REALizeD in the form of scntcnccsand this is how thc rclation of text to sentence can best bc interprcted. A set of rclated sentences,with a single scntence as the liniting casc, is the embodiment or realization of a text. So the exprcssion of the scmantic unity of the text lies in the cohcsion among the scntences of which it is composed.

Typically,in any text,cvcry scntence except thc first exhibits some form of cohesion with a prcceding sentence, usually with the one immediately preceding.In othcr words, evcry sentence contains at least one anaphoric tie connecting it with what has gone before.Some sentences may also contain a cataphoric tie, connecting up with what follows; but these are very much rarcr, and are not necessary to the creation of text.

Any piccc of language that is opcrational, functioning as a unity in some context of situation, constitutes a text. It may be spokcn or written, in any stylc or gcnre, and involving any number of active participants.It will usually display a form of consistency that is defined by thc concept of register:a consistcncy in the mcaning styles or types of semantic configuration which embody its relation to its.environmcnt. In othcr words,a text is usually rcasonably homogeneous, at lcast in thosc linguistic aspects which most closely refect and express its functional relationship to its setting.

# 7.1.1 Length of text

Text may be of any length.Since it is not a unit of the grammatical rank scalc, and does not consist of sentences, it is not ticd to the sentence as its lower limit. Many familiar texts in fact come out as lcss than one scntence in the grammatical structure.Warnings, titles, announccments, inscriptions and advertising slogans often consist of a verbal, nominal, adverbial or prepositional group only,for examplc

[7:1] a.No smoking b. Site of carly chapel c.For sale d.National Westminster Bank c.Donot feed

Equally, therc is no uppcr limit on the lcngth of the text. An cntire book may, and in many genrcs such as fiction typically does, comprise a single text; this is what is implied in the terma novel'.The same is true of a play, a scrmon, a lccture, or a committec meeting.

The type of presupposition that provides texture in thc tcxt, in other words what we arc calling cohesion, can extend over very long sequcnces. We find in cveryday convcrsation clements turning up which presuppose carlier passages from which they arc scparated by many minutes and even hours of spcaking time; and writers cxploit this potcntial by making cohesive ties across very long stretches of text. It is clear that the awareness of tcxt that we develop as part of the learning of the mother tongue is rathcr frec from constraints of time, and depends much more on contextual relcvance and intcgration of thc language with the cnvironment.

# 7.1.2 Definitiveness of the concept of text

It would bc misleading to suggest that the concept of a text is fully determinate, or that we can always make clear dccisions about what constitutes a single text and what does not. We can often say for certain that the wholc of a given passagc constitutes onc tcxt; and equally we can often say for certain that in another instancc we have to dcal with not one text but two, or morc.But there are very many intermcdiate cases, instances of doubt where wc are not at all sure whether we want to consider all the parts of a passage as falling within the same text or not.

Usually for practical purposes this does not matter very much. Wc are all intuitively aware of thc validity of thc general conccpt of a text;we know that there is such a thing,whcther or not cvcry instance can bc unambiguously identified.What we react to, as speakers and listeners, readers and writers, in forming judgments about texturc, is prccisely thc sort of cohesive structure the dctails of which we have been exploring in the preccding chapters.

Since the_speaker or writer uses cohesion to signal texturcand.thc listcner or reader rcacts to it in his interpretation of texturc,it is reasonablc for us to make usc of cohesion as a criterion for the rccognition of the boundarics of a text.For most purposes, wc can consider that a ncw text begins whcrc a sentcncc shows no cohesion with those that have prc-- ceded.

Of course, wc shall often find isolated scntences or other structural units which do not cohcrc with thosc around them, cven though they form part of a connccted passage.But usually if a sentence shows no cohesion with what has gone beforc, this does indicatc a transiticn of some kind; for examplc,a transition between different stages in a complex transaction, or bctween narration and description in a passage of prose fiction.We might choosc to regard such instances as discontinuities, signalling thc beginning of a new text.Sometimcs then the ncw text will turn out to be an interpolation as in [1:8] and [1:9] in Chapter I, aftcr which the original text is once again resumed.

So although the concept of a text is cxact cnough, and can be adequately and explicitly defined, the definition will not by itsclf provide us with automatic criteria for recognizing in all instances what is a text and what is not. In all kinds of linguistic contcxts, from the most formal to the most informal, we constantly havc to do with forms of interaction which lie on the borderlinc between tcxtual continuity and discontinuity.But the existencc of indeterminate instances of this kind docs not invalidate or destroy the uscfulness of the gencral notion of text as the basic semantic unit of linguistic interaction.

# 7.1.3 Tight and loose texture

Thc frequcnt shift between narrative and versc in Alice provides an excellent illustration of thc kind of transition that takes place betwecn subtexts within a text.The vcrses are often quitc outsidc thc context of the narrative, and function as independent tcxts in thcir own right; they display no cohesion with what has prcccded them.An example is The Queen of Hearts in thc final chaptcr of Alice in Wonderland.

At the samc tine the verses arc often anticipated by some reference to poctry or song, or to the poem or song in question, so that the verse tcxt as a whole is placcd in an environment not unlike that of quoted speech.Here is an example:

[7:2]The picce I am going to repeat[Humpty Dumpty] went on without noticing her remark,was written entirely for your amusemcnt.' Alice felt that in that case she rcally ought to listen to it, so she sat down and said,Thank you'rather sadly. In winter when thc ficlds are white, I sing this song for your dclight -.

Here there is lexical cohesion: song ties with piece in the first scntcncc and this in turn with poetry occurring a short whilc carlicr.

This gives a fair indication of somcthing that is a gcncral feature of texts of all kinds. Textuality is not a natter of all or nothing,of dense clusters of cohcsive ties or elsc none at all. Characteristically we find variation in texturc, so that textuality is a matter of more or less.In some instances there will in fact be dense clusters of cohesive ties giving a very close texture which serves to signal that the meanings of the parts are strongly interdependent and that the whole forms a singlc unity.

In other instances,however, the texture will bc much looscr.Thcre will be fewer cohesive tiespcrhaps just onc or two. In Alice this alternation between tight and loosc texture givcs a very definite flavour to the whole. At one lcvel, thc wholc of Alice is very much a single text. But when.we shift our focus of attcntion we find that it contains portions that are less closely knit with thc remainder,particularly the songs and the verses, And this is signalled by the relative cohesive independence of these from the surrounding passages - usually,however,a partial not a total independence.

Such a thing is typical of texts of many kinds. Some writers in particular seem to achieve a sort of periodic rhythm in which there is a rcgular alternation bctween tight and loose texture. In this connection wc see thc importancc of the paragraph. The paragraph is a dcvice introduced into the written language to suggest this kind of pcriodicity.In principle we shall expect to find a greater degree of cohesion within a paragraph than betwecn paragraphs; and in a great dcal of writtcn English this is exactly what wc do find. In othcr writing,howcver, and perhaps as a characteristic of ccrtain authors, the rhythm is contrapuntal: thc writer extends a dense cluster of cohesivc ties.across the paragraph boundary and Icaves the texture within the paragraph relatively loose. And this itself is an instance of a process that is very charactcristic of languagc altogether, a process in which two associated variables come to be dissociated from each other with a vcry definite semantic and rhetorical effcct.Herc the two variables in qucstion arc the paragraph structure and the cohcsive structure. Thc paragraph evolves first of all-as the written symbol or representation of a periodic pattern that we might represent in the following way:

![](img/5d1abe3ee68eebd8dda89db97ad34698e3c75d46c1c58e2885afa201bad64c5a.jpg)

The vertical lincs reprcsent the paragraph boundarics and the wavy line represents the density of cohesive tics.Subsequently however thc paragraph comes to function as a pattern maker as distinct from bcing merely a pattern narkcr) in its own right, and something like thc following picture emerges:

![](img/e107bdcb0854d04236db8b82e24191a7e7b3ea11b16eb4cf9909d5fa9d6ed98a.jpg)

This represents thc sort of writing in which thc paragraph structure is played off against the cohesion, giving a complex texture in which the rhythm of the eye (and associated bodily rhythms of rcading) is balanced against the rhythm that is cngendered by the alternation between tightness and looseness of cohesive patterning.

# 7.1.4Imaginary texture

Finally we may mention the type of cohesion which imposes an imaginary texture, by setting up expectations in the reader or listener which since they are expectations of the past, by thcir nature, can not be satisfied. Alice will again serve as an example.

Thc vcry first sentence of Through the Looking Glass is [7:3] Onc thing was certain, that the whitc kitten had had nothing to do with it-it was the black kitten's fault entirely.

This sentence is clearly marked as cohesive, by the occurrcnce of the reference item it. In other words,thc narrative begins as if one was already in thc middle of it; it appcars to presuppose a great deal that has gone before,but in fact nothing has gone bcfore so wc have to supply it for ourselves.Our intcrest is inmcdiately engagcd,sincc we incvitably start searching for some interpretation of the it. In this instancc the reference, as often, is rcsolved cataphorically; we learn two paragraphs later that it refers to unwinding and entangling a ball of wool.

This devicc is commonly exploited in the opcning of short stories, wherc it sets the tone for a genre whosc meaning as a genre depcnds on the implications that what is in the text is not the whole story.It is also used in other contexts; the example was quoted in Chaptcr 1 1.1.2 of the radio comedian who began his patter with the words so we pushed him under the other one.

This type of false or unrcsolved cohesion creatcs an effect of solidarity with the hearcr or reader. It puts him on the inside, as one who is assumed to have shared a common expcrience with the speaker or writer.In its use in writtcn fiction it is perhaps akin to thc typical beginning of an oral folk narrative, which assumes prior knowledge of the matter of thc tale on the part of thc audience and makes allusion to the charactcrs, the events or the circumstantial background in a form which often looks anaphoric, although there has been no previous mention, at least on thc occasion in qucstion.Similar propertics are found in the oral narratives of young childrcn, which presuppose a sharing of cxpcriencc with the listencr.The line betwccn real and imaginary anaphora is not, aftcr all, very clcarcut; a great deal of news rcporting depcnds for its intcrpretation on the assumption that thc previous day's newspaper was part of the samc text. And what is one tcxt for one participant in a situation may not always be so for another, as appears whcn a pcrson who has been day-dreaming suddenly voiccs one of his thoughts aloud.

# 7.2 The general meaning of cohesion

The general mcaning of cohesion is cmbodied in the concept of text. By its role in providing tcxture' cohesion helps to create text. Cohcsion is a necessary though not a sufficient condition for thc creation of text.What creates text is the TEx ruALor tcxt-formingcomponent of the linguistic system, of which cohesion is one part.The textual component as,a whole is the set of resources in a language whose semantic function is that of cxprcssing rclationship_to thc cnvironment.It is the mcaning dcrived from this component which characterizes a tcxtwhich charactcrizes language that is opcrational in somc context, as distinct from language that is not opcrational but citational, such as an index or other form of verbal inventory.

Thc textual componcnt, and the place of cohesion within it, was discussed briefly in Chapter 1. The concept of a textual or text-forming function in the scmantic system provides the most general answer to the question of what cohesion means. The textual component creates text as opposed to non-tcxt, and thcrcin lies its mcaning.Within the tcxtual componcnt cohcsion plays a spccial role in the creation of text.Cohesion cxpresses thc continuity that exists between one part of the text and another. It is important to stress that continuity is not thc whole of texture. The organization of each scgment of a discoursc in terms of its information structurc, thematic pattcrns and the like is also part of its texturc see 7.4.1 bclow),no lcss important than the continuity from onc scgment to another. But the continuity adds a further clement that must be present in order for the discoursc to comc to life as text.

The continuity that is providcd by cohesion consists, in the most gencral terms, in cxprcssing at each stage in the discourse the points of contact with what has gone before.The significance of this lies in thc simple fact that there are such points of contact: that some entity or some circumstance, some relevant featurc or some thread of argument persists from onc moment to another in the semantic process, as the meanings unfold. But it has another more fundamental significancc, which lies in the interpretation of the discourse. It is the continuity provided by cohesion that enables thc reader or listencr to supply all the missing pieces, all the components of the picture which arc not present in the text but arc necessary to its interpretation.

One of the major problems in undcrstanding linguistic interactionit is actually a problem in the understanding of AlL text processes, whcther those of dialoguc or others, though it is usually poscd in thc context of dialogue-is that of knowing how the listener fills in the missing information. The listener assigns meanings and interprets what is said to him; but in doing so hc is himself supplying a grcat deal of the interpretation. The sentences and clauses and words that he hears, however perfectly formed lexicogrammatically (and, contrary to a popular belicf, in most spcech contexts they are very wcll formed indeed),are semantically full of holcs.Or rathcr,this is the wrong mctaphor.The situation is sometimes reprcsented as if there were omissions which the listener had to supplement;as if the semantics of discoursc was likc a jigsaw puzzle with missing picces in it. It would bc more appropriate to describe it in terms of focus. What the lexicogrammar of thc text presents is more like a picture that is complete but out of focus, with the outlines blurred and thc dctails imperceptible. And if we take one furthcr step and postulatc that the picture to start with was not a photographic likeness but a symbolic representation,then we shall get somc idca of the naturc of the decoding process-for that is what it is-that the listener goes through.

What makes it possiblc for him to go through the process is the fact that what he hears is systematically related to its cnvironment-it has 'textual meaning, as we have cxpressed it; and an cssential conponent in this rclationship is its continuity with what has preccded.Thc continuity is not mcrcly an interesting feature that is associatcd with tcxt; it is a necessary clement in the interpretation of text. Therc has to be cohesion if meanings are to be exchanged at all.

This is so casy to illustrate that it is often forgotten.Consider the examples that have been cited throughout this book. The vast majority of them have been cither drawn from Alice in Wonderland or made up. Why?This is the only way to cnsure that attention would bc focused on the point at issue:either to use a tcxt that is so familiar that the rcader will not pause over its interpretation,or to construct examples that are so artificial that thcy avoid the problem.If we had taken isolated sentcnces from real-life texts, they would have looked something like the following:

[7:4] a. Two rolled off it and stoppcd, as though arrested by a witch's wand, at Mrs Oliver's feet. b.This is a one with animals too, animals that go in water. c. Administration spokesmen were prompt to say it should not be considered any such thing. d.You could see them coming on him, beforc your very cycs. e.I expcct you will get this but I'll scnd it if you want. f.It was thc morning caught for cver. g.So he proposed having his discovery copicd beforc parting with it.

These are typical examples of what pcople say and write-cxcept that they do not say or write them in isolation. In interpreting thcm, we build in, along with other environmental factors, thc continuity clement; we do not even noticc the indeterminacies and all thc differcnt meanings we could read in because the lens is alrcady in place bcforc thc picture comes along to bc interpreted.But the process of interpretation goes on, and thc pattcrns of cohcsion have playcd a central part in it.

Thc point is perhaps obvious enough. But we often fail to realize just how much of our intcrpretation dcpends on this continuity with what has gone before. It is not only the rcferents that we havc to supply -the meaning of two and it in athis in b)it in cthen and him in dthis in (e)it in (f)hc in gNor is it simply information of the kind that is demanded by the too in (b)the such in (c or thc so in (g)in addition to what?'any thing such as what?',why did hc proposc having it done? Taking thcse sentences by themselves we havc no idea, or rather we havc only the haziest idea how to interpret thc things- the objects, events and so forth - that are encoded in the grammatical structures and the lexical items. What kind of rolling took placc? What does with mean, in with animals? In what ways are things coming on hin? What can be made of you will get this but I'll send it? What sort of discovery is to be copicd, how, and why? Wc cannot begin to visualize the morning, and we do not know whethcr it is a morning that has been mentioned before or onc that is to be idcntified exophorically, as uniquc or at least recognizable under the circumstances. We do not know whethcr the spokesmen for the Administration are talking about an objcct, an institution or a lcngthy passage of text - a fact or report. There is nothing unusual or mysterious about any of these examples; but thcy are out of focus, and will click into placc only when we put them in their textual environment and satisfy the querics which thcy arouse.

It is hardly neccssary to do this in order to demonstrate the point at issuc.However, thc reader may fcel deccived if nothing further is said, so here is the immediatcly preceding co-text for each of the above examples:

(a) Joyce, a sturdy thirtcen-year-old, scized thc bowl of apples.   
(b) This mobile's got fishes, yours has aninals.   
(c) During the hearing on Wedncsday, Inouye said the questions furnished by Buzhardt should scrve as a substitute, admittedly not the very best, but a substitutc for cross-examination of Mr Dean by the Presidcnt of the United States   
d Spots.All over his facc and hands  
(e) Nothing else has come for you except Staff Bulletin no 2.   
(f) Therc on the rough thick papcr, reduced to their simplest possible terms,werc the strcam, glittering and dimpling,the stonc arch of thc bridgc flushed in morning sunlight, the moor and the hills.   
(g The noblcman, it appeared, had by this timc bccomc rather fond of Nanna and Pippa.He likcd, it night be said, the way they comported themsclves.

Anything approaching a full' interpretation is likcly to need much more information than is recoverable from a preceding scntence or two. For cxample, in the text containing (g), two pages earlicr, was the sentence It was a highly indecent picture.

Preceding a),at intervals, there have occurrcd It was to be a Halloween party ...and Mrs Oliver was partial to apples.Moreover thc whole text has, in turn, been prcceded by other tcxts containing accounts of Mrs Oliver and hcr fondness for apples, as well as associated refercnces to witchcraft. In the same way (c) has been preceded not only by six columns of dctailed news but by six months of almost daily reporting centring around the Watergatc affair. In d) the chaotic absence of cohesion is used as a comic device to suggest information being extracted from someone against his will, though in fact (as the audicnce knows from the preceding text) the reluctance is fcigned and the information is false:

Patch: Mind you, San, it may not be that at all. We can't tell what poor old Slivers has got  
Mellock Who's Slivers? [As they do not replyGrindley shaking his head at PatchUrsula cuts in.]   
Ursula: Is he thc man you had lockcd in that cabin?[As they do not reply] He is, isn't he? [They nod.] Well.what's the matter with him?   
Patch: It was the only thing we could do you know.Until the doctor came.   
Mellock not liking this]:The doctor?   
Ursula: Comc on. What's the matter with him? [They are obviously reluctant to answer.] He was taken ill, wasn't he?

Cohesive ties, cspecially those with the immediatcly preccding text, are only onc source for thc information that the reader or listener rcquircs.Both situational and more temote textual information afe necessary componcnts.But it is surprising how much can often be recovcred simply from the prcsuppositions carricd by the cohcsivc elements. The ongoing continuity of discourse is a primary factor in its intelligibility.

This illustrates the meaning of cohesion as a whole. It providcs, for the text, which is a scmantic unit, thc sort of continuity which is achieved in units at thc grammatical Icvel -the sentcncc, the clause and so onby grammatical structure.Like everything else in the semantic system, cohesive relations are realized through the lexicogrammar, by the sclection of structurcs, and of lexical itcms in structural roles.Our intention in this book has been to survey the lexicogrammatical resources in question, and show their place in the linguistic system.But the cohesive rclations themselves are relations in mcaning, and thc continuity which they bring about is a semantic continuity.This is what makes it possible for cohesive patterns to play the part they do in the processing of text by a listener or a reader, not merely signalling the presence and extent of text but actually enabling him to interpret it and determining how he docs so.

# 7.3 The meaning of different kinds of cohesion

Wc have discussed cohesion under the five headings of reference, substitution, cllipsis, conjunction and lexical cohesion. Thc classification is based on linguistic form; thcse arc the categorics of cohesion that can be recognized in the lexicogrammatical system. In terms of the resources which are brought into play, they arc all lexicogrammatical phenomena of one kind or another.

Referencc, substitution and cllipsis are clearly grammatical, in that they involve closed systems: simple options of presence or abscnce, and systems such as those of person, number, proximity and dcgrce of comparison. Lexical cohesion is, as the name implies, lexical; it involves a kind of choice that is open-ended, thc selection of a lexical itcm that is in somc way related to one occurring previously.Conjunction is on the borderline of the grammatical and the lexical; thc sct of conjunctive elemcnts can probably be interpreted grammatically in tcrms of systems, but such an interpretation would bc fairly complex, and some conjunctivc expressions involve lexical selcction as well, eg:moment in from that moment on.

This tells us about what form cohcsion takes what resources of the linguistic system are drawn on in the expression of cohcsive rclations.But it does not tell us about thosc relations themselves.If we ask what is the NATuRE of cohesivc relations,as distinct from what form of ExpREssION they take, we get a different answer -one still in terms of the linguistic system, but giving a different kind of explanation.Wc arc now asking about the nature of cohesion considcred as a set of relations in language; whereabouts in thc linguistic system are thcsc relations located? In other words, what do thc different kinds of cohcsion mean?

If we look at cohesion from this point of vicw, we shall bc able to recognize three kinds. Thcsc are the three diffcrent kinds of rclation in language,other than the rclation of structure, that link one part of a text with another. In the most gcneral terms they arc I rclatedness of form,

2relatedness of reference,3semantic conncction

The way these correspond to the various types of cohcsion is as follows:

Nature of cohesive relation: Relatedness of form

Typc of cohesion: Substitution and ellipsis; lexical collocation Reference; lexica! rciteration Conjunction

Relatedness of reference Semantic connection

# 7.3.1 General principles behind the different types

We have referred to aspects of this general picture at various places in the discussion. It has been pointed out that reference, while it is cxpressed by grammatical mcans, is actually a semantic relation, a rclation between meanings of particular instances rather_than between words or other items of linguistic form.Substitution and ellipsis, on the other hand, are formal relations between clements at the lexicogrammatical level.

It has also been shown that various consequcnces follow from this distinction. In substitution and cllipsis it is always possible to restore the presupposed item replacing the substitution counter, or filling out the empty structural slot);in reference, typically, it is not.On thc othcr hand a substitute has to prescrve thc grammatical function of thc prcsupposed item;whereas there is no such rcstriction on reference,which is independent of this sort of formal constraint. Lexical cohesion has something of both types.The relation itself is a formal oncbetween itcms of the vocabulary irrespective of any rcferential identity; but lexical cohcsion is typically uscd in contexts where there is identity of rcference, and for this rcason thc cohering lexical itcm is usually accompanied by the, or other anaphoric reference item.

Why thesc two different types of cohcsive relation, onc formal the other semantic? This can bc explaincd by the fact that thcrc are two possible channels for thc recovery of information: thc situation, and thc text.

The concept of siruATion was discussed in Chapter 2. It is a very simple notion, designed to account for the fact that language takes place in social contexts and makes conncctions with thc realities that makc up thosc contexts. The relevant realities are by no means necessarily to be found in the surrounding stage properties, the furniture of the matcrial cnvironment. A social context is a much more abstract conception, a kind of scmiotic structure within which meaning takcs place; the'realities' of which it is made up may bc of an entirely intangible kind.But equally they may rcside in thc pcrsons and thc objects that figure in the immediate vicinity; and if so,reference will havc to be made to them.This is what we have called cxophoric reference.

The semantic levcl in the linguistic system is, among other things, an interface between language and the realities of the outside world. So the cxophoric connections with the environment are connections made at the semantic level. This accounts for reference. Reference is a semantic relation linking an instance of language to its environmcnt, and reference items are in principle exophoric. The basic meaning of hin is that man out thereWe can see this clearly in the first and sccond pcrson forms me and you, which refer to thc roles of speaker and addrcssce in thc communication situation; and also in the demonstratives with their system of proximity,near mcthis or not ncar me'that)with sometimes a third term not near cither of us(yon)as in

[7:5]Yon Cassius hath a lean and hungry look.

Secondly, in any connected passage of discourse it will bc nccessary to refer back to somcthing that has been mentioncd already, making cxplicit the fact that therc is identity of rcfcrence between the two. There is still, no doubt, an ultimate refcrent bcyond the language, which dcfines the nature of the identity bctween the two instances.But thc immediate referent of the second instancc is the first instance; and it is this immediate referent, the prcvious mention, that now constitutes the relevant environment,not thc cxtralinguistic referent.Probably,all languages adapt thcir refcrence items to this functionextending thcm from exophoric to endophoric use.(This formulation is not intcnded to imply that such a development has taken place in the known history of languagcs,but rather that it is a devclopment that has probably taken place in the evolution of human Ianguage as a whole.) Thus in English nearly all reference items are also regularly cndophoric.In those types of situation in which thc pcrceptual cnvironment is not part of thc relevant social context,uscs of language which arc far removed from language in action', cndophoric refcrence takes prcccdence over exophoric as a mcans of establishing identity.In this way the process of idcntification of thc referent becomes a cohesive or text-forming process.

Why do we refer to John as him rathcr than as John?Bccause John is vague, whereas hin is.definitc. John could bc any old John; but him means that particular individual whose identity wc have cstablished and agreed upon.We rcfer to John as hin rather than as John in order to signal that his idcntity is a feature of the environment. And the same principlc applies to the othcr refcrence items. Thc environment has bccn cxtended from the situation to include the tcxt.

In that case if the relation of refcrencc may bc endophoric as well as cxophoric-if a rcfcrence item can refer to an element in the text as well as to an element in the situation-we may wcll ask why languages have evolved a second relation of a different kind,that of substitution, to relate onc linguistic item to another.Hcre the key to the answcr lies in the concept of contrast, in the scnse of contrastive information. In connccted discoursc therc are very many occasions where we need to rcpeat some item preciscly where there is no identity of rcference.For example

[7:6 Would you like this teapot? -No,I want a square one.

Hcre thc second speaker docs not usc thc refercnce item it, becausc hc does not, in fact, want the object referred to.But he does establish continuity of a diffcrcnt kind, onc based not on referential identity in the given instance but on the idcntity of the linguistic elemcnts involved.The continuity lics not in the mcaning but in the form.The use of the substitute one means 'supply the lcxical item that just figured as Hcad of the nominal group'Thc relation between thc two instances is a relation established at the lexicogrammatical level.

It is not, of course, without its semantic aspect; but the semantic implication is of a different kind.Thc gcncral class of objects, in this case tcapotsconstitutes the link between thc two.But the significance of thc continuity that is cstablished by the use of thc substitute is that it is continuity in thc cnvironment of contrast.Example [7:6] is a typical instance of cohesion through substitution, whcre the meaning is a non-identical mcmbcr of the identical class'.

The contrast may take many differcnt forms. The meaning nonidentical mcmbcr of the idcntical class'is merely onc that is characteristically associatcd with the use of the nominal substitute one. But the contrast may be in any of the systems associated with the element in which substitution occurs.With the nominal substitutc, it may bc found in thc Deictic or Numcrative clcmcnt as wcll as in thc Epithct; whilc a verbal substitute is typically accompanicd by a contrast in polarity,in mood or in modality.

In ordcr to express this sort of continuity in the environment of contrast, the cohcsive rclation that is appropriate is one that is established not at the semantic level, where there is an implication that the cohesive factor is an extralinguistic one, but at the lcxicogrammatical level. Hcrc the implication is that thc continuity is essentially a linguistic continuity, that lies in the words themselves: the meaning of substitution is this is the same word that we had beforeIt is thus inherently a textual, not a situational relation, and is used in cxophoric contexts only with a special effect that of creating the illusion that the presupposed item has occurred before.

We have used the formulation contrast or contrastive information to draw attention to thc special fcature which distinguishes substitution from refcrence. This might suggest that there is always some negation involved:not what was referred to previously, but a diffcrent one, etc).This is the typical form that thc contrast takes;but it is not the only form. Consider an cxample such as

[7:7] I want three teapots. I'll take this one, and this onc, and this one.

Here the contrast simply takes the form of new information; we are talking about teapots (one), and the tcapot in question not specified before, is now being specified (this). In cllipsis, which as we have secn is closcly related to substitution, this is the usual interpretation; for cxample [7:8]What are you doing?- Buying a tcapot.

Here the ellipsis of I am displays the continuity and the remainder is thereby signalled as new information. Likcwise:

[7:9]How many teapots are you buying?-Threc.

This is the general principle undcrlying the difference between reference, on thc one hand, and substitution on the other Rcfcrence is a semantic relation,in which a meaning is specified through thc identification of a referentthc source of idcntification is the situation, so that the rclation of reference is basically an cxophoric onc. It becomes incidentally cohcsive, when the identification is mediatcd through the prescnce of a verbal refercnt in the preceding text; this then becomes the prcsupposed element, and the text replaces thc situation as the relevant cnvironment within which the relation of rcfercnce is established.

Substitution/ellipsis is a formal lexicogrammatical relation, in which a form word or words is spccificd through the use of a grammatical signal indicating that it is to be recovered from what has gone bcforc. The source of recovery is the text, so that the relation of substitution is basically an endophoric one. It is inherently cohesivc, since it is the preceding text that provides the relevant environment in which the presupposed item is located.

Conjunction, the third and final type of cohesive relation, differs from both of these in that it is cohcsive not by continuity of form or reference but by scmantic connection.Some relation is establishcd betwcen the meanings of two continuous passages of tcxt, such that the interpretation of the second is dependent on thc rclation in which it stands to the first. This relation may be one of two kinds;either it is prcscnt in the ideational meanings,as a relation between things-for examplc between two events in a narrative; or it is prcscnt in the interpersonal meanings, as a relation between elemcnts or stages in the communication process - for example between two steps in an argumcnt. Eithcr of these may bc reprcscnted as a form of semantic connection bctwccn a pair of adjacent clauscs; the former as in [7:10a], the latter as in [7:10b]:

[7:10] a. Jack fell down and broke his crown. And Jill came tumbling after. b.For he's a jolly good fellow. And so say all of us.

A bricf further discussion of each of the three types of cohesion is given in the following three subsections.

# 73.2Reference

Reference is the relation betwecn an element of the text and somcthing. clse by reference to which it is intcrprcted in the given instance.Refcrence is a potentially cohcsive relation becausc the thing that serves as the source of thc interpretation may itseif be an clcment of text.

A reterence tem is onc whose interprctation is determined in this way. The interpretation takes one of two forms. Either the referencc iten.   
is interpreted through being IDENrIriED wITH the refcrcnt in qucstion;   
or it is interpreted through being coMPARED wITH thc referent - explicitly   
not idcntified with it, but brought into some form of comparison with it.

In thc former case, whcre the interprctation involves identifying, thc referencc itcm functions as a Deictic and is always specific. Deixis is thc identifying function in the nominal group; and for cohesive purposes thc identification must bc specific. Hencc the set of referencc itcms includes all the specific deictics (pronouns and determiners) exccpt thc intcrrogatives. The interrogatives cannot be cohesive since thcy contain only a REQUest FOR specification, not thc specification itself.

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td colspan="3">Personal</td><td rowspan="2">Demonstrative</td></tr><tr><td>Exis- tential</td><td colspan="2">Possessive</td></tr><tr><td>Refer- ential</td><td>I, you, we,he, she,it, they,one</td><td>mine,yours,ours hishers,(its), theirs</td><td>myyourour his herits their one&#x27;s</td><td>the this,these that those</td></tr><tr><td>Inter- rogative</td><td>who what</td><td>whose</td><td>whose</td><td>which,what</td></tr><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Specific pronouns</td><td colspan="2">Specific determiners</td></tr></table></body></html>

In other words, all reference items of this type are specific, because thcir interpretation depends on identity of rcfcrcnce.This docs not imply that the referent, where it is itsclf an elemcnt of thc text ie where the rcfcrence is anaphoric), must neccssarily also be specific.A rcfcrence item can relate anaphorically to any element whether specific or not; for example

[7:11] I can sec a light. Let's followit.

where it refers to a light. But the spccificity is conferred by the reference relation. Since this involves identity, a light' thereby bccomes the light ie the light that was just mentioned-- and specified in the process, so here thc light that (I've said I can sec'.This is why it is possible to have sentences suchas:

[7:12] Nobody cver bclicves he's going to lose.

whcre he means the pcrson bcing considercd as an instancc, here the person whosc belief is in qucstion' In this case the presupposed itcm is not onlv non-spccificit is also bcing said to be non-existent.

A considerable amount is now known about the rules of pronominalization, in the scnse of personal rcfcrencc within the scntence; but this is not a cohesive phcnomenon and lics outsidc our scope. The question of the interpretation of rcfcrence itcms in contexts of potential ambiguity has also bcgun to bc studicd,and this, though not our primary concern here, does nccd to be briefy mentioned. Herce the question is, how docs thc listener or reader identify which of two or more possible items in thc text a reference item rcfcrs to. For example if we come across a sentence such as

[7:13] Spurs played Livcrpool.They beat them.

how do we know who bcat who?

Various grammatical criteria have becn proposed, in terms of transitivity or of mood; suggesting that a rcferencc item will preserve the structural function of its referent on onc or another of these dimcnsions.

For cxample if transitivity is thc determining factor, a reference item functioning as Actor will refer to just that one among the possible referents that has thc Actor function. If mood is thc determining factor,a referencc item functioning as Subject will rcfer to just that one among the possible referents that has the Subject function.Example [7:14] satisfies both transitivity and miodal criteria:

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="7">7:14]</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>The cops</td><td>chased</td><td>the robbers.They</td><td></td><td>caught them.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(transi- tivity)</td><td>Actor</td><td>Process</td><td>Goal</td><td>Actor</td><td>Process Goal</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>(mood)</td><td>Sub- ject</td><td>Predi- cator</td><td>Conplement Subject Predi-</td><td></td><td>cator</td><td>Complement</td></tr></table></body></html>

Here they refers to the cops and themn to the robbers.But consider [7:15] The cops chased the robbcrs.They cluded them.

Hcrc the only possiblc interpretation is that they refers to the robbers and them to the cops; this involves a reversal of the roles in both structuresand yet wc find no difficulty in interpreting it. Similarly:

a.But he wouldn't give it to hin. [7:16] John wantcd Bill's horse. b.But he wouldn't pay him for it.

It is clear that (a) and (b) require opposite interprctations. In a), he is Bill and hin is John whereas in b it is the other way round. There is no feeling that cithcr is morc acccptablc, or morc cohesive, than thc other.

Since referencc is a semantic rclation, the criteria are to be found not in the grammar but in the semantics. It is the meaning that cnables us to disambiguatc in such instances. If there is a grammatical tendency to be had recourse to in those instances.whcre the mcaning does not resolve the problcm, it is likely to lie, as Hasan suggests elsewhere,neither in transitivity nor in mood but in theme.This again is to bc cxpcctcd, since it is the thematic structurc which is the text-forming structure in the clause (scc 7.4.1 below).The particular combination of circumstances that is requircd in order to produce an ambiguous reference item in precisely thc kind of environment whcre transitivity, mood and theme are all incongruent with cach other is so odd that no example of it can bc very convincing;but here is an attempt:

ii. They're staying here, now.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>[7:17] i.</td><td>These ponies</td><td>the children</td><td>were given  thcir by</td><td>grandparents.</td></tr><tr><td>(transitivity)</td><td colspan="3"></td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><td>(mood)</td><td></td><td>Subject</td><td colspan="2"></td></tr><tr><td>(theme)</td><td>Theme</td><td colspan="3"></td></tr></table></body></html>

In the sccond sentencc, they is Actor (in transitivity)Subject in mood) and Themc in themc). In the first sentence,Actor, Subject and Themc are all differcnt itcms: thc Actor is their grandparents, the Subject is the children and thc Theme is these ponies. It sccms that, if anything,the prcferrcd interpretation of they is these ponies- and that in spite of the preference of English for human Subjects.If this is so,it suggests that, to the extent that thcrc is any grammatical criterion at all,it will be found in thc thcmc structure rather than in thc transitivity or modal structure.

Note that this does not apply to substitution.If the first scntence had been followed by the question Which ones? or elliptical Which?, thc more likcly intcrpretation would have been which grandparents? It sccms thercfore that no clearcut grammatical rules can bc given for assigning a reference item to one among a numbcr of possiblc text referents,since the assigriment is typically made on scmantic grounds. If there is more than one refcrent for the identification of he or it or this, thc rcferent is the onc that makes most sense in the context.This is not to say that ambiguity cannot arise; it can, and not infrequcntly does.There may be no clearly predominant candidate for the status of'making most sense'; and in that event, as a last resort we may appeal to the grammar -probably to the themc-rheme structure.OrHER THINGS BEING EQUAL, it seems that the most probable target of a cohesive reference item is thc Theme of the preceding scntence.This seems to hold even if the refercncc item is not itself thematic;compare:

[7:18] These ponies the children wcre given by their grandparents. Have you seen them?

where them still seems more likely to refer to these ponies.But given the range of possible targets in a connected passage, it is unlikely that any purcly grammatical principles could suffice for resolving the issue, and the semantic principle of 'making most sensedifficult as it may be to make explicit, is the only one that could rcally be expcctcd to apply.

As regards restrictions on rcference, thcsc again arc not our main concern; wc are conccrned with what does happen, not with what docs not. But thesc tend also to reflect semantic considerations-often ones that are reflected in the grammar also.Here is just onc example:

[7:19 a. An old man came in with his son. They were very dirty. b.An old man came in with his overcoat.

Thc second sentence is acceptable following a but not, or at best doubtful, following (b). Old man and overcoat arc too different to be brought within thc same presupposition; and this is rclated to the fact that they cannot be coordinatcd: an old nan and his son came in but not an old man and his overcoat came in.

There are instances where a referencc item is uscd when strictly speaking the relation is not one of reference.An cxample will illustrate this:

[7:20] Arthur's vcry proud of his chihuahuas.I don't like them.

This is ambiguous; it could mean 'I don't like Arthur's chihuahuas,or it could mcanI don't like chihuahuas (in general; cf I don't like the things). The second meaning is anomalgus; then is not coreferential with the nominal group Arthur's chihuahuas. It is no doubt to be explained as being coreferential with thc noun Head chihuahuas takcn on its own, without the Modifier.Compare in this regard the comment on $\left[ 3 : 5 2 \right]$ in 3.2.6 above;2nd also [7:4e]I expect you will get this but I'll send it $i f$ you want where it and this both refer to Staff Bulletin no 2,considered as an object sincc it is Goal of the verbs get and send) but they rcfcr to different copies.

Finally there arc instances where thc refcrcncc itembecause of its specificity, serves to disambiguate prcceding sentences that otherwise in themselves are ambiguous; for example

[7:21] I'd rather like to see a play.Its at the Ambassador's.

Here the it shows that the meaning of the first sentence is there's a play I'd like to see'The context of such ambiguities is very oftcn of the kind illustrated by [7:21],namely a clause that is structured as a simple proposition but which is in fact incongruent.The congruent form of expression here would be a clausc of the IDeNTIFyING type, onc with an equative structure such as There's a play I'd rathcr like to see.

Comparison differs from the other forms of referencc in that it is based not on identity of rcfercncc but on non-idcntity: thc refcrcnce item is interpreted, not by bcing identified with what it presupposes, but by being compared with it. The expression non-idcntity'is actually mislcading, because onc possible form of comparability is identity.But thc identity is not the criterion;being identical is just one of the ways in which two things may be like or unlike each other. In the comparative type of reference, the presupposed element takes on the role of a reference poiNT It serves as a standard, to which something else is referred in terms of its likeness, in general or particular; and the same is one kind of likeness. In this way the comparison provides thc source of interpretation for thc refcrencc item; and where thc prcsupposcd element is also in the text, there is cohesion between the two.For cxample, more presupposing oysters in

[7:22] I like the Walrus bcstsaid Alice:becauseyou see, he was a little sorry for the poor oysters'. He ate more than thc Carpenter though said Tweedlcdee.

When likeness takcs the value of samcness,comparison resembles other forms of refercnce in being specific:'same'implics the same'. For this reason same and other comparatives of idcntity are typically accompanicd by the, or some other specific determiner. By contrast to this, when likeness takes the valuc of non-identity (sinilarity or differencc),thc rcfcrcnce is typically non-specific; and comparatives exprcssing non-identity are unlike all other forms of rcferencc in just this respect.So we usually find the same place but a similar place, an other place written as one word, another)a different place.

We can summarize the mcaning of reference by using thc tcrm CO-INTERPRETATION Fhere is_a semantic link bctween the refcrence itemr and that which it prcsupposcs; but this does not mcan that the two nccessarily have the samc rcferent. It means that the interpretation of the reference item DEpENDs IN sOME wAy on that of thc prcsupposedCoreference is one particular form that co-interprctation may take-where the two items do,in fact refer to thc same thing.But the general concept that lies behind the cohesive relation of rcference, and by virtue of which personals, demonstratives and comparatives are alike in their text-forming capacity, is that of co-interprctation. A reference item is onc which is intcrpreted by refcrence to something clse. It is this principle of cointcrpretation that dcfines its role in thc scmantics of the text.

# 7.3.3 Substitution and ellipsis

With substitution there is no implication of specificity.Thc substitution relation has no conncction with specifying or idcntifying a particular referent; it is quite neutral in this regard. So specific forms such as the empty one and non-specific oncs such as an empry one are both cqually likcly. The fact that the nominal substitute one has evolved from thc same source as the indefinite articlc might suggest that substitution is inherently nonspecific; but the meaning of the substitute one is countability,not indefinitencss. This is reflected in the fact that thc plural_of the substitute is ones whilc the plural of the indefinite article is some; and some is also the mass'form of thc article,whercas thcrc is no form of substitute available in the context of a mass noun.

We have referred alrcady to thc main distinction bctwccn substitution and nominal rcference. In rcfcrencc there is typically identity of referent. Substitution is used where thcrc is.no such idcntity.This requires a device which makcs thc connection at the lexiccgrammatical level,at what wc called the level of 'wordingsince the cohesion takes thc form of'same element in thc language (same wording) but different referent. The essence of substitution thcrcfore is contrast: a ncw referent is being defined-and hence there is no substitution for proper names.The contrast is not nccessarily in thc refcrence; it may be in some interpersonal clcment in thc mcaning-thc modality,key,attitude ctc-but thc principlc is the samc. Rcfcrence implies that thcrc is idcntity of meaning between the presupposing item and that which it presupposcs, while substitution implies non-idcntity of meaning.This is illustrated by the use of substitution and ellipsis in responscs; the function of a response is to supply missing information, or confirmation- that is to supply something that is New,and it is this that provides thc cnvironment in which the substitute or clliptical item occurs. For exanple,

[7:23] Did you cook the dinner-NoJohn did.

Thc distinction between refcrcncc and substitution or cllipsis is however lcss clearcut with verbs and clauses than with nouns.Note the diffcrcnce between [7:24a and b]:

a.No, they'rc doing it tomorrow. [7:24]Are they selling the (reference) contents today? b.No,thcy aredoing tomorrow.substitution or ellipsis)

The first, bcing rcfcrcntial, makes it an assumption that they arc selling, and merely supplies the time; it parscs thc question as 'when are thcy sclling the contents?'and has a thcmatic structure of the identifying type; it is cquivalent to the time when thcy're selling $=$ tomorrow', with the verb cmbcddcd in the Theme. An altcrnative form for a) would be It's tomorrow they're doing it. The second does not assume the sclling but states it, because the meaning which provides the contrastive environment for thc substitution - namely thc polarity -is New. The substitute form of the answer parses the question as'are they sclling the contents?'with today'either as given or as additional relevant information; its thematic organization is the fact $=$ that they arc selling;but tomorrow'.For this rcason in a question-answcr sequencc with no possible focus other than the polarity, thc referencc form is not an appropriate form of answer the following example shows this:

Thc substitute or elliptical forms of thc answer, on the other hand, would bc cntircly appropriate:

[7:25] b. Are they scelling thc contents?- Yes, they are (doing). -No, thcy're not (doing)

Conversely,when thc sense requires that the focus is elsewhcre because the process itself is not in qucstion, but only the circumstance - locative, temporal, ctc-with which it is associated the substitute or elliptical form is ruled out. In [7:26],for examplc. the answer presents I sleepas if it was ncw information, and hencc is rather odd:

[7:26] Do you sleep on the couch-No I do do on the sofa

Here thc rcfcrence is also rulcd out,but for a different reason;wc do not say I do it on the sofa because sleep is not a verb of action.But with othcr types of process, reference would be acceptable: Do yon cook every day?- No, I do it every other day.Two final cxamples:

[7:27Does she paint a.No, she docs it for plcasure.(refcrence) for profit? b.No;she does do)for pleasurc.substitution or ellipsis)

Here (b) is unlikely bccause it presents she paints'as new information, whercas the form of the question suggests that the fact that she paints is not at issue; the appropriatc meaning is rather thc rcason shc paints is for plcasure, as cxpressed in (a.

This illustrates the gcneral principle of substitution and ellipsis, with their mcaning of continuity in thc environment of contrast'What is carried over is a Form, a word cr structural feature; and this happens in an environment where the referential meanings arc not idcntical.

Thc structural environment, on the other hand, tends to remain fairly constant; examplcs such as [7:28a and b] are unlikely because they involve too great a structural shift:

[7:28] a. Would you like this book to read?- I've already donc'so. b.Givc me a book to read. I have done this one.

whcreas following Read this book! in a)and Have you read these bocks? in (b), the substitute forms would be quite unexceptionablc.

Why does the speaker not simply repeat the samc word? He can do, of course:

[7:29] I've had an offcr for this.-I'll make you a bcttcr offer.

But notice what happens. In order to signal this as a reitcration and if it was not a reiteration it would not bc cohesive), the spcaker has to shift the tonic away from offer on to better.But offer is a lexical item hencc the placing of the focus on an carlier item is marked' and strongly contrastive, a function of the systemic opposition bctween [7:3oa and b]:

[7:30] a. I'll makc you a better orrer (unmarked focus) b.I'll make you a BErTER offer marked focus)

Yet this opposition is irrelcvant in the context of [7:29j.Therc is only onc possible ncaning herc,not two; the contcxt rcquires the focus on better, but it also requires that it should be an unmarked focus, and this can bc achieved only by the usc of a structure in which therc is no lcxical item following better,so that better either is the last word in thc information unit (ellipsis: I'll nake you a better or is followed only by a grammatical word, onc which docs not carry information focus substitution:I'll make you a better one.Both these have unmarked focus. In othcr words, the substitute and elliptical forms are preferred because thcy create cohesion without disturbing the information structure of thc discoursc:without assigning prominence of a kind which is irrelevant in thc given environment.

Between substitution and ellipsis the difference in meaning is minimal. We defined cllipsis as substitution by zero;we could cqually well have defined substitution as cxplicit ellipsis.Ellipsis is charactcristic particularly of responses: responses to yes/no questions, with ellipsis of thc proposition No he didn'tYes I havectcand to WH-questions,with ellipsis of all elements but the onc required (In the drawer; Next weekend ctc).But whereas there is a significant difference in neaning betwcen elliptical or substitute forms on the one hand and thc corresponding 'filled out'forms on thc other, there is hardly a significant difference betwecn the two cohesive forms themsclves.For example,

a.She mIGhr lock after the shop [7:31] Let's sce if Granny can look for us. aftcr the shop for us. bi. Shc MIGHT do. bii. She MIGHT.

As we saw in the last paragrapha differs from (b in that it makcs explicit the Given element look after the shop for us and in doing so inposcs a markcd information structurc in which Mighr look after tlhc shop for us is specifically contrasted with might look after THE shop for us; whercas in b) thc distribution of information is neutral- the tonic falls in its unmarkcd placc. This is clearly a imcaningful choice on the part of the speakcr.But bctwecn bi) and bii therc is hardly any difference in the meaning. Therc arc many contexts in which only onc or thc other is possiblc; for numerous speakcrs of English, for cxample, only (ii) could occur here.Whcre both are possible the substitutc form appcars slightly morc explicit in its sense of'same form in a different environment':

[7:32 Has Smith reacted to that paragraph about him in thc paper? -No he hasn't. -He hasn't donc yct but when he reads it carefully he may think again.

[7:33]Have an applc.-I'll take this.-Thc other one's better.

Thc use of do in [7:32] and one in [7:33] suggests in each case a somcwhat more pointcd contrast than would be achievcd by the elliptical form he hasn't yet, the other's better. And a clausal substitutc may scrve to disambiguate in certain rcported speech contexts:

[7:34] Will Granny look after thc shop for us?-Shc hasn't said.

The elliptical form may mean eithcr 'she hasn't said that she will or she hasn't said whcther shc will or notwhcreas the substitutc form she hasn't said so could only mcan the formcr.But in many instances the distinction betwecn substitution and ellipsis is scarcely noticeablc, and can be treated for practical purposes as a matter of free variation.

# 7.3.4 Lexical cohesion:reiteration and collocation

Lexical cohesion is 'phoric' cohesion that is cstablished through the structure of the LExis, or vocabulary, and hencc like substitution at the lexicogrammatical level.To recapitulatc this point:

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Linguistic level at which&#x27;phoric&#x27;relation is established</td><td>Type of cohesion</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Semantic (Gramnatical</td><td>Rcference Substitution and ellipsis</td></tr></table></body></html>

Lexical cohesion embraces two distinct though related aspects which we referred to as REITERATION and COLLOCA TION.

I.Reiteration. This is the repetition of a lexical item,or the occurrence of a synonym of some kind,in thc context of refercnce;that is,whcre the two occurrences havc the same referent. Typically,thercforc,a reitcrated Icxical item is accompanied by a rcferencc itcmusually the or a dcmonstrativc. The complex consisting of the plus rciterated lexical item is thercfore cohcsive by rcfcrence. But since reiteration is itself cohesive in its own right as shown by the fact that cohesion takes placc even where there is no referential relation (cf ncxt paragraph), such instances constitute a double tie and are interprctcd here in this way see Chapter 8,8.3 and note 2 to Text 1.

2.Collocation. As remarked abovc, the rcpctition of a lexical item is cohesive in its own right, whcther or not there is idcntity of refercnce, or any referential relation at all between the two. The cohcsion derives from the lexical organization of language.A word that is in some way associatcd with another word in the preceding text,bccause it is a direct repetition of it, or is in some scnse synonymous with it or tends to occur in the same lexical environment, coheres with that word and so contributes to the texture.

The following passage contains illustrations of both these types:

[7:35] Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying undcr the table: she opcncd it, and found in it a very small cake, on which thc words 'EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants. Well, I'll eat it'said Aliceand if it makes mc larger,I can reach the key; and if it makes me smaller, I can creep under the door; so eithcr way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens! She ate a little bit and said anxiously to hersclf, Which way? Which way?' holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing,and shc was quite surpriscd to find that shc remaincd the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one cats cake but Alice had got so much into the way of cxpecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it sccmed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in thc common way. So she sct to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

The sccond occurrcnce of cake,in when one eats cake second paragraph)is without rcference item; there is no refcrcntial link with thc first occurrencc, but thc repetition itself constitutcs a tic. The third occurrence, in very soon finished off the cakeis with a reference itemherethereforethere are two ties, one of reference, thc referential identity bcing shown by the, and one of reiteration. Othcr instanccs of lexical cohesion in thc passagc are provided by eat...cat...ate...eats open...key...door lrger...saller...the sane size;makes larger...makes smaller.. rouinghappens...appen.

The principlc behind both typcs is the cohesive effect achicved by the continuity of lexical mcaning.This may be combincd with a referential relation but does not depend on this for its cffect. The cohesion is a function of the relation between thc lexical itcms themselves, which has both scmantic aspect-synonymy,hyponymymetonymy,ctc-and a purely lexical or collocational aspect, the mutual expectancy between words that ariscs from thc one occurring frequently in the cnvironment of the other, or (a bettcr way of looking at it) of the two occurring in a range of cnvironmcnts common to both. The wholc of the vocabulary of a language is internally structured and organized along many dimensions, which collectively determine 'what goes with what' these tendencies arc as much part of the linguistic system as are the principles of grammatical structure, even though thcy are statable only as tendcncies,not as rules'It is the essentially probabilistic naturc of lexical patterning which makes it cffcctive in the crcation of texturc;because they lie outside thc bounds of structure, and are not constraincd by structural relationships, the lexical patterns servc to transform a series of unrelated structures into a unified, coherent whole.

# 7-3.5 Conjunction

Conjunction is somewhat different from the other cohesive relations. It is based on the assumption that thcre are in thc linguistic system forms of systematic relationships between sentences.There are a number of possible ways in which the system allows for the parts of a text to be connected to one another in mcaning.

There arc certain elemcntary logical relations inherent in ordinary language; doubtless these derive ultimately from thc categories of human experience, and thcy figure importantly in thc sociolinguistic construction of rcality,the process whereby a model of the universe is gradually built up over countless generations in the coursc of semiotic interaction. (They can be regarded as departures from thc idealized norm represcnted by formal logic; but it is worth remembering that in thc history of human thought the concepts of formal logic derive, however indirectly, from the logic of natural languagc.) Thcse logical rclations arc embodicd in linguistic structure, in thc form of coordination, apposition, modification, ctc.Analogous to these are certain non-structural, text-forming relations which are what we are calling conjunctive rclations.Conjunctive relations are cncoded not in the form of grammatical structures but in the looser, more pliable form of linkages bctween thc components of a tcxt.

The specific conjunctive relations are those of and, yet', so' and 'then'and cach of thcse may occur in cither an external'or aninternal context. The lattcr distinction, which derivcs from the functional basis of the semantic system, dctcrmincs the locus of the conjunction thc conjunction may be located in the phenomena that constitute the content of what is being said (cxtcrnal), or in thc interaction itself, the social process that constitutes the speech cvent (internal).Here is a furthcr set of examples ofeach.

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2">&#x27;and&#x27;</td><td>Extcrnal</td><td>Internal</td></tr><tr><td>They gave hin food and They gave me fish to clothing. And they looked eat. And I don&#x27;t like after him till he was better.</td><td>fish.</td></tr><tr><td>yet&#x27;</td><td>They looked after him well. Yet he got no better.</td><td>Yet it can&#x27;t bc; Henry&#x27;s in Manchester. That must be Hcnry.</td></tr><tr><td>&#x27;so&#x27;</td><td>He drove into the harbour one night. So they took his liccnce</td><td>tonight.So don&#x27;t be late. We&#x27;re having guests</td></tr><tr><td>&#x27;then&#x27;</td><td>Hc stayed thcre for three years. Then he went on to New Zealand. away.</td><td>Hc found his way. eventually.Then he&#x27;d left his papers behind.</td></tr></table></body></html>

Conjunction docs not depend eithcr on referential meaning or on identity or association of wording.Conjunctive relations are not'phoric'; they represent semantic links bctwecn the elements that are constitutive of text.Thcre arc numcrous possible ways of interpreting conjunctive relations; the fourfold scheme we have adopted herc is simply the one we have found most helpful in thc quest for a general characterization of cohesive relations which would not bc closed'-which would allow further subclassification as and when nceded.A purcly structural approach would suggcst other modes of classification, bascd for example on the traditional categorization of subordinate clauses. As already noted, thcre are structural analogucs of the conjunctive rclations; herc arc some examples of the way each is expressed:

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2"></td><td rowspan="2">Textual (conjunctive)</td><td colspan="2">Structural (logical)</td></tr><tr><td>paratactic</td><td>hypotactic</td></tr><tr><td>&#x27;and&#x27; &#x27;then&#x27; &#x27;yet&#x27; &#x27;so&#x27;</td><td>Also,.. However, Consequently,. Subsequcntly,..</td><td>..and. ..yet. .SO. ...then.</td><td>besides.. although.. because. after..</td></tr></table></body></html>

In the same way, the phoric'relations of reference,and substitution and cllipsis, arc also found as structure-forming relations within the sentence.) But from our present standpoint it is thc nature of text,rathcr than the organization of grammar, that has determincd thc interpretation and presentation of thc systems involved.

# 7.3.6 Summary

The semantic basis of cohesion in English tcxts can be summarized as follows(and $c f$ the Table at the cnd of 7.3 abovc).

Cohesion consists (1) in continuity of lexicogrammatical mcaning (relatcdncss of form'phoric)

![](img/56b4520a471b6829560f8021615d892a98c1260aabed38a516458f39cc4b7fb6.jpg)

Substitution and ellipsis are relevant cspecially in thc environment of discontinuity of refcrcncc.

(2) in continuity of referential meaning (relatcdness of reference: phoric)

personal (communication role of referent) RerERENCEdcmonstrative (proximity of referent) comparative (similarity to preceding referent (3) in semantic conncction with the preceding text (non-phoric)

(additive adversative in ideational meaning (external) CONJUNCTION terms causal ofinterpersonal meaning (internal) temporal

These are the cohcsive relations. In categorizing them in this way, it is perhaps useful to add a reminder of the difference between the cohesive relations themselves and the means by which they are represented in the Iinguistic system. The COHESIVE RELATIONs THEMSELVEs can be interpreted as being either lexicogrammatical in nature 1) or semantic, the latter bcing cither referential (2) or conjunctive (3).The type of cohcsion in other words, is either onc that depcnds on semantic rclations in thc linguistic system or one that depcnds on lexicogrammatical relations. But thc Expression of cohesivc relations involves both the semantic and the lexicogrammatical systems in all cases: that is, both choiccs in mean\~ ing, and their realization in words and structures.

Thus cven where cohesion is achieved through the setting up of a purely formal relationship in the text, such as the substitution of one for the noun expressing thc Thing,the choices that are involved, not only in the selection of the particular thing-meaning itself but cqually in the idcntification of it with a preceding thing-mcaning, arc scmantic choices. And converscly,even where thc cohesive relationship is a semantic one, it has to bc rcalized in thc lexicogrammatical system; for example, idcntity of referential meaning as expressed through the grammatical systcm of third pcrson pronouns.Here is a final summary tablc:

# 7.4 Cohesion and the text

Texture involvcs much morc than mercly cohcsion.In the construction of text the establishment of cohesive rclations is a necessary component; but it is not the whole story.

In the most general terms there are two other components of texture. One is the textual structurc that is internal to the sentence: the organization of the sentencc and its parts in a way which relates it to its environment.Thc other is the macrostructurc'of the text,that establishes it as a text of a particular kind - conversation,narrative,lyriccommcrcial correspondence and so on.

# 7.4.1 Texture within the sentence

The main components of texturc within the sentence in English are thc theme systems and thc information systcns (cf the summary at the cnd of Chapter 1).

Thesc have becn outlined in an article by Halliday.\* Thc themc systems arc those concerned with the organization of thc clausc as a mcssage: its structure in terms of a THEME and a rcmainder known as thc RHEMF), and a wide range of thematic variation that is associatcd with this structure in one way and another. Thc following cxamples givc an idea of the semantic range that is involved:

[7:36] a. John's aunt  left him this duckpress Theme Rhemc b. John was left this duckpress by his aunt Theme |Rheme c. This duckpress  John's aunt Ieft him Theme Rheme d. What John's aunt left him was this duckpress Theme: Identified Rhemc:Identifier e.The way John got this duckpress was by a legacy from his aunt Theme: Identified Rheme: Identifier f. Bequcathing this duckpress was what John's aunt did for him Theme: Identifier Rhemc:Identified

The information systems are those conccrncd with thc organization of thc text into units of information.This is exprcssed in English by thc intonation pattcrns, and it is therefore a feature only of spoken English. In written English punctuation can bc used to show information structure, although it cannot express it fully, and most punctuation practice is a kind of compronisc bctween information structure (punctuating according to the intonation) and sentence structure (punctuating according to thc grammar).The intonation of spoken English cxpresscs the information structure in a very simple way.Conncctcd speech takcs the form of an unbroken succcssion of intonation units, or TONe GRoups as they are generally called; and each tone group represcnts what the spcaker chooses to encodc as one piece of information onc unit of the tcxtual process.

Each information unit is then structured in tcrms of two clements, a NEW clement,expressing what the speaker is prescnting as information that is not recoverable to the hearer from othcr sources; and a Given element, expressing what the speakcr is presenting as information that is recoverable to thc hearer from sone source or other in thc cnvironment-the situation, or thc preceding text. The Given clement is optional; the New is present in cvery information unit, sincc without it therc would not be a separatc information unit.

In the following examples, the information unit boundary is shown by $1 1$ and the New element is printed in sMAlL CAPrrALS:

[7:37] a. $1 1$ JOHN'S AUNT LEFT HIM TIHIS DUCKPRESS // b. $1 1$ JOHN's AuNr lcft him this duckpress // c. $/ / $ JOHN'S AUNT $1 1$ left him THIS DUCKPRESS/ d. $1 1$ John WAS LEFT THIS DUCKPRESS $/ /$ by HIS AUNT// c. $j \big /$ JOHN was left this duckpress $/ /$ by HIS AUNT// f.//JOHN $1 1$ WAS LEFI THIS DUCKPRESS BY HIS AUNT $j \big /$ g. $/ /$ THIS DUCKPRESS $/ \beta$ JOHN's AUNT left him //

Thc number of possibilities is very large indeed, and the combination of thematic systems with information systems gives a paradigm which, with a clause of avcrage lcngth, runs into the tens and hundrcds of thousands. Sincc cach one has a different textual meaning this might seem unmanageably complex - until it is realized that this enormous number of different textual structures within the sentence is the result of combining a number of related but indcpendent choices each onc of which is by itsclf very simple. If there are only twenty differcnt choices, each of only two possibilitics this aready yields over a million forms. In fact of course things arc not quite as simple as that; the number of possibilitics depends on the structure of thc scntence,the choices are not fully independent, so that not all the theoretically possible combinations occur, and not all choices are limitcd to two options. But it is this principlc on which the sentence is structured intcrnally in its role as the realization of text; and this internal texturc is the structural counterpart of cohesion.Neither cohcsion alonc, nor intcrnal textual structure alonc,suffices to make of a sct of sentences a text.Texturc is a product of the interaction berween the two.

# 7.4.2 The texture of discourse

The third and final component of texture is the structure of discourse. By this wc mean the larger structure that is a property of the forms of discoursc themselves: the structure that is inherent in such concepts as narrative, prayer, folk-ballad, formal correspondencc, sonnct, opcrating instructions, television drama and the like.

It is safe to say that every genre has its own discourse structurc.It might seem as if informal, spontancous conversation had no structure of its own ovcr and above thc intcrnal organization of each sentencc and the cohesion bctwecn the sentences.But thc work of Harvey Sacks and Emanuel Schegloff has shown bcyond question that conversation is very highly structured. Thcre are definite principles regulating the taking of turns in conversationand one of the functions of some of the items opcrating cohcsively as conjunctives (Chaptcr s) is that of marking and holding turns.There are scveral types of what Sacks and Schcgloff call adjacency pairs, ordered sequenccs of two clcments in a conversation that are rclated to cach other and mutually presupposing, like grcetings, invitations, or question-answer sequences. The discoursc structure of a convcrsation is in turn rcinforced by the cohesion, which cxplicitly tics togcther the related parts, bonding them more closcly to each other than o the others that are not so rclated; hcnce Goffman's observation that there tends to bc a Icss meaningful relationship between two sequential nterchanges than bctwecn two sequential speeches (ie turns) in an interhange(Interaction Ritalp 37

Other torms of discoursc are more obviously structured than conversation; and some, notably narrativc, have been studied in considerable detail in a variety of diffcrent languages.There is no nccd here to labour thc point that the presence of certain clements, in a ccrtain ordcr, is essential to our concept of narrativc; a narrative has, as a text, a typical organization, or one of a number of typical organizations, and it acquires texture by virtuc of adhcring to these forms.Litcrary forms, including thc strict'verse forms -culturally cstablishcd and highly-valued norms such as those of mctre and rhyme schcme,defining complex notions such as the sonnet,iambic pentamctcr blank vcrse, and the like - all fall within the general category of discoursc structurcs. They arc aspects of texture, and combine with intrasentence structure and intersentcncc cohesion to providc the total text-forming resources of the culture.

# 7.4.3 The role of linguistic analysis

The linguistic analysis of a text is not an interprctation of that text: it is an cxplanation. This point cmerges clcarly, though it is often misunderstood, in the context of stylistics, the linguistic analysis of literary texts.

The linguistic analysis of literature is not an intcrpretation of what thc text means; it is an cxplanation of why and how it means what it does.

Similarly,to the extent that linguistic analysis is conccrned with evaluationa linguistic analysis of a tcxt is not an evaluation of that tcxtit is an explanation of how and why it is valued as it is. A linguistic analysis of a literary tcxt aims at explaining the interpretation and evaluation that are put upon that text.Thc rolc of linguistics is to say how and why the text means what it does to thc reader or listener, and how and why he evaluates it in a certain way.

This point can be generalized to the study of texts as a wholc. Thc analysis of cohcsion, togcthcr with other aspects of texture, will not in gcncral add anything ncw to thc intcrpretation of a text.What it will do is to show why the text is interpretcd in a certain way;including why it is ambiguous in interpretation wherevcr it is so.It will cxplain the nature of conversational infcrences, the meanings that the hearer gets out of thc text without the spcakcr having apparently put thcm in-presuppositions from the culture,from the sharcd cxperience of the participants,and from thc situation and the surrounding tcxt. It is the text-forming or textual' component of the semantic system that spccifically providcs thc linguistic means through which such presuppositicns are made. Similarly the analysis of cohesion will not tell you that this or that is a good text or a bad text or an effectivc or incffective one in the context.But it will tell you somcthing of wHy you THInk it is a good tcxt or a bad text, or whatcver you do think about it.

It is in this perspective that in the final chapter we suggest mcans for describing the cohesive patterns of a text.The intention is to providc for a reasonably comprehensive picturc of this aspcct of texture;and in this way to offer an insight into what it is that makes a text a text.

# Chapter 8

# The analysis of cohesion

In this concluding chapter we suggest a method for the analysis of cohesion in a tcxt.First there is a brief discussion of thc principles of analysis 8.1);ncxt, a coding schemc for the various typcs of cohcsion 8.2)and finally an analysis of seven short passages of text.

# 8.1 General principles

The basic concept that is cmployed in analysing the cohesion of a text is that of the TiE,alrcady discussed in Chapter 1.A tie is a complex notion, because it includcs not only the cohesive element itself but also that which is presupposed by it. A tic is best interpreted as a RELArioN betwcen these two elements.

A tie is thus a relational concept. It is also DIRCTioNAL the rclation is an asymmetric one. It may go cither way: the dircction may bc anaphoric, with the presupposed element preccding,or cataphoric, with thc presupposed clement following. The typical direction, as has becn illustrated throughout the discussion, is thc anaphoric one; it is natural,aftcr all, to presuppose what has alrcady gonc rather than what is to follow. But this is not to say the presupposition will necessarily be aimed at the immediately preccding sentence. It often is,and this is perhaps the simplest form that cohesion takcs: a single tie between a pair of clcments in adjacent sentences, with the sccond of the pair presupposing thc first while the first does not presuppose anything else in its turn. Most of the examples wc have cited have bccn of this kind,if only for the sakc of brevity.But although this can reasonably be rcgarded as the paradigm form of a cohesive tic, actual instances of cohcsion are typically somewhat more complex.

In the first place, as has frequently been brought out, any sentence may have more than one tie in it.This is in facr thc usual pattern in connected texts,of whatever variety.Even such a short scntencc as the sccond onc in [8:1],which at first sight sccms to contain only one tic, has in fact two, since in addition to the refercnce itcm itpresupposing the plan there is lcxical cohesion of succeed and try

[8:1] A little provokcd, she drcw back and after looking everywhere for thc Queen whom shc spicd out at lasta long way off)shc thought she would try thc plan, this time, of walking in thc opposite direction. It succecded beautifully.

In the sccond place, however, the form of cohcsive ties may divergc from the simplc,idealized typc in eithcr, or bothof two ways.i Thc presupposed iten may be not in the immediately preccding sentence,but in some sentence that is more distant in the past.ii The presupposc item may itself be cohesivc, presupposing another item that is still further back; in this way there may be a whole chain of presuppositions beforc the original target item is rcached.The following passage exemplifics both these points:

[8:2 The last word ended in a long blcat, so like a sheep that Alicc quite started 1).She looked at the Qucen who scemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up in wool2.Alice rubbed her eycs,and lookcd again 3).She couldn't makc out what had happencd at all(4).Was she in a shop s)And was that really-was it really a sheep that was sitting on thc other side of the counter (6)Rub as she would, she could make nothing morc of it 7)

In scntcnce (2)the she refers to Alice in sentencc 1).This is the simplest form of presupposition, relating the sentence to that which inmediately precedes it; we shall refer to this as an IM MEDiA TE tie.Similarly the she in 4 refers to the Alice in 3.But the she ins has as the target ofits presupposition another instance of she, that in 4) and in order to resolve it we havc to follow this through to the occurrcnce of Alice in sentence 3) We shall call this type a MEDiATED tie. It is not necessary that the mediating items should always bc thc same, although in this casc the item mediating betwecn she in 5 and Alice in3 is,in fact,another instance of she. It might have bcen anothcr form of the personal (eg: her), or another type of cohesive elemcnt altogether (eg: the poor thing)

Now consider the clause Rub as she wonld, in 7).Here we havc an instancc of lexical cohesion, and it is interesting to note that it is necessary to resolvc this tie in order for thc passage to be understood.Taken by itself, rb as she would is uninterpretable if onc mct it out of context one would probably cxpect somnething to follow such as she conld not get it t shine. Icrc it must cohere with Alice rubbed her eyes.This however, is in sentcnce (3), and there are no intcrimediate rcfercnces to thc rubbing ofthe cyes. Here wc havc what wc shall call a REmorE tie; and the distance between the two itcms can be very much grcatcr than this, cspecially in spoken language where a tic often spans largc numbers of intcrvening sentences.

Finally,a tic may bc BorH mediatcd AND remote. For example,thc sh in sentence (7) presupposes nothing in (6) but refcrs back to scntence (5) hence the tie is remote. At thc same timc the presupposed item in $( s )$ is again she, which has to bc followed through to the she in (4) and finally to thc Alice in (3) so it is also mediatcd. This again is quite typical of both speech and writing,with a tendency for the more informal modes of discourse to be the more complex, as they are also in sentence structure.

When analysing a text for cohcsion it is uscful to note not only the typc of tie -whcther immcdiatc or not and if not immediatc, whether mediated, remote, or both- but also the distance separating the prcsupposing from the prcsupposed.Hence if an instance is coded as mcdiated, this can be accompanied by a figurc indicating the number of intcrmediatc sentences which participate in thc chain of cohesion, having in them an itcm which is both presupposed and presupposing, like the she in $\left( 4 \right)$ If an instance is coded as remotc, there can again be an accompanying figure, this time showing the number of sentences separating the presupposing from the presupposed while not themselves participating in the prcsupposition. So thc she in sentence (7) would be codcd as mediated: 2,thc number 2 referring to sentences (5) and (4) both of which have she in them, and also as remotc:Iwhere the I rcfers to sentence (6)which has no part in the resolution of the she. Thc two figures can simply be addcd together to show the overall distance, the total number of sentences occurring in betwccn the presupposing clement and that by which it is ultimately resolved.

It should be strcssed that in all cascs it is the number of intervening SENTEnces that is being counted,and not (in the casc of a mediated tie) the numbcr of occurrences of a mediating cohesive clcment. This is because our interest lics in thc way in which cohesive rclations build up a text.As far as texture is concerned, thc inportant qucstion is is this sentence reIated by cohesion or not; and if it is, in how many different ways? Which items in the sentcnce enter into cohesive relations,and what is the typc and distancc of the cohesion in each instance? Once we have established that she=Aliceis functioning in the sentence as a cohesive agent by pcrsonal rcference, we have established thc salient fact; it docs not much mattcr for cohesive purposes (however intcresting it might turn out to bc in other respcctswhether she occurs once or half a dozen times within thc sentence.

For any sentencc,thcrefore, we shall indicate, first of all, how many cohcsive ties it contains:how many instances of a cohesive element that arc not resolved by presupposition within the sentence.This shows the total extent of the demands it makcs on thc preceding (or rather the surrounding) text. Secondly, for each of thesc tics we shall spccify what typc of cohesion is involved, in terms of referencc, substitution and so on; this can bc specificd up to a varying degree of delicacy, as suggested in 8.2 below. Finally,for each tie wc shall specify whether it is immediate or non-immcdiatc, and if non-imncdiate,whether mediated,rcnotc nonmediated), or both; and we shall assign numerical values to cach instance of a non-immediate tic, showing the number of intcrvening scntences. This figure is the indcx of cohesive distance, and it shows both thc number of mediating sentences -those containing an clcment that forms a link in a chain-and the number of non-mediating scntences, those that do not contribute to the tie in question.

In presenting a framework for thc analysis and notation of a text,however, wc should emphasize the fact that wc regard thc analysis of a text in terms of such a framework as a mcans to an end, not as an end in itself. Therc are numerous rcasons why one might undertake such an analysis, and the enquiry will lead in all kinds of differcnt directions; it is likely to mean one thing in the context of the tcaching of composition, another thing in the context of thc automatic analysis of text by computer, and something different again in the context of stylistic studies.Whatever the ultimatc goal, onc will almost ccrtainly wish not only to codify the text in terms of cohesive catcgories but also to inspect the individual instances of cohesion, to look closely at the actual words and phrases that enter into cohesive ties and see what patterns of texture then cmerge. A particular text,or a genre, may exhibit a general tendency towards the usc of certain features or modes rather than othcrs: for cxample, in certain typcs of narrative, where thc continuity is provided by the doings or thc pcrsonality of one individual, it would bc interesting to know whcthcr this is reflccted in a predominance of rcference to that individual as a cohesive device. Other questions that arise are: Does a parricular speaker or writer favour one type of cohesion over others? Docs the density of cohcsive tics remain constant or vary, and if it varics,is thc variation systematically rc lated to somc other factor or factors? What is thc rclation betwcen cohesion and thc division of a written text into paragraphs ?\* There are many fundamental questions which can bc approached by taking thc systematic study of cohesion as a point of departure.

Not inmcdiate: MEDIATED [numbcr of intervening sentences] $M [ \mathfrak { n } ]$ REMOTE NON-MEDIATED [number Of intervening sentences] N[n] CATAPHORIC K

Note: Any cohesive instance, or tic', may be immcdiate' (presupposing an itcm in a contiguous sentence or not immediatc. If not immediate, it may be mcdiated'having one or more intervening sentences that enter into a chain of presupposition orremote(having one or morc intervening sentenccs not involved in thc prcsupposition), or both. Finally it may bc anaphoric or cataphoric; cataphoric tics are rclatively infrcqucnt and almost always immcdiatc.A tic is assumed to be anaphoric unless marked 'K'.

The coding schemc provides a means of reprcsenting the cohcsive patterns in a text in terms of the present analysis.Each sentencc is given an index nunbcr,and the total number of ties in that sentence is cntered in thc appropriate column.Then for EACH IIE we specify(A) the type of cohcsion and B) its distancc and direction.

The coding is designed to allow for variation in the delicacy of the analysis.For example, suppose we had

What is Mary doing?-Baking a pie. we could codc the second sentence as any of the following:

Ellipsis E Clausal cllipsis E3 Clausal ellipsis: modal E32 Clausal ellipsis: modal:total E321 and with any of these we could spccify functioning as answer to WHqucstionsimply by adding a7':E7E37,E327 0r E3217.There is also verbal ellipsis, typc E221, but this can be prcdicted from the clausal ellipsis.) In the coding of all types of cohcsion cxcept conjunction, the numbers 1-5 arc used for subcategorization and 6-9 for cross-categorization. In conjunction thcrc is no cross-categorization, but there is more subcategorization, so all the numbers $\tau { - } 8$ arc used for this purpose.The primary types of cohesion are shown by their initial letters: R (reference), S substitution)E (elipsis)C conjunction)L lexical).Letters arc also used to indicate the dircction and distance.

In the final section we present an analysis of scven sample texts.

# Notes

1 Sentence 1:last is anbiguous.If it mcans the last of those just utteredit is as codcd here ifit mearrsprecedingit should be coded C 1.3.There scems no way of telling.and it may rather be a blend of both.   
2 Sentence 6:the shows counter to bc referentially related to shop:what counter-the onc in the shop just mentioned).This is one tie; thc cohesion provided by the collocational link bctween thc Icxical items counter and shopwhich is independent of rcfcrence, constitutes another.   
3 Possibly a past in past' tensc such as what had happened in Sentence 4 could be treated as an instance of conjunction, presumably $C _ { 4 1 . 3 }$ We have not attemptcd to include tensc in the present treatment.   
4 Sentencc 3:Alice is coded as N.1not M.1since strictly spcaking thc repetition of a proper name is lexical not referential cohesion, and therefore the she in the intcrvening scntence is irrelevant.   
s Sentence 7: Thc two occurrences of she are both entered. It could be argued that two occurrences of a rcference item constitutc only a single tie; but this would be diffcult to apply, and we adopt the simpler solution.

Can I tell you about the time when I screamed (1 Yes, do 2.

Well, I met a thief in my house (3). I had one of those nice old houses -I was very lucky (4).It was about thirty years old, on stone pillars, with a long stone staircase up and folding doors back on to a verandah (s).And I came through the door from the kitchen, and a thief carrying my handbag emerged through my bedroom door into thc living room at the same moment(6).

Splendidly timed (7)!

# Notes

1 Sentence 1o:Thc form of texture provided by a Question-and-Answer sequence is rcgarded as a discourse feature here the structure of convcrsation see 7.4.2.Since there is no ellipsis here, this is not an instance of cohesion.   
2 Sentence 16: The the in the sound that went floating out is primarily cataphoric; but the lexical relation betwecn sound and scream suggests that it may also bc rcferring anaphorically.   
3Sentence 18:It is likely that the door here refers to thc main door of the houseif so the is exophoric and not cohesive.   
4 Sentence 20 is an alternative question these arc mixcd in typc, being partly yes/no and partly WH-(hence the mixed intonation pattern, with first part rising and second part falling).The response is coded as a response to both.

# Note

The continued use of the in the bad thing may be interprcted as anaphoric as well as cataphoric,suggesting a specific entity which stays around and contrasting with the general qualities of soliude and being alonefor thc same rcason bad thing is analysed as L 1.6solitde and eing alone as L 1.9.The cohcsive pattern reflects and reinforces thc interplay of localized and gencralized imagcry;and so contributes to thc impression of somcthing that is complex,both abstract and intangible, and at the sane time concrcte and very tangible.

# Text IV (autobiography)

I had found when a boy in Dublin on a table in the Royal Irish Acadcmy a panphlct on Japancsc art and rcad there of an animal paintcr so remarkable that horses he had painted upon a temple wall had slipped down aftcr dark and trampled the neighbours'fields of rice(1).Somebody had come into thc temple in the carly morning, had been startlcd by a shower of water drops, had looked up and seen painted horses still wet from thc dew-covercd ficlds,but now trcmbling into stillness'2).

I had soon mastered Mathers' symbolic system, and discovered that for a considerable minority -whom I could sclect by ccrtain unanalysable characteristics - thc visible world would completcly vanish, and that world, summoned by thc symbol, take its place 3).One day when alonc in a third-class carriage, in the very middle of the railway bridge that crosses thc Thamcs nearVictoria,I smelt inccnse 4.I was on my way to Forest Hill; might it not come from some spirit Mathcrs had callcd up s)I had wondered when I smelt it at Madame Blavatsky's-if therc might be some contrivance, some secret ccnser, but that explanation was no longcr possible (6).I believed that Salamander of his but an image, and presently I found analogies betwcen smell and image (7).That smell must bc thought-created, but what certainty had I, that what had taken me by surprisc,could be from my own thought, and if a thought could affect the sense of smell, why not the scnse of touch (8)? Then I discovered among that group of students that surrounded Mathers, a man who had fought a cat in his drcams and awakened to find his breast covcred with scratches (9).Was there an impassable barrier betwecn thosc scratches and the tramplcd fields of rice Io? It would seem so, and yet all was uncertainty (11).What fixed law would our experiments leave to our imagination12

Note The repctition of the lexical item smell provides an intcresting illustration of the diffcrent

refercntial relations that nay bc involved in lcxical reiteration.Thc incidcnt referrcd to in S.4 stands in no explicit relationship to that in which the word had last occurred s9 sentences earlier hence L 9.In S.6 smelt refers to tht carlicr incident in a context in which it is exphcitly contrasted with the present one hence L.8.In S.7 wc are back to thc prescnt,so L.8 again.In S.8 it occurs twiccfirst in reference to the prcscnt hat sme.so l.6 secondlyin a general context the sense of smellwhich therefore includes the prcceding instance and hence is represcnted as L.7.Thcre is considerable indetermnacy among these catcgories.which are probably the most difficult to apply with any consistency; but they are not irrelevant to patterns of text construction.

It is perhaps questionable whether the lid that was left offie not madeSentence 15 is referentially identical with thc lid that did not exist (Sentencc 14).But this is a harmless assumption that is required for interpretation of the the.

# Bibliography

The Bibliography contains selctcd items related in various ways to thc main theme.

1.Standard grammars of English, such as those of CurineFries, and Jespersenfigure both as general background and for their discussion of particular elcments that enter into the exprcssion of cohesion.Also listed are some other works that contain rclcvant background matcrial, for examplc by Abercrombie, Ullmann, and Gleason.

Thc major source of up-to-date information on English,grammar upto-date both in terms of the English languagc and in tcrms of linguistic scholarship) is providcd by A Grammar of Contemporary Englishby Quirk and others and its shorter version A University Grammar ofEnglishAmerican title A Concise Grammar of Contemporary English.Both contain treatments of thc areas of the grammar that are involved in cohesion.

2.Other gencral works on English have bccn includcd where thcy throw light on the theorctical background of the prcscnt account; for cxample HudsonEnglishi Complex Sentences; Sinclair, A Course in Spoken English:Grammar.

Two large-scale studies of English texts are of special relevancc: that by Huddlcston and others, on grammar, and that by Sinclair and others, on lcxis.It is unfortunatc that these were written at a timc whcn tcxt studies were heretical in linguistics, and so they were not published; but they were distributed in the form of reports.)

3. Many articles have appcared particularly in transformational grammar dealing with cohesivc relations within the sentencc, cspccially pronominal refercnce and conjunction.A selection of thcsc has becn included; see for example Lees and KlimaGeorge Lakoff, Robin Lakoff, and Postal.

4.Discoursc structure in languages othcr than English, typically non

Indo-European languages,has been describcd in numcrous studics inspired particularly by the thcorctical work of Pike and Gleason.These studies have not been cited herc;bibliographies are readily available.

5.Cohcsion in literary texts is treated in a recent book by Gutwinski which had not yct appearcd at thc timc of writing).Asidc from this,as far as literary studics are conccrned, thc list includes some gencral works on stylc and thc linguistic study of literature, such as Leech's A Linguistic Guide to English Poetry and also some recent collections of essays,such as Chatman's Literary Style:a symposium.Stylistic studics of particular prose or verse texts have not becn listedfor rcfcrences to these,scc Richard W. Bailey and Dolores M. Burton, English Stylistics: a bibliography CambridgeMass:MIT Press,1968.

6.Somc recent works have bccn cited from thc ficld of rhetoric and composition, where there is systenatic trcatment of discoursc structurc in a primarily educational context.

From the newer,related ficld of language variety (register studies are includcd one or two general trcatments, such as that of Benson and Greaves; and certain papers which rclate particularly to cohesion in this context, for cxample thosc by Jean Urc.

7Finally reference is madc to selected books and articles dealing with particular aspects of the English language that in one way or othcr relate to cohcsion:either topics falling dircctly under the main headings (rcference, substitution and cllipsis, conjunction, lexical cohcsion),or parts of the grammar that figure promincntly in cohesive patterns such as the noun phrase, or nominal group;see for example Petcr Fries).
