Teacher-student group conferences (TsGCs) integrate the advantages of peer response with those of individual writing conferences, allowing teachers to comment on learners' drafts while students apprentice into the peer reviewer role by observing the teacher's model. Although several scholars have advocated for TsGCs as a pedagogical practice, TsGCs have received little empirical attention. This study exemplifies how I used TsGCs as an intervention in my graduate-level EAP writing class. Using data from pre/post course surveys, post-TsGC feedback forms, post-course interviews, and final course evaluations, I report on students' perceptions of the TSGCs, including their perceived advantages and disadvantages. Overall, students appreciated the diverse perspectives TsGCs provided and the learning opportunities available when reviewing peers' drafts, receiving feedback, and listening to my comments. Although students' lack of disciplinary knowledge was occasionally problematic, they still saw the utility of TsGCs. Students also outlined strategies they developed for giving feedback if their peers' papers were difficult to understand. Disadvantages identified included difficulties from mixed proficiency levels, time and format limitations, disciplinary distance, quality of peer comments, and cultural differences. I conclude with suggestions for addressing these disadvantages, focusing specifically on important considerations when using TsGCs with graduate students from diverse backgrounds.

Learning to writ during graduate school poses significant challenges for new graduate students. One such challenge is the erro neous assumption that undergraduate writing adequately prepares students for graduate-level writing (Brooks-Gillies et al., 2015) while another challenge is that students need to lean two disparate ets of writing expectations concurrentl (Palridge, 2018). Not only must new graduate students learn academic genres required in their graduate coursework, which may share similarities across disciplines (eg., as in abstracts, literature reviews, and personal statements), ut they must also ln field-specific nres required for their professional lives (e.g., lab reports in sTEM fields; swOT analyses in Business; esson plans in Education). lthough the conventions for these new genres may overlap or contradict one another, graduate students must ofen learn these expectations simultaneously.

To overcome these challenges students need multifaceted support, yet asstance may vary widely within and across institutions. To illustrat, Pinkert's (2020) study of graduate student writing support within the same American universty revealed major differences across departments. Some departments reported offering specific writing courses for graduate students whereas others did not. Aditionally, some departments relied on mentorships with faculty advisors to support students writing while other departments referred students to writing workshops. Similarl, Caplan and Cox's (2016) international survey of institutional upport for graduate communication uncovered multiple structures to support writing (e.g,credit and non-credit writing courses, varied writing center services, workshops, writing groups, and writing retreats), but these opportunities were not uniformly available across the partici pating insttions. That is, although universitie in some countrie offered a broad range f writing suport structure, universities in other countries offered only a few services.

Within existing support structures, peer review is widely employed for providing feedback on writing. In writing courses, peer review involves two or more students reading each other's wrtten work and commenting on it using guidelines from the teacher (Baker-Smemoe, 2018). In writing center tutorials and workshops, reviewers (e.g, tutors, prs, or workshop instructors) may be speciall trained to repond to student writing. Although per review can build utonomy and collaboration skill as students rcognize how to improve their writing while working alongside peers, several factors may impede its suces, including peers lack of language knowledge, clashing cultural expectations, and, in classroom settings, teachers' lack of time, training, or currcular flexibility (Baker-Smemoe, 2018).

For many international graduate students, peer review may be a new concept, which they may only experience for the first time when participating in a writing course or other support serviceat their graduate institution. dditionally, ince international graduate students may be writing in an additional language (L2) and may be living in a new country for the first time, they have the extra burden of acquiring language and cultural norms alongside the conventions of new writen genres. Writing courses for international graduate students, therefore, must address multiple ssues, from genre awareness (Cheng, 2018) to language skils and cultural knowledge (Douglas, 2020) to successful participation in peer review. Given peer review's prominence in writing support systems and in academia, it is important that graduate students learn to engage in it effectively.

This article focuses on a non-credit, advanced academic writing course for international graduate students at an American university. Specificall, I llustrate how action research helped resolve a problematic peer review process in which students diverse backgrounds previously impeded success. Ater reviewing relevant literature, I describe the course context and intervention, present students' perceptions of the intervention, and conclude with implications for adapting the intervention for other contexts.

# 1. Literature review

# 1.1. L2 students' perceptions of peer review

L2 student' perceptions of peer review have been widely studied (Chang, 2016; Liu & Hansen, 2002). Chang's (2016) meta-analysis of studies published between 1990 and 2015 revealed several trends: (1) students preferred teacher feedback to peer feedback, (2) peer review cultivated writers' audience awareness and fostered social relationships, and (3)students preferred peer feedback to self-evaluation. Chang (2016) also found that students' concerns about their peers language competency affected their perceptions of feedback quality and that students disliked vague comments and reviewers' over-emphasis on local errors. Lack of training and cultural isues also afect students perceptions of peer review (Yu & Lee, 2016). Yu and Lee's (2016) meta-analysis demonstrated that teacher scaffolding is essential for efective feedack training as are carefull designed feedback procedures. Research on cultural impacts has shown mixed results; some studies have shown that concerns for face or group harmony constrained students' participation in peer review (Carson & Nelson, 1996; Thonus, 2004) whileothers llustrated that students from different backgrounds could collaborate effectively (Bradley, 2014; Ruecker, 2011).

Research has also shown that peer review proceses (. giving fedbacks. reeing t affect studnts differently. For example Lundstrom and Baker (2009) found that students who only provided feedback improved their writing more than those who only received feedback. More recently, Cao et al. (2019) investigated 15 Chinese undergraduate students' perceptions of peer review processes and identified pecific value placement patterns within their perceptions. In the study, al students gave and received peer feedback; however, they valued these proceses ifferently ie, some students valued both giving and receiving feedback; some only valued reeiving feedback; some only valued giving feedback; and one student perceived no benefits from either process). Nearly half of students believed they benefitted from both giving and receiving feedback. The close nexus between reviewer and receiver (Cao et al., 2019, p. 106) was especially important since students used the knowledge mobilized as a reviewer to evaluate comments received from their pers. Students who only perceived benefits from receiving feedback felt thir comments to peers were unhelpful but learned from others' feedback; this was due to students' lack of confidence in their own language capabilities and their desire to save face. Students who only found benefit from giving fdback felt the opposite; these students doubted the utilit of comments received from peers, but they took their reviewer responsibility seriously and genuinely tried to help others. Cao et al. (2019) ague that \*successful peer review depends heavily upon students individual perceptions regarding how they can contribute to giving feedback and lern from comments y their eers (p. 110). This suggests that students atitudes towards pr review are crucial to its implementation in any context.

# 1.2. Peer review and graduate writing

Graduate-level pe review has received lttle empirical attention (Mangelsdorf & Ruecker, 2018; Yu & Lee 2016). Existing studies have considered both L2-L2 groupings (Hu & Lam, 2010; Li & Vandermensbrugghe, 2011; Poverjuc et al., 2012) and L2-L1 groups (Cheng, 2013; Crossman & Kite, 2012; Fredericksen & Mangelsdorf, 2014), and their results have varied. I some studies peer review aided students' writing development (Crossman & Kite, 2012; Fredericsen & Mangelsdorf, 2014; Hu & Lam, 2010; Li & Vander. mensbrugghe, 2011) whil in others, students doubted their L2 peers' abilit to provide useful feedback (Cheng, 2013; Fredericksen & Mangelsdorf, 2014; Poverjuc et al., 2012). Mangelsdorf and Ruecker's (2018) study of L2-L1 writers collaborating during a graduate-level writing workshop found that peer review generall raised students' rhetorical awareness and strengthen[ed] their understanding of genre conventions" (p. 4), but gaps in disciplinary knowledge and between academic levels occasionally prevented students from helping each ther. For example, being from different majors sometimes limited peers ability to understand the writer's paper. When gaps in students' academic levels existed (e.g, as in a Master's student working with an experienced PhD student), \*the peer review exchanges could be one-way rather than reciprocal" (Mangelsdorf & Ruecker, 2018, p. 16) as the more experienced writer provided more support to the less experienced peer.

Aligning with Mangelsdorf and Ruecker's (2018) findings, studies of writing center tutorials and interdisciplinary writing groups have shown that fcilitators' and peers discipline knowledge affct fedback provision. Dinitz and Harrington (2014) found that writing tuors who wre les familiar with a writer's iscipline wre lesswiling and ess able o provide quality feedback. Conversely, Colombo and Rodas (2021) documented both advantages and disadvantages of interdisciplinary writing groups. Major disadvantages included the stres group members experienced from spending extra time reading and comprehending their peers' texts along with doubts about the utility of their omments when they were unfamiliar with the writers field. One especially important advantage, however, was that writers needed to \*unpack what seem[ed] obvious' (Colombo & Rodas, 2021, p. 211) by keeping their readers background knowledge in mind. In their study, disciplinarity (i.e., the knowledge needed for a specific academic field) was an important factor when organizing writing groups. The authors concluded that f the disciplinary distance between writer is not too vast, such distances can offer fruitful opportunities for learning during peer review.

# 1.3. Teacher-student group conferences

To address peer review's drawbacks, some scholars have advocated for a hybrid model incorporating the teacher. Although many labels have described this model (e.g., group confernce (Keh, 1990; Miler, 2002), intructor-led eer conference (Ching, 2011, 2014), peer reviews with h instructor (Liu, 1998), small goup writing conference (Thomas, 1986), techer-studet goup confeence (Zhu, 1995), Yeh (2019) states that the processis essentially the same: (1) the teacher schedules a meeing with a group of students to talk about their writing (i.., a writing conference); (2)students share their writing with the teacher and their pees; (3) students read all peers drafts and write comments before the meeting, and (4) during the conference, the group reviews each writer's draft and provides suggestions. I adopt Zhu's (1995) term teacher-student goup conference (sGC) to describe the intervention used in my clas because it concisely captures the collaborative nature between teacher and students during the process.

TSGCs' advocates argue that the teacher's presence provides opportunities to scafold students' learning beyond those typically available during peer review and individual conferences. Ching (2014) outlines interaction types available in TsGCs, from those available during per review (reviewer-writer, reviewer-reviewer) and individual teacher conferences (teacher-writer) to those only possible via TsGCs (teacher-reviewer). He contends that the teacher-reviewer interaction allows students to apprentice into the peer reviewer role by observing the teacher's expert model. Not only can teachers demonstrate how to provide constructivefeedback, but they can also validate peer reviewers' comments and use questioning strategies to stimulate critical thinking about complex writing strategies (Ching, 2011). Several scholars have sugested using TSGs for peer review training (Keh, 1990; Liu, 1998; Ruecker, 2014; Zhu, 1995); however, like graduate-level peer review, TsGCs have received scant empirical attention. Most TSGC studies have occurred in undergraduate writing courses inthe United States (Ching, 2011; Millr, 2002; homas, 1986 Zhu, 1995). The foci of these studis have incdd: the techer scaffolding tnique (Ching, 2011), ovrall enefit fs (Millr, 002) interaction patterns amongst participants (Thomas, 1986), and effects of TsGCs as a training model for peer review (Zhu, 1995).

To my knowledge, only two studies have considered TsGCs with L2 writers: Liu (1998) and Yeh (2019). Yeh's (2019)study was conducted in an undergraduate English composition course at a Taiwanese university. She investigated how interaction patterns (reviewer-writer, reviewer-reviewer, instructor-reviewer, instructor-writer, and intructor-group) emerged across two TsGCs, in Which the same teacher met with different student groups. Although these sGCs contained separate pr and teacher response phases (i.e., the teacher only gave her feedback after all peers had finished), Yeh found teacher involvement in $8 0 \%$ of interactions. During the peer response phase, most interactions were unidirectional (i.e, reviewers gave feedback to the writer, but the writer rarely responded). Yeh (2019) suggests that future researchconsider participants perceptions of the proces and sCs effcts on students revisions.

Liu's (1998) study is particularly relevant as it concerned international students' perceptions of TGCs in a graduate-level writing course at an American university. He found that students had positive attitudes towards peer review in general, but they particularly liked rsGCs, which offered chances for varied fedback from peers and the instructor, helped students feel more confident judging their peers comments, and provided multiple opportunities to negotiate meaning. Liu (1998) also noted that rsGCs helped students "be careful, critical, and sensitie reviewers of others as well as their own papers (p. 238). Although he acknowledges the utilit of this approach, Liu suggests that students should have the opportunity to choose individual teacher conferences if desired.

As the studies reviewed above demonstrate, significant gaps exist in the literature on both graduate-level peer review and TSGCs. This study, therefore,contributes tothe paucit f reearch in both areas by investigating how Gs functioned in a writing course for international graduate students. My analysi focuses on students' perceptions of TsGCs as such perceptions have rarely been docu. mented yet are important for teachers to understand. Additionally, considering this special issue's purpose, Iillustrate how students perceptions can inform TsGC implementation in other contexts.

# 2. Methodology

I used action research (AR) to investigate rGCs utility in my graduate-level EAP writing course. AR is a self-reflective, critical, and systematic approach" (Burns, 2010, p. 2) to research that enables teachers to explore and address ssues in their contexts. AR typically involves a four-phase cycle (Plan -Act - Observe - Reflect) during which teachers identify a phenomenon of interes, design an intervention (i.e, a deliberate pedagogical change), implement and document the intervention, and scrutinize the intervention's effect. Afte rflecting on the data, teachers may revise the intervention and begin a new cycl or top completely. This paper presents an analysis of students' perceptions from my first AR cycle.

# 2.1. Context and identifying the problem

The course, an advanced academic writing classfor international graduate students, was taught twice per week over a 16-week semester in an EAP program at an American universty. The course was required for students who had been admitted to the university's graduate programs but did not meet the EAP program's exemptio criteria (e.g., exceeding benchmark proficiency scores on standardized tests or the intitutioal placement test). Although course enrollees wereal graduate students, their needs varied widely as they had diverse majors, L1s and prior educational experiences. Students pursuing Master's degrees and PhDs were enrolled in the same course, but they might be at different stages in their programs while taking the course. Students also took the writing course concurrently alongside required classes for their academic discipline.

The major course assignment was a Convention Analysis Project (CAP) in which students analyzed writing prompts and other texts in their discipline tobuild genre awareness. The CAP was initially created following Johns (1997); students were positioned as re. searchers whose job was to investigate writing expectations in their discipline. Over time, prior instructors adapted the CAP,taloring it to their personal preferences and students' needs. During my first semester teaching the course January-May 2020), I adopted CAP assignments the previous instructor had implemented (Table 1) but found Parts 2 and 4 problematic. During pee review, students felt that their classmates could not provide useful feedback because of te disciplinary knowledge needed to understand these assgnments. In final course evaluations, one student noted learn[ing] ittl from the peer review" while others suggested eliminating it because most "students are not proficient enough to evaluate writig of ther students" and being \*from different majors [.. [made] i quite difficult [...] to give an opinion on something that we are not familiar with."

# 2.1.1. The interventions

The next semester (August-December 2020), I implemented two interventions to address these isues: (1) reverting to the original CAP assignments and (2) utilizing online TGCs. Table 2 outlines the CAP assignments inFall 2020. Allstudents ssignments fllowed the same format, but the content related to students' majors changed. In this way, students were positioned as experts whose responsibility was to describe writing in their disciplines to outsiders.

TSGCs occurred four times throughout the 16-week semester (see Table 2). During each TsGC, I met with each group over Zoom, and we reviewed each writer's paper collectively for 1015 min. (illiland e al., 202) provides further details on the ss structure and facilitation onlin. Since the clas only met for 75 miutes twice per week, I could not conduct Gs excusively during ass time. TSGC groupings (Table 3) were based on students availability rather than major or proficiency levels because one group had to meet outside of classtime. During sGC weeks, students completed asynchronous work and only met synchronously during their scheduled TSGC time.

# 2.2. Research questions

My purpose was to understand students' perceptions and identify ssues related to implementing sGCs. Therefore, I explore the following questions.

1) Which aspects of TSGCs did students find valuable?   
2) How did students' confidence change throughout the TsGCs and after the course?   
3) What issues do students' perceptions reveal concerning the implementation of TsGCs?

# 2.3. Participants

pseudonyms. onsidering the importance of disciplinarit,I categorized students majors into thee areas: STEM, Busines, and Social Sciences (Table 3). sTEM majors comprised nearly half of the clas. Distinctions between students majors became relevant when analyzing the quantitative data (e.g., in Table 4).

# 2.4. Data Collection

This project began as part of a collaboration with other writing teachers in my institution; our overall goal to understand how TSGCs worked online. However, given the negative feedback I reeived in the previous course iteration, recognized TGs' potential for addressing problems secific to my clas (ie, discilinarity as a arrier to ucesful pr review). Data documenting TGs came from pre/post course surveys, post-TsGc feedback forms, post-course interviews, anonymous post-course evaluations, Zoom recordings, students writing, and my research journal. Because this paper focuses on students peceptions, I do not include analysis of Zoom recordings, students' writing, or my research journal.

# 2.4.1. Pre/post-course survey

As part of the collaboratie AR project, I administered pre/post surveys to compare my class experience to those of my colleagues. The research team designed both surveys collectiely and administered them via Google Forms. The pre-course survey colected in formation about demographics, students' prior educational experience, their confidence writing in English, and their hopes for the semester. The post-course survey asked about students' confidence writing in English, their experiences in rsGCs, and what they improved the most during the semester. Each survey took approximately $1 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ to complete.

# 2.4.2. Post-TSGC feedback form

After each TsGC, students submitted a feedback form, which took approximately $1 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ to complete. I designed the form myself and adapted it for each TsGC after analyzing data from the previous TGC. In this study, I report data from the forms collcted after TSGCs 2, 3, and 4 (3 forms total). These forms asked about timing e.g., time spent writing their draft and time spent leaving feedback), feeligs about the fdback proces(e., students' confidence while giving feedack, feelings while giving/reeiving comments, and the most difficult part of leaving comments), and the overall usefulness of each TSGC.

# 2.4.3. Post-course interviews

Seven students (Arjun, Bai, Diu, Hana, Huy, Mu, and Rina) agreed to participate in interviews. Interviews lasted approximately 30 minutes and were conducted over Zoom by another research team member after my class ended. Appendix A contains the interview protocol, which the research team created collctively. Of the interview participants, Hana, Huy, and Rina had prior experience with both individual conferences and peer review.

# 2.4.4. Final course evaluations

The university collects anonymous course evaluations after each semester. These questionnaires contain closed- and open-ended questions and are used to compare the instructor's course to those of the department, the collge, and the university. Students completed these evaluations during the final week of class. Results were anonymous and only shared with me after final grade submission.

# 2.5. Data analysis

# 2.5.1. Pre/post-course survey and post-TSGC feedback forms

For the quantitative data in surveys and feedback forms, I calculated descriptive statistics for the whole cass for each close-ended question. I then recategorized this data according to students' enrollment status and their majors. For open-ended questions, I reorganized the responses by topic and calculated the number f responses for each topic.I asked an external reviewer to comment on my categorization of the open-ended responses to ensure accuracy of my interpretations. Finall, I created tables and figures based on these calculations.

# 2.5.2. Interviews

I transcribed interviews using Otter.ai and reviewed the transcripts for accuracy. Since these transcripts would become part of the larger data set for the cllaborative AR project, sectioned the transcripts acording to interview response (Geiser & Swarts, 2019). After uploding transcripts into Ats.ti, I coded them deductively using oncept codes from the interview questions eg., expectations for TsGs) and then inductively using descriptive codes (.g., helpfulnes of teacher) (aldana, 2016). nce I developed a preliminary code ist, I asked a reearch team member to code an example transcript and provide feedback, afer which I revised the code list and recoded the transcripts.

# 2.5.3. Final course evaluations

I used final course evaluations to triangulate students' perceptions. My analysis focused on three open-ended questions: two in which students identified course assgnments and activities that contributed to their language development and one in which students compared their language abilities before and after the class.

# 3. Findings

I report my findings according to my research questions, illustrating major themes by integrating data from multiple sources.

# 3.1. Valuable aspects of TSGCs

In the pre-course survey, most students $( 7 0 \% )$ indicated that they had previously participated in individual teacher conferences and peer review. Only three $( 2 3 \% )$ had prior experience in TsGCs. Overall, students' opinions about individual conferences and peer review aligned with the iterature. For example, students indicated that teacher feedack was more useful than peers', that peers comments were ineffective (e.g., I didn't get any meaningful comments from [my] partner." Joon), and that teacher feedback was more specific (e.g., t was useful beause I got very specific and direc omments from my instructor. Hana). ue, who had previously participated in TsGCs, outined their advantages and disadvantages: " can learn many things from everyone in the clas, but \*[it] always takes a long time."

As few students entered the course with prior experience in TsGCs, one of primary goals was to understand which aspects of TSGCSs students valued. n the ections below, I consider two thmes: (1) what students identified as most useful overall and (2) what students said they learned.

# 3.1.1. Most useful aspects of TSGCs

In the post-course survey, students listed the TsGCs' most useful aspects in an open-response question. Fig. 1 outlines their re. sponses, separated by enrollment level. PhD students said individualized feedback and new perspectives on their writing were most useful, but Master's students feedback varied. One Master's student mentioned listening to my advice to their peers, another mentioned listening to different opinions in general (i.e., not just opinions on their writing), and two students did not answer. Two students (one PhD and one Master's) mentioned learning new perspective from other disciplines. These results starkly contrasted with students' opinions in Spring 2020. That is students who experienced TsGCs in Fall 2020 stated explicitly that they found others opinions useful and, more spifill, that they lened nw perspective from student in ther disciplines. Thus, rather than viewing peers' diverse backgrounds as a barrier, some students saw different backgrounds as an asset.

During interviews, students corroborated and expanded upon some points raised in the post-course survey (ie., those presented in Fig. 1). For instance, to istrate the usfulnes of individualized feedback, Diu explaned, he goup conference [..] helps you to find your problem. It's not like in general. I think that's what I need' while Hana noted the importance of geting advice and new perspectives from peer.  hae ely god teamates, clamate [.] [h] gae e relly good avice. They're rel, ou know, yeah, they read carefully. And I can tell like, because they give me a very specific advice." Both Diu and Hana's comments highlight the importance of specificity, documented frequently in literature. Hana's comment also points to rapport and appreciation for peers which can greatly influence students' perceptions of peer review (Cao et al., 2019).

# 3.1.2. Learning from TSGCs

A key aspect of valuing TsGCs was students' abilit to articulate what they learned from the process I use interview data here to demonstrate how students described their learning, following some of Cao et al.'s (2019) categories (i., reviewing vs. rceiving).

Learning from Reviewing Peers Drafts. Huy, Mu, Arjun, and Diu described the benefits of reviewing others' draft. Huy observed specific language to adopt into his witig" learned a lot of things from reviewing [my peers'] work because there's some of sentences that I leaned from them its really helpful for my writing [..] like, how we argue, how we show our argument." Mu and Arjun, in contrast, noticed others organizational aproaches. Mu said:"[hen I read their paper, I can get the idea about how they're organizing or ow they writ [ ., so I can compare [. if hae some information or content missig, so I just ad to my part- my writ [what] I kind of learned from them." Similrly, Arjun elaborated." usedto read my clasmates papers .. o se [.] how they wrote their paper from my paper diffen. o th is takig diffent aroach. I mn dert aprch, n method. h, those are things I should know- organizations, or diffrent organization methods." Diu's comments reveal the deeper reflection that her peers' papers sparked:"Sometimes when I read others student's paper, and then compared to mine, I was like, Wow. That's really different. Why did they write like that? And why did I write like this?"

Here, students comments refect Baker-Smemoe's (2018) claim that peer review \*can help students develop greater autonomy and recognize how to improve their own writing" (p. 2). In addition, students' remarks about noticing the gap between their writing and their peers' work align with Lundstrom and Baker's (2009)'s finding that reviewers highly benefit from reading others' texts.

Learning from Receiving Comments. When describing the TsGCs most useful aspects, students mentioned that the TSGCs enabled writers to identify specific problems. Ofe, receiving comments from others facilitated these realizations. For example, Rina explained:

![](img/6aa03278bd8f074bba2d51f38765d40db3df355eefb113190ee3d527f63db37e.jpg)  
Fig. 1. Most Useful Aspects of TsGCs from Post-course Survey.

The comment about the topic sentence should be a littl shorter- That and the advice from Michelle about the body paragraphs organization,I think those two incorporated, so that's how I realized, "Okay, my weakness istend to put the topic sentence on the bottom." So, that kind of causes the unclear organization in the body paragraph.

Similarly after reviewing comments about his writing, Huy realized his problem with exemplification:"S]ometimes I don't really give the- an example for some of the things that listed in my esay. So yeah, they- sometimes they give me a comment that you should give an example to, you know, argue your argument." For Diu, organization was an issue, which she recognized ater reading others comments."[M]y thoughts- sometimes its lik jumping from one oint to another ... an its had for oter[s] [..] to understand. So by reading their comments, it can actually help me organize my thoughts, or organize the way that I write."

Mu and Arjun elucidated general realizations after reading others' comments. Mu remarked:"[T]here have some like comments I think reall useful [.. lik some information I mised in my wrig, something like that. I think, Oh, yeah, yeah. That's true. That kind of things." Arjun, in particular, recognized how the comments writers received could have benefits beyond just writing:"[W] henever I got some edits [..] I hould take t oitively beause that felt- I mean, that helped me to delop myself- to create a better version of myself."

These findings further corroborate the results in Fig. 1 from the post-course survey, in which students noted the utility of ind. vidualized feedback in the sGs along with the value of new perspectives on their writing. Thee results alo align with prior research showing that receiving comments raises students' rhetorical awareness (Mangelsdorf & Ruecker, 2018).

Learning from Listening to Comments. Since Ching (2014) emphasizes that the instructor-reviewer interaction is crucial in TSGCs, I wanted to understand what students gained from this interaction. Students mentioned learning from this in two ways: (1) by observing my feedback on students' writing and relating it back to their own writing and (2) by listening to my opinions about reviewers' comments.

Rina and Arjun explained that observing my comments helped them with their writing. Rina stated, [HJearing [..] Michelle's advice to [others'] writing helped me to understand more," while Arjun outlined how hearing fedback to his peers made him think critically about his own writing:

[W]e used to do similar kind of mistakes because we all are new in this, I mean, writing process and everything. So I used to [..] understand. Okay [..] obviously, I should pay attention whatever reviews [my peers were] getting because, I mean, so those are also wrong, right? I mean, probably I'm not doing that now, but I might do it in the future."'

Bai, on the other hand, specified how I helped her recognize parts of peers' papers she had previously missed:

[S]ometimes [.] I do not see [my peers] have their clear [road]map [sentence] over there, but actually they may have [..] one or two points So a good thing is like Michelle will point out, "Okay. Here, probably we can see what is it he wants to explain the following steps." [..] So we may point out, "I did not find this." But actually, they probably have one or two sentence, not perfect [...] So during the discussion, we'll learn.

Listening to my comments allowed Rina, Arjun, and Bai to notice the gaps in their writing or reviewing abilities. These findings align with Miller's (2002) argument that sGCs increase students' comprehension of the assgnment when they listen to comments made to other participants. The findings also support Ching's (2011)view of apprenticeship in TGCs, through which students learn to read and respond to writing like their teacher.

# 3.2. Changes in students' confidence

To addres research question 2,I consider two shifts: (1) students' confidence in their abilities as peer reviewers and (2) their confidence about academic writing overall.

# 3.2.1. Students' confidence in their abilities as peer reviewers

In the post-rsGc feedback forms, students rated how confident they felt leaving comments on their peers' papers on a scale of 1 (very unconfident) to 4 (very confident). Since students' perceptions of their L2 abilities can prevent them from giving feedback (Yu & Lee, 2014), I wanted to understand how this might have affected my students.

Table 4 shows students' confidence ratings acrossall rsGCs, with data separated by enrollment level and major. Comparing the collective clas total, students confidence increase with each rsGc. Although it is dfficult to infer reasons for this based solely on ratings, two factors might have contributed: (1) students' increased comfort with their peers and the sGC processand (2) students feeling more confident ater observing how others provided comments in prior rsGCs. Students in Social Science majors reported the largest increase in confidence across TGCs while one Business major (ai) reported feeling least confident efore TGC 4 I suspect Bai felt les confident because of s 4s writing assigment. AP Part 4 required analyzing language used in publications i., discourse analysis), which was a completely new approach to reading and analyzing text. During TsGC 4, Bai said she struggled to understand the assignment expectations. Therefore, it is unsurprising that she lacked confidence when providing feedback to others.

Beyond the confidence rating question discussed above, I included several open-ended questions about students feelings while giving fedback in the post-sGC feedback forms. Fig. 2 and 3 synthesize the answers to some of these questions. Fig. 2, which depicts how students felt while giving comments, reveals contradictory feelings. For example, the most mentioned items were general positive feelings (e.g., It feels great," or \*It is good.") and ambivalence (e.g., "No special feelings," or "Nothing particular."). Increased confidence was mentioned five times whil lack of confidence was mentioned four times. Students also saw giving fedback as an

opportunity to learn $( n = 5 )$ and a chance to help $( n = 4 )$

Interview data sheds further light on issues of confidence and helping peers that were uncovered in the post-TsGC feedback forms (i.e., Fig. 2). Related to lack of confidence, Arjun, Hana, and Mu explained in interviews why they sometimes avoided leaving comments. Arjun said, \*fI as unsure, I didn't used to comment [ just leave it for now-maybe we can discuss t in the class" while Hana remarked, I didn't point out for the mistake or [..] something I don't understand." In Arjun and Hana's cases, avoiding comments seemed to be a strategy for coping with writig they did not understand. Arjun's remark illstrates how discussions during TSGCs provided another outlet for writers to receive feedback if their peers felt uncomfortable providing it beforehand. Mu, conversely, specificall cited her lack of proficiency as a reason for avoiding some comments: I don't point out about grammar thing because I don't really[feel confident about my grammar knowledge. So yeah, everything about the vocabulary and the grammar, I just- I don't think I can help others." Concerning helping others, Hana explained, 'I enjoy doing that because [..] I'm not good at reviewing or d he fack for myself ut for th ther popl ca se from, ou kw, to beoetive, s clerly [] and r to be helpful." Although Hana sometimes avoided giving comments, she also recognized her evolving sills as a reviewer, particularly her ability to analyze others' writing objectively.

Fig. 3, which synthesizes data from post-rsGC feedback forms, outlines the reasons students gave for their dificulty providing feedback to peers. Students cited requirements in different part of the paper and being from different majors as the most common reasons. The second most mentioned dificulties were knowing what types of comments to make and formulating their thoughts. Other difficultis mentioned at similar frequencies included: understanding analysis points for the assignment, locating information in the paper, feeling uncertain about their comment's value, and understanding peers' writing overall.

Students expounded on these issues in interviews. For instance, Huy described struggling to formulate his thoughts at the beginning:\*The first time, I relly struggled how am I going to give them the feedback? Even I hae [.. the [analys] questions there, but sometimes it's not really clear on my mind. So yeah, it's kind of stressful."

Similarly, one of Bai's quotes encapsulates several issues mentioned in Fig. 3:

I think- give fedback, you can find from what you learn from the course, and the process to find something you think they can do better is easy. But difficulty is to give a suggestion on how they should revise because sometimes we even don't understand what is right [..] How can you give suggestion to your peers to say, "Oh, you probably change it this way is better." This is the hard part.

Here, Bai notes the contras between students' abilit to recognize a problem and thir ability to improve the issue. Even if students faced few of the issues listed in Fig. 3, they may stillstruggle to know what types of comments to make. This may have further contributed to students' uncertainty about the value of their comments.

To some extent, students lack of confidence may have resulted from shyness, as Mu explained, I don't like so many people like everything published something. I like private, so I fel like this kind of conf-like make me nervous." Other students, however, grew more comfortable with time. To illustrat, fter Huy explained his difficulties formulating his thoughts during early TsGCs, he remarked, \*[But you know, later on when we have a conference [..]Ican learn from other people's comments to, you know, how they comment on my draft Thus, despite his initial dificultie, Huy realized other participants comments could become model for feedback, which alleviated stress in later TSGCs.

Taken together, the data in this section reflect Colombo and Rodas (2021) observation that while students' anxiety about providing feedback may hinder their engagement at first, these negative feelings seem to subside with time, and students may feel more positively about the experience as they gain familiarity with their peers and their peers' disciplines.

3.2.2. Students' confidence in academic writing overall

Given the course's purpose, I wanted to understand whether students' overal confidence changed at the end of the semester. In the pre-course survey, when asked how confident they were writing in English for academic purposes on ascale of 1-5, students' average rating was slightly below neutral $\mathbf { \tilde { \rho } } _ { n } = 1 3$ $M = 2 . 9 2$ ${ S D = 0 . 7 5 9 }$ $M i n = 2 ,$ $M a x = 4$ . Table 5 separates these ratings by enrollment status and major, revealing that Master's students flt les confident than PhD students and that STEM majors were the most confident out of all groups.

Table 6 presents results from the post-course survey separated by enrollment status and major. Comparing Table 6 to Table 5, the collective class mean increased by nearly 1 increment, from 2.92 (slightl lessthan neutral) in the pre-course urvey to 3.73 (slightly less than confident) in the post-course survey. The min and max scores in Table 6 are especiall telling: no students selected 2 (unconfident) in the post-course urvey, yet this was a commonly chosen rating in the pre-course survey. Additionally, several students chose 5 (very confident) in the post-course survey although no students had selected this in the pre-course survey.

Lastly, although allgroups' confidence ratings rose in Table 6, marked differences existed between Master's students and nonSTEM majors. At the semester's end, Master's students felt more confident about their writing than Doctoral students while non. STEM majors' confidence ratings increased by one increment or more. Although sTEM majors were most confident out of all groups, their confidence ratings only rose by 0.58 increments. It should be noted, however, that these positive shifts cannot be attriuted specifically to sGCs as many factors may have impacted students perceptions. Other course components (e.g., language workshops) and writing projects outside of class might have affected students' confidence.

Nonetheles, students' comments in the final course evaluations offer further insights. One student wrote, the feedack I received from the instructor gave a lot of advantages for my writing" while two others cited rsGcs as activities contributing to their language development. Six students responded to the question, HJow would you compare your academic English today to the day you began this course?" Of those six four said their English had improved while two students provided detailed answers. One explained "feel[ing] more comfortale writing papers" while another wrote, While writing, I was able to figure out my tendency or weakness in writing an academic paper. So, I became aware of it, so that I won't make my writing les clear. Though I cannot specificall link changes in students' confidence to the TsGCs, it is heartening that the majority felt more confident at the semester's end.

# 3.3. Issues concerning the implementation of TSGCs

To addres research question 3, I consider several issues related to transferability to other contexts. Because these sues arose specifically from students' data, I include them in the findings rather than limiting them to the discussion.

# 3.3.1. Negative aspects of TSGCs

In an open-response question on the post-course survey, students identified the least useful aspects of TGs illustrated in Fig. 4). Major concerns were mixed proficiency levels, time needed for rsGCs, explaining one's discipline, peers being too quiet, and some comments lack of value. Other negative aspects that arose in interviews included cultural diffrences impeding feedback interpre. tation (Rina, Hana, and Bai),difficulties in mixed proficiency groups (Rina), and students wanting individual teacher meetings beyond TSGCs (Bai). Although negative aspects of rsGCs were mentioned les frequently than positie ones, they are worth considering in future course iterations and in other contexts. All of these issues corrspond to points raied previously in the literature; I return to them in the Discussion.

# 3.3.2. Students' perceptions of disciplinarity

As noted previously, disciplinarity is particularly important to graduate-level per review, my students expressed mixed attitudes towards disciplinarity. As Figs. 3 and 4 show, some students considered disciplinarit a barrier to giving feedback or as a general negative aspect of TsGCs. However, others found it useful (e.g., in Fig. 1).

In interviews, several students detailed the advantages of working with peers in different felds. Diu noted the benefit of having peers from divere fields read her paper: "[tudents from other fields in our group [.] when they're reading my paper- acording to those feedback they give me, I will know how people not in my field feel when they read my paper." Arjun expressed similar sentiments:

[People in my group] [.. are laymen in my fied and for themI am laymen in their ield..] I don't know anything about their field and their opinion als is like that. Maybe we will have a littleidea about our field, so our reference wil bedifferent and everything, and that gave me lots of different opinions, different view.

Bai, on the other hand, saw the benefits of listening to others' explain their majors:

[]ome students will share [..] Okay, I learned this new word," and before I never understand that they have more than two meanings. hey have different meaning and how to use. So, for this small thing, I think it's most interesing [..] because each of us have time to discover different field, and we learn some different new words.

Although the knowledge needed to understand writing in diverse disciplines likely presented its challenges, Diu, Arjun, and Bai found positie aspects of working with peers from varied majors. Due to logistical ssues, I could not always fllow Colombo and Rodas (2021) advice about disciplinary distance. However, the impact did not seem too great, particularly in groups 3 and 4 where disciplinary distance was larger. Bai's comment above ilustrates a similar finding to Mangelsdorf and Ruecker (2018) who note students raised their \*aware[ness of disciplinary differences in terminology and writing conventions (p. 14) after discussing work with peers in other felds. Overal, students interview comments support Colombo and Rodas (2021) findings that interdisciplinarity within peer

Fig. 4. Least Useful Aspects of TsGCs from Post-course Survey.

review can create learning opportunities.

# 3.3.3. Strategies for dealing with incomprehensible writing

Students' data also reveals an important aspect of peer review training: dealing with writing that i difficult to understand. Student described four strategie for coping with this: (1) avoiding comments, (2) using the analysis points from the asignment guidelines, (3) guessing what pers meant, and (4) stating their confusion directy. I previously described the avoidance strategy in my discussion of research question 2; thus, I outline students' discussion of other strategies below.

Most interviewees (Diu, Huy, Bai, Rina, and Mu) used the analysis points as a fedback guide. Diu elaborated, [T]he evaluation for [..] asked if this paper contains this kind of information or not [..] hen you read their paper, you will try to find those points, and if you can find it, great. If you cannot, just leave omments" whil Huy explaned, So ifI dont rell understand he content ill give them feedack about the structure. o is [.] the tructure i follow, for example, the APA style Or [..] the thesis statement is lear?" Similarly, Mu noted: 'So most thing, I think is gonna be the content or the- like [..] their strategy. Yeah. Like, what this paper asked for? Maybe they're missing some part of the information [and] I will point [it] out."

Beyond using the analysis points as a guide, Rina explained that guesing was another strategy she employed for deciphering her eers' writing:

Sometimes, I couldn't figure out what this paper wants to say [..] So, I made lot of gues. [..] Okay. Maye this person wants to convey the message like this." So I just [..] tried to make a good guess and then make a comment about [..] the things that we learned and the analysis points.

Diu also explained another strategy that was more direct. She elucidated:

If it's really onfusing, we can just writ [.. Oh, this part is a lie onfusing. I dont really understand. [.. then during the class, you can ask both students and Michelle, so it will help you to understand.

This data provides deeper insights into how students dealt with the diffculties they faced when making decisions about feedback In particular, it points to the importance of introducing students to specific strategies during training procedures. Both Arjun (in discussion of RQ2) and Diu mentioned raising their confusion during the sGCs, which would provide useful learning points as students discuss these ssues with the teacher. As I suggest in the next section, teachers should discuss these response trategies specifically with students during training.

# 4. Discussion

Overall, my students had mostly positive perceptions of rsGCs. They appreciated the individualized fedback and diverse per. spectives sGCs afforded and outlined how they learned from reviewing papers, receiving feedback, and istening to the my feedback. While students overall confidence as reviewers increased with each sc (Table 4), they explained a range of difficulties they faced while providing fdback (Fig. 3). Although disciplinarity was occasionally problematic, students stil felt rGCs were useful; some students even described their appreciation for students in other majors. Students also outlined strategies they developed for giving feedback to their per if the paper's content was difficult, a sil they will need in further graduate and professional work. These results align with Colombo and Rodas (2021) conclusion that interdisciplinarity can raise students' awareness about assumed background knowledge related to their academic field while exposing them to diverse topics.

Beyond the advantages of TsGCs, students also outlined the disadvantages all of which corresponded to existing literature. These included dificltiesaising from mixed proficiency levels, disciplinarystane, quality of pers comments, cultal dferences, and time/format limitations. Many of these issues could potentially be adressed via training (e.g., quality of comments and cultural differences) and grouping (e.g, proficiency levels and disciplinary distance). Liu and Hansen (2002) provided detailed practical guidelines for instructing students about peer review. For example, the authors explain how teachers should consider the afective, cognitive, sociocultural, and linguistic aspects of responding to peers. They also provide useful checklists for teachers prearing to use peer review in their classes.

Time and format limitations arose from using rsGCs as the main feedback strategy throughout the class. TsGCs were more time consuming than peer review and individual conferences (i.e., $3 0 { \mathrm { - } } 6 0 \ \operatorname* { m i n }$ depending on group size), yet writers only received 10-15 min f feedback. Beause of the imited ime alotted to each writr's paper, some students felt they could not ask allof their questions. As a result, some students expressed the desire for individual conferences with me so that they could ask further questions. Others wanted individual conferences because of concerns about privacy and shyness(as Mu previously remarked). Therefore, following advice from Lu (1998) and Keh (1990), I ugst ffering stdnts varit of fedack formats (from individual techer conferences, to TSGCs, or peer review) throughout the class if possible.

Because of the plethora of existing resources for peer review training, I focus on recommendations for using TsGCs with graduate students. In particular, I ugest focusing training on rapport uilding, disciplinarity, and strategy use. If using s in a classroom, keeping students in the same group can contribute to their rapport and appreciation for one another several of my students mentioned the importance f working with the same peers throughout the semester. To addres disciplinarit, I suggest having students develop a brief description of their major at the beginning of the term, which they could then use for later papers and converations. For students with lower proficiency lels, it would be useful to provide template phrases that students can adapt for their nees as they talk about their majors. Where possible, teachers should also try to reduce the disciplinary distance between students' majors when forming groups. In terms of strtegy use, it i crucial to instruct students about specfic trategies for responding to writing that is difficult to understand. Otherwise, students may resort to avoidance, as my students data has shown. As rsGCs advocates suggest, teachers should model how they comment on texts that are dificult to understand, particularly how teachers respond to content from unfamiliar disciplines. Tmplate phrases or sample questions would be useful (e.g., Could you explain what you mean by X? What does  mean in your field?) as would group practice with a sample paper. Although not an exhaustive lit, the above mentioned strategies can help teachers prepare international graduate students to successully engage in TsGCs and, thereby, support students' development as effective peer reviewers.
