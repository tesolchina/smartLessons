# ABSTRACT

Artificial agents, such as voice-controlled conversational agents (VCAs) built into smart devices, are becoming more prevalent in daily and educational contexts, enhancing the possibility of using them as language partners. However, research has primarily focused on the cognitive or affective outcomes of using these agents, overlooking questions about language learners’ perceptions of agents as human-like conversational partners and about what aspects of agents generate the social interaction schema required for language learning. To address these gaps, this exploratory study examined to what extent EFL students perceived a VCA as a human-like language partner and what knowledge regarding language partners these students used to justify their perceptions. Sixty-seven Korean EFL students, all of them being nine years old, completed three interactional tasks with a VCA designed to act as a language partner. They then participated in a drawing task and in-depth interview implemented to explore students’ perceptions toward the VCA as a language partner. Thematic analysis of students’ drawings and interview transcripts found that the majority of students identified human elements in the VCA, perceiving it either as a human-like partner or as something between artifact and human. This strong tendency toward anthropomorphism indicates ${ \mathsf { V C A s } } ^ { \prime }$ great potential as interactive language partners in EFL contexts. Additionally, this study discusses the reasons for and implications of students’ strong anthropomorphism tendency and how students used their knowledge regarding language partners to justify their VCA perceptions. Future recommendations for the use of VCAs were suggested from both pedagogical and technological standpoints.

# 1.  Introduction

In the field of language learning, research on artificial agents has been a subject of rapid growth due to their human-like interactional functionality. Scholars have introduced different types of artificial agents, including embodied agents such as physical robots (e.g., Alemi & Haeri, 2020) and on-screen virtual characters (e.g., Divekar et  al., 2021) or disembodied agents available through smart devices (e.g., Chen et  al., 2020; Dizon, 2021). Examples of the latter type of agents include intelligent personal assistants (IPAs), such as Siri for Apple or Alexa for Amazon Echo. Using different types of artificial agents, research has examined language learners’ interactions (Moussalli & Cardoso, 2020), the effects of those interactions on learning outcomes (Dizon, 2020; Tai & Chen, 2022), and the extent to which learners perceive the use of agents as beneficial for various aspects of language learning (e.g., willingness to communicate, motivation, or anxiety) (Chen et  al., 2020; Jeon, 2022; Tai & Chen, 2020).

Meanwhile, despite the social nature of artificial agents, there has been less interest in learners’ perceptions of the agents themselves as human-like language partners. Specifically, studies that examine how L2 learners understand disembodied agents and whether they perceive these agents as human-like language partners are much scarcer. The need for such research, however, has surged, as disembodied agents, particularly voiced-controlled conversational agents (VCAs) on smartphones and speakers, are becoming prevalent at an ever-increasing rate in both daily and educational contexts. Forecasts predict that the total number of existing voice agents will reach 8.4 billion units – a number larger than the world’s population (Vailshery, 2021). More importantly, such research is needed because learners’ perceptions of VCAs as language partners can provide insight into how learners will incorporate these technologies into their language learning.

Therefore, it is timely and significant to investigate learners’ perceptions of VCAs as language partners and to understand the reasons for those perceptions. This qualitative study aims to fill this research gap by exploring how a group of nine-year-old Korean EFL learners understand VCAs as language partners through a drawing task and an in-depth semi-structured interview.

# 2.  Literature review

# 2.1.  The potential of VCAs as human-like language partners

Artificial agents have been extensively investigated in a variety of research domains, including education (e.g., Davis et  al., 2021). The basis for using these agents is the human tendency to infer human characteristics even in non-human objects such as artificial agents, a phenomenon known as anthropomorphism (Heider & Simmel, 1994; Lee et  al., 2020). Research indicates that anthropomorphism enables people to comprehend an object’s internal state (e.g., personality) and thus promotes deep comprehension of their experience with the object (Heider & Simmel., 1994).

The three-factor theory of anthropomorphism introduced by Epley and colleagues explains how a specific person’s tendency for anthropomorphism is determined (Epley et  al., 2007); thus, providing a useful framework for understanding language learners’ perceptions of VCAs as human-like partners. According to the theory, people anthropomorphize an agent to varying degrees because they use their own experiences to justify the agent’s behaviors and to reason about its mental states; they ascribe the agent different mental states based on their experiences. Specifically, the theory postulates that the degree of anthropomorphism is decided by one cognitive and two motivational factors: elicited agent knowledge, effectance, and sociality (Epley et  al., 2007). Elicited agent knowledge is determined by a person’s knowledge both about humans and nonhuman agents. For example, when knowledge regarding a nonhuman agent increases, it replaces knowledge about humans that was previously used to understand the agent; thus, the anthropomorphism tendency decreases. Motivational factors also play as crucial a role as the cognitive factor in the process of anthropomorphism. Effectance is a motivational factor and is enhanced when a person feels a strong need to interact effectively with an agent. Sociality is related to a person’s desire for social contact and affiliation. Sociality is enhanced when a person is situated in an environment where available social connections that the person desires are limited. This process of anthropomorphism does not imply that humans consider the target object as a real human, but rather that they continue to attribute a human mind to the object because this attribution helps them develop more effective comprehension regarding the object, even when they are aware that it is not a living being (Lee et  al., 2020).

Another line of studies has supported the use of agents in education by exploring the degree to which an agent’s design features (e.g., facial expressions, gestures, and voice) promote social perceptions in students (for a review, see Davis et  al., 2021). Given that VCAs communicate with students through voice, research on how voice type influences students’ social perceptions of agents may help explain VCAs’ potential as human-like language partners. Unlike earlier research that confirmed the superiority of a human voice over a computer voice in facilitating social perceptions (Atkinson et  al., 2005; Mayer et  al., 2003), recent research has established that modern text-to-speech technology has advanced significantly and is capable of facilitating some aspects of social perceptions to a degree comparable to a human voice (Chiou et  al., 2020; Craig & Schroeder, 2017; Davis et  al., 2019). Specifically, using the Agent Persona Instrument (Baylor & Ryu, 2003), research has shown that modern computer voice is perceived to be as effective as a human voice in terms of facilitation and credibility but less effective in human-likeness and engagement (Chiou et  al., 2020; Craig & Schroeder, 2017).

However, as noted by Davis et al. (2021), existing voice-related research has mostly focused on pedagogical agents that deliver content in a one-way manner, providing limited implications for conversational agents commonly used in the EFL environment for two-way interaction. In the EFL classroom, the dialogic interaction in L2 serves as the task itself, which is ‘different from systems that only deliver instruction or commands through an agent.’ (Bibauw et  al., 2019, p. 833). In other words, conversational agents in language learning act as relational interlocutors using two-way interaction, whereas pedagogical agents in other domains primarily serve as content providers (Bibauw et  al., 2019). Given this difference, we can assume that language learners might have different social expectations of agents as learning partners from those in other educational fields. Considering the fact that people’s reasoning about a nonhuman agent, such as VCAs, is based on relevant representations of humans (Epley et  al., 2007; Rips, 1975), previous research on the characteristics of effective human language partners, particularly L2 language teachers, may provide useful guidelines for exploring language learners’ perceptions of agents as language partners.

Faranda and Clarke (2004) discovered that students expect five characteristics from an effective teacher: rapport, delivery, fairness, knowledge and credibility, and organization and preparation. Barnes and Lock (2013) found that when these five attributes were applied to language learning, language learners valued the delivery attribute the most, followed by the knowledge and credibility, and rapport attributes. In particular, interpersonal statements such as ‘[effective language teachers] develop good relationships with students’ for the rapport attribute and ‘use good examples’ for the delivery attribute received higher scores from students in the survey. Similarly, Ahn and West (2018) revealed that language learners emphasize interpersonal qualities when determining what makes a good language teacher (e.g., accessibility and approachability). These findings corroborated previous research (e.g., Park & Lee, 2006) and provided evidence for the highly social nature of language tutoring (Darvin & Norton, 2015). Overall, these studies shed light on relevant human knowledge that language learners could apply when attempting to understand VCAs designed to assume the role of language partners.

# 2.2.  Learners’ perceptions toward VCAs

Since first theorized as language learning tools (Fryer & Carpenter, 2006), conversational agents have been proved to provide positive outcomes for learners in terms of both cognitive and affective aspects. Agents’ cognitive effects on vocabulary acquisition (Jeon, 2021), speaking or listening skills (Dizon, 2020; Hsu et  al., 2021; Tai & Chen, 2022), and more broadly, overall second language proficiency (Bibauw et  al., 2019; Divekar et  al., 2021) have been revealed. In addition, according to research, using conversational agents enhances affective variables such as willingness to communicate in L2 (Ahmadi et  al., 2017; Tai & Chen, 2020), L2 confidence (Chen et  al., 2020; Jeon, 2022), and interest in language courses (Fryer et  al., 2019).

Along with recent advances in speech technology and the proliferation of smart speakers, language scholars have focused their attention on VCAs, particularly on user perceptions of them concerning various aspects of language learning. In particular, prior research indicates that students had positive perceptions toward the use of VCAs for L2 learning (e.g., Jeon, 2022; Hsu et  al., 2021). For instance, Dizon (2020) discovered that after a ten-week in-class treatment in which students interacted with Amazon Alexa, students perceived the use of the VCA to be beneficial and enjoyable for L2 learning. Similarly, Chen et  al. (2020) examined how university students with different levels of language proficiency perceive Google Assistant and discovered that participants, regardless of their proficiency level, had overall positive attitudes toward the VCA. The students perceived the VCA’s utterances as natural and understandable and believed that the VCA would assist in the development of L2 skills. Additionally, Tai and Chen (2020) found that high school students became more willing to communicate with a VCA than with peers using L2, indicating that they formed favorable attitudes toward the VCA as a learning tool. In sum, research shows EFL students’ positive perceptions toward VCAs for L2 learning across a range of school-level and language proficiency, demonstrating the tool’s potential as an effective learning tool.

While these studies hightlight the value of VCAs as instructional tools, there is a significant research gap in the literature: the social nature of VCAs. That is, in light of prior research, artificial agents have been primarily positioned as agents capable of engaging in social interactions and actively building and maintaining social relationships rather than simply remaining as machine-like tools. For instance, as demonstrated in several studies of human-machine interaction (e.g., Kory-Westlund & Breazeal, 2019; Seneff et  al., 2004), various types of communication patterns observed in human-human interaction also occur in human-machine interaction, including human-VCA interaction (Chen et  al., 2020; Moussalli & Cardoso, 2020). Additionally, when agents are perceived to be more human-like, people tend to view them more positively, collaborate with them more effectively, and empathize with them more than when agents are perceived to be less human-like (e.g., van den Berghe et  al., 2021; Xu & Warschauer, 2020a). Therefore, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of VCAs as language tools, it will be critical to acquire specific knowledge about whether and in what aspects L2 learners perceive VCAs as human-like social partners. Indeed, some research in the field of VCA technology has already explored how users perceive VCAs as social partners in everyday contexts. For instance, Lee et  al. (2019) analyzed the perceptions of 31 individuals ranging in age from four to 51 who had prior experience with VCAs. Each participant classified a VCA into one of the four categories: human, speaker, system, or space object. In a similar vein, Druga et  al. (2017) investigated children’s perceptions of VCAs. They observed that younger children aged three to four attempted to understand the agent as a person, whereas older children aged five to 10 tested the agent’s identity by asking a series of questions to determine whether the VCA was human or artifact. Although these studies were not conducted in educational settings, they illustrate that VCA’s social nature could make them effective learning partners.

Meanwhile, being more relevant to the current study, a small but growing number of language researchers have noted the possibility of using VCAs as language partners by examining learner perceptions of VCAs as language partners, particularly for young learners. Xu and Warschauer (2020b) investigated how young learners perceived a VCA when it was used as a language learning partner. After the children completed interaction tasks similar to language activities, they conducted a drawing task and an in-depth interview where students described the VCA. The descriptions were then assigned into three categories: artifact, residual, or living being. The authors noted how age influenced the children’s perceptions of the VCA, revealing that the children older than six did not anthropomorphize the VCA. Similarly, Girouard‐Hallam et  al. (2021) stated that young children around the age of six might be more likely than older children to view new interactive technologies as social partners and thus seek to learn from them. These studies are significant because it has revealed specific learner perceptions of VCAs, as well as underlying knowledge that can be used to guide the development and integration of VCAs for the support of learners. However, it is worth noting that these studies were conducted in an L1 environment; thus, the literature did not provide specific insights into students studying in an EFL setting.

Given environmental differences such as a scarcity of interlocutors who speak the target language or other affective factors such as L2 speaking motivation or anxiety, we can assume that EFL students’ perceptions of VCAs as language partners differ significantly from those of L1 learners (Epley et  al., 2007). Despite this contextual difference, little research existed on EFL students’ perceptions of VCAs as language partners, particularly regarding agents for smart devices. To address this gap in the literature, and in light of the fact that our pedagogical understanding of VCAs is still in its infancy, this study conducted a qualitative examination of a group of nine-year-old EFL learners’ perceptions toward VCAs as language partners and their specific justifications for those perceptions. The investigation was guided by the following research questions.

1. What are primary school EFL students’ perceptions of a VCA as a language partner?   
2. What knowledge regarding language partners do these students use to justify their perceptions?

# 3.  Methodology

# 3.1.  Participants

Sixty-seven nine-year-old students (37 females, 30 males) were recruited from one primary public school in South Korea. The researchers received formal permission for the research from the school and each learner and their parents before participation. All the participants spoke Korean as their L1, and they had a wide range of EFL learning experiences from two to six years, but none of them had experience studying abroad in an English-speaking country. The results of diagnostic tests administered at the beginning of the semester, where the participants had a 10-minute-long conversation with a teacher who speaks English as L1, were used to decide the participants’ English proficiency. As a result, we confirmed that all participants were able to perform basic functions in English, such as greeting friends or simply expressing favorites, and that they belonged to the novice level according to American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) guidelines for speaking and listening (ACTFL, 2012). Regarding VCA use experience for non-language learning purposes, eight students had never interacted with any agent system, 10 had used a VCA once or twice, and 49 students had done so often, according to parent reports. We also asked parents if students had experience utilizing VCAs for language learning; two students were confirmed to have used VCAs for language learning two to three times.

# 3.2.  Agent development

We developed a VCA that can provide similar peer-activity experiences to those of a typical L2 classroom. To this aim and considering participants’ English proficiency, we first designed different types of peer activities, such as small talk activities where students greeted or talked about the weather or hobbies with each other in English and information-gap task activities where participants were required to negotiate meanings using English to complete the tasks (Ellis, 2003). Next, the tasks were examined by five in-service EFL primary school teachers to confirm if the tasks mirrored primary-school-level EFL activities or needed any adjustment. Consequently, three task scenarios were chosen and finalized for the agent creation process (see Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2). Next, as recommended in Chen et  al. (2020), we used Google’s Dialogflow to code the selected scenarios into the VCA. By using this platform, we could enhance the interactivity and the pedagogical usefulness of the agent for language learning (Chen et  al., 2020). Specifically, following the VCA design structure used in Xu and Warschauer (2020a), the VCA for the current study was created to provide two different sets of responses depending on student input: Feedback for recognizable input and Prompt for unrecognizable input (see Figure 1). First, students were required to initiate a conversation by using questions presented in a worksheet (see Appendix). Next, the VCA was designed to answer the initial question and then ask the same question to the student. If the student input was understood by the VCA, whether categorized as correct or partially correct, the VCA provided feedback to the input and advanced the conversation. If the VCA could not understand the student input, the VCA was designed to provide a Prompt to indicate non-understanding and then to provide feedback again based on the student’s following response. If the VCA did not understand student input for the Prompt more than three times, the VCA provided vague, generic feedback in order to move the conversation forward. Regarding the feedback type, the agents were programmed to provide affective or, in some cases, corrective feedback, and to remember some parts of student responses depending on the student input.

The VCA software was then integrated into Google Assistant operating on a Google Home Mini device. Among the different voice options available in Google Assistant, the option titled Red was selected for all VCAs used in this study. This voice option is one of the newly released computer-generated voice options that were created with state-of-art text-to-speech and speech synthesis technologies by DeepMind. This voice aims to provide users with a more human-like voice with great pitch and pacing (Ward, 2019). In total, students could complete the three tasks through oral interaction with the VCA in 20 to 30 minutes. Details for each activity are found in the following sections.

# 3.2.1.  Small talk activity

In this activity, children and the VCA communicated about their name, favorite color, and favorite animal. The conversation was initiated by a student asking questions presented on a worksheet (see Appendix). The VCA answered the question and then asked the same question to the student so that the student could answer as well. For example, when a student asked, ‘What color do you like?’ the agent answered, ‘I like yellow, how about you?’ When the student answered with a specific color, such as green or yellow, the agent repeated the color saying, ‘You like green? I like that color too!’ or ‘Yellow? We like the same color!’ In cases where the VCA failed to recognize voice input, the VCA provided prompts such as ‘Sorry, I did not catch that. Can you please say that one more time?’ When the VCA failed to understand more than three times, the VCA provided more general responses and moved the conversation forward (e.g., ‘Great! It was a nice conversation. Let’s talk about animals now.’)

# 3.2.2.  Information gap activities

After the first activity, students conducted two information gap activities. First, looking at the provided worksheet, students needed to find appropriate spots to place various things, such as a bag and a hat. For example, when the student asked, ‘Where is the hat?’ the VCA answered, ‘It is under the desk’ and then said, ‘Where is the umbrella?’ This time, the student provided information to the VCA by using the information presented on the worksheet. When the student provided a partial answer, the VCA was programmed to provide corrective feedback such as ‘Did you say on the desk or under the desk?’ When the student successfully finished the task, the VCA provided affective feedback, such as ‘Wow, your English is very good!’ When the VCA failed to recognize voice input, a similar mechanism as applied in the small talk activity was also applied. In the second information gap activity, the students participated in a What am $I ?$ game where the VCA gave hints one by one, and the student guessed the answer. A similar interaction mechanism as used in the first information gap activity was applied to the second activity as well. Figure 2 displays sample transcripts of user-agent (student-VCA) interactions.

# 3.3.  Procedures

The procedures for this study consisted of two main stages. First, each student met individually with one of the researchers in a designated and quiet area at the student’s school. The researcher introduced the interaction tasks listed above with relevant instructions, and said, ‘Please, study English with this Google.’ The researcher only interfered if the student had technical issues. After the interaction tasks with the VCA were completed, all of the students participated in a drawing task and then a semi-structured interview that was administered by the same researcher. The purpose of the two tasks was to explore students’ in-depth perceptions of the agent as a language partner.

# 3.4.  Data collection and analysis

After interacting with the VCA, students were given a double-sided sheet designed to collect both visual and written descriptions of the agent. On the front side, the sheet had space for the students’ biographical information and a blank space for drawing their image of the VCA. The prompt for drawing was developed based on the previous literature (Lee et  al., 2020; Xu & Warschauer, 2020b); students were asked, ‘Imagine and draw the image of Google you were talking to.’ Next, on the backside, students were asked to provide detailed information regarding their drawings. They were prompted to explain the VCA’s features, particularly focusing on two aspects: the VCA’s strengths and weaknesses as a language partner, and how much they liked or disliked the experience and why. The use of a visual method, such as the drawing task in this study, is widely employed to explore learners’ internal states toward an abstract topic in contemporary research (Ahn, 2021).

Next, the semi-structured interview was conducted to confirm and deepen the understanding provided by the drawings and written descriptions. The interview was conducted with a particular emphasis on students’ struggles to provide detailed written descriptions of their drawings or to clarify certain points in their drawings through their written descriptions. Each interview lasted from 11 to 27 minutes. The interview questions included ‘Can you explain your drawing?’ ‘How do you think of Google in your drawing as a language partner?’ and ‘Can you tell me about the good or bad things about it?’ The data collection process was conducted in students’ L1 and audio-taped. The audio files were then transcribed verbatim for subsequent analysis.

For data analysis, a hybrid approach of thematic analysis was adopted (Braun & Clarke, 2006). This type of thematic approach employing both a deductive and inductive process is considered suitable when a research topic with abundant empirical and theoretical data (e.g., effective teachers) is applied to an emerging field (e.g., VCAs as language teachers), as is the case with this present study (Xu & Zammit, 2020). Regarding the deductive process, the relevant frameworks outlined in the previous studies were consulted to initially inform and formulate the basis for potential themes. Given the novelty of the topic and the exploratory nature of the research, a data-driven inductive process was also performed. Codable categories were identified from the students’ responses to the data collection tools and used to refine initial themes.

More specifically, regarding VCA perceptions, we identified three themes: human, artifact, and a residual category assigned for any description that was neither artificial nor human. For this, we referenced the framework used in the previous study (Xu & Warschauer, 2020b); we identified further codable categories regarding the details of specific perceptions such as gender or origin within each theme through inductive analysis.

Next, regarding how students explained their perceptions, we identified four themes, referencing the frameworks used in the studies on effective language partners (Ahn & West, 2018; Barnes & Lock, 2013; Park & Lee, 2006): a student response from either the drawing task or semi-structured interview was categorized as rapport if the student mentioned an emotional aspect regarding their relationship with the agent (e.g., ‘It is friendly,’ ‘We can have good relationship,’ or ‘It does not care about me.’); delivery if the student statement was related to pedagogical aspects or communication styles (e.g., ‘It gives clear explanations,’ ‘It can teach well,’ or ‘It speaks too fast.’); credibility if the student comment was focused on the VCA’s qualifications for language teaching (e.g., ‘It has great English pronunciation,’ ‘It knows lots of vocabulary,’ or ‘It doesn’t have Korean knowledge’); availability if the student comment was related to the agent’s accessibility or preparedness for learning (e.g., ‘We can study anywhere and at any time’ or ‘If it breaks, we can’t use it anymore.’). Each theme was then divided into two sub-categories: positive and negative, resulting in eight total sub-categories. The frequency of each code was calculated to examine overall tendencies regarding student perceptions. Multiple comments from one student categorized into the same sub-category were only counted as one. Afterward, the drawing data were re-examined to select the most appropriate pieces to represent the themes. The researchers carefully consulted all drawings and presented them along with student comments.

# 4.1.  Students’ perceptions of a VCA as a language partner

As in Table 1, 11 students $( 1 6 . 4 \% )$ depicted the VCA as a human (see Figure 3a). Ten students indicated that they recognized the agent as female. Ten students depicted the VCA as an English teacher, characterizing them as pretty, friendly, and generous, while one drew the agent as a male peer, describing it as friendly. While four students explicitly indicated that the agent was an English teacher from the United States, the other students did not specify the country of origin. In addition,

Figure 3. D rawing samples. a. Samples that illustrate the VCA as a human. b. Samples that illustrate the VCA as an artifact. c. Samples that illustrate the VCA as an in-between object

19 students $( 2 8 . 4 \% )$ classified the VCA as an artifact (see Figure 3b). They illustrated the agent as computer chips $( \mathtt { n } = 7 )$ , smart devices such as phones or speakers $( \mathtt { n } = 8 )$ , or toys $\left( \mathrm { n } = 4 \right)$ that needed human intervention to work. Finally, as Figure 3c shows, more than half of the students $\left( \mathrm { n } = 3 7 , \ 5 5 . 2 \% \right)$ depicted the VCA as something that could not be clearly classified as either human or artifact. The agents in this category had both mechanical and human characteristics, such as a human figure with an AI chip within its brain or robots made of metal but with human bodies and hence the abilities to move, see, and communicate just as well as a human.

# 4.2.  Knowledge regarding language partners students ascribed to the VCA

We then investigated how students ascribed their knowledge regarding language partners to the VCA. Overall, positive comments $\mathbf { \tilde { n } } = 1 0 0 \mathbf { \Psi } ,$ ) outweighed negative comments $\left( \mathtt { n } = 6 3 \right)$ ). Many of the student responses $\mathrm { ( n = 6 7 ) }$ ) were focused on the delivery attribute, positive or not. The positive attributes that were ascribed to the VCA as a language partner most frequently mentioned by students were categorized as the credibility $\left( \mathrm { n } = 3 2 \right)$ and rapport $( \mathtt { n } = 1 9 )$ ) attributes, whereas the negative aspects of the agent were largely confirmed to be associated with the delivery $\left( \mathrm { n } = 3 7 \right)$ and availability $\left( \mathtt { n } = 1 5 \right)$ attributes. Among the four categories of attributes, the credibility attribute was perceived as the most positive characteristic of the VCA as a language partner, independently of perception category. Most students said that the VCA had ‘clear English pronunciation,’ ‘great English skills,’ and an ‘intelligent brain,’ for example. Their monolingual feature (i.e., inability to speak Korean) was perceived to be a negative characteristic within the credibility attribute. With the exception of credibility, student attributions differed dramatically according to VCA perception category, as shown in Table 2.

# 4.2.1.  VCAs as human-like language partners

Conceiving the VCA as a human, most of these students made positive comments $\left( \mathrm { n } = 2 5 \right)$ ), which outnumbered negative ones $\left( \mathrm { n } = 4 \right)$ , particularly regarding the rapport attribute. These students described the VCA by using words that are generally used to describe humans, such as kind, generous, and engaging. Some students elaborated more on this aspect by specifically talking about the affective and corrective feedback they received from the agent. In the interviews, S1 said, ‘I could try speaking English comfortably because it said I was doing well.’ Similarly, S3 commented, ‘It gave me some hints; so, I did not feel worried about English. I think it is really like a kind teacher.’ Next, students who described the VCA as engaging appreciated the existence of the agent itself as a language partner. They expressed their desire to build a relationship with someone who is fluent in English, stating that the agent could satisfy this need. For example, S4 stated, ‘I like the Google teacher because it would be good to have someone who is good at English around me.’ S1 made a similar comment, stating that she wanted to have a native English teacher like Google. Concerning negative comments regarding the rapport attribute, one student noted, ‘It may take some time and energy to get to know and become familiar with it since there will be a lot of information that I need to share’ (S8).

In addition, regarding the delivery attribute, students commented on the effectiveness of the instructional technique and communication abilities that the agent displayed. For example, one student said, ‘It can teach what I don’t know in a simple manner’ (S5). They also identified its communication skill as an important strength for a language partner. One student stated, ‘It can communicate well, so it can explain like an English teacher.’ In sum, the students who conceived the VCA as a human tended to perceive it as a companion with whom they could interact, although some $\left( \mathtt { n } = 2 \right)$ still complained that it did not always comprehend their words.

# 4.2.2.  VCAs as complete artifacts for language learning

Nineteen students regarded the VCA as a complete artifact similar to a computer chip or a toy gadget. Viewing the agent as this type of artifact, none of the participants expressed positive perceptions about the rapport attribute. Rather, the students elaborated on the rapport attribute using negative words. That is, they regarded their language partner’s emotionlessness as a weakness. Five specifically stated that the VCA did not care about them and was emotionally incapable of responding. Six students stated that the VCA, as a complete machine, was incapable of comprehending their emotions. For instance, S7 mentioned that ‘it cannot know anything about me, such as my birthday or school number […] because it is a machine.’

Additionally, this perceived lack of emotion in the agent was made clear in how the agent’s delivery attribute was perceived. Fifteen students stated that they would be unable to conduct a natural conversation with the VCA due to the artificial communication operations that they experienced during the VCA tasks, such as misrecognition, unnatural pauses, and a mechanical voice. In general, this lack of human elements prevented students from perceiving the VCA as an interaction partner. Furthermore, when describing the agent’s positive characteristics regarding the delivery attribute, students emphasized ‘teaching vocabulary’ as a strength rather than focusing on interaction capabilities. These students did not view the VCA as a conversational partner but rather as something more suited to providing one-way instruction for transmitting English knowledge.

Next, seven positive remarks were identified as positive characteristics regarding the machine-like VCA’s availability attribute. For example, the

VCA was described as convenient, easy to carry, and easily accessible. ‘I can turn on my phone and ask it questions, and it will always respond quickly,’ S9 stated. On the other hand, some expressed concern about the machine’s brittleness. For example, they commented, ‘We need to be cautious using it since it could break very easily, and it is not water-proof,’ or ‘If it breaks, we won’t be able to use it.’

In summary, students who envisioned the VCA as a complete machine viewed it as a knowledge-transmission tool that lacked interaction capabilities similar to an online dictionary. The students’ perceptions were formed as a result of their recurring encounters with misrecognition or awkward communication pauses. Additionally, there was an impression that the VCA could be both convenient and fragile, which were characteristics not identified in the remarks of students who viewed the VCA as a human.

# 4.2.3.  VCAs as something between human and artificial language tool

More than half of the students $\left( \mathrm { n } = 3 7 \right)$ drew the agent as something that possessed both human and mechanical elements at the same time. Similar to their combined perceptions, when asked to explain their drawing, their accounts were also found to include both elements.

First, eight students considered the agent to possess social properties, which is similar to the responses from students who perceived the VCA as a human. The students viewed the agent almost like a human, particularly regarding the rapport attribute. Eight students identified this social nature as the agent’s strength as a language partner. For example, S10 stated, ‘It is not a complete human or machine, but it can feel something like a human; so, we can become closer to each other.’ Even when the students commented on negative characteristics regarding the rapport attribute, their tendency to treat the agent like a human remained unchanged. For instance, two students stated that if people used the VCA too much, the VCA could suffer mentally, so they recommended not using it too often. Some students placed a greater emphasis on its mechanical components rather than on its human components when commenting on the rapport attribute. One student stated that the agent has a unique punishing function that can be used to ‘punish or hit them,’ (S12) when he does not study hard. In summary, when the agent was perceived in the residual category, it was considered to possess social properties and to be capable of some degree of interaction.

Next, a majority of students noticed both the VCA’s positive and negative aspects regarding the delivery attribute. Comments on the positive aspects of the delivery attribute included the following: ‘It can explain what I don’t know very well,’ ‘It can communicate well,’ and ‘It can answer my question very quickly and clearly.’ On the other hand, when discussing negative characteristics regarding the delivery attribute in the VCA as a language partner, the students focused on interaction challenges. Related comments included ‘It can’t understand some of my speech,’ ‘It sometimes interrupts while you’re speaking,’ and ‘It can start a conversation even when you’re not interested.’ It is worth noting that positive comments about the delivery attribute were similar to those made by students who perceived the VCA as a complete human, while negative comments were similar to those identified by students who perceived the VCA as a complete artifact.

Furthermore, when it came to the availability attribute, the remarks made by students who saw the VCA as an in-between object were similar to those made by students who saw the VCA as an artifact. Five students, for example, noted the VCA’s great accessibility and convenience, which allows them to study anywhere and at any time. Four students mentioned that instead of studying English outside the classroom alone, they might do it with the VCA. ‘We can talk to the machine teacher to learn, even after school,’ S9 remarked. ‘Even my parents may use it to drive me to study English more at home,’ one student said, referring to its in-home usage as part of its high accessibility. On the other hand, some students thought the VCA should be linked to the internet, that it was fragile and not water-proof, and that it could quickly break down, all of which were highlighted as negative elements of the agent’s availability attribute as a language partner.

# 5.  Discussion

It is worth noting that 48 out of 67 participants $( 7 1 . 6 \% )$ evaluated the VCA as having human characteristics and perceived it as a human-like language partner, whether characterized as a complete human $\mathbf { \Psi } ( \mathbf { n } = 1 1 \mathbf { \Psi } )$ ) or something belonging to the residual category $\left( \mathrm { n } = 3 7 \right)$ . These students saw the agent as a conversational partner capable of L2 communication with accuracy, whereas the remaining 19 students $( 2 8 . 4 \% )$ who viewed the agent as a mere artifact regarded the VCA as a one-way instructional tool similar to an online dictionary. Overall, this research demonstrates VCAs’ great potential as language partners while providing important implications regarding how VCAs need to be developed in the future.

The findings indicate that, despite the absence of anthropomorphic embodiment, children tend to regard VCAs as possessing social properties, a finding in line with other studies that explored embodied agents (e.g., Ahmadi et  al., 2017; Sinatra et  al., 2021). That is, although it is exclusively through a voice that students interacted with the agent, students still perceived that the agent had social properties, particularly in terms of the delivery, rapport, and credibility attributes. The findings were consistent with recent studies that found modern computer voice could generate social perceptions in learners as effectively as the human voice and more effectively than low-quality computer voice (Chiou et  al., 2020; Craig & Schroeder, 2017; Davis et  al., 2019). In the current study, building inferences on the agent through listening, the majority of students placed great emphasis on the agent’s social characteristics. For instance, the students perceived the agent as having strong communication skills, such as the ability to ask and answer questions in L2 or to utter affective and engaging statements. They considered these cues as the agent’s advantage for being perceived as a human-like language partner.

The strong anthropomorphism tendency observed in this study, however, seems to partly contradict previous research that indicates that artificial agents with modern speech technology were not adequately perceived to be human-like or anthropomorphic. For example, research revealed a significant difference in the perception of human-likeness between human voice and modern computer voice, while no significant differences were found in perceptions of credibility and facilitated learning (Chiou et  al., 2020; Craig & Schroeder, 2017). In the same vein, research has also reported that, as learners gain enough knowledge about agents, they are less likely to anthropomorphize agents (Girouard‐Hallam et  al., 2021; Xu & Warschauer, 2020b). For example, Xu and Warschauer (2020b) found that, unlike students aged four to five, students as young as six did not anthropomorphize the VCA, although they still identified the agent’s social properties in terms of psychological, cognitive, and behavioral aspects. In this study, however, even with the participants’ relatively mature age for anthropomorphism, a greater proportion of the students $( 7 1 . 6 \% )$ anthropomorphized the VCA, which may indicate a greater potential for using VCAs as language partners not only for younger students but for students in later stages of elementary schooling, and presumably, even for adult learners.

The inconsistency might also be explained by the difference in context, specifically whether agents were used in an L1 or L2 setting and the role the agents played in such setting (Epley et  al., 2007). In contrast to previous research conducted in L1 environments (e.g., Girouard‐Hallam et  al., 2021; Xu & Warschauer, 2020a, 2020b), this study involved participants interacting with the agent as an agent L2 interlocutor. That is, when the students were trying to comprehend human-like characteristics in the agent, they may have used previous knowledge regarding L2 interlocutors, particularly about human language teachers (Rips, 1975). As the three-factor theory of anthropomorphism explains (Epley et  al., 2007), this EFL learning context may have increased students’ inclination to anthropomorphize the agent. Specifically, among the three factors (elicited agent knowledge, effectance, and sociality) used to predict the degree of anthropomorphism, it can be argued that the components of sociality and effectance promoted anthropomorphism in EFL students more strongly than these two factors would in L1 settings.

In terms of sociality, the EFL students in the current study did not have an extensive history of a social relationship with L2 interlocutors, despite their desire for it. For instance, some students expressed their desire to have acquaintances who were fluent in English and perceived that the agent could fulfill this need, as S4 stated, ‘I like the Google teacher because it would be good to have someone who is good at English around me.’ That is, when students were trying to comprehend human-like characteristics presented through the agent’s voice, the unique aspect of the EFL setting may have served as a facilitating condition for anthropomorphism toward the VCA (Epley et al., 2007). Next, regarding effectance, the different role that an agent performs with a student needs to be taken into consideration. Specifically, in the EFL context, interaction with an agent using English serves as both a means and end for language learning, in contrast to the role of interaction in L1 settings, where interaction with an agent primarily serves as a tool for acquiring specific subject knowledge (Bibauw et  al., 2019; Darvin & Norton, 2015). This means that the use of agents in the context of EFL learning provides stronger incentives for students to comprehend the agent, resulting in a stronger tendency for anthropomorphism, even in later stages of elementary schooling (Epley et  al., 2007).

Furthermore, the analysis of student comments regarding different attributions of language teacher properties to the VCA provides specific implications for how VCAs should be designed to be used as a conversational partner for language learning. First, among the agent’s programmed utterances, there were some techniques frequently referenced by students as noticeable human-like elements: reiteration of student responses and provision of affective feedback (Sinatra et  al., 2021; Xu & Warschauer, 2020b). While it is important to incorporate these types of programming into future VCA development, we also observed some technical limitations of the VCA that made students perceive it as a mere artifact: frequent misrecognition, unexpected pauses, and the inability to speak in L1. It is of note that perception of the VCA as an artifact was associated with a lack of interaction capabilities by the students. Therefore, for language learning, it is necessary to minimize these explicit limitations when developing VCAs; thus, eschewing students’ simplistic perceptions of VCAs solely as machines. These limitations should be examined by technology developers in close collaboration with language education experts (Jeon, 2022).

However, it should be highlighted that the technical solutions discussed above do not require VCAs to emulate human interlocutors fully. Instead, VCAs should be developed and made available as a new genre of language learning partner (Xu & Warschauer, 2020b). As demonstrated in the current study, unless VCAs are perceived solely as artifacts, they are perceived to provide similar interactional benefits to those of agents perceived as humans. Along with the interactional benefits, we observed that when the VCA was perceived as an in-between object, students identified additional benefits, particularly in terms of the availability attribute, including access convenience and ubiquitous usability, which were not as prominent for students who perceived the agent as a complete human. More importantly, in terms of the rapport attribute, students who perceived the VCA as an in-between object identified the same psychological properties in the VCA as students who perceived the VCA as a complete human, particularly properties such as feeling emotions or capability to build personal relationships.

Meanwhile, when the VCA was perceived to have mechanical components, students identified its frangibility, such as an inability to withstand water. This demonstrates the students’ misunderstanding of VCAs as merely a hardware device rather than a combination of hardware and software (Mertala, 2019). Given the increasing prevalence of smart devices in both home and school settings, ubiquity is a vital aspect of using VCAs for seamless and continuous language learning (Mertala, 2019). A thorough understanding of VCA software availability may facilitate students’ active incorporation of VCAs into their language learning. This may promote students’ perceptions of VCAs as artifacts; however, as this study shows, as long as VCAs are perceived as possessing a social nature and are supported by strong anthropomorphic factors in the EFL setting, they may still be perceived as useful language partners.

# 6.  Limitations

We recognize the limitations of our research, so caution is needed when interpreting the findings. First, the researchers examined only a small number of learners in the EFL classroom setting; therefore, future studies need to examine EFL learners from a diverse range of ages and cultural backgrounds for further theorizing and empirical examination regarding student perceptions of VCAs. Second, participants’ previous experience with VCAs could have affected their perceptions of the VCA as a language partner. It would be an interesting future area of study to investigate the impact of previous experience with VCAs and how the previous experience affects students’ perception of a VCA as a language partner and their justification. Third, most participants in this study interacted with the VCA regarding familiar topics that they could handle within their proficiency level. More difficult topics could lead to more communication breakdowns and might cause different perceptions. Last, this study exclusively employed a VCA that utilized audio mode in English only. Different types of conversational agents might result in different student perceptions. For example, researchers may want to explore agents with different modalities, such as agents embedded in a device with a visual screen (Hsu et  al., 2021; Tai & Chen, 2022) and agents with different language settings, such as those using both L1 and L2.

# 7.  Conclusion

This study examined how primary school students perceive VCAs as language partners while providing implications regarding how VCA technology should be developed and used for EFL learning. Specifically, through a drawing task and in-depth interview, we identified three themes regarding VCA perceptions: human, artifact, and residual. Students utilized their knowledge of language teachers and agents to explain their perceptions toward the VCA. Due to human-like social cues programmed into the agent and EFL environmental factors that helped to facilitate students’ anthropomorphism tendency, the majority of the participants did not consider the technology as a mere artifact. Furthermore, when students considered the VCA as an in-between object, they perceived it as creating a ubiquitous learning environment where the technology is always available and easy to access while still possessing human elements such as rapport attributes. In addition, recommendations for future development regarding specific elements of VCAs were presented thoroughly grounded in comments provided by the students.

The current study has important implications for the future direction of language learning that utilizes artificial agents. First, this study provides an important pedagogical justification for the use of VCAs in language learning, with a specific focus on VCAs embedded in smart devices. Some previous research has already shown the advantages of VCAs, including an increase in L2 motivation or willingness to communicate, as well as a decrease in speaking anxiety (e.g., Dizon, 2021; Jeon, 2022; Tai & Chen, 2020). Along with these studies, this research adds a new viewpoint on the benefits of employing VCAs by providing empirical evidence that VCAs can be perceived as conversational partners with their own distinct advantages, such as great accessibility and convenience. Second, this research contributes to our knowledge of how VCAs can be used in language learning. Unlike prior research that used existing conversational features available in commercial VCAs (e.g., Hsu et  al., 2021; Tai & Chen, 2022), this study employed a chatbot builder to create customized VCAs for the L2 classroom. Thus, this research shows another approach to employing VCAs and illustrates how to enhance the agent’s interaction and pedagogical use for language learning (Chen et  al., 2020). Third, using voice-controlled agents without embodiment components, this research demonstrates that modern computer voice could successfully facilitate social perceptions. That is, in addition to the embodied physical or on-screen agents introduced in the literature (e.g., Davis et  al., 2021; Kory-Westlund & Breazeal, 2019), instructors and researchers might be able to deploy VCAs equipped with modern computer voice to build social partnerships in the classroom. Finally, in contrast to earlier research on students’ perceptions toward voice-controlled agents, which were conducted in L1 contexts (e.g., Xu & Warschauer, 2020b), this study examined nine-year-old learners in an L2 environment, hence expanding the paths for agent perception research. Specifically, using the theory of anthropomorphism, this research explained why L2 learners had a considerable tendency toward anthropomorphic perceptions of the VCA. Thus, this study may serve as an initial guide for further research into the use of VCAs as conversational partners for L2 learners.
