In Essential Knowledge and kill for Essay Writing, Neil Bowen has written a comprehensive and aesible textbook that deserves to be read..I'm just not sure by whom. As somebody who has strugged to teach essay writing toundergraduates for years, I found the book to befu of ids n practcl ctities to use in the clroo. wer, theubtitl ofthe book is Prcticl Gide for L and EFL Undergraduates, and I'm just not sure who would benefit most from this book.

The book takes an integrated approach to essay writing, focusing on both the proceses behind writing and the products The content and layout are based on four tenets: rhetorical knowledge, subject knowledge, process knowledge, and formal knowledge. Each unit begins with a product approach, which defines and introduces the structures and features of various model texts. Then the unit switches to a more pragmatic approach where the students are introduced to the basic elements of writing each gere. After these exercises, which reinforce the formal and rhetorical knowledge of the genre, the unit then moves on to examine subject and process knowledge. Students work on generating ideas and planning/outining, before finally developing their essays. There ar five units and the book begins with a general chapter loking at essay writing basics, before moving onto examine more traditional types of writing: descriptive, narrative, expository, and argument/opinion.

As noted in the introduction of the book, the overallapproach the author takes is proces-genre and the structure of the book mirrors Badger and White's earlier model (Badger & White, 2000, p. 159) in which learners are irt inroduced to the generic conventions of the writing, before then moving on to the more process-oriented: planning, drafting, and writing. The advantage of ths integrated approach is that the negative asects of roces, es emphasis on inguistic knowlege and gene, and les emphasis on the skills needed to produce atext, are counter-balanced by each approach's positives. Process-genre develops the writers' knowledge about language, context, purpose, and writing development.

The proces-genre approach in academic writing is a popular area of research as evidenced by a search on Google Scholar, which finds around 1.5 million articles based on this topic. It i also the approach that I personally take when teaching academic writing, soI am confirming my own bias. However, despite this, what sets this book apart is how clearly it goes through the various stages of the process-genre approach without an overl theoretical explanation of the processes involved. This makes the book more acessible to learners, as they are not burdened by theory, and to esearchers/practitioners as they can see practicalapproach to how theory i put into practice.

In the introduction to the book, the author writes that a textbook focusing on this composite approach to teaching writing has been "conspicuously absent" but thi is difficult for me to comment on as in many ways it seems quite traditional and, as I mentioned it confirms my own ideas of writing pedagogy. However, as Matsuda has writen \*thetas for the teacher. is tofind ways to integrate insights from various areas of research in ways that respond to the local context of teaching" (Racelis & Matsuda, 2013, p. 390). This Bowen has done successfuly, and the ideas and activities presented deserve a wider audience than just their specific context.

Indeed, research by Huang and Jun Zhang (2020, p. 357) has shown the positive effcts of a proces-genre approach on students argumentative writing in an EFL context and based on this research they suggest three pedagogical implications of the approach:

1. Scaffolding students writing knowledge and skills, balancing emphasis on genre knowledge and writing processes. 2. Using model texts not only highlights ingustic features but also focuses on topic-specific content knowledge and rhetorical structures. 3. Writing is a collaborative process (through group analyzing, outlining, drafin, and peer-reviewing, interaction is encouraged)

This textbook embodies this pedagogical approach, even providing suggestions for collaborative pr review. In fact the model texts are taken from the author's teaching experience in Thailand and, as someone who teaches in an EFL environment,I found these were particularly instructive. This was both from the perspective of providing me with activities I could use and adapt in my own classroms and also for the fc it emphasizes that English is not just a tol ofthe Anglo-Westen world and is used globally by a variety of learners with diffring backgrounds and proficiencies. However, whilst acknowledging the potential efficacy of the teaching approach in an EFL environment, it is worth noting that the book is designed to be a practical guide for both EFL and ESL undergraduates, and whether one book or approach is suitable for both contexts is open to debate.

Also, of note, especially for a textbook, is simply that I enjoyed reading this ok ts an easy read, clearly structured and wrtten in a style that engages and keeps your interest. Many academic writing textbooks are very dry, and whilst nobody is expecting a riveting page-turner that can't be put down, the enthusiasm of the author and the richness of his use of language keep you reading and enjoying this book. For example, on p. 256 the author describes a thesis statement as "an anchor, and your argument as the boat attached to it. Without an anchor, the boat wil drift ff into the ocan and be lost forever. This s far from the usual decritio of a thes statement and the book is full of figurative language that maintains your interest and makes you think.

As an academic writing teacher, I have mainly focused on the teaching of expository and argumentative writing, so the units on descriptive and narrative writing were particularly interesting and instructive for me. By using this textbook, I fel that I could now teach leons about these writing styles, and it has also given me new insights into the teaching of genres that I am more familiar with. For example, in the unit on argument/opinion writing there i a clear and comprehensive description of the Toulmin method and how it can be usd to wite a argment essay. Over the years  hae unuccessul batted wth myself and my students rying to teach his, and now, after reading the book, I can see how I might introduce and use it.

As I have written so far about my enjoyment of the book as an academic writing instructor, I go back to my previous point as to who would most benefit from the book I am just not sure that it is practical guide for undergraduates in an ESL or EFL environment. As I mentioned earlier, I enjoyed the rich use of language in the book but would my students? I can actually envisage them checking the meaning of 'anchor' in a dictionary and what was enjoyable for me, might be confusing for them.

However, the bigest ssue for me has nothing to do with the writing, but the formatting. It's alittle book that crams in a lot of information, and I think i should be a big book (i.., textbook-sized). This miht sm trivial but f I wanted to use the activities in the classoom  would need  magnfying glas. For example, on p. 79 one of the xercises i to describe a picture, which i literall the size f a postage stamp. Thisis abig book in terms f the ides and content, but the formattin i too small and, I think, it would be better in the form of a larger textbook.

Before finishing this review, I would like to briefly turn to an issue not just necessarily for this academic writing textbook, but potentiall for al future ones. In the December isue of the Jounal of Second Language Writig, there is a discussion of the use of generative AI such as Chat GPT and is relationship with academic writing pedagogy. For most of us, this is now a big ssue, and we are struggling to deal with what is rapidly developing phenomenon that is aready influencing the production of our students' writing. Warschauer et al. (2023) argue for the benefits of using Al and propose a pedagogical framework that encourages digital literacy, whereas Kubota (2023) is more cautious about its use and advocates a more measured approach, concerned that it could diminish students abilit o writ. Theri  debat about th use of gnerative l but what i clear is whichever position we take, the tacher in the classroom needs guidance on what to do, and this i usuall provided by the textbook they use in class. Does this now mean that all new academic writing textbooks should, to some extent, deal with this ssue? Both Warschauer and Kubota emphasize the importance of Al literacy and it does sm likely that the pedagogical materials we wil use in the classrom must take this into account. lthough this book doesn't make reference to thes issues, as you might expect with such a recent issue, it might be the case in future that textbook writers have to recognize the implications of generative AI.

In summary, although I enjoyed reading this book, I dont think this is such a practical guide for students, but for educators who want to use the ideas in the classroom, it is a practical and useful reference.
