# Community of Practice Design Guide

A Step-by-Step Guide for Designing & Cultivating Communities of Practice in Higher Education

# Acknowledgments

This guide was developed based on the shared experiences of several organizations working together in ways that embody the spirit of collaboration. These included the National Learning Infrastructure Initiative at EDUCAUSE (http://www.educause.edu/nlii) and a community it sponsored, the Bridging VCOP; the American Association for Higher Education. (http://www.aahe.org); and iCohere (http://www.icohere.com). We would also like to specifically acknowledge the NLII VCOP Facilitators Team and four generations of NLII Fellows for their ongoing contribution to and successful demonstration of many of the processes and tools presented in this guide.

# How to Use This Community Design Guide

This guide provides a practical approach to creating communities of practice (CoPs) based on experiences working with corporations, nonprofits, associations, government organizations, and educational institutions. While it is important to recognize that every organization and community is different, this guide provides a structure to help clarify the most important design elements that go into defining, designing, launching, and growing CoPs—both online and face-to-face. The first three pages of the guide are designed for those who are considering the strategic use of CoPs to facilitate collaboration, learning, or knowledge generation and want to know more. The subsequent pages of the guide are designed to help CoP designers and facilitators understand the questions, issues, and options involved in planning and cultivating communities.

# What Is a Community of Practice?

A community of practice is a group of people who share a common concern, a set of problems, or interest in a topic and who come together to fulfil both individual and group goals.1 CoPs often focus on sharing best practices and creating new knowledge to advance a domain of professional practice. Interaction on an ongoing basis is an important part of this. A community’s specific purpose and goals inform the appropriate activities and technologies that should support it. Many virtual communities of practice rely on face-to-face meetings as well as Web-based collaborative environments to communicate, connect, and conduct community activities.

# Why Are Communities Important?

Today, organizations, workgroups, teams, and individuals must work together in new ways. Interorganizational collaboration is increasingly important. Communities of practice provide a new model for connecting people in the spirit of learning, knowledge sharing, and collaboration as well as individual, group, and organizational development.

Communities of practice are important because they:

Connect people who might not otherwise have the opportunity to interact, either as   
frequently or at all.   
Provide a shared context for people to   
communicate and share information, stories, and personal experiences in a way that builds understanding and insight.   
Enable dialogue between people who come together to explore new possibilities, solve challenging problems, and create new,   
mutually beneficial opportunities.   
Stimulate learning by serving as a vehicle for authentic communication, mentoring,   
coaching, and self-reflection.   
Capture and diffuse existing knowledge to help people improve their practice by   
providing a forum to identify solutions to   
common problems and a process to collect and evaluate best practices.   
Introduce collaborative processes to   
groups and organizations as well as between organizations to encourage the free flow of ideas and exchange of information.   
Help people organize around purposeful   
actions that deliver tangible results.   
Generate new knowledge to help people transform their practice to accommodate   
changes in needs and technologies.

# How Do You Build CoPs?

Communities of practice are dynamic social structures that require “cultivation” so that they can emerge and grow. 2 Organizations can sponsor CoPs, and through a series of steps, individuals can design a community environment, foster the formalization of the community, and plan activities to help grow and sustain the community. But ultimately, the members of the community will define and sustain it over time.

# How Do Communities Grow?

Communities have lifecycles—they emerge, they grow, and they have life spans. For each lifecycle phase, specific design, facilitation, and support strategies exist that help achieve the goals of the community and lead it into its next stage of development. If the community is successful, over time the energy, commitment to, and visibility of the community will grow until the community becomes institutionalized as a core value-added capability of the sponsoring organization. The following model3 outlines the lifecycle phases of communities.

![](img/a6d502da281f161a24cdd38ba17c9df552c7eb9c215e3cf4bc0a1cbcaa678a41.jpg)  
(adapted from McDermott, 2002)

The lifecycle phases include:

Inquire: Through a process of exploration and inquiry, identify the audience, purpose, goals, and vision for the community.   
Design: Define the activities, technologies, group processes, and roles that will support the community’s goals.   
Prototype: Pilot the community with a select group of key stakeholders to gain commitment, test assumptions, refine the strategy, and establish a success story.   
Launch: Roll out the community to a broader audience over a period of time in ways that engage newcomers and deliver immediate benefits.   
Grow: Engage members in collaborative learning and knowledge sharing activities, group projects, and networking events that meet individual, group, and organizational goals while creating an increasing cycle of participation and contribution.   
Sustain: Cultivate and assess the knowledge and “products” created by the community to inform new strategies, goals, activities, roles, technologies, and business models for the future.

Successfully facilitating a CoP involves understanding these lifecycle phases and ensuring that the expectations, plans, communications, collaborative activities, technologies, and measures of success map to the current phase of the community’s development. Without conscious facilitation, momentum may be lost during the launch phase and the CoP may not achieve the critical mass needed to evolve into a sustainable entity.

# How Do Online Communities Become Places?

Facilitating community is not a static, one-time event related to “turning on” a software platform or technology. While technology—the technical architecture—can assist greatly in providing a platform for communication and collaboration, even more important is the social architecture of the community. The technical architecture supports the community, while the social architecture enlivens it. The roles, processes, and approaches that engage people— whether face-to-face or online—are essential in relationship building, collaborative learning, knowledge sharing, and action. Together, technical and social architectures create the container for the community.

An effective approach to community facilitation involves creating a predictable “rhythm” that sets an expectation around how and when to participate in the community. A “sense of place” is created in the minds of community members through an integrated, thoughtful combination of face-to-face meetings, live online events, and collaboration over time within a persistent Web environment.

# Purpose Is Paramount

While almost every community evolves along a lifecycle, every community is indeed unique, with distinct goals, member characteristics and needs, and purpose. All design choices (for technical or social architecture) must be driven by purpose, so community purpose is paramount. Successful and sustainable communities have focused, well-defined purposes that are directly tied to the sponsoring organization’s mission. Purposes should be defined in terms of the benefits to the community’s stakeholders and the specific needs that the community will be organized to meet. Purposes can be categorized into the following four areas of activity:

# Culture of Inquiry and Evidence and Community Activities

Once purpose has been defined, the next important planning activity is to frame the assessment infrastructure and the language of inquiry and evidence that the community and its stakeholders will use to understand and document success in achieving the purpose, meeting organization goals, responding to needs, and making decisions about future actions. Rubrics for assessment of the effectiveness of community activities have not yet been fully developed; however, the following are general questions to explore in assessing the quality of

The next two sections outline specific issues related to defining the appropriate “social and technical architectures” for a given community. By providing questions that need to be answered at the beginning of each lifecycle stage, community facilitators can apply best practices in community development to their own CoPs. In addition to these key questions, a number of prescriptive activities are described that lead to specific work products. These include documents and presentations that can be used for communication, planning, and the facilitation of the community itself.

# Emphasizing the Right Technical Features

The following table summarizes the core technical features found across the four primary areas of activity of most CoPs. Most communities possess a mix of these features as a way to support an integrated approach to relationship building, learning, knowledge sharing, and actionable projects. Consider the table below as a menu. Identify the appropriate combination of features to support your own community’s specific goals. In addition, also consider how certain features may be “core” at one phase of your community’s lifecycle and how other features may be introduced as your community evolves. For example, in the Prototype and Grow phases, relationship building and learning may be core, while in the Sustain phase, knowledge sharing and project management may become more central.
