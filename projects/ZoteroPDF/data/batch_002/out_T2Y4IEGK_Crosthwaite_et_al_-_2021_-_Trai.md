Disciplinary writing

Despite a marked shift towards blended learning in EAP due to massification of higher education and the impact of CoviD-19, relatively little is known about student engagement with EAP genre education as realised through blended learning. This paper explores international undergraduate/ graduate students' perceptions of using an online text, image and video annotation tool (CIRRUS) during a blended academic writing course, as they annotate genre exemplar texts for key functional and rhetorical language features both in-class and individually online. Genres covered include essays and critiques within the Arts and Humanities, case studies and problem questions within the Social Sciences, explanations and methodology recounts within the Life Sciences, and design specifications and exercises within the Physical Sciences following Gardner and Nesi's (2013) genre families taxonomy. We explore students' end-of-course reflections of the value of annotating genre features for understanding disciplinary academic writing practices under a blended approach, the affordances of annotating disciplinary exemplar texts using the CIRRUS annotation platform, and any remaining challenges for future iterations. Using both questionnaire $( \mathtt { n } = 6 2 )$ ) and interview ${ \bf ( n = 1 0 ) }$ methods, the results suggest students appreciated the value of annotating exemplar texts for genre features, while annotating in CIRRUS was advantageous over previous practice in improving students' understanding of text structure, organisation, generation of ideas, and knowledge of genre/disciplinary rhetorical features.

# 1. Introduction

While many universities are moving towards blended learning pedagogies in the age of massification of higher education (now purred on b covD-19-induced social distancing), there i relatively lttle rearch about students engagment wth gre ducation in EAP under a blended learning aproach (Tuomainen, 2016). Blended learning is dfferntiated from face-to-face on-campus learning and distance (online-only) learning in that it combines the best seting of both worlds, both online and face-to-face (Maulan & Ibrahim, 2012 p. 561), offering multiple pathways to leaner-content, learner-learner and learner-instruction interaction. Proponents of blended learning claim advantages for student engagement, motivation, interaction and - eventuall - improved academic performance (Kuzmina & Golechkova, 2012; Pereria et al., 2007). However, research has also revealed certain challenges for its plementation, despite initial favourable student perceptions (e.g. Wang et al., 2019).

Common pedagogical approaches to genre education in EAP range from text annotation following move-step analysis (e.g. Swales 1990); ethnographic exploration of the social purpose of texts (ie the New Rhetric approach, Bazerman, 198); explicit teaching of interactive/interpersonal metadiscourse (e.g. Jiang & Hyland, 2017), alongside systemic functional approaches (e.g. Martin & Rose, 2008). Yet, despite the aforementioned increase in EAP programs operating under blended learning, and despite more studies investigating blended EAP in general (e.g. Barret & Liu, 2019; Harker & Koutsantoni, 2005), we have ittlecrrent nformation on how genre education is conducted under blended learning conditions, or students' perceptions regarding the processes and outcomes of such instruction. Such research is important given that traditional pedagogical approaches to genre education may be reshaped and/or constrained by the move to ablended environment. From a socio-cultural perspective, students individual and collaborative modes of learning are strongly mediated through the selection and use of language artefact, tass and (online) toos (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Vygotsky, 1978), in this case as students develop EAP genre knowledge in preparation for later disciplinary studies. Understanding how blended leaning impacts the provision of EAP genre education as students interact among themselves, their teachers, the target genres, and the online environment, is therefore increasingly important.

The context for the present study is that of a for-credit semester-long introductory academic writing/study skils programme offered at undergraduate and graduate levels of study at aleading university in Australia. As part of an overhaul of EAP provision for in. ternational students from a previous textbook-led, teacher-centred currculum, all in-clas content was completely re-written and transferred to a blended learning plaform (EDx, www.edx.org). Completion of the online component includes over 200 multiple choice questions, videos, drag-and-drop tasks, per discussion questions, long-form discussion forums and genre annotation activities worth a total $^ { 1 5 \% }$ of the final grade for the course, and a required assessment hurdle of greater than $7 0 \%$ completion.

A key component of this blended course is a two-week module on rhetorical and structural genre features, where students anotate exemplar texts for these features across eight genres and thirteen subdisciplines spanning soft/hard disciplinary categories using a purpose-bult text, mage and video annotation platorm - iRRs. This paper determines students overall reaction to the annotation process students' perceptions of the value of recognising and understanding isciplinary genre features via the annotation proces; whether the blended annotation method was potentially advantageous over student's prior experiences; and any challenges or recommendations arising for further inovation in blended genre education. The overarching research questions are stated as follows.

RQ1: What are the perceptions of international students of English for Academic Purposes regarding the process and product of using an online annotation platform to annotate exemplar texts for disciplinary genre and language features?

RQ2: What do students consider as the affordances and/or downsides of a blended-specific approach to annotating exemplar texts for genre features?

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Genre education in EAP

Genre education involves discovering, analysing, learning, and (in many cases) reproducing through writing or speaking the lexicogrammatical features, moves, and hetorical contexts of target geres within repreentative exmplar texts, with gere deined in this paper as aclas of communicative events" that share commonalities in function, structure and rhetorical devices (Palridge, 2014, p. 303). This paper focuses on genre education as usually applied in tertiary contexts where English is the medium of intruction and Where the students involved are L2 speakers of English, and where the goal i to prepare students for acquiring disciplinary discourses either during or fllowing freshman English for General Academic Purposes courses (e.g. Hyland, 2017). The goal of L2 genre edu. cation is to develop knowledge of genre- and discipline-specific writing conventions, rhetorical features, meta-knowledge, and lin guistic knowledge (Kobayashi & Rinnert, 2012).

Interestingly, while \*genre" as a focus of EAP research has increased significantly between 1980 and 2020, and while Swales (1990) Genre Analysis remains the second most influential work in EAP between 2000 and 2020, both \*approach to teaching" and "teaching practice are terms that have significantly decreased in the EAP literature during the same period, acording to a recent bibliometric analysis of the field (Hyland & Jiang, 2020). Hyland and Jiang maintain that research interest in teaching practice has remained "consistent", although the focus has switched to \*the context, discourses, and implications of these practices" (p.9) rather than innovation in the actual pedagogical methods adopted.

Genre education at Australian universities typicall follows Systemic Function Linguistics-based approaches or Swalesian move. step approaches (Yayli, 2011). Typical classroom pedagogy under either approach involves (to some degree at least) the close reading of exemplar texs that have ither already ben annotated for key structural and rhetorical features representative of the target genre, or that are to be annotated for such features by students. This process has been laelled "most inriguing, challenging and beneficial activity for them" when acquiring genre knowledge (Yayli, 2011, p. 126). However, most research involving anotation of genre features has been conducte primarily offline. Even some very recent studies stil conduct annotation of genre moves or rhetorical fatures using highlighter pen on paper (Tann & Scott, 2021), whil others have explored the offine use of highlight, underline and comment functions in word processors (e.g. Cai, 2016), the copy/pasting of excerpts from exemplar prior to colouring, italicizing, and boldfacing (e.g. Cheng, 2015), or do not actually mention the annotation mode at all(e.g. Yayli, 2011).

This is unfortunate because the focus-on-form provided by the annotation activity combined with the collaborative advantages afforded by blended learning are potentially very important for genre education, given that students' discussion around rhetorical structure and language features can result in improved genre metalanguage and ability to critique their own and others' writing (Tardy, 2009). Further exploration of the afordances of annotating for genre features in online spaces is therefore warranted

# 2.2. Blended genre pedagogies in EAP

A range of studies over the last decade have explored EAP provision through blended learning. However, the issue of how blended this provision actually is varies acording to the relative proportion of interaction that takes place across ffline and online spaces. Some studies claiming to investigate blended learning were taught mainly offline with the blended component simply comprised of course materials uploaded to a learning management system (e.g. Moodle or Blackboard), with little meaningful interaction in the online space (e.g. Asoodar et al., 2014; Pavanelli, 2018). Other studies aded extra online content in the form of academic vocabulary/grammar drills and quizzes,although these remain an addendum to the main in-clss offline provision (Abbas, 2018). Studies involving truly blended learning, where the in-classcontent is also hosted and completed online alongside other activities completed online in the students' own time, are comparatively rare. Notable exceptions include Tuomainen (2016) where eight of eleven weeks provision was wholly online, where students completed tasks, watched videos and interacted in online discussion via Moodle, with favourable student perceptions; Harker and Koutsantoni (2005) whose blended EAP platorm included a personal notebook, self-asesments and an online chat forum; and Barret and Liu (2019) whose platform used Google Plus/Slides for hosting in-class course content and videos, with synchronous chat through the Line mobile application.

Corpora annotated for genre features have also featured in recent studies, primarily involving texts pre-tagged following a Swa lesian move/ste model (e.g. Upton, 2002) or slf-compiled corpora of the target genre (.g. Lee & Swales, 2006). Early studies lacked information on how thisdata was presented tostudents, alongside reported dfficulties in the proces of annotating move-step features in such corpora using software available at the time (Flowerdew, 2005). Recent studies involving a blended data-driven learning approach have used pre-annotated move-step exemplars whil attempting to match students' reporting of comparable moves in their own drafts (Cotos et al., 2017), or have combined move-step annotations with disciplinary vocabulary lists (Chang & Kuo, 2011) However, such studies are stll rare due to a lack of available software, teachers trained in dat-driven learning pedagogies, and availability of corpora annotated for genre features (Lu et al., 2021).

Interestingly, while studies of blended learning for EAP are increasing, a much smallr number have explicitly investigated genre education in blended or even fuly online modes. recent example is Dugartsyrenova (2019), where an academic writing tutor offered instruction online regarding the move-steps of research proposals acros a range of discilinary areas. The online system used included input materials, online tests, online feedback (showing $\%$ accuracy of move-steps) and tracking of individual student activity. Almost all students reported preferring the online system to equivalent offline modes, whil students' online participation was linked to improvements in move-step annotation acuracy, despite indicating ssues with the onine feedback system and feelig overwhelmed with the number of online activitie. Another recent example (Viser and Sukavatee (2020), combined offline/online collaborative writing activities acros procedural, decriptie, narrative, and persuasive genre, rsultig in improved writing abilit and positive student perceptions. The aforementioned Cotos et al. (2017) study introduces the Research Writing Tutor, where annotated move-step corpora, instructional videos and automatedfeedack are combined to full blend the process of genre analysi across multiple levels of engagement.

However, more studies of genre education as realised through blended learning are recommended if pedagogical inovation inthis space i to ke up with the technologie now availble In particular, student perctions of the value of annotating exemplar texts for genre features in a blended mode are important, in that if modern, digially-orinted students fail to seethe purpose in this exercise, they may fail tobe invested in leaning more about genre, and potentially be les invested in academic writing more generally (Tardy, 2009).

# 3. Method

# 3.1. Research context

This study explores the annotation of genre and rhetorical features using a purpose-built text, image and video annotation platform - CIRRUs' - within two (undergraduate/graduate) fr-credit blended academic writing courses at a university in Australia. The courses are blended' in that ll module content and activities are hosted on a commercial online learning platform (www.edx.org), while inclass face-to-face tutorials (as wellas online tutorials via Zoom, due to covi-19) are taught live by a tutor and involve small-group and whole-class activities hosted on the same platorm. Students take weekly modules on content including recognising academic stance and voice, citation and referencing practice, critical thinking, organising arguments and paragraphs, academic integrit, use of corpora as a reference resource, interactional and interpersonal metadiscourse, and editing and proofreading. The online course materials are worth a total $1 5 \%$ of the course grade (for between 90 and $1 0 0 \%$ completion), with completion tracked online in EDx. Course assessment includes acomparative article review assignment where students compare structural and rhetorical features across two paper from their discipline and one from another discipline, and an 'open' final asessment where students produce a written assignment in a genre of their own choice (according to their disciline), whilerflecting on how course content provided the requisite knowledge to produce this writing.

# 3.2. Procedure: blended component

The present study focuses on a two-week online double module, critical to both course asssments, involving the annotation of key genre features across hard/soft disciplines -namely Arts and Humanities, Social Sciences, Physical Sciences and Life Sciences. Gnre text exemplars within these four main disciplinary categories were sourced from the British Academic Written English corpus (BAWE, Alsop & Nesi, 2009).? The selection of genres as representative of these disciplinary categories were sourced from an appendix in Gardner and Nesi (2013), which shows the most frequent genres employed within each disciplinary category. In most cases, two exemplar texts were selected for each genre, with one exemplar each taken from one subdiscipline within the main disciplinary category, although in some cases (i.e. case study, problem question, exercise) one exemplar was considered suficient. Selected exemplar texts of each genre were controlled for level using BAwE criteria (only Levels 1 and 2, representing taught undergraduate level) and the first author hand-picked exemplars that clearly represented their labelled genre, were generally readable for L2 English speakers of approximately IELTs 6-7 band scores, and where explicit signposting of genre or rhetorical features could clearly be identified for later annotation. Following the first semester's instructio in 2018,all exemplar texts were shortened to only contain paragraphs emphasising the target genre/rhetorical feature for annotation, with other elements redacted given students complaints that the texts took to long to read during class The genres and subdisciplines explored in these modules are described in Table 1:

Given the two-week timeframe for covering eight genres acros thirten subdisciplines, introducing a detailed Swalesian move-step approach to the annotation of genre features within each exemplar was not feasible. Rather, our approachis similar to Devit et al.'s (2004) guidlines for analysing genres", involving the collction of exemplar texs in this case, from the BAwE), studying the sitatin of the text provided to the students via a brief description, identifying and describing pattens in the genre's features, and analysing what these pattrns reveal - with the annotation proces dealing with the latter two. In practice, this involved students skim reading each text for 5 min, then labelling sections f the text according to thre-four guiing questions intended to draw students attention to particular structural or rhetorical features deemed as representative of the target genre by the researchers. For example, when annotating the critique from the linguistics subdiscipline, students were asked to annotate the following:

A) How and where does the writer outline what the writer is going to critique, and how they are going to do it?   
B) How, and where does the writer analyse the data?   
C) How, and where does the writer interpret the data critically?   
D) How and where does the writer describe the limitations of their critique?

Students were asked to add the relevant letter A-D above to their annotations, and provide more detail as to their reasoning within the annotation text. Fig. 1 highlights for the reader the annotations from all students on the aforementioned linguisics exemplar, as well as the tex from some individual sample student annotations. The numbers shown correspond to the start point of an individual annotation, with each number representing one annotation per student. Individual numbers are clickable and show the individual student's annotation in full (student's names have been omitted from the image). These are also viewable by other students as they annotate live.

Upon completion of the annotation activity, students are directed to an image of the text as annotated by the researchers in MS Word, which could be interpreted as the model' answer (Fig. 2). However, students were informed in each case that \*there may be more examples in the text that we have not highlighted, so do not worry if your answer does not match ours $1 0 0 \% ^ { * }$

Half of the exemplar texts were annotated in-class in groups of four-five students under the supervision of a tutor in real-time, in order to promote scafflded, collaborative interaction among peers as they divided up the task of annotating the four guided questions or worked in pairs on the same guiding question. The other half were annotated individually in the students' own time, although students could see others' prior annotations as an alternative form of scaffolding afforded by the platform.

The final module activity was a reflective online discussion forum task where students commented on their understanding of the word genre', discussed the importance of learning about genres outside of the essay and outside of their discipline, and how the knowledge gained fromthis proces might change their academic writing practice. This reflection is important given the ability to elf reflect "is not separate from the process of coming to know and understand' (Granville & Dison, 2005, p. 99).

# 3.3. Questionnaire survey

A link to the survey used in this study was sent to allstudents who had taken the undergraduate or graduate versions of the ac. ademic writing course over the previous four semesters' instruction (approximately 400 students). The survey was hosted and completed online using Google Forms. The survey was presented i three parts, with Part 1 addressing students prior knowledge and experience of genre education, Part addressing the proces of annotating genre features in CIRRUs, and Part 3 addressing students perceptions of the usefulness of annotating genre features in general and in CIrRus in particular. All questions followed a 5-point Likert scale (Strongly Agree $= 5$ , Agree $= 4$ , Neutral $= 3$ , Disagree $= 2$ , Strongly disagree $\ l = 1 \AA$ ). The questionnaire items are included as a supplemental online file.

In total, 62 students responded to the survey. Of these, 30 had taken the undergraduate version of the course with 32 taking the

graduate version. Of the undergraduates, ten respondents were from s.E. Asia and 20 from E. Asia, and with four male respondents compared with 26 females. Ten undergraduates reported as being Health and Behavioural Science (HABS) psychology majors, with 19 Humanities and Social Sciences (HAss) students from the schoos of Communication and Arts or Languages and Cultures, and with one respondent only from the Faculty of Science. Of the graduate students, three respondents were from S.E. Asia, 26 from E. Asia,two from S. Asia and one from S. America, whil seven respondents were male compared with 25 females. All graduate students were HASS students, except one from the Faculty of Science. Cronbach's Alpha for Part 1 of the survey was 0.903, Part 2 was 0.837, and Part 3 was 0.933, each value indicative of a high degree of internal reliability across each individual section of the survey, while the Alpha value across the survey as a whole was 0.908.

For the statistical analysis of the survey data, we used conditional inference tres (CITs (Tagliamonte & Baayen, 2012). Like other multivariate tree-based methods, ITs recursively split the data into two parts to maximize the prediction accuracy, representing a flexible multivariate method that provides outputs that are readily interpretable (Baayen et al., 2013). In contrast to traditional

Unlike the essay, the writer spends a lot of time in the introduction outlining, describing and justifying the theoretical I analytical frameworks they will use for their critique. Generall, critiques at university are not just the subjective opinion of the author. Rather, critiques at university tend to follow an established theoretical / analytical framework taken from the literature.

classification and regression trees (CARTs), CITs use significance tests to determine if agiven split i justified (Grie, 2020). Ths procedure also reduces the need for pruning (Hothorn et al., 2006) whil variables with more potential spliting points are not artificially preferred (Boulesteix et al., 2015). In our study, we thus use CITs to find relationships between the predictors and the dependent variable(s).

# 3.4. Interviews

Interview data consisted of nine open questions exploring students' perceptions of genre knowledge, the usefulness and value of annotating exemplary texts for genre features using the CIRRUS annotation too, as wel as to what extent any increased knowledge of genre features was considered beneficial for future studies. As many students consented to complete the questionnaire but not the interviews due to concens over CoviD-19,the poolof participants was limited to mostly graduate students from theapplied linguistics discipline, the most populous group. Based on these students questionnaire response filtered according to their relative preference for/against annotating in CIRRUs), ten participants were invited to interview with the second author online via Zoom in a COvID-safe

environment. Table 2 describes these participants.

The interviews lasted on average $1 5 { - } 2 0 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ and were audio recorded. They followed a semi-structured sequence of questions chosen by the researcher beforehand while retaning the interviewee's fedom to laborate and express their opinions on issues raied (Marshall & Rossman, 2010. In this manner, the interviewee has the freedom to go in unpredictable directions on topics, allowing the researcher further insight into the issues discussed.

The interviews were transcribed and analysed into segments of meaning, with short phrases coded manually using in-vivo coding using procedures suggested in the Coding Manual for Qualitative Researchers (Saldana, 2016). In-vivo coding uses the terms and concepts emerging from the participants' words; thus, it is possibleto capture their experiences and perceptions while preserving the meaning of their views and actions in the coding itself (Charmanz, 2014). Following the in-vivo coding, a broader categorization of concepts that express similar meaning were determined as emerging from the codes. These categories were grouped into themes, which merge the categories, codes and excerpts into one idea that can be explained and analysed. According to DeSantis and Ugarriza (2000, p. 362) A theme is an abstract entity that brings meaning and identity to a recurrent experience and its variant manifestations. As such, a theme captures and unifies the nature or basis of the experience into a meaningful whole'. In this sense, the extracted themes represent broader concepts that unify participants answers. Finally, the themes, categories and code frequencies are visualised via mind maps to better understand the lins between the perceptions and experiences of the interviewed participants regarding the process and outcomes and annotating for genre features in CIRRUS.

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Survey responses

Part 1 of the survey explored participants prior understanding of the types and roles of genres within disciplinary discourses and any relevant previous genre instruction (Fig. 3).

Overall survey respondents provided a mixed picture regarding whether their prior knowledge and experience of genre education had resulted in an appreciation for the importance of genre within academic writing in general and for disciplinary discourses in particular. Despite most students claiming knowledge of the importance of genre and language for disciplinary writing, few students reported knowledge of the specific genres common to their discipline nor knowledge of disciplinary variation of language features, While only approximately half of respondents reported they had received genre-based instruction prior to enrolling on the course. Importantly, only $3 2 \%$ of students reported previously annotating texts for genre or language features. Regarding the CIT results for Part 1 of the survey, the only significant difference was found in responses for Q3 (knowledge of disciplinary genres), with students from E. Asia $( \mathtt { n } = 4 6$ responses) reporting as less likely than those from S.E. Asia $( \mathbf { n } = 1 6 )$ to have such knowledge $\left( \mathtt { p } = . 0 2 6 \right)$

Part 2 of the survey explored students responses regarding the process of annotation for genre and language features in CIRRUS Fig. 4).

Students' overall reaction to annotating genre and language features in CIRRUs appears positive in terms of understanding th purpose of annotating, understanding the instructions and guiding questions for annotation, and the accuracy of students annotations when compared to the teacher-annotated model exemplars They were also positive the CIRRUs annotation proces had increased their interest in genre education for future studies. Most students reported littledifficulty in annotating target features using the CIRRUS platorm, and were comfortable with the difficulty of the exemplars provided. Students were largely positie that annotating in CIRRUS would be preferable to annotating using pen and paper, although it is interesting that $4 4 \%$ remained undecided. Students provided mixed responses as to whether they engaged with peers annotations, and most students reported not needing to return to the annotations they or others had made once the activities were complete.

Fig. 5. Students' post-course perceptions of the usefulness of annotating in CIRRUS.

Regarding the CIT results for Part 2 of the survey, significant differences in response dependent on students' origin were found for Q01 (understanding purpose of annotation') in favour of students from S.E. Asia, $\mathbf { ( p = . 0 3 6 ) }$ as well as Q02 (\*instructions for annotation were clear') again in favour of students from S.E. Asia $( \mathtt { p } = . 0 1 0 )$ . Interestingly, gender was seen to a be significant factor for Q10 ("annotating in CIRRUS vs. annotation on paper), with males $( \mathtt { n } = 1 1$ ) found to be more favourable $\left( \mathbf { p } = . 0 2 \right)$ to annotating in CIRRUS than females $\mathbf { ( n = 5 1 } )$ , although the reason for this is unclear. No other significant differences were found across Part 2 questions across the students' variables.

Part 3 of the survey explored students perceptions of the usefulness of annotating for genre features generally, and in CIRRUS in particular (Fig. 5).

Overall, most students considered the processof annotating genre features in CIRRUs as a useful exercise, with most students positive towards the value of annotating genre exemplars and being exposed to exemplars outside of their discipline, and with most reporting a beter understanding of genres within and outside of their own disciline. Most students reported the anotation process as helpful for improving overall writing ability, grammar, and academic vocabulary knowledge. Importantly, students were poitive that annotating in CIRRUs was more useful than students' prior approaches to genre education, and that fllowing this exercise they were more confident in writing for their discipline. However, significant variation was found among students' responses from the CIT analysis, with responses for Q02, Q04-05, Q10, and Q13-14 affected by students faculty (HABS, $\mathbf { n } = 6 6$ vs HASS, $\mathtt { n } = 2 9 4$ $\mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 \mathrm { \check { \ } }$ at the top level. Within the HABS student body, S.E. Asian students were also more positive overall compared with E. Asian students $( { \mathfrak { p } } =$ .016), while within the HAsS cohort, graduate students $( \mathtt { n } = 1 8 6 ^ { \cdot }$ ) were more positive about annotating genre features in CIRRUS than undergraduate students ${ \bf \tilde { n } } = 1 0 8$ $\mathtt { p } = . 0 1 5 )$ . This variation is represented in Fig. 6:

# 4.2. Interview data

Two major topics emerged from the interviews, the first concentrating on students' prior knowledge and awarenes of genre, and the usefulnessof this knowledge, while the second topic covered the CIRRUS annotation activities the usefulnessof the platform, and suggested criticisms/improvements (Fig. 7).

Participants answered questions about their prior genre knowledge before taking the course and the importance of knowing more about genre for future studies. Fig. 8 describes the themes arising in more detai, inluding their subcategories and frequency of associated codes.

Comments about previous genre knowledge indicated a general understanding of genre, albeit only at a surface level (Excerpts 1 and

Fig. 8. Students' discussion of genre: Themes, categories and codes.

Excerpt 1: \*We haven't really been taught a lot about different genres in different disciplines'. 12.

Excerpt 2: Oh, genre, maybe I just know, very litl. Because in my university, when I was in my university, I didn't need to write the essay very often'. 14

Genre knowledge awarenes relates to comments about the genre knowledge students gained after the academic writing course. In this respect, emerging catgories iludd gre type says), guage use, adjustments in the usef language acos geres, and the purpose of genres in terms of discipline and asessment types. Overal, students reported an increased knowledge and awareness of genre following the activities, improved recognition of certain disciplinary genre characteristics (Excerpts 3 and 4)

Excerpt 3: Let me think in my discipline, Ithink the most important genre is the essay. There are different types. For example, the reflective essay, the critical essay. And also some others, and also the normal essay". I1

Excerpt 4: Like, if you're talking about research you use a certain genre. If you're talking about, let' say ., pronunciation, 1   
changes, or if you feel while ... depending on the type of exercise you're doing, then your genre changes' 16

Regarding genre knowledge usefulness, most participants expressed that learning about genre was useful within university and :elated academic contexts, predominantly for the development of language for improved disciplinary writing, followed by reading comprehension, finding out information, and then speaking, in that order (Excerpts 5 and 6).

Excerpt 5: "So I think it helped me to understand more how it works, and to differentiate, and to find the right information I could find. Yeah." I5.

Excerpt 6: "'ecause when we .. especially write assgnments, and then we need to follow the writing style that suits the academic writing." 110

1.2.2. Students' discussion of annotating for genre features in CIRRUS

In the interviews, participants answered questions about a) what they remembered of the process of annotating genres for disciplinary structural/rhetorical language features using the CIRRUs platform; b) whether the annotation process and activities were helpful in improving understanding of individual texts and writing in the discipline; c) how seeing other students' annotations in class helped with their own annotations and completing coursework assignments; d) areas of difficulty regarding the use of the CIRRUS platform; and e) how the CIRRUs platform activities could be improved (Fig. 9).

Two main cateories emerged from this theme, oneregarding the proces of antation covering the ifferent activities that students remembered, and the other about students perceptions of analysing and annotating the genre exemplars provided through the CIRRUS platform itef Regarding the process the participants recalled first having to read the articles and papers, anotate them in terms of gee, strctre and hrical fres, the orgase, relect, ds, comre andchck their ations wth peers and againsthe model answer' (Excerpts 7-8)

Excerpt 7: I remember that we had to highlight some important elements that must be mentioned in the introduction, for example. The type f language as well if it's personal or impersonal, okay? And the way you organize your ideas as well, that's what I remember doing ..with ciRRus, like highlighting the stance in the essay, the outline in the introduction, and that kind of thing." 18

Excerpt 8: "And then we were able to compare our answers with our partners' answers and to the correct [model] answers as well." 16

Overall, the perception regarding the CIrRRus platform was that it was easy to use with useful functions, albeit with only 12 :omments on this category (Excerpts 9-10).

Excerpt 9: I remember, I think the software is very easy to use, the platform you just selec tthe text] and then you can writ on anything you want." I5

Excerpt 10: \*Well, the platform was really very good and well-organized." 110.

Regarding the annotation activities, students discussed how the processof annotating genre fatures on CIRRUs improved genre understanding, their writing and their performance on course asgnments, as well as the usefulnes of seeing peer and model answer? annotations during their own annotation process Two main categories emerged from this data, namel the usefulness of the process of annotation, and the usefulness of annotations by peers (Fig. 10).

Overall, regarding usefulness of the process of anotating genre fatures, students considered this process as a novel way of learning actively and independently and that these activities were beneficial and useful for their future academic lives, specificall for writing and reading. Regarding writing, knowing more about text structure organisation, generation of ideas, and adequate use of language features according to the type of genre were seen as predominantly useful outcomes of annotation, while anotations for reading were considered useful when distinguishing between and understanding genre and text structures (Excerpts 11-13).

Excerpt 11: I just think it's atool for me to learn the course [ontent] and to know the article, it makes me become active and I need to think not only to receive'. I1

![](img/d7122704d19862cfdc2a5d39252272207685f54a32905478bdf49b4578686f05.jpg)

Fig. 10. Usefulness of CIRRUS annotation activities: Themes, categories and codes.

Excerpt 12: Yes it did. I mean, I developed my understanding of the text, what is the main argument? What are the main points of text, and then also, really, it made me think about the thesis statement, I mean, and then that would you say, how to structure my writing." 110

Excerpt 13: "It helps you to understand, and the real examples of what you are supposed to do when you write." I6 Regarding peers and model answer' annotations, students reported checking others' annotations to understand how annotations should be done, whether their annotations were right or wrong, and the proces of comparing and correcting their own annotations as a result. However, students were more likely to consult the 'model answer' annotations than their peers' finding the former more useful (Excerpts 14-15).

Excerpt 14: \*Yeah, I can know about other cases, and why I am wrong, why I am right and how to avoid those mistakes, like thinking like, why they[other students] made those mistakes?" 19

Excerpt 15: "I think the sample annotation from the teacher is more helpful." I3.

Regarding criticisms and improvements, participants were asked how the CirRRUs platorm activitie could be improved. In this regard, students critiqued the platform, the genre examples, the annotations themselves and their (lack of) evaluation (Fig, 11).

Regarding the CIrRUs platform, students criticized certain functionalities considered confusing (e.g. the way the highlighted text was displayed in different colours,and the verstilit of the platorm in comparison with paper-based approach. Different colours were intended to differentiate individual student' annotations in situations where sections of highlighted text overlapped. Some suggestions were to add more annotation colours, improve the highlighting/draging approach to selecting text for annotation, options to ill n the blanks where text was not present for anotation (meaning the tudents could not annotate that area), and the ability to delete annotations (Excerpt 16).

Excerpt 16: "On a paper you can circle it and, and then connect one point to another one. You can group different ideas. But when you use CIRRUS, you can just highlight different parts and group them in the same colour'. I3

Criticisms of the genre exemplars concerned their perceived quantity and the relationship to the students individual field of study (Excerpt 17). Suggested solutions included shortening the articles or simplifying the texts, as well as including a more significant variety of genres, despite already covering eight genres across 13 subdisciplines in just two weeks.

Excerpt 17: eah, I think it did .. But what I remember as wellis tha it was a itte bit too much. There were o many different texts. So, I think that I paid more, obviously, I paid more attention to the text that was related to the ., to the gnre of my field of study, Aplied Linguistics, but, or Social Sciences, but I cannot read it .. I remember that I was a little bit overwhelmed, because it was a little bit too long that unit'. 18

The criticisms of the annotation activities referred to time consumption, the repetitiveness of the task, or the perception of one tudent that the activities were useles. Suggestions for improvement included reducing the time spent on annotating while consol dating their knowledge with other activities (Excerpts 18 to 19).

![](img/afd4386f63c1ff3493318308e138972b662d5087a3d30d7be3b6e2ebcc3ab0a6.jpg)  
Fig. 11. CIRRUS annotation criticisms and improvements: Themes, categories and codes.

Excerpt 18: "So it was difficult for me to, you know, like do it thoughtfully. So I gottabe honest, I remember that I did it very quickly, because I had a lot of other things to do, and that required a lot of time'. 18

Excerpt 19: ".and, you know, sometimes the annotation part can be quite simple. So maybe we can squeeze these sessions a little bit toallow more illustrations on the genres, the languages and all the other parts ..I also wish we could include more academic language use in that course. Like, just a littl bit more, you have to prepare. Yeah. Because it's a writing class for international students". 12

Students also discussed concerns that their annotations did not appear to be evaluated by tutors in terms of quality but only in juantity, meaning that no matter what they annotated, it was considered acceptable by the tutors. Students suggested improvements or this category areto provide more feedback and hints to know what to annotate, as well as more feedback on the quality/accuracy of innotations (Excerpt 20).

Excerpt 20: "But yes, it's also kind of limited because, like, I'm not sure about other students, but sometimes I wish my com. ments could be like, could be seen by the lecturer, and could be provided some suggestions or advice,". 12

# 5. Discussion

This study has explored students' perceptions of blended genre education involving the online annotation of structural and rhetorical features across multiple disciplines and genres. Overall students racted positively to both the process and product of annotation using a blended approach, although certain challenges raised warrnt improvements to the functionalit of CIRRUS in future practice.

Regarding RQ1, students reported annotating exemplar texts using the online platform was useful for improving knowledge of and confidence in academic writing in general and disciplinary discourses in particular. Positive perceptions of improved genre knowledge, improved writing and reading skill and other language abilitis useful for academic life were also found. Interview respondents characterised their new genre knowledge in the form of improved recognition of genre familie (following Gardner & Nesi's 2013 taxonomy); improved abilit to differentiate argumentative, reflective and critical forms of writing; improved identification of lin guistic fatures used to expressdifferent tones and modes (. (in)forality, ojetivity/subjectvity, (im)prsonality); and improved knowledge of expressions bound to specific academic genre texts Interviewee aso reported improved academic reading skill after annotating pattens of particular structural or rhetorical academic genre feature at both the local paragraph and whole-text levels. At the paragraph level, participants reported being beter able to recognise thesis statements, research questions, main topic sentences, arguments, evidence, and examples, including identifying when to use vocabulary to hedge, link, and provide the writer's stance. At a text structure level, students felt more able to clearly distinguish the introduction, body and conclusion sections of each genre.

These reported findings are encouraging given most participants reported little previous knowledge of or experience of writing academic genres in general beyond esays and with even es i the way of prior discipline-specific gere knowledge, particularly in the case of students from East Asian backgrounds. However, certain interviewees indicated dificult in bridging the gap between being able to recognise and annotat genre features and the act f producing written academic texts, primarily due to poor selfefficacy in terms of the requisite vocabulary and grammar to paraphrase published articles and eventually to writ thir own. Therefore, additional writing practice activities may be needed to complement the acquired knowledge from the annotation tasks. The CITs also reported disciplinary (HABS vs. HASs), region-specific (E. vs. S.E. Asia) and study level (graduate vs. undergraduate) variation in students' perceptions of the overallusefulnessof annotating genre features under blended learning. Some survey respondents were also concerned that the wide variet of unfamiliar genres and disciplines led to dificulties in reading and understanding specific vocabulary from other fields, despite task instructions stressing students were not to attempt to understand all exemplar content Overall, however, most felt the wide range of disciplines and genres served to increase genre knowledge inside and outside their disciplines.

Regarding RQ2, students generally appreciated the affordances of a blended approach for genre annotation in general, and the CIRRUS platform in particular. Respondents considered the CirRus platform easy to use and that the instructions and guiding questions were clear, helping them understand the tas's purpose, what to write when annotating, while promoting independent learning. However, some reported problems with internet connectivity (likely due to many having to use a VPN for access) while certain individual functions of the cIrRus platorm were considered challenging to use. Most of this was evidenced in the interview data, where students stated that the colour, text highlighting and annotation entry functions could be improved. Regarding peer interaction and engagement, some interviewees reported the proces of annotation includes comparison, and correction of individual responses afer seeing classmates' annotations and the suplied model answers, serving to consoldate academic genre knowledge. However other respondents considered viewing others annotations as less helpful as students' annotations were not evaluated for quality nor given any feedback by tutors. This led to a lack of motivation to develop complet annotations (resorting to ust adding the letter of the guiding question), and a distrust of the quality of others' annotations. While the original intention was that exposure to others annotations would help individuals to complete nnotation tass independentl, future itrations of the platform may require annotations to be automatically graded, or a peer-marking system implemented for certain annotation tasks of more frequent genres, such s the esay. Rech n onine per fdback hs found ovious benefits for recipiens f uch fedack, but o for the provider in terms of higher-level learning skill, critical insight, improvements to their own work, knowledge-building, and meaning-making (van Popta et al., 2017).

# 6. Closing comments

The present study is one of the largest to date focusing specificly on EAP genre education under a blended learning format. While EAP students have been annotating gere features for decades, our study has shown that moving the processofannotation online - with annotations in digital form - presents numerous opportunities for improved genre knowledge in the age of massfication of higher education. In terms of the study's limitations, due to dificulties securing interviewee from the mostrcent cohort especilly new undergraduate students) under socially-distanced coviD-19 conditions and international travel bans, graduate and East Asian participants' voices dominate the interview data while the soft disciplines dominate the survey data, and follow-up interviews with undergraduate students from the hard isciplies are particularly recommended so as to beter acertain the value of this proces more broady. In addition, this study has covered students' perceptions of the product and process of annotating genre features, rather than investigating the quality and accuracy of the students annotations themselves. However, given the variety of guiding questions, genres and discilines covered on the course, we acknowledge it may be dificult to meaningfully compare students' annotations in this respect, and many students did not consent to have their data analysed for this purpose. We therefore conclude this paper by calling for more studies focusing specifically on genre education within blended contexts that investigate the quality and accuracy of the annotations performed, or which seek to determine whether annotating for genre features under a blended format leas to improvements in subsequent genre- or discipline-specific academic writing.
