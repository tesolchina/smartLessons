# Abstract

This study aimed to evaluate the implementation of a same-year peer-assisted learning (PAL) scheme, introduced in the first year of an undergraduate degree. The students participated in voluntary timetabled PAL sessions which encouraged a cooperative approach through student-directed activities. An action research design was used, and evaluation at each stage led to subsequent modifications over three years of implementation. Evaluation showed that the majority of students agreed that PAL helped with social aspects of learning but not that PAL contributed to improved study skills or assignment preparation. Between stages 1 and 2 small yet significant improvements in satisfaction occurred, and these continued in stage 3 when clearer guidance was provided. Based on our experience, PAL may provide effective learning environments; however, those interested in implementing it should be warned that it is not an easy option, and students need help to structure sessions effectively.

# Rationale for the implementation of peer-assisted learning

The transition from school or college to an environment which is less structured and requires more self direction, may be particularly challenging for some students and even more so in larger classes (Boud et al., 2001). Therefore the increase in student numbers demands a review of learning and teaching methods as concerns arise about how to maintain engagement with learning in small-group activities (Boud et al., 2001). Faced with these challenges, the use of peer learning as a strategy to enhance student learning and support, without unduly increasing staff–student contact time, is explored in this article.

According to Boud et al. (1999: 413) peer learning can be defined as ‘the use of teaching and learning strategies in which students learn with and from each other without the immediate intervention of a teacher’. A variety of peer-assisted learning (PAL) schemes operate in a number of UK higher education institutions, and there is an even longer tradition in the USA where it is more popularly known as supplemental instruction (Bidgood, 1994; Capstick et al., 2004; Congos and Schoeps, 1998; Playford et al., 1999; Price and Rust, 1994). The majority of these interventions are targeted at enhancing the first year experience and aim to provide an opportunity for students to discuss topics raised from curriculum in a non-threatening environment.

Generally claims are made for the success and wide-ranging benefits of peer learning activities in higher education. These include advantages for the institution and teaching team, such as improved retention (Congos and Schoeps, 1998) and improved course grades (Bidgood, 1994; Parkinson, 2004). For the student involved, benefits include adjusting to university life, improving study skills, acquiring a clear view of the course expectations and an increasing understanding of the subject matter of the course (Capstick et al., 2004). Others have identified more specific benefits of peer learning in areas such as critical reading (Finlay and Faulkner, 2005) or have used more qualitative methods to explore the benefits in relation to the student learning experience (Capstick, 2004).

However, an underlying theoretical assumption in all of this research is that peer learning is beneficial. This is primarily based on the popularity of Vygotsky’s Social Development Theory (Smith et al., 2003) and an acceptance of peers as important contributors to learning. On the contrary, Sim (2003) found that students perceived their peers as the least useful partners in learning, and proposed that students may become cynical about the process. While the premise of the peer learning schemes is to focus on the needs of the learner, more pragmatically the goals may be driven by the institution/tutor and consequently students may not be prepared or willing to learn with their peers.

In addition it seems that much of the peer learning research has taken a ‘positivist’ approach. This is evident in the choice of methods and the discourse used in the concluding claims and is particularly marked in earlier research in the 1990s when there was a focus on student performance or outcome. Often there were comparisons between students categorized into different groups, with peer learning sessions being the independent variable manipulated by the researcher. However, it may be problematic to assume that the cause (peer learning) leads to the effect (good results) in these situations, as there may be a number of other confounding factors. For example, in these studies a popular comparison is between attendees and non-attendees of the sessions (Bidgood, 1994; Congos and Schoeps, 1998; Healy, 1994; Playford et al., 1999; Price and Rust, 1994). In all of these studies, module test results are compared and claims of peer learning success are made based on better test scores in the attendee group. The comparisons are often based on discriminating between non-attendees and attendees by an arbitrary number of sessions attended. For example, the cut-off point for attendees has ranged from one or more (Price and Rust, 1994) to two or more (Bidgood, 1994) or five or more (Playford et al., 1999). As most PAL schemes are based on voluntary participation, attendance may be variable, but there is often limited acknowledgement of this in the papers. Perhaps some of these earlier studies set out to prove the value or success of the scheme to warrant its continuity? In one study, cost-effectiveness outcomes were extrapolated from those students who continued to attend supplemental instruction (Congos and Schoeps, 1998). These authors claimed that attendance correlated strongly with retention, and thus course funding was secured in subsequent years. Subsequently such claims have persuaded educators, including ourselves, to introduce similar schemes elsewhere (Capstick, 2004).

The most common model of PAL is that of cross-level peer tutoring (Falchikov, 2001), whereby a student leader from a higher year level helps to facilitate classroom-based activities. Other models do exist, such as same-year PAL groups; however, few studies have examined their use for enhancing student learning in a particular discipline or even more broadly in higher education. In same-year PAL a group of peers (students) are encouraged to alternate roles of tutor and tutee over a number of different sessions (Falchikov, 2001). Goodlad and Hirst (1989) suggest that tutorless groups motivate students to become more involved with their own learning, and Falchikov (2001) suggests they encourage greater respect for each team member. Others argue that this is more favourable than peer tutor models, as the presence of an apparently more knowledgeable learner may still encourage a passive approach to learning (Ladyshewsky, 2000). However, these articles are largely opinion based and there is a lack of empirical evidence in higher education.

Therefore this study aimed to examine some of the claims for peer-assisted learning. In particular we were interested in evaluating the implementation and development of a same-year PAL scheme by seeking student opinion. We wished to identify factors that contributed to the students’ satisfaction with peer learning sessions and their perceived role in assisting their learning, in order to continue to help staff plan, modify and improve peer learning processes locally. We hope that by doing so other educators hoping to implement similar schemes elsewhere may gain insight based on our experience.

# Methods

An action research design was chosen as this reflected the underlying premise of promoting improvement, change and development (Robson, 2002). The implementation of PAL was evaluated via student satisfaction, then analysed to reflect on and modify the PAL based on these results, and then re-evaluated. This study represents the first three cycles of this process over three years of implementation.

# PAL sessions at first implementation in 2003

PAL sessions were first introduced in the second term of the first year of an undergraduate physiotherapy programme in January 2003. An interprofessional common foundation programme in the first term prevented the introduction of unidisciplinary sessions at an earlier point. The year group $( n = 7 2 )$ ) was randomly divided into small groups of approximately 8–10 students. All first year students in the undergraduate physiotherapy programme had an opportunity to participate in the voluntary PAL sessions. Initially three timetabled PAL sessions were arranged in term 2 and students were then encouraged to plan further meetings at times that suited the group. Rooms could be booked by arrangement with the course administrator.

Students were given an introductory lecture on PAL which covered: structure, aims, benefits, guidance on selecting roles within the group, guidance on selecting topics for discussion and methods for running the sessions. Students elected a chairperson and scribe from their group for each classroom-based session. An emphasis was placed on cooperation, team work and active problem solving. At the initial session a case study was presented to give the students an experience of the learning opportunities that small group discussion offered. The students could choose to continue to focus on the case study in the second session, or pursue self-selected learning issues related to recent lectures or practical sessions. Lecturers were encouraged to suggest possible topics for discussion in the PAL sessions but essentially the sessions remained student-directed. A handout was also given to provide further guidance and students were encouraged to complete a session plan and summary of each session and return it to one of the PAL coordinators (who were members of the course team).

# The evaluation tool

A search of the literature revealed no evidence of a standardized evaluation tool. Bournemouth University used an evaluation questionnaire devised by Capstick and Fleming (2001) to evaluate student perceptions and satisfaction with the PAL scheme. This questionnaire was most suited to the aims of the PAL implementation in the undergraduate physiotherapy programme and was modified, with permission, to be used in the evaluation of the PAL sessions (a copy of the questionnaire can be obtained from the corresponding author). The questionnaire was divided into two sections. In the first, students were asked to rate each of 12 statements in response to the question ‘If you have been to any PAL sessions, do you agree or disagree that they contributed to the following?’ on a five-point scale – strongly disagree, disagree, don’t know, agree and strongly agree. The second section of the questionnaire asked about the number of sessions attended and, if students had not attended, their reasons for this. A further item was added to the 2004 and 2005 questionnaire which asked students what they thought would facilitate PAL sessions more effectively.

# Data collection and analysis

Students were invited to complete questionnaires, based on their experiences in the PAL sessions, during a timetabled teaching session in all years of the project. Students were randomly assigned to complete the PAL questionnaire or another questionnaire, based on their peer learning experience in the clinical environment. No student completed both questionnaires as it was felt that, because some of the questions were very similar, students might compare their opinions for each of these questions. Only the data related to the PAL sessions are presented in this analysis.

In the first year, 2003, descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the PAL sessions in the first stage of the action research and inform future modifications. Again, in the second and third years of the project, descriptive statistics were used to re-evaluate the PAL sessions; however, inferential statistics were also used to compare the years. As the data are categorical, consisting of counts of the number of responses in each category, tests of association were carried out by $\chi ^ { 2 }$ tests, or Fisher’s exact test where expected numbers in many of the cells are very small. Statistical tests were carried out using the package SAS. Throughout, the null hypothesis was that there is no association between the year and response. The null hypothesis was rejected if the resulting $p$ -value was less than 0.05, leading to the conclusion that there is some association between year and response.

# Results

The results are presented in order of the three cycles of implementation, and so start with the initial evaluation in 2003, followed by reflections and modifications and then subsequent evaluation and so on.

# Evaluation 2003

Twenty-six students completed the questionnaire in 2003 (from a total of 36) which represents a $72 \%$ response rate. Students were asked to record whether they had attended 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or more sessions. Table 1 shows the frequencies and percentages for attendance at the PAL sessions. From the table it can be seen that in 2003 only $40 \%$ of the students stated they attended three or more sessions.

Students were also asked to indicate their agreement or disagreement with 12 statements. The percentages of students who responded in each category for each of these twelve statements are given in Figure 1.

Over $50 \%$ of students agreed or strongly agreed with the statements that the PAL sessions gave them ‘an opportunity to clarify basic concepts’, and ‘an opportunity to air concerns away from teaching staff’. Additionally over $50 \%$ of respondents felt that PAL contributed to ‘social aspects of learning (learning with others)’ and ‘obtaining others perspectives on the course’. Generally for 8 out of the 12 statements, there was either greater than $50 \%$ disagreement or ambivalence (students chose the ‘don’t know’ response). These included considering whether PAL sessions helped to understand complex concepts, understand course expectations or develop study skills. Most students did not feel PAL sessions contributed to the emotional aspects such as reassurance, confidence or enjoyment of learning.

# Reflection and modifications for 2004

Although the majority had the skills to find that ‘learning with others’ and ‘obtaining others’ perspectives’ were satisfactory experiences, many did not derive sufficient emotional support from their peer group, suggesting that they required more guidance and tutor support. Therefore modifications were considered in discussions with the academic team and students. To the induction programme was added an increased emphasis on role selection and rotation of responsibilities, and for the first time small icebreaking activities were included within the PAL group. Furthermore, for the initial two sessions, a case-based learning scenario was provided. The case scenario featured a hypothetical ‘patient’ with particular signs and symptoms, and students were given prompt questions to discuss. This approach encouraged students to interpret the findings and identify their own learning needs and those of the group. Further information and prompt questions were given at the subsequent session, and students were encouraged to discuss their previously identified learning needs. The students were familiar with this process, which was conducted on a weekly basis throughout term 1 with a tutor present. This was intended to provide a balance between directed (the case and prompt questions) and self-directed learning (setting own learning outcomes) and encourage students to develop confidence in themselves and their peers within the boundaries of the given case.

Another modification was that ‘stand-by’ tutor support was initially available in the first two sessions. The tutor was not present in the classroom, but checked on a number of groups from time to time. The role of the tutor was to be available for troubleshooting issues related to ‘getting going’ but tutors were encouraged not to lead the tutorials or provide syllabus specific advice. Students were encouraged to select other topics for discussion, once group members had identified how they had worked in their team, and support throughout the rest of the term was provided by email by the PAL coordinator.

# Evaluation 2004

Of the 41 students invited to complete the questionnaire in 2004, 39 completed it $9 5 \%$ response rate). There was increased attendance at the sessions with $74 \%$ of students attending three or more sessions (see Table 1). On average, attendance at the PAL sessions was greater in 2004 than in 2003, with the mode and median attendance in 2003 being two sessions compared with four sessions in 2004. The questionnaire analysis for the response for the 12 statements can be seen in Figure 2.

The findings demonstrate that, overall, there was greater agreement in all 12 statements than the previous year and an improvement in general satisfaction in the PAL sessions in 2004. This change reached statistical significance in many of those statements in which there was greater than $50 \%$ disagreement or ambivalence in 2003. Tests of association showed that there were significant differences in the students’ responses in 2003 and 2004 for statements related to: ‘understanding subject matter of the course’, ‘enjoyment of learning’, ‘opportunity to clarify complex concepts’, ‘development of my study skills’, ‘better preparation for assignments’ and ‘reassurance about course related concerns’. However, statements in which there continued to be greater disagreement than agreement included ‘development of my study skills’, ‘better preparation for assignments’ and ‘awareness of course expectations’.

In all years, students completing the PAL questionnaires were asked why they had not attended more (or any) sessions. A significant percentage $( 5 3 . 3 \% )$ of those questioned in 2003 felt that the sessions would not be helpful, and this proportion reduced by approximately one half (to $2 7 . 5 \%$ )

![](img/0cf8f407d5a2a58a6c74a7ae4a9c7c5963b2edc25a074b0c0153a5745ca9562a.jpg)

in 2004. However, in 2004, students’ reasons for non-attendance were more likely to be linked to convenience. For example, students suggested they did not know about the sessions ( $10 \%$ in 2003, $2 2 . 5 \%$ in 2004) or that they were at inconvenient times/days ( $23 \%$ in 2003, $30 \%$ in 2004). In addition students in 2004 were also asked what would facilitate the PAL sessions. The great majority of students suggested that PAL sessions would be facilitated by having the PAL groups linked to their personal tutor $( 6 8 \% )$ and having more structure $( 7 0 \% )$ . Over $40 \%$ of the students felt that having a second or third year student present or having questions to answer for each session would facilitate the sessions. Six students $( 1 5 \% )$ felt that having some assessment linked to PAL would facilitate the group.

# Reflection and modifications for 2005

Although the findings were more promising and led to greater student satisfaction, the evaluation helped to provide useful information for the academic team. PAL sessions continued for the following year with minor modifications based on the above findings and recommendations. These modifications included providing each student with a PAL guidebook (developed locally) and linking the groups to a personal tutor, so that troubleshooting advice could also be linked to pastoral advice. A discussion board was also set up via the virtual learning environment to enable students to communicate about organizing the sessions or feedback from them.

# Evaluation 2005

Twenty-six students $( n = 4 0$ ) completed the questionnaire in 2005 (response rate $6 5 \%$ ) and findings were similar to 2004. Attendance figures continued to be promising (see Table 1). The questionnaire analysis of the responses for the 12 statements can be seen in Figure 3. Tests of association showed that there was no significant difference in the students’ responses in 2004 and 2005 for any of the statements. However, what can be observed is that students were less ambivalent in 2005, with fewer students selecting the ‘don’t know’ category.

# Discussion and conclusion

Overall this study demonstrated that students responded favourably to the social aspects of the peer learning sessions. Students valued ‘obtaining other people’s perspectives’, ‘learning with others’ and the ‘opportunity to air concerns away from teaching staff’ and in the main the sessions contributed to their enjoyment of learning. Evaluation suggests that students found peer learning sessions helpful to understand the subject matter of the course including clarifying basic concepts, but they were less likely to agree that sessions helped clarify complex concepts. Furthermore the majority of students did not think that the sessions helped them to understand the course expectations, or to develop their study skills or to prepare for, and achieve better in, assessment tasks.

This study provides a unique perspective in the landscape of peer learning research. First, the findings of this evaluation are of a same-year tutorless PAL scheme, in contrast to the majority of peer learning schemes, which adopt a peer tutor from a higher year level to facilitate activity (Boud et al., 2001; Capstick et al., 2004; Falkichov, 2001). Second, many PAL evaluations tend to be comparisons pre-post or first and second rounds. By using an action research approach we were able to go through three cycles of implementation and improvement, demonstrating some areas of early improvements which were then maintained.

Like other innovators and researchers in peer learning (Boud et al., 2001; Capstick et al., 2004; Falkichov, 2001), similar levels of positive evaluation were found in relation to the social aspects of learning, suggesting students valued and enjoyed opportunities to learn collaboratively. We found that the students perceived the sessions as an opportunity to sound out ideas away from lecturers without fear of the embarrassment that is common when trying to learn from/with an expert (Baldry Currens, 2003). Although it may be argued that students have many opportunities to discuss topics in an informal way outside classes, the PAL sessions may be a valuable way of formalizing this communication process and effectively ‘allowing’ students to learn together.

The majority of students in this evaluation did not feel the PAL sessions gave them greater awareness of the course expectations. This may not be surprising as Wadoodi and Crosby (2002: 243) suggest same-year tutoring PAL has ‘the advantage of greater informality but can also suffer from lack of direction’. Apart from the broad aims communicated to the students in this study, there was no specific goal to be assessed as a result of the peer learning sessions. This may explain the lower levels of agreement with this statement about greater awareness of course expectations. When given the opportunity in the subsequent two years of the implementation, the majority of students preferred more structured PAL sessions or the involvement of a tutor to oversee the process.

There is a great body of literature on self-regulated learning that suggests motivation, planning and self-evaluation are essential for learning (Boekaerts, 1999; Schunk, 2005), and Kolb et al. (1994) argue that learning is directed by one’s own goals. This may provide a strong argument for allowing students to develop their own learning outcomes for peer learning sessions and avoiding giving more direction. Others, however, encourage engagement in peer learning by linking it to assessment tasks (Capstick, 2004; Capstick et al., 2004; Falchikov, 2001). The issue of linking peer learning opportunities to assessment continues to present a conundrum for educators, but, from our experience, it may be necessary to link the sessions to relevant curriculum learning outcomes, so that students can identify a clear purpose for the sessions.

It has previously been suggested that peer learning contributes to a deeper approach to learning (Falchikov, 2001; Ladyshewsky, 2000; Topping, 1996). Based on this study we have reservations for such claims. In order to clarify complex concepts it is proposed that students would need to seek meaning, relate ideas and use a variety of cognitive skills that are congruent with a deep approach to learning (Marton and Saljo, 1997; Tait and Entwistle, 1996). Therefore the two statements in the survey that relate to understanding basic and complex concepts may differentiate ‘surface’ or ‘deep’ approaches to learning. However, it remains unclear whether students found the sessions useful for clarifying complex concepts, so we must question whether PAL promotes a deep approach to learning, especially where material or preparation to ‘scaffold’ the sessions is lacking. Our findings may also suggest contrasting group approaches to the peer learning sessions. Research by Yan and Kember (2003, 2004) identified two main learning behaviours for out-of-class student groups. They describe an ‘engager’ approach as one in which students collaborated to achieve a better understanding of issues or concepts, and an ‘avoider’ approach as one in which students cooperated to share workload and minimize tasks. Whether each group adopted an ‘engager’ or ‘avoider’ approach may also explain the findings in our study.

Our findings might also be explained by the students’ perception that the PAL sessions were additional and inconvenient, highlighting one of the main pitfalls that others have also noted (Boud et al., 2001; Capstick et al., 2004; Goodlad and Hirst, 1989). Therefore we agree that PAL sessions must be carefully organized and incorporated in the students’ timetable and curriculum, and not be seen as additional to it.

Finally, the evaluation demonstrated that the majority of students did not agree that peer learning sessions improved their study skills and assignment preparation. Again this is hardly surprising as interventions specifically designed to improve study skills have often been found to be ineffective, especially in higher education (Hattie et al., 1996). Therefore from our experience it is important to be explicit about what peer learning is, and is not, intended to achieve.

There are some limitations of this study. Firstly the students were from one health professional programme, and therefore results may not be representative of other institutions or fields of study. In addition the evaluation was carried out in the first year of undergraduate study and may reflect the students’ level and less mature approach to learning. Caution should also be taken in generalizing the findings from this study as this comparison was made from different student cohorts and the convenience sampling method used may not provide a balanced representation of each of the

PAL groups. Furthermore as the development of the peer learning sessions was pragmatic in nature any changes in student perceptions from 2003 to 2005, whether significant or not, are likely to be multifactorial, and only those congruent with the 12 statements have been presented in this article. Other issues related to group dynamics may have influenced student perceptions, and the questionnaire was insufficient in seeking these views. There is some artificiality of forcing students to collaborate, especially when there is little incentive for them to do so in the form of assessment. Other researchers suggest that groups may take some time to become productive (Sadlo, 1994). Although we provided a case scenario for the first two sessions to help reduce some of the initial tensions there were only a relatively small number of sessions timetabled, let alone attended, and these factors may have influenced the results.

Based on the results of this study there are a number of unanswered questions which prompt further study. Is there a relationship between approaches to learning (for example, surface, deep or achieving) and peer learning session attendance, satisfaction, etc.? How is learning for and within peer learning sessions negotiated? What is the influence of group approaches to peer learning on individual engagement and satisfaction? And finally does PAL promote less-formal group activities outside the classroom? Many of the above questions require qualitative investigation, which is limited in research on peer learning. Although this work is ongoing we would encourage others to adopt an action research approach to evaluate peer learning.

In summary, the benefits from same-year peer learning sessions may not be directly observable after one or two iterations, but with evaluation and development can be adapted for better results. We would encourage educators to be clear about what PAL might achieve and what it will not. Our results suggest that developing same-year peer learning sessions is not an easy option and may be as resource intensive as tutor-led sessions. We would suggest that those developing such a scheme need to consider designing and timetabling sessions so that they are linked to the curriculum/ learning outcomes and not perceived as additional to it. We would also suggest investment in student support for facilitating group activity, for example by providing workshops, guidance notes and ongoing mentoring opportunities.
