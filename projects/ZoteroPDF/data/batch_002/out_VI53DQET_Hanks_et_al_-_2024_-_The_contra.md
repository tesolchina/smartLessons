Both Business English as a Lingua Franca (BELF) and Legal English as a Lingua Franca (LELF) users engage with legal contracts regularly. However, contractual language is notoriously complex, due in part to the vocabulary it contains. To help mitigate the challenges related to learning the vocabulary of contracts, this paper introduces a word list of American English contracts called the Contracts Word List (CWL). We describe the compilation of the Corpus of English Business Contracts (CEBC) that represents six major contract types in 48 million words. The extraction of prevalent and specialized words from the CEBC is described, following validation procedures in terms of the word list’s reliability and stability. The final word lists contains 684 lemmas along with definitions, parts of speech, illustrative concordance lines, and adjusted frequencies from the full corpus and each major contract sub-type. We provide recommendations to ELF professionals and teachers on using the CWL.

# 1. Introduction

English is the most common lingua franca used for international business and law communications (Anesa, 2019; Kankaanranta and Planken, 2010). Both users of Business English as a Lingua Franca (BELF) and Legal English as a Lingua Franca (LELF) engage with legal contracts regularly, but contract language is notoriously complex due in part to the vocabulary that they contain (e.g., Townley, 2021). Both L1 and L2 English speakers may find the lexicon of contracts challenging, but additional demands are placed on L2 users because some terminology in American English contracts lack equivalent translations in their L1 (Anesa, 2019). To mitigate some of the challenges speakers of BELF and LEFL face in terms of contractual vocabulary, this paper introduces a word list of American English contracts (the Contracts Word List; CWL).

Specialized word lists, such as the Academic Word List (Coxhead, 2000) and the Basic Engineering List (Ward, 2009), have promoted the teaching and learning of vocabulary by drawing attention to the most important lexical items in a particular domain, which helps make effective use of limited class time. However, in order for a word list to be a maximally useful resource, several considerations must be accounted for in their creation. Specifically, the corpus must be carefully selected (Nation and Sorell, 2016), the unit of observation should be clarified (e.g., word family, lemma, type; Dang and Webb, 2016), both prevalent and specialized words must be identified (Watson Todd, 2017), and the full word list should be stable (Egbert et al., in press).

Through consideration of each of these factors, we create a new word list of English language contracts. The aim of our Contracts Word List (CWL) is to provide a resource that can facilitate the acquisition of contract-specific vocabulary for those who require highly advanced skills in reading and/or writing contracts (e.g., BELF and LELF users). In this paper, we describe the process of creating the CWL and offer recommendations for its use.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Contract users

Over the past several decades, English has become the most common lingua franca used for international business and law communications (Anesa, 2019; Kankaanranta and Planken, 2010). Within the domain of Business English as a Lingua Franca (BELF), business professionals have an increased need to communicate information in written and spoken English with clarity (Kankaanranta and Planken, 2010). In a series of interviews with BELF users, Kankaanranta and Planken (2010) revealed that business professionals perceive knowledge of technical language and the ability to clearly convey meaning as essential components of communication. Similarly, users of Legal English as a Lingua Franca (LELF) are expected to use technical, precise language to correspond with colleagues and clients (Anesa, 2019; Kankaanranta and Planken, 2010; Vogt, 2004). In particular, they often need to adapt their language to emphasize precision (as is the norm in American English contracts) over conciseness (as is the norm in Civil Law countries in South America, Europe, and Asia) (Cabrita, 2012; Llopis, 2017). ELF users in both business and legal professions engage with contracts regularly, which places additional demands on their linguistic and interactional competence.

# 2.2. Contractual language

Contracts are agreements that establish how a relationship between two or more parties is managed (Singh, 2010) and are commonplace in both business (BELF) and legal (LELF) settings. However, understanding contracts can be difficult because the register characteristics as well as rhetorical and textual conventions are highly distinctive (Balogh, 2019; Chandler and Hashimoto, 2024). This is due to the particular communicative functions that are special to contracts as well as the maintenance of particular historical and traditional conventions of the genre, all of which lead to peculiar language use within contracts. They are complex at the sentence level, in which dense nominal phrases lead to a high number of propositions per sentence (Lin et al., 2023). At the word level, the lexicon of contracts is also particularly challenging. Many words used in contracts – such as shall and accrue – are rarely used in other contexts, and others – such as share and balance – often have specialized meanings in contracts (see Grima, 2019). This “technical jargon” is sometimes referred to, often pejoratively, as legalese because it is “difficult to understand or use” (Townley, 2021, p. 6). Given the complexity of contracts at a discourse, sentence, and word level, it is unsurprising that even highly educated and advanced English speakers can struggle to comprehend the language of this register.1

The complexity of contractual language presents major challenges for L2 English speakers. Because the meanings of words are tied to social and cultural processes which may differ between jurisdictions, specific terminology in American English contracts may lack equivalent translations in an individual’s L1 (Anesa, 2019). Thus, language learners must first understand the “discursive practices” of another country in order to understand the specific terminology (Anesa, 2019, p. 19). Receptive understanding of contract vocabulary is highly consequential, as differing interpretations of a single lexical item can lead to considerable and practical loss of property, privileges, access, and so forth (Mouritsen, 2019). However, receptive vocabulary knowledge is often not sufficient since business and legal professionals are also regularly required to draft or edit contracts; therefore, L2 English speakers must have productive knowledge of highly specialized contract vocabulary – including mastery of each word’s semantic mappings, morphology, and collocations – in order to fulfill the demands of their position.

To alleviate some of the challenges BELF and LEFL users face in terms of contractual language, this paper introduces a word list of American English contract vocabulary (the Contracts Word List; CWL).

# 2.3. Word lists for language learning

Words lists have been developed for use in various language-learning contexts. By referring to word lists, teacher and student attention can be drawn to the most prevalent lexical items in a particular domain. Prevalent lexical items are those that are more highly frequent and/or dispersed, which may therefore be considered important for students to learn (Egbert and Burch, 2023). By identifying prevalent words, researchers may help instructors and students make effective use of the limited study time available by exposing them to the words they are most likely to encounter. General service lists provide a core lexicon of words that occur frequently across a range of registers and texts (e.g., the General Service List, West, 1953; the New General Service List or new-GSL, Brezina and Gablasova, 2015; the New General Service List or NGSL, Browne, 2014; the Essential Word List, Dang and Webb, 2016). These lists have been instrumental in creating graded readers and other L2 teaching materials (Wan-a-rom, 2008), lexical profiling resources such as the Compleat Lexical Tutor (www.lextutor.ca; Cobb, 2007), and vocabulary tests such as the Vocabulary Levels Test (McLean and Kramer, 2015; Nation, 1990). In addition, several specialized word lists aim to help students acquire context-specific vocabulary have been used for classroom materials as well as individual study (Lessard-Clouston, 2013). Some specialized word lists include:

Academic Word List (AWL; Coxhead, 2000)   
Academic Vocabulary List (AVL; Gardner and Davies, 2014)   
Secondary Vocabulary Lists (SVL; Green and Lambert, 2018),   
Middle School Vocabulary List (MSVL) for Science (Greene and Coxhead, 2015)   
 Digital Science List (DSL) for middle-school learners (Arndt, 2022)   
Medical Academic Word List (Wang et al., 2008)   
New Medical Academic Word List (Lei and Liu, 2016)   
Basic Engineering List (Ward, 2009)   
Opaque Engineering Word List (Watson Todd, 2017)   
Plumbing Word List (Coxhead and Demecheleer, 2018)

The word lists created thus far have served as useful resources for language learning, and the methods of such lists have continuously improved, although some methodological limitations still exist. To create a reliable word list, Brezina and Gablasova (2017) propose three general steps, including (1) defining the construct, or determining which types of vocabulary should be sought out, (2) operationalizing the construct, or determining which words are most prevalent and/or important, and (3) considering the word list’s pedagogical potential, or determining how the list should be constructed to provide the maximum benefit to end users (i.e., students and teachers).

Within each of these steps lay several decision points that can affect the overall quality of a word list, including, importantly, the choice of corpus or corpora used as a data source. The corpus’s composition should reflect the target domain of the word list (Nation and Sorell, 2016), and the size must be large enough to yield stable lexical results (Egbert et al., 2022). Stability is “the degree to which linguistic findings based on one corpus can be replicated based on a different corpus, where both corpora claim to represent the same target language domain” (Egbert et al., in press). Stability is important because a stable word list contains words that students are more likely to encounter, thus improving its utility. Previous research has suggested that stability can be improved by creating word lists that are (1) relatively short, and (2) based on a large corpus (Egbert et al., 2022), yet specialized word lists have regularly been developed using small corpora that are unlikely to contain stable measures of lexis (e.g., the Basic Engineering List was based on a corpus of 250,000 words). Establishing the definition of a “word” is another decision point (Gardner, 2007): some word lists use word families (e.g., the Academic Word List, Medical Academic Word List, and Middle School Vocabulary List for Science), which may disregard important word types while also minimizing students’ need for morphological training (Kremmel, 2016). Identification of prevalent words is another critical step, in which important words are identified in terms of how frequently they occur and how dispersed they are in the corpus. Most word lists set separate criteria for frequency and dispersion to identify prevalent lexical items, but these cutoffs are largely arbitrary. Finally, validating the word list for word prevalence, specialization, and stability is integral to determining how useful the resource may be for a target student population.

# 2.4. The Contracts Word List

This paper presents a new word list of English language contracts that was developed based on an approach that aims to minimize such methodological limitations. The goal of our Contracts Word List (CWL) is to provide a resource for BELF and LELF users and teachers through development of a list of prevalent and specialized words found in American English contracts. The CWL may serve as a resource to facilitate the acquisition of contract-specific vocabulary for those who require highly advanced skills in reading and writing contracts. In this paper, we

1. compile a Corpus of English Business Contracts (CEBC) that represents six major contract types;   
2. construct a Contracts Word List (CWL) by extracting lemmas that are prevalent and specialized;   
3. provide evidence for the validity, stability, and reliability of the CWL; and   
4. provide recommendations for use of the CWL to ELF professionals and teachers.

# 3. Compiling the corpus

The first step in creating a word list is selecting an appropriate corpus. Some corpora of contractual English exist and have yielded valuable insights into the language of contracts in terms of their rhetoric, contrast with other languages, and potential for automated analysis (e.g., Cao and Zhao, 2019; Andrades Moreno, 2014; Faber and Lauridsen, 2011; Funaki et al., 2020, respectively). However, these corpora are not ideal for the development of a word list due to their composition and/or size. For example, the parallel bilingual Spanish and English corpus compiled by Andrades Moreno (2014) consists of sample contracts, which limits the extent to which the vocabulary it contains may be generalized to authentic contracts. On the other hand, Curtotti and McCreath’s (2011) corpus contains authentic contracts that fall under Australian jurisdiction, but at only 256 texts and one million words is quite small for word list creation, which may constrain the extent to which a study on lexis yields reliable results. Because a suitable corpus did not exist, we chose to compile one. The Corpus of English Business Contracts (CEBC) was created to include diverse contract types, authentic contracts, and many texts.

In building the corpus, we took into account domain considerations by describing the domain, operationalizing the domain, and planning the sample (Egbert et al., 2022, Chapter 4). Within this framework, the first step to building a corpus is conducting a domain analysis. This step entails first learning about the target domain, or the real-world language domain that the corpus aims to represent, followed by operationalizing the domain by identifying which texts can realistically be collected for the corpus. In carrying out these preliminary steps, researchers may evaluate the strengths and limitations of the planned corpus in terms of how closely its contents match the target domain.

We followed these guidelines to describe the domain of American English contracts (i.e., the population of texts that the corpus will ideally represent) and the operationalized domain (i.e., the subset of texts we could feasibly collect for inclusion in the CEBC) in order to evaluate how closely they align. Knowledge of the corpus’s strengths and constraints can help us ascertain the extent to which our word list can be generalized to contractual language as a whole.

In describing the domain, we compiled a list of frequently used contract types based on insights from a contract professor, legal textbooks, and reputable websites (e.g., Anderson and Warner, 2016; Law Insider, n.d.; Malven, 2015; Randall, 2020; Singh, 2010; Valbrune, 2019; Westlaw, n.d.), yielding a total of 57 common contract types. We created definitions for each type by examining authentic contracts filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and referring to several textbooks and reports (e.g., Anderson and Warner, 2016; Malven, 2015; Randall, 2020; Singh, 2010; Valbrune, 2019) as well as online resources (e.g., Law Insider, n.d.; Westlaw, n.d.). Including diverse contract types in the corpus helped ensure that the resulting word list includes lexical items that are prevalent across sub-fields of law and business, therefore more closely reflecting general contractual langauge.

We then operationalized the domain by considering which texts could be collected for use in the CEBC. In order to do this, we combined several contract types that had identical purposes using the definitions we created. For instance, stock option agreements were combined with option agreements because they both outline an opportunity for the party to purchase an asset. We also used these definitions to group contracts with similar functions into several categories. The final operationalized domain includes six major contract types that describe domain areas (business management contracts, sales-related contracts, employment contracts, investment management contracts, leasing and loan financing contracts, and business assurance contracts) which are further divided into 54 sub-types that describe specific types of contract agreements (see the appendix for descriptions of all contract types). We acknowledge that hundreds of other contract types exist (e.g., Law Insider, n.d.), but the corpus contains only the types that arose repeatedly as being highly meaningful in our research. In addition, we recognize that many contract drafters learn about contracts through study of clause types (e.g., confidentiality clause, best endeavors clause, etc.) rather than contract types (e.g., employment agreement, partnership agreement, etc.). However, we decided that organizing the CEBC by contract type would make it more useful to a broader audience: many sub-fields of law and business can be represented across contract types, meaning the list can be beneficial for professionals in any of these areas.

Authentic contracts that had been utilized for business agreements between a business and either another business or consumer(s) were available from Law Insider (n.d.) and Westlaw (n.d.) after having been filed with the SEC. We sampled contracts from our operationalized domain using stratified sampling within Law Insider to collect 50 authentic contracts from each sub-type. When fewer than 50 contracts of one type were available in Law Insider, we used stratified sampling within Westlaw to fill the remaining slots. Agreements that went into effect in the United States between 2000 and 2022, according to the date listed within the contract, were included. Modifications and amendments that went into effect on a date other than the original contract are also included in the corpus. After all contracts were collected, each was manually checked to ensure it had been classified into the correct contract type and sub-type. We ensured there were no repeated contracts by first using ProtAnt (Anthony and Baker, 2015), a free software created to compare the prototypicality of texts based on the number of keywords they contain. When the values (e.g., word count and keyness scores) between two or more texts within each subtype were identical or nearly identical, we manually checked the contracts to determine whether they were the same. We replaced those that were repeated (e.g., identical contracts or contracts that were differentiated only by their date).

The final corpus composition is shown in Table 1. The total corpus contains 2,700 texts and almost 48 million words. Large corpus sizes such as this are ideal for creating word lists, as it helps ensure lexical items occur frequently enough for a fair assessment of prevalence to be made (Arndt, 2022; Egbert et al., 2022; Nation and Sorell, 2016; see Section 2.3). However, the inclusion of 50 contracts for each sub-type led to differences in size between the six types, as some contain more sub-types than others (e.g., business assurance contracts contain 150 texts across three sub-types, and leasing and loan financing contracts contain 500 texts across 10 sub-types). While this could potentially skew word list results, we took steps to alleviate this issue while creating the word list (discussed in Section 4) and assessed the extent of potential skewing after the word list was created (see section 5). The full list of contract types with definitions is available in the appendix.

# 4. Building the word list

We constructed the Contracts Word List (CWL) based on the CEBC by extracting lemmas that are both prevalent and specialized. Figure 1 provides an overview of words in the CEBC that are prevalent and/or specialized. By identifying only lemmas that are prevalent and specialized in the word list (the top right quadrant of Figure 1), we sought to include words that are important to the domain and therefore beneficial for learners to know (Watson Todd, 2017). The following paragraphs describe our decision to operationalize words as lemmas as well as our process for extracting prevalent and specialized words.

![](img/9dba422e8bd209c078d42200e5292f9d2840605892f8c119f4bfcbbb1267da64.jpg)  
Figure 1. Prevalent and/or specialized words in the CEBC.

Although some word lists are based on word families (i.e., types that are connected through derivational and inflectional morphology), the CWL is based on lemmas (i.e., types that are connected only through inflectional morphology) for several reasons. First, word lists based on families have been criticized for lacking information about part of speech, which is essential for learners to use words appropriately (Gardner and Davies, 2014; Lei and Liu, 2016). In addition, students may waste time learning all derivational forms in a word family, even though some derivations may be infrequent and ultimately not useful (Lei and Liu, 2016). It has also been shown that understanding derivational word relationships is an advanced skill that can be partly acquired only when students reach an advanced level of proficiency (Nippold and Sun, 2008; Schmitt and Zimmerman, 2002), suggesting that users may not be able to take full advantage of a word list organized by family. As such, we followed several other word list creators (e.g., Brezina and Gablasova, 2015; Gardner and Davies, 2014; Green and Lambert, 2018) in utilizing lemmas rather than word families to create a list that will be maximally beneficial to students. We lemmatized the corpus using the base English model in Stanza via Python combined with manual checking (Qi et al., 2020).

In terms of prevalence, we searched for words that occur at regular intervals (i.e., are dispersed) and appear relatively often (i.e., are frequent) in the CEBC. We accounted for dispersion in several ways. First, we excluded lemmas that are not present in at least $5 \%$ of the texts in each sub-type. This step was taken to (1) alleviate some concern about imbalance in the size of the corpus across contract types and (2) reduce the computational power required by later steps. Both frequency and dispersion were then accounted for by calculating the adjusted frequency of the remaining 1,464 words. We calculated adjusted frequency by multiplying each lemma’s mean text frequency $\left( F _ { T } \right)$ by its dispersion $D _ { A }$ ; Egbert et al., 2020). We used this measure of adjusted frequency because it accounts for varying text lengths and can more effectively quantify the prevalence of words that occur throughout the corpus (Egbert and Burch, 2023). The use of adjusted frequency also helped with ranking the words in order of prevalence since it provides information about both word frequency and dispersion in a single value. Lemmas with higher adjusted frequencies were ranked as higher prevalence since they are more frequent and/or dispersed in the corpus.

The initial list of 1,464 prevalent lemmas was further refined to include only words that are specialized to the domain of contracts. This was done by checking each lemma in two versions of Black’s Law Dictionary (2nd or 11th editions) and excluding words that did not have entries in the dictionary. Black’s Law Dictionary was used for this step because it is “the premier American legal dictionary” (Yates, 2011, p. 195). Westlaw (n.d.) reports that it is “the most practical, comprehensive, scholarly, and authoritative law dictionary ever published” and likely the most widely cited and comprehensive law dictionary with over 55,000 entries. After filtering out non-legal terms, including general high frequency vocabulary, the resulting word list contains 684 lemmas.

# 5. Validating the CWL

We validated the Contracts Word List in terms of its reliability (related to word prevalence and specialization) and stability (related to the accuracy with which the CWL aligns with contractual language in the full population). In building the CWL, we took steps to ensure the list contains prevalent and specialized vocabulary (described in Section 4) and yields stable results (described in Section 3). Validating the extent to which we achieved these goals is beneficial not only for informing future word list creation but also for assessing the pedagogical value of our list (Arndt, 2022). In this section, we discuss our methods for validating the CWL’s reliability and stability along with our findings.

We evaluated the prevalence and specialization of lemmas in the CWL by calculating their percent coverage. The percent lexical coverage of the CWL in the CEBC was calculated to assess prevalence. The words contained in the CWL constitute $2 3 . 1 \%$ of the CEBC. This lexical coverage is quite high compared to other word lists2 and suggests that the lemmas in this list are prevalent in the domain of English business contracts. We also calculated the percent lexical coverage of the CWL for each of the six contract types in the CEBC, which are similar across strata (see Table 2), indicating that skewing due to imbalances in corpus size did not substantially influence results.

Table 2 Lexical coverage of the CWL in the six CEBC strata.   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Percent coverage of the CWL</td></tr><tr><td>Business management contracts</td><td>24.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Sales-related contracts</td><td>24.2%</td></tr><tr><td>Employment contracts</td><td>23.7%</td></tr><tr><td>Investment management contracts</td><td>25.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Leasing and loan financing contracts</td><td>21.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Business assurance contracts</td><td>24.9%</td></tr></table></body></html>

The specialization of the CWL was assessed by calculating the percent lexical coverage of lemmas in a corpus that does not claim to represent contractual language. The percent coverage of the CWL in SUBTLEXUS (Brysbaert et al., 2012), a corpus of subtitles from U.S. movies and television shows, is relatively low at $3 . 3 \%$ . The percent coverages of the CWL in the CEBC and SUBTLEXUS are shown in Table 3. Since the CWL provides very little lexical coverage of scripted speech, it appears the lemmas it contains are specialized.

Table 3 Lexical coverage of the CWL in the CEBC and SUBTLEXUS.   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Percent coverage of the CWL</td></tr><tr><td>Corpus of English Business Contracts (CEBC)</td><td>23.1%</td></tr><tr><td>SUBTLEXUS</td><td>3.3%</td></tr></table></body></html>

We evaluated the stability of the CWL through bootstrapping. Many word list creators discuss the importance of using a relatively large corpus to create a stable word list (e.g., Arndt, 2022; Nation and Sorell, 2016), and bootstrapping allowed us to assess the extent to which this goal had been achieved. Bootstrapping is a statistical technique that can help corpus linguists evaluate the extent to which a sample is accurate and reliable (Egbert and Plonsky, 2021). While comparing the CWL to the full population of American English contracts is not feasible, bootstrapping allowed us to simulate variation in word rankings in the sampling distribution (the complete set of all samples of the same size that could have been selected from the population) (see Egbert and Plonsky, 2021). We applied bootstrapping through random resampling with replacement to create 1,000 simulated versions of the corpus, each containing a random set of 2,700 texts. We calculated the adjusted frequency values for each word in each of the 1,000 simulated samples. We then calculated confidence intervals from these adjusted frequencies. Because the confidence intervals were very small values that were difficult to interpret, we converted them to upper and lower word rankings so they could be more easily interpreted. For example, the lemma rule (noun) has an adjusted frequency of 0.000249 and is ranked at 89. The lower CI is 0.000248, which is less than the adjusted frequency of performance (ranked 90). The upper CI for rule is 0.000249, which is more than the adjusted frequency of rule but less than the adjusted frequency for trust (ranked 88; adjusted frequency $= 0 . 0 0 0 2 5 2$ ). The upper word ranking for rule (noun) is therefore 89, and the lower word ranking is 90. Word rankings which vary substantially across bootstrapped results could indicate an unstable word list, while rankings with little variation indicated a more stable list.

Of the 684 words in the CWL, most word rankings did not differ across bootstrapped samples. Table 4 contains the number of lemmas that differed in word rankings by 0 (356 lemmas), by 1 (190 lemmas), by 2 (94 lemmas), by 3 (35 lemmas), and by 4 (8 lemmas). The fact that word rankings across simulated samples show very little variation suggests that the words in the CWL are stable.

Table 4 Differences in word rankings.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Range between upper and lower word rankings</td><td>Number of lemmas</td><td> Example lemmas</td></tr><tr><td> Range of 0</td><td>356</td><td>action (noun), confirm (verb), deem (verb), insurance (noun), last (adjective), necessity (noun), payment (noun)</td></tr><tr><td>Range of 1</td><td>190</td><td>charge (noun), contribution (noun), domestic (adjective), estate (noun), extent (noun), fraud (noun), secretary (noun)</td></tr><tr><td>Range of 2</td><td>94</td><td>appoint (verb), interpret (verb), liquidation (noun), mutual (adjective), sell (verb), stockholder (noun), trustee (noun)</td></tr><tr><td>Range of 3</td><td>35</td><td>attempt (verb), avoid (verb), conduct (noun), negligence (noun), partnership (noun),. responsible (adjective), revenue (noun)</td></tr><tr><td>Range of 4</td><td>8</td><td>adjust (verb), administrator (noun), assumption (noun), description (noun), escrow (noun), reserve (verb), retirement (noun), suspend (verb)</td></tr></table></body></html>

# 6. Pedagogical applications of the CWL

The CWL is a validated word list containing 684 lemmas that can be used in language classes, business or law content classes, and/or individual study. The list is available in the supplementary materials. While most word lists contain only words (as lemmas, types, or families) and occasionally parts of speech, the CWL includes additional information that can facilitate student acquisition. This section describes additional details contained in the CWL and recommendations for how they can be utilized.

The CWL contains words ranked by adjusted frequency so that highly frequent and/or dispersed lemmas are listed at the top, followed by increasingly less frequent and/or dispersed lemmas below. While the full list is 684 words, it may not be possible for all lemmas to be taught in the span of one course. Instead of selecting an arbitrary cutoff point for the list, we have retained the full list so that instructors may decide their own cutoff point (if necessary). We present each lemma in line with its adjusted frequency value so that instructors can make informed decisions about how many words they would like to teach given their and their students’ circumstances (keeping in mind that some recommend at least $1 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ of class time should be dedicated to learning each new word; McKeown et al., 1985). Normed frequencies for each word across corpus strata (business management contracts, sales-related contracts, employment contracts, investment management contracts, leasing and loan financing contracts, and business assurance contracts) are listed so that instructors can select words that are most relevant to students’ needs. Instructors may also consider selecting words that students are unlikely to have encountered in their day-to-day lives and/or studies as well as words whose definitions in daily life differ from their specialized meanings in contract language.

The word list contains parts of speech and definitions. These definitions are adapted from Black’s Law Dictionary, the leading legal dictionary used in the U.S. (Yates, 2011). We compared definitions between the second and eleventh editions of Black’s Law to determine the extent to which they differed. Those definitions with no substantial changes between Black’s Law 2nd and 11th editions were extracted directly from the 2nd edition, as these definitions are now free from copyright restrictions (Black’s Law Dictionary, 1995). For those definitions that differed substantially, we paraphrased the most recent definition from Black’s Law 11th edition (Black’s Law Dictionary, 2019). We recommend instructors and students refer to the definitions provided in the list because many words have specialized meanings in contractual language that are not always captured in general-use dictionaries. For example, one of the definitions of addition in the CWL is “A title which can be added to a person’s name to show one the following, (1) estate (e.g., gentleman), (2) rank (e.g., duke), (3) occupation (e.g., carpenter), or (4) place of residence (e.g., London)”; yet this definition is not included in Merriam-Webster (n.d.). Instead, MerriamWebster defines addition as (1) “a part added (as to a building or residential section),” (2) “anything or anyone added,” (3) “the act or process of adding,” or (4) “direct chemical combination of substances into a single product.” Utilizing the definitions provided in the CWL will therefore provide more relevant and specific explanations. However, one drawback is that these definitions contain advanced vocabulary precisely because they are relevant and specific. Instructors may therefore devote additional time to interpretating definitions. In fact, students may benefit from working together to read definitions and re-write them using more accessible language.3 Students may also benefit from examining concordance lines to derive their own definitions and/or explore the polysemous nature of certain words.

In addition to definitions, each lemma in the CWL contains three illustrative concordance lines extracted from different strata of the corpus. Reading these concordance lines can help students better understand the definition, consider how the word is used in context, and recognize emerging collocational patterns, all of which are essential aspects of learning a word (Nation, 2012). Other elements of knowing a worddsuch as pronunciation, orthography, and semantic associationsdshould also be emphasized in class (Nation, 2012).

# 7. Conclusion

The 684 words in the CWL are prevalent, specialized, and stable within the domain of American English contracts, which make them useful for legal and business professionals to learn. English L1 and L2 students may more easily read and draft contracts in a variety of business and legal sub-fields when they are familiar with such vocabulary. The full CWL is available in the supplementary materials.

Importantly, this word list is based on a corpus of American English contracts. It may therefore be most useful for BELF and LELF in American English contexts. Further research can examine whether the words in the CWL prove to be specialized and prevalent in contracts utilizing other varieties of English. Future researchers may also consider creating a word list based on prevalent multi-word units contained in contracts, since such units are integral to contractual language (e.g., LessardClouston, 2013). In addition, many BELF and LELF users work in specific sub-field (Smits, 2017), so word lists specialized to particular contract types may be beneficial.
