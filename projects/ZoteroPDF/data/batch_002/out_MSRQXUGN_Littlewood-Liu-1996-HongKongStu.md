In this book we present the major findings of what has come to be known as the LEAP (Learning Experience, Attitudes and Proficiency) Project. The project was funded by the University Grants Committee in Hong Kong. Investigations began in September 1994 and were completed in August 1996.

This chapter concentrates on describing and explaining the context in which the LEAP Project was undertaken. Two main aspects of the context will be included:

The research will be located within current international discussions of language teaching principles and methods.   
The research will be located within the specific context of education in Hong Kong.

# THE CONTEXT OF CURRENT INTERNATIONAL DISCUSSIONS OFLANGUAGE EDUCATION

In the past, discussions of language teaching principles and methods have often focused strongly on the role of the teacher and have neglected to pay attention to the learners themselves. With the advent of learner-centred, communicative approaches to language teaching, there has been an increasing emphasis on the fact that learning is a process internal to the learners themselves. A successful approach to teaching must therefore examine closely a range of learner factors which influence how learning takes place. These factors include:

the learners' previous experience in learning and using the language;   
their attitudes to the language and to learning;   
the nature of their motivation;   
their expectations of the teachers and themselves;   
their perceived needs;   
their current proficiency in specific aspects of language use:

The research described in this book represents one of the most thorough attempts to date to achieve a detailed profile of a specific group of learners in order to understand them better and to shape their future educational experiences in ways suited to their needs.

# Focusing on the learner

There is a famous German play in which Danton, one of the leaders in the French Revolution, reflects upon the unknown depths of human beings: "Every person is like a chasm; we become dizzy when we look inside'. This may also be the case when we begin to ask what we really know about the students who come to our lectures and classes. What are their true talents and where are their limits? What do they expect to do and how do they want us to help them? What are their anxieties and what are their hopes? What are their past experiences and how have these helped to form the schemata through which they interpret the events of the classroom or lecture room?

Thirty years ago, perhaps, most teachers would have regarded such questions as interesting but not essential to the job of teaching. Most of the discussion abc what went on in classrooms was teaching-oriented. (In language teaching, example, there was much vigorous controversy about the effectiveness of different methods (surveyed in, for example Larsen-Freeman, 1986, Littlewood, 1994 and Richards and Rodgers, 1987) but, in general, the learners themselves were regarded as a neutral factor in the equation. ) What would work best for one learner, it was assumed, would work best for them all. Later developments in the theory, research and practice of language teaching have demonstrated how illfounded this assumption was.

As early as the 1950s and 1960s, humanistic educators such as Carl Rogers (1969) were making the educational world aware that students are not "blank slates", on which teachers could write what they wished, but "whole persons" who bring into the classroom a complex range of personal characteristics which affect their learning/ If we are to fulfil our educational role as "facilitators of learning", we must respect these characteristics, recognise students as individuals, and adjust our courses so that they have space to be themselves. In other words we must "focus on the learner" and establish a curriculum that is not teacher-centred but learner-centred (see for example Nunan, 1988).)

The "whole person" perspective on education has exerted a strong influence in language teaching through writers such as Curran (1976) and Stevick (1980). Its messages about the central role of the learner have been reinforced by research within language learning itself. A large number of studies (surveyed for example in Ellis, 1994) have confirmed that language learners do not simply respond to initiatives from the teacher but construct their own internal representations of the language, through processes such as generalisation and transfer)/Thus learning depends on the individual's active engagement with the language)(The nature and strength of this engagement depends in turn on a wide range of learner factors (see for example Gardner, 1985, and Skehan, 1989). Some of these factors derive predominantly from the learner's unique characteristics (e.g., their aptitude and personality), others reflect also the influence of the social context (e.g., their attitudes and motivation), whilst others are molded to a considerable extent by their previous learning experiences (e.g., their current proficiency, their beliefs about learning and expectations of teaching). All of them are crucial in affecting how learners react to the educational environment that we provide for them.

The concept of the learner-centred curriculum may be interpreted in a variety of ways. A strong interpretation would be that the learner-centred curriculum should provide each student with the individual opportunities that suit his or her cognitive and affective needs at each stage of development. This version demands resources and facilities that are seldom made available except, sometimes, to support the very slowest.learners or challenge the very quickest. (Another interpretation is that we organise our classroom resources and methodology so that learners can work not only under the teacher's direction but also (individually or in groups) in ways that reflect their individual differences and preferences. This version is practicable in most settings and now forms part of the recommended approach in most advanced educational systems' (including Hong Kong; see for example Curriculum Development Institute, 1994), (A third interpretation is simply that we take into account the needs and characteristics of specific groups of learners when we design courses for them and decide what teaching methods to adopt. This interpretation is the "minimal" version of learner-centredness and describes principles of course design which have now become part of our everyday thinking (see for example Dubin and Olshtain, 1986). J

Even this minimal version of the learner-centred curriculum demands that we obtain a reliable profile of the learners for whom the courses are intended. The major purpose of the research on which the present book is based has been to obtain such a profile, with respect to English, of students who enter tertiary education in Hong Kong.

# THE SPECIFIC CONTEXT OF EDUCATION IN HONG KONG

Compared to education systems in Western Europe and the United States, the education system in Hong Kong offers relatively few choices to students. /Most follow a rigid six-year primary curriculum, taught entirely through the medium of Cantonese, the lingua-franca in Hong Kong. Following that are five years of secondary schooling, in which the mixed code (Cantonese with some English. words) or Cantonese is usually used as the medium of instruction, whereas. textbooks and examinations are in English. If one gets this far, another two years. of Sixth Form (Forms 6 and 7) education might be the passport to university.

# The curriculum orientation in Hong Kong

In the 13 years prior to entry to university, students follow an academic rationalist curriculum, where the focus is on the acquisition of knowledge, skills and values associated with academic disciplines. The social, personal, moral, aesthetic and physical development of students is often neglected because of the over-emphasis on academic knowledge and achievements in examinations. Students' progress and achievements in this system are almost solely measured by formal tests and examinations (Morris, 1996).

Class size at primary and secondary levels is 36-40, large by western standards. The teaching methodology is therefore mostly didactic and classroom-based. Theresis generally/a corresponding lack of emphasis on student inquiry, interaction and involvement, group work, and learning outside the classroom (Visiting Panel, 1982). Even though an increasing amount of attention is being paid to involving students more actively in the learning process, there are still many teacher-centred classes, where teachers spend most of the time lecturing and students occupy themselves by listening, recording the knowledge presented, or simply day-dreaming (Morris, 1996)/ Although a didactic teaching approach and regular testing may/ well have contributed to Hong Kong students' relative supremacy in Science and Mathematics, such an approach does not seem to foster their language development.)

# The language of instruction in Hong Kong

Apart from specialised academies and schools outside the mainstream of schooling, Hong Kong is one of the few places in the world where the official policy is that secondary and tertiary students are educated in the medium of a foreign/second language (English) for the entire curriculum. In reality, however, classroom instruction is in Cantonese or a mix of Cantonese and English; formal elements such as textbooks and examinations are in English.

Hong Kong secondary schools started to adopt English-medium education in the 1960's and 1970's, at a time when Hong Kong was emerging as a major trading centre and when secondary education was still mainly for the elite. This produced a small bilingual group who could deal with the outside world effectively in English. But with school places increasing rapidly in the $1 9 8 0 ^ { \circ } s ,$ this policy began to fail to meet the educational needs of most students. Today, the majority of students have trouble learning through_a_language they rarely need to use outside school.

However, because of the currency of English language education, most secondary schools still claim to be English-medium schools, even when their teachers and students have not acquired the necessary threshold levels in English to conduct or understand classes in the language. A significant amount of class time is therefore taken up with explanation in Cantonese and text translation, when page after page is painstakingly glossed in written Chinese, a code which bears little resemblance to Cantonese.

There is a general consensus in the community that students' experience of English is so impoverished that many lose whatever incentive they may have to learn the language during their day-to-day struggle with understanding their textbooks and lessons (Goldstein and Liu, 1994). None of the remedial measures implemented to improve the standards of English so far has met with success (Lai, 1991). In order to remedy this unsatisfactory situation, the Hong Kong Education Commission's Report No. 4 (1990) recommended that schools use the language of instruction most suited to their students' abilities. Since less than $30 \%$ of Form 1 students were estimated to have reached standards in English that would enable them to benefit from an English-medium education, the majority would study using Chinese for all components of the curriculum -- teaching, textbooks and examinations. This recommendation was approved by the Government, but the non-mandatory nature of the policy has allowed parental pressure and schools to effectively sabotage its pursuit.

' Cheung (1985) subsumed irregular forms of verbs, plural nouns, comparatives and words with regular inflexional suffixes under their basic forms.

Today, it is estimated that $10 \%$ of secondary schools are genuinely Englishmedium ones, while 12% use Chinese to teach all subjects, with the rest adopting the mixed code to cope with the demands of teaching and learning through a foreign/second language (Goldstein and Liu, 1995).

The use of mixed code in Hong Kong's classrooms can be understood as a natural response to an incongruous situation. But how much can the teacher translate and code-switch before learning is hindered? When the teacher's main task is to translate what is in the text and explain things in Cantonese or the mixed code, is there much scope for meaningful classroom discourse between teacher and students, let alone among students themselves?  Cheung $( 1 9 8 5 ) ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { s } }$ study of commonly used Form 1 English textbooks illustrates the magnitude of the difficulties teachers and students face: these textbooks contain more than six times the number of word types' that the majority of students actually know. There is some evidence to suggest that secondary students' grasp of basic, conceptual English words is uncertain (Yu and Atkinson, $1 9 8 8 \text{ a }$ ; McNeill, 1994 and Tao, 1994).

One of the most obvious consequences of this so-called "English-medium" education is that many students, including some of those who were surveyed and interviewed by LEAP, feel that their learning experience. at school was an impoverished one. What are the effects of such an education on their cognitive development? What are the effects of the lack of a firm foundation in English, the lack of practice and the lack of confidence on academic achievements and further studies, which depend heavily on a high level of academic proficiency in English?

As we will see in later chapters, LEAP findings provide further evidence of many students' lack of a solid foundation in English and their lack of practice and confidence in using the language.

# BACKGROUND TO THE LEAP PROJECT

Most students who enter Hong Kong's six universities have studied English for at least 13 years. Some have already had seven years of English-medium education. In many respects, therefore, their English is at an advanced level of proficiency. Yet they still lack confidence and experience difficulties in several domains. What is the nature of these difficulties and what are the compensating strengths? Students' particular combination of strengths and weaknesses poses special problems for tertiary institutions: whilst it is clear that many students require English enhancement, it is by no means clear which particular aspects of their competence should be the focus of attention.

A further source of complication is that, due to the intricacies of language education in Hong Kong and the varying circumstances in which it takes place, students' actual experience may not correspond in straightforward ways to the practices recommended by official policies. For example, as mentioned above, in many "English-medium" schools, much of the communication takes place in reality through Cantonese. Also, although the syllabuses for English have a strong "communicative" orientation, it is well-known that many students enjoy insufficient opportunities to make active use of the language, either inside or outside the classroom. So what is the reality of students' experience of learning and using English? What are their present attitudes to English and their perceptions of how learning should take place?

In these circumstances, there is a lack of reliable information about the English language experiences and proficiency of students who enter universities in Hong Kong. The LEAP Project aims to produce coherent profiles which draw as fully as possible on what we now know about the complexity of communicative competence. This information is needed as a basis for helping institutions to build upon students' competence and develop it in' ways appropriate to their needs, both in their English enhancement classes and in their specialist subject classes.

# THE OBJECTIVES|OF LEAP

In order to help remedy the uncertainties described above, the LEAP Project has gathered information which provides, for students entering university in Hong Kong, a profile of:

their previous experiences, in Forms 6 and 7, in learning and using English;   
their perceptions and attitudes with respect to English and English learning;   
their preferred ways of learning English;   
their strengths and weaknesses in using English for academic study purposes.

In the Hong Kong context, this information provides a basis for understanding more fully the extent.of-students' abilities in English, the aspects of these abilities which need to be enhanced and the ways in which this enhancement.process canbe carried forward. In a broader context, it contributes to our knowledge of how specific learning_experiences lead to_different aspects of proficiency and thus provides insights into the nature of foreign/second Ianguage learning and proficiency.

In Chapter Three, the main procedures which have helped LEAP to achieve its objectives are outlined. Chapter Two deals with the conceptual framework which has guided these procedures.

# Theoretical background

One of LEAP's main objectives was to provide a coherent profile of the English Ianguage abilities of first-year university students. An essential first step was therefore to develop a framework for analysing proficiency which would both:

be consistent with linguists' best available understanding of the components which make up language proficiency and the ways in which these components interact in language use, and provide categories and terms through which the Project team would be able to conduct a dialogue about English language proficiency (in person and through questionnaires) with teachers and students from other fields.

The first condition required thorough investigation and evaluation of current models and theories of the nature of language proficiency. The second required prolonged discussion with representatives from a wide range of disciplines.

"What does it mean to know how to use a language? (Spolsky, 1985: 180)

' Chomsky's "performance" could be Widdowson's (1989) "ability for use" or Bialystok and Sharwood-Smith's (1985) "control".

# The nature of Ianguage proficiency

The nature of language proficiency is a complex and abstract subject that has been written about and discussed very extensively. Within applied linguistics, some of the landmarks in this discussion are Chomsky's (1965) distinction between "competence" and "performance?';(Hymes's (1970) sociolinguistic concept of "communicative competence" $=$ grammatical competence $\scriptstyle +$ rules of use); and the further analyses of communicative competence of Canale and Swain (1980), Canale (1983), Bachman (1990) and Bachman and Palmer (1996), which will be described below. In the broader field of language education, Cummins' (1983) distinction between '"basic interpersonal communication skills". and "cognitive academic language proficiency" has been influential, whilst many psychologists have emphasised the information-processing skills involved. This section will describe briefly some of these approaches before outlining the integrated model adopted by LEAP. More detailed discussions of the theoretical foundations of what Widdowson (1989) calls the "fuzzy concept" of communicative competence, and the conceptual issues involved in defining it, can be found in, for example, the 1989 special issue of Applied Linguistics, Harley et al. (1990), de Jong and Verhoeven (1992) and Hyltenstam and Pienemann (1985).

Following Higgs (1984), we will use the terms "competence", "proficiency" and "ability" interchangeably.

# Models for characterising communicative competence

This section outlines three types of theoretical model which emphasise different aspects of language use and communicative competence. The first type emphasises the nature of the communicative demands which are put on interlocutors by different kinds of context; the second emphasises the different domains of competence that play a role in communication; and the third focuses on the informationprocessing skills that underlie communication.

# Communicative-demand based models

Communicativedemand based models start by exploring differences in communication demands made on learners in various settings. An example is Cummins's (1983) model of conversational and academic proficiency, which is presented in Figure 1.

![](img/098f5090d0bf8435b174c6f699efb9cd2a00670b55ca135b29bcacf3e92e4c3e.jpg)  
Figure 1 Cummins's (1983) model of conversational and academic proficiency

Cummins' model starts by outlining the context in which communication takes place. Proficiency is then characterised in terms of CALP (cognitive academic language proficiency) and BICs (basic interpersonal communication skills). Cognitively and linguistically demanding situations (such as writing essays, making summaries or participating in academic seminars) require a correspondingly high level of CALP; everyday face-to-face interactions require BICS. A student who demonstrates a high level of BICS may still be hindered (by inadequate CALP) from achieving success in educational settings. Chamot (1983) comments on our relative lack of precise information on the language demands of education and calls for a detailed description of the nature of context-reduced academic language.

Another communicative-demand based model can be found in ACTRAC (1994). Using workplace communication as its focus, this model identifies six different aspects of communication which make different demands on second language speakers: performing tasks, using technology, expressing identity, interacting in groups, interacting in organisations and interacting in the wider community. Within each of these aspects, a learner may pass through the stages of assisted, independent and (finally) collaborative communication.

# Language-competence based models

Language-competence based models seek to identify the domains of competence that a person needs in order to communicate. Two well-known examples of this kind of model are that in Canale and Swain (1980) and its later development in Canale (1983). The latter characterises communicative competence in terms of four components, which operate in an integrated way in all contexts: grammatical competence, sociolinguistic competence, discourse competence and strategic competence.

The major problem with Canale's (1983) model is that the various components cannot be easily and clearly defined and operationalised. Indeed, empirical analysis of learner performance (Harley et al., 1990) has yet to show that the components are distinguishable. A further development of this approach is Bachman's (1990) and Bachman and Palmer's (1996) models. The latter is shown in Figure 2:

![](img/edda38fb99a729b9603d358588a46925f4db05613c4e78522e7e9496e650ad30.jpg)  
Figure 2 Bachman and Palmer's (1996) model of language use

In this type of model, communicative ability depends not only on Ianguage and the ability to use it, but also on personality traits, general knowledge, etc. . For some purposes it may therefore be too comprehensive (Ingram, 1990). Furthermore, these competence based models do not hypothesise about the possible hierarchical relationships amongst the various factors and therefore do not explain the real processes of communication (de Jong and Verhoeven, 1992).

# Information-processing based models

These models (e.g., Shiffrin and Schneider, 1977; Anderson, 1983, 1985; Levelt, 1989) represent what psychologists, rather than linguists, look for when they investigate cognitive learning and communicative ability. Levelt's (1989) model in Figure 3 shows that when concepts such as controlled and automatic processing are applied to Ianguage learning, linguistic knowledge becomes distinguished from access to, or control of, that knowledge. Proficiency is therefore understood in terms of how quickly and easily one can call upon one's linguistic knowledge.

![](img/44a5588e0433cf72f820811feb794142d091efe95b45e771de181713c4ef1205.jpg)  
Figure 3 Levelt's (1989) model of information processing

The strength of information-processing models is that they aim at defining the underlying processes of language comprehension and production rather than at simply measuring products of performance. For measuring performance, however, their limitation is that they give insufficient account of how these processes may produce different results in different conditions.

# LEAP'S CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYSING LANGUAGE USE AND COMMUNICATIVE COMPETENCE

Communicative-demand based models take situations as their starting point, language-competence based models take language domains as their starting point; and information-processing based models look at the internal psychological processes involved in any communicative act. Each type of model captures important elements of the reality of communication. LEAP has therefore drawn on all three types of model in an attempt to integrate the various elements. The framework adopted by LEAP is presented in Figure 4. Here, the boxes represent the two kinds of knowledge that are involved in using and learning language; the circles represent processing strategies.

![](img/33332724725a2590330e7111b2b61bfcfae882cee0e533ef0123a82b5782e4ad.jpg)  
Figure 4 LEAP's integrated model for language use and competence

"Is it not the case that cultural or sociological criteria influence all levels of a grammar, from phonological to syntactic to pragmatic?" (Schachter, 1990: 44)

In this framework, the socio-cultural milieu is the overriding factor which influences language use; it shapes individuals as well as being shaped by them. This social world also situates learners in complex, heterogeneous communities, which present differing conditions for practising the target language outside the classroom. Within the wider language learning context provided by the socio-cultural milieu, the learner is also influenced by the language use context, i.e., the specific context in which language is used.

Individual difference variables are factors such as personality, motivation, attitude, anxiety, learning experience, age, gender and intelligence. These are affected by the specific context of language use and have an impact on the knowledge stores. For example, an examination task is a language use context which may bring about high levels of anxiety in some individuals but high levels of motivation in others.

At the centre of the model are the learner's language knowledge and the more general, non-linguistic knowledge schemata which are mobilised in communication.

.e It .\* 1

The processing strategies deal with access to, or control of, the knowledge stores. The outcomes of processing are language production and comprehension. In production, the essential processes are retrieving, formulating, articulating and evaluating, in comprehension, they are recognising and integrating the various signals and using schemata to infer or predict messages.

Similar to Coseriu's model of language and competence described in Shaw (1992), LEAP's framework suggests that we can define all aspects of communicative competence as containing universal and cultural/context-specific elements. Thus many elements of the socio-cultural milieu, individual difference variables, contexts and processing strategies are independent of the language used, because no matter what language the individual operates in, these various aspects are called upon in communication.

# IMPLEMENTATION OF LEAP'S CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

The integrated, hierarchical model described above provides the framework for LEAP's data collection and hypothesis making.

Since LEAP is primarily concerned with learning experience, atitudes and language proficiency, the four focal areas of study for the project are:

the socio-cultural milieu, the English language use context, students' language knowledge and the processes of comprehension/production.

The first two areas determine the nature of the students' experience, their perceptions and attitudes. The second two determine the level of proficiency which students have attained in different areas of competence.

With respect to the socio-cultural milieu, which is an enormous area of study, it was decided to focus primarily on the attitudes which students have acquired towards the status, learning and use of English in Hong Kong. In addition to its intrinsic importance, this information would also enable us to make interesting comparisons with previous studies (notably Pierson et al., 1980, and Pennington and Yue, 1993) and to chart the changes over time.

The language use context is characterised by the objectives of the project. LEAP's brief is to focus on first-year university students and their English learning experiences. The context is therefore primarily English use and learning in Forms 6 and 7 at secondary school and the first year in university.

By analysing the area of language knowledge, we would be led to focus on areas of language competence which are most relevant to using English for academic study, e.g., knowledge of grammar, vocabulary, and conventions for academic language use.

It is in the processes of comprehension/production that this knowledge is accessed and controlled. It was decided not to measure students' general level of proficiency, since reliable information about this is already available from the Hong Kong Examinations Authority in the form of students' results at HKASLE. Rather, it was decided to focus on specific aspects of proficiency which (in the views of teachers and students) are of particular relevance to students' academic study and/or present particular difficulties to students in Hong Kong.

Whilst recognising the importance of individual differences and non-linguistic Rnowledge schemata in all communication, we felt that these areas were subject to too much individual variation and that (in our current state of knowledge) their effects on communication were too ill-defined for us to include them in the scope of the LEAP Project.

# SOME PROBLEMS IN IMPLEMENTATION

The framework above may look clear-cut and simple. This is deceptive. Each of its components presents problems of definition which lead, in turn, to problems at the implementation level. Some of these problems will be mentioned briefly here.

# What is the context of language use?

It appears simple to identify the various communicative contexts in which students operate and to explore the communication demands which these contexts make. In reality it is more complex. The diverse nature of students' disciplines could mean that the communication demands made on them are more varied and diffuse than those made on, say, an accounting professional. What, then, are the linguistic demands of study that provide a reference for all the students?

"... what little work has been done tends to indicate major discrepancies between what actually happens and what test developers think happens." (Brindley, 1994: 83)

# What kind of communicative competence is the "norm??

Language testing has for the past twenty years been dominated by what communicative theorists think happens in communicative situations. Criteria for what testees should be able to do in a given situation are often drawn up by specialists who work with an imaginary native speaker in mind. However, when actual native speakers are tested, some of the criteria are found to be unrealistic for the majority of them, let alone for foreign language learners. For example, Fulcher (1987) demonstrates that native speakers were unable to meet the fluency criteria used in the ELT'S Interview Assessment Scale, because the criteria are not based on what happens in real conversations. Similarly, Hamilton et al. (1993) find highly differentiated performance among native speakers of different educational levels in an IELTS reading test.

"The criteria are the levels and vice versa".   
(Lantolf and Frawley, 1985: 340)

# Vhat kind of criteria should be used to measure proficiency?

Levels. of communicative-proficiency are difficult_to_define and describe... It is common to apply criteria such as very little cohesion, very fluent and fewer errors, which are vague and impressionistic. Lantolf and Frawley (1985) even go as far as saying that such criteria are circular, since there is no external standard against which learners' performance may be compared. What is more, expert judges often fail to agree on criteria and, even when they do agree, often fail to apply them consistently when assessing learners (Brindley, 1991).

# Whose criteria for judging communication should be used?

In judging to what extent communication is acceptable, and why, it is not enough to rely solely on the views of so-called "experts". Everyone, expert and non-expert alike, is engaged in communication and it is the judgements of teachers and nonteachers alike that determine the acceptability of a student's communication (Brindley, 1994). It is therefore necessary to find out how these judgements are made and what criteria are used, so that these criteria can be taken into consideration when designing assessment instruments.

In approaching these problems, the LEAP Project team not only drew on current research and theories but also engaged in intensive discussions with university teachers and students of all disciplines. Together, we attempted to arrive at a profile of language demands that was common to all areas of study. It was in relation to these demands, rather than to an, imagined native speaker, that dimensions of English language use were drawn up. These dimensions were then further refined and calibrated in consultation with non-language specialist teachers and students, so that the categories and terms should be as meaningful and realistic as possible to all concerned. This was a step towards data-based assessment criteria, i.e., criteria that are based on what actually happens as opposed to what people think happens in communicative situations (Brindley, 1994). Nonetheless, the very complexity of communication means that, though problems such as these may be reduced, they can never be completely solved.

# SUMMARY

In this chapter, we have provided a brief theoretical background to the LEAP project.  By outlining three models for characterising communicative competence, we have shown that language proficiency is only one aspect of communicative competence. We have presented LEAP's conceptual framework for analysing language use and communicative competence. This framework represents an endeavour to integrate various elements in the three types of models.

We have also described how LEAP's investigation and data gathering are informed by our integrated framework. Finally we have looked briefly at some of the problems in the implementation of not just LEAP's framework, but of theoretical frameworks and models in general.

# Methodology of the LEAP project

# PROCEDURES

The main procedures which have helped LEAP to achieve its goals are summarised in Figure I and further described below.

![](img/0189a826331872962e5bf146ef5fb7ceef3075b46ed03f6df784546098da5f2c.jpg)  
Figure 1 LEAP profile: sources of data

1. The LEAP project team reviewed other projects (smallscale and large-scale) which had addressed domains related to that of the LEAP Project. They also carried out an extensive review of theoretical and analytical frameworks relevant to the task of profiling language experience, proficiency and attitudes. The resulting integrated framework, amended as appropriate in the light of further experience, would guide subsequent investigations at every stage.

2.  The team conducted unstructured and structured interviews with first-year students. These provided initial information about their English learning experiences, methodology preferences and attitudes to English. In addition to its independent value, this information would help to guide the subsequent construction of questionnaires.

3. The team elicited the co-operation of the editors of the Young Post, who agreed to publish a questionnaire in which student-readers would provide information about their English learning experiences at school. Again, the information (based on 355 responses from. 44 schools) not only had value in its own right but also helped in the refinement of subsequent questionnaires.

Consultations were conducted with teachers to ascertain what they considered to be the most significant domains of English language use for their subject areas and how they perceived their students' proficiency in relation to the demands made upon them. These consultations helped to elaborate a framework of categories through which it would be possible to conduct a dialogue with teachers (and Iater students) from all disciplines about relevant aspects of language proficiency.

5. These categories formed the basis of a questionnaire to university teachers in which the latter were asked to state which aspects of English language use were most important for academic success in their subject and give their detailed perceptions of their students' "average" proficiency in 28 key aspects of English use. The questionnaire elicited the perceptions of 437 teachers from the full range of disciplines at CUHK and HKU. 110 of these teachers also responded to an invitation to give open-ended comments, which were further explored in a number of follow-up interviews.

6. Based on input from the procedures described above and extensive pre-testing with groups of students at CUHK and HKU, a student questionnaire was constructed in order to investigate: Students' experience in learning and using English (inside and outside school) in the two years before they entered university (including the aspects of this experience which they felt had been most useful and enjoyable). Students' preferred ways of learning English in university English classes. Students' attitudes towards a range of aspects of English, English use and English learning. Students' perceptions of the domains of English language use which were most important for academic success. Students' individual assessments of their own strengths and weaknesses in the aspects of English language use which were covered in the questionnaire to teachers. The questionnaire was completed by 2,156 students from CityU, CUHK, HKBaptistU and HKU, representing $20 \%$ of the total 1994/95 intake into Hong Kong's six universities.   
7. Since writing was perceived (by both students and teachers) as the most important domain of English use in an academic context but also as the domain in which -- with the exception of speaking -- students experienced most difficulty, it was decided to carry out a number of objective tests of students' writing and vocabulary in order to investigate: The lexical competence of students of different levels of proficiency, compared to that of English native-speaker students in Hong Kong and .elsewhere and measured against the demands of academic work. The grammatical competence exhibited by students of different levels of proficiency in their writing, again compared to that of English native-speaker . students. 110 students of various disciplines, from CUHK and HKU, took part in these tests.   
8. At an early stage, contacts were established with three universities in the PRC (one in Beijing and two in Xi'an). The student questionnaire described in paragraph 6 (with adaptation where appropriate) was completed by 330 students. One of the tests of lexical competence described in paragraph 7 was taken by 65 students.

# IDENTIFICATION OF POPULATIONS AND SAMPLES

Four groups were involved in different components of the LEAP investigations:

first-year undergraduates.at universities in Hong Kong; teachers at universities in Hong Kong, readers of the Young Post; first-year students in the People's Republic of China (PRC).

In this section we will identify in more detail these groups and their roles within the broader purposes of our research.

# First-year undergraduates at universities in Hong Kong

LEAP's main brief was to investigate the English language experience and proficiency of a specific group: students entering university in Hong Kong. The main target population was therefore first-year undergraduates at Hong Kong's universities. From this population, samples were selected as follows:

# Sample for the student survey

Stratified sampling techniques were used'to identify a representative sample of 3,000 students from four universities. 3,000 questionnaires were sent out in February and March 1995. Of these, 2,211 questionnaires were returned, representing a $7 4 \%$ response rate. 55 responses were discarded because they were incomplete. The final analysable sample was therefore 2,156, which represents $20 \%$ of the six universities' 94/95 first-year intake of 11,017. $60 \%$ of this sample were female and $40 \%$ were male. Figures 2-4 give a more detailed profile of the sample.

Figure 4 English public examinations by grades in the HK student survey sample

Unstructured_interviews were conducted with 32 first-year-students--(1994/95) across a range of disciplines at HKU. Subsequently, structured interviews were conducted with 20 first-year students (1995/96) across disciplines at_HKU and CUHK.

# Samples for the vocabulary and writing studies

A sample of 110 first-year (1995/96) volunteers across disciplines at HKU and CUHK was adopted for the vocabulary study. They included a small number of native speakers of English for purposes of comparison. 40 of these students also took part in a writing study. These students were selected on the basis of their Use of English examination grades or first language (English), so that various proficiency levels would be represented in the studies. HKU and CUHK students each made up 50% of the samples. 56% were female and 44% male. Figure 5 gives a profile of these students.

# Teachers at universities in Hong Kong

As a preparatory step for our investigations of first-year undergraduates, we wished to obtain the views of university teachers, from a wide range of disciplines, about the dimensions of English language use which are important for academic study and their perceptions of students' proficiency along these dimensions. It was decided that representative data could be obtained with the minimum of disruption by restricting the sample to teachers at HKU and CUHK. Within these institutions, all departments were sampled, except those in which little English is used in teaching and learning, e.g., Japanese, Chinese, and Statistics. 1,020 questionnaires were sent out in March 1995. Of these, 440 were returned, making a response rate of $4 3 \%$ . The final analysable sample was 437, representing $2 5 \%$ of the two universities' $^ { 1 , 7 0 0 }$ teaching staff. $5 5 \%$ of this sample were HKU teachers and $4 5 \%$ were CUHK teachers. Figures 6 and 7 give a profile of these teachers.

# Students at upper-secondary school in Hong Kong

At an early stage in the project it was decided to take the opportunity to conduct, through the Young Post, a survey of upper secondary students' experience in English, their attitudes to English and their preferred modes of English learning. This would both yield information of value in its own right and help in the refinement of the questionnaire for undergraduates, especially those sections which deal with their English learning experiences in Forms 6 and 7.

The questionnaire was published in the Young Post on January 10 and 17, 1995. Completed questionnaires were returned by 355 students from 44 schools. With respect to the total population of upper secondary school students, this sample is clearly biased towards those who are well-motivated towards English. In this respect the sample might be seen as comparable to the population targeted by the undergraduate questionnaire. Figures 8 and 9 give a profile of this sample.

# First-year undergraduates at universities in the PRC

It was decided to investigate a small sample of students from the PRC in order to obtain comparative data which would both be useful to colleagues in the PRC and help to illuminate our profile of Hong Kong students.

# Sample for the student survey

The student questionnaire, except for an irrelevant section, was administered to 340 first-year university students in the PRC in October 1995. The response rate was $100 \%$ and the final analysable sample was 330. The students come from three universities in Beijing and Xi'an'. Females comprise $3 1 \%$ and males $6 9 \%$ of the student sample. Figures 10 and 11 give a profile of this sample.

# Sample for the vocabulary study

65 English majors from two universities in Beijing and Xi'an also took part in the vocabulary study. We do not have information about their general English proficiency levels.

# DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS

In this section we describe the main instruments (questionnaires, tests and interviews) which the team used in order to obtain its data and the procedures which were used to analyse these data.

# Questionnaires

Two major questionnaire surveys were conducted as part of the LEAP Project. One questionnaire (Appendix 1) was for first-year undergraduates at foux universities in Hong Kong. The other (Appendix 3) was for university teachers at CUHK and HKU. A smaller-scale survey of upper-secondary school students was conducted through the Young Post.

# Questionnaire for first-year undergraduates

The main purposes of this questionnaire were to investigate:

students' Forms 6 and 7 learning experiences in English;   
their preferred ways of learning English at university,   
their attitudes towards the learning and use of English;   
their self-assessment of their English proficiency; and   
their judgements of which domains of English competence are most important for academic success.

This student questionnaire, except for an irrelevant section, was also administered to 340 first-year university students in the PRC. The response summaries of the Hong Kong and PRC surveys are presented in Appendices 1 and 2 respectively.

# Questionnaire for university teachers

The other questionnaire was for university teachers at HKU and CUHK. It aimed at finding out their perceptions of undergraduates' English competence and their judgements of the domains of competence most important for academic success. This questionnaire, together with its response summary, is given in Appendix 3.

# Questionnaire for "Young Post" readers

The questionnaire for university students was preceded by a questionnaire for upper secondary students administered through the Young Post on January 10 and 17, 1995 (Appendix 5). The data gained in this questionnaire survey, answered by 355 students, was used as reference for the design of the university student questionnaire, especially the part which deals with their Forms 6 and 7 English learning experiences.

# Design and data collection procedures of the teacher and student questionnaires

The teacher and student questionnaire designs were a synthesis of a literature review (e.g., Powers, 1986; Chase, 1993; Elder, 1993; Pennington, 1994) and a series of unstructured interviews with teachers and students across disciplines at HKU. Although no pilot surveys were carried out, both questionnaires went through a Iengthy process of consultation and pre-testing with over 100 HKU students and teachers. Each questionnaire was the result of at least ten drafts.

Scaling techniques such as the Likert scale and the verbal frequency scale were adopted, because these scales capture answers to survey questions quickly and in very little space. Except for the verbal frequency scale, a six-point scale with verbal anchors at both ends was adopted, with appropriate filters such as Not sure appended where necessary. Six categories are the minimum required for performing multivariate statistical analyses on the data (Green and Rao, 1970). Furthermore, pre-tests confirmed that a six-point scale was more effective than a seven-point scale in lowering respondents' tendency to choose central response options rather than extreme ones. Since responses to rating scales tend to be biased toward the largest numeric anchors and the most positive verbal anchors (Foddy, 1993), the smallest numeric anchor was attached to the most positive anchor and vice versa\*.

The proficiency assessment section of the student questionnaire was the same as that of the teacher questionnaire so that comparisons could be made. A six-point scale was used, with all categories verbally anchored and the filter Not sure attached.

The teacher survey was conducted through a questionnaire by mail. The student questionnaire was administered in February and March 1995 by teachers at the four universities, who generously gave 30 minutes of their class time for students to answer the questionnaire.

The student questionnaire was administered again in October 1995 to 50 first-year undergraduates (1995/96) from different faculties at HKU. The purpose of this was to confirm that surveying the main sample in March, when they had already studied at university for five k:onths, had not affected their responses significantly.

The questionnaire's reliability (its ability to produce consistent results when administered under similar circumstances) was further checked by statistical means (see point 6 below). In fact, both the teacher and student questionnaires have reliability coefficients () of .91 and .9 respectively, indicating that the questionnaire surveys will produce similar data when conducted under similar situations.

# Analysis of the teacher and student questionnaire data

The following statistical analyses were carried out:

' English grades in HKALE and HKASLE given by students were assigned actual scores for some ANOVA analyses.

The frequency distribution of all the questionnaire responses along the scales were examined.   
Differences. between teachers' and students' responses were checked by applying t-tests.   
Differences between Hong Kong and PRC students' responses were checked by applying t-tests.   
The effects of different variables on the responses were examined using ANOVA' and summarised by applying Duncan's pairwise comparison tests. One section of the student questionnaire (Attitudes to English) was factor analysed using Principal Factor Analysis.   
The internal consistency, i.e., the reliability -oefficients (), of all sections of both the teacher and student questionnaires were checked using the KR-20 formula.

# Vocabulary and writing assessments

Students' and teachers' responses to the questionnaire surveys enabled us to identify aspects of proficiency with which students appear to have the greatest problems. As a result it was decided to investigate students':

lexico-grammatical proficiency in writing, productive vocabulary in writing; and semi-productive vocabulary.

Following Laufer and Nation (1995)'s study of lexical richness in L2 written production, 110 L1 and L2 student volunteers were given a short version of the Vocabulary Levels Test (Appendix 6), which elicits the use of target words in given sentences. 40 students were also asked to write a composition of 300-350 words on a controversial topic (Appendix 7). To facilitate analysis, the essays were composed on a computer when possible.

The vocabulary and writing tests were conducted together. Students were first given the same essay topic with some written prompts. They then had ten minutes to brainstorm for ideas and another 40 minutes for writing individually. The 20- minute vocabulary test was taken last to make sure students did not see the composition writing as a vocabulary assessment. The students Iater received a twopage report giving them an individualised analysis of their writing. Appendix 8 gives a sample of the report.

With respect to these aspects of students' performance, the use of students' assessments, teachers' assessments and objective tests constituted a process of "triangulation', which enabled us to get a more reliable profile of students' proficiency in these domains than would have emerged from one procedure alone.

# Analysis of the vocabulary and writing assessments

Objective measures were used in the vocabulary and writing studies. In the Vocabulary Levels Test, one mark was given for each correct answer, and a percentage score was calculated for each of the three vocabulary levels. In the writing study, all essays were checked and entered into the computer. Productive vocabulary was measured by the number of word families used and the percentage of words beyond the first $2 , 0 0 0$ most frequently used word families. This was done using a computer program called VocabProfile (Laufer and Nation, 1995). Students' grammar and usage were measured by the percentage of error-free clauses; errors were analysed according to two major categories.

The effects of different proficiency groups on the various lexical and grammatical scores were checked using ANOVA and they were summarised by applying Duncan's pairwise comparison tests. The concurrent validity of the productive vocabulary measure was checked by correlating (Spearman) its scores with those of the Vocabulary Levels Test scores.

All. interviews were conducted in groups of two toz six students in a group discussion format and were audio-recorded. The unstructured interyiews were conducted at the beginning of the project in October 1994 with(32 freshmen from four faculties at HKU. No.fixed questions-were asked. Instead, students shared perceptions of their English competence, learning experiences and attitudes towards English, its use and English-speaking people. The purpose of these interviews was exploratory and the data obtained were used as reference for designing the student questionnaire.

The structured, 40-minute-group interviews were conducted in October 1995 with 20 HKU and CUHK freshmen across disciplines in five groups. Students could choose to be interviewed in either Cantonese or English; only one group chose English. These interviews aimed to probe deeper into some of the ssues raised by the results of the student questionnaire. They focused on students' English speaking and writing experiences, especially the role of teacher feedback in learning at university and in Forms 6 and 7.

# Analysis of the interview data

The structured interview data in Cantonese were first translated into English. Although the resulting data were no longer the exact verbal responses given by the students, every attempt was made to ensure that the use of terms in the translation was consistent and that the translation mirrored as closely as possible the original verbal responses. For example, one interviewer oversaw the whole response decoding and translation process, so that variations were reduced. The data were then coded and processed using key words.

# SUMMARY

In this chapter, we have given an account of LEAP's research process. This indludes the identification of samples and their roles within the broader purposes of our research, a brief description of the samples' characteristics, the various dara collection methods and procedures, as well as different types of data analysis.

# Profile of students' competence: 1

# FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS' PROFICIENCY IN ENGLISH: THE PERCEPTIONS OF TEACHERS AND STUDENTS

A major part of the brief given to LEAP was to obtain a profile of the English language proficiency of students entering universities in Hong Kong. As explained in the preceding chapters, it was decided to examine this proficiency through a variety of procedures which would provide a more fine-grained profile than a simple statement of achievement, such as the Use of English grade. In particular they would provide focused information about students' strengths and weaknesses in specific areas of English Ianguage use which are important for academic study. .

The procedures used by LEAP in pursuit of these objectives have been of two kinds:

Relatively informal, subjective procedures, in which teachers have been asked to give their assessments of students' proficiency in key areas and students have been asked to give their own assessments of themselves.   
More formal, objective procedures, in which students' vocabulary knowledge and features of their writing have been measured and described through the results of tests conducted in controlled conditions.

The present chapter will focus on the first set of procedures. It will first describe the problems and processes involved in designing the questionnaires. It will then go on to report the results of the questionnaire surveys.

# DESIGNING THE SURVEYS OF STUDENTS' PERCEIVED PROFICIENCY

Two instruments were used in order to survey students' perceived proficiency in English: the teacher questionnaire (Appendix 3) and Part B of the student questionnaire (Appendix 1). Whereas teachers' rated an average group of undergraduates, the students rated their own individual proficiency. The design of the two instruments is closely linked, so that the results can be compared and complement each other.

Please refer to Chapter Three for a description of the samples, sampling methods, data collection methods, response rates and methods of data processing and analysis. The reliability coefficients () for various sections of the teacher and student questionnaires are over .91 and .9 respectively, indicating that the questionnaires would produce consistent results when administered under similar circumstances.

# The teacher questionnaire: a multi-disciplinary collaboration

This questionnaire, which is reproduced with the response summary as Appendix 3, was completed by 437 teachers at CUHK and HKU. Its purpose was fourfold:

to elicit teachers' judgments of which aspects of English competence are most important for academic communication;   
to find out teachers' perceptions of undergraduates' English competence and of the aspects which cause them difficulty,   
to enable us to compare teachers' perceptions with those of students;   
to help us to judge teachers' expectations of students and the implicit English demands made on students in their academic work.

The questionnaire represents a synthesis of literature review (including, e-g, Bachman and Palmer, 1989; Powers, 1986; Johns, 1981; Chase, 1993; Flowerdew and Miller, 1992; Elder, 1993) and consultation with teachers. The following sections will discuss some of the problems involved in designing questionnaires to measure competence perceptions, the rationale for employing the multi-disciplinary approach adopted by LEAP, and how the design process was conducted.

# Establishing categories for assessing communicative competence

A standard approach to the design of questionnaires to investigate perceptions of proficiency is to start from a review of the literature and, on this basis, to identify various sub-skills that are involved in relevant domains of language use. These subskills then provide the categories on which the questionnaire is based. This was the approach adopted, for example, by Powers (1986) in his investigation of the academic demands related to listening skills in American universities and by Chase (1993) in her investigation of CUHK teachers' views of students' proficiency.

This approach, though it is well based on psycholinguistic theory, yields categories which are often unworkable in practice, since they would require teachers to "look into learners' minds" in order to judge whether certain cognitive operations are taking place. This is especially the case for the receptive skills of listening and reading. For example, items such as deducing the meaning of words from context, reading critically or skimming for specific information do not correspond to directly observable behaviours. Teachers must rely on their ability to infer students' strengths or difficulties from indirect evidence such as written assignments, tutorial performance, questions or body language.

A further problem with this approach is that of terminology. Technical terms such as discourse cues, skimming and scanning are familiar to language teachers, but other subject specialists cannot be assumed to work with them in the same way. At the other extreme, attempts to use layman's terms such as I can speak fluent English, I can use English to describe what I think and I can use English to describe relatively abstract ideas (as in the "Language Proficiency Perception Survey", Education Commission Report No. 6, Part 2, Consultation Document, 1995) are also unsatisfactory. When such statements are taken out of their context of everyday conversation, they are too imprecise to serve as yardsticks for measuring competence and involve too much variability according to factors such as whether there is planning time, when and to whom the individual is speaking or writing, etc.

"by virtue of his or her training, the ESL teacher is more adept than the subject specialists in assessing the more traditional features of language proficiency." (Elder, 1993: 243)

# Expert and non-expert conceptions of proficiency

There is increasing evidence (Barnwell, 1989; Hadden, 1991; Shohamy et al., 1992) to suggest that the criteria used by linguistically "naive" native speakers in judging the quality of second-language communication are different from those used by language teachers. Elder (1993) suggests, on the basis of classroom observations, that subject specialists assess proficiency in terms of whether a_task is.successfully completed, whereas language experts tend to focus more on the quality of the language which the task elicits. LEAP starts from the premise that since everyone -- experts and non-experts alike - is engaged in communication, the Ilanguage experts' conception of communicative competence is only one of many possible conceptions and that non-expert (or so called "naive") conceptions should also be taken into account. In the tertiary context, for example, it is the judgments of all subject teachers, not just English teachers, that decide students' communicative acceptability. Therefore, in designing the questionnaire, it was considered important to engage in consultation with all teachers in order to investigate how such judgments are made and what criteria are used.

"The demands imposed upon language learners by various language uses can be described more specifically in terms of the demands placed upon each of these skill aspects, and the proficiency of learners can be described more specifically by reference to their mastery of each of the skill areas." (Bialystok, 1991: 64)

The questionnaire thus represents a synthesis of what communicative theorists think happens, and what other subject specialists think happens, in academic communication. Through consultation and negotiation, we were able to achieve a more realistic picture of what competence entails in an academic context and reach agreement on a basic set of categories for describing communicative competence.

Although the skill aspects and criteria developed in this way are not "data-based' in the strict sense of being based on what actually happens (as opposed to what people think happens, Brindley, 1994) in academic communication, they could be considered as a step in this direction. The design process represents a principled way of describing and evaluating the communicative demands made in one particular academic setting and the resulting criteria could be used to inform the setting up of realistic standards for academic communication in English. The approach thus accords well with what Bialystok (1991) sees as a need for task analysis in different language use situations.

# The collaborative process

The dialogue with subject experts started with LEAP drawing up a fairly detailed taxonomy of each skill, similar to that developed by Munby (1978). These skill aspects were phrased in as little metalinguistic language as possible and then taken to twenty subject teachers in various disciplines and five language teachers. They talked about what aspects seem important to them, how and what criteria they use to make judgments about different aspects of students' proficiency and whether they would feel confident to judge their students' ability in these areas. It was found that the perceptions of language experts and non-language experts do indeed differ as suggested above:

Subject teachers tend to work much more with generalisations such as understanding and getting ideas across successfully than language teachers, whose perceptions seem more finely-tuned. That is why at least one global item has been included in each skill section. .Unlike. language experts, subject teachers tend to have little problem in distinguishing students who are in the middle group in terms of ability, even though these teachers are aware of the variability in proficiency.

The consultation process was an awareness-raising exercise for all involved. For example, several teachers said that it had alerted them to the variety of aspects involved in English proficiency. Others said that it had made them think more deeply about ways of checking students' ability, e.g., to understand lectures. In the case of teachers who admitted to having very little knowledge of their students' ability, the negotiating process stimulated their curiosity and put language awareness on their teaching agenda.

# The problem of generalised judgments of ability

The teacher survey aimed to measure teachers' perceptions of students' proficiency rather than the proficiency itself. At the design stage it was found that, though subject teachers were aware of the variability in proficiency of their students, they were nonetheless able to separate students into three broad groups: those who are at the extreme ends of the scale, i.e., very good and very poor ones, and the majority, who are in the middle. They reported that they were able to use this middle group as a reference group when completing the questionnaire. To cover cases where a teacher did not feel confident to give a rating, the questionnaire included response items such as Not sure and Not applicable.

# Proficiency assessment in the student questionnaire

In order to enable comparisons to be made between the judgments of teachers and students, the proficiency assessment part of the student questionnaire (Part B, Appendix 1) is the same as that.of the teacher questionnaire. Only slight changes to the wording were made in order to make sure that students would have no difficulty understanding the questionnaire. For example, inferences was amended to guesses or conclusions. Also, pre-testing of the student version led us to gloss certain terms in Chinese, in order to ensure full comprehension of the items.

# Reliability of self-assessment

Self-assessment has come to be used frequently in education for the promotion of learning, for encouraging learner awareness and autonomy, and for grading and placement purposes. Its use for testing and selection is often seen as inappropriate because subjective estimates are believed to be inherently unreliable. But the question of subjectivity alone does not necessarily invalidate its use. The grading of an essay or oral performance by a single rater may be subjective but not necessarily inaccurate. Furthermore, if self-assessment is used in conjunction with other methods of assessment, as is the case with LEAP, its reliability can be cross-checked.

The literature reviewed by Oskarsson (1984) points to a growing body of research evidence in language testing which suggests that learner judgments are on the whole reliable. Attempts to correlate learner' judgments with objective test scores or teacher assessments have yielded promising results. Studies such as those of LeBlanc and Painchaud (1985), Blanche (1990) and de Bot (1992) indicate that learners' self-assessment scores correlate well with standardised proficiency tests and that learners tend to estimate their abilities in much the same way as their teachers or peers do.

However, it has been pointed out that the accuracy of self-assessment often varies depending on learners' language proficiency, the types of instrument and wording used, and whether learners have been trained. Very proficient learners are reported to be extremely accurate with their own assessment (Fok, 1981 and Blanche 1990), whereas less proficient ones have a tendency to over-rate themselves (Heilenman, 1990; Davidson and Henning, 1985 and Blanche, 1990).

LEAP's self-rating scale was designed using the insights gained from previous studies. These include, for example, Bachman and Palmer's (1989) study of selfrating constructs, which suggests that the most effective queston type is that which asks about learners' perceived difficulty with various aspects of proficiency. Davidson and Henning (1985) maintain that "more or less" comparisons among items or persons (e.g., one item is "more' difficult than another) must be made available in a self-rating instrument for it to be reliable.

# RESULTS OF THE PROFICIENCY SURVEYS

In the sections that follow, we will present the results of the teachers' assessments of the average student's proficiency in different domains of language use. We will also present the results of students' self-assessments in the same domains.

It will be seen that the 2,156 first-years in this sample consistently rated themselves significantly higher than teachers rated them. This is consistent with what Milton (quoted in Milton and Tsang, 1993) found in a survey of HKUST students. There are three possible reasons for students' higher ratings:

freshmen's level of confidence may have been boosted by their success in gaining entry to university; freshmen who are weak in their English language abilities may have less knowledge and awareness on which to base their assessment; teachers may underestimate the English proficiency of their students.

The numbers on the horizontal axis are the same as those used in the student questionnaire and the scale on the vertical axis is reversed for all bar graph presentations in this chapter.

All items refer to ability to use English in class, except where outside class is specifically stated.

# Speaking: a comparison of teachers' and students' perceptions

Figure 1 shows the average rating distribution for the 10 items in this section. Teachers' and students' response patterns are remarkably similar, except that students rated themselves about one point higher on all items. A_t-test shows that teachers' and students' mean rating difference is significant $( \sqrt { \cos \alpha } = 3 . 3$ and 4.2 respectively, $p < . . 0 0 0 1 ,$

37 Express prepared ideas or arguments fluently in class   
38 Respond to comments or questions fluently in class   
39 Raise appropriate questions or comments in class   
40 Say several sentences in a row fluently in informal conversations outside class

# Which aspects of students' speech are considered best and worst?

The highest rating was given to items 31 (Communicate successfully with planning) and 37 (Express prepared ideas or arguments fluently in class). This is not surprising, as both denote performance under rehearsed conditions.

As many as $36 \%$ of students indicated that they had $\mathfrak { a }$ lot of difficulty" with unplanned speaking. (See item 32 of the response summary in Appendix 1.) If we compare unplanned (items 32, 38 and 39) with planned speech (items 31 and 37), the ratings drop by almost one point. This shows that both teachers and students consider the planning aspect crucial in performance. This is a view which finds support in L2 production research (e.g., Ellis, 1987 and Crookes, 1989).

The lowest score, i.e., almost unable, was given for the ability to use idioms and colloquial expressions correctly. The response summary in Appendix 1 shows that $6 4 \%$ have ${ \mathfrak { a } } _ { }$ lot of difficulty" with this aspect of speaking. Again, this is not surprising, given the focus on formal English in Hong Kong schools and the lack of opportunities for using English in non-school settings.

Which two features are considered most important for successful spoken academic communication?

At the end of each skill rating section, respondents were asked to choose two items which are most important for successful academic communication. As shown in Figure 2, both groups value impromptu speech. But what is striking is how differently the two groups view the ability to raise appropriate questions or comments in class. Teachers see this as the second most important skill, whereas students see it as one of the least important, ranking it in Sth place.

![](img/6f982741ef92c661f3acdcfbc78ed6ea51dbb10ece94a14b264b8c814999099e.jpg)  
Figure 2 Teachers' and students' ranking of features considered most important for successful spoken academic communication: a comparison

These results indicate that teachers across disciplines regard the ability to raise appropriate questions or comments as one of the two most important yardsticks for measuring the success of spoken academic communication. Of course, the ability to raise questions involves more than language ability: it also involves deep-rooted conceptions of learners' roles in the educational process. We may therefore also conclude that teachers and students see the role of learners very differently. Whereas teachers expect students to actively participate by raising questions and comments, students do not see the importance of their playing such an active role in the teaching and learning process.

# Are students delivering what teachers want?

As shown in Figure 2, teachers think that the ability to communicate successfully without planning and the ability to raise appropriate questions or comments in class are most important, and yet according to teachers' perceptions, students have a great deal of difficulty in these two aspects of their oral proficiency (Figure 1 shows scores of just over 3), even though students assessed themselves more favourably.

# Writing: a comparison of teachers' and students' perceptions

Figure 3 shows the average rating distribution for the seven items in this section. Teachers' and students' response patterns are again similar, except that students rated themselves about one point higher on most items. A t-test shows that teachers' and students' mean rating difference is significant $( \mathrm { m e a n } \ = \ 3 . 8 $ and 4.3 respectively, $p < . 0 0 0 1 )$

47 Develop ideas or arguments   
48 Distinguish main from supporting ideas

# Which aspects of students' writing are considered best and worst?

As in speaking, both teachers and students rated Iowest the ability to use idioms or colloquial expressions correctly. With regard to academically relevant aspects, grammar and vocabulary are major concerns, as they got the second and third lowest rating respectively. The response summary in Appendix 1 shows that $20 \%$ and $2 3 \%$ of students have $s _ { \mathfrak { a } }$ lot of difficulty" with grammar and vocabulary respectively. Despite students' problems with grammar and vocabulary, they are able, though with some difficulty, to communicate their ideas successfully. This finding is similar to that of Chase's (1993) survey of 209 CUHK teachers, who think the problems in students' writing are sentence structure and organisation. Similarly, Forms 6 and 7 English teachers, students and university teachers agreed that students' writing and grammar were particularly weak (POSTE, 1996).

Which two features are considered most important for successful written academic communication?

Figure 4 shows that there is a good degree of agreement between teachers and students on what features are most important for written academic communication. Both groups consider the ability to organise ideas coherently the most important.

![](img/490e8b3c7b2a561a1fc22a006dd225c59bbdb89cccdcd5e02dd029a684255f17.jpg)  
Figure 4 Teachers' and students' ranking of features considered most important for successful written academic communication: a comparison

This finding is consistent with what Chen and Ma (1991) reported in their study of CUHK students' written English. However, it contradicts what Mohan and Lo (1985) found in their study of Chinese students' writing in Canada. Mohan and Lo suggest that Hong Kong teachers tend to pay more attention to surface features of grammar in writing, with the result that their students are inclined to overlook the importance of overall organisation of ideas in writing.

These differing results may reflect students' changing perspectives as they make the transition from secondary school to tertiary education. Thus, at secondary school (from where Mohan and Lo's sample were drawn), students may put more emphasis on grammar and vocabulary (Sengupta, 1996); when they enter tertiary education and feel more confident in their control over formal aspects of language, they pay more attention to higher-level aspects such as coherence and organisation.

Are students delivering what teachers want?

As can be seen in Figure 3, the scores for items 46 (Organise ideas or arguments coherently) and 47 (Develop ideas or arguments), which are considered most important by teachers, are less than 4, which means students are perceived as experiencing "some" to "a Iot of difficulty" in these two crucial areas.

# Listening: a comparison of teachers' and students' perceptions

Figure 5 shows the average rating distribution for the six items in this section. The scores vary less across items and are slightly higher than those for speaking and writing. Students rated themselves higher on all items than their teachers did by at least half a point on the scale. Again, a t-test shows that teachers' and students' mean rating difference is significant $( \mathrm { m e a n } = 4 . 1$ and 4.8 respectively, ${ p < . 0 0 0 1 } )$

52 Identify the main ideas of Iectures/tutorials   
53 Identify relationships among ideas   
54 Recognise the less important information, e.g., jokes or irrelevant information   
55 Understand spoken English in informal conversations outside class

# Which aspects of students listening are considered best and worst?

Items 50 (Understand spoken English delivered at normal speed in class) and 52 (Identify the main ideas of lectures/tutorials) were given the highest ratings by both teachers and students. As shown in Figure 6, they are also considered by teachers and students'to be the two most important features for successful academic listening.

Item 54 (Recognise the less important information, e.g., jokes or irrelevant information) was rated lowest by teachers but not by students. This may indicate some sort of communication breakdown: teachers may not be differentiating between what is essential and what is a casual aside; students may be understanding but not giving the expected responses.

Which two features are considered most important for successful academic listening?

There is a lot of agreement between teachers and students, as illustrated in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Teachers' and students' ranking of features considered most important for successful academic listening: a comparison

![](img/44e26e546fa30a5264b377f26717d18d984448ced7e04f695cf3f5d017d10ce8.jpg)

Are students delivering what teachers want?

Students are generally meeting teachers' expectations, as the two items considered most important for successful academic listening were also rated highest by teachers. However, students are still perceived as having some difficulty in these areas.

# Reading: a comparison of teachers' and students' perceptions

Figure 7 shows the average rating distribution for the five items in this section. The ratings vary less across items and are slightly higher than those for speaking and writing. For the first time, students did not rate themselves higher on all items. A t-test shows that teachers' and students' mean rating difference is significant (mean $= 4 . 1$ and 4.6 respectively, $p <$ .0001).

# Which aspects of students' reading are considered best and worst?

There is almost exact agreement between teachers and students for items 57 and 61 (Understand key vocabulary or concepts in academic reading, Understand newspapers and magazines), which are considered the best aspects by teachers. The biggest mismatch lies with item 60 - teachers rated students' ability to make appropriate guesses lowest, but students did not see this as their weakest aspect. The reason for this may be that, unless they are told, students would not know whether they have drawn the appropriate inferences or not, whereas teachers would notice inappropriate inferences being made in tutorials or written tasks. It could also indicate, however, that teachers underestimate students' ability to make guesses.

![](img/55c4264bfda14e74114e0330e8f67e3a08ce7d0610b160fcc6a3f841cf2fa693.jpg)

Which two features are considered most important for successful academic reading?

Figure 8 shows there is a lot of agreement between teachers and students. However, teachers consider the ability to identify relationships among ideas more important than students do, indicating that they place more value on this higher-order skill.

# Are students delivering what teachers want?

Identifying the main ideas and relationships among ideas is considered most important for successful academic reading by teachers, but students were given a score of 4, meaning they still experience some difficulty.

# Mean ratings of the four skills

Figure 9 summarises the mean ratings of the four skills by teachers and students. Both groups rated speaking the lowest and writing the second lowest, indicating that students are experiencing more difficulty in the productive than the receptive skills. These results are consistent with those of Chase (1993), who surveyed 209 CUHK teachers and those of Hyland.(1995), who polled 1,600 undergraduates at five universitites in Hong Kong. The results also illustrate the fact that it is generally easier to understand a language than to speak and write it.

Figure 9 Teachers' and students' mean ratings of the four skills: a comparison

# Writing: the most important skill for academic success

In the questionnaires, academic success is defined as "getting an average grade in the department". Figure 10 shows that all skills are considered important by both teachers and students, although writing and reading are relatively more important than speaking and listening. Students consider that speaking is as important as listening for academic success.

![](img/47401bd190dcea524a00748279960de0383b43882665d663c211fc22c7077416.jpg)

# Students' confidence and motivation in using English

Apart from rating their students' English proficiency, teachers were also asked to rate students' confidence and motivation in using English. One third of the teachers who responded to the perception survey think students lack confidence and motivation.

# FACTORS AFFECTING TEACHERS' ASSESSMENT

# Faculty

Most differences in proficiency and confidence ratings among the faculties were not significant, except that

Education rated speaking abilities significantly higher than Social Sciences $( p < . 0 0 5 )$ , and

Education and Architecture rated students' confidence significantly higher than Arts $( 7 ) < . 0 0 5 )$

As for motivation, Education again rated students significantly higher than al other faculties $( p < . 0 0 5 )$ . Architecture rated students' motivation significantly higher than Law, Medicine, Engineering and Science $( \tt ) < . 0 5 )$

This higher rating of speaking abilities, confidence and motivation by Education might be a reflection of the Faculty's ethos: the value atached to student interaction in class and learning through group work.

# Ethnic background

Hong Kong Chinese teachers rated listening abilities significantly higher than European and American teachers $( p < . 0 0 5 )$ .This is not surprising because students are often perceived as having greater difficulty listening to speakers from outside Hong Kong whose accents are less familiar to them.

As for motivation, European, American and Australian teachers' ratings are significantly higher than those of Hong Kong Chinese teachers $( \hbar < . 0 0 5 )$ . These results support the popular belief that teachers from abroad tend to perceive Hong Kong students as having high motivation. It may also be due to the fact that English is usually the only means of communication between Hong Kong students and teachers from abroad.

# Length of teaching experience in Hong Kong

The effect of the Iength of teaching experience in Hong Kong is not significant on teachers' ratings of students' ability and motivation. It did however affect their rating of students' confidence in using English. Teachers who have less than one year's teaching experience in Hong Kong rated students' confidence significantly higher than teachers who have 10 or more years of teaching experience in Hong Kong $( p < . 0 0 5 )$ . Perhaps the latter group are those who say they have witnessed a decline in students' English language standards and confidence in recent years.

# Interviews with teachers

A summary of the interviews with teachers is included at the end of Appendix 4.

# FACTORS AFFECTING STUDENTS' SELF-ASSESSMENT

Here we will mention briefly a number of factors which have affected students' self.   
assessment of their English proficiency.

# HKASLE Use of English results

The picture given so far reveals only teachers' and students' mean ratings for each skill area. It indicates that the average student is.coping with most of the English demands of study, though with some difficulty. In this section, we will examine how well the less proficient students are coping, by comparing students' ratings with their proficiency level as measured by other tests.

Since the HKCEE, HKASLE and HKALE English examinations are well.

established for their reliability in distinguishing different proficiency levels, e.g., for placement purposes, they were used to identify students at different levels. The effects of these examination results on students' self-assessment were looked at in post hoc analyses of ANOVA (using the Duncan procedure). Each of these examination results has a significant effect on all four skill ratings $( \wp < . 0 0 0 1 )$ . The higher the examination grade, the higher the self-rating for each of the skills.

Figure 11 shows the mean ratings of each of the skill by Use of English grades. Notice that D- and E-grade students rated their speaking and writing proficiency as slightly below 4 $( 4 =$ able but with difficulty). Taking into account the possible increase of confidence after gaining entry to university, these figures could be interpreted as a indicating that the less proficient students encounter a significant degree of difficulty in using English for study.

![](img/09a77a05ebecc05d756f9728387fd3b234d1ce74b51e6d1c57b84c905b71dfa1.jpg)  
Figure 11 Mean ratings of each skill by Use of English grades

# English learning experience in Forms 6 and 7

The effect of students' overall rating of their English learning experience in Forms 6 and 7 is significant on their self-assessment of the four skills $( \wp < . 0 0 0 1 )$ .' The better the English learning experience in Forms 6 and 7, the higher the proficiency selfratings. Not only is the effect significant on their self-assessment, it is also significant on their actual examination results (see Chapter Six).

# Medium of instruction used in Forms 6 and 7 English lessons

The effect of the medium of instruction used in Forms 6 and 7 English lessons is not significant on self-ratings, except in speaking $( p < . 0 0 5 )$ : the more consistently English was used as the medium of instruction, the higher the speaking self-rating. The relatively short period involved (Forms 6 and 7), and non-coverage of the medium of instruction used in lessons other than English, might explain why this variable is not significant.

# Gender

There is reliable evidence (reported for example by Ellis, 1994; Larsen-Freeman and Long, 1991) that females tend to be better at learning a foreign or second language than males. It is therefore no surprise that they also perceive themselves to be better. Female students' mean self-ratings on all four skills are significantly higher than those of male students $( \phi < . 0 0 0 1 )$

# University

The mean self-ratings of speaking, writing and listening of HKU and CityU students are significantly higher than those of HKBaptistU and CUHK students $( 7 / < . 0 0 5 )$ . No significant differences were found for the ratings of reading.

CUHK students perceive reading and writing as significantly less important for academic success than others. This appears to confirm "hear-say" evidence that CUHK students do not need to use English very often in their study.

# Faculty

Law students' mean self-ratings on all four skills are significantly higher than those of students from all other disciplines $( \wp < . 0 0 0 1 )$

# Ethnic background

$1 2 . 6 \%$ of the 2,156 students in this survey sample have lived in the PRC. Students who have always lived in Hong Kong rated themselves significantly higher in speaking $( p < . 0 0 0 5 )$ and writing $( p < . 0 5 )$ than those from the PRC.

# SUMMARY

The findings reported in this chapter, which are based on the results of questionnaires completed by 437 teachers at CUHK and HKU, and 2,156 first-year students at CUHK, CityU, HKBaptistU and HKU, are summarised below.

1. In the perceptions of the majority of teachers and students who responded to the surveys, the average Hong Kong undergraduate has difficulty in using English for successful academic communication.   
2. Teachers' assessments of students' proficiency are significantly lower than those of the students themselves by an average of 0.5 points on a 6-point scale.   
3. The effect of students' overall rating of their English learning experience in Forms 6 and 7 is significant on their self-assessment of the four skills. The better the English learning experience, the higher the proficiency self-ratings.   
4. The effect of students' Use of English results is significant on their selfassessments. Students who got Grades D and E rated their proficiency in all four skills significantly Iower than students who had better grades.   
5. Students' abilities in receptive skills (reading and listening) were rated more highly, by both teachers and students, than their abilities in the productive Skills of speaking and writing..

Students' speaking ability was rated the lowest and their writing the second Iowest by both teachers and students.

7. Both teachers and students perceive writing as most important to academic success.   
8. Students' ability to use appropriate grammar and vocabulary in academic writing was rated lowest by both teachers and students.

9. In reading and writing, teachers and students place more value on higher. order abilities (of identifying relationships among ideas, organising and developing ideas) than on use of grammar and vocabulary.

10. CUHK students perceive reading and writing as significantly less important . for academic success than others.

11. Students appear to be capable of speaking (according to teachers, with \*some difficulty") under rehearsed conditions but are handicapped in spontaneous speaking.

12. Teachers place a higher value than students on the ability to raise questions or comments as a feature essential to successful academic communication.

13. Students whose English lessons in Forms 6 and 7 had been conducted consistently through English rated themselves higher than others in speaking.

14. HKU and CityU students rated themselves significantly higher than others; female students rated themselves higher than males; law students higher than students of other faculties.

15. Education teachers rated their students' speaking abilities, confidence and motivation significantly higher than teachers from other faculties.

16. Hong Kong Chinese teachers rated students' listening abilities significantly higher than expatriate teachers, whereas they ranked students' motivation significantly lower.

17. Teachers who have less than one year's teaching experience in Hong Kong rated students' confidence significantly higher than teachers who have ten or more years of teaching experience.

18. In open comments and interviews, teachers indicated that they see the main causes of students' English language problems as poor education at primary and secondary levels, insufficient practice opportunities in class and inadequate exposure to English outside class.

# Profile of students' competence: 2

# GRAMMATICAL AND LEXICAL PROFICIENCY

In Chapter Four we discussed the rationale, design and results of the two perception surveys of students' English competence. In this chapter, we will turn to the more formal, objective profiling procedures and examine their purpose, use and results. These were conducted by means of two tests undertaken in controlled conditions. The first of these examined students' lexical and grammatical competence in writing. The second measured students' vocabulary knowledge.

# RATIONALE FOR THE OBJECTIVE TESTS

The reasons for conducting the objective tests derive in part from factors related to the overall research design of LEAP and in part from considerations specific to writing as an aspect of students' proficiency.

# Triangulation

Within LEAP's overall research design, these objective measures fulfilled an important function, namely, that of "triangulation". This concept, which was first borrowed by researchers from land surveying, is based on the principle that we can obtain a more accurate picture of a phenomenon if we view it from more than one perspective (Allwright and Bailey, 1991). In the present instance we already had, in fact, two perspectives on students' proficiency: that of university teachers and that of the students themselves. We had every reason to believe that the views of 437 teachers would be a reliable reflection of reality and (as pointed out in Chapter Four) there is also convincing evidence of the reliability of students' own selfassessments. Nonetheless, we felt that, if we could focus on one important section of the picture by adopting a more direct, objective perspective, this would serve not only to illuminate that particular section but also - if the results of the tests were consistent with those of the questionnaires - to make the complete picture all the more convincing and reliable. Furthermore, with respect to the general phenomenon (noted earlier in Chapter Four) that the ratings given by students were about half a point higher than those given by teachers, it might help us to determine which group's ratings reflected reality most accurately.

# Writing: a problematic domain in students' English proficiency

In addition to their function within the overall research design, the tests also set out to provide more detailed information about a domain of competence which the LEAP and other surveys (see Chase, 1993; Hyland, 1995; POSTE, 1996) had revealed to be both important and problematic. The results of the LEAP perception surveys showed that both teachers and students consider writing to be the most important of the four language skills for academic success. Apart from speaking, however, writing was also the skill in which students were rated lowest in proficiency. This mismatch between perceived importance and perceived proficiency indicated a need for further exploration of its underlying causes.

Our first step was to look more closely at the aspects of writing which appeared to cause most difficulty.

# Aspects of writing proficiency

Writing skills are generally recognised to include both language-specific aspects (such as control of grammar and vocabulary) and non-language-specific aspects (such as the ability to organise and develop ideas). With respect to second/foreign language writing, Cumming (1989) refers to these respectively as \*L2 proficiency" and"writing expertise".

L2 proficiency refers to lexico-grammatical proficiency, i.e., ability to control the grammar and vocabulary of the second language. It is more language dependent than writing expertise and varies significantly according to a person's proficiency in the specific language being used. Writing expertise refers to qualities of discourse organisation, sensitivity to reader, content selection and control over the demands of writing. It is independent of the language used and can therefore be transferred from one language (e.g., the mother tongue) to another (e.g., a second language).

In his empirical studies, Cummins found that L2 proficiency and writing expertise have independent effects on the overall quality of L2 writing. These aspects are also reflected in Figure 1, which shows the model of writing proficiency which guided LEAP's investigations of writing:

![](img/b52e2d1754fc76b6791a61861982b302bfc6909b87e7d293d76f2e1abc273883.jpg)  
Figure 1: Model of writing proficiency

The two aspects in the second row of the model correspond to Cummins' "L2 proficiency" and "writing expertise". In the third row of the model, each of these aspects is further subdivided into three sub-aspects, which reflect the results both of our literature review and of our discussions with university teachers.

The resulting six sub-aspects are represented by corresponding items in the teachers' and students' questionnaires (see Appendix 1). Here items 43 - 45 explore students' linguistic ability to:

use correct grammar;   
use idioms or colloquial expressions correctly;   
use key vocabulary correctly.

Items 46 - 48 explore students' conceptual-linguistic ability to:

organise ideas or arguments coherently;   
develop ideas or arguments;   
distinguish main from supporting ideas.

We also included one item (42) which explores students' global ability in writing to:

communicate thoughts or ideas successfully.

In terms of the model in Figure 1, this item relates to the top aspect.

1 This correlation is strong considering that effective use of words is only one factor out of many which affects the overall quality of a piece of writing.

Within the overall domain of writing, the aspect which was rated lowest, by teachers and students alike in our surveys, was the ability to use idioms and colloquial expressions. We considered this to be more relevant to informal writing than to the academic uses of language which were the primary concern of LEAP. The next lowest were the ability to use correct grammar and the ability to use key vocabulary, i.e., two aspects of linguistic proficiency which perform a role in all forms of writing. They are also two aspects which are more accessible to objective analysis than, say, the ability to organise and develop ideas. We therefore decided to focus specially on these two aspects of second/foreign language writing proficiency in this part of our study.

# How important are grammar and vocabulary in writing proficiency?

The concept of "communicative competence", which was discussed in Chapter Two, has led some theorists to assign a less important role than previously to "linguistic competence" in determining overall proficiency. In the conceptions of language proficiency held by most teachers and laypersons, on the other hand, correct grammar and vocabulary play a central role. Which view is the better reflection of reality?

There is evidence from research that the teacher's and layperson's view has firm foundations. In a study by Perkins (1980), "correctness" was found to have an important effect on judgments of the overall quality of writing. He found a significant correlation of .59 between error-free clauses and holistic evaluations. Engber (1993) found the effective use of words to be a crucial quality of effective writing: his study showed a significant correlation of .57 between variety of words used and overall quality of writing'. Saville-Troike (1984) found vocabulary knowledge to be the only variable that has a significant effect on the academic achievement of L2 children in American schools.

Teachers and researchers are not alone in finding vocabulary and grammar important in L2 writing. In a survey by Leki and Carson (1994) of the perceptions of writing needs held by overseas students in two American universities, the two domains which were highlighted most frequently as needing attention were vocabulary and grammar.

Evidence from within the Hong Kong context also suggests that inadequate vocabulary knowledge and control over grammar may hinder students in their learning. In a survey commissioned by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, the 537 young people polled considered vocabulary, grammar and spoken English their major obstacles in learning English (Lee, 1995). Chase's (1993) survey of CUHK teachers revealed that grammar/sentence structure was considered a serious problem in students' writing. Similarly, Forms 6 and 7 English teachers, students and university teachers agreed that students' writing and grammar were particularly weak (POSTE, 1996).

In a study of the writing of Hong Kong university students, Allison (1995) found that the meaning and pragmatic implications of seemingly familiar words and phrases was sometimes imperfectly understood by students. One category of words and phrases which are often imperfectly understood and misused by Hong Kong learners is logical connectors such as on the other hand, in other words and furthermore (Allison and Cheung, 1991; Hayward and Wilcoxon, 1991; Milton and Tsang, 1993; Wong, 1993; and Field, 1994). In their analysis of Form 4 students' essays, Yu and Atkinson (1988a) found that lack of basic vocabulary and control over grammar were major obstacles to students' successful communication of ideas.

McNeill (1994)'s study of Form 6 students in Hong Kong found that they could recognise more than $50 \%$ of the target words tested in both spoken and written forms but could give the meaning of only about $30 \%$ of them. McNeill speculates that this discrepancy between knowledge of word forms and meaning may be a function of an English vocabulary development approach which relies primarily on mere exposure to words rather than analysis of and interaction with them. This hypothesis finds support in Bird's (1995) informal survey of 69 Hong Kong secondary school teachers of English.

Finally, Tao's (1994) study of 4,644 Hong Kong students in secondary Forms 4, 5 and 6 found that they failed to comprehend $45 \%$ of the target words tested (45 nontechnical words, $60 \%$ of which are in Nation's (1990) university word list of 836 word families). Tao reports that Hong Kong students perform poorly when compared with Papua New Guinean L2 students who have done the same test.

These considerations provided us with three persuasive reasons for focusing on students' lexical and grammatical proficiency in writing: the mismatch between the importance of writing and students' perceived proficiency; the importance of control of grammar and vocabulary as aspects of second/foreign language writing competence, and the evidence (from students' own assessments and from empirical studies) that students encounter difficulties in these aspects.

LEAP examined students' lexical and grammatical proficiency from three angles:

We analysed students' writing in order to obtain a measure of their ability to handle the lexical and grammatical systems in written English (their "lexicogrammatical proficiency").   
We analysed the vocabulary used by students in the same essays in order to obtain a measure of the range of vocabulary which they use in writing (their "productive vocabulary").   
We administered tests which would enable us to measure their knowledge of vocabulary appropriate for general and academic purposes (their "semiproductive" vocabulary).

These three aspects will be dealt with in the sections that follow.

# LEXICO-GRAMMATICAL PROFICIENCY IN WRITING

# Samples

The sample for the test of lexical and grammatical proficiency in writing consisted of 40 first-year (1995/96) students across disciplines at HKU and CUHK. Figure 2 gives a profile of the students. They included, for comparative purposes, five native speakers of English who are HKU undergraduates. The native speakers of Cantonese were selected on the basis of their Use of English examination grades, so that various proficiency levels would be represented in the study. HKU and CUHK students each made up $50 \%$ of the sample. $56 \%$ were female and $44 \%$ male.

These 40 students, together with 90 others, also took part in the vocabulary test which will be described later. Both tests were conducted together in one single $8 0 \cdot$ minute session. The motivation of the volunteers was high because they were promised a two-page report giving them an analysis of the results. (Appendix 8 gives a sample of the report.)

![](img/72a7fab530d0c4d6d75e1d28cd25cf2041518e4befe513b21fd84bbd0117f858.jpg)  
Figure 2 Faculty and Use of English grade distribution of the writing study sample

# Procedures

Students were asked to write a composition of 350 words on a controversial topic (Appendix 7). First, all students were given the same essay topic together with some written prompts to stimulate discussion. They then had ten minutes to brainstorm for ideas in small groups and another 40-50 minutes for writing individually. To facilitate analysis, the essays were composed on a computer or, in cases where this was not possible, transferred later onto a computer. Appendix 9 shows samples of the writing.

# Measures used

One of the major problems with the holistic assessment of writing is its subjective nature. As Widdowson (1989) and Hamp-Lyons (1990) show, writing expertise is not a simple construct. Even trained raters have problems with consistency. This is why the measures used for the LEAP studies were "objective' in the sense that they involved counting the occurrence of selected items (Ishikawa, 1995).

# The T-unit as a unit of measurement

One unit that has often been used to measure grammatical development in L1 and L2 is the \*T-unit", which is defined as a main clause plus any subordinate clause(s) dependent on it. For instance, it is hypothesised that the average length of the Tunits which a person uses provides a measure of language development, since it reflects an increasing ability to put more chunks of information into a sentence. In the second/foreign language context, however, an approach based on the length of T-units discriminates against writers whose stylistic preference is for short units, whilst one based on the average number of units would discriminate against writers who prefer to write long units. Several second-language studies have indeed found that it is the correctness of T-units, rather than their number or length, that is more revealing of the quality of writing. Thus, Perkins' (1980) study of various T-unit measures concludes that only those which take into account the absence of errors discriminate among more subjective, holistic evaluations.  Similarly, LarsenFreeman (1983) finds that error-free T-unit measures correlate well with different levels of spoken or written performance.

Despite its relative objectivity, the use of T-units as a research tool is not without problems (Gaies, 1980; Murray, 1988; Pery-Woodley, 1991). First, it cannot deal with multiple co-ordination within a sentence. Second, the length of the T-unit may reflect verbosity rather than lexico-grammatical proficiency. Third, structural ambiguity makes it difficult to decide which is the main and which is the subordinate clause (see for example Quirk et al., 1985: 1042-1044). This problem is amplified when it comes to analysing the writing of Iow-proficiency learners, where the errors may make it hard to determine where one unit ends and another begins.

# The clause as a unit of measurement

For the reasons stated above, the analyses of written syntactic structures in the LEAP samples were based not on the T-unit but on a shorter unit - the clause. The advantage of the clause analysis is that it takes care of multiple co-ordination, over- or under-punctuation and long units. It splits the data into small enough units, which enables a more accurate count of error-free clauses. Furthermore, it does away with the problem of the definition of a main or subordinate clause.

Based on the clause, five objective measures were adopted:

1. the percentage of error-free clauses (i.e., error-free clauses/total clauses);   
2. the percentage of error-free complex sentences (i.e., error-free complex   
sentences/total complex sentences);   
3. the number of error-free clauses per composition;   
4. the number of error-free clauses per 300 words; and   
5. the number of clauses per 300 words.

According to Ishikawa (1995), the third measure (number of error-free clauses per composition) is the second best among 24 objective measures for examining lowproficiency L2 narrative writing. The first measure (percentage of error-free clauses) is also consistent. In the LEAP study, the first three measures listed above were found to discriminate well between proficiency groups, as will be seen later in the results and discussion section.

In analysing the essays, two researchers worked together so that ambiguities could be discussed before final decisions were reached. Using the error-free clause and complex sentence definitions developed, all clause and complex sentence boundaries were marked and errors classified. (Details of the definitions are given in Appendix 10.) Each.error was counted once no matter how mmany times it appeared in an essay. "Error-free" was defined as correct with respect to vocabulary, grammar, style and to a lesser extent, discourse. Errors in connectives, spelling, punctuation and capitalisation were ignored.

# Statistical analyses

The effects of different proficiency groups on the various scores were checked using ANOVA and they were summarised by applying Duncan's pairwise comparison tests.

The L2 first-years were further differentiated by the Use of English grade they obtained just before entering university. A and B students were put together to form a large enough group for the purpose of ANOVA analyses. The five proficiency groups are therefore represented here as: native speakers (NS), A/B, C, D, and E.

# Results: analyses of students' clauses

ANOVA results in Figure 3 show that all five measures produced significant group differences. Duncan's tests reveal, however, that the most discriminating measures are number 1 in the list above (percentage of error-free clauses) and number 2 (percentage of error-free complex sentences); these are shown in columns one and two. As regards the other two "error-free" measures (shown in columns three and four), the number of error-free clauses per essay differentiates between proficiency groups better than the number of error-free clauses per 300 words.

![](img/83300d1c989ffbfeac4067ce130d4ddd57f0574141542f78bd8a9bade7abd158.jpg)  
Figure 3 Mean scores for five measures of grammar and usage

As can be seen in Figure 3, in the argumentative essays written by Grade A/B students, 57% of the clauses and 38% of the complex sentences are free from errors of vocabulary and grammar. The corresponding figures for Grade E students are 21% and 6%. The percentage differences of error-free clauses and complex sentences between the native-speaker group and the Grade A/B group are striking. Whereas $8 2 \%$ of clauses and $90 \%$ of complex sentences in native speakers' writing contained no error, only 57% and 38% were error-free in grade-A/B students' writing. Duncan's tests reveal that most between-group differences are significant, except those between A/B and C students and C and D students.

When the number of clauses per 300 words (errors ignored) was examined (measure number 5 in the list above), the results in Figure 3 show that native speakers used significantly fewer clauses than other groups did (an average of 21 vs. 28). This reflects the fact that the clauses used by native speakers were longer.

The generally high correlation between the results of.the measures used and learners' proficiency levels (as indicated by their Use of English grades) suggests that the measures themselves have a good degree of validity.

# Results: an error profile of first-year students

The errors made by students' were classified into "lexical' and "grammatical". Lexical errors are semantic errors in content words and discourse connectives. Grammatical errors are an amalgamation of clause/sentence structure, agreement and miscellaneous errors. Approximately 5% of the errors were not classified and are not included in the analysis. (Details of the system of classification are given in Appendix 11.)

Figure 4 presents the mean number and percentage of each type of classified error in the students' writing. As shown in the $4 \%$ of all errors" columns, an average of $40 \%$ of all classified errors are lexical in nature. This suggests that students' problems with vocabulary in argumentative writing are almost if not just as prevalent as their problems with grammar.

ANOVA results show that the better the overall proficiency, the fewer the errors. The mean difference in the number of grammatical errors produced by native speakers (4) and A/B students (12) is significant and suggests that even Hong Kong's most proficient students made three times as many grammatical errors as their native-speaker counterparts. E-grade students made twice as many lexical and grammatical errors as A/B-grade students.

![](img/9f68bf8fd10fc915d003ad9981e0404542aa509a1f15c08db1e0f5ec74c2972d.jpg)  
Figure 4 Mean number of different error types

From the results of this part of our study, then, we may conclude that.

Many Hong Kong students' written communication, including that of the most proficient students, may be hindered by the frequency of grammatical and lexical errors.   
About $40 \%$ of errors are lexical in nature, suggesting that Hong Kong students' grasp of the semantic categories of many content words and discourse connectives may be uncertain.

# PRODUCTIVE VOCABULARY IN WRITING

The analysis of lexico-grammatical proficiency presented in the previous section suggests that students may be hindered by inadequate semantic control over content words and connectives. In this part of the study we aimed to explore whether the size of the vocabulary used by Hong Kong students is adequate to their needs.

# Sample

The analysis of students' productive vocabulary in writing was based on the same sample of essays as the analysis of lexico-grammatical proficiency described in the previous section.

# The Lexical Frequency Profile and the "Beyond 2,o00" measure

Common measures of lexical richness include lexical variation, lexical sophistication, lexical originality and lexical density. The first three were used, for example, in Harley et al's (1990) study of the nature of language proficiency. Laufer and Nation (1995) give a detailed description and critique of all of these measures and propose a. further measure based on vocabulary size: the Lexical Frequency Profile (LFP). This was the measure adopted by LEAP.

The LFP is based on the principles that a key aspect of lexical proficiency is vocabulary size, particularly the size of productive vocabulary, and that this is reflected in the percentage of non-basic words which a student uses. One can therefore examine speech or writing samples and see what percentage of words are beyond, for instance, the 2,o00 most frequently used words in the English language. For example, among the 350 words written by an L2 learner, we may find that $89 \%$ come from the 2,000 most common words, while $1 1 \%$ come from the "Beyond $2 , 0 0 0 ^ { \circ }$ level, i.e., from a list which excludes the 2,000 most common words. The higher the "Beyond $2 , 0 0 0 ^ { \infty }$ percentage, the richer the vocabulary used and, therefore, the Iarger the person's vocabulary size (Laufer, 1995).

In order to produce the LFP for a student or group of students, the "Beyond 2,000" percentage is calculated by means of a computer program called VocabProfile, which contains the 2,000 most common words and 836 university words. A word is here defined as a "word family", i.e., a base form with its inflected and derived forms, so that for example bappy, happily, bappiness, unhappy all belong to the same word family. The program compares the words in a writer's text with those in the program to see what percentage of the words are beyond the 2,000 level.

In addition to calculating the percentage of \*Beyond 2,o00" word families, the program also calculates the number of word tokens and word families. The number of word families used is a further indication of lexical proficiency, since the higher the number, the more the variety of words used and the less the repetition.

The validity of the LFP is demonstrated by a good correlation with an independent measure of vocabulary knowledge -- the Vocabulary Levels Test (VLT), which will be described below. As for reliability, the LFP provides stable results for two pieces of writing by the same person, indicating that it is more reliable across topics than other measures (Laufer and Nation, 1995). However, it is worth noting that this reliability has only been demonstrated for essay topics of the same genre - the expository or argumentative.

# The "Beyond band 81" measure

The computer program VocabProfile can only be reliable if it is based on a large enough corpus so that words are accurately ranked according to their frequency of use. For example, different members of the same word family could belong to different frequency Ievels since some inflected and derived forms are more frequently used than others.

The validity of the LFP was therefore further checked by putting the writing samples through another analysis using'a computer program developed by Coniam (forthcoming), which is based on a different corpus -- the 167-million-word Bank of English corpus.

This program runs on similar principles to those of VocabProfile in that it compares the words in a writer's text with those in the program to see what percentage of the words are beyond, in this analysis, "frequency band $8 1 ^ { \mathrm { { \circ } } }$ . "Beyond frequency band $8 1 ^ { \because }$ contains non-basic words similar to those in the "Beyond 2,000" category.

# Procedures

For both analyses, students' essays were entered into the computer and saved in ASCH format. When a lexical item was used inappropriately, it was deleted from the text, as it could not be considered as part of the writer's productive vocabulary. However, if a learner had the semantic concept of a lexical item but had not acquired its grammatical distribution rules, the item was not deleted. For example, in many problems may be arised and sex selection is not nature, the items may be arised and nature were retained for analysis. A wrong derivative of a word was not considered an error for the the "Beyond 2,o0o' analysis, since all the derivatives forming one word family have the same frequency in VocabProfile.

The concurrent validity of the "Beyond $2 , 0 0 0 ^ { \circ }$ measure was checked by correlating (Spearman) \*Beyond 2,o00" percentages with the Vocabulary Levels Test scores.

# Results: a productive vocabulary profile of first-year students

Figure 5 gives a profile of the productive vocabulary of different groups of Hong Kong students.

![](img/6db5d1d0771477b3e43a94f9164d0cae872e24a45e313df405a7352c74c73bee.jpg)  
Figure 5 Mean scores for word families, "Beyond 2,o00" and "Beyond band 81"

ANOVA results show that students with higher overall proficiency also used significantly more "Beyond ${ 2 , 0 0 0 ^ { \circ } }$ words in writing an argumentative essay. The range is from $16 \%$ for Use of English Grade A/B students to $8 \%$ for Grade E students.  Duncan's tests further reveal that differences between groups are significant, except those between the native-speaker and A/B groups and between C and D groups.

The \*Beyond band $8 1 ^ { \mathfrak { v } }$ measure shows similar results, i.e., students with higher overall proficiency used significantly more uncommon words. -However, the measure is a little less discriminating than the "Beyond $2 , 0 0 0 ^ { \mathfrak { n } }$ measure in that it does not distinguish between proficiency groups D and E.

Figure 5 also shows the mean number of word families for every 300 word tokens. This reveals lexical richness, since the higher the number, the greater the variety of words used. The Hong Kong native-speaker students used significantly more word types (158) than A/B students (139). It appears, then, that even more proficient students lagged behind English native-speaker undergraduates in their ability to use a rich and sophisticated vocabulary. Duncan's tests indicate that differences between the native-speaker group and other groups are significant.

# Comparisons of productive vocabulary with other populations

How do these results compare to those obtained from other populations? Figure 6 shows that in general, argumentative writing, 18-year-old English native-speaker students used $19 \%$ of "Beyond 2,o0o" words, while scholars used $3 5 \%$ (Laufer, 1995). Similarly, Hong Kong English native-speaker students used $1 7 \%$ .When these figures are compared with Hong Kong L2 first-years' average performance of $1 1 \%$ , their use of vocabulary in argumentative writing appears to be limited.

![](img/d3eb30d580929153e2a076e4c8e942e0a3667d5b0422e223f2fdf28aa08f94f1.jpg)  
Figure6 "Beyond $2 , 0 0 0 ^ { \circ }$ profiles of different populations

The concurrent validity of the "Beyond $2 , 0 0 0 ^ { \circ }$ measure was examined by correlating its score with the composite score of the Vocabulary Levels Test (VLT). The Spearman correlation coefficient is .43 $( \not p < . 0 1 )$ .This shows that students who scored high on the VLT also used more non-basic vocabulary, i.e., "Beyond $2 , 0 0 0 ^ { \mathfrak { v } }$ words, even though the .43 cortelation is not high. This finding is consistent with that reported in Laufer and Nation (1995).

From the results of this part of the LEAP study, we may conclude that:

many Hong Kong students, including the most proficient students, use a comparatively restricted range of vocabulary in communicating their ideas in argumentative writing;   
Hong Kong students also use a significantly smaller range of vocabulary than native speakers with a similar educational level.

# SEMI-PRODUCTIVE VOCABULARY

The results of the study of students' productive vocabulary use suggest that many students may be operating with a knowledge of vocabulary which is inadequate or barely adequate for their needs. This aspect of students' proficiency was investigated further by means of a systematic test of vocabulary knowledge.

# Sample

The sample for this test included the same 40 students who took part in the study

2 It should be noted that the frequency levels might not necessarily bear a relationship to the "difficulty" levels of words.

already reported in this chapter. To these were added a further 70 students, selected according to similar principles, making a sample of 110 students from a range of disciplines and with a range of proficiency levels.

# The Vocabulary Levels Test (VLT)

The test of vocabulary knowledge was carried out by means of a shortened version of Laufer and Nation's (1995) Vocabulary Levels Test (VLT; see Appendix 6), which is designed to test students' vocabulary knowledge at various Ievels of word frequency.

Adapted from Nation (1990), the VLT tests students' "semi-productive" knowledge of words by eliciting the use of target words in given sentences and with initialIetter cues. Laufer (1996) refers to it as the "Levels Test of Controlled Productive Vocabulary". The word "levels" refers to levels of frequency: the higher the level, the less frequently the words are seen or heard?. The lowest level, for example, includes numbers, months, days of the week, articles and prepositions. In the LEAP study, three out of the five levels of the VLT were used, namely:

the 3,000-word level, i.e., a list extending from the 2001st most frequent word to the 3000th most frequent word;   
the 5000-word level, i.e., extending from the 4001st to the 5000th most frequent word;   
the University Word List (UWL) level, which contains a list of 836 words frequently used in university texts of various subjects, but excluding the first 2,000 most common English words.

It is estimated that one needs to know at least $6 5 \%$ Of the words at each of the three-- levels in order to read both types of texts without struggling with too many unfamiliar words (Nation, 1995).

# Procedures

The three levels of the VL'T provided a 53-item test which took about 20 minutes to complete. Each successfully completed target word was awarded one mark. Minor spelling mistakes, subject-verb and tense agreement were ignored. A student's percentage score was calculated for each of the three vocabulary levels, which were then added up to make a composite score.

# Results: A semi-productive vocabulary profile of first-year students

Figure 7 shows students' knowledge of words from three different lists. It indicates that, from a list of words ranging from the 2,o00th most common word to the 3,000th most common word (i.e., the 3rd 1,000 most frequently used words), Hong Kong first-year students knew an average of $6 4 \%$ .For students with HKASLE Grade A/B the average was $7 2 \%$ ; for students with Grade E it was $5 4 \%$

From the 5th 1,000 most frequently used words, Hong Kong first-year students knew an average of $2 9 \%$ . This covered a range from $4 2 \%$ for A/B-grade students to $2 1 \%$ for grade-E students.

From the University Word List (UWL) comprised of 836 words which occur frequently in university texts of various subjects (but excluding the first 2,000 most common English words), the average for Hong Kong students was $6 6 \%$ .This covered a range from $8 6 \%$ for A/B-grade students to $5 3 \%$ for Grade-E students.

![](img/14444bea290497d386e3aa335059736aa8453bd53bf505df5f34f3ab3a9e3200.jpg)  
Figure 7 Mean % scores at each word frequency level

3 It is thought the average   
native-speaker undergraduate should score 100.   
(Nation, 1995)

Duncan's tests show that at the 3,o00-word level, differences between the nativespeaker and other groups are significant, as also are those between A/B and E and C and E groups. At the 5,000-word level, the differences are less differentiated; only the overall differences between the native-speaker group and the Cantonesespeaking groups are significant.

At the university word level (UWL), it is interesting to see that A/B-grade students scored higher than the L1 speakers, though the mean difference is not significant. However, the mean differences between the more proficient (A/B) and less proficient groups (C, D, E) are significant.

The native-speaker group, who were expected to score $100 \%$ at all three word levels, did not do so'. This may indicate that the sample of native speakers performed below average in this test or may indicate variability of competence among L1 speakers of different educational levels, as noted by Hamilton et al. (1993).

These results confirm the results of the tests of productive vocabulary in suggesting that many Hong Kong students operate with a limited knowledge of vocabulary. Furthermore, they suggest that:

Students of all proficiency levels, except English speaking undergraduates, are likely to struggle with many unfamiliar words while reading general, nonacademic texts, since they scored less than the minimum 65% at the 5,000-word level.   
Most Hong Kong students have wider knowledge of words used in university texts. This reflects the fact that they have learned English primarily in academic contexts.   
Students who obtained Grades D and E in the HKASLE are likely to struggle with reading university as well as general, non-academic texts, since they scored below $6 5 \%$ at all three levels.   
Hong Kong students have a significantly smaller vocabulary size than native speakers with a similar educational level.

# SUMMARY

In summary, here are the main conclusions that may be drawn from the studies about students' grammatical and lexical proficiency in English:

1. Many Hong Kong students' written communication, including that of the most proficient students, may be hindered by the frequency of grammatical and lexical errors.   
2. About $40 \%$ of errors are lexical in nature, suggesting that Hong Kong students' grasp of the semantic categories of many content words and discourse connectives may be uncertain.   
3. The lexical and grammatical measures used distinguish between learners of different proficiency Ievels; students with higher overall proficiency also scored significantly higher on each of the measures. This indicates that the measures have a good degree of validity.   
4. Many Hong Kong students, including the most proficient students, use a comparatively restricted range of vocabulary in communicating their ideas in argumentative writing.   
5. Hong Kong students may also have a significantly smaller vocabulary size compared to native speakers with a similar educational level.   
6.  Students of all proficiency levels, except English speaking undergraduates, are likely to struggle with many unfamiliar words while reading general, nonacademic texts.   
7. Most Hong Kong students have wider knowledge of words used in university texts. This reflects the fact that they have learned English primarily in academic contexts.   
8. Students who obtained Grades D and E in the HKASLE are likely to struggle with reading university as well as general, non-academic texts.   
9. Teachers' ratings of students' vocabulary and grammar in the questionnaire survey results appear to be more accurate than those of students themselves. If this is so, and since teachers' ratings were an average of 0.5 points lower than those of students, we might conclude, as shown in Figure 8, that even many Agrade students have "some difficulty" with grammar and vocabulary, while many E-grade students have $\mathfrak { a }$ lot of difficulty".   
10. These results confirm the view that Hong Kong students need more

opportunities for effective learning of vocabulary and grammar.

# Profile of students' English learning experience

In the book so far we have presented a detailed profile of first-year students' English proficiency, as revealed by the various procedures adopted by LEAP. Students' proficiency in English is of course a major factor which influences how they use and learn the language when they come into tertiary education. It is not, however, the only factor. Their use and learning of English are influenced also by a range of other perceptions and attitudes which have been formed in the course of their previous experience. In order to form as complete a picture as possible of the students who enter universities in Hong Kong, it is important to investigate also these experiences, perceptions and attitudes.

It is generally recognised that a students' previous experience of using and learning a language affect not only their present level of proficiency but also their "receptivity" (Allwright and Bailey, 1991) to various types of teaching. Through their previous experience, students have constructed perceptions of learning and teaching which are often deep-rooted and can exert strong influences (both positive and negative) on their attitudes and responses to further attempts to organise their learning.

In the present instance it was therefore important to find out as much as possible about the learning experiences which students have had immediately prior to entering university, i.e., in Forms 6 and 7 of secondary school. In this chapter we will report what we have learnt about these experiences on the basis of students' responses to Part C of the questionnaire (Appendix 1), which was completed by 2,156 first-year students at CUHK, CityU, HKBaptistU and HKU.

In the questionnaire we investigated two complementary aspects of students' English learning experience before entering university:

their English learning experience in class in Forms 6 and 7;   
their English learning experience outside class during the same period.

In order to provide a fuller picture, we will also report here the findings of the Young Post readers' questionnaire (Appendix 5, Section B), which was used as a reference for the design of the university student questionnaire. We should note, however, that the results of the university student survey and those of the Young Post survey are not strictly comparable, since the two surveys employed different questionnaires and measuring scales. (For a more in-depth analysis and interpretation of the results of the Young Post survey, see our article in New Horizons in Education, No. 37, 1996.)

# OVERALL ENGLISH LEARNING EXPERIENCE IN FORMS 6 AND 7

Students rated their overall English learning experience on a 6-point Likert scale using five descriptive statements. The reliability coefficient () of this section of the questionnaire was a high .91 and the average reliability coefficient $( \alpha )$ of other sections of the questionnaire was .85, indicating that the questionnaire would produce consistent results when administered again under similar circumstances.

Figure 1 shows the mean rating of each of the five statements. Students' weak agreement (average 3.5) with the positive statements indicate that their experience is neither very useful nor enjoyable. "I learned a lot of English in Forms 6 and 7" had the lowest rating (3.3). This is followed by $^ { \mathrm { { s t } } } \mathrm { { I } }$ liked my English lessons" (3.5) and "I had a good English teacher" (3.6).

The numbers on the horizontal axis are the same as those in the questionnaire and the scale on the vertical axis is reversed for all bar graph presentations in this chapter.

95 I had a good English teacher in Forms 6 and 7.   
96 I learned a lot of English in Forms 6 and 7.   
97 I understood the learning purpose of most class activities.   
98 My English lessons in Forms 6 and 7 improved my ability to communicate in English.

# Effects of English learning experience on attitudes and examination results

The effect of students' overall rating of their English learning experience in Forms 6 and 7 is significant on their affective $( \wp < \ . 0 0 0 1 )$ , socio-political $( p < ~ . 0 5 )$ and pragmatic $( \phi < . 0 0 5 )$ attitudes to English. (See Chapter Seven for a definition of these terms.). The better the English learning experience, the more positive the affective attitudes and the more positive the socio-political attitudes. Students who had an average English learning experience were found to have the most positive pragmatic attitudes to English. One interpretation of this finding is that students who had an excellent experience might like English so much that their pragmatic attitudes are over-shadowed by affective attitudes. Similarly, students who had an unpleasant experience might dislike English so much so that they attach less importance to its pragmatic value.

The effect of learning experience is also significant on students' HKALE and HKASLE English results $( \wp < . 0 0 0 1 )$ . The better the English learning experience, the higher the examination scores. (See Chapter Four for the effect of students' learning experience on their proficiency self-ratings.)

# MEDIUM OF INSTRUCTION IN FORMS 6 AND 7 ENGLISH LESSONS

One of the most interesting aspects of students' English learning experience is the medium of instruction they received at secondary school, since this gives an indication of the quantity (though not quality) of English input students have had before entering university. Because it was not feasible in the university student survey to find out the medium of instruction used in every subject, only English lessons in Forms 6 and 7 were targeted.

The first pie chart in Figure 2 shows that only $2 6 \%$ of the 2,156 freshmen surveyed had English as their sole medium of instruction in English lessons in Forms 6 and 7, while $1 1 \%$ had mostly Cantonese instruction. Almost half of the students surveyed $( 4 5 \% )$ had "mixed code" or mostly Cantonese instruction.

![](img/545e1c30eed9a924c6d40b964b474e793d6c10a19791c30d3cab893803bebdc0.jpg)  
Figure 2 Medium of instruction used in English and other subject areas

These results demonstrate that English use is generally low in English lessons in Forms 6 and 7. We might expect its use to be lower still in other subject areas. Indeed, this inference is borne out by the results of the Young Post readers' survey shown in the second pie chart in Figure 2. In this survey, which asked about the medium of instruction in all subjects, $60 \%$ of students indicated that they had "mixed code" or mostly Cantonese instruction at school. Classroom observation conducted as part of a UGC-commissioned study also revealed that most Forms 6 and 7 classes were not conducted in English (POSTE, 1996).

# Effects of medium of instruction on confidence, proficiency and learning experience

ANOVA analysis reveals that the effect of the extent of English use (as a medium of instruction) is significant on students' overall confidence in speaking $( p < . 0 0 5 )$ but not in other skills. The more English was used as a medium of instruction, the higher the speaking self-rating. If we examine students' performance in public examinations, however, we find that their overall English proficiency is affected by the extent 'of English use $( \pmb { \mathscr { p } } < . 0 0 0 1 )$ . The more English was used as a medium of instruction, the higher the HKALE and HKASLE English scores.

Furthermore, the effect of the extent of English use is significant on students' overall rating of their English learning experience in Forms 6 and 7 $( \wp < . 0 0 5 )$ . The more English was used as a medium of instruction, the more positively the English learning experience was rated. Conversely, students who had "mostly Cantonese" as a medium of instruction adopt a significantly negative attitude toward use of English as medium of instruction in secondary school $( p < . 0 5 )$

# FREQUENCY OF ENGLISH LESSON ACTIVITIES IN FORMS 6 AND 7

# The traditional-communicative continuum

In this part of the university student questionnaire, students were asked to indicate on a 5-point verbal frequency scale how often they participated in 12 English learning activities.

At least one third of the learning activities listed under Figure 3 are communicative-oriented activities. They are items 80, 81, 84 and 87 (group discussion, pair work, role-play/drama, and watching videos). This is not to say that the rest of the items, such as grammar exercises and listening comprehension exercises, are necessarily non-communicative. They can be communicative in that they generate creative, authentic or semi-authentic language use by students. However, in Hong Kong secondary schools, these learning activities are typically used as preparation or drill for the HKASL Use of English (UE) examination rather than as means by which students are actively engaged in creative or analytic manipulation of English (see for example, Lai, 1994).

# The university student survey

As shown in Figure 3, item 85 (Listening to teacher), is the most frequent activity, followed by items 78 (Writing essays), 82 (Reading comprehension), 83 (Listening comprehension) and 80 (Group discussion). With the exception of group discussion, the more communicative-orientated activities or modes of Iearning (pair work, role-play/drama, and watching videos) are among the least frequent activities.

![](img/e549dee83304cea36874757af5cf656d04cac27d0d6b0c609817bb06e01ae9d5.jpg)

83 Listening comprehension   
84 Watching videos   
85 Listening to teacher   
86 Answering teacher's questions   
87 Pair work

The fact that students listened to their English teacher most often in class should not come as a surprise. However, the high proportion of teacher talk must have the effect of reducing significantly the opportunities for student talk. These opportunities are further reduced by the high frequency of essay writing, reading and listening comprehension, which are key components in the UE examination.

The relative frequency of one speaking activity (Group discussion) is likely to be a backwash of the introduction of a speaking component into the Use of English examination in 1994 (Andrews and Fullilove, 1993). However, another speaking activity (Role-play/drama) is the least frequent of all activities and pair work as a mode of learning is only "sometimes" adopted.

# The Young Post readers' survey

The university student survey results are backed up by those of the Young Post survey. In the Young Post survey, "listening to teacher" is also the most frequent class activity, followed by group discussion, reading and grammar exercises, and other examination practice activities such as listening to cassettes and writing essays. Peer correction, drama/role-play, project work, pronunciation practice and watching videos are the least frequent learning activities in upper secondary English classes (Forms 4-7). In Lai's (1994) study of interaction patterns in Form 4 English classes, this kind of "chalk-and-talk" teaching style is also common.

# ENGLISH LESSON ACTIVITY PREFERENCES IN FORMS 6 AND 7

The university student survey

![](img/80f7b9c4f804e68f420635ee8e5182594e31740f1e2cf09c72f4c75718b436b4.jpg)

83 Listening comprehension   
84 Watching videos   
85 Listening to teacher   
86 Answering teacher's questions   
87 Pair work

Figure 4 reveals students' average liking for the same 12 activities (as shown in Figure 3) in class on a 6-point Likert-type scale. We can see that students exhibit a mild liking for English lesson activities. No particularly strong liking is expressed for any of the activities, except group discussion and watching videos, which have an average rating of 4.

Students like group discussion (a frequent activity) and watching videos (a rare activity) most. The activities they enjoy least are grammar exercises, roleplay/drama (the least frequent activity) and answering teachers' questions.

# Reasons for activity preferences

Figure 5 shows the average ratings of five possible reasons for students' activity preferences on a 6-point scale.

![](img/90219df25f311db58b618c174250ccd7a05d815947a374f4b1d7a67edc437c1c.jpg)  
Figure 5 Reasons for liking certain English lesson activities

90 Ilearnedalot.   
91 The activities were challenging.'   
92 The activities gave me the chance to speak and interact with my classmates.   
93 The activities were useful for examinations.

Of the five possible reasons, the two which drew the strongest degree of agreement are items 92 (The activities gave me the chance to speak and interact with my classmates) and 93 (The activities were useful for examinations). Perhaps one of the reasons for the unpopularity of role-play/drama (apart from the fact that it is the least frequent activity) is that it is not perceived as useful for examinations.

# The Young Post readers' survey

The results of the Young Post readers' survey mirror those of the university student survey with regard to students' liking for watching videos and group discussion. However, unlike university first-years, Young Post readers are very keen on drama/roie-play, songs and games, which they ranked as the second most enjoyable after watching videos.

This difference could be attributed to the category "drama/role-play, songs and games" used in the Young Post readers' survey. With three different activities in the same category, it is difficult to ascertain which was referred to by the students. This was the reason for splitting up the category and adopting "drama/role-play" for the later university student survey.

Taken together, the results of the two surveys suggest that students liked songs and games a lot better than drama/role-play. This is understandable, given the difficulty of assuming a different identity and performing it in a drama/role-play situation in a foreign language.

# Effects of the frequency of English Iesson activities

It was hypothesised that a) the frequency of in-class activities, b) students' liking for them and c) their perceived usefulness (in improving students' English) are factors which affect students' confidence (as indicated in self-assessments) and proficiency (as indicated in public examination results). ANOVA analyses were therefore used to tease out which of the three factors is significant in determining students' confidence and proficiency.

As can be seen in the following paragraphs, the effect of students' degree of liking for activities is not significant on either their confidence or examination results. However, the effect of the frequency of production activities (speaking and writing) is significant.

![](img/32e44e4d9c3671665c204a2dff5b93a1a1a540f50d871a57ac0032e03b9ccd84.jpg)

With regard to speaking activities (group discussion, role-play, drama, pair work and answering teacher's questions), frequency is the only factor which has a significant effect:

on students' self-ratings of the ability to communicate successfully without planning and raise questions and comments in class (p< .o0o1) - the two features considered most important for successful spoken academic communication by university teachers and students. The more frequent these speaking activities, the higher the self-ratings;

on HKALE and HKASLE overall English results $( \sharp < . 0 0 0 1 )$ . The more frequent these speaking activities, the higher the examination scores.

# Writing

With regard to more traditional activities related to writing (writing essays, error correction, grammar and vocabulary exercises), frequency and perceived English improvement have significant interaction effects $( p < . 0 0 5 )$ on students' confidence. The higher the frequency and perceived English improvement, the higher the students' self-ratings of overall writing ability. However, only the effect of frequency is significant:

on HKALE and HKASLE overall English results $( p < . 0 0 0 1 )$ . The more frequent the writing-related activities, the higher the examination scores.

Unfortunately, students did not do these activities often in Forms 6 and 7. As seen in Figure 3, students often wrote essays, but they only had error correction and grammar exercises sometimes and vocabulary exercises less than sometimes.

# Listening and reading

The frequency and perceived English improvement of listening and reading activities have significant interaction effects (p< .005) on students' self-ratings on overall listening and reading ability.

# FREQUENCY OF OUTSIDE-CLASS ENGLISH ACTIVITIES IN F 6 AND 7

The university student survey

Figure 6 shows the mean frequencies of 10 out-of-class English activities students reported doing when in Forms 6 and 7.

![](img/18df6ed262a2c404f992970f510035f85ba76288abcbf6482d04de7a1b915dd5.jpg)

104 Speak with tourists   
105 Speak with friends, classmates, etc.   
106 Take lessons outside school   
107 Keep a vocabulary notebook   
108 Writeto friends

![](img/1d480b9f7b8d16aa20a3dd895dc69bb6a0c087d189ee7a7ef63b8142f4df38cc.jpg)

We can see that students did not often undertake any of the activities. Only a few of the activities were sometimes done outside class. They were "watch TV programmes", "listen to tapes", "read newspapers and books". Speaking English was an infrequent-activity: students rarely spoke with tourists but occasionally. spoke with friends or.classmates. "Listen to the radio" and "writing to friends" were also relatively infrequent.

The findings echo those of Yu and Atkinson's (1988b) survey of 118 Form 4 students, who hardly used English at all outside class and were rarely exposed to English television or newspaper. LEAP and other surveys confirm the commonly held belief that the amount of English students use outside class in daily life is negligible.

# The Young Post readers' survey

The results of the Young Post readers' survey are similar to those of the university student survey with regard to the most frequent activities (read newspapers, watch TV programs. or movies, listen to songs) and the least frequent activities (Speak with tourists). However, unlike university first-years, Young Post readers appear more keen on "keeping a vocabulary notebook" and "writing to friends", since they ranked these activities as the fourth and sixth most frequent. This may reflect the self-selection bias towards more motivated students in the Young Post survey.

# OUTSIDE-CLASS ENGLISH ACTIVITY PREFERENCES IN F 6 AND 7

The university student survey

Figure 7 shows students' average liking for the same 10 outside-class English activities (as shown in Figure 6).

Figure 7. Outside-class English activity preferences in Forms 6 and 7

![](img/9289784eee95aad1b206c453b27f5e9276501f4d6209171d8c2900b75d3a3a97.jpg)

99 Watch TV programs   
100 Listen to the radio   
101 Listen to tapes (e.g., exam. practice tapes, songs)   
102 Read newspapers   
103 Read books   
104 Speak with tourists   
105 Speak with friends, classmates, etc.   
106 Take lessons outside school   
107 Keep a vocabulary notebook   
108 Write to friends

Students enjoyed watching TV (the most frequent yet only "sometimes' done outside-class activity) and speaking with friends or classmates most when they were in Forms 6 and 7. The activity they liked least was taking English lessons outside school.

In the Young Post readers' survey, students were not asked which outside-class English activities they enjoyed most.

# Effects of the frequency and degree of liking of outside-class activities

It was hypothesised that a) the frequency of outside-class activities, b) students' Iiking for them and c) their perceived usefulness (in improving students' English) are factors which might affect students' confidence (as indicated in selfassessments) and proficiency (as indicated in public examination results). ANOVA analyses were therefore used to tease out which of the three factors is significant in determining students' confidence and proficiency.

The effect of the frequency of activities is significant on all skill self-ratings (speaking, writing, listening and speaking, ${ p < . 0 0 0 1 } )$ . The more often students practised English outside class, the higher they rated themselves on all four skills.

The effect of the frequency of activities is significant on HKALE but not on HKASLE English results. The more frequent the outside class activities, the better the HKALE English.scores. (Only 1/3 of the 2,156 students surveyed took the HKALE in 1993. The rest took the HKASLE in 1994.) Perhaps the overall frequency of outside-class activities was too low for it to have a sizeable effect on actual examination results.

The effect of students' degree of liking of outside-class activities is significant on their skill-ratings, but only in interaction with perceived usefulness $( \tt ) < . 0 0 5 )$ This is in contrast with in-class activities where, as we saw earlier, degree of liking has no significant effect.on either self-ratings or examination results.

# SUMMARY

Figure 8 represents a summary of the main results of the university student survey and the Young Post readers' survey.

![](img/ecee26e96358365422c396d9a9651ab3e64f5aa91faa2d99825d82ccd5c58e9e.jpg)  
Figure 8 Summary of in-class and outside-class activity frequency and preferences

Students who enter universities-in-Hong Kong-have-had limited experience of using spoken English in_active, questioning roles both in and outside class. When they were in Forms 6 and 7, they spent most of their English class time listening to the teacher.

2.  Students' passive speech role in secondary school contrasts sharply with their preference for an active speech role, they liked group discussion most in Forms 6 and 7 English classes.   
3. Since watching videos (presumably TV programmes/movies) was also one of the most enjoyable in-class activities, students sometimes did the same outside class too.   
4. Not only was watching TV programmes the most frequent outside-class activity, it was also the most enjoyable. But students did not watch them frequently.   
5. The strongest reasons for liking certain activities in Forms 6 and 7 are \*they gave me the chance to speak and interact with my classmates" and \*they were useful for examinations".   
6. Students liked roleplay, drama, grammar exercises and answering teacher's questions least when they were in Forms 6 and 7.   
7. The frequency of speaking practice opportunities alone is vital to students' confidence and overall proficiency: the more frequent the speaking activities in Forms 6 and 7, the higher the speaking self-assessment and the better the. HKALE and HKASLE English results.   
8. The more frequent the writing-related activities (writing essays, error correction, grammar and vocabulary exercises) in Forms 6 and 7, the' better the HKALE and HKASLE English scores. However, with the exception of essay writing, students did not do these activities often.   
9. The more often students did English activities outside class in Forms 6 and 7, the higher their self-ratings on all four skills and the better their HKALE English scores.   
10. The more English was used by the English teacher in Forms 6 and 7, the higher the students' speaking self-rating and HKASLE and HKALE English scores. Unfortunately, only $2 6 \%$ of the 2,156 freshmen surveyed reported having English as their sole medium of instruction in English lessons in Forms 6 and 7.   
11. The more English was used as a medium, the better the English learning experience in Forms 6 and 7.   
12. The better the English learning experience in Forms 6 and 7, the higher the HKALE and HKASLE English scores and all four skill self-ratings. Unfortunately, most students rated their experience only as fair (3.5 out of 6).

# Profile of students' attitudes to English learning and use

The previous chapter reported on students' experience of using and learning English in the two years prior to entering university. It was pointed out that this experience was one of the crucial factors determining not only students' level of English proficiency (as profiled in Chapters Four and Five) but also the attitudes that they bring to their present and future learning opportunities. This chapter will focus directly on these attitudes. It will complete the LEAP profile by setting out what our survey has revealed about:

the' learning activities and teaching methods which students prefer in university English courses.   
students' attitudes towards English and its use.

These results are based on the responses to Part A of the LEAP questionnaire (Appendix 1), which was completed by 2,156 first-year students at CUHK, CityU, HKBaptistU and HKU.

When appropriate, we also report here the findings of the Young Post readers' questionnaire on students' attitudes (Appendix 5, Section C). However, since the two surveys used different questionnaires and scales, the results of the university student survey and those of the Young Post readers' survey are not strictly comparable. (For a more in-depth analysis and interpretation of the results of the Young Post survey, see our article in New Horizons in Education, No. 37, 1996.)

PREFERRED LEARNING ACTIVITIES AND TEACHING METHODS ATUNIVERSITY

# Procedures and rationale

Students' preferred learning activities and teaching methods were investigated by means of their responses to twelve statements on a 6-point Likert scale. Each of the twelve statements (which are shown in the legend of Figure 1) taps the degree of students' preference for a particular aspect of learning or teaching.

The reliability coefficient () of this section of the questionnaire is .78, indicating that it would produce consistent results when administered again under similar circumstances.

Taken together, the statements describe what might be termed the "weak" version (Howatt, 1984) of the communicative approach to language teaching and learning. This version synthesises traditional and communicative principles. For example, although it affirms the central importance of fluency in language use, it does not neglect the need for accuracy; although it does not adopt negative attitudes towards errors, it recognises the need to treat them, e.g., through correction and controlled practice.

This version of the communicative approach is widely adopted by teachers and underlies the recommendations in many handbooks used in teacher education (e.g., Harmer, 1983; Littlewood, 1981). Furthermore, research into learner beliefs about second language teaching and learning indicate that learners too tend to incorporate characteristics from both parts of the traditional-communicative continuum $( \mathrm { O r } , ~ 1 9 9 4 )$ and are often less communicative-oriented than those of teachers $( \mathbb { N } \mathrm { u n a n } , 1 9 8 8 )$ . It is therefore essential that a survey instrument should incorporate attributes from both sides of the continuum.

The numbers on the horizontal axis are the same as those in the questionnaire and the scale on the vertical axis is reversed for all bar graph presentations in this chapter.

# Results

# Overview

The responses, summarised in Figure ${ \mathsf { 1 } } ,$ show with only minor variations that students have a consistent preference (though not a strong one) for a learningcentred approach which combines both traditional and communicative principles.

Figure 1 Mean ratings of methodology preferences in university English classes

I like a university English class in which:

1 learning focuses on the importance of correct grammar, vocabulary and pronunciatiol   
2 learning focuses on the importance of fluency.   
3 Students do most of the talking.   
4 a lot of attention is paid to listening and speaking.   
5 a lot of attention is paid to using everyday language.   
6 materials contain a lot of communication exercises, e.g., role-plays, discussions, etc.   
7 a lot of materials from real life (e.g., TV, radio) are used.   
8 teacher helps students to find out for themselves the language they   
need to get things done.   
9 teacher corrects most of the mistakes that students make.   
10 teacher explains the learning purpose of class activities.   
11 there is a lot of teacher guidance and explanation.   
12 there is a lot of group and pair work.

I like a university English class in which:

Figure 2 Rank order of methodology preferences by $\%$ of agreement

Because the bar graph in Figure 1 cannot capture the slight differences in the responses, the same data is presented in a different format in Figure 2. Here, the statements are ranked by the percentage of agreement they solicited. The percentage was obtained by adding up the three points on the "agree" side of the 6-point scale.

# Fluency and fluency-related activities

Statements such as $s _ { 2 }$ lot of attention is paid to listening and speaking" and "learning focuses on the importance of fluency" drew the biggest percentage of agreement (83 and $8 2 \%$ respectively). Students also like to do most of the talking in class and to engage in communication exercises. These results indicate that students adopt a very positive attitude towards fluency development, especially through listening and speaking, group and pair work, and discussions.

Apart from indicating bow students like to learn English, the results also give an indication of what kind of English students wish to focus on. $80 \%$ indicated that they like a class in which "a lot of attention is paid to using everyday language". This suggests that students wish to develop their fluency in using everyday language, perhaps because they have so far used predominantly academic language.

These findings, when interpreted together with those of students' Forms 6 and 7 English learning experience reported in the last chapter, point to the effects of students' previous experience on their methodology orientation. In the last chapter, we saw that students play a largely passive listening role in English class, yet they demonstrate a great deal of enthusiasm for group talk. Furthermore, the. frequency of speaking practice is shown to be the only factor affecting their confidence and proficiency. It is no coincidence that students favour a methodology that promotes fluency in speech when they enter university.

The statement\~which denotes the importance of accuracy, "learning focuses on the importance of correct grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation", drew a relatively smaller percentage of agreement $( 7 1 \% )$ than the statement on fluency $( 8 2 \% )$ and those on fluency-related activities. This suggests that students attach more importance to fluency than correct grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation in university English classes. This is understandable because they had few opportunities (as shown in the last chapter) for fluency development before entering university.

However, their desire for fluency-related activities is accompanied by a strong desire to have their mistakes corrected by the teacher (presumably in speech as well as writing). The statement, "teacher corrects most of the mistakes that students make", was agreed with by $7 7 \%$ of the students. This is $6 \%$ more than the statement on the importance of accuracy and might indicate that students prefer to improve their accuracy through error correction by the teacher rather than through other structured forms of accuracy development. What seems certain is that students have not forsaken accuracy and they want their mistakes corrected.

Again, when these findings are interpreted together with those of students' Forms 6 and 7 English learning experience reported in the last chapter, we find that they might be a function their experience. For instance, error correction is not a frequent activity in Forms 6 and 7 English classes; neither are grammar exercises. Although students like grammar exercises least in Forms 6 and 7, they desire accuracy development through teacher feedback or error correction at university. This preference for error correction is similar to what Leki (1991) found with students in university writing classes.

# Role of the teacher

The extent of agreement is weakest for statements which signify a relatively stronger teacher role. These include "there is a lot of teacher guidance and explanation" $( 6 6 \% )$ , "teacher explains the learning purpose of class activities" $( 7 4 \% )$ and "teacher helps students to find out for themselves the language they need to get things done" $( 7 5 \% )$

Students do not seem to express a liking for a strong teacher role in class, except in error correction. This is consistent with students' preference for a stronger learner role in class. Furthermore, teacher guidance and explanation could be negatively perceived, e.g., as a substitute for not providing clear structures and examples.

Students' preference for a weak teacher role may also be explained with reference to their Forms 6 and 7 English learning experience reported in the last chapter. The disproportionate amount of class time which they spend listening to the teacher and their dislike for answering teacher's questions may have turned them against a strong teacher role, especially that of explanation.

# ATTITUDES TOWARDS ENGLISH AND ITS USE

In this section we will first present what the results of the university student survey reveal about students attitudes to English and the use of English. We will then present some results of the Young Post survey which provide confirmatory and complementary information.

# The university student survey

Part A of the student questionnaire contains 18 statements to gauge various aspects of students' attitudes towards English. These aspects include what could be termed affective, socio-political and pragmatic attitudes. Affective attitudes refer to one's sense of ease or liking for English, English-speaking people and cultures. Socio-political attitudes denote beliefs about the use and status of English in Hong Kong. Pragmatic attitudes focus on the practical value of English for personal success in the modern world.

The reliability coefficient () of this section of the questionnaire is .84, indicating that it would produce consistent results when administered under similar circumstances.

Principal factor analysis was used to analyse the 18 attitude items. Three factors were identified and then rotated, using Varimax. The results reveal the expected grouping of attitudes into three factors, as can be seen in Figure 3. Factor 1 consists of affective attitudes, Factor 2 socio-political and Factor 3 pragmatic.

Factor 1 consists of affective attitudes. Ranked in order of their strength of association, these are:

I like talking with foreign people in English.

I like the sound of the English language.   
I often feel comfortable when I speak English.   
I like English-speaking people (British, Americans, Australians) and their way of life.   
I often do many things, e.g., watch TV, read books, etc. to improve my English.   
I learn English in order to understand foreigners and their culture.   
Learning English enables me to see and understand the world in a different Way.

Factor 2 consists of socio-political attitudes, namely:

English ought to be used more widely in Hong Kong.   
English ought to be a medium of instruction in most Hong Kong schools.   
English ought to be important in Hong Kong after 1997.   
English ought to be a compulsory subject at university in Hong Kong.

Factor 3 consists of prdgmatic attitudes, namely:

I learn English in order to improve my career prospects.   
English is an important world language.   
English is the sign of an educated person in Hong Kong.   
The use of English is one of the most important factors which has contributed to Hong Kong's success.

Figure 3 reveals that the factor loadings are not strong on the whole; they are the strongest for Factor 1. Three of the 18 items are independent; they do not fit into any category. They are:

I often feel I am different, like acting, when I speak English.   
I think of English as a colonial language in Hong Kong.   
I will lose my Chinese identity if I am good at English.

Bold figures indicate grouping of attitudes into factors.

Figure 3 Factor loadings after rotation

ANOVA analyses reveal that all three attitude factors have significant effects on students' speaking $( p < . 0 0 0 1 )$ and writing $( ( p < . 0 0 5 )$ self-ratings. Duncan's tests further show that the more positive the attitudes, the higher the self-ratings.

Factor 1 (affective attitudes) was also found to have significant effects on students' HKALE and HKASLE scores $( p < . 0 0 0 1 )$ : the more positive the affective attitudes, the better the English scores. Although students' attitudes in the first year of university could not be said to have affected their pre-university examination results, it seems likely that, since attitudes are formed over time, students' attitudes in Forms 6 and 7 were similar to what they were at the time of completing the questionnaire.

Figure 4 presents the 18 attitude statements as they are ranked by the percentage of agreement they solicited.

Figure 4 Rank order of attitude statements by $\%$ of agreement

# Pragmatic attitudes

f The statements which denote pragmatic attitudes drew the largest percentage of I agreement. These are "English is an important world language" $( 9 6 \% )$ , "I learn English to improve my career prospects" (93%), \*The use of English is one of the most important factors which has contributed to Hong Kong's success" $( 8 4 \% )$ and "English is the sign of an educated person in Hong.Kong" $( 8 0 \% )$ .These results show that students learn English for very practical reasons. Their largely instrumental motivation for learning English indicates that they see its practical value as deriving from its international status and its association with individual and societal success. These attitudes are similar to those found in other parts of Asia (Shaw, 1981; Richards, 1993; Yu and Atkinson, 1988b).

# Socio-political attitudes

Three of the four socio-political attitude statements also elicited high agreement : from students -- English ought to be important in Hong Kong after $1 9 9 7 ^ { \circ } ( 8 1 \% ) _ { : }$ "English ought to be used more widely in Hong Kong" $( 7 9 \% )$ and "English ought to be a compulsory subject at university in Hong Kong", $( 7 9 \% )$ . As regards whether "English ought to be a medium of instruction in most Hong Kong schools", fewer students $( 7 4 \% )$ agree with the statement.

: In keeping with the practical value ascribed to'English, students attribute a great : deal of importance to English and its use in Hong Kong now and beyond 1997. ! This is most probably why poll after poll shows that students as well as their : parents believe it would be more important to learn English than Putonghua if | they could only be good at one (Boyle, 1996; Lee, 1995). However, students seem to be saying, at the same time, that English use in academic settings is not enough. They think English ought to be used more widely in Hong Kong, rather than used in restricted circumstances at work or in study, as is the case at present,/This could be a further explanation for their wanting to focus on using everyday language in university English classes, as mentioned earlier.

The importance students attach to the status and use of English in Hong Kong is also reflected in Figure 5.

![](img/392b8df31d2d48722565d8bfbf1468b66a061553353d0878e03220bc59ec3a02.jpg)  
Figure 5 Importance rating of factors affecting English language ability

65 Your family background   
66 Your English teacher   
67 Your school   
68 The Government's education and language policy   
69 Society's attitudes to English use

As Figure 5 shows, students think that society's attitudes to English use are of equal importance to their school as factors affecting their language ability. Both factors are seen as less important, however, then the individual efforts of their English teachers and, above all, the students themselves.

Affective attitudes

Our survey reveals that students' affective attitudes towards English are positive.. $7 7 \%$ indicated that they like the sound of the English language; $7 6 \%$ like talking with foreign people in English; $7 5 \%$ think that learning English enables them to see and understand the world in a different way and $62 \%$ learn English in order to understand foreigners and their culture. (These attitudes, like the pragmatic attitudes mentioned earlier, echo what is found in Asia in general (e.g., Shaw, 1981; Yu and Atkinson, 1988b). $\begin{array} { c } { { \vdots } } \\ { { \vdots } } \end{array}$

In spite of these positive attitudes, only $5 7 \%$ feel comfortable when they speak English, $56 \%$ like English-speaking people (British, Americans, Australians) and their way of life, and $5 5 \%$ often do many things, (e.g., watch TV, read books) to improve their English.

These results suggest that affective attitudes towards English are strong with respect to the language itself and its potential as a window on the world and other

"English was once the scorned symbol of colonialism. No More. Today, it is Asia's unifying tongue and its language of opportunity." (McGurn, 1996: 40)

cultures. However, these affective attitudes are less positive when it comes to liking or identifying with peoples and cultures. The results also point to a gap between students' positive attitudes towards English and their motivation to take concrete steps to improve their English.

# English and cultural identity

It is sometimes suggested that some students' apparent reluctance to speak English is caused by identity problems. This has even led to the coining of the term "banana complex" ("yellow outside, white inside"; see Branegan, 1991) to describe a form of identity conflict felt by some East Asians when using English. Similarly, it has been suggested that the English achievement of some Hong Kong students is affected by negative attitudes towards English as a medium of communication. For example, Pierson et al. (1980) assert that many Hong Kong students' English learning and achievement are hindered by negative perceptions of English as a language of colonisation.

Our survey results contradict these views. They show that only $1 1 \%$ think they will lose their Chinese identity if they are good at English. Furthermore, students think of English more as an important world language $( 9 6 \% )$ than a colonial one $( 5 7 \% )$ ./If students were indeed inhibited at one time by perceptions of English as a colonial language, our survey and other studies (e.g., $\mathbf { Y } \mathbf { u }$ and Atkinson, $1 9 8 8 \mathrm { b }$ ; Pennington and Yue, 1993; Pennington, 1994; Boyle, 1996) indicate that these perceptions have now diminished and that students' atitudes to English have been affected by broader social and political changes.

It can be argued that as Asians acquire stronger cultural identities, English becomes less a threat. Also, because English is now perceived as a world language, it is no longer the property of the English and has a status that is far less culture-specific than before. One can like a foreign language without necessarily identifying with its people or culture; one can learn a language without diminishing one's cultural identity.

# The Young Post readers' survey

In the Young Post readers' survey, students were asked to indicate, from a list of attitude statements, which three best describe their attitudes towards English and its use.

The findings of the Young Post readers' survey are similar to those of the university student survey. Figure 6 reveals that $46 \%$ of the respondents feel the obligation to learn English well. Although $3 6 \%$ feel anxious and nervous, and $2 5 \%$ feel unnatural and self-conscious when using English, there are still $2 5 \%$ of Students who are happy and excited to use it.

Figure 6 also illustrates that the majority of the motivating factors for learning English are very practical, e.g., $45 \%$ for future work and $3 7 \%$ for study. Almost half $( 4 2 \% )$ of the students said they feel motivated to learn English because it is an international language. Some $34 \%$ learn English "For communicating with English-speaking people".

Like the first-year university students, then, the students in the Young Post survey have positive attitudes towards communicating with English-speaking people, but often feel anxious or uncomfortable when they use English. They see English as an international language and learn it for its practical value -- they can communicate with people from other parts of the world and understand the world outside

Students were asked to indicate, from a list of attitude statements, which three best describe their attitudes towards English and its use. The comprehensiveness of the options given inevitably reduces the chance of each option being chosen. Any one option chosen by say, $30 \%$ of the students out of 17 options, is considered a popular one.

1 Integrative motivation is usually identified with positive attitudes towards the target language group and a desire for integrating into that group, or at the very least an interest in communicating with members of that group. (Crookes and Schmidt, 1991

Hong Kong. Their motivation and performance objectives are high.

In open-ended responses, $32 \%$ of the Young Post respondents indicated that they feel anxious because they feel their English, especially oral English, is poor and that they are not confident about it. $\mathrm { \Delta T 1 \% }$ pointed out that the-underlying reason for their weakness in English is lack of practice. Some $9 \%$ are very afraid of making mistakes, not being able to answer teachers' questions well, not being understood or being laughed at.

![](img/3b45da28c232875d1b777eeeba976a1d08b27aadab3ae09bf5c146feb9b07867.jpg)

# The integrative-instrumental dichotomy

Both surveys' findings on attitudes towards English echo those found in other parts of Asia (e.g., Shaw, 1981; Yu and Atkinson, 1988b; Richards, 1993), i.e., that students have strong instrumental but weak integrative motiyation'. At first glance, learning English for communicating with English-speaking people may point to integrative motivation, but some students in the Young Post survey commented on the need to grasp every chance to communicate with Englishspeaking people because there are so few practice opportunities in predominantly Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong. In other words, students communicate with English-speaking people to learn English rather than the other way round.

Integrative motivation has often been said to be essential for facilitating second language learning (Gardner and Lambert, 1959, Gardner, 1985). However, many people now question the reality of the whole integrative/instrumental dichotomy, especially its applicability in the Asian context. Morgan (1993), for example, raises doubt about the significance of integrative orientations in second or foreign language learning contexts where the amount of contact with Englishspeaking people and culture is by and large minimal, as is the case in Hong Kong. Markus and Kitayama (1991), in a broader context, suggest that because Asians and Westerners tend to differ in the way they perceive themselves in relation to other individuals and to society in general, the self-constructs,often assumed in motivation research conducted by Western scholars may not be relevant to many Asians.

# SUMMARY

# Students' preferred learning activities and teaching methods at university

1. Students exhibit an orientation to active and communicative modes of learning English.   
2. Students' desire for an active speech role in class does not diminish after gaining entry to university; they adopt a very positive attitude towards fluency development, e.g., through listening, speaking, group and pair work.   
3. Students wish to have more opportunities to develop their fluency in using everyday English.   
4. Students attach more importance to fluency than to correct grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation in university English classes.   
5. - However, their desire to participate in active communication in English is accompanied by an equally strong desire to have their mistakes corrected by the teacher.   
6. Although students value teacher correction, they have less liking for teacher guidance and explanation in other aspects of learning.

# Students' attitudes towards English

1.  Students' affective attitudes towards English are positive, e.g., they like the sound of the English language, and they like talking with foreign people in English.   
2. Despite these positive attitudes, $4 3 \%$ of students feel uncomfortable or anxious when they speak English.   
3. Many students have high performance expectations when they speak English and some are very afraid of making mistakes or being laughed at.   
4. Students adopt very pragmatic attitudes towards English: 93% learn English in order to improve their career prospects.   
5. 96% of students strongly agree that English is an important world language.   
80% also see English as the sign of an educated person in Hong Kong and as one of the most important factors which has contributed to Hong Kong's success.   
6. Students agree that English ought to be important in Hong Kong after 1997 and that it ought to be used more widely in Hong Kong.   
7. Even though English is a colonial language in Hong Kong, 44% of students do not think of it as such.   
8. 89% of students strongly disagree that they will lose their Chinese identity if they are good at English.   
9. All attitude factors have a significant effect on confidence in the productive skills: the more positive the attitudes, the higher the speaking and writing self-ratings.

Profile of PRC students: a comparison with Hong Kong students ' In view of the small numbers involved, they are not necessarily a representative sample of university students in the PRC.

At an early stage in the LEAP Project, contacts were established with three universities in the PRC (one in Beijing and two in Xi'an). It was decided to investigate a small sample of students from the PRC in order to obtain comparative data which would both be useful to colleagues in the PRC and help to illuminate our profile of Hong Kong students.

The Hong Kong student questionnaire, adapted where appropriate, was completed by 340 PRC students in October 1995. The adapted questionnaire and its response summary is given in Appendix 2. The response rate was $100 \%$ and the final analysable sample was $3 3 0 ^ { 1 }$ . Of these, 92 were English majors and 238 were English minors (majoring in Engineering or Science); $31 \%$ were female and $6 9 \%$ were male.

The Vocabulary Levels Test (Appendix 6) completed by Hong Kong students was taken by 65 English majors from Beijing and Xi'an. Chapter Three gives a more detailed description of the Hong Kong and PRC samples, sampling methods, data collection methods, response rates and methods of data processing and analysis.

# SELF-ASSESSMENT OF ENGLISH LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY

In Part B of the adapted questionnaire, PRC students were asked to rate their English proficiency. The purposes were:

to elicit students' judgements of which aspects of English competence are most important for academic communication;   
to find out students' perceptions of their own competence and of the aspects which cause them difficulty, and   
to enable us to compare PRC students' perceptions with those of Hong Kong students.

Please refer to Chapter Four for a more detailed profile of Hong Kong students' perceptions.

# Speaking: a comparison of PRC and Hong Kong students' perceptions

Figure 1 shows the average rating distribution of PRC and Hong Kong students for 10 speaking items. A t-test indicates that PRC and Hong Kong students mean rating difference is significant $( \mathrm { m e a n } = 3 . 6$ and 4.2 respectively, $\$ <$ .0001). We can see that PRC students rated their speaking proficiency significantly Iower than Hong Kong students, except in using grammar, idioms and colloquial expressions, and pronouncing words correctly.

# Which aspects of students'speech are considered best and worst?

PRC students differed from Hong Kong students in rating "using different kinds of English for different purposes" (rather than "using idioms and colloquial expressions") as the worst aspect of their speech. They also considered this to be one of the two most important aspects for successful communication, perhaps indicating that they have a strong sense of the sociolinguistic aspects of speech.

PRC and Hong Kong students agreed in rating "unplanned communication" as their second least proficient aspect but one of the two most important aspects for academic communication. PRC students rated pronunciation and grammar.as their best aspects (compared with planned speech and pronunciation for Hong Kong students).

Which two features are considered most important for successful academic communication?

Figure 1 PRC and Hong Kong students' rating of speaking ability: a comparison

At the end of each skill rating section, students were asked to choose two items which are most important for successful academic communication. As shown in the legend of Figure 1, both PRC and Hong Kong students place a lot of importance on unplanned speech, but PRC students ranked the ability to "use different kinds of English for different purposes" the second most important feature. It is significanr that they chose an aspect which covers both academic and non-academic speaking proficiency since, in listening and reading too, PRC students value most those aspects which also affect non-academic communication.

The numbers on the horizontal axis are the same as those used in the student questionnaire and the scale on the vertical axis is reversed for all bar graph presentations in this chapter.

All items refer to ability to use English in class, except where outside class is specifically stated.

32 Communicate successfully without planning   
33 Use correct grammar   
34 Pronounce words correctly   
35 Use idioms and colloquial expressions correctly

38 Respond to comments or questions fluently in class   
39 Raise appropriate questions or comments in class   
40 Say several sentences in a row fluently in informal conversations outside class

# Writing: a comparison of PRC and Hong Kong students' perceptions

Figure 2 shows the average rating distribution of PRC and Hong Kong students for seven writing items. A t-test indicates that PRC and Hong Kong students' mean rating difference is significant $( { \mathrm { m e a n } } = 3 . 8$ and 4.3 respectively, $\phi <$ .0001). We can see that PRC students rated their writing proficiency significantly lower than Hong Kong students, except in using grammar, idioms and colloquial expressions correctly.

3 The ability to "use idioms and colloquial expressions correctly" was rated lowest but it is less relevant to academic writing.

# Which aspects of students' writing are considered best and worst?

Unlike Hong Kong students, who consider their use of grammar the worst aspect of their academic writing, PRC students think that this is the best aspect of their writing. Both PRC and Hong Kong students rated their ability to \*use key vocabulary correctly" the second worst aspect of their academic writing.

Which two features are considered most important for successful academic communication?

As can be seen in the legend of Figure 2, PRC and Hong Kong students are in complete agreement as to which two features are most important for successful academic communication. One of the two features is the global item 42 (Communicate thoughts and ideas successfully). The other is the ability to "organise ideas or arguments coherently".

![](img/1d1a8c08dad4f9d2fbb0b716b1fc960d31d9f9d2cd8453963aba5b5c15f40344.jpg)

# Listening: a comparison of PRC and Hong Kong students' perceptions

Figure 3 shows the average rating distribution of PRC and Hong Kong students for six listening items. A t-test indicates that PRC and Hong Kong students' mean rating difference is significant $\{ \tt m e a n \mathrm { ~ = ~ } 4 \mathrm { ~ }$ and 4.8 respectively, $\phi <$ .0001). We can see that PRC students rated all aspects of their listening proficiency significantly lower than Hong Kong students.

# Which aspects of students' listening are considered best and worst?

Like Hong Kong students, PRC students consider their ability to "understand spoken English delivered at normal speed in class" the best aspect of their academic listening and their ability to "understand spoken English in informal conversations outside class" the worst. However, PRC students think that their worst aspect is also one of the most important aspects of successful academic listening, as illustrated in the following section.

Which two features are considered most important for successful academic communication?

As shown in the legend of Figure 3, PRC and Hong Kong students agree that one of the two most important features is the ability to "understand spoken English delivered at normal speed in class". But as in the case of speaking, PRC students chose a non-academic aspect of the skill as the other most important feature. This is the ability to "understand spoken English in informal conversations outside class'.  Again, PRC students' concern for successful non-academic communication manifests itself in these findings and is indicative of the orientation of English teaching and learning in the PRC towards non-academic communication.

53 Identify relationships among ideas

55 Understand spoken English in informal conversations outside class

# Reading: a comparison of PRC and Hong Kong students' perceptions

Figure 4 shows the average rating distribution of PRC and Hong Kong students for five reading items. A t-test indicates that PRC and Hong Kong students mean rating difference is significant $\{ { \tt m e a n } = 4$ and 4.6 respectively, $\hbar <$ .0001). We can see that PRC students rated all aspects of their reading proficiency significantly lower than Hong Kong students.

# Which aspects of students' reading are considered best and worst?

Both PRC and Hong Kong students rated global item 58 -- their ability to "identify the main ideas in a piece of academic reading" -- the best and item 61 -- their ability to "understand newspapers and magazines" -- the worst. Again, PRC students think that their worst aspect is also one of the most important aspects of successful academic reading, as illustrated in the following section.

Which two features are considered most important for successful academic communication?

As shown in the legend of Figure 4, PRC and Hong Kong students agree that one of the two most important features is the ability to "identify the main ideas in a piece of academic reading". But as in the case of speaking and listening, PRC students chose a non-academic aspect of the skill as the other most important feature. This is the ability to "understand newspapers and magazines". Again, PRC students' concern for successful non-academic communication manifests itself in these findings and is indicative of the orientation of English teaching and learning in the PRC towards non-academic communication.

# Mean ratings of the four skills

Figure 5 summarises the mean ratings of the four skills by PRC and Hong Kong students. Both groups rated speaking the lowest and writing the second lowest, indicating that students experience more difficulty in the productive than the receptive skills. These results are consistent with the fact that it is generally regarded as easier to understand a language than to speak and write it. The low rating for speaking also reflects the lack of practice opportunities enjoyed by both Hong Kong students and (as we will see later) PRC students in their previous learning.

![](img/945c8ca33b159a3e6812c511e519982fda0a2b500b55f3a83f6c1d2370ff0cb4.jpg)  
Figure 5 PRC and Hong Kong students' mean ratings of the four skills: a comparison

# Listening: the most important skill

Students ranked the importance of each skill for academic success, which is defined as "getting an average grade in the department'. Figure 6 reveals that all skills are considered important by PRC students, although listening and reading are relatively more important than speaking and writing.

Unlike Hong Kong students, who consider writing the most important skill for academic success, PRC students see it as the least important of the four skills. This can be explained by the fact that most PRC students, other than English majors, do not write their academic assignments in English.

PRC students see listening as the most important and reading the second most important skill for academic success. If academic lectures are not conducted in English in the three PRC universities surveyed, why should listening be such an important skill for academic success? Or did PRC students rank the importance Of each skill according to some other criteria?

![](img/744537cc780ac2711ba3c48fca47ebbaa67cd7c4befb04589cb9c26259b63abb.jpg)  
Figure 6 PRC and Hong Kong students' mean ratings of skill importance: a comparison

One way of interpreting this particular finding is to examine it in relation to other findings in the questionnaire and to the overall context of English teaching and learning in the PRC. The following reasons may explain why listening is the most important skill for PRC students:

As mentioned earlier, PRC students' concern for successful non-academic communication is indicative of the orientation of English teaching and learning in the PRC towards non-academic communication. This could mean that students ranked the importance of the four skills according to their contribution to non-academic rather than academic success. As can be seen in later sections, PRC students have minimal listening input. Most of their class time is spent listening to the teacher, who teaches in mostly Chinese, or doing reading and grammar exercises. As a result they may feel deprived of listening opportunities and place especially high value on listening.

This explanation is supported by students' strong liking for watching videos and doing listening comprehensive in class (although neither activity is frequent). Outside class, too, listening to tapes is the most frequent activity.

# Factors affecting self-assessment

A number of factors which affected PRC students' self-rating of their English proficiency will be looked at here. Although students' English examination results are also hypothesised to have an effect on their self-ratings, no information about their examination performance has been obtained.

# Faculty

PRC students come from three faculties: Science, Engineering and Arts (English). English majors invariably rated their proficiency significantly higher than Science and Engineering majors $( x < . 0 5 )$ , except in reading, where English and Engineering majors rated their ability significantly better than Science majors $( p < . 0 0 0 1 )$

# Gender

There is reliable evidence (reported for example by Ellis, 1994; Larsen-Freeman and Long, 1991) that females tend to be better at learning a second language than males. It is therefore no surprise that they also perceive themselves to be better. Like Hong Kong female students, PRC female students' $( 3 1 \%$ of the sample) mean self-ratings on all four skills are significantly higher than those of male students $( p < . 0 0 5 )$

# Overall learning experience in Forms 6 and 7

The effect of overall English learning experience in Forms 6 and 7 is significant on students' four skill self-ratings $( p < . 0 5 )$ . The better the learning experience, the higher the self-ratings.

# Medium of instruction used in Forms 6 and 7 English lessons

The effect of the medium of instruction used in Forms 6 and 7 English lessons is significant on self-ratings. In speaking, the more consistently English was used as the medium of instruction, the higher the speaking self-rating $( p < . 0 5 )$ . In other skill areas, a significant difference emerged between those who were taught in a mix of Chinese and English $3 2 \%$ of the sample) and those in mostly Chinese $( 3 5 \%$ of the sample). Students who were taught in mostly Chinese rated themselves significantly lower $( p < . 0 5 )$

# SEMI-PRODUCTIVE VOCABULARY KNOWLEDGE

Please refer to Chapter Five for a more detailed description of the test and of the profile of Hong Kong students' lexical proficiency.

The Vocabulary Levels Test (Appendix 6) administered to 110 Hong Kong students was also administered to 65 PRC students (English majors) in Beijing and Xi'an. Mean scores were then compared between the Hong Kong group (excluding the native speakers) and the PRC groups.

Figure 7 reveals PRC and Hong Kong students' mean $\%$ scores at each word frequency level. t-tests show that the mean differences are not significant, except at the UWL (university word list) level. Figure 7 further shows that:

from a list of words ranging from the 2,000th most common word to the 3,000th most common word (i.e., the 3rd 1,000 most frequently used words), PRC English majors knew an average of $6 3 \%$ (Hong Kong average $= 6 4 \%$ :

from the 5th 1,000 most frequently used words, PRC English majors knew an average of $2 9 \%$ (Hong Kong average $= 2 9 \%$ ); and   
from a so-called university word list (UWL) comprised of 836 words which occur frequently in university texts of various subjects (but excluding the first 2,000 most common English words), the average for PRC English majors was $2 9 \%$ (Hong Kong average $= 6 6 \%$ :

ww3.000-word.o JWA w PRC (N65) 6 1: 63 64ww. 66 , . 0007 ciaimid

$3 6 5 \%$ is regarded as the minimum for reading without struggling with too many unfamiliar words. (Nation, 1995)

The results of the semi-productive vocabulary study above indicate that:

like most Hong Kong students, PRC English majors are likely to struggle with many unfamiliar words while reading general, non-academic texts, since they scored less than $6 5 \%$ at the 5,000-word level';   
but unlike most Hong Kong students, who have wider knowledge of words used in university texts, PRC English majors are likely to struggle with reading university texts as well, since they scored below 65% at the university word level (UWL). This also reflects the fact that they have learned English primarily in contexts where English has not served as a medium for academic communication.

Please refer to Chapter Six for a more detailed profile of Hong Kong students' Iearning experience in Forms 6 and 7.

Students' overall English experience was rated on a 6-point Likert scale using five descriptive statements. Figure 8 reveals the extent of PRC and Hong Kong students' agreement to these statements. A t-test shows that the mean difference between the groups is significant $( p < . 0 0 0 1 )$ : PRC students indicated that they had a more positive English learning experience in Forms 6 and 7 than Hong Kong students.

In particular, PRC students liked their English lessons and thought they had a good English teacher in Forms 6 and 7, though like Hong Kong students, the statement they agreed least with is $^ { \mathrm { { c } \mathrm { { c } } } } \mathrm { { I } }$ learned a lot of English in Forms 6 and $7 ^ { \circ }$

# Medium of instruction in English lessons in Forms 6 and 7

Figure 9 shows that only $2 \%$ of PRC students surveyed were taught in "All English" in English lessons in Forms 6 and 7, compared to Hong Kong's $2 6 \%$ $3 6 \%$ were taught in "Mostly Chinese", compared to Hong Kong's $1 1 \%$ .The percentages taught in "Mostly English" and "Mix of Chinese and English" are roughly the same in both the Hong Kong and PRC samples.

# Frequency of English lesson activities in Forms 6 and 7

In this part of the questionnaire survey, students were asked to indicate, on a 5- point verbal frequency scale, how often they participated in 12 English learning activities. As shown in Figure 10, the frequency of activities in PRC and Hong Kong English classrooms reveals several variations as well as similarities.

Like Hong Kong students, PRC students spent most class time listening to the teacher (item 85) and least watching videos and doing role-play/drama (items 84 and 81). PRC students appear to have spent more time on grammar and vocabulary exercises (items 76 and 79) in class but less on group discussion and listening comprehension (items 80 and 83) than Hong Kong students.

In general PRC students appear to have spent a larger proportion of time than Hong Kong students on more traditional, language-focused activities and even less time engaged in active communication.

# English lesson activity preferences in Forms 6 and 7

Figure 11 PRC and HK students' English lesson activity preferences: a comparison   
Figure 11 reveals PRC and Hong Kong students' liking for the same 12 activities on a 6-point Likert-type scale. Interestingly, PRC students express significantly more liking for all 12 English activities in class than Hong Kong students $( p <$ .0001).

Like Hong Kong students, PRC students liked watching videos most (item 84, a rare activity). This is followed by listening (item 83, a not-so-frequent activity) and reading comprehension (item 82, a frequent activity). The activities they liked least in Forms 6 and 7 are grammar and vocabulary exercises (items 76 and 79), two activities which took place often.

# Reasons for activity preferences

![](img/99541d90c7ed1297f8f5f8d0aa79a0d4a7e32cbedea7c5308d8eb69d935c54ab.jpg)  
Figure 12 Reasons for liking certain English lesson activities: a PRC-HK comparison

88 I was good at the activities.   
89 The teacher was good.   
90 Ilearned a lot.   
91 The activities were challenging.   
92 The activities gave me the chance to speak and interact with my classmates.   
93 The activities were useful for examinations.

Figure 12 shows the average ratings of five possible reasons for students' activity preferences on a 6-point scale.' Like Hong Kong students, the most frequent reason for liking certain English lesson activities is "The activities gave me a chance to speak and interact with my classmates'. Unlike their Hong Kong counterparts, however, PRC students found the challenge of an activity a more powerful reason for liking the activity than its usefulness for examinations.

# Frequency of outside-class English activities in Forms 6 and 7

Figure 13 shows the mean frequencies of 10 out-of-class English activities which students reported doing when in Forms 6 and 7. We can see that neither PRC nor Hong Kong students undertook any of the activities often. Only a few of the activities were sometimes done outside class.

PRC students reportedly spent on average even less time on English activities than Hong Kong students $( \phi < . 0 0 0 1 )$ . However, they listened to tapes and to the radio, read books and kept a vocabulary notebook more often than Hong Kong students. Unlike Hong Kong students, who watched English language TV most often outside class, PRC students listened to tapes most often outside class.

Figure 14 shows PRC and Hong Kong students' average liking for the same 10 outside-class English activities. As with in-class activities, PRC students express significantly (p< .o0o1) more liking for their English activities outside class in Forms 6 and 7 than Hong Kong students. Unlike Hong Kong students, who enjoyed watching TV (the most frequent outside-class activity) and speaking with friends most, PRC students enjoyed reading books and listening to tapes most.

# PREFERRED LEARNING ACTIVITIES AND TEACHING METHODS ATUNIVERSITY

Please refer to Chapter Seven for a more detailed profile of Hong Kong students' learning preferences and attitudes towards English and its use.

Students' English learning preferences at university were measured by twelve statements on a 6-point Likert scale. Each of the twelve statements taps the degree of students' preference for a particular type of learning activity, learning material or learning style. The rationale underlying the twelve statements is explained in Chapter Seven.

![](img/8274b65611f7c9685156f9447b23951cebb3d4addfc4db83aa867767bf6dece9.jpg)  
Figure 15 PRC and Hong Kong students' mean ratings of methodology preferences in university English classes: a comparison

I like a university English class in which:

1 learning focuses on the importance of correct grammar, vocabulary and pronunciatio. 2 learning focuses on the importance of fluency. 3. students do most of the talking. $\textcircled { 4 } \textcircled { \times }$ lot of attention is paid to listening and speaking. 5 a lot of attention is paid to using everyday language. 6 materials contain a lot of communication exercises, e.g., role-plays, discussions, etc. 7 a lot of materials from real life (e.g., TV, radio) are used. 8 teacher helps students to find out for themselves the language they need to get things done. 9 teacher corrects most of the mistakes that students make. 10 teacher explains the learning purpose of class activities. 11 there is a lot of teacher guidance,and explanation. 12 there is a lot of group and pair work.

Figure 15 shows that PRC students express a stronger agreement than Hong Kong students with a "weak" communicative methodology in which traditional and communicative principles are combined. This is consistent with what $\mathtt { O r }$ (1994) finds in her study of PRC and Hong Kong students' beliefs about methodology in foreign language classrooms. A t-test further reveals that the mean difference is significant $( p < . 0 0 0 1 )$

In particular, PRC students agree more strongly than Hong Kong students.thatstudents should do most-of the talking, a lot of attention should be paid to listening and speaking; and a lot of real life materials such as TV/radio broadcasts should be used. However, their preference for group and pair work is not so strong. It appears that both PRC and Hong Kong students are keen on fluency. related activities, although PRC students may not see group and pair work as closely connected to fluency development.

Like Hong Kong students, PRC students express the least agreement with item 11 (There is a Iot of teacher guidance and explanation). They do not show preference for a strong teacher role in class, except in error correction.

# ATTITUDES TOWARDS ENGLISH AND ITS USE

Only 11 of the 18 statements in the Hong Kong student questionnaire were used to gauge various aspects of PRC students' attitudes towards English.  The remaining seven items deal with attitudes about the use and status of English in Hong Kong and are irrelevant for PRC students.

The 11 items deal with affective and pragmatic attitudes towards English. Affective attitudes refer to one's sense of ease or liking for English, Englishspeaking people and cultures. Pragmatic attitudes signify the practical value of English for personal success in the modern world.

![](img/bc1cbb523645f46eda99e99e373a659c7b0c3817e1629c8d553d1aa9a1b3b5ac.jpg)  
Figure 16 PRC and HK students' mean attitude ratings towards English: a comparison

13 I often feel comfortable when I speak English.   
14 I often feel I am different, like acting, when I speak English.   
15 I like the sound of the English language.   
16 I like talking with foreign people in English.   
17 I like English-speaking people (British, Americans, Australians) and their way of life.   
18 Ilearn English in order to understand foreigners and their culture.   
19 I learn English in order to improve my career prospects.   
20 learning English enables me to see and understand the world in a different way.   
21 English is an important world language.   
22 I often do many things, e.g., watch TV, read books, etc. to improve my English.   
30 I will lose my Chinese identity if I am good at English

Figure 16 shows that PRC students, like Hong Kong students, are keenly aware of the importance of English as a world language (item 21) and see it as a means to furthering their career prospects (item 19). This pragmatic orientation is less marked than with Hong Kong students, however, and is exceeded by PRC students' beliefs that English enables them to "see and understand the world in a different way" (item 20). Items 20 and 21 together may indicate that PRC students' pragmatism is manifested in a desire to see and understand the outside world.

PRC students' affective attitudes towards English are on the whole stronger than those of Hong Kong students, except that they indicate little liking for English people and their way of life. Their disagreement with $^ { \mathrm { { s c } } } \mathrm { { I } }$ will lose my Chinese identity if I am good at English' (item 30) is even stronger than that of Hong Kong students and indicates that PRC students do not associate English with diminishing cultural identity.

# Factors affecting English language ability

When asked to rate several factors as influences on their English language ability (items 64-69), PRC students, like their counterparts in Hong Kong, attach a great deal of importance to individual motivation and society's attitudes to English use as factors affecting their English language ability.

# SUMMARY

The findings reported in this section are based on the results of questionnaires (adapted from the Hong Kong student questionnaire) completed by 330 students (92 English majors and 238 Science and Engineering majors) from three universities (one in Beijing and two in Xi'an) in the PRC.

# Perceptions of English competence for academic communication

1. PRC students rated their proficiency in all four skills significantly lower than Hong Kong students, except in using grammar, idioms and colloquial expressions, and pronouncing words correctly.   
2. Unlike Hong Kong students, PRC students consider non-academic skill features most important for successful communication, which reflects the orientation of English learning towards non-academic communication.   
3. PRC students also consider these non-academic features the worst aspects of their proficiency. This may explain why they tend to adopt a stronger communicative orientation to English teaching and learning than Hong Kong students (see \*Preferred learning activities and teaching methods at university" below).   
4. In speaking, PRC students think that the ability to "use different kinds of English for different purposes" is most important, followed (as with Hong Kong students) by the ability to "communicate without planning". In listening, it is the ability to "understand spoken English in informal conversations outside class" and in reading, the ability to "understand newspapers and magazines".   
5. Unlike Hong Kong students, who see writing as the most important skill for academic success, PRC students see writing as the least important and listening as the most important, though probably for non-academic reasons rather than academic'success. --

# Semi-productive vocabulary

The findings reported in this section are based on the results of a test of semiactive or controlled productive vocabulary at three frequency levels. This test (the same as the one completed by Hong Kong students) was completed by 65 first-year English majors in the PRC.

From a list of words ranging from the 2,o0oth most common word to the 3,000th most common word (i.e., the 3rd 1,000 most frequently used words), PRC English majors knew an average of $6 3 \%$ (Hong Kong average $= 6 4 \%$ . From the 5th 1,000 most frequently used words, PRC English majors knew an average of $2 9 \%$ (Hong Kong average $= 2 9 \%$ : From a so-called university word list (UWL) comprised of 836 words which occur frequently in university texts of various subjects (but excluding the first 2,000 most common English words), the average for PRC English majors was $2 9 \%$ (Hong Kong average $= 6 6 \%$ :

$4 6 5 \%$ is regarded as the minimum for reading without struggling with too many unfamiliar words. (Nation, 1995)

The results of the semi-productive vocabulary study above indicate that:

1. like most Hong Kong students, PRC English majors are likely to struggle with many unfamiliar words while reading general, non-academic texts, since they scored less than $65 \%$ at the 5,000-word level';

2.  but unlike most Hong Kong students, who have wider knowledge of words used in university texts, PRC English majors are likely to struggle with reading university texts as well, since they scored below $6 5 \%$ at the university word level. This also indicates that they have learned English primarily in contexts where it has not served as a medium for academic communication.

# English learning experience in Forms 6 and 7

1. PRC students reportedly had a significantly more positive English learning experience in Forms 6 and 7 than Hong Kong students.   
2. Only $2 \%$ of PRC students surveyed were taught in "All English" in English lessons in Forms 6 and 7, compared to Hong Kong's $2 6 \%$ $3 6 \%$ were taught in "Mostly Chinese", compared to Hong Kong's $1 1 \%$ .The percentages taught in "Mostly English" and "Mix of Chinese and English" are roughly the same in both the Hong Kong and PRC samples.   
3. Like Hong Kong students, PRC students spent most class time listening to the teacher and least time watching videos and doing role-play/drama.   
4. PRC students appear to have spent more time on grammar and vocabulary exercises in class but less on group discussion and listening comprehension than Hong Kong students.   
5.  Like Hong Kong students, PRC students like watching videos most in class. This is followed by listening and reading comprehension. The activities they like least are grammar and vocabulary exercises.   
6. Like Hong Kong students, the most frequent reason for liking certain English lesson activities is \*The activities gave me a chance to speak and interact with my classmates". But unlike their Hong Kong counterparts, PRC students find the challenge of an activity a more powerful reason for liking the activity than its usefulness for examinations.   
7. Like Hong Kong students, PRC students did not often undertake English activities outside class in Forms 6 and 7. Only a few activities were sometimes done.   
8. Unlike Hong Kong students, who watch English language TV most often outside class, PRC students listen to tapes most often outside class.   
9. Outside class in Forms 6 and 7, PRC students reportedly spent on average even less time on English activities than Hong Kong students. However, PRC students listen to tapes and to the radio, read books and keep a vocabulary notebook more often than Hong Kong students.   
10. Unlike Hong Kong students, who enjoy watching TV (the most frequent outside class activity) and speaking with friends or classmates most, PRC students enjoyed reading books and listening to tapes most when they were outside class.   
11. PRC students expressed significantly more liking for their English activities both in and outside class in Forms 6 and 7 than Hong Kong students.

# Preferred learning activities and teaching methods at university

1. PRC students tend to adopt a stronger communicative orientation than Hong Kong students. They strongly agree that students should do most of the talking and that a lot of attention be paid to listening, speaking and using real life materials such as TV/radio broadcasts.   
2. However, their preference for group and pair work is not so strong. It appears that both PRC and Hong Kong students are keen on fluency-related activities, although PRC students may not see group and pair work as closely connected to fluency development.   
3. Like Hong Kong students, PRC students express the least preference for ${ \mathfrak { a } }$ lot of teacher guidance and explanation". They do not show preference for a strong teacher role in class, except in error correction.

# Attitudes towards English

1. PRC students appear to have more positive affective attitudes towards English than Hong Kong students, except that their liking for Englishspeaking people and their way of life is significantly lower.   
2. Their disagreement with $^ { \mathfrak { s c } } \mathbb { T }$ will lose my Chinese identity if I am good at English" is even stronger than that of Hong Kong students.   
3. Like Hong Kong students, PRC students strongly agree that English is an important world language. Like Hong Kong students, they see English as important in improving their career prospects, but perceive it even more as a way to "see and understand the world in a different way".   
4. PRC students, like their counterparts in Hong Kong, attach a great deal of importance to individual motivation and society's attitudes to English use as influences on English language ability.

# Implications of the LEAP findings

As stated at the beginning of Chapter One, LEAP's brief was to gather information which provides, for students entering university in Hong Kong, a profile of:

their previous experiences, in Forms 6 and 7, in learning and using English;   
their perceptions and attitudes with respect to English and English learning;   
their preferred ways of learning English;   
their strengths and weaknesses in using English for academic study purposes.

Some of the information we have gathered and summarised in this book should provide fresh insights into the complexities of the teaching and learning situation in Hong Kong. Some of the information, however, may seem familiar to university teachers and students in Hong Kong, either because the information reflects their personal experiences and observations or because the information has been documented in other research and studies. This is good news because the findings of a single study are not sufficient for establishing patterns of attitudes, beliefs and behaviour. As in clinical trials and research, only a series of studies will prove a point.

In this last chapter, we shall discuss some of the implications of the LEAP findings with regard to two major areas:

teaching and learning through the medium of English at university; and language policies at university.

# A TWO-FOLD STRATEGY FOR IMPROVING STUDENTS' LEARNING

Our LEAP findings suggest that a two-fold strategy is needed for improving students' learning through the medium of English:

In their English classes (at school and university) students need many more opportunities to activate their language and gain experience in using it for spoken and written communication.   
At the same time, in all of their classes, students need to gain more experience of methods of learning in which they adopt an active, questioning role which is appropriate to tertiary-level learning and, indeed, required for success in the modern world.

The first part of this strategy is mainly in the hands of specialist English Ianguage teachers, who now have a wide range of techniques at their disposal for developing students' communication skills. Introducing such techniques into more and more classrooms in Hong Kong must rank as a high priority for pre. service and in-service teacher education.

The second part of the strategy is perhaps more problematic, since it has to be implemented by all teachers in all of the settings where learning takes place. In the next section we will consider some ways in which all tertiary teachers might approach this task in their classrooms and lecture-halls.

# PEDAGOGIC IMPLICATIONS FOR TERTIARY-LEVEL TEACHERS

There are many forms of classroom support that tertiary teachers can establish to help first-year students learn through the medium of English. Most obviously, they can provide more measures to support students in their development and use of the language required for academic study. They can also provide other forms of support through the ways in which they organise learning, use teaching aids or create contexts for peer help. In the following pages we will outline some strategies for providing these different forms of support. They will be presented under five main headings:

Creating a supportive learning environment in lectures.   
Creating a supportive learning environment in tutorials and small groups.   
Providing constructive forms of feedback.   
Providing language support.   
Helping students to use audio-visual media.

Some of these strategies may require teachers to spend additional time in preparation or to reduce the syllabus content of their courses. However, they are almost certain to bring about more effective learning and greater learner autonomy.

# Creating a supportive learning environment in lectures

In interviews and casual conversations with teachers, one hears about an increasing number of Cantonese-speaking teachers who, because of their empathy for students' struggle with learning in the medium of English or for other reasons, have acceded to students' requests that classes be conducted in Cantonese. Whatever immediate advantages this may bring, as a long-term strategy it is fraught with dangers. Given LEAP's finding that students receive negligible English input outside class, cutting down on English input in university classes may only further alienate them from the language they so desperately want to improve. What students need is not lectures in Cantonese, but lectures in English that is pitched at a level and rate they can understand.

Here are some of the strategies that tertiary teachers may adopt in order to help their students learn more effectively through lectures conducted in English:

Encourage students to prepare key vocabulary before lectures and let them share the results of their preparation with each other.   
Think more carefully about the kind of background information essential for students' comprehension of a topic or lecture.   
Make sure that lectures are tightly and explicitly organised.   
Whenever possible, relate lectures closely to assigned readings.   
Avoid frequent digressions (LEAP found that students have some difficulty recognising digressions such as jokes).   
Signal more clearly what is important and what is less important information.   
Provide clearer signalling of main points and new content (e.g., through visuals, intonation, emphasis, pauses, and gestures). Compile handouts which give students the overall structure of lectures and important details such as quotations or references.   
Provide lecture notes with blanks for students to fill in missing information. Round off each lecture with an oral or written summary of what students have learnt.   
Produce clearer diction and speak at a speech rate that allows students enough processing time.   
Experiment (e.g, together with a colleague) with more effective ways of projecting the voice in a large area.   
Introduce more varied ways of presentation through, e.g., spider or tree diagrams showing relationships among ideas, charts and graphs, etc.   
Explore the potential of the overhead projector for reinforcing the structure of a lecture, building up (e.g., through "overlays") a developing framework of information or concepts, and so on.   
Check students' comprehension frequently, e.g., by short exercises, questions or oral summaries done in small groups.   
Punctuate lectures with small group work.

The theme of small group work will be considered in more detail in the next section.

# Creating a supportive learning environment in tutorials and small groups

There is evidence that many students are prevented by anxiety and inhibitions from participating actively when they are in a group of more than six (see Koch and Terrell, 1991). An effective way of easing students gently into more active roles is therefore to set up smaller sub-groups within a lecture or tutorial. These are commonly classified into two kinds, which are however not always clearly distinct:

Buzz groups. These are pairs or small groups of students who discuss a task, often for only five minutes or less. They are not always required to report back.   
Syndicate groups. These are small groups of students (usually 4 to 6) who work on a problem or topic within a tutorial and report back to the whole group.

Such groups can be used to create a more supportive environment and provide opportunities for talk in English which is uninhibited yet task-focused. As well as functioning as contexts for sustained work on a problem or topic in a tutorial context, they can be slotted into lectures or tutorials at appropriate moments for brainstorming, questions and comments, clarification of concepts, and critical feedback. At the end of a lecture, a teacher may gain useful feedback by using buzz groups for a short round-up session in which students report ideas on a topic to the whole class.

When buzz groups or syndicate groups are used in the lecture or tutorial setting, they present several advantages:

They break the monotony of the usual question-answer-feedback pattern. They present less risk or threat to students, who have the safety of the group.   
They allow for greater learner participation and responsibility.   
They provide more practice opportunities.   
They create overall a more person-oriented learning environment.   
They harness for learning a behavioural trait well documented in crosscultural psychology: the relatively collectivist approach to human interaction in East Asian cultures (Bond, 1991; Hofstede, 1986).

Through participating in them, students can gradually increase their confidence in their language skills and in the value of their own ideas.

A useful handbook of ideas for organising learning in tutorials and smaller group settings is Habeshaw et al. (1992).

# Designing group work for success-- the language factor

It is clear from the LEAP findings that students enjoy taking part in group discussions and that these have the potential to involve them more closely in the teaching-learning process. However, some research (e.g., Lee, 1994) suggests that one source of difficulty, particularly for students with Iow proficiency, is that they sometimes fail to adopt in English the communication strategies which they normally use successfully when they use their mother tongue. In the worst case, a group could experience a total communication breakdown.

There is often a case for addressing these issues at the linguistic level. For example, we might make students more aware of the kinds of strategies needed for successful spoken communication. Such strategies include turn-taking, giving verbal or non-verbal feedback, and using "repair" strategies such as asking for repetition and clarification. In some cases, it may even be necessary to teach specific language for doing these things. For example, some students may need to be taught the language of clarification or they may need to see examples of paraphrase and be encouraged to use it when they do not have the right word(s) to express themselves. In many circumstances, too, teachers may need to provide students with appropriate and accurate linguistic models.

# Designing group work for success -- the task factor

Important factors in determining the nature of a group task are the extent to which it is structured through detailed instructions and the degree of unpredictability that it involves. One of our goals is to help students to participate in tasks which are progressively less structured and predictable and which, as a consequence, require higher levels of creativity and spontaneity. We must be prepared to move gradually along this dimension, however, so that students remain confident of their chances of success. Particularly for learners whose proficiency and confidence are low, the need for teachers to plan or design activities for success is more urgent than the need to design for unpredictability and spontaneity.

One way of designing speaking tasks for success is by careful preparation, in or outside class, of both language and subject matter. This can increase students' confidence in the facts and ideas they wish to express. It can also help them to achieve accuracy as well as fluency. Teachers need to remember that students who are accustomed to a passive mode of learning may need to be guided step by step along the way to uncertainty, spontaneity and autonomy.

# Designing group work for success -- the interaction factor

Apart from varying the amount of linguistic and subject matter preparation, teachers can also enhance the success of tutorials or small groups by inviting each group participant to present his or her views in turn. Although this procedure will take away some of the spontaneity of the "free-for-all" type of conversational exchange, it nevertheless makes sure that every participant gets heard. Sometimes, it might be useful and time-saving to make participants responsible for various questions or aspects of a topic.

Students are more willing to participate in groups if they have particular tasks to complete or precise objectives to achieve. For example, instead of the teacher formulating questions which are almost always answered only by students who are called on, students can be encouraged to formulate questions themselves within a buzz group. When a question is generated by a group, it is less likely to be perceived as the sign of slow learning or deficiency with which some students associate questions.

Teachers may also find it useful to pay attention to the different conversational styles in a group, which often determine the extent of one's participation in it. For example, a quiet student who is overshadowed by a very talkative group may find it easier to make a contribution in a group with less domineering members.

# Designing group work for success -- the attitude factor

In view of the mainly passive learning experience that students have had, it is important to address the socio-attitudinal aspects of students' anxiety and habitual behaviour. One way of helping students is through activities which heighten their awareness of how certain socio-attitudinal factors might be shaping their behaviour (see, e.g., Crookall and Oxford, 1991).

One type of awareness-raising group activity is what Foss and Reitzel (1991) term "rational emotive therapy", in which students share and examine their beliefs to see if these make sense. Figure 1 shows an example. Such activities may serve as safety valves for releasing some of the anxiety involved in speaking a foreign tongue. They also help students to gain support from their peers, develop more realistic performance expectations and feel less inhibited to speak in class.

Teachers can also make explicit their expectations and their perceptions of the learner's role by exploring with students the benefits of adopting an active role in learning at university. Once students are clear about what is expected of them and why, they can be encouraged to adopt a more active role and explore different modes of learning.

# Providing constructive forms of feedback

Feedback is a crucial point of contact between teachers and students. It affects in important ways the nature of the student-teacher relationship and how students perceive the value of their own contributions. It therefore needs to be given with great sensitivity to students' self-esteem in a trusting and supportive environment.

Feedback should not consist only of critical comment but also express praise and identify strengths. It should begin and end with positive statements. The feedback which students receive should enhance their confidence and proficiency rather than inhibit their desire to participate.

One of the purposes of feedback is improvement: students often need and expect explicit information on how they can improve. This means that feedback is usually more useful when it is immediate, direct and specific, although appropriately phrased questions may also be effective in prompting learners to reflect on their performance.

Teachers need to exercise special sensitivity in deciding when to correct students' language errors. On the one hand, our LEAP findings indicate-that students place high value on having their errors corrected, at least in English classes. Hyland's (1995) survey of 1,600 undergraduates at five Hong Kong universities shows that most students, particularly first- and second-years, believe that subject lecturers, too, should provide assistance with English. On the other hand, constant or obtrusive correction can create inhibitions, undermine self-esteem and distract attention from the meanings being communicated. Subject teachers may wish to correct only the most important errors in students' writing and point out quietly, perhaps at the end of a session, persistent speech errors of word-choice or structure which could hinder successful communication or a student's progress. We will return to the issue of error-correction in the next section.

Feedback need not always come from the teacher. Using simple and clear assessment criteria made available to students, different groups of students can share with the teacher the responsibility for giving evaluative feedback on different aspects of the task. This kind of verbal, interactive peer and teacher feedback is informative because it forms an integral part of the learning process and gives students clear signals about how to improve.

In some situations, it may even be possible to involve students in drawing up their own criteria for feedback and assessment. This can be effective both in increasing students' sense of participation and in encouraging them to reflect on their performance objectives.

# Providing language support

The LEAP findings indicate that students' written communication, at least in the argumentative genre, is hindered by the frequency of grammatical and lexical errors. These do not always affect the comprehensibility of the ideas and experienced teachers can often work out learners' meanings by contextual clues.

Often, however, the coherence of the ideas is affected and a piece of writing which communicates successfully with an experienced teacher may be seen as ineffective by other readers. If we are serious about helping students to improve their English, it is important to convey to them that lexical and grammatical accuracy matters.

The issue of whether students' lexical and grammatical errors should be corrected at university level is controversial. Many subject teachers do not see dealing with students' English as their job. Even some English teachers are reluctant to pay a lot of attention to students' grammar problems, since they believe that other aspects of students' writing (e.g., organisation and coherence) are more important at university level. However, the results of the LEAP survey indicate clearly that students still want their errors corrected. This is echoed by the results of studies of L2 students' responses to teacher feedback on their writing (Leki, 1991; Radecki and Swales, 1988) as well as by Hyland's (1995) survey mentioned above.

Obviously, if teachers are to meet students' desire for error correction, they need to be convinced that their corrections will make a difference. There is no lack of anecdotal evidence that students continue to make errors even after they have been corrected several times. However, there is also evidence (e.g., Ferris, 1995; Fathman and Whally, 1990) that students' revisions improve both in overall quality and in linguistic accuracy as a result of teachers' feedback on the content and form of their writing.

It is advisable for subject teachers to explain to their students how they will deal with linguistic errors, particularly if they propose to correct selected ones. Otherwise, a student may "try out" a particular formulation and, if it is not corrected, take this (wrongly) as confirmation that it is acceptable.

# Drafts, outlines and summaries

If written assignments are handed in only at the end of term to be graded, teachers are unlikely to have the pleasure of seeing improvement. However, written assignments can be structured in shorter forms such as drafts, outlines or summaries, which allow for teacher feedback, learner reflection and improvement. Teachers who have tried this approach also report that assessment becomes less overwhelming when it is spread over a series of related assignments.

Feedback is said to be most effective when it is given face-to-face, and another advantage of writing drafts and plans is that summative, face-to-face feedback can be given to the whole class. Another alternative to written feedback is oral feedback recorded on cassette for each student.

Students whose English is very weak may be encouraged to make summaries of their readings in groups before they embark on an independent piece of work.

# Detailed editing/assessment guidelines on English language

Another way of helping students to take a more disciplined approach to writing in English is to provide detailed guidelines on grammar and vocabulary. Examples can be obtained from students' writing to illustrate areas of grammar and vocabulary they need to pay special attention to. For example, they need to make sure that every clause or sentence has a subject-verb-object/complement structure, that verb tenses are used appropriately and that key vocabulary is used with appropriate collocations.

Such guidelines can serve more than one function. Before students hand in an assignment, they can function as an editing checklist. Afterwards they can serve as criteria for evaluation and assessment. When students know the criteria by which their work will be assessed, there is generally more incentive to meet those criteria.

The grammar and vocabulary checklist is likely to be separate from other assessment criteria relating to content and organisation.

# Portfolios and model essays

A most effective way of giving support for written work and setting standards and expectations is through model answers, essays or plans. Students can be given time to examine these models in groups, so that they can focus on elements which require special attention when editing.

A portfolio can simply be a collection of written work a student has done over a period of time. It is a useful tool in helping both students and teachers to monitor work and see evidence of improvement.

# Outside help

Taking grammar and vocabulary into account in assessment helps to convey the message to students that grammar and vocabulary are still important at university (LEAP interviews show that students have the impression that university teachers do not care about their grammar and vocabulary). It also motivates students to seek outside help for English enhancement when this is needed.

For students who have persistent difficulty with English grammar, teachers may recommend self-study books which deal with this, such as:

Christopher Green: English Grammar in Focus: A Test, Practice and Reference Book for Chinese Learners. Hong Kong: Macmillan, 1995.   
Raymond Murphy: English Grammar in Use (with answers). (2nd ed.). Cambridge University Press, 1994.   
Ann Raimes: Grammar Troublespots: An Editing Guide for Students. New York: St. Martin's Press, 1992.   
Dave Willis: Collins Cobuild Students' Grammar (Self-study edition). London: HarperCollins, 1991.

Students may also be encouraged to seek help from language centres, writing clinics, teachers and tutors, friends and dictionaries.

# The role of the English teacher

LEAP findings show that students had grammar and vocabulary practice sometimes in Forms 6 and 7 and that the more frequent such practice, the better their overall English examination scores. They indicate a need for continuous and systematic development of students' lexical and grammatical accuracy, not necessarily through grammar and vocabulary exercises per se but through frequent revision and editing of written work. Grammar and vocabulary development should ideally be an integral part of writing and other skill activities.

The English teacher has a more well-defined role than other subject teachers in helping students with their grammar and vocabulary. The English teacher's tasks are likely to go beyond those of subject teachers in ways such as:

putting more emphasis on an approach to language development which, in addition to mere exposure, also makes systematic use of analysis, practice and interaction;   
creating contexts which stimulate students systematically to expand their linguistic resources for spoken and written communication,   
adopting a two-fold approach to the teaching of writing so that students' foreign-language proficiency and writing expertise are developed in tandem; varying the emphasis placed on different aspects of writing for different proficiency groups;   
putting more emphasis on the expansion of lexical and grammatical choices by modelling options for students;   
giving more encouragement in making appropriate word choices, improving cohesion and coherence, and exploiting a wider range of grammatical features;   
conducting more micro-level work on individual student papers in order to make students aware of more effective ways of using synonyms, antonyms and grammatical structures. Such work may involve analyses of model essays, teacher-student conferences, peer-/self-evaluation and peer-/selfediting.

# Helping students to use audio-visual media

Audio-visual media in English are very accessible in Hong Kong in forms such as English-language television, video, CD-ROMS and the Internet. In the LEAP surveys, students showed strong interest in English input from English-language television and video. This interest is understandable, since almost all of their limited exposure to English has been academic in nature (mostly through reading and writing). What is more surprising is that, according to the same surveys, students have made comparatively little use of these opportunities outside class.

One reason for this under-utilisation of the English resources available in the community may be that students do not have the opportunity or motivation to access them or have not acquired the necessary level of language proficiency. This is where English teachers play a significant role: teachers can mediate the audio-visual material for students and help them devise appropriate tasks and viewing/learning strategies. Through receiving this kind of support in class, students may be more motivated to make frequent use of audio-visual resources Outside class.

Further support and opportunities can also be provided by organising small groups in which students can share the fruits of their learning. They may also like to share their learning experiences outside class through channels such as student societies, RTHK3's Teen Time or the Internet.

There is evidence that students in Hong Kong feel a strong need for English input which is less academic than what they are mainly used to. In a survey of 540 Form 6 students, for example, Andrews and Fulliove (1993) found that students had a very clear perception of the real-life importance of everyday English skills for their future career but that the heavy emphasis on academic English failed to match these perceived needs. Boyle's (1993) survey of 100 university students in Hong Kong came to a similar conclusion and led her to argue for enhancement programmes which are less specifically geared to subject-related needs. The use of audio-visual media is one effective way of meeting students' needs for nonacademic English and, if there are also ample opportunities for students to talk in groups about what they have heard and seen, they will also be gaining valuable experience in using English for unplanned speaking.

# POLICY IMPLICATIONS

The policy implications of the LEAP findings will be presented under three main headings:

Enhancing students' English proficiency for study and for life;   
Defining the threshold level of English required for academic study;   
Stimulating a cross-disciplinary approach to learning through English.

# Enhancing students' English proficiency for study and for life

It is clear from the findings of the LEAP project that a large proportion of students experience difficulty (ranging from "some"' to "a lot") in meeting the various English language demands of academic study. This emerges unambiguously from the assessments both of the students themselves and of their teachers (see Chapter Four of this book). It is also indicated by the results of the objective tests which we conducted with smaller numbers of students (see Chapter Five).

In this respect the LEAP results confirm the "widespread agreement within the institutions that their average student's proficiency in English needs considerable improvement" (Barnes, 1996, pp. 5). This same view is expressed from a different perspective in the Education Commission Report No. 6, Consultation Document, 1995 (pp. ix): \*There is evidence to suggest that the standard of English of a sizeable number of students (about 10,000 a year) does not meet the expectations of the tertiary education institutions."

The LEAP findings thus underline the urgency of reviewing and improving the measures to enhance the English language skills that students need for academic study. They go further, however, in indicating more precisely than previous studies (e.g., by quantifying students' problems in writing) the precise areas of proficiency in which this enhancement is most needed. They thus provide the basis for more focused strategies of language enhancement which will concentrate on those areas in which it is most needed, for example,

the lexical and grammatical aspects of writing, the ability to adopt active speech roles in interactive Iearning and the ability to use everyday English in less academically-oriented settings.

Much of the responsibility for this further enhancement must clearly lie with the secondary schools. Especially in the domain of adopting active speech roles, it emerges from students' responses that many of them have not had adequate practice and not developed adequate confidence. Even in their English lessons, many students have not been exposed to an environment in which English is used consistently. There are important implications for initial and in-service teacher education which lie outside the scope of the LEAP project.

It is not uncommon for tertiary teachers to name the schools as solely responsible for any shortcomings in students' English standards. This is unjust. The responsibilities of the tertiary institutions themselves will be discussed in the sections that follow.

# Defining the threshold level of English required for university study

A major responsibility of the universities is to undertake research into the nature of the foreign-language proficiency that is required for students to cope satisfactorily with tertiary-level study. The LEAP investigations are an important step in this direction but they need to be extended with more detailed analyses of what is involved in using language for academic study (i.e., \*cognitive-academic language proficiency" as defined by Cummins; see Chapter Two).  More substantive knowledge in relation to this issue is crucial to defining a threshold level for academic study and preparing students to achieve it.

1 This may provide useful reference for admission panels or committees in universities.

Exploration of this issue should lead also to empirical investigation (probably involving both latitudinal and longitudinal studies of students' performance) of the relationship between different grades in the UE examination and the ability to cope with tertiary-level study through English. At present the grade requirements set by universities in Hong Kong reflect mainly, in a pragmatic way, the levels that institutions need to set in order to fill their places. They are not based on any investigation as to what these grades mean in terms of actual ability to cope.

The power of university entry requirements to influence students' motivation to. achieve higher levels of English is widely recognised. The Report of the Working Group on Language Proficiency (Education Commission, 1994) sees evidence of this power in the "dramatic improvement at Grade $\mathrm { D } ^ { \mathfrak { s } }$ (pp. 13) of the Use of English which followed the University of Hong Kong's decision, in 1989, to raise its entry requirement from Grade E to Grade $\bar { \mathrm { ~ D ~ } } ^ { 1 }$ . There is therefore a third link in the universities' chain of responsibility: having investigated the English proficiency required for successful academic study and related this to Use of English performance grades, they must adhere strictly to the entry requirements that they specify as a result.

The results of the investigations recommended here may also, of course, lead the HKEA to introduce amendments into the Use of English examination itself.

.... the importance of ... English study and use at university as a means of warding off the temptation to linguistic apathy, stagnation and discouragement." (Fu et al., 1993: 26)

# Stimulating a cross-disciplinary approach to learning through English at tertiary level Fp efll the sae.hp

In a survey of 982 CUHK students (Fu et al. $\cdot 1 9 9 3$ $6 3 . 5 \%$ felt that their English abilities had declined or remained the same.since entering university. The principal reason they gave was the limited number of opportunities to use English at university. These results came, of course, from a Chinese-medium university and do not necessarily reflect the situation at the English-medium institutions. They do, however, serve to emphasise the speed with which English skills can decline if they are not supported by a suitable linguistic environment.

Although we do not know of any controlled study which would illuminate the situation at the English-speaking institutions, there is informal and anecdotal evidence that they often fail to provide the English support that students need and, indeed, desire. In interviews conducted by LEAP, for example, several students expressed their disappointment at finding so few opportunities to speak English at university: in Iectures that were conducted in English they only listened, tutorials often failed to inspire confidence to express their ideas, and social norms militated against speaking English outside classes with their peers. Several students compared the situation at university unfavourably with school, where they had felt a strong stimulus to learn and often spoke English with their classmates.

The interviews which LEAP conducted with students and teachers suggest that, at present, many students see English as having low priority in their lives. It is no longer an examination subject; they are not exposed to it in daily interaction; and many university teachers adjust their expectations downwards rather than insisting on high standards. These factors combine to send the message to students that English is not very important for study or that they have met the institutional expectations when, in fact, there is evidence that many have not. Students may enter a vicious circle of apathy, decreasing standards and discouragement.

The challenge for the universities is to break this vicious circle by offering students an environment in which they feel that English plays an integral role and in which they can identify with English as a natural means for communicating ideas. Universities must develop strategies for encouraging English use as a natural part of their organisational cultures. This can only be achieved if university teachers across disciplines support students in their English by stressing more firmly the importance of English for academic study, by engaging students in the use of English in and outside class and by setting higher standards and expectations.

What emerges very clearly from the LEAP project, as well as from other studies, is that universities. cannot simply place the responsibility for students' English on their English enhancement classes. However central the role of these classes, they constitute only a small proportion of a student's total language experience at university. Universities must stimulate systematic discussion, at policy level and across all disciplines, about the role of language in learning and effective approaches to teaching students who are learning through English. The issues raised earlier in the "Pedagogic Implications' section will form a major component of this discussion; universities must accept responsibility for ensuring that such issues form a part of every university teacher's awareness.

If universities do not adopt and enforce a clear-cut policy on language, they are likely to be faced with the situation which confronts many Hong Kong secondary schools: they may become "English-medium" in name alone.

# SUMMARY

The results of our research indicate two areas of development which have implications both for English language learning and for wider aspects of students' learning.

Before students enter university, they need to experience more opportunities to develop active skills in English and to use these skills in active learning roles.

At tertiary level, everybody concerned needs to explore strategies for encouraging students to move towards more English use in active roles. These strategies include:

1. clearer communication about what is expected of students and why and the importance attached to active roles in class;   
2. encouragement to move away from socio-cultural attitudes which reinforce passive roles and silence;   
3. signals or feedback that underline the value of students' contributions rather than their incompleteness;   
4. creating space for student participation, e.g., through buzz groups and other non-threatening contexts;   
5. communicating clearly to students that lexical and grammatical proficiency is still important at tertiary level,   
6. ensuring the success of student effort, e.g, through preparation that increases students' linguistic competence, including accuracy of expression;   
7. teaching communication strategies for raising questions and participating in discussion; and   
8. clarifying interaction procedures and providing models or examples.

At the level of policy, three areas demand urgent attention:

1. enhancing students' English proficiency for study and for life,   
2. the threshold level of English required for academic study,   
3. a cross-disciplinary approach to learning through English at tertiary level.

# Conclusion

According to Bickley (1992), there have always been two dominant points of view with regard to the rationale for English-medium policies at Hong Kong's tertiary institutions. The first is that the institutions have a dual goal: both to develop students' knowledge of "content subjects" and to develop their. English proficiency for use in later life, notably in their careers. The second is that the institutions' overriding goal is to develop students knowledge of content subjects, with English proficiency only a means to acquire this content knowledge. Bickley suggests that the first view is the one that has most frequently been voiced by members of the wider Hong Kong community but that the tertiary institutions themselves have more often inclined towards the second.

The primary focus of the present study has been on students' proficiency in the English they need for academic study rather than on the English proficiency which they will need in later life. This does not mean, however, that we embrace the second view above. Rather, we see the development of English for academic study and the development of English for later life as integrally linked and, for tertiary students, functionally inseparable.

There is a developmental line, within each individual student, which leads from school to university and from university to later life. We can illustrate aspects of this developmental line from our LEAP data. It is clear, for example, that students carry a favourable disposition towards group interaction with them from school to university (and that neither institution succeeds in harnessing this disposition for learning purposes). It is also clear that students' present attitudes towards English have been affected in significant ways by their experiences at school (it would be surprising if this were not the case). These attitudes themselves contain elements which relate to their present use of English (e.g., their sense of identity) but also elements which relate to their future use (e.g., their belief that English will improve their career prospects).

While students are at university, the English which they meet and use there, whether for academic, social or transactional purposes, is the immediate and primary environmental stimulus for that stage of their language development. If that stimulus is ineffective and the developmental line goes downwards rather than upwards, students will have foregone opportunities which cannot later .be replaced by, say, a course in Business English or in English for Computer Science.  Such courses may affect students' external linguistic behaviour but not usually their. deeper cognitive and linguistic functions, which require longer periods of time for their development. If, on the other hand, students develop the capacity to think, feel and live through English (as well as their mother tongue), they will have acquired an internal resource,on which they can always draw, whether for their study, their career or their pleasure. In other words they will have extended their potential for being full participators, personally and professionally, in international and multicultural settings.

The main goal of the LEAP project has been to understand more about who the students are when they come to us. Our main hope is that this understanding will help universities to meet more successfully the challenge of providing for these students an environment in which they can continue to grow in their contentsubjects, their English and their intercultural competence.

# PART D

# Comments regarding undergraduates' English language ability

Of the 140 teachers who gave their comments in this part, many share the view that the English language ability of students vary tremendously. What they have given is a general impression of the average students. Besides a few who think that their students have acceptable English language ability, good test results or high motivation, the majority of teachers commented on the following:

# Problems

The English language ability of many students are not up to an acceptable standard. Spoken and written English; sentence structure; and vocabulary are particularly weak. Many think that the overall standard has been declining in recent years, and poor English, low motivation and lack of confidence have formed a vicious circle in students' English learning process. Many regard students' poor English language ability as an obstacle to effective teaching and learning, especially to students' taking an active role in class. Some think that problems in English are often compounded by conventional attitudes towards teacher and Iearner role.

# Causes

These problems are thought to have their roots at the primary and secondary levels, where a Iot of the teachers themselves have poor English language ability. Mixed code teaching in secondary schools and universities is thought to have contributed to poor English standards. Insufficient requirements and opportunities at university for group work in English and for clear and concise writing are also thought to be the causes of poor standards. University teachers' low expectation of students is regarded by some as a major problem in itself.

Some teachers maintain that it is often difficult to tell if poor writing/reading skills are a result of poor language skills or poor thinking or communication skills. Others point out that the main problem is not one of English, but one of Iogical thinking or communication skills such as structuring work effectively. Some students are said to rely too much on rote learning and not trust their own intellectual responses.

# Solutions

Some teachers are of the opinion that nothing much could be done about students' English language problems at university since it is then often too late. Others think that it may be more appropriate to expect "acceptable" grammar and pronunciation rather than "correct" grammar and pronunciation.

However, there are teachers who think that we should not give up but demand higher standards in general from students and give them the necessary assistance to achieve those standards.

Creating a highly risk-free and accepting classroom environment would encourage more student participation and boost their confidence in their English language ability. Also, more opportunities should be created in the classroom for group work in English.

The use of English outside class is regarded by some the key to success. Informal contexts of Iearning and training in basic skills and everyday English are also thought to be helpful.

Other suggested "remedies" include:

not lecturing in mixed code or Cantonese; learning the basics of writing simple sentences first; English taught as a foreign language rather than used as a medium of instruction; four-year university education; compulsory English language courses for undergraduates; small class tutorials and English workshops; $\bullet$ more opportunities for students to contact English speakers.

# Report on a Survey of CUHK and HKU Teachers' Perceptions of Undergraduates' English Language Ability

Ngar-Fun Liu, Christine Yu and William Littlewood June 1995

# Introduction

At the beginning of 1995, we sent you a questionnaire asking you to rate your average students' English Ianguage ability. We were delighted at the response. $^ { 1 , 0 2 0 }$ questionnaires were sent out and 437 were returned, representing a $4 3 \%$ response rate.

# Purpose of Survey

Our immediate agenda was to find out:

the degree of difficulty teachers think students encounter in various aspects of proficiency; the implicit demands made on students; features teachers consider essential for successful academic communication.

# Collaborative Questionnaire Design

We went through a lengthy period of consultation with 25 HKU teachers from various disciplines who kindly offered their insights and comments. Even though these teachers were aware of the variability in competence, they had little problem in distinguishing students who are in the middle band in terms of English language ability. The final questionnaire was a product which had gone through at least 15 drafts, and the encouraging response rate is perhaps a testimony of this collaborative effort.

# Students' Perceptions and Self-assessment

Because many of the items in the teacher survey also form part of a LEAP project questionnaire for first-year students from four universities in Hong Kong, we have been able to gather data on how students perceive various aspects of their own proficiency. So far, we have analyzed 105 out of more than 2,000 questionnaires from CU and HKU students. We think you would be interested in the results and will therefore present teachers' perceptions together with students' selfassessment in this report.

# Data Analysis

We first examined the distribution of ability ratings. (Please refer to the separate Survey Response Summary.) We then checked the differences between the ratings given by the teachers and students by applying t-tests. Next, we examined the effect of different faculties,.

ethnicity and length of teaching experience of teachers on the ability ratings by using ANOVA. We also summarized their effects by applying Duncan's pairwise comparison tests. The reliability coefficients() for the speaking, writing, listening and reading sections of this questionnaire are all over 0.91.

# Results and Discussion

# Speaking

Figure 1 shows the average rating distribution for the 10 items in this section. You can see that teachers' and students' response patterns are remarkably similar, except that students rated themselves about one point higher on all items. $t$ tests show that these rating differences are significant $( p < . 0 0 0 1 )$

![](img/1c38b4e1a31ba95c5336c74874537aba75a003f37398d66a68823decb331e31e.jpg)  
Figure 1 Teachers' and students' rating of speaking ability: A comparison

Which aspects of students' speech are considered best and worst?

The highest rating was given to items 1 and 7. This is not surprising as both denote performance under rehearsed conditions. If you compare those with items 2,

8 and 9, which represent spontaneous performance, you will see the ratings drop by almost one point. This shows that both teachers and students consider the planning aspect crucial in performance -- a view which finds support in planning and second language production research.

The lowest score, i.e., "almost unable", was given for item 5. Again, this is not surprising given the focus on formal English in Hong Kong schools and the lack of ample opportunities for using English in non-school settings.

Which two features are considered most important for successful spoken academic communication?

Table 1 Features considered important for successful spoken academic communication: A Student-Teacher ranking comparison   

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2">Communicate successfully without planning</td><td>Teacher</td><td>Student</td></tr><tr><td>1st</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>Express prepared ideas or. arguments fluently in class.</td><td>4th</td><td>1st</td></tr><tr><td>Raise appropriate questions or. comments in class</td><td>2nd</td><td>9th</td></tr></table></body></html>

You may recall that at the end of each section, you were asked to choose two items which are most important for successful academic communication. As shown in Table 1, there is not a lot of match between what teachers think important and what students think important -- teachers value impromptu speech, but students prize planned speech. What is more striking is how differently the two groups view the ability to raise appropriate questions or comments in class -- teachers see it as the second most important, whereas students see it as one of the least important. Of course, the ability to raise questions may have little to do with language ability. But this survey indicates that teachers across disciplines use the ability to raise appropriate questions or comments as one of the two most important yardsticks for measuring the success of spoken academic communication.

This finding indicates teachers and students see the role of learners very differently. Whereas teachers expect students to actively participate by raising questions and comments, students do not see the importance of their playing such an active role in the teaching and learning process.

# Are students delivering what teachers want?

As shown in Table 1, teachers think that the ability to communicate successfully without planning and the ability to raise appropriate questions or comments in class are most important, and yet according to teachers' perceptions, students have a great deal of difficulty in these two aspects of their oral proficiency (Figure 1 shows scores of just over 3), even though students do not think so. In the section titled "In-depth Interviews with Teachers", we will look at some of the reasons teachers offer for their choices and for students' difficulties.

# Writing

Figure 2 shows the average rating distribution for the 7 items in this section. Teachers' and students' response patterns are again similar, except that students rated themselves about one point higher on all items. The rating differences are significant $( p < . 0 0 0 1 )$

![](img/3fc644a0a44d202dcd8c5bce99f5d0cff2c5f5cc639c469478688b8cfb39392a.jpg)  
Figure 2 Teachers' and students' rating of writing ability: A comparison

# Which aspects of students' writing are considered best and worst?

As in speaking, both teachers and students rated lowest the ability to use idioms or colloquial expressions correctly. Grammar is a major concern as it got the second lowest rating, although that was not perceived to have seriously hindered students' ability to get their thoughts or ideas across successfully, since item 1 received the highest score. However, teachers think that students have difficulty with organizing and developing ideas when writing.

Which two features are considered most important for successful written academic communication?

Table 2 Features considered important for successful written academic communication: A Student-Teacher ranking comparison   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Teacher</td><td>Student</td></tr><tr><td>Communicate thoughts or ideas. successfully</td><td>3rd</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>Organize ideas or arguments coherently in a summary/ essay/ report/ thesis</td><td>1st</td><td>1st</td></tr><tr><td>Develop ideas or arguments in an essay/ report/ thesis.</td><td>2nd</td><td>3rd</td></tr></table></body></html>

Unlike speaking, there is a good degree of agreement between teachers and students on what features are most important for written academic communication. Both groups consider the ability to organize ideas or arguments coherently the most important.

As can be seen in Figure 2, the scores for items 5 and 6, which are considered most important by teachers, are less than 4, which means students are perceived as experiencing difficulty in these two crucial areas.

# Listening

Figure 3 shows the average rating distribution for the 6 items in this section. You can see that the scores vary less across items and are slightly higher than those for speaking and writing. Students rated themselves higher on all items than their teachers did by at least half a point on the scale. The rating differences are significant $( p <$ .0001).

![](img/b85b9bc4f125c6a760c2fcc4036089251873da4f234bc442bf409ee4f8e0d189.jpg)  
Figure 3 Teachers' & students' rating of listening ability: A comparison

# Which aspects of students' listening are considered best and worst?

Items 1 and 3 were given the highest ratings by both teachers and students. As you will see later, they were also considered by teachers to be the most important features for successful academic listening. Item 5 was rated Iowest by teachers though not by students. Does this imply some sort of communication breakdown? -- teachers may not be differentiating between what is essential and what is a casual aside, and students may be understanding but not giving the expected responses.

Which two features are considered most important for successful academic listening?

Table 3 Features considered important for successful listening in class: A Student-Teacher ranking comparison   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Teacher</td><td>Student</td></tr><tr><td>Understand spoken English delivered at normal speed in class</td><td>1st</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>Identify the main ideas(s) of lectures/</td><td>2nd</td><td>1st</td></tr></table></body></html>

As in writing, there is quite a lot of agreement between teachers and students with regard to listening, as illustrated in Table 3.

# Are students delivering what teachers want?

If you take the two items (1,3) considered by teachers as most important for successful academic listening and look at their scores in Figure 3, you will see that students are by and large meeting teachers' expectations, as these two items were rated highest by teachers, although students are perceived to have some difficulty in those areas.

# Reading

Figure 4 shows the average rating distribution for the 5 items in this section. The scores vary less across items and are slightly higher than those for speaking and writing. For the first time, students did not rate themselves higher on all items, but did so on only 3 out of 5. The differences are significant $( p < . 0 0 0 1 )$

![](img/81f810da54cbf5d3933facf50e6360f7adfa47ab8a7d82783710f19fabfd2136.jpg)  
Figure 4 Teachers' & students' rating of reading ability: A comparison

# Which aspects of students' reading are considered best and worst?

There is almost exact agreement between teachers and students for items 1 and 5, which are considered the best aspects by teachers. The biggest mismatch lies with item $4 $ teachers rated students' ability to make appropriate guesses lowest, but students did not see this as their weakest aspect. This is probably because, unless they have been told, students would not know if they have drawn the appropriate inferences or not, whereas teachers would notice inappropriate inferences being made in tutorials or written tasks.

Which two features are considered most important for successful academic reading?

Table 4 Features considered important for successful academic reading: A Student-Teacher ranking comparison   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Teacher</td><td>Student</td></tr><tr><td>Understand key vocabulary or concepts</td><td>4th</td><td>2nd</td></tr><tr><td>Identify the main idea(s)</td><td>1st</td><td>1st</td></tr><tr><td>Identiy relationsis among das c...</td><td>2nd</td><td>3rd</td></tr></table></body></html>

Again, there is quite a lot of agreement between teachers and students, although teachers consider the ability to "identify relationships among ideas" more important than students do, indicating they place more value on this higher-order skill.

# Are students delivering what teachers want?

Identifying the main ideas and relationships among ideas are considered most important for successful academic reading by teachers, but students were given a score of 4, meaning they still experience some difficulty.

First-year students in this sample consistently rated themselves significantly higher than their teachers rated them.  There are two possible reasons for this: a) freshmen's level of confidence may have been boosted by their success in gaining entry to university; b) freshmen who are weak in their English language abilities may have less knowledge and awareness to base assessment on.

# The most important skill for academic success

![](img/fe69594183be9881019487f48123cb2208aa74a405ee8183d3862b81d39421a8.jpg)  
Figure 5 Perceived importance of each skill: A Student-Teacher comparison   
Figure 5 shows that teachers consider writing most important for students' academic success, followed by reading. Speaking is thought to be the least important. Students also perceive writing and reading as the most important, but speaking is considered to be as important as listening for academic success.

# Students' confidence and motivation

If you look at Part C of the Survey Response Summary, you will see that one third of the teachers who answered this questionnaire think students are lacking in confidence or motivation.

# Ability/confidence/motivation rating according to faculty

Most differences in ability and confidence ratings among the faculties  were not significant, except that a) Education rated speaking abilities significantly higher than Social Sciences, and b) Education and Architecture rated students' confidence significantly higher than Arts.

As for motivation, Education rated students significantly higher than all other faculties. Architecture rated students' motivation significantly higher than Law, Medicine, Engineering and Science.

This higher rating of speaking abilities, confidence and motivation by Education might be a reflection of the Faculty's ethos: the value attached to student interaction in class and learning through group work.

# Ability/confidence/motivation rating according to ethnic background

HK Chinese teachers rated listening abilities significantly higher than European and American teachers. This is not surprising because students are often perceived as having greater difficulty listening to speakers from outside HK whose accents are less familiar to them.

As for motivation, European, American and Australian teachers' ratings are significantly higher than those of HK Chinese teachers. These results support the popular belief that teachers from abroad tend to perceive HK students as having high motivation. It may also be due to the fact that English is usually the only means of communication between HK students and teachers from abroad.

# Ability/confidence/motivation rating according to length of teaching experience in HK

Length of teaching experience in HK was not found to have any significant effect on teachers' ratings of students' ability and motivation. It did however affect confidence. Teachers who have less than one year's teaching experience in HK rated students' confidence significantly higher than teachers who have 10 or more years of teaching experience in HK. Perhaps the latter group are those who say they have witnessed a decline in students' English language standards and confidence in recent years.

# In-depth Interviews with Teachers

Six teachers from different departments at HKU and CUHK were interviewed. Three are HK Chinese, one mainland Chinese, one British and one American. Their years of teaching experience in HK range from less than one year to over ten. Their choices for the two most important  features for successful academic communication in each skill were the ones identified in previous sections of this report.

The views reported in this section are those which teachers expressed in the interviews.

# Reasons for most important feature choices

Speaking

1. Communicate successfully without planning One of the reasons given is that real life communication demands spontaneity; no meaningful or successful two-way communication can take place without it. This is especially the case in tutorials and seminars. The idea of an active learner contibuting to the free flow of ideas is considered especially important in the Arts and Social Sciences.

2. Raise appropriate questions or comments in class Asking questions is regarded as an essential part of learning. Learners' minds are not engaged until they start to ask questions. Raising questions and comments is also important because it provides the kind of feedback teachers desperately need in order to make teaching more effective.

# Writing

1. Organize ideas or arguments coherently Being able to organize ideas or arguments coherently is perceived as most important because the sum is greater than its parts. It is also important because it distinguishes between finely-tuned and roughly-tuned thinking.

# 2. Develop ideas or arguments

The ability to develop ideas is seen as a higher level thought process than that of organizing. It is important because without it, little reasoning, analyzing or critical thinking can take place.

# Listening

1. Understand spoken English delivered at normal speed in class   
2. Identify the main ideas

# Reading

1. Identify the main ideas   
2. Identify relationships among ideas

These features are most important for successful academic listening or reading because they are regarded as prerequisites for it. Identifying the main ideas is also a prerequisite for further analysis, i.e., examining relationships among ideas.

# Causes of students' English language difficulties

During the interviews, many reasons were cited for students' difficulties, especially in the areas identified by teachers as most important for academic communication. (See also Part D of the Survey Response Summary.)

Schooling, and in particular language education in HK, is regarded as by far the biggest culprit; it has produced students who lack basic competence in English after 13 years of studying it in school. The education system has also failed to engage students in an active mode of learning, in asking questions and in critical thinking, all of which are essential for learning at university. Some say cultural attitudes towards the role of teacher and learner are a major contributing factor, while others say huge class size is. It is thought that in order to overcome these deficiencies, the system must attract, train and retain the brightest to be language teachers, reduce class size, and adopt more effective teaching approaches.

Other reasons outlined include insufficient exposure to English language media and inadequate opportunities for using English outside class; general decline of standards with the expansion of education; and insufficient targeting of academic skills (e.g., writing) in university English courses.

# What can teachers do to help students?

Some teachers say the last thing university teachers should do is to give up and lower their expectations of and demands on students, because such attitudes and behaviour would only create a vicious circle.

Other comments are related to what teachers in primary and secondary schools and what parents can do to motivate students' learning of English. It is also said that more resources for English language teaching should be put into schools.

# Summary of Findings

Teachers in this sample consistently rated students   
significantly lower than students rated themselves.   
In the perceptions of the majority of teachers who   
responded to this questionnaire, the average HK   
undergraduate has difficulty in using English for   
successful academic communication.   
Teachers perceive students' reading and listening   
abilities to be better than their speaking and writing   
abilities, and not surprisingly, both teachers and   
students consider reading and writing more   
important than listening and speaking for academic   
Success.   
Teachers consider students capable, though with   
some difficulty, in speaking under rehearsed   
conditions, but handicapped in spontaneous   
speaking.   
Teachers and students disagree fundamentally about   
the most important component for successful spoken communication; the former value spontaneous speech, the latter planned speech. With regard to the more frequently exercised or academically relevant skills such as reading and writing, teachers and students' perceptions of what features are most important for successful academic communication are similar. In reading and writing, teachers value higher-order abilities most, namely: identifying relationships among ideas, organizing and developing ideas. Teachers think that the major causes of students' English language problems are poor language education at primary and secondary levels, insufficient practice opportunities in class and inadequate exposure to English outside class.

# Teacher Expectations

One of the findings that has emerged from teachers' comments is that some of them perceive a high correlation between their expectations and demands and students' English language ability. This is consistent with the widely accepted educational philosophy that students will perform well if teachers have high expectations of them.

Therefore, a recommended practice would be to make clear to students what is expected of them and why, and then encourage them to seek help when they find it difficult to meet those expectations.  For example, instead of acceding to students' requests that classes be conducted in Cantonese, teachers could first seek ways of increasing the support which they give students.

# Supportive classroom environment

Support can come in the form of encouragement and overall language preparation. For lectures, we could encourage prior preparation of key vocabulary and think more carefully about the kind of background information essential for students' comprehension of a topic or concept. We could produce clearer diction and more varied ways of presentation, punctuate lectures with small group work, provide lecture notes with blanks and clearer signalling of main points and new content (e.g., through visuals, intonation, emphasis, pauses and gestures). We could digress less and signal more clearly what is important and less important information.

We also need to give special attention to assuring that our lectures are tightly and explicitly organized, and whenever possible, closely related to assigned readings. We could make sure that we Iecture at a speech rate that allows students enough processing time. Comprehension may also be helped by frequent checking, either by us or by students themselves. Small groups and short exercises or questions could be used for this purpose.

Support for written work could be given in the form of sample essays or reports written in good English. Students could do summaries of their readings in small groups before they embark on an independent piece of work. We could also give students detailed assessment guidelines on English language. (This should be separate from other assessment criteria such as comprehensive coverage of relevant literature and critical analysis). For students who still have difficulty with English sentence structure, teachers could recommend books which deal with this (e.g., Raimes, A. 1992. Exploring Through Writing.) or encourage them to seek help.

# Attitudes towards learner role

One of the most important findings from our teacherstudent ability rating comparison is their different perceptions of the role of the learner in the teaching/learning process. There appears to be a need for teachers to convince students to unlearn ingrained attitudes and behaviour, such as seeing the teacher as an authoritative source of expert knowledge who should not be challenged, not speaking English in front of your peers, and not answering the teacher voluntarily in English. Teachers could induct students, especially freshmen, in the rationale for adopting an active role in learning at university and guide them in appreciating, e.g., the purpose of student questions and comments. Once students are clear about what is expected of them and why, teachers could encourage learners to adopt a more active role and even make learner involvement one of the criteria for assessment, which should have a positive washback effect.

# Buzz groups

One way of gently easing students into a more active role is using small, well-timed discussion groups of no more than six students for various purposes such as brainstorming for questions and comments, clarification of concepts, and critical feedback. Buzz groups break the monotony of the usual question-answer-feedback pattern and present less "risk" to students. They allow for greater learner participation and responsibility, more practice opportunities, and a more supportive learning environment. Teachers could also get the feedback they need in a short round-up session where students report their ideas for the whole class.

# Communication strategies and language gambits

Buzz groups may get students more involved in the teaching/learning process. But research has shown that, when using English, students tend not to adopt communication strategies which they would normally use when they use their mother tongue. This could seriously reduce the effectiveness of buzz groups. Is there then a case for reminding our students of the kinds of strategies (e.g., "repair' strategies, turn-taking, verbal/non-verbal feedback) needed for successful spoken communication? In some cases, there may even be a need for teaching specific language for doing these things. For example, some students may need to be taught the language of clarification and circumlocution in English.

# Designing tasks for success

After 13 years of English learning and in some cases seven years of English-medium education, HK students have amassed a body of knowledge about the English language. Given time, patience, understanding and encouragement, they would be able to make active use of that knowledge for very successful academic communication.

Two critical factors in this transition from knowledge to active use are practice opportunity and confidence. Carefully structured group work which requires the use of English in a low risk environment and successful task outcomes would boost students' confidence in the language.

The University of Hong Kong is carrying out a survey named LEAP (Learning Experience, Attitudes and Proficiency), a research project conducted by the English Centre of HKU, which aims at finding out the learning experience, attitudes and proficiency of secondary and tertiary students.

We would like students (from Form 4 to Form 7) to answer the questions below and send them back to us as soon as possible. Please address your reply to LEAP Survey, Young Post, 5/F Morning Post Building, Tong Chong Street, Quarry Bay, Hong Kong.

Results and Analyses of Vocabulary and Writing Tests

The purpose of the vocabulary test is to find out whether you have enough vocabulary for reading general and academic texts. It is estimated that you need to know at Ieast 65% of the words at the three levels in order to read both types of texts without struggling with too many unfamiliar words. A low level of knowledge at the 5th 1,000 level is common among Hong Kong students, whose learning of English has been through reading formal texts rather than informal texts and conversational interaction.

You know $7 0 \%$ of words at the 3rd 1,000 word level.   
You know $2 9 \%$ of words at the 5th 1,000 word level.   
You know $61 \%$ of words at the UWL.

The purpose of the essay test is to examine your productive vocabulary, grammar and usage. Productive vocabulary is measured by the number of word families and the % of non basic words used in your essay, i.e., the $\%$ of words used that are beyond the 2,00o most common words. The higher the number and $\%$ , the richer the vocabulary used, which also implies a larger vocabulary size. Grammar and usage are measured by the number of error-free clauses and error-free complex sentences.

These measures, though indicative of the overall quality of writing, are not comprehensive because effective communication also requires appropriate content, organisation, coherence, style, etc.

Richness of productive vocabulary

In the first 300 words of your essay, there are 138 word families, and $1 0 . 8 \%$ of the words are beyond the first 2,000 most frequently used word families.

# Grammar and usage

About 4 of your 35 clauses are presented grammatically using appropriate words and expressions, i., $1 1 \%$ are error-free. In this short essay, you have produced seven structurally complex sentences, each containing two or more embedded clauses. However, they are not error-free.

A breakdown of the errors in terms of number and types is given below.

# UE Grade A student

Thirdly, if parents are allowed to choose the sex of their future child, there might be a possibility that one sex dominates in a family or even the whole society. If a child was born whose sex was chosen by the parents, the parents might pay more attention to one particular child and ignore the needs of other children in the family. It would not be mentally healthy for the children which might even hinder their psychological development.

Afterall, we must ask ourselves whether anyone should be given the right to play God and upset the natural balance. Our ancestors have never been given the right to choose our sexes and there seems to be no sound reason that we could violate the laws of nature. Therefore, parents should not be allowed to choose the sex of their children and nobody should be.

# UE Grade C student

Nowadays, in Hong Kong, most parents do not choose the sex of their future child. It may be due to high medical expenses. However, in my opinion, even if the expenses become lower and lower, parents should not be allowed to choose the sex of their future child because of the following grounds.

To begin with, the population pyramid may be disturbed and may be in chaos. Such phenomenon becomes worse in China as Chinese tradition has the belief that males are "superior" than females because males are much more productive in agriculture and females is the financial burden in the family. As a result, when parents are allowed to choose the sex of the future child, there will be a tremendous increase in the number of the males in the future which cause many social problems. For example, the marriage, the job opportunities, the population balance etc.

# UE Grade D student

There is another problem of parents choose the sex of their future child through sex selection technology. It is dangerous and the world will surely towards the end. We all believe that the technology in this century is very powerful, we can eat the mix of apple and pear. So we can also deduct that there will be a more powerful technology such as "character selection, knowledge selection?. If these are in reality, there is a question evolve. Do the parents' have the right to infrige the rights of children? How about the people in " this world"? Is it human make human but not God?

All in all, sex is the gift that given by the God. Although the sex selection technology somehow can fulfill the mind of parents, but they all are only maximize their individual benefit, not the world. They neglect the harmony relationship between man and woman.

# UE Grade E student

As I think, the population balance between male and female should be kept. If most parent want the boy, we can see the result is that our next generation will have more male and less female. Such situation can lead to a series problem, e.g. marriage problem, human resource redistribution. Of course, all of us do not want to see such scence happening in our future. Even more, the ethics will be changed greatly if the number of male is much more than female. The position of female in the society will become less respectful and most function of our society will be controlled by man. So, in order to maintain a healthy and balance community, the first thing we need to do is to maintain the balance of man and woman. One more thing, we really want to keep a normal and healthy relationship between the sexes and I hope that we needn't see the sexual discrimination happening in our surrounding again.

# UE Grade E student

On the other hand, sex selection is not nature. According to biological theory, human reproduction is nature and the sex of their offspring is nature, too. Human cannot effect this nature theory. Furthermore, this nature theory control the population balance and keep the ecology system.

I think son and daughter are also the parents offsprings, that is their love product after marriage. The need love them samely. So I do not know the difference between boys or girls that they are the same.

A very important point of sex selection technology with genetic method. Although the sex selection may run at now, it have lots of problem about technique that the parents chose one sex of their future child but the outcome is not.

It has been po nted out that L2 writing studies which use objective measures are remarkable for their lack of umiformity and definitions of terms such as "error-free", and this makes comparisons difficult (Ishikawa, 1995). Correctness can be strictly defined as correct with respect to discourse, vocabulary, grammar, style, spelling and punctuation. For example, a clause that is correct in isolation can be incorrect if it does not fit its context completely.

However, LEAP decided not to take into account discourse elements such as connectives, in order to enhance the objectivity of the error-free clause measure. For example, no correctness judgments have to be made regarding sentences that begin with and, but, so when these words are not included in the clause. More importantly, the widespread overuse of some connectives by HK students would certainly obscure the error-free clause count if they were included. They are instead considered when errors are classified (see Error Types in Appendix 11).

# Error-free

Error-free was therefore defined as correct with respect to vocabulary, grammar, style and to a lesser extent, discourse. Errors in connectives, spelling (unless they involve grammatical markers such as plurals), punctuation and capitalisation are disregarded. However, errors in pro-forms (e.g., pronouns) are not because they are grammatical rather than logical cohesive devices. A clause is not error-free if there is one or more instance of inappropriate usage. In the examples of students' writing cited below, only 1 and 2 are error-free. The underlined parts are where errors occur. Some of the errors may not be apparent because of the absence of their discourse contexts.

In sum, LEAP's definition of correctness takes into account discourse elements, except connectives. which straddle clause and sentence boundaries. Such a definition of correctness is adopted for two reasons. The widespread misuse of connectives, as mentioned earlier, is one. The other is that LEAP uses the error-free clause to assess students' ability to manipulate the basic components of a clausal structure, and this requires a finer distinction to be drawn between the clause level and the discourse level.

# Clause

Similar to the definition given by Chalker and Weiner (1994) in the Oxford Dictionary of English Grammar, a clause is defined here as a string of words which has a visible subject and a complete verb phrase put together in standard English word order. It may or may not express a complete idea. Logical cohesive devices such as and, while, but, are ignored. In the following examples, clause boundaries are marked by a slash and errors by underlining.

# Examples from students' writing

1. Mastering a new language is difficult, but challenging./   
2. Mastering a new language is difficult,/ but it is challenging.!   
3. But in here, there is a problem.1   
4. Based on this traditional concept, the parents in China will tend to have a boy./   
5. To avoid such tragedy happening again, my point of view is/ that the sex of the baby should   
not be chosen by their parents.!   
6. I hope/ we need not see the sexual discrimination happening in our surrounding again.!   
7. As I think, / the population balance between male and female should be kept./   
8. There are various conditions, both economical and moral,/ that needs to be considered./   
9.  It does not mean correct/ by just depend on/ what we like./

The advantage of the clause analysis is that it takes care of multiple co-ordination, over- or underpunctuation and long units. It splits the data into small enough units, which enables a more accurate count of error-free clauses. Furthermore, it does away with the problem of the definition of a main or subordinate clause.

But there are still problems which require judgment on the part of the researcher. The first is that of phrases (or non-finite, subjectless and verbless clauses in some modern grammar, e.g., Quirk et al., 1985). In this analysis, the clause may at times include what traditional grammar regards as non-clausal structures such as those in bold type in examples 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8. These structures were included as part of a clause because trial analyses revealed that although shorter word strings may enable more clause and error counts, the present categorisation already discriminates between students of different proficiency levels. It is therefore not necessary to split word strings further. Also, in some instances, clause and sentence are coterminous, as can be seen in examples 1, 3, and 4.

The second problem concerns determining where one unit ends and another begins, even when capitalisation, punctuation and connectives are ignored. This problem is prevalent in the writing of low-proficiency students. The last example illustrates this difficulty -- the second unit is not a clause because it does not have a subject. (The writer might have meant "what you want may not be morally acceptable".) These word strings are considered as clauses even if a verb or subject is lacking. In other words, the original definition of a clause is expanded to deal with stretches of low-proficiency writing that do not seem to conform to any clause patterns. Example 9 would then be analysed as if there were three clauses. Of course, this approach does take away some of the objectivity of the clause measure. But the advantage is that it leaves no chunks unanalysed, thereby making the analysis more rigorous and accurate.

# Complex sentence

A further auxiliary measure -- the complex sentence -- was also used. A complex sentence is defined here as one that contains at least two subordinate clauses. This is because adopting the traditional definition of a complex sentence using one subordinate clause would make the measure too similar to or not much larger than the clause. Subordination is defined according to Quirk et al. (1985) and it includes adverbial, nominal, relative, non-finite and verbless clauses. Examples 1, 2, 4. 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 all contain at least one subordinate clause, but only 4, 5 and 6 contain two. The error-free complex sentence was meant to be a secondary measure because it suffers similar problems to those of the T-unit. It may be less objective than the error-free clause as it calls for more judgment on the part of the researcher.

No claim is made about the objectivity of the grouping, which developed out of the errors found in the piece oi jargumentative writing students did. It is hypothesised that different genres and communicative purposes, etc., will affect the types of errors that may be made. For example, it is not likely that tense errors will be common in a piece of argumentative writing.

# Lexical errors

Inappropriate use of discourse connectives such as besides, furthermore, then, however, so, therefore, in fact , on the whole, actually, more importantly, etc. Inappropriate use or lack of content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs), e.g., side effects instead of effects, variety will be declined instead of variety will be reduced, stay at the old concept instead of hang on to old traditions, the strength of deciding instead of the right to decide, etc.

When the distinction between lexical and non-lexical errors is blurred, a narrow definition of lexical knowledge was applied. This means one may know the meaning of lexical items without knowing how to use the rules that operate on Iexical co-occurence. For example, parents are responsible education is interpreted as an omission of a preposition rather than a lexical error resulting from a lack of knowledge of the collocation of responsible.

# Grammatical errors

Errors in word order.   
Lack of an appropriate subject, verb or complement in a clause.   
Clauses whose meaning is unclear in the context in which they appear, e.g., but it is not just as simple as a choice, as all human rights.are basically from nature, or nothing is never happened.   
Lack of agreement between two or more elements in a clause or sentence; not taking the same grammatical person, number, or gender.   
Inappropriate use or lack of articles, prepositions, parts of speech, tenses and passives.

# Unclassifiable errors

About $5 \%$ of errors do not clearly fall into the two categories. They were ignored. For example, this sounds to be a good idea can be interpreted as a lexical error -- not knowing the collocation of sound -- or as a structural error -- lack of an appropriate complement.

Similar error classification difficulties apply to the following clauses -- there seems to be no sound reason that we could violate the laws of nature, or someone has found a way that we can chose the sex of our future children.

# Students fight English stutter

Hong Kong students know that English is important for studies and career, yet they hesitate to use it. DENISE CHEUNG reports

S according to a-survey of Young Post readers.

Over 40 per cent of students said they "should lcarn or use English well", but many said it made them feel anxious and nervous.

The survey, conducted in January. in Young Post, was part ofthe LEAP project (Learning Experience and Proficiency) carried out by the English Centre of the University of Hong Kong. The project received responses from 355 Form Four to Seven students from 44 schools in Hong Kong.

Most respondents agreed upon the present and future importance of English in Hong Kong, and regarded learning the international language significant for their studies and future. work.

Despite their high motivation and enthusiasm for learning the language, a considerable number of respon-. dents showed lack of faith in their English proficiency, and hesitated to use the language confidently.

Over-30 per cent said they felt "anxious and nervous", and about 25 per cent of the students said they felt "unnatural and seif-conscious" when using English.

Some 20 per cent reported that they even felt panic and fear, and'. over 10 per cent said they wanted to avoid using it.

Nevertheless, about 25 per cent of the respondents held the opposite .opinion, saying they felt \*happy and. excited" to use the language. Over 15 per cent considered It an achievement to use English, and over 10 per cent felt "comfortable and confident".

In response to questions on their learning experience, students reported that listening to teachers was the most frequent in-class activity, followed by group discussions and reading books and newspaper articles.

However, grammar excrcises, which were not viewed as a regular class activity, were ranked as the most useful in-class activity to improve English.

![](img/10e2bc1c917bfc3e2bbc8b3520738c41870a0cf9990279465b478513679a5406.jpg)  
All ears .: . listoning to teachers is the most frequent in-class activity. The picture shows an English activity session held at Belllios Girls' Schoo!

Most respondents disliked copying, memorising and dictation as they found these activities neither useful .nor enjoyable.

Project work, drana, role-playing, songs and games are very popular in class but ranked as the least useful activities.

Reading newspapers, was rated as a frequent, useful and enjoyable activity both in and outside the class.

Students also spent a considerable time learning the language through watching movies and ielevision programmes and lisiening to English .songs.

Many students also found reading books and keeping a vocabulary notebook usefut ways to raise their English language ability.

Activities such as interviewing foreigners, having foreign friends, and visiting foreign families and international schools were some of the popuIar ideas suggested.

Writing news commentary and journals, organising newspaper quizzes, book reading schemes, making pen-pals wcre also listed as interesting activities for improving written English.

# Class pointers for language teachers

THE following issues are addressed in the LEAP report.

How much classroom time should be allocated to teacher talk and student talk? Should teachers think more carefully about why they talk?

# Intensive English courses for English-medium students in S6 and 7 (pp. ix)

"There is evidence to suggest that the standard of English of a sizeable number of students (about 10,000 a year) does not meet the expectations of the tertiary education institutions." Does this number refer to the average $36 \%$ (out of about 26,000 Use of English exam. candidates each year) who obtain grade E? If so, LEAP findings' on the vocabulary and writing profile of grade-E first-year university students provide supporting evidence.

LEAP student survey also shows that E-grade students' mean composite rating of speaking is 3.6, of writing 3.8, on a scale of 1-6, indicating they experience a lot of difficulty in these areas.  (Listening 4.2, reading 4.3) ' If these results were considered with those of the LEAP teacher survey, which shows that first-year students rate their English proficiency significantly higher than their lecturers do on all items, then E-grade students' proficiency may be lower. Their vocabulary profile suggests they are struggling with many unfamiliar words in their academic reading.

# Adherence to language entrance requirements (pp. xi, 48)

This recommendation does not go far enough to address the issue of language proficiency of university students, especially in view of the evidence that "a sizeable number of students (about 10,000 a year) does not meet the expectations of the tertiary education institutions." How about an exit examination? (Universities in the PRC have exit exam. in English.) Not only will it establish targets, it will send the right message to students as regards the importance of English. LEAP student interview data show that English is at present a low priority for university students partly because it is no longer an examination subject. The message being sent to them is that they have met the institutional expectations, but in fact some of them have not.

We need more research data to show the nature of the language proficiency that is required for students to cope satisfactorily with tertiary-level study. At present it is not true to state (2.9) that "the nature of the English language proficiency required is clear" (the Report itself contradicts this statement in 2.28 and on pp. 34).

We also need empirical exploration of the relationship between different grades in the Use of English exam. and the ability to cope with tertiary-level study through English. The grade requirements set out in Table 2.1 reflect the pragmatic facts as to what levels institutions need to set in order to fill their places. They are not, however, based on any investigation as to what these grades mean in terms of actual ability to cope.

A further factor requiring attention at tertiary level is the institutions' internal language policies. There is ample "hear-say" evidence that the use of English vs. Cantonese for tutorials and lectures is haphazard. There is also a lack of systematic discussion about the most effective approaches to teaching students who are learning through a second language.

# Language across the curriculum in schools

There is no lack of evidence (Cheung, 1984 & Lai, 1991 cited in Annex 1B) to show that the language demands of subject textbooks are unrealistic for as many as $1 5 \%$ of the students entering "English-medium" secondary schools.  Report # 6 fails to point out that even with the best qualified English teachers in the world, students' English standards are not likely to improve if they find their textbooks in other subject areas incomprehensible. The need to set realistic language standards for all subject textbooks in English is urgent, and textbooks written in appropriate language should be regarded as one of the necessary conditions for effective learning in English.

The report mentions the need to upgrade the English proficiency of teachers of subjects other than English. -In view of the crucial importance of this factor in determining whether a medium of instruction policy can operate, however, the report needs to highlight it even more emphatically. If the English proficiency of teachers is limited, they must either adopt a transmission approach in which the learners' roles are limited or resort to interacting with the students through Cantonese.

# Starting age for learning English formally (pp. 43-44)

Report cautiously point out that if the conditions and support for effective learning and teaching of English are not there, changing the starting age is not likely to lead to improved outcomes. It then recommends that further research be conducted to ascertain what the optimal starting age is. This recommendation cannot be a logical conclusion that follows from the cautious note, which implies that starting age is not as important as other factors. Given the strong parental desire for an early start, surely the priority should be to make sure that the favourable conditions and support are set up. Only then can meaningful research into the optimal starting age be conducted.  We feel very strongly that resources should first be directed to generating these favourable conditions and support before the search for an optimal starting age.

# Public perception and community participation (pp. xix, 58)

LEAP findings indicate that opportunities for using English is a major factor affecting confidence and proficiency and "society's attitudes to English use" rank third. out of six possible factors influencing English language ability. These are similar to those found by the commissioned perception survey. There is an urgent need for a large-scale community-based campaign to encourage English use in everyday communication and use of resources from the community as stated under "Language goals and language development" (pp. xiv).

# SCOLAR (pp. vii, 47)

One of the major tasks of the proposed SCOLAR is to suggest specific attainment targets at each stage of education. But it seems that the ED's curricular guides as well as the present examinations (HKCEE and HKASL) have already established these targets to some extent.. Perhaps what needs to be looked at is how realistic these targets are and for which group and whether different targets need'to be set for different groups.  At university level, the LEAP teacher survey, first-year students' vocabulary and writing profiles could be useful for establishing targets.

ciuded:

3 sams.e of 2.5s first-year students in four universities in Hong Kong and 330 students in three universities in the Feopie's Repuolic of China gave detailed information about their Engiish ianguage experience in Forms 6 and 7, their attitudes towards English and English learning, and their perceptions of their own proficiency in domains of language use which are important for academic study;

questionnaires in which a sample of 437 teachers in two Hong Kong universities reported their perceptions of students' English proficiency in these same domains of language use; in-depth interviews in which the perceptions of students and teachers were explored further; tests to obtain samples of performance in writing and measure students' proficiency in the use of grammar and vocabulary.

The book provides valuable insights for all who are involved in the upper secondary and tertiary education of students in Hong Kong as well as in other educational settings where learning takes place through the medium of a second or foreign language.
