Linguistic features used to highlight findings, concepts, ideas, and their significance are ubiquitous in academic writing. In the present exploratory study, we investigate how novice writers (L1 and L2 English) and expert writers use formulaic discontinuous sequences for highlighting purposes; we also look at the extent to which there are differences in use of these across five academic registers. Through a bottom-up approach, we identified five discontinuous sequences that were particularly productive for highlighting purposes: it is \* to (e.g., it is interesting to), it is \* that (e.g., it is clear that), the \* of the (e.g., the importance of the), the \* that (e.g., the fact that), and one of the \* (e.g., one of the major). While the novice writers largely depend on the same discontinuous sequences as the experts, they tend to rely more heavily on a limited set of fillers (i.e., lexical items that go in the open slots). Only minor differences across registers were noted, which sug. gests that highlighting strategies play an important part in all registers investigated. It is hoped that results from this study can help novice writers extend their linguistic repertoire and inform future research on highlighting strategies.

# 1. Introduction

Writing is dialogical in that i rquires the writer to help the reader rganize, interpret and evaluate [..] content (Hinkel, 2005, p. 368). One part of this dialogue is the highlighting of select findings and claims to help focus readers' attention. To do so, academic writers have a range of linguistic highlighting strategies at their disposal. We define a highlighting strategy as a means of calling attention to a finding, clam, or issue raised. That i, constructions ofthis kind help authors draw attention to something that they wish to focus readers attention on. An example f such a strategy is the author's use of it is imperative to (in bold) or one of the finest to highlight the subsequent statement in Examples (1) and (2), respectively. Many of these highlighting strategies can be thought of as discontinuous sequences with a variable slot (e.g., it is \* to or one of the \* in the examples below).

(1) It is imperative to prevent a recurrence of the quadrupling of the crude oil prices (expert E-GU-v1-55_utf16le)

(2) The NHS has one of the finest data banks in the world (expert_ E-IN-060114-1_utf16le)

The present exploratory study aims to (i) investigate high-frequency discontinuous sequences used for highlighting purposes by academic writers - novice (L1 and L2 English) and expert - and (i) carry out asystematic investigation of these across registers, as outlined in more detail below.

The use of highlighting devices of diffrent kinds has been found to be challenging for novice writers and learners in particular, which is unfortunate given their ubiquity in academic writing. For example, we note reports in the literature of overreliance and misuse compared to native speakers and expert writers. Comparing the writing of L1 German students to L1 English students, Lorenz (1998) found (i) that learners tended to use more adjectival intensification constructions such as cruciall important and very dficult and (i) that the German students use these in places \*where they were semanticlly incompatible, communicatively unecessary, or syntactically undesirable" (p. 64). Furthermore, in a study of amplifiers, Yaoyu and Lei (2011) reported that L1 Chinese doctoral students tended to make more frequent use of totall, very, and relly than their native English peaker (NEs) counterpart, and that they used the amplifier entirely and highly les frequently. Similarly, Wu and Tissari (2021) found that 1 Chinese learners produce more intensifier-verb collocations than their NES peers, in particular just $^ +$ verb, only $^ +$ verb, and really $^ +$ verb.

Previous studies have also reported a more limited array of highlighting strategies in novice writing compared with expert writing. Specificall, analyses of lexical items associated with highlighting strategies have shown that learner writing tends to be charactrized by a more restricted lexical repertoire compared with expert and native speaker writing. For example, Hinkel (2005) reported that native speakers employed a much wider range of intensification devices in their academic essays compared to the larners. Similarly, Larsson and ri (2019), in their study f adjective-erb paig in subjet extraosition (itis \*o\* g is mortnt t rememer) noted that leaners "tended to use thir most frequent pairings more frequently than the experts used theirs' (p. 46). Preferences ofthis kind in novice writing were also reported in Hassegard (2019a) and described as an overreliance on "phraseological teddy bears" (from Hassegren's, 1994, useof"lexical teddy bears). However, developmental L2 writing studies such as Garner (2016) and Tan and Romer (2022) show that the teddy-bear effct" starts to fade away as ners become more proficient i ther 2; that is, leaners start using more varied fillers t complete discontinuous formulaic sequences such as the \*of theas they become more proficient in their L2.

In terms of lexical preferences in the context of highlighting strategies, one word stands out as being particularly frequently used by novice writers, namely important. Multiple studies have shown how novice writers, and learners in particular, cling to constructions involving the adjective important. For example, Granger and Larsson (2021) found heavy reliance on different versions of the lexical bundle the most important thing in the learner data from multipleL1 backgrounds than in the expert data. Similar findings were reported by Larsson (2019a) who compared the use of stance constructions in apprentice and expert writing and found an over-reliance on constructions that had a boosting function, especially those including the lexeme important, in the novice data. Larsson and Katari (2019) also found that the preference for subject extraposition constructions that include important was particularly strong in learner writing. However, previous studies do not show a flly uniform picture: In a study looking at the \*of the \*patten in novice writig, the NES were found to use importance among the top-10 lemmas for the first open slot, whereas it did not feature in the learners list t all (Hasselgard, 2019b).

In addition to the importance of analyzing the individual lexical items associated with highlighting stategies, some previous studies have also found that such strategies tend to be distributed differently across registers (i., culturally recognized varieties of language; Biber & onrad, 2019. Larsson (2019a) showed that constructions such as it s possile that and it i likely that were trongly associated with expert academic writing, whereas single-word advers (e.g., posibly) were most strongly associated with conversation. In the same study, Larsson also compared learner academic writing to various expert registers and found that learners use of stance markers shared some similarities with the popular science and news registers in adition to academic writing, suggesting certain lack f register awareness on the part f the leaners. In gneral, the efect f riser i stil an understdd ae in rearch on  English (though see Goulart, 2021; Biber, Gray, Staples, & Egbert, 2020; Larsson, Paquot, & Biber, 2021, for some notable exceptions).

Taken together, the findings of previous studies highlight the need for not only examining the frequencies of highlighting strategies, but also their lexical profile. However, while multiplestudies have noted an overreliance on highlighting strategie nd more limited lexical preerces in novice writing, thee studes doot offer much infomation about what strates and ingistic resource expert writers employ instead, nor do we have much data on the extent to which highlighting strategies may be register-specific.

Methodologically, as reported above, the topic of highlighting strategie can be approached from both a single-word (e.g., Yaoyu & Lei, 2011) and a phraseological perspective (e.g., Hasselgard, 2019b). The lattr includes methods such as lexical bundes and phrase frames (P-frames). Unlike lexical bundes (g., Biber, Johansson, Lech, Conrad, & inegan, 199, p. 990-1024), P-frames allow for open slots in the bundes, such that while it i interesting to, i is important o, and it i nesary to would have been counted as three separate bundles, the P-frame it is \* to combines the three into one entry (see, e.g., Cunningham, 2017; Fletcher, 2012; Renouf & Sinclair, 1991; Romer, 2010; and Tan & Romer, 202). Studies of this kind have, for example, provided important insights into the processof L2 learners development of phraseological ompetence and shown that leaners tend to move toward les predictable, more varied phraseological units (e.g, Garner, 2016; Tan & Romer, 2022). Most previous studies using one of these techniques for phraseological studie of language tend to generate a list ofall the phraseological units (bunde or -frames, respectively) in a corpus and then proceed to further analyze or classify these into, for example, functional categories. In the present study, we instead combine techniques commonly applied to single-word studies (where a small set of lingustic items are selected for further, detaled analysis) with a phraseological approach, focusing on a smal set of phraseological units: in our case, high-frequency discontinuous sequences used for highlighting purposes. That is, this project combines a formulaic approach to analyzing highlighting strategies and a discourse-based perspective on the usage pattern of these discontinuous sequences (see Gray & Biber, 2013).

Specifically, the current study looks at a selection of high-frequency discontinuous sequences used for highlighting purposes by novice writers (NES and learners) and expert writer. Given the exploratory nature of the project, we employ a bottom-up approach (outlined in ection 2.2) that resulted in the identification of fie such sequences that are commonly use for highlighting puroes tis $^ { \ast } t o$ (e., is inintois \* ti c ht, the \*f th the i f th, th \*tt . h  tt,  n the \* (e.g., one of the major). The distribution of these was compared across (a) learner, NES, and expert writing and (b) five registers: essays, methodology recounts, case studies, explanations, and critiques/evaluations. We applied a strict sampling method that resulted in balanced subsets from each register, as outlined in Section 2.1. The following research questions were investigated to guide the analysis:

What high-frequency discontinuous sequences are used by novice (learner and NES students) and expert writers to highlight ideas. concepts and results in their writing?   
: To what extent are such highlighting strategies register-specific?

# 2. Corpora and methods

In this section, we begin by describing the corpora and sampling method used in Section 2.1, followed by an overview of how the highlighting strategies were identified and analyzed in Section 2.2.

# 2.1. Corpora

To build subsets of data that were as comparable as possible across the groups in terms f register make-up and size, we compiled subcorpora from five different corpora: the Academic Learner Writing corpus (ALW), the British Academic Written Englis corpus (BAWE), Critique/Evaluation (CE), The Multilingual Editorial Corpus (MULT-ED), and the Corpus of Discourse in Scientific American English (CODISAE).

For the novice writing, we used texts from the five academic registers included in ALW and BAWE: esay, methodology recount, case study, explanation, and critique/evaluation. The texts in thesay category present a coherent argument and include texts that are either more informative i.e, demonstrating subject knowledge without taking a ide) or more argumentative in nature i., taking a position and arguing for and against it). Methodology recounts describe disciplinary procedures and methods employed by the author. Case studies are descriptions/accounts of a particular case, rather than of a general topic. Explanations provide  general overview of a process or objec of study, such as a species/breed overview or legislation overview. Critique/evaluations evaluate and asess the significance of a procesor object of study. For further information on the range of texts included in these registers, se Nesi and Gardner (2012) for BAwE and Biber, Reppen, and Staples (2017) for ALW.

ALW is a subcorpus of disciplinary writing collcted from learners in English medium universtie in the US, with a large number of first-language (L1) backgrounds represented. The largest L1 group in this corpus is Chinese and German, followed by Greek, and Vietnamese; a more detailed account of tis corpus can be found in Biber et al. (2017). The full BAWE corpus contains texts written by university students at four British universities (for further details e Nesi & Gardner, 2012). Only NES texts were xtracted from BAWE and included in the present study.

In order to match the expert corpora to the novice corpora as closely as possble, we looked at texts from each subcorpus to determine possible candidate corpora. We identified three corpora of expert writing that, while not identical to the novice registers were deemed sufficiently similar: CE, MULT-ED, and CODIsAE. CE comprises book reviews published in academic journals on a range of different topics is compiled by Tony Berber Sardinha at the Sao Paulo Catholic Universty; the novice writing equivalent to this corpus iscitique/evaluations. The full MuLr-ED corpus comprie newspaper editorials in a range of different language, including English, Swedish, and French (se https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/ilc/cecl/mult-ed.html for more information). For the present study, only the English subcorpus was used. The counterpart to this corpus in the novice data isesays. Finally, cODISAE comprises the methods sections from peer reviewed indexed scientific journals from PLos ONE compiled by Ana Bocorny at theFederal University of Rio Grande do Sul using AntCorGen (Anthony, 2019). The novice writing equivalent of this corpus is methodology re. counts. However, despite our efforts to find expert registers that are as comparable as possble to the novice corpus, there are un. avoidable differences between the groups, for example, with regard to situational characterisics such as audience, resulting in some inevitable caveats regarding the comparisons across novice and expert writing. This also impacts what conclusions can be drawn from the comparisons, which is a point we will return to in the subsequent sections.

We applied astrict sampling method that resulted in proportionall balanced subsets from each register to ensure that the corpora are as similar as possible in terms of their register make-up. Specificlly, in order to be able to retain as many texts as possible, we modeled the relative size of the novice subcorpora on our smallest corpus, the ALW corpus, from which we selected the registers that have a counterpart in BAwE. We then applied random sampling from the expert corporato match their relative size. While this enables us to control for factors that have been found to be of importance, such as corpus size and register (Reppen & Olson, 2020), it means that the registers are not represented equally in our study. Our largest subcorpus contains esays, which accounted for approximately 60 percent of the texts in each novice corpus, and the remaining four registers each accounted for approximately 10 percent. As the expert corpus i imted t thr rester as opposed  five in the novice data), the relaive ize of the subcorpora corresponds to those of the novice data with the registers case study and explanation taken out. An overview of the size, level, and register make-up of each corpus can be found in Table 1.

# 2.2. Methods

In order to identify highlighting strategies used by the novice and expert writers, we employed a bottom-up approach to identify frequent discontinuous sequences (henceforth frames) with a variable slot (Gray & Biber, 2013). First, Wordmith Toos (Scot, 2016) was used to search for frequent frames with variable slots. These frames (e.g., it is $^ { * } t o ,$ the \* that) are an effective first step toward identifying highlighting strategies. Ulike lexical bundes (e.g., Biber e a., 199, p. 990-1024), frames with variable slots allow for open slot inhe ude. Fr ple th frm is \*o ifie ) wt \*ler  nsing, t, ny) g in the pen slot, and (ii) the frequency with which they appear there.

The five most frquent frames that had the pottial of being used as highlighting trateies were itis\* tht e., iis clear that) itis \* to (e.g, it is esentil to), the \*f the (.g., the imporce of), the \* that , the fact that), and one of the \* ., one of the main.

The next step involved manual analysis of all 8207 tokens (frames $^ +$ all fillers) that had been extracted automatically with the purpose of identifying which of these tokens actuall functioned as highlighting strategies and discarding the remaining tokens. The results sections exclusively cover tokens used for highlighting purposes. Examples of tokens from the t is \* to frame that were not considered highlighting straegies and thus excluded from the analysis included tokens such as it isthre to and it is going to. Another example of excluded tokens are instances from the \*f th frame used to describe an attribute of someone or something ., the heat of the oven, se Hasselgard, 2019b and Sinclair, 191, p. 88-89, for a more detaled discussion of such uses). That is, not al tokens that share the same frame can be considered highlighting strategies, which mean that there isan interplay between the frames and the lexical items in the fillers that together makes the token function as a highlighting strategy.

As the manual investigation inevitably entaled a certain degree f subjective judgement, we took the following measures: the first and second authors coded the lis separately, and we then asessed our inter-rater reliaility (IRR) using ohen's kappa on a subset of 100 tokens from the data se, e.g., Larsson, Paquot, & Plonsky, 2020). For this intial IRR, we had \*moderate agreement on Landis and Koch's (1977) scale (Cohen's kappa score: 0.56, $z = 6 . 0 3 $ . We then discussed the tokens where we disagreed and then went back to the main dataset to recode those tokens. We then ran a second test of IRR on adifferent subset of 100 tokens, and this time we reached "almost perfect agreement" (Cohen's kappa score: 0.91; $z = 9 . 0 1 $ , which we deemed sufficiently high for our purposes. Nonetheless, we both went through th fullist of tokens to resolve any remaining disagrement; th reult of this step was a final lis of 111 valid highlighting tokens included for further analysis. These tokens were analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively, as outined in Section 3.1. For example, we employed Multiple Correspondence Analysis to identify and graphically represent underlying patterns in the data acros registers in an exploratory manner. This technique enabled us to plot the data on a two-dimensional plane, where the degree of similarity among variables is indicated by their distance (e.g., Baayen, 2008); more information about this technique is provided in Section 3.2.

# 3. Results and discussion

Section 3.1 provides an exploratory overview of what high-frequency frames novice (learner and NES students) and expert writers employ for highlighting purposes. Section 3.2 presents a discussion on the extent to which the highlighting strategies are registerspecific.

# 3.1. An overview of highlighting strategies in novice and expert writing

In total, we identified 2111 instances of highlighting strategies as expressed through one of the five frames. The breakdown of the raw and relative frequencies across each frame per subcorpus can be found in Table 2. As can be recalled from Section 2.1, whilethe novice corpora each comprise balanced subsets of all five registers investigated, the expert corpus does not include case study and explanation. To se if this might have affected the novice-expert comparison unduly, we ran a separate analysis comparing the novice data to the expert data wth these two reisters excluded from the novice data, and this analysis did not yield any notable differences in terms of the relative frequencies. Rister differences, to the extent they exist, thus do not appear to reside in the relative frequencies across the frames. We willtherefore proceed with these samples in the present section and comment further on register in ection3.2.

Table 2 Frequencies across each frame per subcorpus.   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Learner Raw (percent of total)</td><td>NES student Raw (percent of total)</td><td>Expert Raw (percent of total)</td></tr><tr><td>it is * that</td><td>120 (15.7%)</td><td>125 (16.3%)</td><td>88 (15.2%)</td></tr><tr><td>it is * to</td><td>164 (21.4%)</td><td>160 (20.9%)</td><td>103 (17.8%)</td></tr><tr><td>one of the *</td><td>111 (14.5%)</td><td>111 (14.5%)</td><td>107 (18.5%)</td></tr><tr><td>the * of the</td><td>141 (18.4%)</td><td>97 (12.6%)</td><td>85 (14.7%)</td></tr><tr><td>the * that</td><td>229 (29.9%)</td><td>274 (35.7%)</td><td>196 (33.9%)</td></tr><tr><td>TOTAL</td><td>765 (100%)</td><td>767 (100%)</td><td>579 (100%)</td></tr></table></body></html>

We can see that all three groups (i.e., learner, NES, and expert writing) frequently use the five highlighting frames identified through the bottom-up approach described in Section 2.2. Although the general pattern of use in terms of relative frequencies is relatively similar across the goups,cein differes can still be found. For example, hileth \*tha s th most frquent frame n all three subcorora, the \*f the is th lest freuent frame in the  dat and thexpert data, hile on f the \*s the lst frquent frame in the learner data. In addition, although the novice writers (the learners and NES students) exhibit exceptionally simila overall frequencies for the irs thre frames, we can see  weaker preference for the \* that and lightly stronger preference for the \*f the in the learner data than in the NES data. Examples of these two frames can be found in (3) and (4); an instance of the \* of the produced by an expert writer can be found in (5) for comparison.

(5) David Blunkett made much of the gravity of the issue and rebuked the Tories [..]. (expert MULT-ED_E-DT-310304-1)

To get a clearer sense of what types of strategies the different groups employed, we willnow look more closely at what fller i. the word that fils the gap in ach frame the writers use to se what strategies are used by the different goups. The three most frequent fillers in the learner writing, the NES student writing, and the expert writing can be found in Table 3.

Comparing the novice writers i.e., learner and NES) to the expert writers while keeping in mind possile ssues related to comparability across the novice and expert groups, we can se that (i) like previous studies have noted (eg, Hinkel, 205; Wu & Tissari, 2021), the lners exhiit les variety in that they relied more havily on the top thee fllers than the expert witers, and (i) that while there certainly is overlap between the groups in terms of the three mostfrequent fillers the novice writers make more frequent use of important it is important to) and importance (the importance of the), similar to findings in studiesuch as Granger and Larsson (2021) and Larsson (2019a).

With regard to the first observation, while the proportional preference never goes above 40 percent in the expert data, the fact that makes up 60.9 percent i the NES student data and no les than 72.5 percent in the learner data n addition, one of the most makes up

We thus seem to beseeing some evidence of a preference for phraseological/lexico-grammatical teddy bears (se Hasselgard, 2019a; Larsson, 2019b) in the novice data, where the bulk of the frequencies is made up of a limited number of tokens. onetheles, the roportional preference for most in the frame one of the \*i stronger in the expert data than in the NS student data, which shows that patterns of strong preference can also be found in the expert data.

When it comes to the leaners frequent use of te illers mortant and imortance in it is \*to and the \*of the frames, a closer lok at the surrounding context of these frames shows that the learners use these for several purposes. I is important to, which is always followed by a verb, is primarily used to draw reader atention to an important point in the line of argumentation, as in (9), or to give readers advice on what to pay attention to in future studies, as in (10), or to highlight a limitation in their own work, as in (11).

A closer look at the novice and the expert data shows that these functions are present in these data as well just that the bundes themselves are les frequent than in the novice data overall he diferences among the groups thus appear to be more quantittive than qualitative - that is a matter of degree, not kind.

We will now ook more cosely at the possible impact f register on thedistribution of the highlighting trategies investigated. As we shall se further down, he registr differences noted proved to be les about overal frequencies and more about lexical preferenes. Fig. 1 provides an overview of the normalize frame (token) frequencies per text and per 10,000 words across the different registers and groups for al frames. As can be recalld from Section 2.1, the learner and NES student subcorpora are matched in terms of what registers are incuded (essa, case study, critique, explanation, and methodology paper), whereas the expert sucorpus comprise texts equivalent to essays,critiques, and methodology papers (though see Section 2.1 for a discussion of possible ssues related to comparabilit across novice and expert registers), but no case studies or explanations. The boxplots show the dispersion of frames across the texts for each register. The box marks the intequartile range, the horizontal ine in the middle of the box marks the median, and the red cross marks the mean. The dots above the whiskers mark outliers.

As s shown in the figure, there are only very minor dfferences among the registers in terms of the mean number of frames used per text. With regard to differences acros the groups, we can note that the range is particularly wide in the experts esays, and that the median is  in the expert writing for both methodology recounts and esays, meaning that half of the texs did not contain any frames of the kind investigated in the present study. By contrast, ll of the novice essays and the vast majorit of the methodology recounts contained at least one frame.

A closer look at the data showed that to the extent there are register differences, these appear to be lexical. In order to detect and further investigate patterns across the registers, we ran a Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA). MCA i a multivariate technique used for exploratory investigations of categorical data. The data are plotted on a two-dimensional plane where the distance indicates degree of similarity between variables. The closer two variables are plotted to one another, the stronger the association between them (see e.g., Baayen, 2008, p. 128 Glynn, 2014). The MCA (Fig. 2) wasfitted onto the data using R (R Core Team, 2022) and the package FactoMineR (Le, Jose, & Huso, 2008). The groups (expert, lerner, NES student writing) and the frames are displayed in red, whereas the fillers are shown in blue.

Fig. 2. Multiple correspondence analysis of group, register, frame, and fillers.

A separate script written to identify the relative contribution of variables to each dimension (se the Appendix) showed that differences on imensio (the horizontal axis) were primarily de to varying profile with repect to the frames itis \*that, the \*f the it is $^ { * } t o ,$ and the \* that and their illers, whereas differences on Dimension 2 the vertical axis) can primarily be explained by varying profiles with regard to the frame one of the \* and its associated fillers.

Before we lok at ifferences and similaritie across the groups, however, a few obserations deserve mention. Overall thre of the frames - it is $^ { * } t o ,$ the \* that, and one of the \*- exhibit particularly strong preferences for a limited number of fillers; the frames and fillers that are most strongly assciated with one another are as follows: t is important to, the fact/idea that, and one of the most. For the rmaining two frames -t is \*tht and the \*f th - a larr selectin of fllers i listd: expected reommnded, assumed, o, clear, vident, likl, nt, ous, true, and estil for the fer, nd me, power, majrit, im, rbility, sicance, mpact, intst s efivs, s, us, de,  nonivit or th r. his sgs th the n e fr is more lexically diverse than the first set, which we also saw in Table 3 in Section 3.1 above.

With all the variables taken into consideration, we see that there are both diferences and similarities across registers and groups. For example, while the essays all group relatively closely together and the learner and NES student case studies are in the same quadrant, the citiques from the the different groups are spread out across three different quadrants. Furthermore, the learners methodology recounts are different from those f the other two which are in the same quadrant. Fially, the learners explanations are in opposing quadrants from those f the NES students. With regard to lexicaldifferences, we se that the frequencies of individual fillers when divided into registers are generally relatively low (with raw frequencies ranging from 1 to 124). Nonetheles, we have sufficiely stable freuncie for eran flers to nte, for exmple, tht the preferecor th frame-fier cmination itis mortant to is sronger in the essays than in the other registers, with the learners showing a particularly strong preference: expert writers (18.4 pmw) $<$ NES students (53.8 pmw) $<$ learners (106.0 pmw).

# 4. Concluding discussion

The present study has mapped out some of the most frequent frames used for highlighting purposes by academic writers (novice and expert) and investgated their use acrossacademic registers. The most productive frames used for this purpose in our data wereitis $^ { * } t o$ (e., i into ist  c tt, h\* f th  he, th\*t thftt,  the \* (e.g., one of the major). The frame the \* that i the most frequent one for all thre groups (leaners, NES students, and expert writers. With regard to the filler words that occupy the empty slot in these frames, it is \* to, the $\ast$ that, and one of the \* show a strong preference for a limt nmer fillers, whers the mnng tw frme- t is \*that andthe \*f th- takelargr eection f fllers. With regard todiffernces across groups, we saw that the experts generally exhibit greater variety in use f illers than the novice writers, which is in line with previous research comparing leaner writing to expert writing or comparing learner writing across proficiency levels (e.g, Garner, 2016; Hinkel, 2005; Tan & Romer, 2022; Wu & Tissari, 2021). For the \* that frame, single lexical item (fact) made up 60.9 percent and 72.5 percent of the cases in the NES and learner data, espectively, whereas the relative frequencies for th illers never went above 40 percent in the expert data. We also confirmed the results of previous studies showing that novice writers, in particular lners, tend to rely hevily on constructions including important r mportance e, itis importn to; the mportance f the) Whereas the expert writr relied more on other fller-frame combinations, such as one of the most and th fact that. Only very minor differenc wee ntd among the risters in tms f oral frquencie, ad thediffence ntd apar t be prmarily lexical.The three groups are most similar in their usage in the essays, and somewhat less similar in the critique/evaluations.

This study adds to an ever-growing number of corpus-based studies highlighting the fact that language is highly patterned (e., Paquot & Granger, 2012). That is, while we certainly need to further investigate the functional profiles of single words, formulaic sequences of diffrent kinds deserve continued attention. For highlighting strategies specificall, our results indicate that studies of individual lexical items can only take us so far. For example, the overreliance on the adjective important noted in previous studies only provides a partil picture, in tha t often occurs as par f formulaic sequence (e.g. itis important to - asequence that may in tu e overused (or underused) by learners. In taking a phraseological approach to the study of functional category (highlighting strategies) we hope to encourage more studies loking at (a) other functional categorie nd (b) other phraseological sequences - discontinuous or continuous - used for highlighting purposes.

In addition, although based on a limited number of discontinuous sequences, the results in the present study led us to conclude that learners may benefit from some explicit instruction of highlighting strategies. Potential applications of the results include classroom activitie that can help novice writers () become aware ofthe ubiquitous use of highlighting frames in expert writing, i) identif the various flers that can be used in such frames, and i) use these frames in their own writing. For example, to rase awareness of highlighting straeies, novice writer can be given alist of the frames analyzed in ths study and asked o identify constructions of this kind in expert writing such as published artice or textbooks. Looking at authentic texts willikel help students become familiar with the frequency and dispersion of such strategie. After identifying the highlighting frames used by experts, the students can group the frames that only differed with respect to their fllers and examine their use in context. At this stage, it would be important to direct students attention to the variet of filler used in expert writing, especially considering that the findings of the preent study indicate that novice writers could benefit from instruction that can help them diversfy the fllers they use. As a final te,students can examine Whether they used any of the identified frames in their own writig and, if so, what filles they used with these frames. Instructors could direct students attention to the possible overuse of important as afiller because the present study (as wellas previous research) indicate that mportant is alexical teddy bear for many novice writers. Additional activitie could include illin-the-blank actvities in which students pick appropriate fllers to complete given highlighting frames. Such an activity would expose students to a variety of fillers, hlping them expand thir repertoire. Teachers may also want to consider introducing altenative highlighting strategies (i., other linguistic patterns) in addition to having students work with variants of productive discontinuous sequences.

While we hope that this overview can provide helpful for future studies on the topic, we recognize that it is not without limitations. Specificall, future studies may want to use larger corpora and a larger selection of sequences to be able to explore possble lexical differences further and return to the question of what expert corpora can be considered comparable to the learner corpora. Future studies may also want to lok at extralinguistic variables such as discipline, first-language background of the learners, and regional differences (., ritish Englishvs. American English), none of which were possible o addressin the present study given the material to which we had access. Nonetheless, the present study is an initial step toward describing highlighting strategies as a category of lexico-grammatical constructions used by academic writers.
