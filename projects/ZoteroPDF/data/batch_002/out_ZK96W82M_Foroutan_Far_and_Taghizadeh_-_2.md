# ABSTRACT

This study investigated the effects of digital and non-digital gamification on EFL learners’ learning collocations, satisfaction, perceptions, and sense of flow. The participants divided into three groups of digitally gamified, non-digitally gamified, and non-gamified classes were 75 Iranian EFL students at B1 level. In each class, students were divided into two teams and received the treatment. The data collection instruments included a pretest and a posttest of collocation knowledge, the flow questionnaire, three open-ended questions, and a semi-structured interview. The results of ANCOVA revealed significant improvement in the collocation knowledge of the three groups. The results of an ANOVA revealed significant differences in the collocation posttest scores of digital and non-digital groups compared to that of non-gamified group. Additionally, both gamified groups were satisfied with using gamification for learning collocations, because they believed the class was highly competitive, encouraging them to collaborate and learn in teams. Both groups also had positive perceptions of implementing gamification for learning collocations, which included competition, teamwork, and challenging and fun learning environment. The results indicated that students of both gamified groups considerably experienced the sense of flow because their skills matched the challenges of the games, and they were absorbed in the games. This study recommends that EFL teachers implement gamification as an effective tool to tap into learners’ emotions and to engage them in learning English collocations.

# Introduction

Along with various technological advancements, digital games made their appearance in the 1970s and were quickly regarded by educators as potential learning tools, which led instructional technologists and educational theorists to start to examine the connections between learning and games more directly (Jones, 1982, as cited in Reinhardt, 2018). Meskill (1990, as cited in Reinhardt, 2018) notes that games are tremendously motivating and can be highly effective tools for group learning if complemented with the right kinds of materials. Gamification, which is the concern of this study, can be used to facilitate the process of language learning for digital-native language learners and as one of the most enjoyable, effective methods of language learning (Lui, 2014; Munday, 2016; Sundqvist & Wikstrom, 2015). Plass et  al. (2019) define gamification as the addition of specific game characteristics, such as reward systems and narrative structures to a non-game environment to make it more motivating. They further state that gamification involves adding encouraging elements, such as stars, points, achievements, or rankings to persuade learners to put more effort into doing a rather dull and unengaging task while the task itself remains mainly the same. Regarding types of games, Yaccob and Yunus (2019) assert that language games are of two types, namely digital and non-digital games. Digital language games can be defined as the integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in a language game (Xu et  al., 2020). According to Prensky (2007), digital games include key factors, including goals, outcomes, entertainment, challenge, interaction, and competition. For example, some inexpensive language learning applications, such as Babbel, DuoLingo, LingQ, Livemocha, and Busuu have come into use as game-based applications for language learning. These games consist of gamification mechanics, including points, badge systems, and leveling in their design, which are sometimes combined with social networking mechanics. On the other hand, Maloney (2019) defines non-digital language games as traditional games that do not require the use of ICT. Maloney further states that these games can be an excellent way to practice skills and can be conducted anywhere with minimum costs. As stated by Zainuddin et  al. (2020), using gamified instruction in a low-tech information environment can be an alternative strategy to digital gamified classes. Kapp (2014) also notes that gamification neither is dependent on technology nor has to be digital.

Several studies have investigated the effects of gamification and game-based learning on vocabulary learning. What almost all have in common is that they have been exclusively concerned with applying digital games or digital-gamified activities to examine the potential of games for vocabulary learning and improving learners’ motivation and perceptions. In recent years, only few studies (e.g. Ling & Mohamad, 2018; Sahathevan & Yamat, 2020) have investigated the use of non-digital language games in enhancing sentence construction. Nonetheless, there seems to be very few studies (e.g. Amer, 2014; Rasti-Behbahani & Shahbazi, 2020) examining the impact of gamification on learning collocations, which is an integral part of vocabulary learning. This study aims to use the potential power of games and game mechanics to compare the effectiveness of digital and non-digital gamified activities for learning English collocations. It is also argued that gamified language learning can improve learners’ satisfaction, perceived learning, and flow experience (Li et  al., 2021). The effects of gamification on these variables are also investigated in the current study.

# Review of related literature

# Underpinning theories

Various terms are adopted to describe using games in the field of language learning; however, game-based learning and gamification are the most applicable terms to this study. While game-based learning aims to obtain educational goals by the use of actual games, gamification specifically concerns the use of some game design elements to enhance engagement and motivation in any context, whether it would be educational or not (Deterding et al., 2011). According to Israel and Alexander (2017), to teach a specific skill or to meet a specific goal, game-based learning gives learners the opportunity to become immersed in learning by integrating actual games in this process, whereas gamification is implemented by applying game-based approaches and mechanics to a non-game activity to promote learners’ participation and motivation. Given various learning theories underlying gamification, Zainuddin et  al. (2020) list twenty-three learning theories and models. Behaviorism, cognitivism, constructivism, zone of proximal development (ZPD), intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, self-determination theory (SDT), self-efficacy, and flow theory are some of the most important theories explained below.

Gamification is related to the idea of behaviorism in that it is being applied as a strategy to modify students’ learning behavior (Oliveira & Bittencourt, 2019). Reinhardt (2019) states that a behaviorism-informed approach to gameful learning deals with the idea that repeated exposure to certain words or structures in a game, whether the player is conscious of them or not, would help with their learning. He also argues that players would learn through rewards or penalties they receive. Oliveira and Bittencourt, however, note that the central idea of gamification is bound up with the idea of Piaget’s cognitivism. Reinhardt states that a psycho-cognitive approach to game-based learning suggests that players learn games through experimenting and deducing, helping them devise, employ, and test out various strategies to actively engage with the game narratives. Oliveira and Bittencourt also argue that gamification can be closely related to constructivism in that it provides a way for learners to construct knowledge, learn out of their experiences, and take the responsibility of their own learning.

Given ZPD as another theory underlying gamification, Rachels and Rockinson-Szapkiw (2018) argue that while scaffolding can be traditionally provided by a peer or teacher, technological advancements enable technological tools to provide scaffolding. They further state that gamification systems and educational games are no exception and can be designed to scaffold learners within their ZPD. The immediate feedback, continual challenge, and opportunity to deal with higher challenges are all factors, which make games enjoyable (McGonigal, 2011). In addition, SDT is known to be the most common psychological theory underlying the theoretical framework of gamification (Seaborn & Fels, 2015). SDT is a macro-theory, which can explain the internal motivation humans have for performing a task or an activity as opposed to the external motivation driven from the theory of operant conditioning (Ryan & Deci, 2000). Ryan et  al. (2006) found that competence and perceived autonomy are connected with changes in well-being, preferences, game enjoyment, and sense of presence or involvement participants felt in their gameplay experience.

It is argued that there are four ways individuals can foster self-efficacy: master experiences, social persuasion, vicarious experiences, and emotional and physiological states (Bandura, 1995). According to Rachels and Rockinson-Szapkiw (2018), gamification is found to involve all of the above-mentioned elements needed to positively influence self-efficacy. Rachels and Rockinson-Szapkiw also argue that in gamification, when players see that others have accomplished a task (e.g. a higher rank or level), they tend to consider the task attainable, leading to increase in their self-efficacy. Rachels and Rockinson-Szapkiw argue that the stressful environment of traditional foreign language classrooms and the anxiety it brings about can be reduced by gamification apps as learners can use a device to communicate rather than talk in front of the class.

Having considered flow theory as another theory underpinning gamification, Csikszentmihalyi (2008) used the term ‘flow’ to refer to the optimal experience individuals can have when they are involved in meaningful work in which they tend to be very engaged, indicate high levels of enjoyment, and lose track of time. Csikszentmihalyi (2014) notes that flow indicates the holistic feeling we experience when we act with total involvement and that the most common form of experiencing flow is through playing games. Rachels and Rockinson-Szapkiw (2018) argue that gamification includes elements that make up flow. Csikszentmihalyi (2014) also states that for a task to foster the flow experience, the following dimensions are required: centering of attention, merging awareness and action, control of environment and action, loss of ego, demands for clear feedback and action, and autotelic nature of flow.

According to Admiraal et  al. (2011), for a person to experience the flow state, there should be a balance between the level of challenge and the person’s ability to perform a task. When a player is engrossed in a game, they tend to forget the concept of self under the effect of awareness (Chen, 2007). This satisfying experience is referred to as loss of self-consciousness (Csikszentmihalyi, 1991). It is also found that game players lose track of time when they are engaged in the games (Wood et al., 2007), which is referred to as transformation of time (Csikszentmihalyi, 1991). According to Rachels and Rockinson-Szapkiw (2018), creating autotelic activity is the last element of flow, which is doing the experience for its own sake. They argue that games have such characteristics as they are played for feeling enjoyment and as an end in themselves.

Regarding students’ perceptions of and attitudes toward the use of gamification as a tool in language learning, several studies have reported that learners’ general perceptions of gamification are positive and learners are of the opinion that with gamification students have fun and enjoy the lessons that they previously disliked and it can be used in all fields (Bicen & Kocakoyun, 2018). Gamification can also encourage learners to be fully-motivated, exerting positive effect on vocabulary acquisition, retention, learners’ motivation, and perceptions (Huang et  al., 2010). It is also found that mobile game-based English vocabulary learning contributes to higher effectiveness, satisfaction, and positive perception (Chen et  al., 2019). Having studied students’ perceptions at game strategies at a course in higher education, Alexander (2017) indicated that students were exposed to game mechanics in various ways; however, they could still benefit from the strategies.

Although gamification has been proved to be engaging and motivating in many ways, there are a number of criticisms levelled at it, which need to be taken into account. For instance, some critiques state that gamification can become ‘exploitationware’ with counterfeit rather than genuine incentives (Bogost, 2011). Gamification in education can also become exploitative if it is considered an excuse for a simplistic design of learning (Rughiniş, 2013). To reduce long-term negative effects gamification might have, Nicholson (2012) argues that gamification can be designed without external rewards; for instance, gamification can be designed to give students more autonomy by letting them choose their own goals or making their own decisions about the constraints of the educational context. Moreover, gamification for activities learners might find boring is not a risk, since there is little intrinsic motivation to initiate such activities (Deci et  al., 2001). In this study, digital and non-digital gamification is used for teaching collocations, which are reviewed in the next section. In addition, rather than comparing gamification effects on learning collocations in its two different types, students’ performance in digital and non-digital groups is also compared with that of non-gamified group to identify the effect of gamification on learning collocations as a whole.

# Definition and importance of collocations

Nunan (2015) defines collocations as the words often used before or after a word that we need to know about. Nesselhauf (2005) states that collocations or arbitrarily fixed word combinations, such as make a decision and strong tea, are a group of expressions whose significance in language has been discerned in recent years. According to Nesselhauf and Tschichold (2002), multi-word expressions, including phrasal verbs, collocations, compounds, and formulae, which are integral parts of a native speaker’s linguistic knowledge and probably even more frequent than simple lexemes, make difficulties for language learners. Collocations are not only of crucial importance in language production and comprehension, but they also indicate an L2 learner’s overall language proficiency (Men, 2017). Given learners’ communicative competence, their fluency is a distinct advantage, which can be enhanced by multi-word units (Nesselhauf & Tschichold, 2002). Nesselhauf and Tschichold further state that although learners with no implicit knowledge of multi-word units can produce comprehensible input, they cannot obtain native-like language production, making it difficult for interlocutors to understand them. Teaching multi-word units and collocations therefore seems to be obviously acknowledged by applied linguistics community, as they are not likely to be learnt automatically (Lewis, 2000).

Having studied language learners’ use of a mobile application for learning collocations and idioms, Amer (2014) underscored the significance of providing learners with sources and materials to help them learn collocations and idiomatic expressions. Amer also found that learners revealed positive attitudes toward using mobile technology in improving language learning. In a more recent study, Rasti-Behbahani and Shahbazi (2020) examined the impact of a digital game-based vocabulary learning task on improving learning some components of a word knowledge framework, including learning collocations. They found that learners in the experimental group gained both productive and receptive knowledge of various aspects of target words more effectively than their counterparts in the control group. They also found that the digital game-based vocabulary learning task could enhance learning the productive-recognition of form-meaning effectively.

In the fields of gamification and game-based language learning, digital environments or platforms have been used in various studies (e.g. Chen et  al., 2019; Li et  al., 2021; Rasti-Behbahani & Shahbazi, 2020; Waluyo & Bucol, 2021; Wu & Huang, 2017). There have also been some studies (e.g. Ling & Mohamad, 2018; Sahathevan & Yamat, 2020) on the use of non-digital language games in enhancing sentence construction. However, it seems the potentials of non-digital games for vocabulary learning in general and for collocations in specific have been neglected, which is particularly significant when it comes to language learning in low-tech settings. The current study aimed at building upon the above-mentioned studies but differed from all in that it explored the effects of both digital and non-digital gamification on learning English collocations. Considering the theories and studies reviewed, it is hypothesized that gamification may have the potential to be implemented in both digital and non-digital forms to enhance language learners’ collocation knowledge and to modify their perceptions of and satisfaction with the use of gamification for learning collocation. Therefore, the following research questions were addressed:

1. Is there any statistically significant difference in the collocation knowledge of three groups of students who learn English collocations using digitally gamified, non-digitally gamified, and non-gamified traditional approaches?   
2. Are students of digitally and non-digitally gamified classes satisfied with using gamification for learning English collocations?   
3. What are students’ perceptions of the use of gamification for learning English collocations?   
4. Is there any statistically significant difference in the sense of flow experienced by students of digitally and non-digitally gamified classes?

# Method

# Participants

Seventy-five Iranian EFL students at the B1 CEFR level were chosen from among the students attending the general English classes at Jahad-Daneshgahi Language Institute, Isfahan, Iran. They were randomly assigned to digital gamified $( n = 2 5 )$ , non-digital gamified $( n = 2 5 )$ , and non-gamified groups $( n = 2 5 )$ ). In each group, participants were then randomly divided into two teams to receive the treatment. The sample included both boys and girls ranging in age from 14 to 17 years old with an average of 15.5 years, among whom 45 $( 6 0 \% )$ were male and 30 $( 4 0 \% )$ were female students. It is also worth noting that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, class sizes were limited to 12–13 students, and materials were delivered face-to-face.

# Instruments

The instruments included pre- and posttests of collocation, the flow theory questionnaire, three open-ended questions on the sense of flow (Appendix A), and a semi-structured interview with two questions on learners’ satisfaction and perceptions (Appendix B). To evaluate learners’ knowledge of collocations, a multiple-choice test with 32 items covering eight target topics (i.e. books and movies, weather, sports, character and behavior 1 & 2, friendship, family, and music) was developed by the researchers (Appendix C). The items of the test were designed using English Collocations in Use- Intermediate (O’Dell & McCarthy, 2017). Authentic example sentences were also taken from either the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English or other valid Online Dictionaries, including Cambridge Dictionary.

The Flow State Questionnaire of the Positive Psychology Lab (PPL-FSQ) developed by Magyaródi et  al. (2013) was used to determine the extent to which learners experienced the sense of flow while being engaged in the gamified activities. PPL-FSQ was a five-point Likert scale with 20 items. The questionnaire was composed of two subscales of balance between challenges and skills (11 items) and absorption in the games (9 items). In addition to the flow questionnaire, three open-ended questions in line with the two subscales of the flow questionnaire were also developed by the researchers. In other words, the open-ended questions were about the level of engagement in the games, losing track of time and place while being engaged in the games, and the match between challenges of the games and the skills. To investigate satisfaction with and perceptions of using gamification for learning English collocations by students of both digital and non-digital groups, a semi-structured interview with two questions was also conducted.

# Game mechanics

Gamification was implemented by adding game mechanics to gamify activities. The game mechanics included points, badges, leaderboard, progress bar, bonus cards, and a final award. Each of these game mechanics is explained in details below. According to Zichermann and Cunningham (2011), no matter what your preconception of points is, they are an absolute requirement for all gamified systems. Hence, for both digital and non-digital groups, a number of points were allocated to each activity. For instance, for each collocation matched correctly in the Definition Matching game, teams could earn one point. To record the points collected by each team in each session, the Microsoft Application Game Scoreboard was used for both groups (Appendix D). Badges are an excellent way to encourage social promotion and to mark the completion of goals and the steady progress of play within the system (Zichermann & Cunningham, 2011). In this study, badges were used to mark the achievement of a specific number of points by teams. For example, bronze badge was used to mark the accomplishment of 50 points, silver badge for the accomplishment of 150 points, and the gold badge for 250 points (Appendix E). For the digital group the badges were given to each team on the class’s WhatsApp group; while these badges were printed on cards for the non-digital group.

Simply put, the purpose of a leaderboard is to make simple comparisons (Zichermann & Cunningham, 2011). The leaderboard was designed to show the ranking of teams based on their collected points. The leaderboard for the non-digital group was designed and printed on a cardboard (Appendix F). At the end of each week, students of each team and the instructor updated the points for each team on the leaderboard and then ranked the names of the teams. For the digital group, however, the leaderboard was designed in the Microsoft Word Software, updated by the instructor and shared with teams on their WhatsApp group after each session of the treatment (Appendix G). The digital group could also see the automatic leaderboard during the gamified activities they had on the application of Quizizz (Appendix H).

Progress bars are used to indicate the progress each team makes and how close they are to complete a task (Zichermann & Cunningham, 2011). In this study, the progress bar designed for both groups consisted of four milestones for the teams to achieve (Appendix I). Each milestone was reached when teams thought they could remember and use the collocations of the previous week. For instance, the first milestone was reached when teams thought they could remember and use the collocations from the first two sessions. The ultimate goal was reached in the last week when teams thought they could remember and use the collocations from all the previous sessions. Bonus cards were also used to reward learners when they could perform an activity perfectly. For the non-digital group, bonus was designed on cards (Appendix J), while for the digital group bonus cards were designed in the BookWidgets software (Appendix K). Bonus cards included virtual currency, which could be used to buy extra time for the games. They also included two cards named ‘The Exclusive Gem’, if drawn by any team, could double the points they gained in the game.

# Gamified activities

The gamified activities designed for both digital and non-digital groups included Brainstorming, Definition Matching, Parts Matching, Snap, and Guess Which Collocation. Moreover, the same activities were designed for the non-gamified group except that they were not gamified. To gamify the activities for learning English collocations, the first step was considering the type of knowledge of learning collocations. Learning English collocations involving both memorization and association between two or more words can be considered declarative knowledge, also known as verbal or factual knowledge. Kapp (2012) asserts that several types of gamification mechanics and techniques can be used to teach declarative knowledge. For teaching declarative knowledge, he discusses elaboration (i.e. the process of linking new information with prior relevant or even irrelevant information to show learners the context of new learning content and to connect it to a known structure); organization (i.e. placing new learning content into logical groups, such as tables, diagrams, lists, models, and even mnemonics); association (i.e. linking a word to an image or a term to its definition); and repetition (i.e. repeating the content over and over to memorize it). Kapp states that translating these techniques into game mechanics can be fruitful in terms of both the motivation it brings about and its instructional strategy for helping learners master the learning content, which is a type of declarative knowledge. Given the game techniques related to a declarative type of learning content, he introduces stories (i.e. where people tend to recall facts more accurately when they encounter them, which picks up on elaboration technique); sorting in which learners need to place content into the right slot or location without need to understand various categories or sorting requirements; matching the types of games requiring learners to link an image or idea to another image or idea; and replayability (i.e. when the game gives players the chance to repeat it).

# Procedure

The study was carried out with all participants’ and institute officials’ prior consent in terms of privacy, anonymity, and time allocation. The data were collected over eight weeks. Initially, the Oxford Placement Test was administered to form a homogenized sample of participants. Given the results of the test, they were classified into three groups at B1 level. In each instructional session, which lasted for 50 minutes, students of the three groups learned between 12 to 18 collocations related to one of the previously-mentioned topics, and altogether by the end of week eight, 120 collocations were covered. Regarding the non-gamified group, at the beginning of the first session, students were asked to complete the pretest of collocation. After that in each session, first the topic was brainstormed and then they were given worksheets, including exercises to learn the collocations related to that topic. The exercises included matching the collocations with their definitions, matching the first part of a collocation with its second part, and using collocations in a context. Finally, the answers to the exercises were checked in the class by the instructor and the students. The exercises were all similar to the activities in the gamified groups except that none of them were gamified. However, in the gamified groups, at the beginning of the first session, the instructor presented an introduction to the course using a PowerPoint file, explaining the game mechanic systems, rules, and the gamified activities learners were supposed to perform. After that, learners’ names were drawn, and they were divided into two teams. Each team sat on one side of the class and was asked to complete the pretest of collocation, which took them about 20 minutes to complete. The KR-21 formula was used to measure the test reliability, which produced an $r ~ \mathrm { o f } = . 7 5$ . Content validity was also used to check the inclusion of collocations related to each specific topic offered in each session.

After introducing learners to the topic, the first gamified activity in each session called brainstorming was for the teams to brainstorm any words related to the topic and write them down on a piece of paper. This activity was related to the idea of elaboration, which was one of the steps for teaching declarative knowledge discussed earlier. The activity was gamified using a time limitation of two minutes for both teams and allocating points to it. When time ended, the instructor collected the teams’ papers and counted the words they had written. The team with the greatest number of words earned five points for accomplishing the task. This activity was done the same way in both digital and non-digital groups.

Linking to the idea of association suggested by Kapp (2012), the second gamified activity, Definition Matching, was used to help teams know the collocations of that session while matching them with their definitions. For the digital group, this activity was done on the platform of Quizizz. First, the link to the game was shared with the teams and when both teams joined the game, the instructor clicked start and they could begin playing the game. Each team did this activity together and not individually; hence, all the team members discussed the questions together and decided which collocation matched the definition in the question. The activity was gamified by allocating points and using bonus cards. After finishing the activity, they received one point for each correct answer (e.g. if they had answered 12 questions correctly, they earned 12 points for that), and if they had managed to answer all the questions correctly, they received a bonus for that. For the digital group, the bonus cards were designed in the BookWidgets Software. To earn their bonus, a student from each team came to click on ‘spin’ and got their bonus. If they could earn the virtual currency, for example a $5 0 \$ 1$ , they were able to use the money to buy time for the later activities in the class. If they could earn the Exclusive Gem, their points for that activity doubled. For the non-digital group, the same procedure was followed except that their activity was designed on cards and that they were required to match the collocations on one set of cards with their definitions on another set of cards in their teams. No time limitation was considered for this activity, as its purpose was for learners to get to know the collocations with as much attention and time as they needed. However, it took teams 15–20 minutes to complete this activity.

The third gamified activity, Parts Matching, was designed based on the idea of organizing by Kapp (2012), requiring the teams to match the first part of the collocations with their second part. This activity was again done on the platform of Quizizz. However, this time teams were asked to complete the activity individually. Therefore, each team member joined the game on their personal phones. After starting the game, they tried to match the first part of the collocation, appeared in the stem of the question to its second part in the options. After completing the game, points were given to teams by calculating the average number of points all the team members had earned during the game. In this activity a bonus card was also given to the teams, even when one member of the team had managed to answer all the questions in the activity correctly. For the non-digital group, the first part of the collocations was on one set of cards, while the second part of the collocations was on another set of cards. Each set of cards was placed on the table and from each team a member took a turn to come to the table and match the first part of the collocations with their second part within the time limit of thirty seconds. Each team included five members, and as a result, this activity took five minutes to complete. For each collocation matched correctly, they were given one point.

With the purpose of replayability related to the idea of repetition by Kapp (2012), the fourth gamified activity, Snap, was designed in the Android application called ‘Charades’. In this activity, with the time limitation of one minute, the first part of the collocation appeared on the screen, and players were supposed to remember its second part. To perform this activity, from each team a member came to the front and stood in front of each other. Another student also came to hold the mobile phone in front of the players. After the first part of the collocation appeared on the screen, if they could remember the second part of it, they shouted ‘snap’ and could say the answer. If they could do this correctly, they were given one point for that. However, if they shouted snap and could not remember the second part or if they gave the wrong answer, they lost one point. If neither of the players could remember the answer, the student holding the phone just bent the phone downwards so that the next word would appear on the screen. When the first one minute was finished, the second round began with another two members of the teams. Overall, the points each member earned were added up and formed their total points of the activity. Another game mechanic used in this activity was the feature that if all members of each team were able to earn more than 20 points in the game, their point doubled. Therefore, it was easily noticeable that members of the teams were doing their best to reach 20 points. For the non-digital group, this activity was done the same way with the collocations on cards and the same rules for earning points.

Somewhat connected to the idea of repetition by Kapp (2012), the final gamified activity done in each session was called Guess Which Collocation. This activity was designed in the Android application ‘Charades’ in which the whole collocation appeared on the screen. In the first to fourth weeks, this activity was performed in a way that from each team one member came to the front and held the phone in their hands with its screen showing to their teammates. When the collocation appeared on the screen, the player’s teammates tried to describe the collocation for them and they tried to guess which collocation it was. In the weeks five to eight, the way of doing the activity was changed a little to raise its difficulty level: from each team a member stood in front of their teammates and the instructor was holding the phone in a way that only the member standing there could see the screen. That member saw the collocation and tried to describe it for the teammates and they had to guess which collocation it was. Again, for each collocation guessed correctly, they earned one point. For the non-digital group, this activity was done the same way with the collocations on cards and the same rules for earning points.

In weeks five and six, for both digital and non-digital groups, another gamified activity was added so that students could get the chance to use the previous weeks’ collocations. The activity was a reading and speaking task, including a story in which almost all the collocations from the previous sessions were used. However, they were used in a way that either the first or the second part of the collocation was missing, and learners were asked to fill in the blanks. The paragraphs of the story were separately given to each team member to read and then discuss the main idea of each paragraph in their team so that their team can place them in the correct order to make the story. When finished with ordering, teams then went through the blanks to write the missing words. This activity was gamified using time limitation by which teams were required to complete the activity in 15 minutes. It was also gamified using points; that is, for each collocation completed correctly, teams received one point and for the correct order of the story, five points were given to the teams.

In the last two weeks, for both digital and non-digital groups, teams were given the collocations from week three and were asked to write a story and use the collocations in it within the time limit of 10 minutes. Team members soon turned out to be discussing their ideas and collaborating with each other to write an interesting story. After the time was up, they handed in their stories to be read aloud by the instructor. For the correct use of each collocation in their stories they received one point, and if their story was interesting enough, they would gain five more points. In the last week, after finishing all the activities related to that week, the instructor announced which team was the winner and they literally cheered and clapped. After that, learners were asked to fill in the flow questionnaire based on the experience they had during the gamified sessions. They were also asked to take the posttest of collocation. Moreover, each learner in the gamified groups was interviewed to answer two questions on their perceptions of and satisfaction with gamification. Finally, three open-ended questions were also given to learners of gamified groups to investigate their experience of the sense of flow.

# Data analysis

One-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was run to compare the groups’ mean performances of the pre- and posttests. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also performed to compare the pre- and posttest scores of the three groups. To analyze the qualitative data, the six steps to thematic analysis suggested by Braun and Clarke (2006) was used to generate themes and to analyze each of the digital and non-digital groups’ responses to interview and open-ended questions. In other words, the six steps of becoming familiar with the data, generating initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining themes, and writing up were followed by the researchers. In addition, to identify the categories emerged from the data itself, posteriori codes rather than apriori ones were used. The two researchers also tried to be consistent in their coding and followed similar steps for coding, classifying, and analyzing the data, resulting in high inter-rater reliability (.92), using Cohen’s kappa. To analyze learners’ responses to the flow questionnaire, descriptive statistics were performed.

# Results

# Learners’ collocation knowledge in pre and posttests

To answer the first research question, which examined the impact of digital gamification, non-digital gamification, and non-gamified instructions on learners’ collocation knowledge, first paired-samples $t$ test was run to compare the pre and posttest scores of each group. Initially, the descriptive statistics of the three groups on the pre and posttests were computed, and the results are presented in Table 1.

Figure 1. P re and Posttest Mean Scores for Digital, Non-Digital, and Control Groups.

As indicated in Table 1, learners of the three groups showed considerable improvement in their mean scores from pre to posttest. In other words, the mean scores obtained in the posttests were different from those of the pretests for the three groups $( M _ { p r e } ) = ~ 1 2 . 1 2$ , 10.80, 10.96; $M _ { p o s t } \mathrm { = } ~ 2 5 . 8 4$ , 25.32, 19.20). Nevertheless, the scores were more heterogeneous in the posttests $\ R D _ { p r e } = 5 . 4 4$ , 4.48, 4.10; $S D _ { p o s t } \mathrm { = } 5 . 5 4$ , 5.15, 4.90). Figure 1 highlights the mean scores of the three groups for pre and posttest of collocation.

To compare groups’ mean performances on the pre- and posttests, one-way ANCOVA was conducted. The independent variable was the type of gamification, while the dependent variable consisted of scores on the collocation test administered after the treatment was completed. Preliminary checks were conducted to ensure that there was no violation of the assumptions of normality, linearity, homogeneity of regression slopes, homogeneity of variances, and reliable measurement of covariate. The results of ANCOVA are highlighted in Table 2.

After adjusting for pre-intervention scores, the results showed significant difference among the groups on the posttest of collocation $F \ ( 2 , 7 1 ) \ =$ 13.93, $p = . 0 0 0$ , partial eta squared $= . 3 0$ . The results also showed a small relationship between the pre and posttest scores of collocations as indicated by a partial eta squared value of .20. To compare the three groups’ performance on pre and posttests of collocation, one-way ANOVA was conducted. The results revealed no significant statistical difference in the pretest scores of the three groups: ${ \cal F } \left( 2 , 7 2 \right) = . 5 4 8 .$ , $ { p }  { \mathrm { ~ = ~ } } . 5 8$ , eta squared $= . 0 1$ , indicating that learners in the three groups had similar performance on the pretest of collocation. Furthermore, to compare their collocation knowledge in the posttest, one-way ANOVA was employed. The results indicated a statistically significant difference in the posttest scores of the three groups: $F \left( 2 , 7 2 \right) = 1 2 . 5 6 9$ , $p = . 0 0$ , eta squared $= . 2 5$ , implying that the three groups had different performance in the posttest of collocation. To exactly determine the difference among the three groups, the post-hoc test was used. The result is provided in Table 3.

\* The mean difference is significant at 0.05 level.

Given the Tukey HSD test, post-hoc comparisons highlighted that the mean scores for the digital group $\cdot M = 2 5 . 8 4$ , $S D = 5 . 5 4 { \AA } ,$ ) and the non-digital group $\langle M = 2 5 . 3 2$ , $S D = 5 . 1 5$ ) were significantly different from that of the non-gamified group $\mathit { \Delta } M = 1 9 . 2 0$ , $S D = 4 . 9 0 $ ), indicating that the collocation knowledge of the two gamified groups in the posttest was significantly different from that of the non-gamified group. Moreover, the digital group did not differ significantly from the non-digital group.

# Gamified groups’ satisfaction with the use of gamification

To investigate the level of satisfaction with learning English collocations in a gamified environment, students of both digital and non-digital groups were interviewed. They were asked if they were satisfied with the use of gamification for learning collocations and if yes or no what were their reasons. Students in the digital group provided two main responses. First, four students $\left( n = 4 \right)$ were almost satisfied with the gamified activities for learning collocations; two of them believed they needed more practice besides the gamified activities; while two students assumed that learning in such an atmosphere could be sometimes too stressful. The remainder of the students in this group $\left( n = 2 1 \right)$ ) were completely satisfied with learning collocations in the gamified environment. The reasons they provided for their responses included: it was challenging and highly competitive; it was enjoyable and fun; it encouraged teamwork; unlike traditional classes, it was not boring at all; and it was more efficient. Some of the themes extracted from students’ responses to the interview questions along with some samples of their answers are provided below.

It can be stressful at times.

I was satisfied. Getting involved in the games and learning helped us learn better and forget the time. But for me personally, it was stressful sometimes.

Learning with gamification is challenging and highly competitive.

I was satisfied with the use of gamification and there are so many reasons for that. First of all, teamwork was really helpful. Second, it was fun and exciting. Third, and the main reason was competition. Competition increases seriousness and we do our best to learn.

It was enjoyable and fun.

I was really amazed with the games. It helped me learn nice collocations while playing challenging and fun games.

It encouraged teamwork.

In my opinion teamwork and competition were really useful, because I tried to learn from my teammates and do my best in the class instead of learning these collocations at home and memorizing them.

It was more efficient.

I was satisfied because gamification helped us remember the collocations better. Traditional methods are boring but playing games and having fun help us learn better and faster.

Concerning the non-digital group, three students $\left( n = 3 \right)$ were somewhat satisfied with the concept of gamified activities for learning collocations and believed that they needed more practice besides the activities in the class and that learning in such an atmosphere could be sometimes too stressful. The rest of the students $\left( n = 2 2 \right)$ were totally satisfied with using gamification for learning collocations. The reasons they provided for their responses included: they could still remember the collocations after the class; different game elements helped them learn better; the sense of competition was really effective for learning; and teamwork promoted learning. Some of the themes extracted from the interviews along with some answers are provided below.

Being too stressful.

I was satisfied with the concept of using games and gamification in leaning. I didn’t want to lose, so I did my best to learn and win the games. Therefore, it became too stressful sometimes but all in all it was a nice experience.

Being able to remember collocations after the class.

Yes, it was useful for me. At first, I thought I might forget the collocations after a while, but then I noticed that even days after the class I could still remember them. So I realized that I had learned the collocations.

Different game elements helped us learn better.

I was satisfied and liked this method. I think earning points, rankings, and teamwork all helped us learn better.

The sense of competition was useful for learning.

I was really satisfied because everyone has a sense of competition in the class. And competition made us try harder for learning than the times we learnt in normal environments. It helped us become fast learners and increased our learning efficacy.

Teamwork promoted learning.

I think that teamwork helped me a lot to learn the collocations. This happened to me a lot when I didn’t know the meaning of some collocations and discussed them with my teammates and they helped me learn.

# Gamified groups’ perceptions of the use of gamification

Students were interviewed to elaborate on their perceptions of using gamification for learning English collocations and language skills. Students were asked what they thought about the idea of using gamification for learning collocations. Regarding the digital group, their responses included two main ideas. Four students $\left( n = 4 \right)$ believed that gamification could be useful for learning language skills just as a complementary method to traditional ones. The rest of the students $\left( n = 2 1 \right)$ )

were of the opinion that gamification could be definitely useful for learning both collocations and language skills. The main reasons they provided for their responses included: Competition and other game elements could promote learning; playing games and learning occur at the same time; It helped them forget about time and place and not get distracted from learning; it provided learning in a fun and friendly environment; and it helped students collaborate with teammates to exchange knowledge. Some of the themes along with samples of their answers are provided below.

Gamification as a complementary method.

Games always make things fun, especially the class environment which is always strict with rules. But I think gamification can be useful if only some parts of the class are gamified. I mean the teacher teaches first and then we play games to practice what we learnt.

Competition and other game elements in gamification can promote learning.

I think gamification can be useful because while we are competing with each other, we can learn better. I also think that different game elements, such as point and receiving immediate feedback made us use our skills to do our best to learn and be the winner.

Gamification is like playing games and learning at the same time.

I think learning with gamification is more effective because it is not boring and we are willingly and passionately trying to learn while playing the games.

Gamification helps students forget about time and place.

I think when we are playing games, our mind goes around the games and there is less distraction in our mind. So I think it makes us focus on what we are trying to learn. Because we need to learn fast in order to get more points in the games.

Gamification provides learning in a fun and friendly environment.

Compared to the courses I have passed, I realized that games and gamifying English skills can be a really better teaching approach than the other ones, because it is more fun and challenging. I think it would also work for other skills and I would gladly participate in such courses again.

This method does not make us tired by just looking at some stuffy paper and memorizing everything. It is like a process with a lot of teamwork and fun, which makes us all passionate about learning.

Gamification promotes working in teams and sharing knowledge.

I think gamification can encourage teamwork, which is so helpful. When I didn’t know the answer to a question, my teammates helped me to get the point. Therefore, I think teamwork is really nice for sharing our knowledge with others.

Regarding the non-digital group’s perceptions of using gamification for learning collocations and other language skills, their responses were as follows. Two students $\left( n = 2 \right)$ believed that gamification on its own would not be adequate for learning, and there needed to be some review or repetition to learn the collocations better. The remainder of the students $\left( n = 2 3 \right)$ ) held the view that gamification could be useful for learning both collocations and language skills as well. The main reasons included: competition promotes learning; learning with gamification is not boring but encourages diversity; gamification can work well for learning collocations and language skills; gamification encourages learning in teams; and with gamification students tend to try harder to learn than usual times. Some of the themes extracted from students’ responses to interview questions and their answers are provided below.

Reviewing and repetition should be added to gamification.

I think gamification is useful for learning language skills. But I believe repetition would also be necessary for this method. For example, we can have some homework to practice what we learn in the class. The homework can also be gamified.

Competition promotes learning.

When we are competing with others, we try harder to keep everything in mind and gain more scores. So I consider this method practical because it is not similar to normal classes. It’s like playing games and we are learning at the same time.

Learning with gamification encourages diversity.

With gamification I totally learned all the collocations and it was not boring at all.   
I think learning with games can also be useful to add diversity to normal classes.

Gamification can work for other language skills.

I think if we had other gamified classes like this one for learning other language skills, everyone would be glad to join. Because we realized that this approach to learning is useful for learning collocations and it can help us improve our English language skills.

Gamification encourages learning in teams.

Gamification helps us work in teams and try to help each other in learning. We correct each other’s mistakes; we even teach each other to understand things better. I think while working in teams we motivate each other to learn better.

With gamification, students try harder to learn than usual times.

Teaching with gamification is one of the most useful ways to learn. Because it encourages students to try harder and learn better in comparison to normal methods.

# Gamified groups’ experience of sense of flow

The sense of flow experienced by the students of the experimental groups (i.e. digitally gamified and non-digitally gamified) was investigated after collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. To examine the sense of flow quantitatively, the flow state questionnaire was used, consisting of two categories of absorption in games and balance between skills and challenges. Percentages of the answers to each item were calculated. Regarding the highest percentages in the digital group’s answers to the first category, $6 6 . 7 \%$ of the students strongly agreed with the item in which they thought they were in control over the games, while $1 3 . 3 \%$ of them strongly disagreed with the items related to what they had to do during the games matching their skills, the games not being too difficult, and their skills being in balance with the challenges of the games. Given the highest percentages in the non-digital group’s answers, $7 1 . 4 \%$ of the students strongly agreed with the item of knowing that they were able to play the games, whereas $7 . 1 \%$ of them strongly disagreed with the four items of mind and body working in harmony during the games, feeling of meeting the requirements of the games, the games not being too difficult, and their skills being in balance with the challenges of the games. Overall, students in both digital and non-digital groups held the view that there was a match between their skills and the challenges of the games.

With regard to the highest percentages of the digital group’s answers to the items of the category of absorption in the games, $7 3 . 3 \%$ of the students strongly agreed with the item of engrossing their complete attention through games, while $7 3 . 3 \%$ of them strongly disagreed with the item of not being engrossed at all in the games. Concerning the highest percentages of the non-digital group’s answers, $7 1 . 4 \%$ of the students strongly agreed with the item of fusing with the games, whereas $6 4 . 3 \%$ of the students strongly disagreed with the item of not being engrossed at all in the games. The relationship between the two categories of this questionnaire was investigated through Pearson product-moment correlation. Table 4 presents the results of this analysis.

As shown in Table 4, regarding the first category, the non-digital group’s mean score $\left( M = 4 . 1 6 \right)$ was higher than that of the digital group $( M = 4 . 1 1 )$ . The non-digital group’s mean for the second category $\langle M = 3 . 9 5 \rangle$ was also higher than that of digital group $M = 3 . 7 9 )$ ). Furthermore, as shown in Table 4, for both digital $\left( r = . 7 5 \right)$ and non-digital $\left( r = . 8 2 \right)$ groups there was a strong, positive relationship between the absorption in the games and the balance between challenges of the games and skills.

Regarding the first open-ended question about the level of engagement in the games, the reasons students of the digital group suggested were as follows: being to some extent engaged in the games because of being confused at the beginning $\left( n = 2 \right)$ and being engaged in the games because of competition, interesting and engaging games, and teamwork $\left( n = 2 3 \right)$ . For the second open-ended question about losing track of time and place while being engaged in the games, all students of the digital group held the view that they forgot about time and place because of enjoyable and fun games, teamwork, and concentration on the games. On the third open-ended question about the match between challenges of the games and students’ skills, the digital group’s answers were as follows: since some collocations were completely new to them, their skills to some extent matched the challenges of the games $\left( n = 2 \right)$ ; and they used their skills to play the games whose challenges helped them use their knowledge and learn from their mistakes $\left( n = 2 3 \right)$ .

$\overline { { \mathsf { p } \subset . 0 1 } }$ (2-tailed).

Regarding the first open-ended question about the level of engagement in the games, students of the non-digital group’s responses were as follows: being to some extent engaged in the games because of not understanding the meaning of collocations $( n = 2 )$ and being highly engaged in the games because of competition, interesting games, and teamwork $( n = 2 3 )$ . Regarding the second open-ended question about losing track of time and place while being engaged in the games, all the students of non-digital group $( n = 2 5 )$ stated that they forgot about time and place because of fun games, teamwork, and competition with the other team. Regarding the third open-ended question about the match between challenges of the games and their skills, three students $\left( n = 3 \right)$ stated that their language skills did not exactly match the challenges. However, most students $( n = 2 2 )$ used their skills to play the games whose challenges made them use their knowledge and skills while playing the games.

# Discussion

The results indicated significant improvement in the collocation knowledge of both digital and non-digital groups after receiving treatment. Given that each session of the treatment lasted for 50 minutes, it can be argued that the sufficient time allocated to gamified activities played a role in students’ learning outcomes. However, considering the findings of the study and what students reported, several gamification elements seemed to have been involved in participants’ learning success. Despite the fact that traditional classes seem to be more concerned with final scores students attain at the end of a course, students in a gamified class can clearly observe and mark their progress during the learning process. They can compete with other students, learn while having fun, and celebrate even their smallest achievements in learning, which seem to be the factors contributing to improvement of their collocation knowledge. This finding is in line with that of previous studies, advocating the use of gamification and game-based learning for collocation (Amer, 2014; Rasti-Behbahani & Shahbazi, 2020) or vocabulary (Chen et  al., 2019; Li et  al., 2021; Waluyo & Bucol, 2021; Wu & Huang, 2017). However, unlike the studies on digital type of gamification and game-based learning, this study added to the literature by reporting the positive impact of non-digital gamification on learning collocations, which can be an alternative strategy to digital gamified classes in a low-tech information setting (Zainuddin et  al., 2020).

The findings also revealed that both gamified groups were to a great deal satisfied with learning collocations in a gamified environment. Their satisfaction seems to be resulting from the fact that gamification could tap into their emotions and help them feel the difference between a dull environment and one provoking their excitement. They were also motivated to get involved in the gamified activities and learn at the same time as they wanted to win against the other team or beat their own team’s personal best. When they were disappointed after failing a game, challenges of the games invited them to try again. In addition, the teamwork and cooperation they had seemed to be another important factor in increasing their level of satisfaction. Teamwork enabled them to work together to achieve a shared goal unattainable individually. It also helped them learn from their peers and collaborate for learning instead of learning only from the instructor or themselves. As also argued by Rachels and Rockinson-Szapkiw (2018), the stressful environment of traditional foreign language classrooms and the anxiety it brings about can be reduced by gamification. In general, students tended to like the gamified learning environment, which engaged them both intellectually and emotionally. This result substantiates that of Medina and Hurtado (2017) in which students’ satisfaction with the use of Kahoot! for learning vocabulary was reported.

The results of interviews with students about their perceptions of using gamification for learning collocations revealed learners’ positive perceptions, which might be due to the fact that in the gamified activities, learning can turn into a fun and engaging task and learners become involved in their own learning process. They tend to try hard to learn without being forced because incentives, including various game elements, motivate them intrinsically. In other words, the game elements can drive them to learn just because they want to do their best for themselves or their teams and not because they have to pass a final exam. This finding of the study was similar to that of Amer (2014), who found learners’ positive attitudes toward using mobile technology in improving collocations and idiomatic expressions. However, some students preferred to have gamification as a complementary method to the traditional ones. This can be justified as they desire to first receive instructions from teachers or they may not be confident enough to take responsibility for their own learning from scratch. They may also assume that they should always learn in serious environments, and having fun should only be a complementary part of the class. The finding is to some extent supported by Dehghanzadeh et  al. (2016) in which the use of gamification for learning English collocations was found beneficial for learners’ experiences of engagement, enjoyment, collaboration, and motivation.

The results about the sense of flow experienced by students of digital and non-digital groups indicated that students were to a great extent absorbed in the games and considered their skills in balance with the challenges of the games, resulting in experiencing the sense of flow. What might explain this is that experiencing the sense of flow does not require that all elements of it be present (Csikszentmihalyi, 2008). For instance, in this study the following elements led to experiencing the sense of flow. First, the goals of the games were clear to students. Second, the games provided students with immediate feedback on how well they performed in an activity, which was shown by the number of points they earned. Third, there was a match between the challenges of the games and students’ skills. Fourth, when students were engrossed in the games, they seemed to forget the concept of self under the effect of awareness. Fifth, they did not even notice the time passing when engaged in the gamified activities. Finally, students worked in teams to complete the gamified activities. The importance of teamwork in inducing flow is supported by a study in which students rated flow to be more enjoyable when in a team rather than when they were alone (Walker, 2010). The finding substantiates that of Rachels and Rockinson-Szapkiw (2018), who argue that gamification includes elements that make up flow. The finding is also in line with that of Li et  al. (2021), who found that factors such as clear goals, balance of skills and challenge, and playability provided by digital game-based learning positively affected concentration.

# Conclusions

The study investigated the impacts of digitally and non-digitally gamified activities on EFL students’ learning English collocations, perceptions, satisfaction, and sense of flow. The results revealed that both digital and non-digital forms of gamification were almost equally effective for learning English collocations. However, non-gamified activities did not turn out to be as effective in learning collocations as the gamified activities. The results also showed that almost all students of gamified groups were satisfied with the use of gamification and indicated positive perceptions of using gamification for learning English collocations and other language skills. Digital and non-digital gamified activities for learning collocations could also lead to students’ experience of sense of flow. This study indicated that gamified language learning environments, regardless of their type (i.e. digital and non-digital), could be of great value and usefulness for increasing the learning achievements and turning language classes into fun and engaging environments.

Given the findings, some implications can be suggested. For instance, language learners can use various learning apps, such as Quizizz, Kahoot, Quizlet, Duolingo, and Charades, to name a few, which use the elements of gamification to make learning fun and engaging. Teachers willing to facilitate the learning of language skills and components can also use various game elements, such as points, leaderboards, competition, and bonus cards to turn the tedious tasks into fun and engaging ones. Even though there is limited time in their classes, language teachers can use game elements to gamify only some parts of the class activities, which would still be of great value and interest to students. Policymakers can also provide teachers with a team of experts well-informed about gamifying techniques in both digital and non-digital types to help them gamify the content of language classes.

Future researchers can examine the effects of gamified activities on learning language skills and other components. They can also identify students’ gamer types rather than taking a one-size-fits-all approach to gamify the learning content of language classes. Gamification with its various game elements and its different forms, if implemented correctly, appears to work for any age or proficiency level. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to examine its effects on students with different ages and proficiency levels. For example, the gamified applications specially designed for children can be possible candidates for conducting research examining the use of gamification for young language learners.

It is noteworthy to state that this study was not without limitations and the researchers were confronted with some obstacles throughout the process of the work. One of the inherent limitations of this research had to do with the number of participants. They attended the classes held in a language institute, where had placed restrictions on class sizes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, only a limited number of students could have been present in each class. It is apparent that a larger sample with a higher number of participants would definitely lead to more generalizable results. Moreover, a delimitation researchers had to impose was related to the types of non-digital activities. The digital gamified activities used in this study were created through the online platform Quizziz and the Android Application Charades. As a result, the gamified activities designed for the non-digital group were limited to a range of activities that were exactly similar to the digital ones in order to avoid any different condition in the two groups. Obviously, a study investigating only one type of gamification could provide the researchers with more flexibility in terms of the design and range of the gamified activities.
