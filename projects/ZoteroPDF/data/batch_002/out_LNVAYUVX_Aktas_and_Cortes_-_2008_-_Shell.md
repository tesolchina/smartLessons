# Abstract

This paper analyzes the use of a special type of unspecific noun, called shell nouns [Hunston, S., & Francis, G. (1999). Pattern grammar. Amsterdam: Benjamins; Schmid, H. (2000). English abstract nouns as conceptual shells: From corpus to cognition. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter], which are frequently used as cohesive devices, in the written production of published scientists and international graduate students. These nouns act like ‘‘shells’’ because when they are used in this function, they can enclose or anticipate the meaning of the preceding or succeeding discourse. Using a corpus-based methodology and quantitative and qualitative procedures, our study analyzes the frequency of some of these shell nouns, the different lexico-grammatical patterns in which they occur, and the functions associated with these patterns. The result of this study indicates that students used some of these nouns more frequently than published authors and that the functional patterns in which these nouns were used varied between the two groups of writers. These results provide valuable information that can be directly applied to English for Academic Purposes (EAP) instruction.

# 1. Introduction

One of the most important objectives of writing in an academic environment is to create texts that are coherent and cohesive in order to establish successful communication within an academic community. Thus, the analysis of the use of cohesive devices has been of great interest for researchers and language instructors involved in the study and teaching of academic writing (Connor, 1984; Hinkel, 2001; Nesi & Basturkmen, 2006). Moreover, the teaching of such cohesive devices is often the center of ESL academic writing classes. Exploring how certain lexico-grammatical features (such as nouns, conjunctions, and adverbial phrases) function in an academic text may provide information that could help students improve cohesion in their writing.

Several studies have compared the use of cohesive devices in the writing of native and non-native speakers of English (Connor, 1984; Francis, 1989; Hinkel, 2001; Scarcella, 1984). Most of these studies reported that non-native speakers’ use of certain lexical cohesive devices was often rare or inappropriate. Hinkel (2001) reports that even the advanced non-native speaker writers in her study did not use a wide variety of cohesive ties to achieve a unified text. Among the various lexical features that have been studied as cohesion markers, there is a special type of noun which has been the focus of many studies in the last two decades. These nouns have been labeled in different ways by different researchers: general nouns (Halliday & Hasan, 1976); anaphoric nouns (Francis, 1986); carrier nouns (Ivanic, 1991); enumerative nouns (Hinkel, 2001; Tadros, 1994); shell nouns (Hunston & Francis, 1999; Schmid, 2000), and signaling nouns (Flowerdew, 2003). Some examples of these nouns are concept, fact, idea, issue, results, reason, and problem. No matter how they are labeled, the notion behind these nouns is the same, as suggested by Ivanic (1991), who stated that these nouns have ‘‘both a constant and a variable meaning, and the variable meaning is dependent on the context in which it is [they are] used’’ (p. 109).

Using a corpus-based methodology, the present study analyzed a group of these nouns, called shell nouns, as explained in the following section, in the writing of published authors and international graduate students from various academic fields. The nouns can act like ‘‘empty shells’’ in certain contexts because they can enclose or anticipate the surrounding discourse. The study focused on their frequencies, the lexico-grammatical patterns in which they occur, and the functions they often perform. Specifically, the study addressed the following research questions:

1. Is the use of the selected shell nouns as frequent in the written production of published authors as in students’ production?   
2. Which lexico-grammatical patterns can be identified in both corpora for the most frequently used shell nouns in the published corpus?   
3. How do these shell nouns function in different lexico-grammatical patterns as cohesive devices? Are there any functional differences between both groups of writers?

In the following section we will present a conceptual framework for our study discussing lexical cohesion and we will provide an extensive description of shell nouns. Next, we will describe the corpus and methods used in the investigation. Finally, we will introduce and discuss the findings of the study, as well as some suggestions for future work on shell nouns.

# 2. Conceptual framework: lexical cohesion and shell nouns

As the purpose of the present study was to analyze the use of shell nouns to create cohesion in academic writing, we would like to start this section with a brief discussion of lexical cohesion in a text. Halliday (1994) affirmed that the choice of words can establish text continuity. This continuity may be realized by word repetition or by the selection of a word related to a previous one either semantically, as context-dependent continuity, or collocationally, because these words often co-occur. Halliday (1994) states that the use of key words can help maintain lexical cohesion over long paragraphs. The notion of continuity is particularly important in written scientific discourse, which often presents instances of ‘‘semantic discontinuity.’’ ‘‘Writers make semantic leaps, across which the reader is expected to follow them in order to reach a required conclusion’’ (Halliday, 1993, p. 82).

Lexical cohesion is also related to the notions of theme and rheme and their connection to given and new information. Halliday (1993) explains that in written English, new information is expected to occur as rheme in its unmarked position. Thus, the theme is usually given information that refers to something already mentioned in the discourse, performing a strong textual cohesive function. This theme is ‘‘often likely to be the summation of a fairly complex argument’’ that cannot be repeated as a whole so it is often packed into a nominalization (p. 60).This kind of nominalization is an essential resource for the construction of scientific discourse. ‘‘Under the pressure of the discourse, the nominal elements in the clause are gradually taking over the whole semantic content, leaving the verb to express the relationship between these nominalized processes’’ (p. 63). Halliday (1994) states that, even though nominalization is also frequent in other genres such as newspaper writing, in academic discourse the flow of information is generally packed into extended nominal groups in which processes and properties are nominalized.

The frequent occurrences of nouns and nominal groups in scientific discourse can be directly connected to the use of unspecific nouns to create lexical cohesion in academic prose. These unspecific nouns are the subject of analysis in the present study. Charles (2003) described these nouns as having two characteristic features: ‘‘they require lexical realization in their immediate context and they create cohesion’’ (p. 314). In his study of predictive lexical items in written discourse, Winter (1977) classified these unspecific nouns as belonging to the Vocabulary 3 type. These nouns are often sentence connectors and refer to open-ended lexical choices of the clause which are present in the immediate context. In a further study, Winter explained that ‘‘without the clauses which make them specific within adjoining sentences, these nouns are almost meaning labels for information’’ (1982, p. 133). The realization of these nouns in the surrounding discourse is tied to the concepts of encapsulation and prospection (Sinclair, 1992, 1993). Encapsulation ‘‘reclassifies a previous sentence by denoting it into an element of the new sentence,’’ (Sinclair, 1993, p. 8) while prospection refers to the case in which a linguistic element leads the addressee (or reader) to expect something specific in the succeeding discourse.

As previously explained, these nouns have been given different labels by different researchers in the literature. Table 1 shows a list of labels and their corresponding definitions. Hunston and Francis (1999) introduced the term shell nouns for nouns ‘‘which can be identified on the basis of their behavior’’ and which can be accompanied by some kind of expansion in the surrounding text (p. 185). Schmid (2000) considered shell nouns a combination of inanimate abstract and factual nouns. As Schmid’s structural and functional classification was used in our analysis, the term shell noun has been adopted for the present study.

Schmid (2000) explains that shell nouns are frequently used to convey one of these three functions: ‘‘the semantic function of characterizing complex chunks of information, the cognitive function of temporary concept-formation, and the textual function of linking these nominal concepts with clauses which contain the actual details of information’’ (p. 14). In addition, Schmid reported that these nouns are used in four lexico-grammatical patterns in which ‘‘they are interpreted together with their context’’ (p. 21) in anaphoric and cataphoric referential positions. The creation of text cohesion is facilitated by these referential relations between expressions. Schmid’s lexico-grammatical patterns for shell nouns with their textual anaphoric and cataphoric cohesive functions are shown in Table 2. These functions and lexico-grammatical patterns represent the original framework used for the analysis of a group of shell nouns in published and student writing conducted in the present study.

# 3. The study: corpus collection and data analysis

Two corpora were used in this study: a corpus made up of published research articles and a corpus of research articles written by international graduate students, all non-native speakers of English. Table 3 contains information about the corpora size and sampling.

The published writing corpus used in this study was part of the Published Research Article Corpus (PRAC), and the six disciplines included in this study were chosen according to the disciplines present in the student corpus. The PRAC has articles from over twenty disciplines, with approximately 500,000 words per discipline. However, for this study, only 120,000 words were selected from various academic journals for each of these six disciplines, as shown in Table 4. This smaller sub-corpus was randomly selected in order to make the number of shell noun tokens more manageable to analyze, particularly in the functional analysis.

The student corpus consisted of research papers written by international graduate students at a research university in the Midwest of the United States. The 28 participants were all students who had taken an advanced academic writing course in Spring and Fall 2004. This course is a required course for international graduate students whose academic writing proficiency does not meet the requirements of the English Placement Test administered by the university. The students were registered in MA/MS or Ph D programs in Art and Design, Biology, Computer Science, Economics, Environmental Engineering, and Physics and Astronomy and were speakers of different first languages (Chinese, Korean, Spanish, and Turkish). A minimum TOEFL score of 213 (230 for Economics) was required for students to be admitted into these programs. The papers written by these students, who gave consent to participate in this research study, were obtained through the course instructors and were scanned in order to be transferred into machinereadable text. They were research papers that resembled those articles in the published corpus in their organization and language use. The papers were written to report research studies in the students’ subject disciplines. Table 5 includes further details about the student corpus.

This study analyzed the use of Hinkel’s (2004) list of 35 ‘‘highly prevalent’’ (p. 284) abstract nouns with a cohesive function in writing (see Table 6). In the first stage of the quantitative data analysis, a frequency count was conducted using concordancing software, MonoConc Pro (Barlow, 2002), to determine whether the use of these shell nouns was as frequent in published academic writing as in the production of international graduate students.

As some of these words (such as challenge, effect, experience, process, and result) can be used as nouns or verbs, all instances of these words were carefully examined, verb occurrences were manually eliminated, and final counts for each noun were re-calculated. Once all the occurrences were limited to nouns only, the following stages of the data analysis focused only on the six shell nouns most frequently used in the published writing corpus. Thus, in the second stage of the analysis, the selected nouns were examined once more to decide whether they were functioning as shell nouns or belonged to shell noun phrases. In this stage, textual references indicated by the use of these shell nouns were analyzed in order to determine the content they carried throughout the text. Those examples that contained outsidetext reference (exophoric reference) were excluded because these nouns did not seem to express a textual shell content, that is, they did not conceptually carry the content of the noun and/or the noun phrase in the text. In a very few cases, particularly with the shell noun effect, the decision about the nature of the shell noun was problematic because in order to understand the exophoric reference, it was necessary to go through the text making decisions as consistently as possible. As illustrated in the following example from the student corpus, the noun phrase temperature effect did not have a reference in the text that could be classified as anaphoric or cataphoric. Thus, this occurrence was excluded from the analysis.

Thus, this study focuses on the oxidation of mixed Carbon monoxide and VOC by NANOCAT $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ as a catalyst and an oxidant. In this research, the oxidation/catalytic mechanisms of carbon monoxide and methane by $\mathrm { F e } 2 0 3$ nanoparticle were discussed. The catalytic activities of NANOCAT $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ were investigated by following up the CO and methane oxidation reaction by 02 at different temperatures, by the oxidation contact time of CO and methane caused by temperature effect, and by concentration as the different ratio of CO, methane and 02 in contact with the catalysts. The oxidation of CO with CH4 by normal $\mathrm { F e } 2 0 3$ catalyst was also examined; then, on the base of our results about both CO and CH4 oxidation, the comparison of catalytic oxidation activity and characteristics between normal Fe2O3 and NANOCAT $^ \mathrm { \textregistered }$ was discussed. (student - Environmental Engineering)

In addition, the following example from the published writing corpus shows the noun effect used in a proper noun phrase referring to a term common in the literature. Therefore, it does not have a corresponding anaphoric or cataphoric reference and the actual content of the shell noun cannot be found in the text. Thus, this example was also excluded.

Reasons may include ecological differences between species (e.g. the types of parasites to which they are exposed and the variability of the environments that they have to deal with), affecting whether increased intracolonial genetic diversity provides advantages, has no effect, or even damages colony fitness (for instance decision-making may be more difficult in multiple-paternity colonies under some circumstances if patrilines have different behavioural thresholds, (Page & Mitchell, 1998); and intracolonial diversity could make colonies more susceptible to diseases, the ‘Bad apple’ effect (Boomsma & Ratnieks, 1996). (published - Biology - JEBio)

As the two corpora used in this study were of different sizes (721,558 words for the published writing corpus and 73,482 words for the student corpus), the final frequencies of the shell nouns were normalized to 100,000 words to conduct a more reliable comparison. As defined by Biber, Conrad, and Reppen (1998), ‘‘normalization is a way to adjust raw frequency counts from texts of different lengths so that they can be compared accurately’’ (p. 263). In this process, the raw frequency for each shell noun in a corpus is divided by the number of words in that corpus and then multiplied by the basis chosen for norming (100,000 in our study). With the help of this calculation, it was possible to reliably compare the frequencies of each shell noun across the corpora.

In the final stage of the analysis, the six most frequent shell nouns in the published corpus were identified and these nouns were compared in the two corpora in terms of their lexico-grammatical patterns and their use in performing the functions their functions proposed by Schmid (2000). We chose to focus on those nouns more frequently used by published writers because we considered the published writing corpus the model of writing that students are expected to imitate.

First, the occurrences of the six selected shell nouns were classified according to the four lexico-grammatical patterns (introduced in Table 2): $\underline { { \mathbf { N } } } +$ cl, ${ \underline { { \mathbf { N } } } } + { \underline { { \mathbf { b e } } } } + { \underline { { \mathbf { c l } } } } .$ , th $+ \underline { { \mathrm { N } } } ,$ , and $\underline { { \mathsf { t h } } } + \underline { { \mathsf { b e } } } + \underline { { \mathsf { N } } }$ (Schmid, 2000). For the shell noun occurrences that did not fit into Schmid’s patterns, new lexico-grammatical patterns were identified and used in the classification and analysis. Finally, the examples were examined once more to investigate the use of these shell nouns when they performed characterization, temporary concept-formation, and linking functions.

# 4. Results and discussion

# 4.1. Frequency of shell nouns

Table 6 presents the frequency of the 35 shell nouns introduced by Hinkel (2004) in each of the corpora used in the present study, answering our first research question. The counts, normalized to 100,000, show that international graduate students used these nouns as shell nouns as frequently as published writers and, in some cases, much more frequently. This difference was emphasized by the result of the chi square test: $\mathrm { X } ^ { 2 } = 7 5 . 3 8 1$ , which on 31 df, is significant at $p < 0 . 0 1$ .

The difference in frequency of use between the two groups may not constitute a salient finding in itself because in some cases, this frequency did not represent many of the writers of the student group. Some of the shell nouns selected for this study were used by one or two writers out of the 28 writers in the student group. This is the case, for example, for event, which was used 10 times by only one writer and category which was used 10 times but by only two writers. This repetitive use of the same shell noun by only one author has undoubtedly bulked up the frequency of shell nouns in the student writer group. Published authors do use shell nouns more than once in their articles but the frequency is better distributed across authors.

The most frequently used shell nouns used in the published writing corpus (effect, result, fact, system, process, and problem) were selected to be the framework of comparison for the frequency analysis of the lexico-grammatical patterns and for the qualitative analysis of functions in both groups of writers. As previously explained, these six nouns were chosen taking the published author use of these nouns as the model for students to imitate. Fig. 1 illustrates the total occurrences of these shell nouns in the two corpora. Apart from being very frequently used by published authors, these nouns were also frequently used by many students. A chi square test conducted on these six nouns showed the distribution was not significant $\mathrm { T } ^ { 2 } = 7 . { \dot { 3 } } 7$ , $d f { = } 5$ ).

# 4.2. Lexico-grammatical patterns: identification and comparison across corpora

Only two out of the four lexico-grammatical patterns introduced by Schmid (2000) in his study could be identified in the written production of both published and student writers. These patterns were $\underline { { \mathbf { N } } } +$ clause and th- $+ \underline { { \mathrm { N } } } .$ . Neither published writers nor student writers used any of these shell nouns in the patterns ${ \underline { { \mathbf { N } } } } + { \underline { { \mathbf { b } } } } \mathbf { e } +$ clause (shell noun $[ \mathrm { N } ] + \mathrm { b } \mathrm { e } +$ complement clause [that-/to-infinitive/wh- clause]) with cataphoric function and th- $+ \underline { { \mathrm { b e } } } + \underline { { \mathrm { N } } }$ (demonstrative determiner [this, that] $^ +$ be $^ +$ shell noun $\mathrm { [ N ] }$ ) with anaphoric function. Both groups of writers, however, frequently used new patterns that had not been identified before in the use of shell nouns. These new patterns were: the $+ \underline { { \mathrm { N } } } ,$ , the $\pm \underline { { \mathrm { N } } } + \underline { { \mathrm { o f } } } ,$ $\underline { { \mathrm { a ( n ) } } } + \underline { { \mathrm { N } } } ,$ $\underline { { { \bf a } } } ( { \bf n } ) + \underline { { { \bf N } } } + \underline { { { \bf o f } } } ,$ and the same $+ \underline { { \mathbf { N } } } .$ . Table 7 presents a summary of the patterns found in the data used for this study with their abbreviations, and examples taken from the corpus.

Table 8 gives the normalized figures for the 6 nouns selected for analysis in the 7 patterns that occurred in our data. The published writing corpus presented a high frequency of occurrences of the shell noun fact (15 tokens, $8 7 . 8 \%$ of the total occurrences of fact in the published corpus) in the pattern $\underline { { \mathbf { N } } } +$ clause with cataphoric function. The student writing corpus presented only 4 tokens of this pattern for fact $30 \%$ of the total occurrences of this noun). Students used the shell noun fact more frequently in the pattern th- $+ \underline { { \mathbf { N } } }$ with anaphoric function. This is the main difference in the use of lexico-grammatical patterns for this shell noun between published writers and students.

Two of the new patterns identified in this study were also frequently used with the shell nouns effect, result, system, process, and problem by both groups of writers. The first of these two frequent patterns was the structure the $+ \underline { { \mathrm { N } } }$ with anaphoric function. The shell noun most frequently used in this structure in both corpora was system (13 times in the published writing corpus and 27 times in the student corpus), as in the examples below:

We conclude that we are in fact observing Mg II absorption at a much lower redshift. It is possible that this absorber is associated with a mass concentration that contributes to the lensing properties of the system, but it is impossible to test this hypothesis with the existing data.

The second most frequent new pattern was the collocational framework the $\pm \underline { { \mathrm { N } } } + \underline { { \mathrm { o f } } } .$ Similarly, both groups of writers preferred the same shell noun for this lexico-grammatical pattern: effect (18 times in the published writing corpus and 31 times in the student corpus).

The pattern th- $+ \underline { { \mathbf { N } } } _ { ; }$ , previously identified by Schmid (2000), was often used by both groups of writers for the nouns effect, result, system, problem, and process as shown in the following example:

A t-test is applied to test for a difference in the mean degree of risk reduction. This process is conducted separately for each risk proxy. (published - Economics - APFEC)

The use of these shell nouns in these lexico-grammatical patterns varied slightly across the production of these two groups of writers, with the difference in the pattern favored by each group for the use of the shell noun fact being the most salient. The contextualized presentation of shell nouns in their frequently occurring patterns of use together with their frequent functions (which will be analyzed in the following section) could become the main target in the teaching of shell nouns to mark and maintain cohesion in academic prose.

# 4.3. Functional analysis

This section presents a detailed analysis of the different lexico-grammatical patterns for the selected shell nouns when they perform characterization, temporary concept-formation, and linking functions, comparing these functional uses in the production of both groups of writers.

# 4.3.1. Characterization

The two groups of writers used shell nouns to semantically characterize a piece of experience in a general way, relying on the context for the identification of the details of information (Schmid, 2000). The lexico-grammatical patterns associated with this function are $\underline { { \mathbf { N } } } +$ clause and ${ \underline { { \mathrm { N } } } } + { \underline { { \mathrm { b e } } } } +$ clause, both conveying cataphoric reference in the text.

Whereas the pattern ${ \underline { { \mathbf { N } } } } + { \underline { { \mathbf { b e } } } } +$ clause was never used in either corpus, the pattern $\underline { { \mathbf { N } } } +$ clause was used with the noun fact in both corpora, as shown in the following two examples:

This fits with the fact that the dust lane appears to cross the spiral pattern of NGC 1410. (published - Physics and Astronomy - AST)

Given the fact that no price difference exists, the tuition of DMACC is not a consideration for non-Iowa students. (student - Economics)

Compared to the student writers in this study, published authors used fact in this pattern with higher frequency to convey the characterization function. It is clear that published authors feel comfortable using the noun fact in this cataphoric function. The most frequently used pattern for characterization with the other five shell nouns (effect, result, system, problem, and process) in the student corpus was the collocational framework the $\pm \underline { { \mathrm { N } } } + \underline { { \mathrm { o f } } }$ as shown in these sentences:

One technique, which is often used, is the Round Trip Time (RTT). The problem of this technique, [is that] it does not work if the mirrors are protected by firewalls. (student - Computer Science)

We study the human behavior during the process of wayfinding in MU and figure out what information is needed at each specific point. (student - Art and Design)

Likewise, in the published corpus, the most frequent pattern for this function is the collocational framework the $+ \underline { { \mathbf { N } } } +$ of for the shell nouns effect, result, problem and process, as illustrated in the following examples:

It is our belief that intelligent agents are well suited to dealing with the problem of monitoring vast volumes of dynamic information in a distributed fashion. (published - Computer Science - COACM)

Scenario building is a central concept in design, shifting the focus from the object to the process of communication and interaction, and covering all phases of the design process. (published - Art and Design - DESIS)

On the other hand, the pattern $\underline { { \mathbf { a } } } ( \mathbf { n } ) + \underline { { \mathbf { N } } } + \underline { { \mathbf { o } } }$ f was less frequently used with result and process in the published corpus while in the student corpus, this pattern was less used with the nouns effect, result, system, and process for the function of characterization.

As mentioned above, the patterns the $\underline { { + \mathrm { N } } } + \underline { { \mathrm { o f } } }$ and $\underline { { \mathbf { a } } } ( \mathbf { n } ) + \underline { { \mathbf { N } } } + \underline { { \mathbf { o } } }$ f were highly associated with the function of characterization in both corpora. The occurrence of these patterns to convey this function can find an explanation in the flexibility that the prepositional phrase adds to the noun phrase preceding it, characterizing a piece of information in the prepositional phrase. The occurrences of different nouns in the pattern $\underline { { \mathbf { a } } } ( \mathbf { n } ) + \underline { { \mathbf { N } } } + \underline { { \mathbf { o f } } }$ in both corpora may also have resulted from the nature of the work reported in the articles. Some authors might have favored shell nouns such as effect or result over the other shell nouns because their work was more closely related to cause-and-effect procedures. This phenomenon could only be explained through the examination of a wider variety of examples to identify differences across academic fields, for example.

# 4.3.2. Temporary concept-formation

The cognitive function of concept-formation (Schmid, 2000) is created by the repeated use of a word to refer to a certain experience. ‘‘The recurrent association between the linguistic form and the idea results in the formation of a more or less stable concept’’ (Schmid, 2000, p. 16).

In general, the concept-formation function is combined with the function of characterization for the nouns effect, results, and process in the pattern the $\pm \underline { { \mathrm { N } } } + \underline { { \mathrm { o f } } }$ in both corpora. Examples:

The effect of a change will vary with the values of the independent variables. (published - Economics - APFEC)

The process of administering the survey was slightly different for the two groups. (student - Economics)

In the published corpus, three shell nouns, effect, result, and problem, occurred in two patterns that can be associated exclusively with concept-formation. The first pattern is $\mathrm { a ( n ) } + \underline { { ( \mathrm { a d j } ) } } + \underline { { e f f e c t } }$ as shown in the following example:

However, comparing the coefficients of the pooled OLS and fixed effects models illustrates that controlling for underlying time-invariant heterogeneity in the sample has a significant effect on the results. (published - Economics - APFEC)

The second pattern associated with concept-formation was the same $^ +$ result/problem as shown in this example:

Of the two ramets that had relatively poor growth, one contained $\mathbf { R g M V }$ only and the other both viruses; the same result was obtained with ramets with relatively good growth. (published - Biology - ApBio)

The published writing corpus presented more distinct examples of temporary concept-formation than the student corpus. It is important to explain that there is a strong relation between the functions of characterization and temporary concept-formation because they both refer to experience. Students’ use of these nouns to perform the temporary concept-formation function alone was rare.

# 4.3.3. Linking

The interpretation of shell nouns that perform the textual linking function (Schmid, 2000) ‘‘depends on the shell content that must be expressed in the context, or at least be inferable from it’’ (p. 18). Only the pattern th- $+ \underline { { \mathbf { N } } } ,$ , which is closely associated with this function, could be found in both corpora, although it had a different frequency distribution among the selected shell nouns. Published writers frequently used this pattern with effect, results, system and process, while students used this pattern with fact and problem.

The most surprising finding was the frequent use of fact in the pattern $\underline { { \ t h - + \underline { { \Nu } } } }$ in the student corpus. Students mostly used this pattern in an attempt to convey inter-sentential cohesion. This use is much more frequent than the pattern $\underline { { \mathbf { N } } } +$ clause, which can be considered the typical pattern of use for the noun fact in academic prose, according to the overall frequency in the published corpus. The following examples illustrate the pattern th- $+ \underline { { \mathbf { N } } }$ .

For all the clay samples, the only fraction of chemisorbed ammonia was converted into the DeNOx products, while majority of NH3 desorbed from the clay surface. This fact suggests that only part of chemisorbed ammonia is activated properly to be converted into DeNOx products. (published - Environmental Engineering - ENVIR)

As Dc Bond and Thayer (1985) point out, individuals tend to overreact to new information. In this case, it would be possible to attain abnormal returns exploiting the inefficiency of investors in incorporating new information on stock prices. This fact is supported by some studies that establish a relation between returns and stocks holding periods, called momentum-effect. (student - Economics)

In the second example, the student writer uses fact to refer to what could be described as a hypothesis or an idea, while in the example from the published corpus, the noun is encapsulating the previously explained fact.

# 4.3.4. Most important differences across corpora

After having analyzed the three functions that shell nouns perform in context (characterization, temporary conceptformation, and liking), we can conclude that the most significant functional difference between published writers and students was in the use of fact: published authors used fact followed by a complementing noun clause with cataphoric reference for characterization, while students used it with a demonstrative determiner this with anaphoric reference to convey a linking function. Another noteworthy difference was that published authors’ writing provided more distinct examples of the function of temporary concept-formation for the shell nouns effect, result, and problem. In addition, the use of these shell nouns to convey the function of temporary concept-formation was rare in the production of student writers.

# 5. Conclusion

This study examined the structure and function of shell nouns in research articles written by published authors and international graduate students. It explored the frequency of the use of shell nouns in published and student academic writing and compared the functions of these shell nouns when used as cohesive devices by the two groups of writers in order to highlight similarities and differences.

The findings of this study provide insights that emphasize the importance of textual cohesion created by the use of certain lexico-grammatical features such as shell nouns in academic writing. In spite of the fact that the student writers in this investigation used a wide variety of shell nouns, they did not use some of them in the same patterns or to convey the same functions used by published authors, particularly in the case of fact. These students do not need to be taught these nouns as vocabulary items. They need to be exposed, though, to examples that illustrate the cohesive functions of shell nouns when used in the appropriate lexico-grammatical patterns to help them more efficiently organize the communicative purposes of their texts. Drawing on the corpus-based frequency and functional analysis of the patterns, the systematic teaching of these structures and their functional use could be included not only in writing classes but also in classes directed towards helping students develop their academic reading skills. As Martinez (2002) indicates, becoming aware of the way in which shell nouns signal discourse can help students improve their ability to understand the text and recall information from it.

The size of the student corpus may have been a limitation for the identification of examples of some of the functions, particularly the function of temporary concept-formation. These findings should be replicated using a larger corpus of student writing with similar characteristics. More samples of student production of these shell nouns could help overcome the problem of repetitive use of a shell noun by only one writer in the corpus, for example. In addition, to further investigate the use of shell nouns, it would be necessary to conduct the same analysis for other nouns on the frequency list such as approach, reason, and purpose. The analysis of these nouns could generate different results for frequency distribution when analyzed in published and student writing and alternative functions in different lexicogrammatical patterns. The use of these shell nouns in different disciplinary communities could provide further information on differences and similarities in the use of shell nouns across academic disciplines.

Finally, a deeper textual analysis of the more distinctive occurrences of the concept-formation function in published writing would be highly beneficial. This analysis could investigate the effect of the cognitive process behind the temporary concept-formation function and could shed light on ways to help students improve their use of different patterns to perform this function.
