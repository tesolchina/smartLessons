# Abstract

In recent years, the Internet, or more specifically, the World Wide Web, has become an important source for research information retrieval. However, the WWW, which allows anyone with computer access to upload a web page for public viewing, has a fundamentally different nature than traditional research sources such as a library whose contents receive screening from reviewers, editors, publishers, and librarians. This difference raises questions about whether learners are aware of the quality differences that exist between traditional and netsourced research. Via a quantitative analysis of 163 responses to a questionnaire and a qualitative analysis of the citations in the scripts from 17 L2 learners, it was determined that while initial indicators on the questionnaire pointed to a somewhat informed awareness of these quality issues on the part of the learners, performance on a written assignment displayed a mixed implementation of this knowledge. The findings suggest that academic writing courses need to engender a heightened level of vigilance among student authors of both the power and the perils of Internet research.

# 1. Review of lit

In the past several years the Internet has quickly become a legitimate supplementary source for academic research, or even an alternative research tool. In reference to English for Academic Purposes, Slaouti (2002) calls the World Wide Web a medium which is clearly relevant to academic study whose potential as a research tool should not be underestimated. However, the Internet, particularly the WWW, is fundamentally different from traditional research sources, such as libraries, whose variety of print media, such as books and journals with their associated publishers, have until recently controlled information from being widely disseminated, or at least acted as a quality filter (Branscomb, 1998). Before the WWW came into existence, authors needed to find a publisher in order to realistically have a chance of reaching a wide audience or have their works seriously considered. This situation has dramatically changed in the past few years because of at least four broad developments:

user-friendly browsers;   
sophisticated search engines;   
user-friendly software for web page creation; and increasingly cheaper computers and network access.

Essentially, these developments have changed the Internet, as it stood just over a decade ago, from a rather complex and exclusive form of media requiring specialist knowledge of hypertext, into an affordable tool easily used and manipulated by the masses. While the advances brought on by the user-friendliness of browsers, search engines, and web page creators has brought tremendous diversity and opportunity to those previously shut out by the publishing process, it has also produced new dimensions to information retrieval that exist to a far lesser degree in traditional research (Kirk, 2002). In effect, this absence of a filter, described above, coupled with the Internet’s ease of use, and its lack of centralized control has resulted in a huge increase in the amount and variability of quality in the information available. For example, a random keyword search now can often produce hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of matches ranging from personal websites to refereed journals. Scholars in the library sciences began recognizing this problem in the mid 1990s when access to the WWW became widely available, and established criteria for assessing the quality of a website especially when it is for research purposes. Smith (2002) and Auer (2002), for example, have compiled a comprehensive list of links to papers discussing the evaluation of Internet resources. Below are some of these evaluative considerations which have been adapted from library specialists including Cooke (1999), Hartman and Ackerman (2001), Kapoun (1998), Kirk (2002), and Tillman (2000):

authority and reputation. Is it produced by recognized experts? Is it recognized by others as a quality source? Does it have a preferred domain, e.g. .edu, .gov, .org, .net. Are the authors easily identified?   
purpose. Because websites are much less filtered (by publishers), they are more likely to have an ‘agenda’ to persuade. Their target audience may also be different from that of a library.   
coverage and objectivity. This includes the accuracy, range, detail, and originality of material provided by the site. Are links provided to a range of alternative viewpoints?   
accessibility and currency. Websites sometimes disappear, while books generally do not. Some are also free, while others are not. Is it regularly updated? Can it be accessed quickly? Are there many dead links?   
presentation or appropriateness. Is the site presented professionally and easy to use? Does it include non-text features and links?

The first four points above can be said to apply equally to conventional research sources. Students and scholars alike should always be assessing the authority and reputation of sources before citing them. Indeed, much like web-based sources, paper and ink sources found in libraries are not always reaching the highest of academic standards. They may, and often do have subtle agendas to persuade readers towards certain ideological viewpoints that are sometimes politically motivated, and therefore lacking objectivity. Certainly editors, publishers, and librarians are no guarantee that the ideas set out in a book or journal are of high quality. In this sense, learners need to be made aware of the importance of critically evaluating any source they use. However, it is contended that the WWW’s electronic and unfiltered nature brings a heightened urgency to source-evaluation. In a library, for example, readers are immediately able to ascertain a source’s author, publisher, and year of appearance. Books and journals, being confined to paper, ink and the conventions of the publishing industry, i.e. pages, chapters, tables of contents, indexing, etc., have a relatively uniform nature. On the other hand, electronic sources, beyond being unfiltered in the same way as paper and ink sources, often give no indication of who the author or website creator is. Likewise, the date of first appearance is often missing, and its continuing existence cannot be guaranteed, thus the need for the addendum ‘last accessed’ in any web-sourced reference. Finally, the non-linear textual nature of a webpage, in which learners are greeted with a greater variety of effects peculiar to the web, such as sound, video, enlargeable photos, and links to potentially thousands of other sources at the click of a mouse, adds a dimension to researching that has previously been unknown. Moreover, the commercial nature of the web, in which webpage creators may be motivated by profit rather than ideology, adds yet another dimension unseen in conventional sources.

These new dimensions mean that WWW research requires the development of both new skills and a more critical mindset on the part of those intending to use the WWW as a research source (Branscomb, 1998; Jones, 1996; Pasch & Norsworthy, 2001; Slaouti, 2002; Shetzer & Warschauer, 2000). Indeed, the recognition of this need is not new. Spoof sites designed for teaching critical Internet literacy have existed for some time. Examples include, www.malepregnancy.com and the now infamous Feline Reactions to Bearded Men (www.improb.com/airchives/classical/ cat/cat.html)

Briefly, the skills referred to above include (1) choosing and using search engines, discussion groups, etc., (2) searching within a field, e.g. searches within a magazine, newspaper, or bookseller, (3) following links, (4) dealing with and assessing non-text forms of information, (5) skimming and scanning, (6) determining the source of a Web site, (7) saving information (bookmarks or favorites), and (8) referencing.

The critical mindset, mentioned above, operates at another level where learners must operate on a higher state of alertness than when performing conventional research in libraries. Libraries, as distributors of published books and journals, have traditionally taken away the need for an exceedingly high level of critical awareness because that function was assumed to be fulfilled by the refereeing and editing process carried out by reviewers and publishers. On-line research requires all of the skills mentioned earlier, plus an ability to make judgments about validity, reliability, accuracy, and impartiality, while simultaneously being able to decide whether to pursue links, save the site, try another search, or give up on the Internet as a quality source (Shetzer & Warschauer, 2000). Therefore, while performing research on the Internet, the five points above serve as a starting point, after which, the more conventional critical elements exercised in academic research, such as Bloom’s Taxonomy, Analyzing, Synthesizing and Evaluating, take place.

Recent research has pointed to L2 learners in particular as lacking in these skills. Some researchers have suggested that because some groups of L2 learners come from collectivist cultures, unlike the individual-oriented cultures of native English speakers, they have not been socialized in an adversarial environment necessary for effective critical thought (Atkinson, 1997; Ramanathan & Atkinson, 1999). Others, however, claim that these second language learners do, in fact, possess critical thinking abilities (Davidson & Dunham, 1997); it is claimed that the perceived lack of these skills is more a result of differing assumptions and a lack of familiarity with the typically Western-oriented content, rather than deficient critical thinking ability (Stapleton, 2001). Regardless of whether certain groups possess this ability, this whole discussion of critical thinking skills in second language education highlights the importance of a critical mindset.

One of the few inquiries addressing the issue of web sourcing in EAP is Slaouti’s study (2002), which included questionnaire responses from 786 students at a British university, examining the extent to which the WWW was used by students for research purposes in their course work. Results suggest there is widespread use of the WWW by students for their research, although there was considerable variation among departments. Comments returned as part of the questionnaire suggested that students were uncertain as to whether citations to WWW sites held a status equivalent to conventional references. In addition, it appeared that there was some inconsistency regarding the advice and encouragement students received from teaching staff over the use of on-line resources. Slaouti concludes that in the context of EAP, the WWW as a research tool deserves specific study skill attention with a special focus on the critical evaluation of Web resources.

In an effort to further explore this new area of research in the context of EAP, the present study seeks to examine both the critical awareness of second language learners towards the use of WWW resources in their research, as well as the broader issue of whether the WWW can be considered a legitimate tool for academic research.

Accordingly, the research questions in this study ask:

Do students have an awareness of the differing quality of sources, especially those coming from the WWW, which they cite in academic papers?   
Do students both understand and display in their writing the WWW’s limitations as a research tool?   
What issues or nuances concerning the quality and bias of sources arise in the use of the WWW as a research tool?

# 2. Method

The experiment consisted of two parts, a questionnaire administered to 163 second year, undergraduate students (Appendix A), and a more in-depth qualitative study of essays received from a much smaller cohort of 17 students who were also respondents to the questionnaire. Some members of the latter group were also interviewed after completing their essays.

Participant students studied in six different faculties at a large national university in Japan. The university in question is considered one of the top in Japan with a roughly $20 \%$ acceptance rate of candidates applying for entrance into first year. Being second year students, over $90 \%$ were either 19 or 20 years old, and all had studied English for at least 7 years, six in junior and senior high school and one more year at university. All students are required to take a one-semester course in basic computer skills in their first year at which time they receive an account for accessing and communicating via the Internet. The questionnaire was administered on the first day of a class called English Writing, which is one of four required electives. Students are free to choose one of the basic language skills (reading, listening, and speaking comprising the other three) in their second year of study. In this sense, all the participants had self-selected the skill of writing.

Part 1 of the questionnaire was designed to establish learners’ usage pattern of the Internet (Table 1). Part 2 aimed to understand respondents’ beliefs about the quality of various research sources (Table 2). In each case, some items largely irrelevant to the study’s goals were included for the purposes of comparison, and to test the reliability of responses.

Among the 163 respondents to the questionnaire, 17 education and law faculty students, who attended the English Writing class for one semester, participated in the second part of the experiment. Instruction in the course, which was held in a computer room, focused on techniques of persuasive writing as well as skills for using the Internet for research purposes (outlined earlier). The final assignment required the writing of a 1000-word persuasive essay on a topic of their choice requiring a minimum of 10 Internet references with a maximum of three from any one genre, e.g. newspaper, company, journal, NGO, government web site, etc. A pilot essay on the hunting of whales was administered in the early part of the course in order to assess the present study’s feasibility and to establish parameters. Students were required to fill in a table at the end of their essay in order to classify their citations and rank them according to specified criteria. The citations from this essay were used for the purposes of answering the research questions outlined earlier.

$1 =$ good quality, $5 =$ bad quality.

The quality and nature of each essay’s referenced source was determined via a system in which each student author provided self-perceptions of his or her own sources. Sources were assessed in the following areas: genre, general quality, and degree of bias. These were scored on a Likert scale (outlined in Table 2). Although the self-perceptions exercise was designed for experimental purposes, the selfassessment of these elements was assumed to act as a pedagogical tool in itself which would develop a critical mindset among the learners about a source’s quality. As critical Internet literacy was not the main focus of the course (persuasive writing was the primary genre discussed), evaluative criteria for web-based sources was neither stressed nor practiced. In this sense, the present study attempted to establish baseline information about learners’ ability to detect quality and bias among websites.

# 3. Results

The results of the questionnaire of 163 students and a description of the results of the study of the essays received from the smaller group are discussed below in two sections.

# 3.1. Part 1 Questionnaire

In the first part of the questionnaire (Table 1), question items attempted to discover the WWW usage pattern of the respondents. In the first item, which asked how often the participants used the WWW, respondents’ self-assessed answers averaged 2.67 indicating a tendency towards frequent usage. Only seven participants claimed to never use the WWW. While the term ‘often’ tends to have relative interpretations, the low number of respondents who claim to never use the WWW, reveals that the vast majority of the participants had some familiarity with its use. The responses to the remaining questions in part 1 tend to support this view. In particular, the response to item No. 2 about the frequency of using search engines (mean 2.36) showed a strong tendency towards their use.

The third question asked participants to self-assess the frequency at which they used the WWW for specified purposes. Five broad purposes were isolated by the questionnaire; however, the answer to only one of these, i.e. research, was sought for the purposes of this study. The reliability of attitude questionnaires of the type used for this study can often be called into question. Participants do not necessarily read items thoroughly or provide truthful responses. For this reason some items were included to test for the authenticity of responses. For example, the mean score for ‘shopping purposes’ (4.50), with a very low standard deviation, dovetails strikingly with the well-established Japanese aversion to using the Internet for purchases (The Economist, 19 April and 24 May, 2001). On the other hand, the high frequency usage for ‘hobbies’ correlates well with recent indicators (The Economist, 11 October, 2001). These two ‘tests’ suggest that the questionnaire responses were reasonably reliable. As for the response that was actually sought, i.e. frequency of usage of the WWW for research purposes, respondents mean score, 2.46, revealed that this was their second most common reason for using the Internet after hobbies, among the five choices.

The second part of the questionnaire asked respondents to self-assess their attitudes about the quality of sources on a scale from ‘1’ (good quality) to $^ { 6 } { \cal 5 } ^ { \gamma }$ (bad quality) if they were citing them in a research paper. ‘Quality’ in this case was defined as accuracy, truthfulness, and impartiality. (Note, although the questionnaire was conducted in English, some words were glossed in Japanese). Again, concerns about reliability arise when attitude scales of this nature are used. One indicator that a respondent is making serious efforts at self-assessment is a mixture of responses for all the items. Conversely, if a respondent circles the same number for all items, there are serious concerns about whether he or she has answered sincerely or even read the questions. In the present study, only one respondent (circling only ‘3’) answered in this fashion.

The mean scores in Table 2 are indicators of respondents’ beliefs about the quality of each item. As mean scores approach the extremes, namely ‘‘1’’ or $\mathbf { \bar { \Sigma } } ^ { 6 6 } 5 ^ { , 5 }$ , they display stronger collective beliefs, good or bad respectively, about the quality of the source in question, while a score at $\mathbf { \bar { \Psi } } ^ { 6 6 } 3 ^ { \mathbf { \vec { \mu } } , 9 }$ suggests the respondents felt ambivalent. In the results that follow, mean scores are expressed in terms of their distance from the score $\mathbf { \Delta } ^ { 6 6 } 3 ^ { , 3 }$ . The distance from $\mathbf { \mathfrak { s } } _ { 3 } , \mathbf { \mathfrak { s } }$ is named $m$ , with ‘good’ quality defined as a score significantly less than $\cdot 3 ^ { \cdot }$ while ‘bad’ quality is defined as a score significantly higher than $\cdot _ { 3 } \cdot$ . The significance value of the distance from $\mathbf { \Delta } ^ { \bullet } 3 ^ { \bullet }$ is set at $P { \leqslant } 0 . 0 5$ . Fig. 1 graphically illustrates the respondents’ attitudes.

Apart from information derived from a government home page, $m = 0 . 0 1$ , respondents collectively appeared to have clear beliefs about the quality of sources (Fig. 1), i.e. all other sources scored significantly different from the ambivalent ‘3’. Good quality sources as judged by mean scores were library book $\gamma _ { m } = 1 . 0 0 $ ), international journal

$\mathrm { ' } m { = } 0 . 7 7 \mathrm { ) }$ ), news magazine $( m = 0 . 5 6 )$ , Japanese academic journal $\scriptstyle { m = 0 . 4 4 } )$ , on-line journal $\cdot _ { m } { = } 0 . 3 4 )$ , NGO website $\mathrm { \Delta } m = 0 . 3 1 )$ ), and TV news $\stackrel { \prime } { m } { = } 0 . 2 1 $ ). Respondents scored three types of sources as bad quality: average student’s personal website $\mathrm { \Delta } m = 0 . 3 1 \mathrm { \Delta }$ ), student newspaper $( m = 0 . 3 4 )$ , and magazine advertisement $\mathrm { \Delta } m = 0 . 3 8 )$ .

# 3.2. Essays

In the second part of the experiment, in which the 17 participants self-assessed their own persuasive essays, both qualitative and quantitative findings emerged. Table 3 shows the participants’ self-assessed perceptions of the quality and degree of bias of the sites they cited. Difficulties arose at this stage because it was found that participants occasionally misidentified the genre of their referenced site. For example, one participant called one of his sites an NGO, when it fact, it was a company. For this reason, the author of this study reassessed each site and those results appear under ‘genre’ in Table 3.

The 170 sites visited by participants were classified into the following genres in order of frequency: news sites $( n = 3 9 )$ , NGO (39), government (28), company (22), personal (20), academic (14), discussion group (4). The topics self-selected by participants were as follows: the new five-day school week in Japan $( n = 3 )$ , mobile telephones (2), death penalty (2), smoking (1), euthanasia (1), in vitro fertilization (1), human cloning (1), American military forces in Okinawa (1), dual surnames for married couples in Japan (1), suffrage for foreigners in Japan, (1), 9th article of the Japanese constitution (renouncing military forces) (1), the issue of the Japanese national flag and anthem in schools (1), and nature versus nurture (1). There was a strong pattern towards citing English language web sources for those topics that were not Japan-focused. Conversely, participants tended to cite Japanese web sources for those topics centering on issues in Japan.

The participants’ self-assessment of their references showed a clear pattern with all genres registering generally positive quality and bias values except personal websites, which scored considerably lower than the other genres in both areas (Table 3). Inferential statistical analysis was not applied to these figures because, in a few cases, participants had misidentified the genre; in addition, some genres were not visited often enough to validate such an analysis. Therefore, these figures are for broad illustrative purposes only. Follow-up interviews revealed that some participants gave higher scores to websites that included objective criteria, such as statistics, over opinion-oriented sites. Others claimed that provided a site supported their views, they would cite it regardless of whether they perceived it as poor quality. As for scores related to bias, some participants claimed to favor sites which included a variety of opinions over those that appeared to have an agenda to persuade.

# 4. Discussion

# 4.1. Research using the WWW

The questionnaire revealed that respondents, as a whole, were clearly not strangers to the WWW. This was not a surprise especially given the huge advances in networked mobile telephony that have emerged in Japan over the past few years. Search engines appear to play a key role in respondents’ navigation of the WWW judging by the familiarity respondents voiced (second item Table 1). In a follow-up interview with six randomly selected participants, responses confirmed that keyword searches using Google were virtually the only method used for arriving at research sources for the assignment in the present study. Other possible ways, such as entering the address of a site that was cited in an article, were not mentioned by any of the respondents.

Just as a catalogue is necessary when doing research in a library, search engines are essential tools for performing research on the WWW. However, unlike library catalogues, Internet search engines are commercial ventures which need to generate revenue. In order to produce income, some search engines offer a service that provides paying customers, viz., sponsored links, with a commitment to appear near the top of search results (McLaughlin, 2002; Sullivan, 2002). These sponsored links often appear together with ‘real results’, i.e. unpaid links, often without being identified as advertisements. In fact, ‘real results’ are generated by closely guarded algorithms which ‘‘[narrow] down billions of choices before revealing the most promising’’ (McHugh, 2003). Given that $70 \%$ of search engine users do not scroll beyond the second page of results (McLaughlin, 2002), researchers may be unwittingly steered towards arriving at a commercial site. Indeed, when Sergey Brin, one of Google’s co-founders, was asked about this issue, he responded, ‘‘Say someone came looking for breast cancer information and didn’t know that some listings were paid for with money from drug companies. We’d be endangering people’s health’’ (McHugh, 2003).

Several instances of this concern about data retrieval integrity occurred in the course of the present study. One such example occurred when the participant who wrote about in vitro fertilization cited a hospital website disseminating information about abortion and IVF. If an entrepreneurial management at the hospital had decided to pay a search engine in order to increase the website’s exposure, its site would presumably appear among the first results by those keying in words such as abortion or IVF. The key word abortion turned up 1,870,000 links in a Google search on 7 August 2002, as this paper was being written. Seeing that such a staggering number of sites is impossible to investigate in detail, researchers are most likely to go to links at the beginning of the search results. Naturally, knowledgeable researchers will avoid keywords that result in so many matches, but learning how to do this requires experience in choosing key words and using Boolean commands (see Barker, 2002). It should be noted here that the search engine, Google, does presently identify sponsored links via a color and shading scheme, and there is some indication that other search engines may follow suit (McLaughlin, 2002); however, the algorithms that produce these results are unknown to the public.

While this example regarding research on abortion is hypothetical, it reveals an added dimension that exists in web-based research which requires additional levels of detection and critical thinking on the part of the researcher. If commercial, or ideologically biased links predominate among the first several screens of search results, subtle agendas to persuade could leave all but the most critically evaluative researcher shifted towards or away from a particular viewpoint. Therefore, as the WWW becomes an increasingly common source for research materials, it is contended that consciousness raising of ‘net nuances’ of this sort may be necessary as part of academic writing programs.

# 4.2. Quality of sources

Part 2 of the questionnaire attempted to gauge the baseline attitude of students regarding quality of research sources as they entered their second year. While there is no definitively correct ranking for the eleven sources listed in Table 2, the mean scores of the respondents, when ranked in order of quality (Fig. 1), appear to roughly conform with conventional notions of the quality of research sources. All sources that scored higher than $\mathbf { \Delta } ^ { \bullet } 3 ^ { \bullet }$ , i.e. tending towards poor quality, were either produced by non-professionals, i.e. students, or obviously biased, i.e. magazine advertisements. On the other hand, all sources produced by professionals, except those created by governments were rated good. Moreover, and perhaps significantly, among the ‘good’ quality sources, a further distinction can be made between print and non-print media, with respondents scoring anything that appears in print, as being of higher quality than electronic sources of information. In a reflection of tradition, and perhaps familiarity, respondents judged a book from the library as having the best quality, significantly better $\scriptstyle P = 0 . 0 5 )$ than the second best source, international journals. These results suggest that the second year student respondents generally accorded with conventional perceptions of the quality of sources. Yanni and Hoy (1998) also imply the superiority of print sources over electronic ones in claiming

you must apply sound judgment as you evaluate each of your electronic sources just as you would the print sources you find in the library. But you can be fairly confident that the print sources have gone through review processes, that have been judged by other scholars, and that the editorial and production processes that resulted in the published book contributed to its reliability (p. 650).

In addition, Hairston and Ruszkiewicz (1996) outline detailed criteria for selecting reputable research sources (pp. 542–547), several of which attempt to distinguish between the sources that appeared in the questionnaire used in this study. For example, while not categorically stating that scholarly journals are better quality than commercial ones, Hairston and Ruszkiewicz assert that scholarly journals are more likely to be primary sources of information. Again, the respondents seemed to recognize this, scoring international academic journals as better quality than newsmagazines. Interestingly, respondents collectively expressed ambivalence towards government web sites, perhaps reflecting university students’ mistrust of authority. In the end, it is encouraging that the student participants collectively displayed a reasonable intuitive knowledge about the quality of research sources, which accords with conventional notions in the literature.

# 4.3. Assessing websites

The analysis of the 17 essays provided deeper insight into how using the Internet as a research tool has different nuances and hazards. Sometimes it is the troubling data which does not conform well with the research design that offer the most revealing information. Classifying web pages according to their genre can be difficult. For example, several citations used by the participants came from personal web pages disseminated through university websites. While some participants correctly classified these sites as ‘personal’ web pages, others assumed that they were ‘academic’. In other words, although the domain name of a site may be a university with the .ac or .edu domain, which appears to lend academic legitimacy to the content, in fact, the web page itself could be a personal one which may have had minimal vetting or even screening; therefore, it may have been far from objective or scholarly. In another similar case, a participant classified a commercial enterprise as an NGO. Indeed, webmasters may sometimes deliberately design or disguise their sites to appear similar to organizations that simply supply information for the public good, all the while being an advocacy site or having a commercial agenda. This indicates that domain names which appear to impart a sense of legitimacy, e.g. .edu or .org, may in fact offer little more academic rigor than a commercial domain name, such as .com.

Distinguishing between websites that disseminate information for the public good, as opposed to those that wish to fulfill political or religious agendas, or those that simply try to steer a browser toward a purchase, is often very difficult. For example, the hypothetical hospital website referred to earlier which offers information about abortions or IVF pregnancies could potentially be viewed as participating in all three of these objectives. This makes it incumbent upon the reader to be aware of the agendas that exist, and to differentiate deeper purposes in order to avoid being swayed by reasons and evidence that exist for purposes other than simple information dispersal. While subtle biases can exist in the most rigorous of published works found in the library, these works must still pass the scrutiny of editors and reviewers as well as publishers before they end up in print. Web pages often lack this scrutiny (Kirk, 2002), especially in the case of personal websites and NGOs.

As for the actual citation choices made by essay-writing participants, news, NGOs, and government sites predominated (Table 3). Perhaps these genres were chosen by participants because of the assignment’s nature. Persuasive writing requires that an author choose a divisive topic. In the present study, participants mostly chose touchstone issues often discussed in the media; therefore, searches performed using engines would most likely produce results showing links to news, NGOs, and government sites. These three sources, while often objective, can still have their own subtle, and sometimes not so subtle, agendas to persuade. For example, during the pilot study, which required students to write about whale hunting in Japan, keyword searches produced links to environmental groups and governments. The content difference within the two genres was, as expected, remarkable. Even the supposedly objective statistics contained within were sometimes different.

Such differing data raises further questions about the integrity of information found on the web. In any type of research, information from sources can vary from the apparently factual, such as statistics, to the opinion-oriented. While web-based research is not unique in this regard, the need to identify a source’s authority, or even its author, is essential for establishing believability, and it is here that learners need guidance about how to distinguish between sources. Often websites do not clearly display their authors or sponsors, yet large NGOs with sophisticated websites may lend an appearance of authority on an issue. However, they clearly have ideological agendas. The example of differing statistics mentioned above reveals that even the most objective-oriented data can be used in ways to place a cause in a more favorable light. For example, one participant student who wrote on the death penalty cited statistics from a site opposed to capital punishment which showed an actual decline in murder rates once the death penalty had been abolished. However, judicious selection of the time period, type of crime, and locality could have produced statistics that supported the countering argument. The selective use of statistics is a common way to manipulate and even misrepresent data in order to swing a reader towards a particular viewpoint (Ramage & Bean, 1999) and again is not unique to web-based research. However, the likelihood of encountering such bias is magnified in web-based research because of both its unpoliced character and the nature of keyword searches. This study revealed that learners can arrive at a huge variety of sites via keyword searches, and the participants used the information at these sites to help solidify and support their views. Indeed, the participants made many citations to ‘company’ and ‘personal’ websites despite their self-assessed doubts about the quality and degree of bias of personal websites (Table 3). Even more concerning was the participants’ self-assessed lack of concern about levels of bias at company websites, which they ranked similarly with academic and news sites. This may be due to their sophisticated appearance, as they are often professionally produced, and written with an aura of objectivity. Interestingly, in some cases, the web pages cited by the participants were difficult for the researcher of this study to know how to classify, e.g. company, NGO, or discussion group, again highlighting the need to teach a greater critical awareness of the agendas to persuade that exist on the WWW.

While this study can only claim to represent the views of the cohort of Japanese learners who participated, it may have broader implications. The participants’ rather cavalier use of sites whose genre they, themselves expressed doubts about, coupled with their collective impression that company websites have similar levels of bias as academic and news sites presents a troubling issue. Although part one of the questionnaire clearly revealed that the participants had a reasonably good schema for differentiating between good and poor quality research sources, when this schema was actually put into practice in the writing assignment, the learners appeared to compromise their integrity. In other words, even though their beliefs told them that some genres of websites were likely to be biased, and perhaps without academic merit, they used them anyway, presumably because they supplied information favorable to the thrust of their argument. Perhaps this is to be expected in an assignment of this nature. However, such an expedient path is one that has not been so widely open to students writing research assignments until recently. The emergence of the WWW has created a need for new curriculum objectives that recognize the Internet as a fundamentally novel source of information. This novelty has repercussions not only for students, but for teachers of EAP as well. As this researcher can attest, affirming the quality, and even the source and genre, of a website cited by a student can sometimes be both challenging and time-consuming. This indicates that evaluative elements of critical literacy on the Internet need to be brought to the fore in academic writing programs. Specifically, learners need to be taught in greater depth about the various subtleties of persuasion which they previously were less likely to encounter.

# 5. Conclusion

Returning to the three original research questions, the participants appeared to have an awareness of the differing quality of research sources, including those on the WWW. However, the extent to which they displayed the WWW’s limitations as a research source was only partially evident as explained earlier. Finally, various issues and nuances arising out of this study suggest that the nature of the WWW as a research source, although similar to conventional sources in many fundamental ways, has differences significant enough to require new initiatives in the EAP writing curriculum.

Because the Internet is such a new form of media, questions still remain about what role it will play as an academic resource. Since long before Gutenberg, ink on paper has served as a powerful source of information and authority. The participants in the present study had an intuitive sense of this when they ranked printed sources above electronic ones. Still, the present era may be one of transition. An example of this phenomenon arose during the writing of this paper. Like most authors, I needed to consider where to submit this paper. In the course of this consideration, I came across an internationally refereed electronic journal which appeared appropriate. Upon further consideration, however, I decided to submit to a paper and ink journal partly because its final product appears tactilely. Such a decision probably reflects my generation, one which grew up with paper as the dominant source of authoritative information. Younger generations who grow up with video games and the Internet may display less of a propensity for information that arrives in a tactile form, and may even prefer that which arrives electronically.

The pedagogical implications arising from the present study chiefly concern the need to recognize and understand the nuances of the WWW as a source of information in academic research. The very recent emergence of e-journals, e-books, and the many other genres found on the web represent a new type of media that has growing merit and offers tremendous potential. However, with this potential, come concerns about quality and bias that must be addressed. This is where the teacher plays a role. As part of academic writing courses, the power and the perils of Internet research need to be discussed. Specifically, not only does a heightened level of vigilance need to be engendered when using the WWW as a research source, but academic writing courses also need to discuss the agendas of persuasion that exist in web-based sources, and how they differ from conventional research sources.

Any journal article, or for that matter, any piece of writing to a large extent reflects the era in which it was written. In the case of the present study, this is true to an even greater extent because of the Internet’s quickly growing dynamism as an information source. In the same year that this study was conducted (2002), the participants’ university library established access to electronic journals, which in a sense, represents a major step towards the Internet performing the role of a library and further blurring the line between print and on-line media. If such change continues to the point where not only journals, but all library resources are available on-line, some of this study’s premise, viz., the library as a focus of comparison to the Internet as a source of information, will become irrelevant. What will remain relevant, however, whether or not the Internet replaces the library, is the growing need for a more critical mindset among all of those using the WWW for research purposes to distinguish between good and poor quality sources.
