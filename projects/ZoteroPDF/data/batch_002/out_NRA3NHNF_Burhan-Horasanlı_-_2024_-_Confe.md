Academic discourse

This situated case study focuses on two international doctoral students’ academic socialization processes in conference presentation preparation sessions in an engineering research team at a university located in the United States. Language socialization theory (Schieffelin & Ochs, 1986) and dramaturgical theory (Goffman, 1959) were utilized as conceptual lenses to examine the students’ academic socialization processes. Based on ethnographic observations, videotaping of team interactions, and semi-structured interviews, the study focused on the research team’s use of corrective feedback as the unit of analysis. The findings showed that the research team socialized the students into specific ways of using language on PowerPoint slides, professional vision, and oral conference performance. The study contributes to existing research by discussing 1) how academic socialization is inextricably linked with various competencies and thus is a multifaceted process, and 2) the systematic nature of academic discourse socialization in communities of practice which are located at the intersections of professional and academic interaction.

# 1. Introduction

Academic discourse socialization (ADS hereafter) studies “the social, cognitive, and cultural processes, ideologies, and practices involved in higher education in particular” (Kobayashi, Zappa-Hollman, & Duff, 2017, p. 239). It is rooted in language socialization theory (Ochs & Schieffelin, 2011, 2017; Schieffelin & Ochs, 1986) and also interacts with various fields such as writing studies (e.g., Friedman, 2019; Okuda & Anderson, 2018), and sociocultural and ideological dimensions of language learning and teaching (e.g., Diao, 2016; Friedman, 2010; Li & Han, 2023). Thus far, ADS research has portrayed how domestic and international students might be enculturated into the disciplinary ways of “being in the world” by learning to write and speak as expert members of their communities (e.g., Ho, 2011; Huang, 2010; Kobayashi, 2016; Séror, 2014).

A relevant body of research, in line with the current study’s scope, has delved into the socialization of students into oral academic practices (e.g., Guo & Lin, 2016; Ho, 2011; Kobayashi, 2016). Focusing mainly on classroom contexts, scholars have examined students’ ADS into classroom presentations (e.g., Chou, 2011; Kobayashi, 2003; Morita, 2000; Yang, 2010; ZappaHollman, 2007). To exemplify, Morita (2000) investigated English L1 and L2 graduate students’ scholarly article presentations in a Teaching English as a Second Language course. The results of the study showed that the students’ presentation performances were influenced by linguistic, psychological, and sociocultural factors regardless of being native or non-native speakers of English. For instance, some students found it challenging to negotiate their experienced ESL teacher identities with novice master’s student identities while trying to show a firm grasp of theoretical constructs in their presentations. In contrast, others’ socialization leaned towards correct language use to deliver successful presentation performances.

Zappa-Hollman’s (2007) research, on the other hand, focused mainly on the multiple strategies that students employed in their classroom presentations. Students preferred delivering talks on their research interests, preparing speech texts, and rehearsing their presentations with their peers. In a single case study, Kobayashi (2016) focused on a Japanese undergraduate student’s socialization into classroom presentations over an academic year. Findings indicated that the student showed an increasing development across three presentations by observing peers, using teacher feedback, and trying different strategies such as reading from slides, reciting, and paraphrasing the presentation content. Overall, these studies demonstrate that although the students performed the same practice, delivering classroom presentations at undergraduate or graduate levels, they did not show one static, linear, standard socialization trajectory. In order to achieve their presentations, the students were required to negotiate different identities, take agentive roles to observe and try out different strategies, and accumulate their learning with gradual development resulting from trial-and-error. Thus, these findings pointed out the complex and dynamic nature of ADS occurring at the intersections of individual, social, cultural, linguistic, and psychological factors and thus emerging in different forms from various learning trajectories.

Grounding itself in existing research on classroom presentations, the present study shifts focus in two significant ways. First, it gazes at two international doctoral students’ socialization into delivering conference presentations. Like classroom presentations, conference presentations (CP hereafter) are oral academic performances involving disciplinary and genrespecific practices. Due to their scope, CPs can take place in national or international platforms hosting a wide range of audiences. The shifts in CPs context along with variation in attendees might influence students’ presentation preparation processes and thus ADS trajectories. Second, as Kobayashi et al. (2017) and Friedman (2021) stated in their call for research, the majority of ADS studies have directed their attention to TESL classrooms and programs. Thus, the investigation of nonTESL specific settings can reveal “the means by which socialization is institutionally and culturally organized” (Kobayashi et al., 2017, p. 250). Addressing these calls, the present study focused on the socialization experiences of international students in an engineering research team. According to the Open Doors Report released in 2022 (Institute of International Education), $5 4 \%$ of international students majored in STEM fields; however, relatively few studies have investigated the socialization processes of international students in STEM-related fields, specifically computer engineering programs (e.g., Green, 2018; Vickers, 2007). Therefore, the significance of this project lies in the fact that it uncovers the socialization processes of the international engineering students that have been underrepresented in TESOL and Applied Linguistics fields. Utilizing Schieffelin and Ochs’ (1986) language socialization theory that examines how individuals acquire and develop language skills through situated oral interactions, and Goffman’s (1959) dramaturgical theory, which aims to uncover people’s use of impression management in social interactions (Abdul-Messie, 2023), as its conceptual framework, this situated case study investigates two international doctoral students’ ADS in relation to conference presentation preparation sessions in an engineering research team. More specifically, it examines how two international students are socialized into the conference presentation practice during the research team’s extensive conference preparation sessions driven by corrective feedback da discursive socializing practice used to “norm” students’ presentations in expected disciplinary forms.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Language socialization theory

Language socialization (LS hereafter) theory is one of the earliest ecosocial perspectives on language acquisition. It posits that language is both the means for socialization into, for instance, community membership, participation, identity positions, affective stances, and an end product, as through socially and culturally-mediated interactions, learners acquire the language as well (Duff, 2019; Schieffelin & Ochs, 1986). In other words, establishing the connection between social behavior, cognition, and language acquisition, LS theory examines “the process by which novices or newcomers in a community or culture gain communicative competence, membership and legitimacy in the group” (Duff, 2007, p. 310). Even though LS theory has initially located the investigations of contextually situated interactions between childrendnovice membersdand adults or caregiversdexpert membersdat its core (Ochs & Schieffelin, 2017; Watson-Gegeo, 2004), its contemporary understandings highlight the bidirectional nature of socialization, documenting peers and novices as socializing agents and tracing the shifting roles between old-timers and newcomers (e.g., Diao, 2016; Vickers, 2007). Early work on language socialization attempted to examine how children acquired their first language through interactional routines with their caregivers from cross-cultural and ethnographic perspectives. The theory was later adopted to study the additional language socialization processes of speakers or language learners in multilingual settings (e.g., Duff, 2007, 2019; Duff & Anderson, 2015) to identify potential socializing means (e.g., written feedback, oral feedback) (e.g., Anderson, 2021; Burdelski, 2020) in various academic practices (e.g., classroom presentations) (e.g., Yang, 2010; Zappa-Hollman, 2007).

The theory is grounded in three essential premises that theoretically and analytically informed the present study. The first premise relies on the intricate connection between linguistic and cultural knowledge. LS theory proposes that “linguistic and cultural knowledge are constructed through each other” (Watson-Gegeo & Nielsen, 2003, p. 165, emphasis in original). Language is a means to learn cultural knowledge, and culture shapes linguistic expertise by determining the (specific) ways of using language in particular situations. Second, the theory approaches learning as part of everyday routines through which novice learners can witness and practice social situations to master language and interaction through covert or overt participation (Schieffelin & Ochs, 1986). Third, as Watson-Gegeo (2004) suggested, interaction is inherently influenced by larger ideologies which disperse at macro levels. To exemplify, national or institutional ideologies embedded in educational policies can shape the micro-level teaching/learning processes regarding language use (e.g., practicing language purification or adopting bilingual education) in classroom settings (Duff, 2019). Thus, examining how ideologies shape or are enacted in micro-level interactions is crucial.

LS theory has established the groundwork for exploring the role of oral and written corrective feedback in (academic) discourse socialization. In one of the studies conducted in the classroom setting, Friedman (2010) explored the use of oral corrective feedback (CF; hereafter) in Ukrainian language instruction to conceptualize its role in revitalizing the Ukrainian language. Findings indicated that the teacher’s oral CF mainly targeted the students’ use of Russian to promote the national ideology, which aimed to force the purification of Ukrainian language use. Similarly, Howard (2009) documented an elementary school teacher’s use of oral correction routines to socialize students into Standard Thai politeness particles by making students re-say their utterances that addressed teachers. The socialization practice was primarily motivated by the goal of teaching students how to display respect for people in institutionally powerful positions. In one recent study, Li and Han (2023) explored the interaction between oral and written feedback and the identity construction processes of two master’s students. The results showed that the course instructors’ feedback attributed undesirable identity categories to the focal participants (e.g., illegitimate EAL writers). Thus, students engaged in proactive positions to negotiate and reclaim their identities. These studies indicate that CF can be used as a tool to raise individuals according to specific values and ideologies, and even shape or reshape students’ identities.

Corrective feedback is not limited to the ‘correct use of language’ in terms of, for instance, grammar and vocabulary. It also addresses the correction of bodily attunements to culturally specific ways in interactions (e.g., Burdelski, 2010; Moore, 2011). To exemplify, Burdelski (2020) explored the use of oral corrective feedback in Japanese-as-a-heritage-language preschool classrooms in socializing students into the formulaic use of bodily actions (e.g., receiving certificates with two hands, bowing) in graduation ceremonies. Burdelski reported that teachers’ attunements to children’s bodily positions during the rehearsals and correcting them to form actions in culturally specific ways also represented the process in which children learned the norms and values of their heritage culture. On the other hand, one line of research focused on the role of written corrective feedback in students’ socialization into academic writing (e.g., Anderson, 2021; Kim, 2018; Okuda & Anderson, 2018). The findings of these studies have indicated both the struggles students experienced in understanding and interpreting the CF instances and how and why CF was utilized for the learners’ (academic) discourse socialization process (e.g., language use, writing conventions, register). In addition, they iterated the nature of feedback as “a dynamic and socially-mediated activity that involves both feedback receiver and provider in a co-constructed process where meaning is made, negotiated and mediated through that feedback” (Anderson, 2021, p. 135).

One important influence of the LS theory on ADS studies is its emphasis on socializing novices into not only disciplinary ways of writing or speaking but ‘ways of being’ –which might correspond to particular ways of doing or seeing in different disciplines and areas of expertise. Within a vision-oriented research team working on increasing image quality in MRI scans and making it visible to the reader/audience, as in the case of the present study, the respective language and literacy practice that the novices are socialized into can correspond to professional vision. Goodwin (1994) defined professional vision as “socially organized ways of seeing and understanding events that are answerable to the distinctive interests of a particular social group” (p. 1). Goodwin (2018) stated:

Every human community in the widest sense of the term is faced with the continuous, ongoing task of creating simultaneously and reciprocally [1)] the phenomenal objects that populate the environment, that is the focus of their particular work .; and [2)] skilled knowing actors able to recognize and work with such objects in just the ways required to accomplish the activities of their community. (p. 16)

With these statements, the author underscores two elements. First, since the focus of work changes in different communities, people are socialized into different professional visions required to function successfully in their communities. Goodwin (1994, 2018) exemplified this variation with his works on archeologists’ professional scrutiny in teaching novices drawing maps or how geologists were socialized into categorizing minerals through fieldwork with embodied interaction. With “knowing actors” Goodwin might propose that the novice or outsider members might not be equipped with the respective skill or vision and thus fail to approach the practice in ways valued or expected by their disciplines.

Even though LS theory has played a prominent role in ADS studies to uncover how novices are socialized into mostly written disciplinary practices, there is still a dearth of research examining the role of CF in socializing novices into oral practices, and more specifically, into conference paper presentations which might require a combination of socialization into the use of various written, oral and multimodal elements. The following section will present dramaturgical theory as a complementary theoretical perspective to address how conference presentation preparation processes can serve as potential ADS spaces and briefly discuss existing research on conference presentations.

# 2.2. Dramaturgical theory and conference presentations

Goffman (1959) utilized a wide range of theatrical terminology (e.g., performer, stage, masks, cues, props, etc.) in dramaturgical theory with the primary purpose of defining the nature of social interaction. He approached the social world as a metaphorical stage (Zavattaro, 2013), and conceptualized individuals’ social/theatrical performance with two different stage behaviors: Front stage behaviors and back stage behaviors. The front stage behavior referred to the interactional moments in which individuals or interactants communicated in publicly available spaces and considered all the social norms for their performance. The back stage behavior, on the other hand, corresponded to the social space in which an individual could behave in their ‘true selves’dwhen they were mostly on their own or with few others that they genuinely know (some of which could be siblings, spouses, or parents)dwithout necessarily needing to conform to the social norms.

Within the back stage and front stage, which can refer to even different regions of a connected physical space, the performer utilizes different interactional strategies (e.g., changes in gestures, facial expressions, clothing, etc.) for impression management. Even though recent studies have focused on impression management mostly at linguistic levels exploring the discursive strategies of speakers in relation to language use (e.g., File, 2018; Khizar, Iqbal, Khalid, & Rasheed, 2021; Nair, Arshad, Abd Aziz, & Muda, 2021), Goffman (1959) approaches it as a holistic change in one character and depicts impression management as follows: “The moment when a performer leaves the back region and enters the place where the audience is to be found, or when he returns therefrom, for at these moments we can detect a wonderful putting on and taking off of character” (p. 74). Goffman exemplifies this change with a scene from George Orwell (1951) and mentions that a restaurant’s kitchen is a back stage region, completely closed to the customers, where a waiter can present different selves (be it slow or hasty, relaxed or angry). On the other hand, the dining room is a front stage region; the moment the waiter “passes the [room’s] door through, a sudden change comes over him. The set of his shoulders alters, all the dirt and hurry and irritation lesson and diminish” (Orwell, 1951, as cited in Goffman, 1959, p. 74) to conduct impression management. Front stage and back stage regions can also be conceptualized as the binary perception of “performance” and “practice for a performance”. In this respect, previous performances can be seen as practices for future performances.

One challenge of Goffman’s front stage and back stage approach to impression management is that back stage regions might not always be available to observe practices for performances, or documentation of back stage regions might require longitudinal observations of repetitive actions. Corrective feedback might be more visible in the backstage regions where people usually avoid providing feedback in public scenes. For example, researchers might avoid providing CF to conference presenters or in many other formal professional spaces, as such acts challenge the impression management of the presenter in negative ways. Therefore, CF can be observed more commonly in the back stage regions where learners engage in rehearsals for their performances.

To conform to socially routinized performances, individuals use back stage regions to rehearse some social situations by imagining front stage experiences of themselves or others (Goffman, 1959; Hult, 2014). In this respect, the analysis of an individual’s back stage performance is as important as the analysis of the front stage behavior. In addition, in some cases, the back stage performance might be longer than the front stage performance (e.g., actors and actresses preparing for plays). Thus, the back stage region can be regarded as an essential space for individuals’ socialization into roles, situations, or practices. Within Goffman’s dramaturgical model, conference presentations involve both front stage and back stage regions. Comparing the presentation requirements across different disciplinary fields (e.g., biomedical imaging, TESOL, applied linguistics) it can be seen that the duration of the conference presentation genre’s front stage performance can vary between 12 minutes and 45 minutes. However, the back stage preparation processes of CPs require intensive and lengthy work hours, as CPs are highly multimodal, written, or written-to-be-spoken performances.

In the last two decades, scholars have directed their attention to CPs and documented how they are performed by examining speaker’s presentation performances with linguistic and semiotic choices (e.g., Dang, 2022; Fernández-Polo, 2014, 2023; Querol-Julián & Fortanet-Gómez, 2012; Morell, 2015; Reershemius, 2012; Rowley-Jolivet, 2002). Fernández-Polo (2014) utilized corpus analysis and explored English as a lingua franca (ELF) speakers’ use of “I mean” in CPs. Findings indicated that certain discourse markers (such as “I mean”) may negatively impact messaging and perceptions of the messenger to be more about self-justification or misrepresentation rather than the presumed neutrald“scientific”dreporting of information. In a more recent study by Fernández Polo (2023), the examination of speakers’ utilization of directives in CPs and university lectures revealed that university lectures involved directives more frequently than CPs. However, linguistically diverse presenters failed to detect this variation in two genres and demonstrated a preference for employing more directives in their CPs. These findings might show the need for pre-performance training or preparation sessions prior to CPs for linguistically diverse and novice presenters.

Scholars have also analyzed the visual elements in CPs. Rowley-Jolivet (2002) examined the visuals of 90 CPs in three fields (geology, physics, and medicine) and demonstrated that visuals mediated the meaning-making process both for the presenters and the audience. In addition, the author categorized the visuals and showed that sequencing played an essential role in the field of medicine to show, for instance, “tumor progression . in ascending order, from the least advanced stage (T1) to the most advanced (T4)” (Rowley-Jolivet, 2002, p. 35). In short, these studies have pointed out the discursively rich nature of CPs and how scholars engage in meaning-making with language use and semiotic resources. Morell (2015) further explored the multimodal academic discourse by examining the written, verbal, non-verbal elements and body-language modes in four oral presentations to identify the core presentation elements that should be employed to deliver effective CPs. Findings howed that increased dependence on visual modes can make up for shortcomings in verbal expression, and skilled speakers commonly employ a range of overlapping modes that collaborate to convey precise meanings.

a All of the participants are English as an Additional Language (EAL) speakers.

Even though these studies have exemplified the front stage regions of CPs in different disciplines by focusing on the speakers’ performances, there is a dearth of research on the back stage regions where novice scholars might experience socialization through intensive expert-novice or novice-novice interactions with demanding CP preparation processes. Addressing this research gap, the present situated case study examines the academic discourse socialization processes of two international doctoral students in an engineering research team; more specifically, it explores the role of corrective feedback on students’ CP preparation processes. The study addresses the following research questions:

1. How did an international engineering research team facilitate the students’ conference presentation preparation processes with corrective feedback during weekly team meetings?   
2. What aspects of the conference presentation practice were the graduate students socialized into with corrective feedback in an international engineering research team?

# 3. The study

# 3.1. Participants and setting

According to Braine (2002), case studies are “descriptive, dynamic, and rely upon naturally occurring data, and are therefore the most appropriate for studying the acquisition of academic literacy” (p. 66). Therefore, the present study adopted a case study research design and explored the conference presentation preparation processes of an an interdisciplinary international1 engineering research team2 at a research-intensive university in March–June 2018 in the United States. In my design, I approached the team’s practices as one case and examined two students’ (Ryan and Ted, pseudonyms) academic socialization into the International Medical Imaging Conference (IMIC; pseudonym) presentations in particular. I selected Ryan and Ted’s CP preparation processes as the units of analysis because although they both had attended IMIC once in the previous year (2017) with poster presentations, it was their first paper presentation experience as first authors/presenters.

The research team included five international doctoral students (Anne, Ian, Kevin, Ryan, and Ted; all pseudonyms), and their years in the program and previous academic practices varied. The team was co-directed by two international faculty members. Dr. Sanders (pseudonym; DrS hereafter) was from the Computer Engineering (CE) program, and Dr. Mitchell (pseudonym; DrM hereafter) was affiliated with the Biomedical Imaging (BI) program (see Table 1 for participant demographics). The team conducted collaborative, interdisciplinary research projects on magnetic resonance imaging which were presented as paper or poster presentations at local, national, and international conferences and published as conference proceedings and research articles. One of the important features of this research team was that they held weekly meetings. The duration of these meetings varied between 1 and $6 \ \mathrm { h }$ . Students shared their research projects as PowerPoint presentations or roundtable discussions during the meetings and solicited their faculty members’ and peers’ suggestions. These meetings also served as a space to help students prepare for their co-authored CPs. Before every conference, the students who would deliver the presentation as the first author of the project shared the drafts of CP’s PowerPoint slides and poster presentations, and received feedback from their peers and professors.

IMIC was particularly important for the research team as it is one of the largest interdisciplinary and international conventions in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) field serving as a prestigious venue for faculty members and graduate students from engineering departments, radiologists, medical doctors, and employees of private companies. At IMIC, these professional groups meet and present their research projects; they also inform each other about the recent improvements in the MRI field. By meeting with the members of such diverse groups, a research team might find funding sources for their projects, and graduate students can initiate potential future employment plans in companies or academia. The conference receives a large number of attendees; thus, to schedule more presentations, the conference allocates 12 minutes per paper presentation: 9 minutes for the presentation and 3 minutes for the question and answer (Q&A) session. It is important to mention that since the focus is on medical imaging, the conference auditoriums are dimly lit to increase the visibility of the MRI images on speakers’ PowerPoint slides.

# 3.2. Data collection

The data of this study come from a larger ethnographic project conducted over 16 months between March 2018 and June 2019. My data collection procedures were informed by language socialization theory (Ochs & Schieffelin, 2017; Schieffelin & Ochs, 1986), and thus the data were triangulated with multiple sources. According to Garrett (2008, p. 192), “[f]ield-based collection . of a substantial corpus of naturalistic audio or audio-video data” is a crucial methodological feature in researching language socialization. Therefore, I first collected the video recordings of the weekly meetings to document the preparation process in detail. The data analyzed in the current study captured the time frame March–June 2018 when the team prepared for IMIC presentations. Within this period, the research team met 12 times and spent approximately $^ { 2 6 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ $5 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ for the conference presentations of the entire team. $1 5 \ \mathrm { h }$ and $4 4 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ of these meetings were allocated for the CP preparation process of Ted and Ryan, the focal participants of the present study. I conducted ethnographic observations at the weekly meetings and took extensive field notes. I also engaged in online observations to familiarize myself with the conference profile. Third, I conducted two semi-structured interviews with both students by asking descriptive questions (Roberts, 2020) about their previous conference experiences, specifically IMIC experiences, background knowledge about the CP genre, CP preparation experiences in the research meetings, and awareness of socialization strategies that were used by the research team. In addition, I conducted two semi-structured interviews with DrS and asked questions about the important features of IMIC presentations, attendees’ profiles, and the team’s CP preparation practices to better depict whether or how the team supervised the students for their talks. Finally, I collected the PowerPoint drafts of the students’ CPs.

# 3.3. Data analysis

The study drew on discourse analysis (Paltridge, 2021) of research team interaction data to develop an in-depth understanding of the research team’s corrective feedback practices and their roles in the focal participants’ ADS processes. The analysis process started with recursive revisits of the weekly meeting’s transcriptions. I detected the mixture of oral and written CF instances that the research team utilized while reviewing students’ PowerPoint slides in the rehearsals. I chose these CF instances as my focal units of analysis for the two following reasons: 1) they occurred frequently and gave me a rich array to understand how and why the team prepared students for the IMIC presentations, 2) CF formed one of the important interactional routines in the research team. Analysis of these CF units helped me see how the research team members, as socializing agents, used CF to socialize the students into their disciplinary-specific CP practice.

In my approach to CF, I utilized Schegloff, Jefferson, and Sacks’ (1977) definition of correction, which is “the replacement of an ‘error’ or ‘mistake’ by what is ‘correct’” (p. 363), and Ellis’ (2006) definition of corrective feedback as “responses to learner utterances containing an error” (p. 28). In addition, I also benefited from Goffman’s (1971) normativity which refers to “the ground rules that provide the normative bases of public order” to deter any deviant acts (p. 4). Even though Goffman proposes normativity for defining the micro-level social structures of face-to-face interaction, it still enabled me to understand whether or how the research team ‘normed’ students’ CP performance to avoid unconventional acts through corrective feedback.

Upon constructing the detailed transcription of corrective feedback segments for both focal participants (see Appendix A for transcription conventions), I first conducted micro-level analysis to explore “the nature of the error or the trouble source” (Friedman, 2010, p. 352) and how and for what purposes it was corrected. In this stage, I found four types of corrective feedback: explicit correction, and explicit correction with metalinguistic statement, repetition, and clarification requests. Second, I detected the number of error correction instances for both participants to find the common grounds that motivated the research team’s CF instances. Third, I sensitized and categorized the CF types by revisiting existing literature (e.g., Lyster, Saito, & Sato, 2013; Sheen & Ellis, 2011) to form agreed definitions of each CF type. In explicit correction, the feedback provider reformulates the student’s utterance and provides a clear indication of an error (e.g., there is an error). In explicit correction with a metalinguistic explanation, the feedback provider signals an error, provides the correct form, and leaves a metalinguistic comment (e.g., tense use is incorrect). Lyster et al. (2013) define repetition as a teacher’s “verbatim repetition of a student utterance, often with adjusted intonation to highlight the error” (p. 4); on the other hand, clarification requests include statements for clarity (e.g., I don’t understand) and/or asks learners questions for further clarifications (e.g., what do you mean?). Finally, I utilized macro-level analysis by revisiting the interviews with team members, specifically with the research team professor, DrS, field notes, and the team’s conversations to see what macro-level (e.g., conforming to disciplinary language and values, professional vision) front stage CP skills and practices (e.g., presenting visible content, increased audibility) the research team wanted to socialize the students through CF.

# 3.4. Researcher positionality

It is important to acknowledge the potential effects of my researcher positionality to provide the accounts through which I incorporated my emic perspectives into the study. At the time I conducted the study, I was also an international graduate student and a novice academic trying to understand the academic practices of my field. I believe that my “international”

novice scholar identity helped me easily become a member of this international research team. In the initial stages of the study, I was quite visible in the team. However, after they asked me to participate in their research projects as a volunteer and scanned me in their MRI machine, I became less visible, and my involvement turned into a natural process. I believe the invitations that I received from the research team to all the academic and social events can be seen as proof that I was already an insider who was welcomed into their community. One of the challenges that I had was the differences in the academic language use of the team members. To learn their research terminology and procedures, I received help from some of the team members. They were always eager to help. My long-term immersion in this research team helped me master their academic language use, academic practices, and even academic ways of living. I tried to demonstrate these by drawing connections between micro-level interactional elements and macro-level organizational structures.

# 4. Findings

4.1. RQ 1: How did an international engineering research team facilitate the students’ conference presentation preparation processes with corrective feedback during weekly team meetings?

Addressing the first research question, findings indicated that the research team utilized implicit and explicit CF to socialize Ted and Ryan into the expected ways of doing CPs at IMIC. Explicit CF involved explicit correction, and explicit correction with metalinguistic statement, and implicit CF instances occurred with repetition and clarification requests. Table 2 presents the CF types and their numbers of instances for Ted and Ryan.

Explicit correction (see excerpts 3, 4, and 5 for examples of explicit correction and excerpt 7b for an example of explicit correction with metalinguistic feedback) occurred more frequently in the CP preparation processes of both participants. This can indicate the team’s top-down approach to norming students’ presentations in disciplinary-specific ways. Rather than explaining the rationale behind their CF, the team members preferred direct and explicit revisions on the PPT slides and positioned students as novice members with peripheral participation. It should be noted that the team’s top-down approach might have also been motivated by the time constraints in the preparation process.

The table reflects that the number of implicit CF instances constituted less than half of the explicit CF instances. Unlike explicit CF, with implicit feedback instances, the team provided room for Ted and Ryan to actively participate in the correction processes. The implicit CF instance exemplifying “repetition” in Excerpt 1 given below represents one moment in which Ted had the chance to move from periphery to the core of CF practice by fixing the grammar error.

# Excerpt 1

Repetition as implicit CF   
01 DrS: ((reading the sentence on the PPT)) the acquisition time   
02 decrease?   
03 Ted: huh?   
04 DrS: the acquisition time decrease?   
05 Ted: u:h ((smiles looking at the computer, adds -s to decrease))

DrS initiates the CF by reading the sentence on Ted’s PPT slide. Detecting the incorrect conjugation, he puts emphasis on the word “decrease” and uses rising intonation, signaling the problem (line 02). Ted’s response in line 03 shows that he fails to understand DrS’s signal. In line 04, DrS repeats the sentence once again with emphasis and rising intonation. Detecting the grammar error, Ted engages in immediate correction. Excerpt 2 represents another sample implicit CF instance with DrM’s clarification request for the use of colors in Ryan’s figure.

# Excerpt 2

02 different colors.   
03 Ryan: yeah. just (.) just to show different datasets in my network   
04 architecture.   
05 DrM: o:kay. okay. but here it looks s:o busy.   
06 Ryan: so (.) maybe I can change colors. and maybe reduce contrast.   
07 ((starts changing colors))

Detecting the colorful figure, DrM directs a clarification request to Ryan (line 01 – I don’t understand why .) after which he explains the rationale for using multiple colors (line 03). Hearing DrM’s evaluation of the figure colors as “busy”, Ryan first proposes changing colors and then takes action by replacing some colors with softer tones without waiting for any approval from the professors or team members. As seen in both excerpts (Excerpt 1 & 2), with implicit CF the students had chances to take initiatives for correcting errors and exercise expert roles in their CF preparation processes.

4.2. RQ 2: What aspects of the conference presentation practice were the graduate students socialized into with corrective feedback in an international engineering research team?

Using CF instances, the research team socialized the students into three practices: the ways of using language on PowerPoint slides, professional vision, and doing the presentation performance.

4.2.1. Socialization into the ways of using language on PowerPoint slides

Data analysis indicated that while preparing for the CPs, the students were first asked to prepare the initial drafts of their PPTs independently. Then, they shared the slides with the team at the meeting room on a large digital screen. While going over the PPTs, the research group first focused on students’ language use on PowerPoint slides. In the initial drafts of their PPT slides, both students preferred using incomplete bullet-pointed list items of the presentation content on their PPTs (see Figure 1 for the initial PPT slide version).

However, considering the 9-minute duration of the presentations, the research team members wanted the students to use full sentences for two main reasons. The first reason was that “the research team thought the students might forget their presentation speech due to anxiety” (observation notes 06/01/2018). Second, as DrS mentioned, “what [the students] are presenting and what appears on the screen at that moment when [the students] are saying something is going to make it easy for the audience to follow the talk in 9 min” (Interview # 2, 02/28/19). Thus, they first wanted the students to transform bullet-pointed list items into full sentences. Later, the team went over every sentence on the slides to give CF for grammar, punctuation, and mostly sentence clarity to socialize the students into the groups’ preferred ways of using language. Even though all the members were welcome to step in the PPT slide revision processes to provide CF, DrM and DrS took leading roles in the majority of the meetings as the students remained quiet, implicitly leaving the revisions to the professors.

The research team followed explicit correction procedures regarding the grammar and punctuation feedback by simply pointing out the error and replacing it with the correct form. DrM, for instance, corrected indefinite article use on Ted’s slide as follows:

# Excerpt 3

Grammar correction (06/01/2018)   
Trouble source is in boldfaced italics   
01 DrM: ((reading the sentence on the PPT)) an experiment (.)   
02 here an experiment. ((pointing to a experiment))   
03 Ted: ((changing the indefinite article on the slide))

![](img/1d04517c91205a23b2214d9b8e5a03a81b0229029e9a0a98b32c5ee6862d906c.jpg)  
Figure 1. Sample PPT slide from the second draft of Ryan’s presentation.

As seen in excerpt 3, the CF process occurred impromptu when she detected the incorrect use of an indefinite article (an) while quietly reading the sentence on the PPT slide. Receiving DrM’s correction, Ted immediately changed it with the correct form of the article. Similar explicit CF instances were detected with students’ incorrect punctuation use as well. To exemplify, on June 5, 2018, DrS told Ryan to “add an ‘s’ to [the verb] require” to conjugate it in the simple present tense third-person singular form. With these CF interactions, the research team socialized the students into using accurate grammar and punctuation on PPT slides.

Besides these, the research team provided sentence-level CF to the students mainly to increase clarity by reducing wordiness or adding necessary details. The following excerpt exemplifies one of these interactional segments in which the two professors collaboratively discarded wordy phrases.

# Excerpt 4

Reducing wordiness and increasing clarity (06/01/2018)   
Trouble source is in boldfaced italics   
01 DrM: ((reading the sentence silently)) this (sentence) (.) I mean 02 you don’t need to say based on the results shown above (.) 03 you can say based on these results   
04 Ryan: ((Ryan deletes shown above))   
05 DrS: based on the simulation results (.) or something like that. 06 Ryan: ((Ryan integrates the word ‘simulation’))

In line 1, DrM first read the sentence silently and then pointed to the redundant word group. By using modal verbs (don’t need to, can) in lines 2 and 3 in her sentences, she invited Ryan to do the corrections. In line 5, DrS joined the feedback process and contributed to sentence clarity by replacing the demonstrative adjective (these) with a more informative content word (simulation). In this co-constructive CF process of the research team professors, Ryan’s primary role was to apply the feedback as instructed.

Similar CF practices occurred with the involvement of the graduate students as well. More importantly, the students participated using the interactional patterns of the professors; that is, they provided CF by using modal verb(s) and dictated the correction to their peers. The following excerpt exemplifies one of those CF instances where Ian, an experienced student who presented at IMIC before, helped Ted increase sentence clarity in his research gap statement by adding details at the end of the sentence.

# Excerpt 5

Increasing clarity (06/01/2018)   
Trouble source is in boldfaced italics   
First version of the sentence: In many parameter mapping applications, it is not yet feasible to acquire fully sampled data to be used as target/label.

01 DrS: do we need to say (.) u:hm why it is not feasible? or I don’t   
02 know if everybody will be familiar with.   
03 Ian: in the first bullet itself you’re finishing it off (.) you can say   
04 due to long scan time and motion sensitivity (.) that should   
05 cover   
06 Ted: it will go here right? ((he starts a new bullet point))   
07 Ian: no no no. okay. no sub-bullets.   
08 Ted: no sub-bullets.   
09 Ian: use that target slash label ((pointing to the end of the sentence))   
10 Ted: due to? ((typing the words))   
11 Ian: yeah (.) due to extremely long scan time   
12 Ted: long scan time ((repeating and typing))   
13 Ian: and increased motion sensitivity.   
14 Ted: and increase motion sen[sitive ((repeating and typing Ian’s words))   
15 DrS: [he says increased motion sensitivity   
16 Ian: motion sensitivity.   
17 Ted: ((writes motion sensitive))   
18 DrS: there is a d at the end of (.) no (.) sensitivity $( . ) { \pmb y }$ at the end   
19 Ian: v-i-t-y ((spelling out the letters))   
20 Ted: ((writes sensitivities))   
21 DrS: not plural (.) singular   
22 Ted: sensitivity ((repeating the word and revising the suffix))   
23 Ian: and then there is a d after increase   
24 Ted: o:h (.) increased. (.) okay. sorry. ((correcting the suffix))

Revised version of the sentence: In many parameter mapping applications, it is not feasible to acquire fully sampled data to be used as target/label due to extremely long scan time and increased motion sensitivity.

The CF process started with DrS’s question regarding the need to clarify why “it is not feasible to acquire fully sampled data” in many parameter mapping applications. As a response to DrS’s question, Ian provided CF feedback by stating the phrase to clarify the research gap statement (line 03). It should be noted that while giving feedback, Ian used modal verbs and dictated the grammatically correct choice to Ted until he could successfully implement it on the slide; with these structures, Ian, in a way, followed his professors’ CF procedure and routine. This shows that explicit CF with top-down dictations was an integral part of the research team’s culture, socializing the students into the language use specifics of IMIC presentations. When the first and revised sentences are compared, it can be seen that the latter involves the necessary details of the gap statements.

# 4.2.2. Socialization into professional vision

The research team’s CP genre referred to professional vision as using multimodal elements3 of PowerPoint slides through the lens of the audience. Since IMIC conference is home to a large audience, the sessions are usually held in, for instance, auditoriums. Moreover, to increase the visibility of the reconstructed MRI images in research findings, the conference rooms are decorated with dim lighting. Only the PPT slides were the most, if not only, visible items in CPs. In addition, as DrS stated, students might not have the skill to observe the presentation from the perspectives of others.

# Excerpt 6

Looking “from the audience perspective” (02/28/2019)

01 DrS: we think a little bit from the audience perspective of that. it is. one of   
02 the really difficult things to do (.) and especially probably (.) when   
03 you are a student is to be able to look at your presentation from   
04 the perception of an audience member. because you are so: engaged   
05 in your presentation. you work on it. like literally every day. and and   
06 some of the things that you feel like obvious may not be obvious to   
07 the audience.

DrS’s emphasis on the word “really” in lines (02–03) shows that he considered seeing the presentation from the lens of the audience as a challenging task “especially” (line 02) for students because their excessive work on the PPT slides might make it difficult for students to evaluate the presentations from the outsider’s perspectives. As Hood and Forey (2005) put forward, “the success of [a] presentation rests largely on audience approval and a positive judgment of appreciation of the speaker’s contribution” (p. 292). Thus, by helping students construct concise and visually engaging PPT slides, the research team, in a way, socialized the students into ways of setting up relationships of solidarity with the audience.

Findings of the present study aligned with existing research that documented the effective use of multimodal elements on PPT slides to deliver successful classroom and research presentations (e.g., Forey & Feng, 2016; Gray, 2021; Morell, 2015). In every meeting, the research team recursively provided corrective feedback to students regarding the stylistic choices (e.g., font color, font size, page design, etc.) and students’ presentation of reconstructed MRI images in PowerPoint slides when they thought that the content was not presented in the expected visibility of multimodal features. This way, the research team socialized the students into the visibility and visual quality of the PPTs for the audience. Extracts 7a and 7b below exemplify these instances in which the research team socializes the students into using these multimodal elements, specifically, the visible font size.

# Excerpt 7a

Visibility of the font size (06/11/2018)   
01 DrM: then where do we go:? ((points to an equation)) this o:ne between   
02 that line (.) I mean it is all out of proportion? I think (.)   
03 ((starts laughing)) it is an [equation   
04 DrS: [equation   
05 Ryan: ((laughs)) it is a long equation ((everyone laughs))   
06 DrS: I mean (.) having that equation and that size or not having it is   
07 not (.) really any different. right?   
08 Ryan: I made this box ((moving the cursor around the table he put the   
09 equation)) cause I wanted to fit the equations ((everyone laughs))   
10 do you want me to move this equations?

The conversation on font size revolved around an equation Ryan presented in one of his method slides. He showed the equation that he used in his analysis in a box in small font size; thus, it was challenging to see and read it. DrM first pointed out the inconvenient font size sarcastically by saying, “I think it is an equation” (in lines $0 3 \ \& \ 0 4 ^ { \cdot }$ , and DrS simultaneously attended to her feedback. With his stress on “that size” (line 06), he pointed to the illegible font size. He also engaged in a clarification request with his use of “right?” (line 07) inviting Ryan to participate in the CF practice. The students’ laughter might indicate that they could interpret the sarcasm in the professors’ implicit CF (clarification request); however, Ryan was unable to infer the implied meaningdwhich was to make the font size legible. Instead, he talked about the length of his equation by saying it is a long equation (line 05), and he further asked for clarification to see if DrM wanted him to remove the equation (line 10).

# Excerpt 7b

Visibility of the font size (06/11/2018)

11 Kevin: break that equation into two pieces (.) like data consistency on   
12 one line and regularizer in the second (.) then you can make   
13 the entire thing big ((opening his arms side to side))   
14 Ryan: okay (.) I will.   
15 DrS: if you want to have the equation, you can have it (.) it is just   
16 that some people need to be able to read it. ((everyone laughs))   
17 otherwise it is useless.

Realizing Ryan’s confusion, Kevin, a sixth-year doctoral student who delivered a paper presentation at the conference before, started to give instructions to Ryan about presenting the equation with larger font size (line 11); dividing the equation into two sections, and enlarging the font size “making the entire thing big” –which was coupled with his gestures opening his arms (line 13). Ryan confirmed that he would do the changes and immediately started to work on the font size revisions. One last time, DrS pointed out the illegible font size with his words, “people need to be able to read it” (line 16). DrS’s use of “be able to” modal verb can be interpreted as his strengthening the meaning in his explicit correction with metalinguistic feedback; that is, the audience would not be able to read the equation in small font size. With this metalinguistic feedback and use of “be able to”, DrS not only presented the CF as an obligatory act for Ryan but also reiterated the importance of employing the correct font size as a means to establish rapport with the audience. One might wonder about Ryan’s evaluation of DrM’s use of sarcasm in her CF; in the interviews, Ryan stated that;

# Excerpt 8

Ryan’s evaluation of the use of sarcasm (02/28/19)

01 Ryan: oh (.) that is just fine. it is my fifth year in team and we always   
02 say funny things about our work in the meetings (.) and it is   
03 fine for me. I make jokes with my friends sometimes. I know (.)   
04 they don’t mean anything bad. we just have fun.

Ryan’s use of “we” (lines 1 & 4) demonstrates his positioning as a member of the group; similarly, his repetitive use of funny and fun (lines 2 & 4) shows that he does not feel uncomfortable with the team’s use of sarcasm and approaches it as a natural part of team interactions.

It should be noted that both Ted and Ryan talked about the importance of visibility in their pre- and post-CP interviews. For instance, even though Ryan had complained about the intensive revision process with the repetitive changes he was asked to complete on font size and color, he was glad to have made those revisions. He stated that:

# Excerpt 9

Ryan’s evaluation of the preparation process (12/07/18)

01 Ryan: I found all this demanding preparation process very very time-consuming   
02 like make bigger smaller. I said (.) I prefer writing my dissertation. but   
03 it was necessary. in the dark rooms. maybe people can ask more (.) more   
04 when they didn’t see it. it went very well.

Overall, corrective feedback regarding students’ use of multimodal elements occurred frequently in every conference preparation meeting. These continuous feedback/revision cycles positioned students “as novices who had not yet mastered the ability to monitor” (Friedman, 2010, p. 358) their stylistic choice regarding the visibility on the PPT slides. Through the CF practice, research team members collaboratively and simultaneously socialized the students into the professional vision –the ability to detect the correct use of multimodal elements on PPT slides from the audience’s perspectives.

4.2.3. Socialization into “Doing” the presentation “Performance”

As the final stage of the CP preparation process, the research team used the weekly meetings as back stage regions to make students rehearse talks and check their front stage performances. The research team asked students to present the whole CP performance. All the team members avoided any interruptions and timed the presentation duration. They took notes individually during the rehearsal and shared their feedback at the end of the performance (observation notes 06.05.2018). It should be noted that they did not follow a specific template and did not discuss the details of what they would focus on in their feedback before watching the students’ rehearsals. The analysis indicated that the team members provided CF regarding the students’ pronunciation, alignment with the multimodal elements, presentation fluency, and presentation duration to socialize them into their CP performance. Two of these CF instances are exemplified in excerpts 8 and 9.

The analysis indicated that the research team professors provided pronunciation-focused corrective feedback only to Ted when there were instances in which his pronunciation vastly differed from the standard variety. Excerpt 10 demonstrates one of these instances:

# Excerpt 10

CF for pronunciation (07/08/2018)   
Trouble source is in boldfaced italics   
01 DrM: the word application, it is /ˌæp\$lɪ 0 keɪ\$ʃən/, not 02 /ˌæp\$laɪ 0 keɪ\$ʃən/   
03 Ted: /ˌæp\$lɪ0 keɪ\$ʃən/   
04 DrM: yes $( . ) /$ ˌæp\$lɪ 0 keɪ\$ʃən/.   
05 Ted: /ˌæp\$lɪ 0 keɪ\$ʃən/

As seen in the extract, DrM directly told the correct pronunciation of the word by addressing the version that Ted uttered (lines $0 1 \& 0 2$ ). Hearing DrM’s correction, Ted immediately engaged in repetition (line 03) dwhich is a common practice in language socialization enabling both language acquisition and the development of linguistic competence (e.g., Moore, 2011; Watson-Gegeo & Gegeo, 1986). DrM’s confirmation of Ted’s corrected pronunciation with “yes” (line 04) might have reinforced Ted’s acquisition process. This finding concurred with Friedman’s (2010) study on error correction in a Ukrainian classroom where the teacher used “the format not ‘X’ but ‘Y’’’ (p. 359). The student immediately replaced the correct pronunciation with repetition.

Second, as stated before, the conference presentations were carried out with dim lighting, and thus the research team checked students’ use of multimodal elements at the performance. They, for instance, clearly informed the students when they failed to align with the PPTs’ animation orders. The research team members also considered the cursor as one of the essential tools for successful CP performance. When the students delivered their CP rehearsals at the meetings, they explicitly informed them about using cursors to point out the sections they were presenting (observation notes 05/22/2018). The research team treated instances in which the students forgot or had trouble using the cursor effectively as forms of errors and provided CF. Excerpt 11 demonstrates one of those instances:

# Excerpt 11

Using cursor as pointer (07/11/2018)   
01 DrS: so: (.) I hope you will be able to use the cursor to point to things.   
02 ((standing near the screen))   
03 Ted: yeah (.) I was trying to use that but the cursor moves very slow (.)   
04 I don’t know why. ((moving the mouse))   
05 DrS: it doesn’t?   
06 Ian: is this a wireless connection?   
07 Ted: it is a wireless mouse. ((keeps moving the mouse))   
08 Ian: but (.) is it connected to the laptop is the question.   
09 DrS: Yeah. o:h you try to put your own attached. oh I see. yeah (.)   
10 but you need to (.) I me:an (.) when you are talking about all the   
11 noises suppress in the knee example (.) for example you need to   
12 point out what you are mentioning. otherwise nobody will know.   
13 yeah (.) and here you need to point out. ((pointing the places on   
14 the screen))

DrS’ use of “be able to” modal construction combined with “I hope” (line 1) indicates that Ted could not use the cursor efficiently. Although Ted stated that he knew he needed to use the cursor and his failure was due to the trouble he had with the mouse’s wireless connection, DrS still gave feedback to him explaining where and for what reasons he needed to use the cursor in his presentation (lines 9–13). DrS’s insistence shows that his feedback was not a mere suggestion. He wanted Ted to do the performance by using the cursor in specific ways. He was not convinced until he could see that Ted successfully integrated using the cursor into his performance. Overall, the research team paid great attention to students’ rehearsals and utilized CF as a socializing agent in their interactions.

# 5. Discussion

The present study has shown that two doctoral students were spontaneously socialized into academic discourse, spe  
cifically conference presentations, through CF in their interdisciplinary engineering research team meetings. These meetings   
provided the primary interactional space that promoted the ADS processes of the focal participants. The two research   
questions aimed to examine multiple sources of data by examining 1) how the research team socialized the students into the   
conference presentations with CF, and 2) what aspects of conference presentations the students were socialized into with CF. The findings addressing the former research question indicated that the team’s preference for the use of explicit CF   
regulated expert-novice positionings among the members. More specifically, the frequent use of explicit CF positioned the   
focal participants as novice members who were expected to follow and implement the corrections as instructed. This finding

concurs with existing research on language socialization in classroom contexts underlining the role of CF in reflecting the power structures in learner experiences (e.g., Burdelski, 2020; Friedman, 2010).

However, the team also engaged in implicit CF practices through which they provided the space for the participants to shift roles to explain the rationale between their linguistic and multimodal choices and correct their, for instance, grammar, spelling, and vocabulary. Through such shifting roles, the students were given room to claim legitimate positions toward building expertise (Burhan-Horasanlı, 2022).

The findings of the second research question showed that the team’s CF instances were not a compilation of random choices; they were rather deliberate discursive acts motivated by contextual factors. To exemplify, the 9-min presentation duration served as a driving force for the team members to make students use complete sentences instead of bullet-pointed list items. The team’s use of CF was not limited to promoting written or oral aspects of academic discourse but was more motivated towards building abilities, such as seeing from the lens of the audience, to socialize the students into the “ways of being” in their disciplinary world. In this aspect, the ADS occurred in this English as an Additional Language context resembled L1 socialization practices (e.g., Burdelski, 2020; Howard, 2009) where learners were explicitly or implicitly corrected to behave and act according to the valued interactional specifics of communities. In the light of overall findings, the results have drawn two important conclusions about the nature of ADS by adding weight to previous research: 1) ADS as a systematic process; and 2) ADS as a multifaceted process.

# 5.1. ADS as a systematic process

Existing literature on ADS has mostly documented students’ socialization into oral academic practices in ESL/EFL courses (e.g., Domingo, 2021; Dumlao, 2020; Kobayashi, 2003, 2016) or in disciplinary content courses (e.g., history, biology) (e.g., Yamamoto, 2020; Yang, 2010; Zappa-Hollman, 2007). The findings of these studies have shown that students’ socialization occurred gradually, though not in a linear process, with repetitive front-stage practice and trial-and-error. In addition, the studies did not report on students receiving any support or guidance from the course instructors before the presentation.. Therefore, students likely inferred the conventions of presentations with observations and by translating the experience and feedback they received from their course instructors and peers into the expected presentation delivery methods. To exemplify, Kobayashi (2016) demonstrated how Otome’s, a Japanese undergraduate student, presentation performance progressed in three different presentations with trial-and-error, involving her observations of her classmates and the feedback she received from her course instructors after the presentations. These results have portrayed ADS mostly as a form of learning that occurs through repeated in-class practice and the ADS process as a non-linear, rather on-stage trajectory, shadowing the behind-the-scenes moments that might play substantial roles in learners’ academic socialization.

Building on existing research, the present study shows that the ADS process can take place before the on-stage presentation practice through strictly guided rehearsals. The findings depict a highly structured socialization process with systematic sequences of practice, in which the research team first went over the CP slides and then checked students’ presentation performance; both sequences were finely woven with detailed CF that were initiated and mostly co-constructed by both the research team students and the professors. All the team members provided immediate CF without hesitation when they detected forms or elements that did not align with the normed front stage behavior of their community of practice. It should be acknowledged that the research team’s frequent and meticulous use of CF might have resulted from their coauthorship; even though Ted and Ryan were presenters, the names of the co-authoring research team members were still listed on the PowerPoint slide and in the presenters schedule. This ownership might have naturally given co-authors the right to take active roles in Ted and Ryan’s CP preparation processes. Moreover, through these CP performances, the focal students might have encountered their professional and academic communities for the very first time. Thus, it might be the research team’s primary responsibility to help students present their best academic selves for which the team engaged in demanding preparation practice.

# 5.2. ADS as a multifaceted process

Within the last three decades, the applied linguistics field has expressed the emergent need for a multilingual turn, which has inherently led to the advocacy of multicompetence in TESOL/Applied Linguistics (Cenoz & Gorter, 2015; Trentman & Diao, 2021). Scholars have expressed the need to study language learning through the lens of multicompetence by examining how multilingual learners utilize the inextricably linked semiotic resources along with language (e.g., Douglas Fir Group, 2016; Tullock & Ortega, 2017). To exemplify, Canagarajah (2018) has highlighted the rhizomatic system in disciplinary communication as a combination of various semiotic resources and modes. Within these facts, it would be insufficient to approach the ADS process mostly, if not only, at the oral or written-genre level.

As Duff (2010) stated, ADS is a “dynamic, socially situated process that in contemporary contexts is often multimodal, multilingual, and highly intertextual” (p.198). Existing research has documented the complex and multifaceted nature of ADS in relation to oral and written academic practices by blurring the division between oral and written discourse and documenting learner experiences and learner-teacher (or -tutor, -learner) interactions (e.g., Kobayashi, 2016; Okuda & Anderson, 2018). These studies have shown that learners’ socialization was not limited to mastering a practice or acquiring a skill but also involved “ways of being” in the world by adopting different identities or being positioned in various roles (as successful presenters, resilient writers, etc.).

In that sense, the findings of the present study echoes existing scholarship in that ADS is a multifaceted process in which novices are not only informed about forms of knowledge production but also are socialized into “ways of being” in the disciplinary worlds by incrementally learning to “see” and “perform” as the expert or experienced members. It should be noted that students’ knowledge in using multimodal elements or stylistic features in academic tasks is usually taken for granted (Harrison, 2024; Morell, 2015; Wang, Gao, & Cui, 2023), and if not, it is thought that students are naturally equipped with such skills. However, socialization, as seen in this research team and all forms of human learning which take place “in the wild” or in outside of classroom settings, is an “accumulative process” (Ingold, 2001, p. 113) and to be able to develop such professional skills, in some academic communities and for some academic genres, novices might need to be trained explicitly with structured practice. ADS studies should look at such training and professional socialization by exploring the intersections of practice and personal engagement in situated contexts.

# 6. Conclusion

Overall, this article has examined language learning “in the wild” by exploring ADS in an engineering research team in relation to two international students’ preparation for the CPs. Showcasing the team interactions by addressing the connection between corrective feedback and macro-level disciplinary values and practices, the study has shown the rich and entangled feedback practices that the research team employed to prepare the students for their professional presentation performance. It is notably important that the team did not only treat the students’ work solely as oral performances. Instead, they approached students’ ADS processes systematic and multifaceted within a community of practice to where students were oriented to creating a professional product through top-down guidance.

The major contribution of the study is two-fold: First, it explores an underrepresented research population within an underexplored practicedconference presentation preparation sessions. Even though STEM fields constitute the larger portion of international students, there is still a dearth of research exploring how these students are socialized into academic discourse practices through team interactions. Second, the present study contributes to the existing literature on ADS studies by illustrating the systematic and multifaceted nature of academic socialization occurring at the intersections of multiple layers (e.g., multimodal visualization, correct language use, etc.)

It is important to mention the limitations and constraints of the study. This study was situated in only one engineering research team preparing for one kind of academic practice ddelivering conference presentations. Therefore, the study’s findings cannot be generalized to practices or socialization processes involved in other research teams in North Americandor anydhigher education. At the same time, different from past studies of academic discourse socialization, the research team was an actual professional community of practice, which may be more representative of many communities of practice. Another limitation results from the focus of the study. Academic discourse socialization research has foregrounded agency, identity, power and inequality, and bidirectional language socialization, among other issues. Although I did not exclude these issues a priori they did not reveal themselves as outstanding issues in my data.

This study focused on how international doctoral students were socialized into conference presentations with CF in an engineering research team. Shifting the focus and evaluating the ADS process from the opposite end, future research can examine the potential roles of praises in students’ socialization trajectories. They can also explore students’ socialization in the back stage region in relation to learner uptake and outcomes of the socialization process. Even though existing research has exemplified students’ socialization into classroom presentations with concrete uptakes (e.g., Kobayashi, 2016), additional studies are needed to see how and in what forms uptake might occur in alternative academic contexts. Future research should also investigate students’ socialization into other research genres or practices (e.g., lab talk, conference abstract writing, dissertation writing, online interaction, or oral conference interaction). One potentially fruitful line of research can address students’ individual accounts in terms of meso-level sociocultural structures, such as learners’ beliefs, identities, agency, and power (Douglas Fir Group, 2016). Moreover, future research might consider the macro-level structures (e.g., institutional discourses) and examine their impact on the ADS practices and processes of research teams in STEM fields.
