# Abstract

In preparing students for their future discourse communities, the EAP/ESP literature has shown interest in the role of hedges in scientific literature. This interest has resulted in several studies that define and classify hedges, and hypothesize about their purpose. With these as our theoretical basis, we are led to ask “What is the relation to actual practice?” To paraphrase [R. Markkanen & H. Schroder (Eds.) (1997). Hedging and discourse: Approaches to the analysis of a pragmatic phenomenon in academic texts. Berlin: Walter de Gruyter.], a hedge exists when it is mutually recognized by author and reader.

This article represents a very tentative attempt to explore this conceptual space. In Study I, I asked authors to identify hedges in their own texts, and their motivation for using them. In Study II, I presented three of these texts to EAP students (PhD candidates), requesting them to identify the hedges. There are three main findings. Firstly, the authors’ choices of hedges did not coincide with definitions previously reported in the literature. Secondly, the authors did not cite politeness as a general motivation for hedging. Thirdly, there was a great divergence between readers’ and authors’ identifications; in general, readers identified many more instances of hedges than were intended by the authors. If validated on a larger scale, these findings have implications for instruction in reading and writing scientific articles.

# 1. Introduction

A recent focus in applied linguistics has been on hedging as a salient characteristic of scientific writing, reversing previous notions of scientific writing as totally objective (e.g., review of literature in Crompton, 1997; Hyland, 1998a; Markkanen & Schroder, 1989, 1997). Actually, the recommendation to hedge claims can be traced back to one of the earliest rhetoricians of scientific reports, Robert Boyle (c. 1650) who saw hedging as one of the many stylistic devices to project both personal honesty and modesty (Shapin, 1984, cited in Swales, 1990).

The concept of hedging has implications for the field of English for Special Purposes (ESP). Hyland (1998a) emphasizes the scarcity of appropriate material on hedging in current ESP textbooks. The central questions that remain concern the definition of hedge (Crompton, 1997, 1998; Salager-Meyer, 1998, 2000) and confirmation of its purpose. These questions have been argued by linguists on the basis of text analysis alone. However, little attention has been paid to the claim that “[a] text does not contain hedges per se but gets them through the author-reader interaction” (Markkanen & Schroder, 1997: 9). Therefore, we need a greater understanding of authors’ intentions and how readers receive them. To put it very simply, who is to decide when a hedge is a hedge—the linguist, the author, or the reader? In a few cases, analysts have sought clarification of hedged propositions from experts in the same academic field as the authors of the text, but they have not consulted the actual authors of the texts themselves. Hyland (1998a,b) has made significant strides in trying to bridge the gap between theory and practice by interviewing authors. However, while these studies include comments by authors about their texts in general, there is only one example in which an author discusses the hedging in one of his own texts.

Secondly, readers have received only a little more attention, principally by Crismore and Vande Kopple (1997a,b), in a series of studies, and Hyland (2000), which lead to two opposing conclusions. Crismore and Vande Kopple’s subjects were ninth graders in a Midwestern US school who were asked to read two versions of the same passages. The experimental group read a hedged version, while the control group read an unhedged version. The findings showed that the attitudes of the students who read the hedged version became more positive toward the content of the passage even if they had originally been quite negative. The authors’ (Crismore & Vande Kopple, 1997a: 235) explanation for the change in attitude is that expressions of modality “explicitly signal hearers and readers that they have room to judge the propositions for themselves. Hedges, then, stimulate a personal interaction between a producer and a receiver of language in that they signal that the truth of the material is tentative and the receiver has room to evaluate and judge for him/herself.” Also, the hedges had an effect on retention (measured by multiple choice comprehension tests). Students who read the hedged version of the passages learned more than the students in the control condition.

At the other extreme are the findings presented by Hyland (2000) who studied whether readers were at all aware of hedges (rather than whether hedges affected their attitudes or comprehension). In fact, he found evidence that some students did not even notice markers of epistemic modality and those who did, did not consider the hedges when directly asked about the certainty of the author about a proposition. The difference between the studies by Crismore and Vande Kopple and Hyland may be attributed to many of the variables in the experiment; for instance, while the readers in the first set of studies were native speakers of English in junior high school, the readers in the second study were non-native speakers of English, undergraduates at a Hong Kong university, majoring in English.

The next step in this research would be to compare linguists’ judgments of the form and function of hedging and the authors’ judgments in regard to their choices and motivation in their own texts. The second step would be to ascertain if EAP readers recognize the hedges cited by the authors. In other words, do EAP readers read the intentions of the author?

First, I will briefly review some of the recent literature devoted to linguists’ conceptions of hedging. The two major issues are:

A. form: how can we define hedges? What lexicogrammatical criteria can be applied? B. function: what is the author’s motivation for using hedges?

# 2. Linguists’ conceptions of hedging

# 2.1. The question of form

Hedging, appropriately, is a concept that evades definition. Since the extensive literature on the topic has been thoroughly reviewed in Hyland (1998a), I will provide only a brief summary. The consensus among current analysts in general is represented by Hyland’s (1998a: 1) view of hedging as the expression of “lack of complete commitment to the truth value of an accompanying proposition” regardless of whether the author is actually committed. Therefore, the most commonly accepted type of realizations of a hedge are those that select an epistemic modality structure, e.g., “a possible interpretation of this finding may be that.”

If we define a hedge as any device that qualifies the speaker’s commitment to the truth of the proposition he/she utters, almost any linguistic item or expression can be interpreted as a hedge. In addition to epistemic modality, at least 50 other types of structures have also been categorized as hedging (Markkanen & Schroder, 1997). To make matters even more confusing, in some cases, the literature gives equal weight to opposing options:

1. both certainty and uncertainty—“I’m sure the earth is round” as well as “I’m not sure the earth is round” (e.g., Halliday, 1985; Skelton, 1997; while Hyland, 1998a,b, considers expressions of certainty as boosters rather than hedges);   
2. attribution—whether the agent is realized or deleted in a passive construction; both personalization (“I argue that smoking causes cancer”) and depersonalization (as in “the findings suggest that smoking causes cancer”) (e.g., Crismore & Vande Kopple, 1997b; Namsaraev, 1997; cf the unhedged form: “Smoking causes cancer”)   
3. approximators—structures that blur distinctions of quantity and frequency, such as “approximately” (Dubois, 1987; Hyland, 1996; Myers, 1989; Prince, Frader, & Bosak, 1982; Salager-Meyer, 1994).

4. qualification—the term I will use to refer to Brown and Levinson’s (1987: 145) definition of hedges as structures that span the continuum between all and no cases, i.e., a hedge “modifies the degree of membership of a predicate or noun phrase in a set; it says of that membership that it is partial or that it is more true and complete than perhaps might be expected” (italics in original text; bold font added by author). This definition would include strengtheners such as “these proteins become completely X” and weakeners such as “these proteins become, at least partially, X.”

A more functional position is represented by Crompton (1997), who proposes the following test for determining whether or not a proposition is hedged. Crompton asks, “Can the proposition be restated in such a way that it is not changed but that the author’s commitment to it is greater than at present? If yes, then the proposition is hedged. (The hedges are any language items in the original which would need to be changed to increase commitment)” (Crompton, 1997: 281). He then applies this test to the following structures characterized by others (above) as hedges (italics):

1. Little information exists on the frequency and severity of the disorder.   
2. [X] poisoning is usually a clinical diagnosis.

Crompton concludes that removing the hedges would not increase the author’s commitment but would alter the propositional content, as the following show:

1. information exists on the frequency and severity of the disorder.   
2. [X] poisoning is a clinical diagnosis.

In contrast, he would classify statements such as “I suggest that pigs fly” as hedged, because commitment can be strengthened by deleting “I suggest”, while the basic proposition is unchanged.

# 2.2. The question of function

Basing their work on studies of everyday communication, researchers in academic texts have attributed motivation for expressing either fuzziness or uncertainty to a desire to dilute assertions, driven by exigencies of politeness, protection, or politics (Markkanan & Schroder, 1997). In scientific genres, the need to appear modest is also recognized as a prime motivation for hedging (Myers, 1989; Nikula, 1997).

The function of hedging in a specific scientific genre (rather than academic writing in general) is proposed by Dubois (1987). In biomedical conference presentations, fuzziness, in the form of imprecise numerical expressions, serves to background previous theories, especially those the author believes are erroneous. For instance, the statement “the standard measurement is considered to be. about twelve” foregrounds the author’s own precise statements of measurement (Dubois, 1987: 538).

Although hedging clearly derives from interpersonal considerations, the exact motivation is still cloudy. On the one hand, hedging in academic texts can be seen as a purely rhetorical strategy. Hedges allow for a more active role for the reader: “meaning negotiations and reformulations for both speaker and hearer” (Nikula, 1997: 193), while categorical assertions imply an assurance in the certainty of arguments that require no feedback, relegating readers to a passive role (Hyland, 1996: 446).

On the other hand, Myers (1989) suggests a much deeper interpersonal exigency when scientific texts are considered. If we accept the theory that a new claim is, in some sense, an effrontery to the audience because it disturbs the status quo, or as often happens, seeks to redress a wrong committed by a previous researcher, a politeness strategy is called for. One must frame one’s claims as tentative until accepted by the entire discourse community for whom the findings are relevant.

In sum, linguists have classified certain forms as hedges and postulated about the motivation for hedging. While there is consensus about some areas, others are still the subject of disagreement.

# 3. Authors’ conceptions of hedging—Study I

The purpose of the first study was to ascertain the forms that authors identify as hedges in their own texts.

# 3.1. Method

Volunteers were recruited through an e-mail discussion group for academicians and through personal contact. The resulting sample was composed of twelve men and two women, of whom, nine were native speakers of (US) English. Professionally, thirteen respondents were senior faculty members and one was a senior member of a research institution. The academic fields were divided between physical sciences (neuroscience, medicine, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, atmospheric science, and geophysics), and social sciences (sociology and educational psychology).

The volunteers received the following instructions by e-mail or regular mail:

1. Please select one of your published articles that is based on empirical research. (See Appendix for list of journals in which the articles were published);   
2. Underline or highlight the places in the Introduction and Discussion sections where you toned down or limited the generalizability of your claims. Within these, circle the language (word, phrase or sentence) that accomplishes this;   
3. On a separate sheet of paper, indicate why you limited or toned down each claim.

Three points should be noted regarding the wording of the task. I used the phrase tone down instead of hedge because the scientists I interviewed in a pilot study interpreted hedge only in the pejorative sense of evading responsibility. In other words, had I asked “Where did you hedge in this article (i.e., the article chosen by the participant for analysis)?”, I am confident that the common response would have been “I never hedge”. Secondly, I directed the authors to analyze their own propositions only, not those that related to reported literature. Therefore, “Jones suggests that $\mathrm { X }$ is true” would not be included, but “I suggest that X is true” would be. Finally, I did not give authors any list or hint as to what to consider as an instance of toning down.

# 3.2. Findings

# 3.2.1. Heightening claims

Even though the sample was self-selected for people who were willing to be frank about their motivation, the first finding was surprising. Four authors, three of whom were native speakers of English, stated that instead of toning down their claims, they sometimes toned them up (although one person realized she had done it unintentionally). The term toned up was initiated by the authors. Below I present two of the many instances provided by each of the authors. The actual quote from the published article (A) is followed by the author’s comments (B):

In the first example, the author not only tones up his claim but does so by means of understatement, regarded by linguists (Hubler, 1983) as a hedge, the very opposite of toning up.

Author 1, male, non-native speaker, theoretical physics

(A) “At this point it is still hard to say how seriously all this [i.e., the author’s conclusions] can be taken, but there may be a grain of truth in it.” (Discussion section)   
(B) “This is NOT toning down; this is a classical example of persuasion and advertising by understatement. That’s what it was meant to be.”

Author 2, male, native speaker, psychology

(A) “[X] and [Y] are generally seen as two intertwined kinds of knowledge. We untangle them, re-explore them, and then re-twine them with somewhat different relations. In short, we propose to change the traditional ways of understanding their relations.” (Introduction section)   
(B) “I did not try to tone down anything I wrote. In fact, I did my best to emphasize the differences between my model and others’ model of the topic under discussion. I presented an alternative to the conventional view and in order to make the differences clear, I stretched them to their limits without distorting the positions of those who hold the conventional view and without distorting my own views.”

# 3.3. Linguistic structures chosen as downtoners

When they did indicate a toning down of their claims, the respondents selected some traditional hedges (i. e., designated in previous research, such as epistemic modality) and some non-traditional hedges. To collate the former data, I classified all the traditional hedges that were actually realized in the respondents’ texts and tabulated whether respondents then identified them as downtoners.

The findings show variations in the way that the respondents regarded traditional hedges. Although they used modality in various forms copiously, (as in “may synthesize”), respondents did not include $50 \%$ of the occurrences as downtoners. The second category, attribution, consists of any device that shows that the reality in the proposition has somehow been mediated by human cognition, evaluation, or judgment, (“I think that X is true” rather than $^ { 6 6 } \mathrm { X }$ is true”). While personal attribution was used by eight authors, only one person labeled it a downtoner. More strikingly, the authors, unlike linguists, did not consider that granting cognition to an inanimate actor (as in “the findings suggest”) was a downtoner. However, some (but not all) authors who used them regarded as hedges items in the category qualification including strengtheners and weakeners, i.e., those structures that span the continuum between all and no cases.

When we turn to the discourse stratum, we see that a few authors identified particular moves as downtoners on the basis of their function only. For example, the following move, in which the author justifies her procedure, was considered a hedge because its function is to avert potential criticism, even though no specific hedging structure is realized: “In the interest of presenting the mapping sentence with maximum accuracy, the revised percentages were included.” When a specific hedge structure was realized, respondents also identified downtoners on the basis of function; that is, they considered the entire assertion as a hedge, rather than specific words or phrases within them. Furthermore, strong (such as 1) as well as weak claims (such as 2) were considered downtoners:

1. “The observation. strongly supports the contention”   
2. “. even if the association is not particularly strong.”

In addition to the traditional hedges, authors selected techniques for toning down that have not been mentioned in the literature. The first technique is invisible to the observer; only the author knows that s/he chose silence (i.e., refrained from stating a claim) or from using a stronger evaluation. In the following example, the author identifies “good” as a downtoner, because she refrained from using “excellent”: “These results constitute good evidence of the content aspect of the construct validity. of the scale.”

Another reported technique to tone down claims was to select definite articles or demonstratives, in order to limit the generalizability of the results to the study. This is illustrated by Author 3, who used the phrase ”these kindergarten actors” to limit her claims to the phenomena she observed, but in other places, unconsciously lapsed into generic nouns such as “teachers’ accounts showed that the schedule was both the basis for the work they were doing and the criterion for evaluating their performance. Children’s accounts, on the other hand.” (discussion section). According to the author, generic nouns imply that her conclusions generalize to all teachers or children.

# 3.4. Motivation authors acknowledge for hedging

Each respondent was asked why s/he used each downtoner; thus, a different motivation could be ascribed to each hedge in a particular text The respondents did not ascribe their use of uncertainty to considerations of politeness, modesty, or immediate audience considerations, (although one can assume that everyone is ultimately constrained by the anticipated reaction to their claims). Instead, the respondents indicated that uncertainty was a more honest reflection of reality, by saying, for instance, “not enough evidence” or “to limit the generalization”. These reasons seem to imply that the author is not trying to say less than s/he believes but is trying to say only what s/he believes.

Only one author selected uncertainty on the basis of modesty; he used a modal (“may serve as a prototype”) and lexical verb (“suggest a new approach”) “so as not to exaggerate the importance of the finding.”

When we consider structures other than modality, we find that two methods of toning down were related to saving one’s own face: passivization and qualification. Respondents intentionally used passivization to avoid naming the agents. Equally, they qualified their claims (italics below) for reasons of self-protection, as in the following example:

“It is possible to assess [X] with a relatively simple set of test items.” Author’s comment—“Some might not consider them absolutely simple.”

# 4. Readers’ conception of hedges—Study II

The purpose of the second study was to see if readers identified as hedges the structures chosen by the authors. Participants were 63 students enrolled in an EAP course in scientific writing for PhD candidates. I presented a text in medicine, social science, or exact sciences to a group of students in each field. The readers saw an unmarked text and were asked to underline words/phrases/statements by which they thought the author had toned down his/ her claims. This task was performed as part of a typical lesson, to introduce the topic of “toning down”, which had not been taught in this class. (It is unlikely that the students had encountered hedging, per se, in their previous education).

Students were not informed of the research purpose of the task nor were they given examples of what I meant by toning down.

# 4.1. Findings

In general, the authors’ and readers’ responses did not match the structures identified as hedges by linguists (traditional hedges). In each text, there was more agreement between readers and linguists than between authors and linguists. As an example, Table 1, shows the relevant parts of one text, from the introduction to a sociology research report that was presented to 31 social science students. There was no difference in fonts or visual cues in the original version but for the sake of illustration, I have highlighted the hedges indicated by each group in bold.

The first column shows, in context, structures that have been defined previously as hedges in the literature, comprising the total realized hedges in the text. The second column represents the structures that the author identified as his toning down while the third column shows structures that the readers thought represented toning down by the author.

# 4.1.1. Readers vs. linguists

We can interpret Table 1 as showing that readers identified $50 \%$ of the traditional hedges or that they did not identify $50 \%$ of the hedges. Another difference between

the readers of Text 1 and linguists was that the readers added a structure to the list of traditional hedges: “sociologically incomplete” (see sentence 2).

# 4.1.2. Authors vs. linguists

The most striking contrast is between the identifications by authors and by linguists, as discussed in Study I. In all three texts, the authors identified as toning down very few of the structures commonly accepted as hedges in the literature. For example, in Text 1 (see Table 1) the author identified as toning down only 3 of the 16 traditional hedges he actually used. For instance, he did not point out “suggest” (a lexical verb of uncertainty) as a hedge nor did he consider attribution (“we”) personalized or depersonalized (“the first framework”) as hedging.

# 4.1.3. Readers vs. authors

In all three texts, the divergence is greater between readers and authors than between readers and linguists. Compared to the authors, the readers identified many more structures as toning down, out of the total realized in the text. At least four readers in each group recognized more of the traditional hedges than did the authors, e.g., epistemic modality in all its forms—adjectives, adverbs, nouns, modal verbs—as well as attribution, certainty as well as uncertainty, attribution, and qualification as instances of toning down. There were mixed results and no unanimous agreement on any one instance of toning down. In the two texts not shown, some approximators were recognized as downtoners and some were ignored. However, in Text 1, expressions of imprecise quantities (e.g., “approximately”) were not considered as toning down by either readers or the author.

In two texts, the readers recognized some but not all of the authors’ hedges. The text shown in Table 1 represents the most extreme of the three in that almost no readers recognized the author’s hedges (“of course” ${ } = 0$ ; “essentially” $= 1$ ; “even if” $= 2$ ).

# 5. Discussion

In this exploratory study, I have examined the degree to which traditional hedges, i.e. as defined by linguists, play a part in practice for actual authors and EAP readers. The general finding is that the authors’ account of hedges and hedging diverged greatly from that of linguists, while the readers’ views were more consonant with the linguists’ interpretation. Thus, there was great divergence between the authors’ hedging intentions and the readers’ recognition of these intentions. A corollary of this is the possibility that the readers read some claims as more hedged than the author intended, at the same time missing some of the intended hedges in other claims. A plausible explanation for the discrepancy between authors and readers is that the authors viewed hedging as a structure deliberately selected to perform the function of toning down, while the readers held a formal view, which selected structures that fit the traditional classifications such as modality.

For one, the authors considered very few of the traditional hedges they actually used as downtoners; for instance, they did not cite attribution (whether personalized or depersonalized) as a hedge and recognized epistemic modality in only half the instances. It may be that attribution and modalized propositions have become institutionalized in the register for research reports and therefore, the unmarked form. Perhaps the authors regarded a structure as a hedge only if it were optional (intentional). For instance, attribution (“we”) is obligatory in some of the assertions in the text segment shown above (“we shall show” compared to “we suggest”) and modality is obligatory in realizing a claim (Dubois, 1997: 16). The difference between a fact and a hypothesis or even a generalization from that fact is the selection of a hedge, as the second sentence illustrates: “The analyses reveal that extra-community employment is more limited among women than men. Women’s tendency to settle for local jobs may be seen as .” (Text 2 [emphasis added by author])

While most authors discarded some traditional hedges, two authors added new categories: the inclusion of the definite article—“The teachers’ [in this study] accounts showed” instead of “Teachers’ accounts”—and understatements, which the literature considers as uptoners (Hubler, 1983).

The more specific findings question some common assumptions in the literature, and strengthen others. For one, some authors emphasized that they sometimes toned up their claims as well as, or perhaps, instead of, toned them down. Moreover, authors did not acknowledge politeness as the motivation for expressions of uncertainty, which raises questions about Myers’ ascription of hedging in general to politeness theory. These questions are consistent with the view expressed by Hyland (1998a: 69), which rejects “politeness as an adequate explanation for the use of hedging in science.” One can also ask whether a theory of motivation based on conversational encounters is applicable to the arena of scientific writing, where so many personal elements might compete with the need to be polite. In the real world, scientists worry about their positions and prestige, the need to get grants, be promoted, and so on, which might drive their needs to enhance, rather than mitigate, their research work. The politeness explanation also ignores the agonistic side of scientific writing that aims to refute other researchers. If face is involved at all, it is just as likely protection or even enhancement of the author’s face as deference to the face of the audience that may be the motivation. Conflict avoidance, in the guise of politeness, may not be the top priority. In fact, in Tannen’s (1999: 268) opinion, “the standard way of writing an academic paper is to position your work in opposition to someone else’s, which you prove wrong.” In general, the finding that politeness was not the dominant motivation for hedging seems in accord with these realities.

Furthermore, each type of hedge was attributed to a different motivation rather than to a common motivation. Thus, uncertainty, realized by modality, was, in the authors’ view, a reflection of the truth, rather than a conscious toning down of a claim. Uncertainty was expressed when a categorical assertion would not be an honest representation of the data. This interpretation is in accord with Banks (1994) and Salager-Meyer (1994). Instead of saying less than they mean, scientists are actually saying precisely what they mean. Their reluctance to express unqualified claims is not always in deference to interpersonal considerations.

Other findings also indicate that some authors apparently had a functional definition of a downtoner in mind; they looked beyond specific lexico-grammatical forms to the discourse stratum and identified complete assertions as downtoners (e.g., “even if the association is not particularly strong .”). In some cases, these assertions were downtoners in function only, realizing no hedging form. Therefore, a definition of hedges, which recognizes only specific forms realized within a proposition, such as Crompton’s (1997) is incomplete. The definition should also include hedges realized through discourse structures (moves), when the intent is to strengthen or weaken claims. The inclusion of hedges on the discourse stratum has been posited by Hyland (1998a), Lewin (1998) and Lewin, Fine and Young (2001). For instance, in one type of genre structure (move) in discussion sections of research text, authors raise potential counterclaims and respond to these counterclaims by either accepting responsibility for a limitation or by dismissing the counterclaim, as in: “However, an inspection failed to support the latter [alternative] interpretation” (Text 3). In this example, as in examples provided by some authors in the present study, the act of hedging is accomplished without realizing a specific lexicogrammatical hedging structure. In sum, a possible conclusion from the findings of Study I is that the realization of a hedge in a claim is not always intended for the purposes of reducing commitment and reducing commitment can be accomplished without realizing a specific lexicogrammatical hedge.

As far as readers’ reactions are concerned, the readers in Study II generally noticed hedges per se but were not always aware of the author’s intended hedges.

Crismore and Vande Kopple’s (1997a,b) readers not only noticed hedges but were affected by them. In contrast, Hyland’s (2000) readers often did not notice hedges and when they did, were rarely affected by them. The differences in the design of these studies make them difficult to compare. For one, the participants in the Crismore and Vande Kopple studies were L1 readers, while those in Hyland’s study were L2 students. In the two studies involving L2 readers, the participants in the present study were highly sophisticated PhD students, whereas the readers in Hyland’s study were undergraduates who failed to recognize words such as “speculate”. Similarly, the goals differed. My intention was to compare the readers’ and authors’ definitions of hedges, while the purpose of the other two studies was to determine the cognitive or affective influence of hedges, which necessitated different methods. I asked readers directly to indicate hedges, while the other two studies indirectly tested whether readers processed them. I have no data as to whether my readers later processed the hedges in making decisions about the certainty of the claims. However, there is some congruence in the fact that hedges were often invisible to Hyland’s students and that authors in Study I intended only some of their realized hedges as hedges. Both findings are consistent with the explanation that hedges in scientific claims are the norm or even obligatory and, therefore, are not given special attention. Further support for this explanation that readers attend to the unusual is Hyland’s (2000) finding that his students had much less trouble in recognizing and processing of markers of certainty (such as “definitely”), which occur only $33 \%$ as often as hedges in scientific articles (Hyland, 1998b).

# 5.1. Limitations

Since the findings are based on a small sample of authors and readers, no generalizations can be made but they point to new directions for inquiry on a larger scale. Furthermore, authors and readers were not asked about hedging but about toning down. However, previous research has agreed that toning down is one strategy for hedging. At the minimum, therefore, these findings indicate awareness of at least one set of the total class of hedges. In addition, some responses seemed to reflect awareness of hedging, rather than toning down, e.g., “of course” (see above).The third possible limitation is that the authors were not totally frank about or even aware of their motivations. But the authors’ sample was self-selected for people willing to reveal their motivation. Secondly, some of their responses (toning up) were not in the direction of social desirability. Thirdly, authors carefully discriminated among different kinds of motivation, which indicates a desire to be accurate.

Study II involved a greater number of participants but did not inquire about their reasoning. It is possible that the readers found more hedges in the research task than they would have in their ordinary reading because the task required them to focus on this element, or that they focused on form because the task took place in an EAP writing class. The fact that patterns emerged showed that there were some guiding principles in readers’ minds as to what constitutes a hedge. Thus, we know what these readers regard as a hedge, although we do not know if they regard all the indicated hedges as equally salient. In any event, this limitation could explain identifying too many hedges but would not account for one of the main findings—that the readers overlooked some of the authors’ intended hedges.

# 5.2. Implications

This study has implications for research in linguistics and for EAP There is great inconsistency in the definition of hedge as reported in the literature, which I have only alluded to here. Perhaps a valid way to ascertain which structures are hedges in practice would be closer collaboration with authors, in which they analyze their own texts and identify specific hedges. Furthermore, such findings would have to guide our instruction of EAP students in reading and in writing scientific papers. Hyland (2000: 191) remarks that “ $40 \%$ of responses marked [statements] as one or more category higher (i.e. more certain) than my own classifications.” This again highlights the dissonance between the possible intentions of the author, the perceptions of the reader, and the theoretical judgments of linguists.

Furthermore, it seems reasonable to disengage the concept of hedge from hedging, with the former referred to as downtoner. This would release it from its pejorative emotional baggage and allow it to be taught as a necessary signal for certain types of speech acts. For instance, a choice of an inanimate agent, such as “the findings” or “the data” as the subject of “suggest” seems to be so accepted that “we suggest” would constitute a glaring deviation. Hedging, on the other hand, could be reserved for the optional use of downtoners; (see below) or for moves that perform the function of hedging. The extent to which any syntactic or lexical structure is obligatory or optional could be assessed by studying its pattern of occurrence within a data bank of millions of actual texts (Hunston & Thompson, 2000).

The results indicate that EAP readers may be reading many more hedges into the text than the author intended. The distinctions made above may help students to distinguish between intentional hedges and hedges that are inherent in the speech act. They can be advised to consider modality as a signal to distinguish a fact from a non-fact (generality, claim, or hypothesis).

Although the definition of hedge is still amorphous, it is clear that hedging is an important aspect of scientific writing. Moreover, analysts agree that hedges make a text more reader- friendly since they allow for negotiation between the writer and the reader. Hence, students do have to learn which kinds of assertions should be hedged, e.g., criticisms of others’ work, and which should be strengthened, and the concomitant lexicogrammatical structures to accomplish these functions.

We now understand that rhetorical strategies are culturally bound and must be explicitly taught to EAP students. Research into other cultures (e.g., Finnish students, Ventola, 1997) has claimed that EAP students have difficulty with hedging techniques, either because their L1 discourse conventions do not include hedging, or because they just have not been taught a wide variety of techniques in English. My experience with novice L2 writers shows that they may not realize that certain claims should be mitigated, e.g. the following text from a student’s introduction: “Our research is focused on the investigation of vorticity dynamics in a homogenous and isotropic flow and that is the reason why so many people are interested in our research.” In this case, the writer should tone down a claim that the English speaker would consider rather immodest (cf “that may be the reason our research has generated some interest”).

This study suggests that teaching students to modify all claims and observe politeness as a general constraint does not necessarily reflect the actual practices of the scientific community. Scientists also tone up their claims. We have to explain the actual norms of science, because an overemphasis on hedging may influence students to be overly cautious, which would have serious impact on their careers. In order to understand toning up we also need much more feedback from authors. Moreover, both Study I and Study II represented a very heterogeneous group of disciplines. Future studies should compare authors’ intentions and readers’ perceptions in various academic disciplines.
