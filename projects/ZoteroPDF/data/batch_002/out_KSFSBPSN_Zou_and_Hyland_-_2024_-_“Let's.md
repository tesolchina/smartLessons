Explainers Engagement Audiences Popular science Covid-19

Explainers are a relatively new genre increasingly used to provide readers with background information, disseminate specialised knowledge and enhance public outreach. These functions were particularly crucial during the Covid-19 pandemic which demanded accurate and widespread health-related information to counter considerable social media disinformation. Based on 81 academic and 81 popular explainers on the topic of Covid-19, we explore how writers employ a range of engagement features to assist them to hook and inform readers of important public health information. The results reveal considerable use of engagement features in both forms of the genre as a way of establishing interpersonal rapport with audiences to better inform them of key issues. Popular explainers contained more features overall and had higher frequencies of reader-mentions, directives and personal asides while academic explainers emphasized shared knowledge and addressed the audience with questions. These variations are explained in terms of the experiences of writers with specific persuasive forms and of the slightly different audiences. The findings are a contribution to the literature on engagement and to an understanding of communication at a time of public health crisis.

# 1. Introduction

The Covid-19 global pandemic continues to reverberate around the world as economies and populations slowly recover from the worst public healthdisaster in over a century. With some 700 mllon cases and 7 million deaths worldwide, the crisis mobilized the world scientific community leading to a surge of research to understand and contain the virus (Hyland & Jiang, 2021; Riccaboni & Verginer, 2022). This produced a tsunami of Covid related publishing, with the WH0 Covid database containing 880,000 articles. At the same time, the pandemic has aso placed a premium on disseminating health-related research to the general public. In the climate of social anxiety, there has been an urgent drive to make scientific knowledge more accessible to the general public, and one consequence of this is people turning to new digital genres such as the explainer.

The explainer is ajournalistic genre which provides background information to help lay audiences understand complex news topics (Pippenger, 2014). The New York Times describes it thus:

.. a mobile-friendly article format designed to demystify thorny topics. The articles, known as explainers, are structured as a series of questions and answers, with each response flowing logically into the next. Explainers break down tricky news topics quickly and clearly - and answer questions that readers are searching online. (Bahr, 2023)

Online news explainers, often with the aid of visual resources, offer academics a new way to recontextualize their research and render topics such as health-elate ssues more accessble to lay people. To achieve this, writers draw on various discursive trategies to present information, generate affit, and engage audiences. This i particularly crucial in the ovid-19 context, as explainers help the public navigate the deluge of multiple and often fragmented news updates (Spilioti, 2018).

Academic explainers transform the scientific knowledge of journal articles into information for the mases. In this study we explore how writers communicate complex information to a heterogeneous, and ofen lay, readership in two forms of explainers, focusing explicitly on the Covid issues. Using Hyland's (2005) engagement model, we compare key engagement indicators in 81 academic Covid-19 website explainers and 81 popular ones. Specifically, we address the following questions.

(1) How do writers seek to engage their readers in two forms of Covid-19 explainers? (2) How do engagement practices differ in academic and popular explainers? (3) How can we account for these differences?

In answering these questions, we hope to clarify the engagement practices involved in an under-explored new digital genre to she light on explanatory strategies used to persuade readers, generate solidarity, and shape ther understating of the pandemic. In doing s we also intend to show how explainers contribute to a wide range of new practices in health communication.

# 2. Explainers

Explainers are published online by mainstream news outlets such as The New York Times and BBC News and on science wesites such as Nature, while dedicated explainer websites such as Vox.com, have also emerged. They are written by either journalis or experts in a specific research area, with the two forms of explainers, journalistic and academic, containing different prestation styles to explain and disseminate health-knowledge. Esentiall, however, they are rigorously researched reporting presented more informally than either traditional academic papers or journalism written in a more accessible, conversational way.

While a relatively new genre, they are rooted in traditional journalism. Explainers tend to be structured around questions that cannot be answered by a quick Google search, providing the public with background information about current events (Spilioti, 2018) or thorny ssues, and can be texts or videos which clarify specialised concepts and contexts and explain how something works. They inform readers of the How and Why (Cartagena, 2015). Because of this informing role, explainers can also counteract disinformation (Graves & Cherubini, 2016) and provide background on controversial isues (Spilioti, 2018), particularly on complex news stories (Umbricht & Eser, 2016). Mainstream news media tend to publish explainers on popular topics in different formats (e.g., blog entries, webtexts, videos) with the purpose of unpacking isues of the day for readers and watchers. Thus the explainer website FiveThirtyEight com, for example, explains its mission as follows:

We use data and evidence to advance public knowledge - adding certainty where we can and uncertainty where we must. 3

While The New York Times states the purpose of its explainers to be:

Explainers break down tricky news topics quickly and clearly -- and answer questions that readers are searching online.4

Explainers have proved to be a powerful avenue for dissemination of health knowledge during the pandemic, a particularly important role where the general public is constantly bombarded with news updates, and fake news, related to the disease (Luzon, 2022). By clarifying technical terms and offering background information, explainers help the general public to better understand the multiple sources of Covid news. They also help promote the democratization of scientific information and can directly impact public opinion and perhaps the ability to cope with the virus. The UK Research and Innovation website describes its explainers as follows: "this site lavs out the evidence and facts about the virus. the disease. the epidemic. and its control.5

Explainers prioritize public health knowledge by both laying out facts and encouraging the public to take steps to control the virus As Luzon (2022) observes, coronavirus explainers not only satisfy the general public's information needs in the health crisis, but engage them to become active agents to fight the virus. They thus incorporate informative and persuasive purposes.

Overall then, coronavirus explainers are useful tools to involve the public in its own healthcare. They offer an important opportunity to make scientific information more visible and engage laypeople in \*self-limiting behaviours to manage the impact of the virus" (McClaughlin et al., 2023, p. 2, p. 2).

# 3. Knowledge dissemination and communication during the pandemic

The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for more efective dissemination of health-knowledge and for the synthesis of health information (Verspoor, 2021). Knowledge of Covid, it symptoms and treatments, has been circulated through various news and academic platforms. Social media, because of their coverage and informal distribution among individuals and communities, are particularly efficient routes for rapid and effective dissemination (Chan et al., 2020). They also show the importance of egaging with target audiences. So, for example, Love et al. (2023) highlight the importance of personal pronouns and questions to foster communication and underline information in Covid-related social media posts by English local government organisations.

Academics have also been called on to asst the wider population to comprehend Covid information using social media, simul. taneously making science more accessible and participatory (Folltt & Strezov, 2015). With les formal gatekeeping and less daunt ingly obscure language, communication through these new venues permits greater flexibility than traditional academic genres (Tardy, 2016). Various studies have explored the ways academics make use of these various internet genres to engage the public (e.g., Luzon, 2022; McClaughlin et al., 2023; Tardy, 2023). Focusing on audience engagement in twets, for instance, Tardy (2023) examined the way epidemiologists use X (Twitter) to convey science and engage diverse audiences during the Covid pandemic.

Explainers, asrelatively recnt genre, have only started to be explored by academics (e.g., Spilioi, 2018; Schneiders, 2020; Luzon, 2022; Schorn, 2022; Schorn & Werner, 2023). In terms of information disemination, Spilioi's study (2018), for example, shows the way online news explainers asst lay people in understanding and contextualising the abundance of, ften fragmented, news updates. Hodam et al. (2021) found explainer videos were les efective than a combination of text and visuals as a learning tool. Looking more closely at the persuasive effcts of explainers, Schneiders (2020) explored the effectiveness of explainer videos in conveying information compared to established formats like text and audio. Also focusing on explainer videos in the context of science communication, Schorn (2022) identified the key persuasive features of explainer videos. Despite this research, however, there is an absence of work investigating how explainers generate audience engagement and their role in democratizing health knowledge.

In one of the few studies exploring how explainers communicate health-related knowledge, Luzon (2022) identified various semiotic devices, recontextualizing strategies, and strategies to engage the reader. The study found coronavirus explainers contain numerous persuasive and advisory features which seek to both inform lay people of the virus and offr them guidance to take appropriate actions. The study, however, loked at only a limited number of engagement features and did not consider variations of engagement practices in different types of explainers.

In our study, we compare a wider range of engagement features in two forms of explainers. Clearly, the popular explainers and academic explainers have diferent rhetorical purposes. One form of explainers, represented in a more impersonal way, have the major intention of explaining what is happening in the news story, and the other of popularising scientific knowledgeto a wider public. Both, however, speak from positions of relative credibility and with the opportunity to focus on the relevance for the audience and facilitate understanding of content. These different purposes are also reflected in different readerships, with the popular texts read by a more heterogeneous audience with a greater diverst of knowledge of the topic and perhaps les need for detail and the facts behind the science. The analysis of engagement practice in the two forms of explainers thus may be useful in informing writers of explaining and engaging practices in important arenas of public discourse.

# 4. Methods and procedures

# 4.1. The corpora

We compiled two corpora of explainers one from academic sources, Nature, Chemistry World' and UK Research and Innovation, and the other from three popular sites, the vox, FiveThiryEighto and The Guardian. All these websites include a considerable number of explainers where coronavirus is explained and our corpus comprised 162 texts in total.

The Nature website includes a "news explainer' section, offering texts in which expert knowledge is recontextualised for non specialists. The Chemistry World website, sponsored by the Royal Society of Chemistry, also contains popularising texts specifically labelled explainers. Both websites include explainers designed to help the wider public understand information related to the pandemic. imilarly, the UK Research and Inovation website has a specificsection Coronavirus: the science explained" which lays out the evidence and the facts about the virus, the disease, the epidemic, and its control.12 The popular explainer websites Vox.com and FiveThirtyEight com aim at advancing public knowledge by providing the context of, and explanations for, information on specialised topics, such as Covid 19. Vox.com puts it like this:

"We live in a world of too much information and too ittle context. Too much noise and too littl insight. That's where Vox's explainers come in. 13

The Mainstream news website, The Guardian, also has an Explainer" section, covering a wide range of topics of particular interest for the general public.

We compiled our corpus of academic explainers by selecting all 81 written explainer texts focusing explicitly on Covid-19, from the websites of Nature, Chemisry World magazine and UK Research and Inovation. We also built a popular explainer corpus of 81 new. explainer texts from websites of Vox, FiveThirtyght and The Guardian for purposes of comparison. Our criteria in both cases were tha the explainers.

1) were published between January 2020 and August 2023;   
2) were written in English;   
3) discussed or reported Covid-19 public health issues rather than political aspects of the pandemic.

Following these criteria, news explainers were randomly selected using a modified form of stratified random sampling in order to achieve a balanced corpus with the academic explainers (Table 1). We did not attempt to select an equal number of texts from each journal as the sources had diferent preference for covid topics with some taking a greater interest than others,but we achieved a balance of texts with the same number of explainers from The Guardian as from Nature, from FiveThirtyEight as from Chemistry World and from V0X as from UK Research and Inovation. The corpora thus comprised 162 texts of 187,185 words. (Table 2).

# 4.2. Analytical framework: engagement

To determine how explainer authors seek to engage their readers, we drew on Hyland's (2005) engagement model as an analytical framework. This has ben widely used to explore a range of genres as diverse as research artice (e.g., McGrath & Kuteeva, 2012), student written discourse (Lee & Deakin, 2016) and dissertation defences (Recski 2005), academic blogs (Zou & Hyland, 2020) and Twitter tweets (Luzon, 2023). The model suggests that engagement is an aligment dimension where writers seek to involve readers in the text as discourse participant, pll them along with their aguments, and guide them to interpretations (Hyland, 2005). The model comprises five broad functional categories.

: Reader mention brings readers into a discourse, normally through second person pronouns   
: Directives instruct the reader, mainly expressed through imperatives and obligation modals.   
Questions invit direct collsion by addressing the reader as having an interest in an ssue and a willingness o follow the writer's response.   
: Shared knowledge markers to ask readers to recognise something as familiar or accepted.   
. Personal asides comment on what has been said, adding to the writer-reader relationship.

Together these features reveal something of how writers directly addres readers to asst comprehension, build interpersonal solidarity and finesse agreement.

# 4.3. Coding and analysis

The two explainer corpora were searched for engagement features using AntConc (Anthony, 2022). We used the list of common engagement features reported in previous studies (e.g, Hyland, 2002a; Hyland, 2005), with additional items added by the authors after a close manual reading of the corpora. These items are mainly medical-specific directives, relating to taking covid tests or the vaccine. Allretrieved items were concordanced and manuall checked to ensure that they performed an engagement function. A $3 0 \%$ sample was then independently coded by each author, with an inter-rater agreement of $9 5 \%$ . Each author then conducted an intra-reliability test by re-categorizing $2 5 \%$ of the cases two weeks after the initial coding with full agreement between the two categorizations. Finally, the frequencies of each feature were calculated afer normalizing the results to 1000 words to allow for cross-corpora comparison. The statistical significance of the results was determined by using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney $U$ test. The results are discussed in the following sections.

# 5. Engagement: results and discussion

Overall, we identified 1226 engagement devices in the academic explainer corpus (14.02 items per 1000 words) and 2146 in the   
popular explainer corpus (21.51 per 100. The details are presented in Table 3. Authors of both types f explainers are clearly aware   
that they need to engage with audiences, but there are significantly more features in the popular explainers $\mathrm { T } = 4 5 7 3 . 5$ , z-statistic $=$   
4.3295, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 . } \end{array}$ , with reader mention being particularly favoured with nearly three times as many as in the academic explainers. Table 3 shows that reader-mention, directives and personal asides are more frequent in popular explainers $\mathrm { ~ U } = 5 3 4 3$ $\mathbf { z }$ statistic $=$

6.9158, $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ for reader mention, $\mathrm { U } = 3 5 1 8 . 5$ $\mathbf { z }$ statistic $= 0 . 7 9 7$ $\mathtt { p } = 0 . 4 2 5 4$ for directives and $\mathrm { U } = 4 2 4 9$ $\mathbf { z }$ statistic $= 3 . 4 6 6 4$ p $< 0 . 0 0 1$ for personal asides). In contrast, questions and appeals to shared knowledge are significantly more frequent in academic explainers $\mathrm { ( U } = 3 9 3 6 . 5$ $\mathbf { z }$ statistic $= 2 . 1 9 7 0$ ${ \tt p } = 0 . 0 2 8$ for questions and $\mathrm { U } = 4 5 7 4 . 5$ $\mathbf { z }$ statistic $= 4 . 3 6 1 1$ $\mathbb { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ for shared knowledge). These variations show that popular explainers tend to be more collquial and carry a more informal tone than academic explainers. By coating the subtleties of a news topic with a journalistic flaour and greater fluidity, they are closer to a conversational tone which treats the audience as a listener more than a reader (Vankin, 2021). They thus encourage a relatively more informal and engaging communication.

Academic explainers, in contrast, aim mainly at the dissemination of health-related knowledge, rather than sketching a general background context, although they can stillbe viewed as a hybrid genre, situated between academic and journalistic writing. The distribution of engagement forms, however, presents a les straightforward picture. Whil there are significantly more questions and appeals to sharedness there are fewer reader-mentions, directives and personal asides. These three fatures, of course, ae also relatively rare in journal artices (Hyland & Jiang, 2016; McGrath & Kuteeva, 2012; Zou & Hyland, 2019). Questions and appeals to shared knowledge are also infrequent in articles, but more common in the academic explainers as writers try to acknowledge the presence of readers without directly referring to them. We elaborate on each feature in what follows.

# 5.1. Reader mention

Reader pronouns offer the most explicit ways of bringing the audience into a discourse by

Directly eferring to them (Hyland, 2008). They account for the largest proportion of engagement markers in each explainer corpus, as the direct reference to the readers helps create the proximity of a real and pressing health issue and involve the audience in the discussion. They would seem to be a natural i in a genre designed to present thorough and acesble explanations which guide audiences through personal uncertainties.

(1) Can you get too many boosters? (AE 3) 14   
(2) To stop mutations, quite simply, we need to stop the spread of SARs-Cov-2 in general. For one, that helps us deal with the pandemic overall. (PE 55)

Table 3 shows that reader mention was almost three times more frequent in popular explainers than in academic ones $[ \mathrm { U } = 5 3 4 3$ , Zstatistic $= 6 . 9 1 5 8 $ $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 ) } \end{array}$ , indicating the higher level of interactivity of the journalistic texts. The use of reader mention in these explainers in popular news outlets helps contribute to their immediacy and easy comprehensibilit as writers weave in elements of narrative and anecdote to their texts. Authors are attempting to make a connection with their audiences, rather as in popular journalism (Ricketson, 1997) and references to the reader assist this sense of intimacy and shared personal experience.

(3) So if you caught flu or another respiratory virus over Christmas, your immune defences might resist a brief encounter with Covid. (PE 2)   
(4) Testing several times as your llnes progreses may be the only way to rule out Covid - and even then you may never know for sure. But although Covid may be the first thing we think of when we fl seriously unwell it is by no means the only bug capitalising on the heady pre-Christmas cocktail of social events. (PE 3)

The relative paucity of reader pronouns in academic explainers in contrast, reflects their relative absence in scientific articles Explicit reference to the reader is uncommon in many fields, such as medicine, which does not sanction the same degree of authorial presence as articles in the softer sciences (Hyland, 2005). Interestingly, reader mentions are ofen found in combination with other engagement feature, particularly questions, in the academic texts to invite the involvement of readers, acknowledge their expectations of inclusion, or stimulate their interest in health knowledge.

(5) What do we know about the Omicron-specific versions of the COvID vaccine? (AE 3) (6) How do we know if a vaccine is likely to work? (AE 25)

Table 4 shows that al forms of reader pronouns are more frequent in popular explainers, even though the difference is not sig nificant for indefinite pronouns $\mathrm { { T } } = 4 9 6 0$ $\mathbf { Z }$ statistic $= 5 . 6 4 2 2$ $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ for we/our/us, $\mathrm { U } = 5 2 0 7 $ $\mathbf { z }$ statistic $= 6 . 7 0 4 2$ $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ for you/your and $\mathrm { U } = 3 4 7 8$ $\mathbf { Z }$ statistic $= 0 . 8 9 7 5$ $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 3 6 9 5$ for one/reader).

Indefinite pronouns are generally seen as representing the 'faceless authorial positioning of formally conventional academic discourse, and so i surprising to se slightly more cases in the popular explainers, although they accounted for a higher percentage in academic explainers $( 5 . 2 7 \%$ and $2 . 2 5 \%$ . The use of a strategy commonly used to reduce the writer's personal involvement in an argument via les explicitly direct way of engaging an audience suggests that popular explainers are perhaps more formal than other journalistc genres. Altenatively, its use may also be asciated with ths particular issue. It does, however, point to the different strategies adopted by researchers when transforming their research from their journal articles to academic explainers. Less personally intrusive and direct than the second person, the more extensive use of inclusive we helps generate affinty and solidarity les overtly, generally by evoking readers' knowledge (7) or by encouraging collaborative efforts to wrestle with the health crisis (8).

(7) We know that vaccines prevent covi-19 in adults because the clinical trials were designed to show this. (AE 13) (8) We have some efective vaccines that willbe dstributed in a few weeks - we need to hold on tight, make one extra sacrifice and then, next Christmas, we can go back to normal. (AE 21)

Examining the uses of reader mention in different types of clauses shows further variations between two forms of explainers. As shown in Table 5, the geat majority of clauses contaning reader pronouns overall are declaratives. The highest frequencies of nearly all clause types containing reader mention forms are in popular explainers, with only imperatives an exception.

The prevailing use of reader mention in declarative clauses $[ \mathrm { U } = 5 3 6 9$ $\mathbf { Z }$ statistic $= 7 . 0 0 8 7$ $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 . } \end{array}$ , in particular, normally occur with various stance markers which explicitl state the author's position and preferred reading. Stance features such as first person sef-mention and atitude markers are common,reflecting the popular reach of social media texts to a wide, heterogeneous audience.

(9) I think it is inevitable that we will see new variants with varying degrees of immune evasion, ...(AE 6) (10) \*My recommendation is that you get each vaccine in a separate arm, so if you do get a sore arm you know which vaccine has caused that particular side-effect," .... (PE 16)

The significantly more frequent use of reader mention in conditionals in popular explainers $\mathrm { U } = 4 7 5 1 . 5$ $\mathbf { Z }$ statistic $= 5 . 6 3 2 5$ $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { p } } <$ 0.001) perhaps indicates a journalistic preference to select specific groups to gain attention and create a sense of involvement (Love et al., 2023). Combined with questions in particula, reader mention is a powerful way to engage audiences and encourage readers to reflect on their own experiences as a basis for remedial action.

(11) But if you are consistently testing negative for Covid on a lateral flow test, what else could it be? (PE 3) (12) But on the individual level, if you get an antibody test back and it's positive, what should you do? (PE 65)

Finally, it is interesting to note that imperative clauses contain more reader pronouns in academic explainers $\mathbf { \Delta } \mathbf { U } = 3 8 5 3$ , z-statistic $= 2 . 6 6 1 7$ $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 8 \mathrm { , } } \end{array}$ . This is a scholarly source and the facts offered by researchers carry an additional weight of veracity, being thoroughly researched to meet the public's need to aes pecialised knowledge about Covid (Luzon, 2022). The use of reader pronouns can therefore be an important means of both raising awareness and assigning readers responsibilities to cope with th virus.

(13) Let's start with the basics. What is a vaccine? (AE 70)   
(14) You should wear a mask around other people and get tested four to six days after the exposure and anytime you develop symptoms. (AE 71)

# 5.2. Directives

Directives instruct readers to perform actions or to view things in a way determined by the writer, to help manage the audience's understanding and processing of a text (Hyland, 2002a). They are generally expressed through obligation modal (e.g., must, should), imperatives (e.g., note, consider) and predicative adjectives expressing the writer's judgements f necessity/importance. In Covid explainers, directives are linguistic instruments for encouraging behavioural change, soliciting the public to take personal responsibility for coping with the disease.

(15) .. so to reduce the reproduction number enough tostop the epidemic growing, we must limit contacts between healthy and infectious people. (AE 47)   
(16) We should only be ramping up our response dramaticall, including closing borders, f there is a real variant of concern, meaning it's causing more severe disease or deaths and evading the immune response. (PE 14)

In journal articles directives are the most frequent devices used to initiate reader participation (Hyland & Jiang, 2016), but Table 3 shows they are slightly more frequent in popular than academic explainers $\mathrm { ( U } = 3 5 1 8 . 5 $ $\mathbf { Z }$ statistic $= 0 . 7 9 7$ $\mathfrak { p } = 0 . 4 2 5 4 \AA )$ , even though they occupy a higher percentage in academic explainers $( 1 9 . 9 0 \% )$ . This result corresponds with Lee's (2011) finding that directives are more frequent in both English and Japanese editorials than in research articles. But directives are a somewhat hazardous strategy as while they seek to engage readers, they do this in a direct and unvarnished way, instructing the audience to see things in a way determined by the writer. This risks undermining the afiliative tenor academic explainers seek to evoke.

It is, however, a means of speaking directly to readers and seeking to involve them in the argument and is therefore adopted by academics to align with the wider audience which explainers atract. Here academics are using directives to recontextualize expert information about the virus in a way which might resonate with the audience. In popular explainers, directives act more as a\*pressing anguage (Luzon, 2022, p. 110), to emphasize the seriousnes of the situation or renforce the peruasivenes of suggestions. They also help convey the journalist's emotion and simultaneously evoke similar emotions in readers (Hopper & Huxford, 2017). This is a key element of a successful news story, especially when combined with receiver pronouns.

(17) Now you have to remember, vaccines are incredibly effctive at preventing severe disease and death, but hey dont prevent ll infections and they don't prevent all onward transmission. (PE 23)   
(18) Add to that waning immunity and a more transmissible version of the virus, and you have an increasing number of people becoming vulnerable again. (PE 30)

19) \*We must stay vigilant in our fight against CovID-19 and continue t expand Americans' accessto the best vaccines and treatments," wrote Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra in a statement. (PE 31)

Directives appear to perform diffrent functions in the two forms of explainers. Hyland (2002a) suggests that there are three types of irecti: textal, which guide redrs to anthr part of the tt r to anthr ext (., e mh 199 rfer Table 1); phsical, which instruct them how to carry out some action in the real world (e.g., open the valve, heat the mixture); and cognitive, which lead them through a line of rasoning to certain conclusions (e.g, note, consider). Table 6 shows that textual and cognitive acts were more frequent in academic explainers, even though the difference in cognitive acts was not significant $\mathrm { { T } } = 3 7 2 6$ $\mathbf { z }$ statistic $= 3 . 4 1 8 0$ $\boldsymbol { \mathrm { p } } <$ 0.001 for textual acts and $\mathrm { U } = 3 3 1 8$ , z-statistic $= 0 . 1 5 0 5$ $\mathtt { p } = 0 . 8 8 0 4$ for cognitive acts). Physical acts, in contrast, were slightly higher in the popular explainers $\mathrm { T } \mathrm { U } = 3 7 2 3 . 5$ $\mathbf { z }$ statistic $= 1 . 4 9 1 2$ 3 $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 1 3 5 9 )$

Textual directives are found exclusively in academic explainers, a hangover from more formal types of academic argument and pointing to the hybrid nature of academic explainers. As in research articles, where authors support their arguments by graphical means or intratextual rferences (Hyland, 2015), textual directives in the academic variety of explainer were mainly used to refer to extra-textual materials (20), to other part of the same text (21) or to tables or figures (22. Attempts to develop public health understandings of a general audience thus carries traces of the original research presentations.

(20) Making mRNA vaccines has a simplicity about it, but scaling up istricky, says Zoltan Kis, a chemical engineer at the Future Vaccine Manufacturing Hub at Imperial College London (see 'Messenger RNA: the science of speed'). (AE 16)   
(21) It is ifficult to differentiate what damage is due to the virus itelf, the intial immune response to the virus, blood clots in the lung or a later severe inflammation (see below). (AE 31)   
(22) Coronaviruses are divided into four groups see Table) and it might be significant that the majority of veterinary vaccines have been developed for alphacoronaviruses. (AE 53)

Cognitive directives, mentioned above as the most potentially threatening type, were also more frequent in academic explainers (U $= 3 3 1 8$ $\mathbf { z }$ statistic $= 0 . 1 5 0 5$ $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 8 8 0 4 )$ . They carry the greatest degree of imposition on others, requiring readers to reflect on, and hopefull concede, some aspect of an argument (Hyland, 2002a). This result i also consistent with Hyland's (2008) finding that cognitive directives are overwhelmingly found in natural science articles. This again points to the hybrid nature of academic explainers where writers draw on their experience of academic argument to explicitly lead readers through an argument to their claims. In these pandemic explainers the use of cognitive acts also helps addressthe concerns of lay readers and gaps in their health knowledge.

(23) Also, remember that the EPA list only covers products already registered with the agency as pesticides. (AE 68) (24) Remember: antigen test results can change quickly, and a negative result i really only trustworthy for eight to 12 h (AE 71)

This kind of explicit guidance of the public's perceptions and their engagement with public health measures is key for developing effective interventions in times of crisis (Parrott, 1995).

Physical directives, the final type, atempt to stimulate some real-world actions by the audience, and in the popular explainers they are an effective way for writers to creat immediacy and capture the audience'sattention. The coronavirus seems to have encouraged journalists to establish a more direct and effective conversation to address the public's concerns (Tunez-Lopez et al., 2020).

(25) Even after you get your two jabs, you should wear a mask and avoid crowds and situations where you could spread the virus to a lot of other people. (PE 75)   
(26) Do what you can to take care of your mental health (PE 37)   
(27) Don't take a test that looks for antibodies - proteins that help the immune system contain infections - because antibodies take a while to show up after an infection starts, and they can linger long after the virus is cleared. (PE 48)

Physical directives thus help incorporate the audience into the processof creating content, presenting the author's suggestions to imply a bottom-up communication. To sum up, in popular explainers, writers emphasize the stimulation of real-world actions, to create immediacy and arouse the wider audience's interests in joining the discussions. In academic explainers, in contrast, textual and cognitive acts are preferred to either guide the lay audience in understanding health knowledge or draw on the specialist audiences' experience of academic argument to take part in the health communication.

# 5.3.  Questions

As the main strategy of dialogic engagement, questions invite readers into the discourse as participants and lead them to agreement (Hyland, 2002b). They account for the second largest engagement feature in academic explainers $( 2 8 . 3 0 \% )$ and the third in popular explainers $( 1 3 . 1 9 \% )$ . Their importance lies in allowing writers to move away from a monologue and turn a one-sided exposition into a dialogue. This helps explain their preponderance in journalistic texts, including the explainers, where they help create a kind of conversational informality which involves the audience.

(28) And are we relly more vulnerable to getting sick this winter, or have we just forgotten what life was like before Covid re strictions stopped the usual merry-go-round of seasonal infections? (PE 3)

In titles they are helpful in attracting readers and improving the click-through ratio.

# (29) Will we see a new Omicron strain this autumn? (AE 2)

Table 3 shows that questions were significantly more frequent in academic explainers $\mathrm { ( U } = 3 9 3 6 . 5$ , z-statistic $= 2 . 1 9 7 0$ A $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 2 8$ indicating their appeal to writer seeking to present their academic work to new audiences. The Q and A format i a familiar one to nonacademic audiences of academic explainers which helps to engage them in the arguments and challenges them to reflect on the health knowledge conveyed. It is a sequence which plays an important part in structuring explainer texts. Questions help manufacture immediacy and make the specialised knowledge more interesting, available and easier to digest. While they express an imbalance of specialised knowledge between participants (Hyland, 2002b), there is n assumption in explainers that the reader has come to the text to learn and so this disparity is acceptable.

In addition, questions also help hook the interest of readers and prepare them for the topic by appearing in titles.

# (30) What are the risk factors for long COvID?

A meta-analysis (link to article) published in March identified a host of risk factors for developing the condition: being female, of older age, having a high body mass index and smoking. (AE 1).

(31) Why call it BA.2.12.1? A guide to the tangled Omicron family (AE 5)

Table 7 shows that titles in both forms of Covid explainer were formulated as questions, comprising over half of all titles in the academic type.

Popular explainers are also structured as aseries of questions and answers, with each response flowing logicall into the next. These interrogative gambits (Webber, 1994, p. 264), serve as a reader-friendly strategy and help address the audiences concerns. By framing the question as a shared concern with the public, these titles can be a powerful draw.

(32) Has the virus reached the UK? (PE 2) (33) What is the situation in the UK? (PE 5) (34) Can I get another Covid jab? (PE 6)

The interrogative form thus encourages the audience to take part in the discussion. By explicitly elciting responses, writers can promote \*not just polylogues or multi-part conversations, but interwoven polylogues" Bondi (2018, p. 4). Audience are led to reflect on their personal experiences and perceptions of Covid and, when combined with reader pronouns, questions help create a context of communication between like-minded, reasonable people who share a common anxiety.

(35) New variants - and new "variants of concern' - are going to keep emerging. And when they do, what should you do? (PE 68) (36) \*There iscurrentl no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection." Ugh, right? (PE 65)

# 5.4. Shared knowledge

Appeals to shared knowledge are ofen used in professonal research writing to position readers within the apparently naturalized boundaries of isciplinary understandings (Hyland, 2001). Directly claiming sharednessis a way of constructing readers as members of the same communit, fattering their knowledge of the topic and moving them towards agreement. In explainers, appeals to shared knowledge are used to introduce shared background knowledge of the virus or foreground a common frame for responding to the health crisis. The construction of solidarity involves both direct appeals to readers to recognise a common understanding of the virus and to promote their participation in the discussion by implying a certain level of understanding.

(37) Normally, vaccines go into human trials after tests for safety and effectiveness in animals. (AE 25) (38) It is also known that being infected with Covid-19 boosts your protection from reinfection. (PE 23)

As Table 3 shows, appeals to shared knowledge were significantly more frequent in academic explainers $( \mathrm { U } = 4 5 7 4 . 5 $ , z-statistic $=$ 4.3611, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 } \end{array}$ ), once again imparting an academic flavour to a popular genre. These explainers, of course, are not only designed to be informative but also aim to persuade readers of the veracity of the explanation. A common strategy used by academics to achieve credibility and provide evidence for the reliability of information is by referring to shared authoritative sources. Appealing to a reader's assumed familiarity with the background of a topic and wider everyday understandings helps to recruit them as a cooperative participant (Zou & Hyland, 2021). This is not a strategy we find in the popular explainers, however, perhaps because the readership is less certainly identified and more diverse, and therefore less reliably possessing shared specialised background.

Table 7 Raw number of question and non-question titles in two forms of explainers.   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Academic explainers (AE)</td><td> Popular explainers (PE)</td></tr><tr><td>Question titles</td><td>51</td><td>38</td></tr><tr><td> Non-question titles</td><td>30</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>81</td><td>81</td></tr></table></body></html>

(39) Levels of these molecules typically shoot up after vaccination, then quickly taper off months later. (AE 10) (40) Ninety-six per cent of the participants had some olfactory dysfunction, and $1 8 \%$ had total smell loss (otherwise known as anosmia). (AE 20)

By referring to specialised information as ifi were shared knowledge, the author foregrounds a common frame for seeing the virus and persuade the audience by involving them in the discussion of familiar health terms.

We can categorise the appeals to shared knowledge in explainers into three types of appeals (Hyland & Jiang, 2016). Authors can refer to logical reasoning, which concerns the coherence of the argument (e.g., obviousl, of course); they can rais routine conditions, concerned with usual circumstances or behaviours in the real world (e.g., normall, regularly); and they can call up familiarity with tradition, concerned with usual communty practice nd beliefs g., common traditionally. able hows the variations of dfferent types in two forms of explainers.

As noted, these appeals to shared knowledge are significantly more common in the academic explainers $\mathrm { ~ U } = 4 2 4 2$ $\mathbf { z }$ statistic $=$ 3.3041, $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ for tradition & typicality, $\mathrm { U } = 3 4 7 1$ , z-statistic $= 1 . 1 6 6 5$ $\mathtt { p } = 0 . 2 4 3 4$ for logical reasoning and $\mathrm { U } = 3 9 0 7$ , z-statistic $= 2 . 4 8 5 3$ ${ \bf p } = 0 . 0 1 2 9$ for routine conditions). The tradition and typicality type of markers predominate in both forms of explainers, while they accounted for a higher percentage in popular explainers $( 7 0 . 0 8 \% )$ . The journalists predominately used them to confirm shared knowledge with the audience (41) while for the academics they functioned as reminders to show readers that this is something they should know - that the knowledge has been previously shared (example 42). This is in line with the major function of academic explainers in which laying out the evidence and disseminating facts about the virus is of vital importance.

(41) Coronaviruses infect a wide variety of mammals and birds and are commonly associated with intestinal (enteritis) and respi ratory illnesses. (PE 53)   
(42) Once someone has recovered from a viral infection, the cell of the immune system 'remember' the virus, and this results in resistance to a second infection by the same virus, known as immunity. (AE 58)

Reference to logical reasoning as a shared resource is perhaps the most explicitly manipulative type of appeal, and this perhaps accounts for their lack of popularity among explainer writers. This finding also reflects the use of shared knowledge functions in science journal articles Hyland & Jiang, 2016). In explainers, the author nees to make connections explicit to an uncertan redership without unnecessary displays of superior knowledge. Appeals to reasoning are therefore used sparingly and almost always to refer to matters with which readers are likely to agree.

(43) Of course, the precise number of those who are now immune varies considerably from one nation to the next. (AE 73) (44) Being unable to appreciate the flavour of food i obviously a major loss but other sensations are important, to. (AE 20)

Popular explainers thus generally refer to typicality (45 and 46) and routine conditions (47 and 48) to encourage a broad audience to think about their relationship with Covid isues and consider their experiences of coping with the pandemic. The later, incidentall, are often found in quotations as authors invoke alternative sources to engage the public as informed participants familiar with the symptoms or understanding of the virus.

(45) It's most commonly associated with bleeding and hemorrhaging, but the virus can also cause gastrointestinal issues like vomiting. (PE 81)   
(46) It is also known that being infected with Covid-19 boosts your protection from reinfection. (PE23)   
(47) Normally, this time of year, we'd be running 20 to 30 percent positive," said Lynnette Brammer, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Domestic Influenza Surveillance team. (PE 74)   
(48) \*This is a common occrrence in infectious diseases where there is some immune protection . that comes with age - that you had time to encounter a range of different diseases and develop immunity." (PE16)

Table 8 Types of appeals to shared knowledge in explainers (per 1o00 words and $\%$   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Academic explainers (AE)</td><td colspan="2">Popular explainers (PE)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td> per 1000 words</td><td>%</td><td> per 1000 words</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>Tradition/typicality</td><td>1.44</td><td>64.95</td><td>0.89</td><td>70.08</td></tr><tr><td>Logical reasoning</td><td>0.18</td><td>8.25</td><td>0.09</td><td>7.09</td></tr><tr><td>Routine conditions</td><td>0.60</td><td>26.80</td><td>0.29</td><td>22.83</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>2.22</td><td>100.00</td><td>1.27</td><td>100.00</td></tr></table></body></html>

To sum up, the fact that all types of appeals to shared knowledge are more frequent in academic explainers shows again that this is something of a hybrid genre which continue to incorporate academic practices to suit the expectations of a specialist audience while taking the trouble to elaborate for more general readers.

# 5.5. Personal asides

Personal aside are brief interruptions t the argument which allow writers to address the audience directl by offering a personal comment on what has been said (Hyland, 2005). As an abrupt detour to reach the audience directly, they imply friendly informality and intimacy with the audience while conveying the asurednessto make a personal remark. In news explainers, they sere to directly develop the ongoing text, pausing the discussion to hook the audience's interes or align with them to seek appropriate response.

(49) In Portugal - where coviD-19 vaccination and boosting rates are very high -the levels of death and hospitalization associated with the latest wave are similar to those in the first Omicron wave (although stil nothing like the impact caused by earlier variants). (AE 4)   
(50) Human challenge trials, which directly expose healthy people to the virus, could help test for immunity more quickly (though some people in the field are skeptical, because setting up these trials could take longer than more traditional studies). (PE 63)

Personal aides are the least used engagement feature in the explainers but were ignificantly more frequent in the popular variety $( \mathrm { U } = 4 2 4 9$ $\mathbf { Z }$ statistic $= 3 . 4 6 6 4$ $\mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1$ for personal asides) (see Table 3). Personal asides are one of the most explicit ways authors can open a space to present their standpoint, interrupting themselves in mid-flow to

initiate a direct conversation with readers. The use of these forms in popular explainers may reflect the more explicitly interactive nature of journalism in which writers actively seek to atract audience participation and involvement (Steensen, 2013). Guardian journalists seem particularly drawn to them as a way of both sharing a news story and encouraging reader self-reflection.

(51) Pfizer/BioNTech performs the next best, while Johnson & Johnson was the weakest of the thre in its original one-dose regimen (though it has not seen much waning over time). (PE 51)   
(52) Animal studies may also provide some answers, acording to Rasmussen. (She told me ferres are particularly useful because they have a similar respiratory system to humans.) (PE 81)

Similarly small frequencies are found in other academic genres such as journal articles or academic blogs (Hyland, 2001; Zou & Hyland, 2021). Academics seem les willing to impose on the reader with a meta-comment, perhaps because of strict word limit or a sense that it interrupts the progressof the argument. When asides do occur in explainers they evoke a shared frame for understanding or a personal intervention recommending protective measures.

(53) In contrast, upper respiratory symptoms such as a runny nose or sore throat occur in $3 0 { - } 4 0 \%$ and diarrhoea and/or vomiting are found in around $1 0 \%$ (sometimes this is the only symptom), more often than in adults. (AE 42)   
(54) If you're taking an at-home COviD-19 test, consider any positive result to mean you have COviD-19. You don't need toconfirm with a PCR test. (Even if it's an extremely faint line, you should consider yourself infected and isolate.) (AE 71)

Combined with attitude makers, personal asides also reveal the author's evaluations or feeling in these explainers, to offer a clear rationale for the public adhering to certain measures and take personal responsibility for their health.

# 6. Conclusions

We have examined two forms of the relatively new genre of explainer' to understand how writers engage heterogeneous lay audiences to communicate intricate, even specialised, knowledge of the Covid pandemic. To do this, writers of both academic and popular explainers have to find ways of holding the attention of a diverse audience and informing them of often complex public health issues. For academics, Covid-19 relevant research needs to be recontextualised for non-specialists in ways which involve making changes to the rhetorical features they are familiar with when ineracting with a specialist audience. For journalists perhaps more familiar with popular news genres, the task of engaging readers may be easier and require fewer adjustments to their everyday work.

Our analyses indicate both forms of explainers make considerable use of engagement resources. In popular explainers, writers used more resources overall and especilly those feaures which ought to mention the audience explicitly, which directed them to think in certain ways and which addressed the audience directl by ffring more parenthetcal comment. Academic explainers, on the other hand, emphasied shared knowledge more frequently and addressed the audience with questions. These variations can be explained by the different communication agendas and experiences of the writers and their asesments of how health topic can best e conveyed to different audiences. Popular explainers are largely written by news people and reflect something of ajournalistic tone, presenting arguments in a more informal, direct and somewhat more urgent style. Academic explainers, in contrast sit between academic and journalistic writing seeking to convey scientifi information to both membersof the discipline and the interested lay public. We also believe that authors of popular explainers tend to present themselves in a role which tends towards directing the general public's behaviours with regard to the vaccine, while those writing academic explainers seem more interested in providing evidence for policies in these texts.

Our study is not without limitations, of course, and it would be profitable to confirm some of our conjectural explanations with interviews of writers concerning their rhetorical choices and of readers to determine their success. We are also aware that we may not have identified all engagement features, particularly in news explainers. The engagement framework was initially developed from written academic texts and future work might sek to extend this model both to popular explainers and to see how multimodal elements of the explainer genres might be incorporated to provide a fuller picture of how semiotic resources are orchestrated in digital genres (Luzon, 2023). Furthermore, our study focuses on news explainers dealing exclusively with the Covid issue and it would be interesting to explore if strategies vary when covering other topics.

We hope, however, that our work has shed some light on the engagement patterns used in this srecently emergent genre, and how interpersonal resources are differently employed to mee different exigencies in discussing health issues. We also hope to have extended the literature on metadiscourse by exploring its relevance and disributional patterns in the popular discussion of public health. In this sense, the results contribute to revealing the rhetorical changes brought about by new popular genres when discussing a major healthissue. More imortantly, it seks to undertand something of how helth-related knowledg i rcontxtualise in popular genres and of the important role played in this process by both journalists and academics. Practically, the present study may assit writers and students of health discourses to recognise the language choices writers consistently make in this genre and to better understand why they make them. Our study may also be of interest to teachers of English for Academic Purposes and of mass communication when developing materials for writers seeking to reach new audiences or participate in this exciting genre.
