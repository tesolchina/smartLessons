This study uses a novel approach to describe modern English academic texts in terms of the amount and distribution of syntactic subordination, coordination and phrasal structures. Inconsistent results have been reported in previous scholarship regarding the trajectory of syntactic complexification based on English language backgrounds and linguistic proficiency of writers. For the first time, a combination of two predictive statistical modelling methods of mixed-effects modelling and supervised machine learning modelling with random forest is used to examine the extent to which the type, amount, and distribution of these syntactic structures can be attributed to a text-intrinsic feature (subgenres or rhetorical sections of academic register) and a text-extrinsic factor (English language background based on academic context) in a corpus of master’s dissertations. To revisit the theories of English L1 vs. L2 texts, strong predictors of syntactic complexity across academic writings of EFL, ESL, and English L1 postgraduate students were identified. The findings show that EFL texts are dominantly subordinate in nature, English L1’s dominantly phrasal, and the ESL dissertations exhibited similar amounts of subordination and phrasal structures. Distinct syntactic structures also characterise rhetorical sections: abstracts are predominantly phrasal, literature reviews distinctly subordinate, and conclusion sections have noticeable amounts of verb phrases.

# 1. Introduction

Syntactic complexity, which in Ortega (2003) is equated with linguistic complexity and syntactic maturity, in Lu (2014, p.130) is defined as “the range and degree of sophistication of syntactic structures”. A growing number of global and fine-grained syntactic complexity measures have been proposed as objective and quantifiable indices for gauging L1 (first language) and L2 (second language) proficiency and development (e.g., Bulte & Housen, 2014; Norris & Ortega, 2009) and as descriptors of various genres, registers, and rhetorical sections (e.g., Biber & Gray, 2013; Lu, Casal, & Liu, 2020). Particular attention has been paid to global syntactic structures and measures of subordination, coordination, and phrasal complexity with a wide range of applications and implications in first and second language acquisition and development, English L1 vs. L2 performance and proficiency (differences), automatic linguistic analysers, text simplification and classification, and in writing research, e.g., syntactic features of various genres of writing (e.g., Biber & Gray, 2013; Lu, 2011, 2014; Sheehan, Kostin, Futagi, & Flor, 2010; Wolfe-Quintero, Inagaki, & Kim, 1998).

Since there is no upper or lower bound for the values of syntactic complexity measures, it is more plausible to think of syntactic complexity as a continuum stretching from very low complexity (e.g., short texts produced by children or beginner English L2 learners) to very high complexity (e.g., very abstract and embedded philosophical and formal texts). Research findings indicate that academic writing tends to fall towards the more complex part of the spectrum where high syntactic complexity values seem to denote higher linguistic proficiency, later stages of syntactic and grammatical development, and higher writing quality (see for example Ai & Lu, 2013; Lu, 2011; Ortega, 2003; Wolfe-Quintero et al., 1998), partly because addressing complex academic concepts and ideas requires more complex structures.

Linguistic characterisation of modern academic writing especially in corpus-based, genre-specific, and discipline-specific studies, is considered as a noticeable caveat in writing research and as a fundamental requirement for syllabus design, materials development, and teaching practices and assessment especially in EFL and ESL academic contexts (Biber, 2006; Flowerdew, 2017; Hinkel, 2004; Lu, 2017; Lu et al., 2020; Nesi & Gardner, 2012). Hinkel (2004, p. 52), for instance, argues that large-scale corpus studies are required to identify the most frequent lexical and syntactic patterns in various academic writing genres to help researchers “explain how written academic prose is constructed” and to “inform writing instruction and pedagogy”. She demonstrates the discrepancy between what is taught in English for academic purposes programmes and the disciplinary academic writing norms expected of students.

It is against the backdrop of these studies and recommendations that this study takes place. In the following sections, I first introduce the most-frequently-used global syntactic indices and report the findings regarding their effectiveness in capturing English L1 and L2 development and proficiency (differences). I then situate this research at the crossroads of genre-specific, discipline-specific, and linguistic complexity and proficiency studies. I will finally take advantage of several robust statistical modelling and NLP (Natural Language Processing) methods to examine the extent to which the variations among the syntactic structures of subordination, coordination, and phrasal complexity can be attributed to two main text-intrinsic and textextrinsic characteristics in a specialised academic writing corpus.

# 2. Subordination, coordination, and phrasal complexity in SLA, corpus, and writing research

Syntactic complexity as a multidimensional construct in research on linguistic proficiency and development is frequently investigated in the first and second language as well as in writing and academic studies. I will review nine important and mostfrequently-used global syntactic measures and examine their effectiveness in capturing the differences in texts produced by English L1 vs. L2 as well as texts written by linguistically proficient vs. lower-level proficiency ones as supported by the following studies.

The number of (independent) clauses, dependent/subordinate clauses, and complex T-units is frequently used to quantify syntactic subordination. A clause (e.g., independent clauses, nominal, adjective and adverb clauses) is defined as a structure comprising a subject and a finite verb (Lu, 2010, 2014) and a dependent clause is specified as a finite nominal, adjective, or adverb clause (Cooper, 1976; Lu, 2010, 2014). A complex T-unit includes at least one dependent clause of any type (e.g., relative, noun, and adverbial) but does not differentiate between the types and number of dependent clauses, and therefore, is regarded as a global syntactic structure.

One of the most-studied subordination indices is the T-unit complexity ratio $( \mathbf { C } / \mathrm { T } )$ which measures the number of clauses per T-unit and includes all types of clauses. It is reported in six studies reviewed by Wolfe-Quintero et al. (1998) as a strong indicator of language proficiency. This index in Nasseri (2017) is shown to distinguish between the EFL and English L1 groups’ academic writing. The complex T-unit ratio $( \mathrm { C T } / \mathrm { T } )$ index of subordination is also investigated in some works (e.g., in Casanave, 1994; Lu, 2010, 2011; Lu & Ai, 2015; Kyle, 2016). Casanave (1994) is among the few studies that found a positive relationship between this measure and language development; Neither Lu (2010) nor Lu (2011), on the other hand, found any significant relationship between this measure’s values in argumentative essays and increased proficiency levels.

The next clausal subordination index is DC/C which measures the number of dependent clauses (DC) per clause. This index is also investigated in Lu (2010, 2011), Lu and Ai (2015), Mancilla, Polat, and Akcay (2015), and Kyle (2016) and is one of the important indicators of language proficiency. Both Ai and Lu (2013) and Mancilla et al. (2015) reported the effectiveness of this measure in capturing proficiency differences between the texts of English L1 vs. EFL groups, with the English L1 group producing larger amounts of clausal subordination. Likewise, in Kim’s (2014) study, EFL students with different proficiency levels obtained significantly different scores regarding the values of this measure in their academic writing. A similar measure is the $\mathsf { D C } / \mathrm { T }$ index which calculates dependent clauses per T-unit. Both measures showed either significant difference or no difference between English L1 and EFL or ESL students or between various proficiency levels (Ai & Lu, 2013; Kim, 2014; Lu, 2010, 2011; Lu & Ai, 2015; Mancilla et al., 2015; Nasseri, 2017). Kim (2014) and Alexopoulou, Michel, Murakami, and Meurers (2017), for instance, found a positive relationship between the values of this index and language proficiency. In her review of subordination indices, Ortega (2000) also documents the studies that show the values of DC/T linearly increase with writing experience and proficiency.

The use of coordination structures is also believed to be a characteristic of syntactic complexity in early L2 development (e.g., Ortega, 2000; Wolfe-Quintero et al., 1998) in that the increase in coordination is marked as a developmental stage in L2 writing complexification (Bardovi-Harlig & Bofman, 1989; Wolfe-Quintero et al., 1998). Coordination structures include coordinate phrases (CP), coordinate clauses, and sentence-level coordination. Coordinate phrases, for instance, coordinate/conjoin more than one phrase including noun, verb, adjective and adverb phrases (Cooper, 1976; Lu, 2010, 2014) using coordinating conjunctions.

Among the global coordination indices, the two measures of coordinate phrases per clause $( \mathrm { C P } / \mathrm { C } )$ and per T-unit $( \mathbf { C P } / \mathrm { T } )$ are used more frequently. The $\mathrm { C P } / \mathrm { C }$ index is shown in Lu (2010) to discriminate between three school proficiency levels. The findings of Lu (2011) also indicate that phrasal coordination increases with the increase in proficiency levels. A higher amount of coordinate phrases per clause was also detected in the academic writing of the ESL group compared to the English L1 group in Mancilla et al. (2015); they did not, however, find any such difference regarding the $\mathrm { C P / T }$ index. Both Kim (2014) and Lu (2010) also found $\mathrm { C P } / \mathrm { C }$ to discriminate between proficiency levels; Ai and Lu (2013) equally reported that this measure could distinguish between English L1 and EFL groups’ academic writing.

Phrasal complexity and sophistication indices are among the most-commonly-used syntactic measures in studies on linguistic performance, proficiency (differences) as well as register variation studies. McNamara, Crossley, and McCarthy (2010), for instance, reported that phrasal-level syntactic complexity features are good distinguishers of L2 academic writing quality. Biber and Gray (2013), Biber, Gray, and Poonpon (2011), as well as Liu and Li (2016) equally recommend the investigation of phrasal-level structures like noun phrases and nominalised structures as distinct features of advanced academic writing. Liu and Li (2016) further demonstrate that noun phrase postmodification is significantly underdeveloped in MA students’ dissertations compared to published research articles by professionals. Among other studies which investigated noun phrase complexity, Shahriari, Ansarifar, and Pishghadam (2017) found significant differences between Iranian graduate students and expert writers in the production of three types of dependent phrases.

Prominent among phrasal sophistication and complexity measures are the $\mathsf { C N } / \mathsf { C }$ and CN/T indices which calculate complex nominals per Clause and T-units. These two indices are selected and analysed in Kyle (2016) as well as Lu (2010, 2011) and Lu and Ai (2015). Complex nominals based on the specifications of Cooper (1976) and Lu (2010) capture nominal clauses, gerunds, and infinitives in subject position, as well as the nouns plus adjective, participle, appositive, prepositional phrase, and relative clause. The $\mathsf { C N } / \mathsf { C }$ values are reported to show significant differences between proficiency levels in Kim (2014) and Lu (2010), between English L1 vs. EFL students in Lu and Ai (2015), and between the combined EFL learners and the English L1 group in Ai and Lu’s (2013) corpus. Furthermore, in Lu’s (2011) study, this measure captured significant between-level differences except between the last two adjacent school years. Regarding postgraduate-level texts, Liu and Li (2016) showed that MA students produced fewer complex nominals per clause than published writers. Interestingly, in Mancilla et al. (2015), the ESL group is reported to outperform the English L1 group regarding the production of complex nominals. Its conceptually related measure, ${ \mathrm { C N } } / { \mathrm { T } }$ was also employed in several studies (Ai & Lu, 2013; Kim, 2014; Liu & Li, 2016; Lu, 2010; Lu & Ai, 2015; Nasseri, 2017) where significant between-group and between-proficiency differences were reported. Liu and Li (2016), for instance, found a similar pattern in CN/T values and the findings of $\mathsf { C N } / \mathsf { C }$ regarding the differences between MA dissertations and published research articles. Wolfe-Quintero et al. (1998), however, seem to favour the $\mathsf { C N } / \mathsf { C }$ index when it comes to capturing group differences in second language development. The effectiveness of this selection is partly examined in Lu’s (2011) work where $\mathsf { C N } / \mathsf { T }$ could not capture differences between adjacent proficiency levels (marked as school years) while $\mathsf { C N } / \mathsf { C }$ captured between-proficiency of all levels except one. Both measures, however, were found to distinguish between academic writings of learners and expert writers in specialised academic corpora (Larsson & Kaatari, 2020).

The $\mathsf { V P } / \mathrm { T }$ index (verb phrases per T-unit) is another important phrasal complexity measure that calculates the ratio of verb   
phrases to T-units and includes verb phrases with both finite and non-finite verbs. This index is recommended by Wolfe-Quintero   
et al. (1998) and was reported to distinguish between English L1 and EFL groups’ academic writing in Nasseri’s (2017) report. Kim’s   
(2014) study of English L2 students’ academic writing further showed the effectiveness of this measure in distinguishing between   
proficiency levels. However, in Lu’s (2011) study no relationship was found between the values of this measure and proficiency. These studies which assessed the effectiveness of these global ratio-based indices in proficiency-related research vary in their   
research designs i.e., sample size, mode of language, learner vs. academic writing, the number of groups and their English   
language backgrounds, and whether proficiency was defined by holistic rating or by programme level, etc. This variability makes   
it difficult to find a consistent pattern regarding distinct syntactic patterns in academic texts, especially theses/dissertations of   
postgraduate writers with various English language backgrounds. This issue will be further addressed in the following section.

# 3. Syntactic complexification at the crossroads of linguistic proficiency, development, and genre-based writing research

Stemming from SLA studies, there are several explanations and implications of syntactic complexification. First is the contribution of syntactic complexity to writing quality and that certain complex syntactic structures could help the expression of complex ideas and complex relationships between ideas (Beers & Nagy, 2009, 2011). The second is the developmental trend. The relationships between syntactic complexity, proficiency and development are explained at great length in Ortega (2000). In her extensive review, she noticed that the syntactic structures that are acquired late (e.g., in later stages of linguistic development) are considered more complex in what is known as the ‘cumulative complexity hypothesis’; the presence of such structures, therefore, marks higher syntactic proficiency and maturity (see also Di Domenico, 2017). Along this line and based on the cognitive demands and processing load of certain linguistic structures, Bulte and Housen  (2012, p. 36) argue that syntactic subordination structures are “cognitively harder to process than other types of syntactic linking” and therefore acquired later. This view is also linked with the concept of the inherent complexity of linguistic features, or ‘Structural Complexity’ (Housen & Kuiken, 2009). There is a third explanation to syntactic complexification that I address as the ‘Functional View’ which is not necessarily labelled as such in the literature. Many studies have acknowledged that linguistic complexity cannot be understood in isolation, but is to be taken as a function of/elicited based on task (e.g., task type, condition, and complexity), genre, rhetorical features, English language background and L1s of the writers, topic, disciplinary norms, etc (Biber, 2006; Biber & Gray, 2013, 2016; Ellis, 2009; Gray, 2015; Lu, 2011; Lu et al., 2020).

These three explanations for syntactically more complex discourse constitute the main body of literature on syntactic complexity. A review of these studies, therefore, suggests one strand of research and findings regarding the use (the type, amount, and distribution) of syntactic structures produced by students with higher vs. lower linguistic proficiency, as well as those in the texts of English L1 vs. L2 students. Another strand of research focuses on the complex vs. simple syntactic structures and probes into the use of subordination, coordination, and phrasal-level complexity in various writing genres, in academic vs. learner corpora, and in discipline-specific vs. general academic texts. A brief synthesis of these findings is as follows.

Regarding the syntactic complexification of L2 writing development, researchers such as Cooper (1976), Wolfe-Quintero et al. (1998), and Ortega (2000) argue that the L2 developmental stages move from sentence fragments and clauses to an abundance of coordination, then to an abundance of subordination, and at higher levels of proficiency manifest elaboration through embeddedness and the amount of phrasal complexity and elaboration, for example by a frequent use of nominalisation and non-finite verbal forms, as well as a decrease in the number of T-units and sentences and an increase in the length of clauses. Further evidence is provided in several works to show that coordination is higher in English L2 learners who are less-advanced and subordination is higher in higher proficiency levels of L2 as well as English L1 (e.g., Bardovi-Harlig & Bofman, 1989; Chen, Alexopoulou, & Tsimpli, 2019; Grant & Ginther, 2000; Mancilla et al., 2015). Other studies proved that a greater amount of phrasal complexity structures, nominalisation, phrasal elaboration, noun phrase modifiers, as well as phraseological complexity measures is indicative of proficient L2 and/or academic writing (Biber & Gray, 2013, 2016; Bulte & Housen, 2014; Gray, 2015; Halliday, 2004; Larsson & Kaatari, 2020; Liu & Li, 2016; McNamara et al., 2010). Ferrari (2012, p. 283) also argues that according to the ‘Developmental Prediction Hypothesis’, competent L2 learners complexify their texts “at clausal level through the use of nominalisation, rather than merely increasing the number of subordinate clauses”.

Syntactic complexification of English L1 vs. L2 academic writing proficiency and development (e.g., Ai & Lu, 2013; BardoviHarlig & Bofman, 1989; Lu & Ai, 2015; Ortega, 2003 among many others), as well as syntactic complexity differences in English L2 academic writings (e.g., Kim, 2014; Lu, 2011; Yoon, 2017), have already been reported in section 2. These studies are testaments to the increased phrasal complexity not only in the academic writings of English L2 to English L1 but also from lower English L2 proficiency levels to higher levels. Subordination and coordination indices are yet to show consistent results.

However, sparse and insufficient attention has been paid to the description of the syntactic complexity of English texts based on specific disciplines (and sub-disciplines), genres, and rhetorical sections. Biber and Gray (2013), for example, documented how nominalisation has become a unique feature of modern scientific writing, especially academic writing in education, psychology, and history. Much earlier, Biber (2006) investigated grammatical variations in academic registers and argued that, overall, dependent clauses are more descriptive of spoken registers than written ones, and passive verb phrases are distinctly descriptive of written academic registers. Among such multi-faceted studies, Beers and Nagy (2011) also examined two measures of syntactic complexity (clauses per T-unit as a measure of subordination, and words per clause) to identify differences among four writing genres of narrative, descriptive, compare/contrast, and persuasive in a longitudinal study of school English learners. They concluded that syntactic complexity is highly dependent on genre types. Disciplinary variation and clausal vs. phrasal complexity were also investigated in Gray (2015), where a trajectory of increased phrasal complexity and decreased clausal elaboration was noticed from humanities to social sciences to hard sciences. Lu et al. (2020) is a recent attempt at systematically investigating the syntactic features of different rhetorical functions (based on rhetorical moves and steps) in a large-scale corpus of ‘Introduction’ sections of published research articles in social sciences. This study shows significant variation in the use of syntactic complexity indices across rhetorical functions by expert writers.

It seems, therefore, to exist inconsistent evidence of the dominance of either type of structures (subordination/amount of clausal embeddings vs. phrasal complexity) in higher levels of linguistic proficiency, particularly when both English L1 and L2 academic texts are taken into account. Furthermore, there is a dearth of research and evidence about distinct syntactic structures/features in genre-specific and discipline-specific academic texts, especially regarding the syntactic realisations of various rhetorical sections. Flowerdew (2017), for instance, calls for such corpus-based studies with implications for syllabus designers and materials developers in English L2 academic contexts.

# 4. Methodology, research design and research questions

In light of the previous discussions, in this study, I investigate whether various rhetorical sections serving as sub-genres of postgraduate academic writing (the genre of MA dissertations) can be (distinctly) characterised by certain type and amount of syntactic structures as used by students with different English language backgrounds. Using the mentioned nine global syntactic measures of subordination, coordination, and phrasal complexity, I examine the extent of variability among the rhetorical sections regarding the type and distribution of these syntactic structures. This is to find out how much of this variability can be attributed to a main text-intrinsic characteristic (i.e., various rhetorical sections distinguished based on rhetorical and genre features and expectations) and to one main text-extrinsic factor (i.e., the groups of students based on English language backgrounds and academic contexts). This study is also partly a re-examination of the claims and theories on differences of texts produced by English L1 vs. L2 (EFL and ESL) regarding the use of different syntactic structures in writing. In what follows, I use ‘rhetorical sections’ and ‘sub-genres’ interchangeably. The word ‘genre’ is used in the tables and graphs as the short form to denote the same concept.

a Linguistics dissertations included phonology, phonetics, lexical, and syntactic studies. –The classification is based on the dominant subject area; some studies are inter-disciplinary in nature.

# 4.1. Corpus

The data comprises master’s dissertations in Linguistics and language-related disciplines written and shared by three groups with different English language backgrounds of EFL (English as a Foreign Language), ESL (English as a Second Language), and English L1 students. The EFL group are all Iranian nationals but with various L1 and ethnic backgrounds; they have studied and submitted their dissertations in various universities in Iran. The ESL group with various L1 and ethnic backgrounds have studied and submitted their dissertations to various UK universities as part of ESL academic immersion programmes. They have all moved from non-English-speaking countries (e.g., originally EFL students) for the sole purpose of postgraduate studies to share the same academic contexts and materials with English L1s in the UK. The English L1 group are all British nationals (born and educated in the UK) who have studied and submitted their dissertations to various UK universities. The dissertations have been submitted eight years prior to the final analysis of this study; all dissertations were graded as ‘passed’. The corpus comprises 70 dissertations per group, a total of 210 dissertations with the total token count of 3,069,192. The students reassured that language-related proofreading was limited to minor grammar and spelling check. Table 1 shows the distribution of sub-disciplines of applied linguistics in the corpus.

During the text cleaning process, extra elements were removed or fixed manually and automatically, using R (R Core Team, version 3.5.3): Quoted texts (specified by single or double quotation marks) which are not originally written by the students, instances of written/transcribed samples of the research participants, non-English texts, preliminary pages, References, and Appendices, as well as citation of references within parentheses in the main body of texts, unstructured data and non-textual elements, tables, and the dot/period (after et al. and acronyms).

# 4.2. Method

The corpus was then divided into six rhetorical sections of Abstract (Ab), Introduction (In), Literature review (Lr), Method and design (Md), Results and discussion (Rd), and Conclusion (Cn). These rhetorical sections as sub-genres of theses/dissertations have been identified and recommended in academic writing research (e.g., genre studies) as serving distinct rhetorical expectations, genre moves, and organisational patterns (e.g., Bunton, 1998; Hyland, 2008; Swales, 2004; Thompson, 2012). This classification is an extension of the frequently-used IMRD (Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion) structure in genre studies that is often applied to research articles and scientific reports. Following Swales (2004) who considers master’s (MA) dissertations as a distinct ‘genre’, I will investigate predominant syntactic features and strong syntactic predictors in each rhetorical section. The following six rhetorical sections in dissertations are distinguished based on the previous research on distinct genre and rhetorical expectations, and communication goals and strategies that are recognised in each section:

(1) Abstract: A clear heading of ‘abstract’ that includes a summary and objectives of the study, along with brief statements of the methodology, findings, and general or specific implications and contributions of the study (see Bitchener, 2010).   
(2) Introduction: The motivation/rationale for the study, the statement of the problem, primary research questions, a brief overview and/or background (e.g., brief description of previous related research and an evaluation of the present research), the significance of the study and/or a general contribution to the field, the definition of key terms, and the structure of the dissertation (see Bitchener, 2010; Bunton, 1998; Dudley-Evans, 1986).   
(3) Literature review: Extensive and detailed surveys of the subject matter of the study, establishing the main gap(s) and the statements which indicate how the gap is to be filled with the research (see Bitchener, 2010; Bunton, 1998).   
(4) Methodology, method, and design: The methodological issues including the critical evaluation of/rationale for the choice of techniques and methods, the research/study design, research questions, methods of data collection and analysis, and sometimes the statistical procedures (see Swales, 2004; Thompson, 2012). When the statistical procedures are part of/ directly accompany the results, they are considered as part of the next section.   
(5) Results and discussion: The presentation of the main results along with the interpretations and relevant discussions usually accompanied by tables and graphical representations (see Dudley-Evans, 1986; Swales, 2004; Thompson, 2012). In some dissertations that the ‘discussion’ section was presented as a separate chapter, I combined both chapters.

(6) Conclusion: Sometimes under different terms/headings, the conclusion chapters include general and specific conclusive remarks, contributions of the study, theoretical and/or research and/or pedagogical implications, limitations, a summary of the research and findings, and suggestions for further research (see Bitchener, 2010; Bunton, 1998). I excluded the dissertations where extended ‘discussion of findings’ were intertwined with general ‘conclusions’.

To identify the sections, the headings were used in conjunction with the content of the sections/chapters, but the contents were given precedence in the cases where the dissertations did not follow this strict design or where the headings were not clear and/or indicative of the above categories. Token counts were truncated based on the minimum count from any of the three groups. This was done by identifying unusually long dissertations in each group and deleting the re-statements and reexplanations in each sub-section. Therefore, the approximate total token count in each group became 15,400 for the abstract, 81, 600 for the introduction, 339,400 for the literature review, 177,400 for the method & design, 302,500 for the results & discussion, and 106,300 for the conclusion rhetorical sections of the dissertations.

The Syntactic Complexity Analyzer (L2SCA, Lu, 2010) was used to analyse the nine global measures of syntactic complexity as outlined in section 2. For the details of these measures’ reliability, tokenisation, POS tagging processes, as well as the description of all syntactic production units, see Lu (2010).

# 4.3. Research questions

1. What are the effects of groups (as text-extrinsic factors) and rhetorical sections (as text-intrinsic features), as well as their additive and interactional effects, on the variations in the values of syntactic complexity measures?   
2. Which syntactic constructs (subordination, coordination, and phrasal complexity) are recognised as dominant syntactic characteristics of the rhetorical sections of dissertations, and for each group of postgraduate students?   
3. Which of the nine syntactic complexity indices are selected by classification algorithms as the top/strong syntactic predictors of rhetorical section- and group memberships? What are the amount and distribution of the six syntactic structures (clauses, dependent clauses, complex T-units, coordinate phrases, complex nominals, and verb phrases) across the groups and rhetorical sections?

# 5. Statistical procedures, results, and discussions of the findings

The statistical procedures in the following sections are all carried out using R. Table 2 shows descriptive statistics for the nine syntactic measures.

The first type of statistical modelling in this study is linear mixed-effects models. This is to elucidate the effects of each rhetorical section and the groups of students, as well as their additive and interactional effects on the values of these syntactic measures. This is also to single out the effect of a text-intrinsic variable (i.e., the rhetorical sections of dissertations) and a textextrinsic factor (i.e., the groups of students with various English language backgrounds) overall and to understand which effect explains more variation in each measure’s estimates.

Prior to conducting this test, the residuals of these syntactic measures are extracted from the fitted regression models. The Q-Q plots of residuals (differences between the observed and predicted data points) are shown in Graphs 1 and 2. The following graphs generated in R show these measures with a dot (e.g., CN.C instead of $\mathsf { C N } / \mathsf { C } )$ . The plots confirm homoscedasticity for all of these syntactic measures and the absence of any significant deviations from the normal distribution of the residuals, which is a pre-requisite for conducting regression-based models. However, I used robust statistics such as bootstrapping to compensate for the presence of outliers. The link to the supplementary materials (R code and the extended results including these proficiency differences) is provided in the end notes.

The Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) also indicate only mild collinearity between predictors (i.e., between groups and rhetorical sections: the VIF $< 4 \dot { }$ ). To counterbalance the effect of multiple significance testing (e.g., for several syntactic indices) and the possible increase of type I error rates, the new Bonferroni-corrected alpha level of 0.005 for the syntactic tests were applied to the models’ p-values as indicated in Table 3.

Graph 2. Quantile-Quantile plots of residuals of the syntactic measures when rhetorical sections are the predictors.

The linear mixed-effects models as opposed to the general linear models, incorporate by-subject variability and account for multiple responses/data points for each student for each rhetorical section of the dissertations. All four specified models have the same random effect: a random intercept to account for the by-student variability, i.e., to account for the variability among the six data points produced by each student for each rhetorical section. The mixed-effects modelling was conducted using the lme4 package (version 1.1e21, Bates, Machler, Bolker,€ & Walker, 2015). The R squared values for the fixed effects of the models are the $R ^ { \hat { 2 } } m$ outputs from the MuMIn package (version 1.43.6, Barton, 2019  ), and finally the model comparison fit indices of AIC (Akaike Information Criterion; smaller AIC values indicate better model fit), Log-Likelihood (the likelihood of particular values for model estimates or parameters; larger values denote better model fit given the data), and Chi-square and its accompanied p-values from the likelihood ratio tests were derived from the anova function in Base R.

The mixed-effects models for the effect of groups confirm that English L1 texts have higher syntactic complexity overall, followed closely by the ESL group; the EFL group produced the least-syntactically-complex texts.

The analyses of all syntactic measures in Table 3 show the best fitting model is the model with the interaction of groups and genre as the fixed effects, and the next best-fitting model is the model with the additive effects of these two predictors. The difference between these two models is significant for most of the indices as indicated by AIC and the Chi-square tests of model comparison. With regard to the interactional model, the largest correlation coefficient $( \mathsf { R } ^ { 2 } )$ value among the syntactic indices is recorded for both CT/T and DC/T $\mathbf { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 9 ,$ ) and the smallest $\mathsf { R } ^ { 2 }$ value is recorded for $\mathrm { C P / T }$ (coordinate phrases per Tunit, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathsf { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 7 \cdot } \end{array}$ ).

The difference between the two models which isolate the effects of groups and genre is a straightforward and consistent one. Since these two models are non-nested, AIC values are better suited to compare them. Between the two, the genre-only models receive much lower AIC values for all syntactic measures. This indicates that, between the effects of groups and genre (rhetorical sections), genre variations are more predictive of variations in all syntactic complexity measures.

This table also shows that overall, rhetorical sections manifest more variations in complex nominals $\mathrm { ( C N / C , }$ , $\mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 4$ and CN/T, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 9 . } \end{array}$ ) followed by dependent clauses (DC/C, $\mathbb { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 9$ ) suggesting that some of the rhetorical sections have very high or very low amounts of complex nominals. The table also shows that overall, the isolated effect of groups of students manifest more variation in subordination measures of $\mathrm { C T / T }$ $\mathbf { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 0 $ followed by $\mathsf { D C } / \mathrm { T }$ $\mathbf { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 9 )$ and DC/C $\mathrm { T } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 8 )$ , suggesting that clausal and subordination structures are more discriminatory among these groups. When the interaction of the two variables is considered, the subordination structures are shown to be better predictors.

To examine which groups and rhetorical sections are specifically characterised by each of the three constructs of subordination, coordination, and phrasal complexity, I invert the research question to examine the effects of these syntactic measures on the classification of groups and rhetorical sections, using the second type of statistical modelling. This is to investigate the presence of any dominant syntactic structure in each of the rhetorical sections and groups separately. I take advantage of the available machine learning (ML) classification algorithms in R for prediction purposes. This method determines the most important predictors of syntactic complexity among the nine subordination, coordination, and phrasal complexity indices for groups and rhetorical sections, using the variable importance features in the random forest algorithm in the caret package (version 6.0e84, Kuhn, 2008).

Numerous researchers point out several advantages in using a random forest algorithm over other predictive methods (e.g., Kuhn, 2008). Random forest is robust to multicollinearity (i.e., correlated predictors, in this study’s case, correlated syntactic measures) because of using the ‘Feature Bagging’ which is the use of a subset of features/variables at every stage. Furthermore, random forest does not have the assumption of the normality of the data because of the bootstrapping method in sampling, and hence robust to outliers. It also internally does the data standardisation, which is important when the variables have different scales/metric.

To comply with the assumption of independence of data points in the ‘groups’ model, I used a genre-aggregated dataset (i.e., the data points corresponding to the six rhetorical sections from every student were aggregated to one data point). It is noteworthy that a model’s parameters directly affect these performance indices and the variables selected as important predictors by the model. This parametrisation process is carried out in this study based on the recommendations of Probst, Wright, and Boulesteix (2019).

Table 4 shows the performance indices for two models that take the syntactic measures as the predictors and rhetorical sections and groups as dependent variables. These two models are accompanied by the variable importance Graphs of 3 and 4.

As is shown in the above table, the random forest classifier could more easily classify the values that belong to the EFL group which suggests that this group is distinctly different from the other two groups in the production of these nine syntactic measures. It was, however, more difficult for the classifier to distinguish the ESL and English L1 groups which is indicative of their similar performances regarding the use of these syntactic structures overall. However, there are distinct trajectories of the use of these syntactic structures in each group as illustrated in Graph 3.

This graph shows that subordination is the dominant syntactic characteristic of the texts (i.e., the entire dissertations) written by the EFL group; this is indicated by the importance values of complex T-units and dependent clauses as strong predictors of the EFL group relative to the other two groups. Coordination with the two indices of $\mathrm { C P } / \mathrm { C }$ and $\mathrm { C P / T }$ has the strongest presence after subordination. Finally, we notice that the values of the complex nominals (both $\mathsf { C N } / \mathsf { C }$ and $\mathsf { C N } / \mathsf { T }$ combined) have the least distinguishing power to classify the EFL group. This trajectory of subordination, then coordination, then phrasal complexity as syntactic characteristics of the EFL dissertations is partially in line with the studies that I reviewed in section 3 regarding less-linguistically-advanced/proficient learners. Coordination in this study, for instance, is shown to be much higher in the EFL group than English L1s. Similarly, phrasal complexity is much higher in the texts of English L1s which, based on previous studies (e.g., Ai & Lu, 2013; Liu & Li, 2016; Lu & Ai, 2015), denotes higher linguistic proficiency and/or advanced academic writing. This is particularly interesting as the amount of subordination in the dissertations of the EFL group is considerably higher than phrasal complexity. Regarding the three phrasal complexity measures also, the EFL group produced more verb phrases than nominal structures.

e F1 score is the weighted average (harmonic mean) of recall and precision. Recall or sensitivity is the ability of a classifier to find ALL relevant correct classes; it is calculated as true positives/true positives $^ +$ false negatives. Precision or the positive predictive value is the ability of a classifier to identify ONLY relevant correct classes; it is calculated as true positive/true positives $^ +$ false negatives. a - model parametrisation: 5-fold cross validation & max sample size $= 1 1 9$ , mtry $= 5$ , ntrees $= 5 0 0$ . b - model parametrisation: 5-fold cross validation & max sample size $= 7 0 7$ , mtry $= 9$ , ntrees $= 5 0 0$ .

The ESL group, however, produced similar amounts of clauses $\mathrm { : } C / \mathrm { T }$ measuring the depth of clause as stated by Ortega, 2000) and complex nominals (both $\mathsf { C N } / \mathsf { C }$ and $\mathrm { C N } / \mathrm { T } )$ . The lower amount of dependent clauses and higher total clauses also shows that the ESL group produced higher amounts of independent clauses than the EFL group. This is a new and interesting finding that might indicate that, based on the presumed trajectory as mentioned in section 3, the ESL group seems to be at a transitory stage between EFL and English L1 as will be further discussed.

Comparing the EFL and ESL groups also shows higher syntactic proficiency of the ESL group, for example regarding the increased amounts of phrasal complexity based on the findings of previous studies (e.g., in Kim, 2014; Yoon, 2017) as well as the decreased amounts of coordination. Bulte and Housen (2014)  investigated the linguistic indicators of writing proficiency of ESL students during one semester in an academic language programme (an intensive EAP course) using several syntactic measures; by the end of this EAP course, learners produced longer, more complex phrases. Based on the trajectory of syntactic development and proficiency in the studies that were reviewed, this study’s findings show that syntactic complexification increases from EFL to ESL, to the English L1 groups’ dissertations.

The syntactic features of the English L1 dissertations are, interestingly, marked by the distinct use of phrasal complexity, both as the number of complex nominals and verb phrases, as well as subordination (i.e., $\mathrm { C T / T }$ and $\mathrm { D C } / \mathrm { C } )$ . As mentioned earlier, a complex T-unit contains at least one independent clause and at least one dependent clause; the strong presence of dependent clauses (DC/C), therefore, shows that subordination in English L1 dissertations is primarily the use of dependent clauses. We also see the absence of coordination as predictors of this group’s syntactic complexity. This trajectory of phrasal complexity then subordination in advanced academic writing is partially supported by several previous studies (Biber & Gray, 2013, 2016; Halliday, 2004).

These findings suggest that the text-extrinsic syntactic features of the dissertations written by the combined groups, are marked by the strong presence of subordination indices, particularly complex T-units and dependent clauses, as indicated by the vertical axis in Graph 3 which lists the overall important predictors of group membership.

Regarding the classification of rhetorical sections based on the values of these nine syntactic measures, we notice a medium-range accuracy (Table 4) across all rhetorical sections which suggests that these sections are not significantly different from each other in terms of the type of these syntactic structures as produced by the three groups combined. This could be because each dissertation (e.g., the six rhetorical sections) is written by the same writer and it is expected that, overall, any student should maintain a similar style of writing throughout a dissertation. However, there are some syntactic structures that seem to be specific to certain rhetorical sections as demonstrated in Graph 4. This graph shows interesting text-intrinsic syntactic features in each rhetorical section, particularly with regard to complex nominals as indicated by the overall important predictors in the vertical axis. This result is consistent with the results of mixed-effects models for the isolated effect of rhetorical sections. That is, in the entire corpus of dissertations (combined groups), complex nominals variations among the six rhetorical sections make them strong predictors for classifying these sections.

Graph 4. Important syntactic predictors of rhetorical sections of dissertations.

The strongest presence of complex nominals as measured based on clauses $( \mathsf { C N } / \mathsf { C } )$ is in the short texts of abstracts and based on the T-units $( \mathsf { C N } / \mathsf { T } )$ is in the method & design sections, suggesting that these two rhetorical sections of academic writing comprise greater amounts of nominal structures. This finding is also supported by previous studies that characterise abstracts as lexically dense and nominal. Yoneoka and Ota (2017), for instance, revealed that high-quality scientific abstracts contain a small proportion of verb phrases and a larger proportion of noun phrases.

The complex T-units index $( \mathrm { C T } / \mathrm { T } )$ is also ranked among the top three strong predictors for classifying these six rhetorical sections, with its largest amount in the long texts of literature review, followed by method & design and results & discussion sections. This is also reflected in larger amounts of clauses $( \mathbf { C } / \mathrm { T } )$ as well as dependent clauses (DC/C and $\mathsf { D C } / \mathrm { T } )$ in these sections. Among these three rhetorical sections, however, literature review sections are distinctly characterised by dependent clauses, while the method & design and results & discussion sections contain similar amounts of subordination and phrasal complexity. These two latter sections are the most syntactically complex sections of postgraduate dissertations, as indicated by larger amounts of the three constructs of subordination, coordination, and phrasal structures.

The conclusion sections are noticeably characterised by greater amounts of verb phrases among these syntactic structures; literature reviews, however, contain the greatest amounts of verb phrases among all other rhetorical sections, making them predominantly subordinate and verbal. The introduction sections did not show any distinct syntactic feature; this is reflected in very similar amounts of all types of syntactic structures and measures investigated in this study.

Concerning the pairs of measures which have either clause or T-unit as the denominators, $\mathrm { C P } / \mathrm { C }$ seems to slightly better capture variations in all rhetorical sections than $C { \mathrm { P } } / { \mathrm { T } } ,$ , suggesting that the ratio of coordination at the phrasal level to the number of clauses is more pronounced than this ratio to the number of T-units. However, neither of $\mathsf { C N } / \mathsf { C }$ nor $\mathsf { C N } / \mathsf { T }$ is predominantly larger across all sections, indicating that nominal structures are frequent when considered both to the number of clauses and T-units. The same goes for the DC/C and $\mathsf { D C } / \mathrm { T }$ pair: neither of these production units shows greater amounts of dependent clauses across all rhetorical sections.

# 6. Concluding remarks: revisiting research questions, implications, and recommendations

This study employed two robust statistical modelling methods for the description of modern English academic writing (the genre of master’s dissertations). The results of mixed-effects modelling showed that incorporating both the rhetorical sections as text-intrinsic features of theses/dissertations and English language backgrounds (EFL, ESL, English L1) based on academic/acquisition contexts for grouping the postgraduate writers, better explains the variations in the values of the selected syntactic measures, than isolating these two effects. The model with the isolated effect of groups indicates that, overall, subordination indices can better describe the syntactic variations between the three groups. The model with the isolated effect of rhetorical sections, on the other hand, testifies to the variations in complex nominals (i.e., as distinguishers of these sections).

To find the specific/distinct syntactic characteristics (e.g., structures and measures) in each group and each rhetorical section, I inverted the research question to take the syntactic measures as predictors this time. Using random forest as a classification machine learning method, I then constructed two models that characterise the EFL group’ texts as dominantly subordinate in nature, followed by medium amounts of coordination and low amounts of phrasal complexity. The ESL group produced similar and medium-range amounts of subordination and complex nominals. Finally, the English L1 dissertations are featured by a great amount of phrasal complexity, followed by subordination structures. The short abstracts are predominantly phrasal (complex nominal structures) with coordination to join these phrasal structures. Literature reviews are distinctly subordinate in nature, then phrasal. The two sections of method & design and results & discussion are the most syntactically-complex sections, featuring large amounts of subordination, coordination, and phrasal complexity. The introduction sections do not have a distinct syntactic structure, but the conclusion sections are distinctly verbal (verb phrases).

It is hoped that this research inspires other researchers to systematically describe modern English academic texts as important contributions to writing research. Genres (and rhetorical sections as sub-genres), task types (e.g., thesis/dissertation writing), and the type and number of indices, therefore, play important and inter-related roles in determining the quality and complexity of academic writing, and as Beers and Nagy (2009, p. 192) underline, “writing high-quality texts in different genres … involve acquiring productive control over genre-specific structures that are tied to the communicative goals of writing”. Nesi and Gardner (2012) equally emphasise the importance of genre-based teaching of academic writing and Flowerdew (2017) calls for disciplinary-variation studies and the usefulness of ‘disciplinary consciousness-raising’ in this regard. Lu et al. (2020) likewise emphasise the importance of form-function relationships and the linguistic realisations of various rhetorical functions in academic writing instruction at advanced stages.

Some of the pioneers of such corpus-based studies support that the findings contribute to teaching practices, syllabus design, and materials development in EFL and ESL academic contexts, particularly discipline-specific thesis and dissertation writing modules (Biber, 2006; Flowerdew, 2017; Hinkel, 2004; Lu & Ai, 2015; Nesi & Gardner, 2012). Despite the mounting evidence on the necessity of research on specific linguistic features of academic writing in ESL or EAP/ESP programmes, systematic investigations are few and far between.

Finally, the findings of this line of research could be incorporated into automatic text classification and identification systems/models (see e.g., Sheehan et al., 2010) as well as in future syntactic complexity studies to aid the measure-selection and assessment processes (see e.g., Lu, 2011, 2017).

I acknowledge several limitations in this study that could be addressed by future researchers, e.g., investigating the effect of students’ L1s, obtaining the holistic evaluation of the quality of texts and proficiency of their writers prior to such analyses, the inclusion of fine-grained grammatical indices, sub-disciplinary variations, and obtaining/tracking such students’ syntactic complexity development, especially the EFL and ESL groups for a more expansive comparison of the trajectories of syntactic complexification of postgraduate academic writing. In line with Biber, Gray, Staples, and Egbert’s (2020) framework for the description of academic writing, I also acknowledge the fact that the global measures employed in this study may not offer nuanced aspects of the structural complexity of academic writing. A detailed qualitative linguistic description of such texts could complement predictive statistical modelling to characterise modern English academic writing.
