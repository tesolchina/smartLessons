Keywords: Subject it-extraposition Academic writing Popular writing Extraposed sentence Main clause predicate

Research has shown that extraposition is more frequent in academic writing than in speech and that students and non-English speaking academic writers have problems with the use of extraposition. With the explosion of scientific popularization over the past decades, popular writing has also become an important register in English for academic purposes. However, few studies have been devoted to comparing the use of extraposition in academic and popular writing. This study attempts to reveal how subject it-extraposition is used in the two registers based on an analysis of the extraposed subjects in the academic and popular writing subcorpora in the British component of the International Corpus of English (ICE-GB). Differences are identified between the two registers in both the forms and meanings of subject it-extraposition. Results show that, in academic writing, passive verbs are more frequent in the main clauses of extraposed sentences, and the most common extraposed clause is that-clause rather than to-clauses. Semantically, academic writing is more concerned with explanation and negotiation rather than evaluation. The results of this study can be used in designing activities in EAP to raise students' consciousness of register variations in the use of subject it-extraposition and help students to grasp this construction.

# 1. Introduction

There have been many studies on the linguistic features of academic writing over the past decades. One strand of such studies is concerned with comparison of the linguistic features of academic writing with those in other registers, especially speech (e.g. Biber, 1988; Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad, & Finegan, 1999). With the explosion of scientific popularization in recent years, popular writing has also become an important register. As the Royal Society's report in 1985 argued, public understanding of science can be a major element in promoting national prosperity, in raising the quality of public and private decision-making and in enriching the life of the individual. According to Bowler (2009), over the last two decades, scientists have realized that they need to make a more serious effort to engage with how their work is presented to the public.

However, few studies have compared the linguistic features of academic writing with those of popular writing, which is viewed as “rhetorical transformation” of academic writing (Swales, 1990: 125). Academic writing, including research articles, academic books and textbooks, is texts written by academics mainly for academics. In contrast, popular writing, including popular science books and articles in newspaper, magazines or journals, is intended for the public. Academic writing strives to explain the research and convince the readers of the truth of the findings, while popular writing tries to “balance between the two facets of what made literature about science attractive to the public: information and entertainment” (Bowler, 2009: 4). Fahnestock (1986: 279) maintained that the main purpose of popular writing (“scientific accommodations” in his terms) is to “celebrate rather than validate”, and that popular writing needs to resort to “epideictic rhetoric” so that the audience can recognize the significance of information.

Extraposition is a special type of postponement involving the use of anticipatory it for the postponed linguistic element as in examples (1) and (2). In a sentence with subject it-extraposition, the main clause expresses the stance of the writer and the extraposed element presents the content of the proposition.

(1) In a perilous nuclear world, it is surely possible for leaders and communicators to appreciate that the benefits which come from manipulating the national identity dynamic are short-term and short-sighted. (ICE-GB W2A-017 #43:1)   
(2) It was suggested that time spent on the development of the system would be amply repaid if it made entry of data more speedy for the employee. (ICE-GB W2A-016 #96:1)

With impersonal it as provisional subject, this construction can disguise the source of opinion, thus making it appear more impersonal or objective (e.g. Herriman, 2000a; Hewings & Hewings, 2002). Therefore, it has been found that extraposition is more frequent in academic writing than in speech and some other registers. According to Biber et al. (1999: 676), the overall frequency of extraposed that-clauses of conversation, fiction, news and academic prose is “more than 200 times per million words, rising to more than 500 times per million words in academic prose”. Herriman (2000b) found that the frequency of extraposition in the Popular Lore text category of the LancasterdOslo-Bergen Corpus (LOB) of British English is 1.73 times per 1000 words (p. 218) while in the Learned and Scientific category, it is 3.19 times per 1000 words (p. 220).

Studies have revealed that both native and non-native students (Adel, 2014; Charles, 2000; Hasselgård, 2009; Herriman, € 2013; Hewings & Hewings, 2002; Hyland & Tse, 2005a; Thompson, 2009) as well as non-native speaking academic scientists (Rowley-Jolivet & Carter-Thomas, 2005) need to improve their use of such a construction. There have been studies on the use of extraposition in academic writing, but most of them excluded extraposition with passive matrix predicates (e.g. Adel, 2014; € Groom, 2005; Rodman, 1991; Romer, 2009€ ), or focused only on extraposed that clauses (Hyland & Tse, 2005b). Herriman's (2000b) study involved different types of main clause patterns and extraposed elements, but covering 15 text categories in LOB, it could not systematically compare the functions of subject it-extraposition in the Learned and Scientific category and Popular Lore, which can be viewed as corresponding to the academic and popular writing registers in this study because they are similar in their readership and sources of texts.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate subject it-extraposition in the two registers in a more comprehensive way by including all types of main clause patterns and extraposed elements and by comparing both the forms and meanings of this construction. To achieve this purpose, this study seeks to address the following research questions:

1. How frequent is subject it-extraposition in academic and popular writing?   
2. Which types of clauses are extraposed in the two registers?   
3. What are the clause patterns of extraposed sentences in the two registers?   
4. What meanings are conveyed by main clause predicates of extraposed sentences in the two registers?

# 2. Theoretical framework

# 2.1. Syntactic analysis of subject it-extraposition

Most previous studies on subject it-extraposition involve its syntactic analysis, namely, the types of extraposed clauses or syntactic constraints of extraposed elements (e.g. Huddleston & Pullum, 2002; Kaltenbӧck, 2004; Quirk, Greenbaum, Leech, & Svartvik, 1985). But Mair (1990) and Collins (1994) are among the few who formulated the main clause patterns of extraposed sentences. Since this study attempts to give a comprehensive description of the use of extraposed sentences in the two registers, in addition to classification of extraposed elements, it involves an analysis of the main clause patterns of not only extraposed infinitive clauses investigated by Mair (1990), but also other forms of extraposed elements. Therefore, I followed Collins' (1994: 10e11) classification in analyzing the main clause patterns of extraposed sentences, which identified four major types of clause patterns:

“Subject $^ +$ Predicator $^ +$ Complement”   
“Subject $^ +$ Predicator”   
“Subject $^ +$ Predicator $^ +$ Object”   
“Subject $^ +$ Predicator $^ +$ Indirect Object $^ +$ Direct Object”

2.2. Semantic classification of the main clause predicates of extraposed sentences

There has been a proliferation of semantic classification of the main clause predicates of extraposed sentences. Most of them are only concerned with the adjectives used in the main clauses of extraposed sentences (e.g. Biber et al. 1999; Charles, 2000; Groom, 2005; Kaltenbӧck, 2004; Mindt, 2011), while some involve not only adjective phrases but also noun phrases and prepositional phrases in the main clause predicates (e.g. Collins, 1994; Herriman, 2000a). As Herriman (2000a: 584) rightly put it, “there is no set of exhaustive, semantic categories in which meanings may be organized and there are no foolproof, clear-cut criteria by which semantic categories may be clearly distinguished from one another.” I selected Herriman’s (2000a: 585e586) classification as theoretical framework for the semantic analysis of main clause predicates, because her study not only specifies the definition of different categories and subcategories with examples, but also provides the semantic classification of all the main clause predicates in her study in an appendix, which proved to be a very useful reference for classifying the matrix predicates in the present study. She distinguished four semantic domains of matrix predicates other than passive verbs in LOB:

Epistemic modality including those predicates expressing “the speaker's opinion of the truth of the content of the extraposed clause …” (e.g. it is clear/true/likely), the speaker's claim of “the existence or coming into existence of the content of the extraposed clause (e.g. it happens/follows), and “the perception of the existence of the content of the extraposed clause …” (e.g. it occurred to me) (p. 585)   
Deontic modality representing “obligation, i.e. the speaker's opinion of the degree of obligatoriness of the content of the extraposed clause (e.g. it is necessary/imperative/our duty), … and volition (intention, desire, or will) of the speaker or a participant in the clause as regards the content of the extraposed clause …” (e.g. it is desirable/preferable) (p. 585)   
- Dynamic modality typically involving a participant's “ability or power to carry out a course of action” and subdivided into: potentiality (potential success and thus also the ease or difficulty) (e.g. it is difficult/impossible/practical); circumstances (i.e. speed, manner, safety, cost) (e.g. it is safe/dangerous/quicker), and human attribute (i.e. the speaker's opinion of certain properties which can be attributed to the subject of the extraposed clause as a result of his or her actions in that clause …”) (e.g. it is arrogant/considerate) (pp. 585e6)   
- Evaluation involving general evaluation (“favourability or unfavourability”) (e.g. it is good/better/a pity), appropriateness (“correctness or suitability”) (e.g. it is relevant/right/disgraceful), significance (“degree of importance”) (e.g. it is important/ significant/noteworthy), frequency (e.g. it is usual/common/unusual), emotive reaction (e.g. it is tempting/interesting/not surprising), and responsibility (contingency or inevitability) (e.g. it is no accident/no coincidence) (p. 586).

Since Herriman's classification does not include passive verbs as matrix predicates in extraposed sentences, a framework must be selected for the semantic classification of matrix verbs of extraposed sentences. I adopted Biber et al.’s (1999: 361e364) semantic classification of single-word verbs, which distinguishes seven major semantic domains of verbs:

Activity verbs which are concerned with what people do (e.g. use, give, make, build, perform, measure)   
Communication verbs involving such communication activities as speaking and writing (e.g. describe, discuss, debate, argue, introduce, suggest)   
- Mental verbs describing cognitive states and activities (e.g. know, believe, remember, understand, consider, design, study, investigate), which also include attitudinal or emotional states (e.g. prefer, love, enchant)   
Verbs of existence or relationship denoting a relation or a state exists between entities (e.g. include, represent, define, link, associate, relate, influence)   
Verbs of facilitation or causation indicating a new state of affairs brought about (e.g. cause, allow, require, need, influence)   
Verbs of simple occurrence reporting the occurrence of events (e.g. develop, grow, increase, change)   
Aspectual verbs denoting the stage of progress of events or activities (e.g. keep, continue, hold).

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Corpus

This comparative study is based on the academic writing and popular writing (also termed non-academic writing) sub corpora in the informational writing category of ICE-GB (the British component of the International Corpus of English). The ICE-GB corpus consists of one million words sampled across 32 text categories (200 written and 300 spoken texts), and all samples date from 1990 to 1993, which is intended as a representative sample of British English (Nelson, Wallis, & Aarts, 2002).

This corpus was used in this study for several reasons. First, it is syntactically parsed as will be discussed below. Secondly, the sample size of subject it-extraposition in the two subcopora is manageable for such a study. More importantly, the subcorpora of academic writing (labeled W2A) and popular writing (labeled W2B) in the ICE-GB corpus are parallel (85,628 and 86,643 words respectively), each consisting of 20 texts of around 2000 words in four major disciplines d humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and technology.

# 3.2. Data retrieval

Every sentence in the ICE-GB corpus is parsed for syntactic structure. In addition, the corpus is supplied with a retrieval software, the International Corpus of English Corpus Utility Program (called ICECUP III), which allows the users to search for individual words as well as abstract syntactic structures (Nelson et al., 2002). In this study, the samples of the subject it-extraposition in the two registers were extracted by searching the function of “Provisional Subject” through the Fuzzy Tree Fragments (FTFs for short) used in the ICECUP III software. In academic writing, 184 instances of provisional subject were found, but one was excluded because it is conditional $i f .$ -clause, which is a debatable case, because extraposed conditional $i f .$ -clause as in (3) and when-clause are not viewed as extraposed subjects by Quirk et al. (1985: 1392). Huddleston and Pullum (2002: 962) also noted that “as $i f$ phrase cannot function as subject, so there is no question of extraposed subject analysis for this construction”. Similarly, five such instances were also excluded from the 163 instances of provisional subjects in popular writing because their extraposed clauses are conditional $i f .$ -clauses, as $i f .$ -clause, and before-clause as in (4) and (5).

(3) … it would be strange indeed if after a glimpse of life in a Los Angeles penthouse apartment they did not find their own living conditions squalid and inadequate. (ICE-GB W2A-019 #51:1)   
(4) Sometimes it appears as if social workers cannot win in the eyes of the public, no matter what they do. (ICE-GB W2B017 #12:1)   
(5) Being blessed with a shade of inspiration and a suitably strange sense of humor, it wasn't long before the innards were plucked out and replaced with a slightly different circuit. (ICE-GB W2B-032 #7:1)

Thus, respectively 183 and 158 samples of subject it-extraposition were retrieved in the academic and popular writing subcorpora.

# 3.3. Data analysis

In the frequency analysis, three different measures were used to provide a clear picture of how frequent subject itextraposition is in academic and popular writing. Despite the similar size of the two subcorpora, the number of subjects in them is different (6144 vs. 7322). Since what is investigated in this study is subject extraposition, occurrences of subject it-extraposition per thousand subjects were regarded as the main criterion for frequency comparison. Chi-square was used for the statistical hypothesis testing. According to Quirk et al. (1985: 1391), extraposition “operates almost exclusively on subordinate nominal clauses”. In order to show how frequently the extraposable subjects are extraposed in the two registers, percentage of extraposed subjects out of all the subject clauses is also provided. For the convenience of comparison with previous studies, frequency in terms of occurrences per thousand words is also given.

As regards the classification of verbs into semantic domains, Biber et al. (1999: 361) mentioned a problem: “for some verbs there is no single correct classification, since they can be used with different meanings belonging to more than one category”. For example, the verb take which was classified as an example of Activity verb in Biber et al. (1999: 367) can also be a verb of Facilitation or Causation when it means require. Since the sample in this study is fairly small, manual analysis has been carried out to overcome this problem. Instead of coding each verb form by one label without differentiating their meanings as in some large-scale research, I classified verbs with different meanings as they are used in different contexts. For example, it is found that the verb take in this study was not an Activity verb, but a verb of Facilitation or Causation as in (6). In addition, the phrasal verbs and prepositional verbs (rather than just the single-word verbs) were analyzed as one semantic unit, so point out in (7) was classified as Communication verb.

(6) The concentrations of sodium, potassium and calcium inside and outside cells are very different, and it takes energy to maintain these concentration gradients. (ICE-GB W2A-024 #31:1)   
(7) It was pointed out that they were not levied according to ability to pay, so that rich and poor boroughs might pay the same amount. (ICE-GB W2B-019 #70:1)

For semantic comparison, no significance testing was used because it is unlikely to find statistical differences between the semantic subcategories due to the small sample size of the present study and the multiplicity of the subcategories. Thus, the difference in the semantic classification measured in percentage only represents linguistic difference.

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Frequency of subject it-extraposition

In academic writing, there are 183 extraposed $( 7 4 . 7 \% )$ and 62 non-extraposed subject clauses $( 2 5 . 3 \% )$ , while in popular writing there are 158 extraposed $( 7 2 . 5 \% )$ and 60 non-extraposed subject clauses $( 2 7 . 5 \% )$ . As shown in Table 1, the frequency of subject it-extraposition in academic writing is 29.8 per 1000 subjects or 2.1 per 1000 words, whereas in popular writing it is 21.6 per 1000 subjects, or 1.8 per 1000 words. As can be seen, subject it-extraposition is more frequent in academic writing by all three measures. In terms of occurrences per 1000 subjects, the subject it-extraposition in academic writing is significantly more frequent $( \chi ^ { 2 } = 9 . 1 9$ , $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 0 2$ ). This probably has to do with the convention of objectivity of academic writing.

4.2. Forms of the subject it-extraposition in academic and popular writing

# 4.2.1. Types of extraposed clauses

Table 2 shows that, in academic writing, the most common type of extraposed subject clauses are that-clauses $( 5 0 . 8 \% )$ as in (8), followed by infinitive to-clauses $(4 7 \% )$ , while in popular writing, the most common type is infinitive to-clauses $( 5 4 . 8 \% )$ as in (9), followed by that-clauses $( 3 9 . 2 \% )$ . The frequency of that-clauses in academic writing is significantly higher $\langle \boldsymbol { \chi } ^ { 2 } = 4 . 5 9$ , $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 3 2$ ). This is probably because this construction has been used to express different meanings in the two registers, which result in different predicates and thus different types of extraposed elements.

(8) It has been observed that there is little evidence that Anglo-French tension “was any more unbearable in 1293 than it had been earlier”. (ICE-GB W2A-010 #25:1)   
(9) … and it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the young Dickens, walking through these fitfully illuminated streets, watching the passers-by, did not create his own stories out of his head just as he had done in the Marshalsea. (ICE-GB W2B-006 #109:1)

Among the extraposed subject clauses, there are also interrogative subordinate clauses (wh-) introduced by how far, how much, and to what extent in academic writing as in (10), and by why, whether, how long, how quickly, and if (meaning whether) in popular writing as in (11). In popular writing, there are also four extraposed zero that-clauses as in (12). In both registers, all the extraposed non-finite subjects are to-infinitive clauses except one -ing participle clause.

(10) We know the energy cost of pumping 1 mol, but it is unknown how much energy is used for this process per unit time in the body as a whole. (ICE-GB W2A-024 #33:1)   
(11) It is not clear how long they stayed here e … (ICE-GB W2B-006 #47:1)   
(12) We were advised to have our luggage ready as it was quite possible we might be flying on to Rio de Janeiro. (ICE-GB W2B-004 #111:1)

Among the to-infinitive clauses, there are eight for-to clauses in academic writing and 11 in popular writing as in (13) and (14).

(13) It was quite impossible for them to find replacements for losses upon this scale, and they resorted to paying preachers stipends to travel around circuits. (ICE-GB W2A-006 #30:1) (14) It's all too impersonal and distant for these assets to flourish. (ICE-GB W2B-013 #66:1)

# 4.2.2. Main clause patterns of extraposed sentences

Table 3 presents the percentage and raw frequency of the three different main clause patterns. As shown in Table 3, the most common main clause pattern of the extraposed sentences in the two registers is “subject $^ +$ predicator $^ +$ complement” (SPC) as in (15) to (18), but this pattern is less frequent in academic writing than in popular writing $6 8 . 3 \%$ vs. $7 6 . 6 \%$ ), though no significant statistical difference was found.

Table 3 Distribution of the main clause patterns of extraposed sentences.   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Academic</td><td> Popular</td></tr><tr><td> SPC</td><td>68.3% (125) (113 ADJPs, 9 NPs, 3 PPs)</td><td>76.6% (121) (100 ADJPs, 21 NPs)</td></tr><tr><td>SP.</td><td>31.7% (57) (46 passives, 10 copular, 1 intransitive)</td><td>20.2% (32) (20 passives, 8 copular, 4 intransitive)</td></tr><tr><td> SPO</td><td>0.6% (1)</td><td>3.2% (5)</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>183</td><td>158</td></tr></table></body></html>

(15) It is significant that they thought it necessary to provide any justification at all. (ICE-GB W2A-001 #48:1)   
(16) It seemed natural to the monks to turn to France, now the seat of architectural fashion. (ICE-GB W2B-003 #79:1)   
(17) Having accepted over the years this level of government intervention and market manipulation, it really should not have been such a steep hill to climb to accept state ownership and management. (ICE-GB W2B-016 #18:1)   
(18) The concentration of free calcium inside cells is lower than outside by about two orders of magnitude, and it is of crucial importance for many vital processes that the internal concentration should be maintained at the correct level. (ICE-GB W2A-024 #36:1)

In this pattern, the most frequent verb of extraposed sentences in academic writing is be (118 out of 125), the others being become (four occurrences), appear, seem, and prove (one occurrence each). In popular writing, the most frequent verb is also be (111 out of 121), and the other verbs are seem (six occurrences), become (three occurrences), and look (one occurrence). As regards the complements of the main clause verbs, the overwhelming majority are adjective phrases (ADJPs) as in examples (15) and (16), especially in academic writing. In academic writing, noun phrases (NPs) are also used as complements of main clause verbs in the SPC pattern (9 out of 125) as in (17), but the frequency is much lower than in popular writing (21 out of 121). In academic writing, there are also three prepositional phrase matrix predicates as in (18).

The second most common pattern in both registers is “subject $^ +$ predicator” (SP) as in (19), (20) and (21), but the proportion of this pattern is significantly higher in academic writing than in popular writing $3 1 . 7 \%$ vs. $2 0 . 2 \%$ ) $\cdot x ^ { 2 } = 5 . 2 2$ , ${ \bf p } = { \bf 0 } . 0 2 2$ ), probably because of the preference for passive verbs in the main clauses by academic writing (46 out of 57 or $8 0 . 7 \%$ vs. 20 out of 32 or $6 2 . 5 \%$ in popular writing). This demonstrates that passive verb predicates represent an important type of predicates of extraposed sentences in academic and popular writing.

Intransitive and phrasal verbs are also used in such a pattern, including happen in academic writing, and transpire, fall, follow and turn out in popular writing as in (20) and (21).

(19) Too often it is simply assumed that disagreement over values within a community is proof of the subjective character of the rival attitudes. (ICE-GB W2A-005 #37:1)   
(20) In more distal platform areas, it could happen that the prograding tidal flats did not arrive, so that subtidal conditions were maintained throughout. (ICE-GB W2A-023 #99:1)   
(21) In the 1960s, it turned out that Yugoslavia's national question was much more serious than in the 1930s. (ICE-GB W2B007 #91:1)

The “subject $^ +$ predicator $^ +$ object” (SPO) pattern as in (22) is very rare in both registers, with one instance in academic writing and five in popular writing.

(22) However it needs a fair bit of experience to keep them properly and most of them die in captivity fairly soon. (ICE-GB W2B-021 #79:1)

4.3. Meanings of main clause predicates of extraposed sentences

In the following, the semantics of the main clause predicates of extraposed subject clauses in the two major main clause patterns (SPC and SP) will be analyzed respectively.

4.3.1. Meanings of the predicates in the SPC main clause pattern

As shown in Table 4, in academic writing, the most common semantic category of predicates in the SPC pattern is Epistemic modality which denotes the Truth of the content of the extraposed clause as in (23) and (24). It will be clear from the previous chapter that … in (23) conveys the certainty of the following proposition. In (24), it is possible to … means that the following proposition can be true. Epistemic predicates are slightly more frequent in academic writing $3 9 . 2 \%$ vs. $3 5 . 5 \%$ ), indicating that academic writing is more concerned with the likelihood of propositions.

(23) It will be clear from the previous chapter that the innovations currently being implemented in industry and business involve both technological and organizational systems. (ICE-GB W2A-011 #2:1)   
(24) In such a simple act it is possible to glimpse far more clearly than in any number of statistics the pressure of a highly defined and stratified society, literally forcing the young boy down into a position of deference. (ICE-GB W2B-006 #31:1)

The second most common semantic category is Evaluation which is slightly less frequent in academic writing than in popular writing. Moreover, the subcategories of the Evaluation category in the two registers differ (see Table 4a): In academic writing Significance as in (25) is the most common Evaluation, accounting for $3 4 . 2 \%$ of the Evaluation category, followed by Appropriateness $( 2 9 . 3 \% )$ as in (26). In popular writing, the most common category is Appropriateness $( 3 6 . 4 \% )$ followed by Emotive Reaction $( 2 5 \% )$ as in (27) and General Evaluation as in (28). Evaluation of Frequency of the extraposed proposition as in (29) is also quite common in academic writing (seven occurrences), while it occurs only once in popular writing. This indicates that popular writing prefers to evaluate whether the following proposition is appropriate.

As shown in Table 4, the matrix predicates concerning Dynamic modality are slightly less frequent in academic writing $1 6 \%$ vs. $2 0 . 7 \%$ ). The majority of the predicates in this semantic category are Potentiality as in (30) and those representing Circumstance as in (31) are very rare.

Table 5 shows semantic classification of the verbs in the main clauses of extraposed sentences in the “subject $^ +$ predicator” pattern by Biber et al.’s (1999) semantic classification of single-word verbs. As shown in Table 5, the three major semantic domains of the matrix verbs in this clause pattern in both registers are Mental verbs as in (34), Communication verbs as in (35) and verbs of Existence or Relationship as in (36). It can be seen that Mental verbs and Communication verbs are more frequent in the extraposed sentences in academic writing, while the proportion of Existence or Relationship verbs is very close in extraposed sentences in the two registers. Such mental verbs as assume, expect, believe specify how academic writers are involved in the extraposed proposition.

4.4. Meanings of main clause predicates and types of extraposed subject clauses

Table 6 illustrates the distribution of the types of extraposed subject clauses used with different semantic categories of main clause predicates in the SPC clause pattern. As shown in Table 6, respectively $6 7 . 3 \%$ and $6 5 . 1 \%$ of the extraposed subjects used with the Epistemic category of main clause predicates in academic and popular writing are finite clauses. Conversely, in the Evaluative category, the percentages are respectively $2 9 . 3 \%$ and $3 6 . 4 \%$ . Interestingly, none of the Dynamic predicates in both registers are used with extraposed finite clauses. All the Difficulty/Ease main clause predicates are used with extraposed to-infinitive clauses. Also, none of the Deontic predicates in popular writing and a small percentage $( 1 3 . 3 \% )$ in academic

# 5. Discussion

As discussed below, the results from this study, on one hand, affirm previous research findings, and on the other hand, yield some new findings.

5.1. More frequent use of subject it-extraposition in academic writing and preference for passive matrix predicates in extraposed sentences by academic writing

This study shows that subject it-extraposition is more frequent in academic writing. This provides further evidence for previous findings by Biber et al. (1999) who found that the frequency of extraposed that-clauses in academic prose is much higher than in conversation, fiction, and news, and by Herriman (2000b) who noted that the frequency of extraposition in the Learned and Scientific category more than doubled that in Popular Lore.

Conventionally, academic writing has been viewed as ‘dispassionate description of truth’ (Penrose & Katz, 1998: 169), a register in which the facts ‘speak for themselves’. However, the interpersonal functions of academic writing have been noted in substantial research on academic writing (e.g. Hunston, 1993; Hyland, 1998, 2002; Hyland & Tse, 2005a; Kuo, 1999). Hunston (1993) claimed that scientific writing is not just factual but also contains a considerable amount of attitudinal meaning. According to Hyland and Tse (2005a: 124), “academic writers are contributing to an ongoing scholarly debate, they are simultaneously seeking to present propositional information while persuading readers of their claims.” Therefore, on one hand, academic writers need to involve themselves in the written communication. On the other hand, they have the objective or impersonal convention of the academic community to observe. Then, subject it-extraposition can meet this purpose and disguise their opinion in objectivity.

Such a function of subject it-extraposition has also been noted by Collins (1994: 19e20) who found “a large array of thematic expressions used to convey ‘objective modalities’”, by which the speaker can ascribe “to an unspecified source the responsibility for an assertion”. Thus, he concluded that extraposed sentences provide the means for “claiming objective necessity or certainty for what in fact may be a matter of opinion”. Similarly, Herriman (2000b: 212) observed that it enables writers “to conceal the source of their opinion, if wished, thus making it appear to be objective”, and giving it “an appearance of objectivity and generality”.

Interestingly, the dominance of the “subject $^ +$ predicator $^ +$ complement” matrix pattern revealed in this study is close to Collins' (1994: 11) result of $7 0 . 5 \%$ in his contemporary Australian English corpus of writing and speech. However, the proportion of the “subject $^ +$ predicator” pattern in academic writing $( 3 1 . 7 \% )$ is significantly higher than in popular writing $( 2 0 . 2 \% )$ , which is very close to the $2 0 . 5 \%$ in a corpus of Australian writing and speech used by Collins (1994). This can be attributed to the more frequent use of passive verbs in the main clauses of extraposed sentences in academic writing. The proportion of passive matrix predicates of subject it-extraposition in academic writing attested in this study is much higher not only than in popular writing but also than in the 15 text categories in LOB, which is roughly one quarter (Herriman, 2000b: 206). When subject it-extraposition with passive matrix verbs (e.g it is suggested that …) instead of the active pattern (e.g I/we suggest that …) is used, the writing seems to be more impersonal. Therefore, passive predicates are a very important type of matrix predicates of subject it-extraposition in academic and popular writing, and I argue that studies on extraposition in these two registers would not be complete without inclusion of this type of extraposition.

# 5.2. Prevalence of explanation and negotiation over evaluation in academic writin

More frequent matrix predicates in the Epistemic category and less frequent matrix predicates in the Evaluative category indicate that academic writers are more concerned with the extent to which the extraposed proposition is true by specifying whether it is possible, clear, apparent, likely, or unlikely than whether it is nice, better, best, or interesting, because it is necessary for successful academic writers to persuade their readers to accept their ideas (Charles, Hunston, & Pecorari, 2009). In addition, when making value judgment of the extraposed proposition, writers of academic writing are more likely to evaluate the Significance and Frequency of the extraposed proposition than making General Evaluation about it as in popular writing. For instance, all the 11 instances of important in academic writing in this study are used to explain the procedure or process as in (40) and (41) rather than evaluate the importance of the product.

(40) For marine animal lines that might move on to land through sandy shores and sand dunes, it is important to consider the final step in the transition, between dune soils and inland terrestrial soils. (ICE-GB W2A-022 #81:1)

(41) It is important in NDT inspection to be able to differentiate between these two categories so that problems of structural integrity are spotted early. (ICE-GB W2A-036 #63:1)

The higher proportion of Deontic and lower proportion of Dynamic matrix predicates demonstrate that academic writers are more likely to provide the precondition for the feasibility of a process or the validity of the proposition as in (42) than commenting on the potential success of the extraposed proposition or how easy or hard it is as in (43). This seems to reflect Myers' (1990: 142) observation that in popularizing articles, “the plant or animal, not the scientific activity, is the subject” and that “the syntax and vocabulary emphasize the externality of nature to scientific practices”.

(42) For the third class of theory to appear inside a program, it is necessary for its generalities to be backed up by enough specific details to allow the program to compute something of interest. (ICE-GB W2A-035 #34:1)   
(43) In fact, as you switch between different Tones while programming, it's all too easy to forget which Tone, if any, the physical position of a slider refers to. (ICE-GB W2B-031 #50:1)

In addition, more frequent use of Mental verbs in the main clauses of extraposed sentences in academic writing reveals academic writers' involvement with the extraposed proposition (e.g. assume, believe, conclude, decide etc.). More frequent Communication matrix verbs (e.g. suggested, argued, admitted) in academic writing indicate that the extraposed proposition in academic writing is more negotiable. The negotiability of academic writing is not only evidenced by the higher proportion of Communicative verbs, but also by the more negotiable verbs suggested and argued as the most common Communicative matrix verbs used in academic writing instead of the more assertive announced in popular writing.

Findings from the semantic analysis in this study provide empirical evidence for the observations and findings about the communicative functions of academic writing in previous research. According to Hyland (2008: 2), “academic writing is persuasive” and “at the heart of the academic persuasion is, then, the writers' attempts to anticipate possible negative rejections to their claims. Therefore, they not merely present the results but also elaborate on the process, and they negotiate their arguments by such words as suggesting, arguing, or even admitting. The tendency that scientific writing is less concerned with overtly providing value judgments and more with establishing factual information was also observed by Herriman (2000b).

In contrast, the texts in popular writing were intended for a wider readership both to entertain and inform non-expert readers. Popular writers “must usually be explicit in their claims about the value of the scientific discoveries they pass along” (Fahnestock, 1986: 279). Therefore, evaluative matrix predicates is more frequent in the subject it-extraposition in popular writing.

5.3. Interaction between meanings of main clause predicates and types of extraposed clauses

The data show that interaction exists between the meanings of main clause predicates and the type of extraposed clauses. A similar tendency in the use of subject it-extraposition is perceived in both registers despite their different proportion: In the SPC main clause pattern, Epistemic predicates favor finite clauses (predominantly that-clauses) as extraposed elements, while Evaluative predicates prefer non-finite subject clauses. Dynamic and Deontic predicates are very rarely used with extraposed finite clauses.

Mair (1990: 25) observed that “matrix predicates representing Epistemic modality do not normally occur with extraposed infinitival clauses”. Herriman (2000a) who excluded extraposition with passive matrix predicates also found that among the subject it-extraposition in the LOB corpus, $6 4 \%$ of the subject that-clauses represent Epistemic modality (p. 587), that a large proportion $( 4 0 \% )$ of the matrix predicates of extraposed infinitival clauses in the LOB corpus represent Evaluation (p.590), that a small proportion $( 4 \% )$ of the extraposed that-clauses in LOB represents Deontic modality (p. 588), and that there was only one instance of extraposed that-clause for Dynamic matrix predicates (p. 589). This study demonstrates that such an interaction exists no matter whether the extraposed elements are infinitival clause or that clause, and no matter whether the matrix predicates are adjectives or passive verbs. This provides further evidence for Sinclair’s (1991: 65) observation that “there is a strong tendency for sense and syntax to be associated”.

In addition, this study also indicates that behind this general trend, the type of extraposed subject clauses used with different semantic categories of matrix predicates are also word-specific. For instance, despite the predomi nance of extraposed finite clauses used with Epistemic predicates, the adjective possible predicator is mostly used with extraposed to-infinitive complement clauses (16 out of 20 in academic writing and 12 out of 16 in popular writing).

# 6. Conclusion

To conclude, this study shows that the anticipated different readership of academic writing and popular writing has resulted in differences in the use of subject it-extraposition construction. Subject it-extraposition is more frequent in academic writing and a larger proportion of extraposed elements in academic writing are finite clauses. This study also reveals more frequent use of “subject $^ +$ predicator” matrix pattern because of the preference for passive matrix verbs in subject it-extraposition by academic writing. With respect to the meanings conveyed by the matrix predicates of subject it-extraposition, it is found that Epistemic and Deontic categories are more common in academic writing, while Evaluation and Dynamic categories are more prevalent in popular writing. This study has also identified regularity in the interaction between the forms and meanings of subject it-extraposition in the two registers.

Given the differences found in forms and meanings of subject it-extraposition in the two registers, EAP practitioners should be conscious of register variations in teaching such a construction. The lists of classifications provided in this study can be used to develop various activities or exercises (e.g. blank filling exercises on choice of predicates for extraposed sentences or of the extraposed elements) to help students grasp the use of this construction. EAP practitioners may also need to explain the differences in meanings expressed by different predicators in the same semantic category to help students use this construction to express their stance more accurately in their academic and popular writing practice. Since this study is based on general academic writing, the lists are more suitable for general academic writing courses. In addition, they can also serve as a starting point for more discipline-specific activities. For example, EAP practitioners can ask students to compare the forms and meanings of subject it-extraposition in their own disciplines with those in this study.

While this study has yielded some interesting and useful findings, it has several limitations. First, since the classification was based on quite small corpora and not all texts are full texts, they may not well represent the two registers. Second, this study did not address disciplinary variations evidenced by several studies (e.g. Charles, 2000; Groom, 2005). Thirdly, the semantic classification involves subjectivity. Therefore, a larger sample of subject it-extraposition is needed to provide further evidence for the findings in this study. In addition, more research remains to be done on subject it-extraposition with passive matrix predicates, which was mostly excluded in previous studies on extraposition.
