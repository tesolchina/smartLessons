The ability to produce fluent and coherent written text impacts learning and attainments. Valid and reliable assessments of writing are needed to monitor progression, develop goals for writing and identify struggling writers. In order to inform practice and research a systematic review was conducted to investigate which writing productivity measures captured writing development and identified struggling writers in elementary school. Sixty-seven empirical studies were identified for inclusion, appraised, and their data extracted under the themes of writing genre, duration of writing task, use of priming of topic knowledge prior to the writing assessment, use of planning time, writing modality, gender, age of participants and learning difficulties. Total Number of Words and Correct Word Sequences were the most common means of measuring productivity. Productivity varied significantly between genres and durations of writing tasks and was higher in girls than boys. Students with learning difficulties scored significantly lower in writing productivity when compared to typically developing peers. Insufficient research was available to draw conclusions regarding the effects of priming of topic knowledge, planning and modality on writing productivity. Study limitations, links to the assessment of writing and recommended further research are discussed.

Writing is a higher order skillthat develops over time through interactions between the child's sills and cognitive resources the instructional context, and the demands of the writing task (Kellogg, 2008). Sigificant advances have ben made in our understanding of writing development and the demands placed on the writer. By corollary there has en an increase in research designed to identify effectie aroaches to the teaching of writing ee special ssue of Reading and Writing, Vol 34, No 7: Teaching Writing toElementary Grade Students) and targeted interventions (Gillespie & Graham, 2014). Conceptual and practical advances are underpinned by reliable and valid asssments of written products and an awareness of their strengths and limitations. Text produced at word and sentence levels are commonly used metrics to evaluate the writen product f children in elementary school. Although the amount of text produced is not the ultimate goal of writing, longer texts allow ideas to be articulated, developed and elaborated with suficient detail (Kim et al., 2014). The current stematic review focuses on metrics used to evaluate text production in elementary school measured in terms of the amount of written text generated (words, utterances or ideas) in a composition (Dockrell t al., 2018; Puranik et a., 2008) and the accuracy of the amount of text produced (correct word sequences) in order for benchmarks to be established. To our knowledge, no systematic review has yet examined dfferences i the measures of text production acrosthe elementary school grades and the factors that are associated with the amount produced and text accuracy. The current systematic review aims to address this gap in our understanding of count measures that capture children's written products and, where possble, provide indicative benchmarks for assessments and interventions.

The assessment of writing is dependent on sensitive measures of writing competencies; that i, measures which reveal the student's ability to produce a written text and capture the characterisics of proficient writing competence. Asessment of writing has been identified as problematic, wth suggetions that it i the single greatest barrier to both writing instruction and rearch (Cole, Haley, & Muenz, 1997; Dockrell & Conelly, 2021). Early studies regarding written composition identified quality and productivit as key dimensions fr asessment (Berninger & Swanson, 1994; Graham et al, 1997; Olinghouse & Graham, 2009), with the quality of writing products operationalised through the content and organisation of information (Graham et al., 1997; Wechsler, 2009) and productivity operationalised as the number of words, sentences, or ideas produced within the writing products, sometimes described as writing fluency (Abbott & Berninger, 1993; Kim et al., 2011). Assesing qualit or productivity alone fails to capture the multidimensional nature of writing, typically excluding macrostructure (text organization, structure and cohesion at the whole-text level) and micro-structure elements (complexity and mechanics at a word, sentence or whole-text level) (Dockrell & Conelly, 2021; Kim, Al Otaiba et al., 2015 Koutsoftas, 2018). Nonethelesscount metrics of the amount and the accuracy f text produced continue to feature as a key component in writing models,as an indicator of struggling writers and a component asessed in several writing intervention studies (Puranik et al., 2008; Salas et al., 2021). These measures are important as they are stronglycorrelated with writing quality (Puranik et al, 008). Measures of text produced are important as they are, typicall, more reliable than assessments of writing quality and as such are an ideal starting point for systematicall examining changes over development and establishing developmental benchmarks (Puranik et al., 2008). However, to do so requires an understanding of which measures vary across development and which factors are associated with performance.

To date there has been no consistent approach to identifying which measures of the written product should be considered and developmental benchmarks have yet to be established. A wide range of metrics have been used to evaluate children's written products, variously referred to as productivity, fluency and accuracy (see for example htps://ww.interventioncentrl.org/assessment/ writing assessment elementary; Abbott & Berninger, 1993; Kim, Puranik et al., 2015). These metrics have considered both the amount produced and the accuracy of the text produced. The amount written has been captured by Total Number of Words (TNW), numbers of sentences, ideas and/or punctuation marks (Beers & Nagy, 2011; Dockrell et al., 2018; Kim, Al Otaiba et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2014 Puranik e l., 2008; Ritchey & Coker, 2014; Scott & Windsor, 2000; Dockrell & Conelly, 2020). Accuracy measures, by contrast, relect the grammatical accuracy and complexity of the produced texts. Metrics have included Corrct Word Sequences (CW; the number of two adjacent writing unit, such as words or punctuation, that are grammatcally correct and spelled correctly), clauses, and T-units (defined as consisting of a main clause plus allsubordinate clauses and non-clausal structures that are attached or embedded to it). ws, Words Spelt Corrctly (wsC), and the ierence between the number of CwS in a writing sample and the number of incorrect Cws (CIws) are often considered the most reliable measures of acurate text production (McMaster & Campell 2008) with strong technical adequacy across grades. However, differentia patterns ofpeformance acros the measures have not been systematically addressed. Both TNW and CWS are considered robust measures of writing development (Kim et al., 2014; Weisset al., 2019), that are sensitive to age (Wagner et al., 2011; Koutsoftas, 2018; Dockrell & Conell, 2015), and strongly correlated with teacher ratings (Gansl et al., 2004; Jewell & Malecki, 2005) and standardised writing asessments (Dockrell, onnelly, Walter, & Critten, 2015; Gansle et al., 2006; Jewell & Malecki, 2005). There is growing evidence that text production metrics can be used successfuly in research and practice (Piercy & Dockrell, 2023). However, correlations weaken as children become more competent writers (Kim et al., 2014; Weissenburger & Espin, 2005), comparisons between different metrcs of written text production are underexplored and longitudinal dat are rare. In the current systematic review we examine data on diffrent measures of wrtten text production capturing amount and accuracy to examine the possbility of producing reliable developmental benchmarks.

Written text production is also influenced by task and child factors. Factors related to the writing task include the length of time children write for, the genre, modality of the text and the preparation children engage in before they write. While child factors including age, gender and learning disabilities, have allbeen shown tobe associated with written text production. Table 1 outlines different tasks used to capture children's written text production. As the table shows tasks include Curriculum Based Measures of Writing (CBM-W), standardised asessments and bespoke tasks designed for specific studies. CBM-W tasks in response to a writing prompt are the shortest tasks, lasting between three and five minutes and can be cored for numbers of words written or grammatical accuracy Dockrell, onell, Walter & Crite, 2015; Kim et al, 2014). These measures are more ensitive with younger writers and with struggling writers. Standardised assessments can involve longer writing times such as the writing fluency subtest of the

Woodcock-Johnson Tests of Acheivement-3 which allows children to write for seven minutes (Woodcock et al., 2001), the essay composition subtest of the Wechsler Individual Achievement Tet-II (Wechsler, 2009), or the story composition subtest of the Test of Written Language-4 (Hammill & Page, 2009) where children write for $1 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ (Kim et al., 2014). More complex prompts with longer writing durations are reported to be more valid for older learners (Espin et al., 2008; Espin et al., 2005; McMaster & Campbell, 2008)

Writing tass also differ in genre including narrative writing genres such as personal narratives and story narratives or expository writing genresuch as informational, compare-contrast and persuasive writing (Beer e al., 2018). Most research studies have focused on narrative writing, with limited data in other genres (Beers et al., 2018; Puranik et al., 2008). For example, the AIMSweb (NCS Pearson, 2012)produces normative data for written expression providing guideline for tww, cWs, and wsC, but uses only narrative writing prompts. The AIMSweb draws on two studies (Gansle et al., 2002; Jewell & Malecki, 2005) both included in the current systematic review. The focus on narrative writing alone is problematic,as there is indicative evidence that writing metricsare not stable acrossall genres (Dockrell et al., 2018; McMaster & Campbell, 2008). More text is produced in narrative writing than in expository writing (Bers & Nagy, 2011; Hall-Mills & Apel, 2015; Puranik et al., 2008), while writing complexity is higher in expository sample (eer & Nagy, 2011; Hall-Mills 2010; HllMills & Apel, 2015; Koutsoftas & Gray, 2012; Scot & Windsor 2000) However, McMaster and Campbell (2008) state that narrative writing appeared to be the most promising in terms of its technical adequacy across grades. xpository writing is known to take longer to master, requires more complex vocabulary and places a greater cognitive load on the writer (Dockrell & Connelly, 2021) and, as such, productivity measures to capture writing competence may differ. Finall, chde can proce text using different mdlies such as hndwriting  ting les e al., 2008 and withdifferent opportunities to plan the content of the written product (Koutsoftas & Gray, 2013; Llaurado & Dockrel, 2019). To date how these different task factors are related to metrics of written text production has not been systematically examined.

Child-based factors, such as gender and learning disabilities, also are associated with writing performance. Girls consistently outperform boys on writing asessments across grades (Kim, Al Otaiba et al., 2015; Truckenmillr et a., 2014; Fearrington et al., 2014). This gender performance gap widens during the middl school years (Maleck & Jewell 2003) and has been shown to be greater when the writing time is longer (Berninger et al., 2008). Children with dyslexia (Sumner e al., 2013), dysgraphia (SmitsEngelsman & VanGalen, 1997) and language difficulties (Dockrel et al., 2007) all show reduced amounts of text produced, although the factors which undrin thee diffce likly differ (Dckrell, onl,  Arfe 2019; Dkrell et a., 014. Thdiffiie eist across the writing modalities of handwriting, typing and use of stylus (ers et al, 2018; Corkett & Benevides, 2016; Berninger et al., 2009). CWS are reported to differentiate learners with writig disabilitie from typically-developing learners (Kim et al., 2014; Weis et al. 2019) whereas TNw show mixed resuts (Weis et al., 2019). However, again, lack of normative data for typical and struggling writers makes identification of delays and differences challenging.

The production of spontaneously produced written text is key to children's academic attanment. To inform our understanding of children's production of written text we synthesised available data reporting production of Tw, cws, number of different words produced, number of sentences produced, length of T-units length of sentences and number of ideas produced acrosthe elementary school grades. There were two main research questions: 1. To what extent do current datallow the establishment of reliable and valid benchmarks for text production (amount and accuracy)? 2. To what extent are these writing metrics associated with task- and childbased factors?

We anticipated that more complex measures of writing productivity (CWS and T-Units) would differentiate performance at the upper ends of elementary school while for younger children TNW would be a reliable indicator. We also reasoned that children with developmental difficulties would produce lesstext at all ges. By contrast the opportunity to plan and priming of topic knowledge should improve text production for allchildren. To maintain the focus of the review on empirical studies examining metrics of written text production inclusionary and exclusionary criteria were developed.

# 1. Method

This systematic review was conducted and reported following guidance from the 2020 PRIsMA statement (Page et l., 2021) and the EPPI-centre (Gough et al., 2017).

# 1.1. Selection criteria

To address the research questions, empirical studies were selected that met the following criteria:

(1) Children with typical development and/or children with developmental difficulties.   
(2) Elementary school children in Grade 1 to 7, between six and 13 years of age.   
(3) Assessments that involved written expression.   
(4) Studies that included metric of written text production such as the total number of words, clauses sentences or ideas produced within the writing products, irrespective of the task format e.g., CBM-W tasks, standardised assessments and/or unstandardised/bespoke writing tasks.   
(5) Studies in which participants were assessed in their language of instruction.   
(6) Studies conducted and reported in English. This aids comparability across written products and reduces potentialdifferences across orthographies and morphological complexities (see Dockrell & Connelly, 2021).   
(7) Studies published between 2000 and 2021. Published literature and grey literature were included.   
(8) Assessment using any modality to produce written text.

# 1.1.1. Exclusion Criteria

Studies were excluded from analysis if:

(1) Samples were from Kindergarten (USA), Reception and Year 1 (UK) to exclude floor effects.   
(2) Studies that used a single case experimental design were excluded due to sample size as their baseline data would not be appropriate for generalisation.   
(3) Studies that had insufficient data to code task dimensions (e.g., genre and/or writing task duration) as the data could not be categorised and analysed.   
(4) Studies involving only copying or dictation tasks as they are not generative writing tasks. If astudy included data on both copying/dictation and generative writing tasks, the independent writing data were included in this systematic review.   
(5) Samples including children with acquired disabilities such as traumatic brain injury, were excluded in order to maintain the focus on writing development.

# 1.2. Location and selection of studies

# 1.2.1. Databases

Educational, psychological and general databases were used as well as library services. Databases included the British Education Index, Australian Education Index, Open Grey, ProQuest Central, ERIC, PubMed, PsychArticles, Scopus and Web of Science.

# 1.2.2. Boolean search terms

Search terms were identified following a review of the relevant literature, discussion with writing researchers and support from the library review team. A Bolean search was then used in each database to identify relevant records (see Appendix A). The Boolean search included terms associated with writing productivit, elementary school years and asessment. Terms relating to preschool education, secondary school years and adults were excluded. The database search was conducted on 16 February 2021.

# 1.2.3. Selection of studies

Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied in two stages: during the title and abstract screening and then during the fulltext screening by the frt author and discussed with the second author. Data were unavailable in the public domain for two theses from two university oline libraries and were requested by the irt author. The reference lists of each of the included stdies were also searched. The selection proces i summarised in Fig.1. ixty-seven studies met the incusion criteria and these re marked \*in the reference ist.

# 1.3. Data extraction and coding

# 1.3.1. Data extraction

Following guidance from the PRIsA statement (Page et al., 2021), information from the 67 included studies was recorded on a spreadshee including information related to the output (authors, date of publication, country of study), study aims, characteristics of the participants recruited, methodological features of the writing assessment (writing task type, writing duration, writing modality, priming of topic knowledge, opportunity to plan prior to writing) and a summary of results.In experimental studie, only pre-test scores were extracted, with the exclusion of post-test scores and intervention effects (see Appendix B).

# 1.4. Quality appraisal

In line with guidance from the PRIMA statment (Page et l., 2021) and the EPPI-centre (Gough et al., 2017), aquality apraisal of the included studies was conducted. Most quality appraisal checklists target aspecific type of research design (Critical Appraisal kils Programme, 2018; Joanna Brigs Institute, 2020), yet the included studies in this paper held multiple study designs. As such a modified bespoke critical apraia checklist was used acrossall study designs to asess the rigour of the included studies. The checklist focused on evaluating the studies sampling methods, asessment methods, coding and scoring of data. This checklist was developed through combining the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme Checklists (Critical Appraisal kills Programme, 2018), JBI Critical Appraisal Tool Checklists (Joanna Briggs Institute, 2020) and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment to0l (Higgins & Thomas, 2021). The checklis can be found in Appendix C with the results from the studies' appraisals in Appendix D.

# 1.5. Data analysis

Extracted data were grouped by variables of writing genre (Appendix E), gender (Appendix F), growth by term (Appendix G) growth by week (Appendix H) and use of planning (Appendix I) to investigate the research questions.

# 2. Results

The results of the systematic review are presented in two sections. First, a summary of the 67 included studies' characteristics is reported. Secondly, data were gathered in themes to answer each research question where suficient studies using the target metrics were available.

# 2.1. Study characteristics

# 2.1.1. Study location and sample size

The majority of studies were conducted in the United States $( n = 5 8$ $8 6 . 6 \%$ with the remaining studies being in the United Kingdom $( n = 5$ $7 . 4 \%$ , Canada $( n = 3 , 4 . 4 \% )$ and Slovenia5 $( n = 1 , 1 . 5 \% )$ . The sample sizes ranged from five to 1240 children $M =$ 201, $S D = 2 2 7 . 4 \AA$

# 2.1.2. Frequency of writing assessment

The majority of studies measured written text production at a single time point for each grade $( n = 5 8$ $8 6 . 6 \%$ , with the remaining $( n = 9$ $1 3 . 4 \%$ ) measuring growth over time within an academic year: every term in fall, winter, and spring $( n = 3 , 4 . 4 \% )$ , twice a year $( n = 4$ $6 \%$ ) and every week for 12 weeks $\lceil n = 2$ $3 \%$

# 2.1.3. Metrics of written text production

Typically, studies used more than one indicator of writing productivity $( n = 4 6$ $6 8 . 7 \%$ . As Table 2 shows the most common indicators used were TNW $\hphantom { 0 } n = 6 0$ $8 9 . 6 \%$ ) and CWS $( n = 2 9$ $4 3 . 3 \%$ ) with larger textual units (number/length of sentences, length of Tunits) being markedly less frequent.

# 2.1.4. Frequency of grades being assessed

Table 3 presents the frequency of grades assessed within the studies. As the table shows most f the studies focused on Grades 2 to 4, although there were data available across the elementary school years. Two studies $( 3 \% )$ combined data for Grade 7 and 8, yet were retained due to the Grade 7 data meeting the inclusion criteria. In four studies $( 6 \% )$ , the mean age of cohorts was given without providing grades. For the purposes of this study, the data from these cohorts were matched to the closest grade or, if between two grade brackets, represented as a combination of both grades.

# 2.1.5. Genre across grades

Table 4 provides details of all the writing genres presented in the studies. The majority of studies $( \mathtt { n } = 5 3$ $7 9 . 1 \%$ ) assessed only one genre, with story narrative being the most frequently assessed $\mathbf { \tilde { n } } = 4 2$ $6 2 . 7 \%$ , followed by personal narrative $\mathbf { \tilde { n } } = 1 0$ $1 4 . 9 \%$

# 2.1.6. Samples assessed

Table 5 provides details of the approach to writing assessment that were used in the identified studies. Fifty-five studies $( 8 2 . 1 \% )$ investigated only one group and typically data were collected as a whole class activity $( \mathtt { n } = 4 1$ $6 1 . 2 \%$ , which included both learners with typical development and learners with learning difficulties present in the mainstream class.

# 2.1.7. Duration of writing tasks

Table 6 provides details of the duration of the writing tasks used. Typically, these involved a short writing task of three-minutes $\mathbf { \tilde { n } } = 2 2$ $3 2 . 8 \%$ ) or five-minutes $( \mathtt { n } = 1 4$ $2 0 . 9 \%$ . Comparisons of the effect of writing duration were rare, with only four studies making a comparison $( 6 \% )$

# 2.2. Priming of topic knowledge

Most studies $( \mathtt { n } = 6 1$ $9 1 \%$ ) did not use any form of priming of topic knowledge. The six studies that introduced the topic prior to writing used reading comprehension ${ \mathfrak { m } } = 2 \gamma$ , listening comprehension $\left( \mathbf { n } = 1 \right)$ , class discussion to brainstorm ideas $( \mathbf { n } = 1 )$ , use of a model text $( \mathbf { n } = 1 )$ , watching a movie $( \mathtt { n } = 1 $ ) and reading comprehension combined with retell $( \mathbf { n } = 1 )$ . Five of these six studies used expository writing genres.

# 2.2.1. Planning time

The provision of planning time for writing was infrequent, with only $3 0 \%$ $( n = 2 0 )$ ) providing time to plan. When planning time was provided this ranged from $3 0 \ : s$ $\scriptstyle \overbrace { n = 6 } )$ to $4 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ $\scriptstyle \left( n = 6 \right)$ , with the modal time provided being one minute $( n { = } 1 3 )$

# 2.2.2. Modality of writing

Ninety-five percent $( n = 6 4 )$ assessed writing using pen/pencil and paper while five studies $( 7 . 5 \% )$ assessed writing using typing and one study a stylus. Three of these studies used typing and/or a stylus to compare learner performance across modalities.

# 2.3. Factors associated with writing metrics

The descriptive data generated from the studies indicated variability in populations sampled and in study measures. TNW and CWS were used to examine relationshipsassociated with writing metrics as these two measures provided suficient data for comparison; while other metrics were used infrequently. For example, t-units was only used in five studies and words spelt correctly in one (see Table 2). We explored the extent to which it was possbleto answer the research questions related to genre, writing duration, priming and topic knowledge, gender and learning disabilities for TNw and Cws.

# 2.3.1. Genre

To allow comparisons across studies that allowed different writing times TNw and cWS per minute were used as the units of comparison across studies, only writing tasks spanning three to $1 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ for each genre were included and studies with data extending across two or more grades were excluded. In total, seven studies were excluded $( 1 0 . 4 \% )$ . Argumentative, persuasive and opinion genres were combined given the limited data for each genre individually and the rationale that they share the core writing characteristic of taking a point of view and supporting it with reasoning (Crowhurst, 1990). The TNW per minute and CWS per minute for each grade and genre can be sen in Figs. 2 and 3 respectively. When more than one study was considered, SD was calculated and presented in the figures.

As Figs. 2 and 3 illustrate there were both developmental trends and genre effects in TNw and cws. Only data for the story narrative genre had TNW and/or Cws data for all grades, making establishing benchmarks dificult. There were fewer data points available for CWS than TNW and, as result, insufficient CWS data were available for the analysis of genres such as personal narrative informational writing, compare-contrast and summaries. For both measures there was significant variability at each age point, with the greatest variability evident in Grade 5.

From the data, sentence writing tass yielded the highest TNw, although it was only used as an asessment for younger writers For sentence writing there was an average words per minute of 5.75 ( $\mathbf { \nabla } S D = 1 . 1 1 , ~ $ in Grade 1, 10.26 ( $S D = 2 . 2 6 \AA$ in Grade 2 and 11.25 ( ${ \boldsymbol { S } } { \boldsymbol { D } } =$ 1.71) in Grade 3. The story narrative genre demonstrated consistently higher writig TNW rates than other genres. However, in some studies the w elicited from story narrative writing prompts was lower than that elicited by descriptie writing prompts (Bers  l., 2018; Coker et al., 2018) and expository writing prompts (Hall-Mills & Apel, 2015; Edman, 2012). In addition, as Fig. 2 shows, in Grade 7, both informational $M = 1 6 . 5$ and compare-contrast $( M = 1 7 . 0 1 $ ) writing prompts elicited higher TNw than the story narrative writing prompts $( M = 1 5 . 0 9 )$ . However, given the data it was not possible to establish whether this difference was statistically significant.

# 2.3.2. Writing task duration

There were more data for the narrative writing genre across ages and samples, and these data were used to examine the influence of different writing durations. Texts from studies that involved typing $( n = 1 , 1 . 5 \% )$ , and/or studies in which results spanned two or more grades $( n = 2$ $3 \%$ were excluded to reduce confounding variables. Figs. 4 and 5 represent the total TNW and CWS produced by learners across the grades by writing times. The data suggest that longer writing durations resulted in longer total length of texts. However, the TNW produced in three-minute and five- to seven-minute tasks was comparable. The provision of longer times (above $1 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ did not appear to increase TNW between Grades 2 - 4. It should be noted that there was no CWS data for writing times longer than $1 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ , as evidenced in Figs. 5 and 7.

Speed of text production (per minute) provides an alternatie measure fr capturing the production of written text across ifferent writing durations. Figs. 6 and 7 represent the TNW and CWS produced per minute by different writing times. The shorter writing time of 3 min increased both TNW and CWS across the grades. With shorter writing times, learners in Grade 7 were producing up to 15.9 words per minute $\langle S D = 1 . 6 7 \rangle$ and 14.9 CWS per minute $\langle S D = 1 . 5 2 \rangle$ . This difference in the speed of output elicited by short and longer writing tasks increased with age. At Grade 1 there was adifference of 5.07 words per minute when comparing writing output on three minute writing tasks $( M = 5 . 9$ $S D = 2 . 7 7 .$ ) and 20 - 60-minute writing tasks $( M = 0 . 8 3$ $S D = 0 . 8 4 \mathrm { \Omega }$ , suggesting that these extended tasks resulted in lower text production rates for the younger children. By Grade 5 the difference in average words per minute was 11.9 when comparing writing output on three-minute tasks $( M = 1 5 . 9 $ $S D = 1 . 6 9 _ { . }$ and 20 -- 60-minute writing tasks ( $M = 3 . 7$ $S D = 2 . 3 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ , likely reflecting the longer texts produced at this age and their ability to engage with the tasks.

# 2.3.3. Priming of topic knowledge

Seven $( 1 0 . 4 \% )$ studies involved some level of priming of content prior to the writing task through class discussion, comprehensions, use of a model text and/or watching a movie. However, these studies did not provide detaled descriptions of the priming method such as the teaching style and teaching methods, duration of priming, or level of engagement of leaners. Additionaly, the studies did not use control groups to compare the influence of the priming activit on TNw/cws. This significantl affects the ability to reproduce, compare, or draw conclusions from these studies.

# 2.3.4. Planning

Twenty-five studies $( 3 7 . 3 \% )$ included an element of planning prior to the writing phase of the assessment. However, none of the studies compared the written output of larners who utilise planning with those who did not, nor compared the efects of different types of planning graphic organisers, drafs, drawings) at different ges. Addtionall, none of the studies providd a rationale for the length of planning time chosen for the asessment. The data were not sufficient to evaluate the relationship between planning types and planning lengths for text productivity throughout the different grades.

# 2.3.5. Modality

The three studies $( 4 . 5 \% )$ that compared TNW produced across modalities presented mixed results. Corkett and Benevides (2016) assesed informational writing in Grade 6 learners with learning difficulty and found writing on an iPad facilitated production of more words $( M = 9 4 . 6 7 $ $S D = 2 7 . 6 7 $ than with pen and paper $( M = 7 4 . 5 6$ $S D = 1 2 . 6 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ . In contrast, Berninger et al. (2009) assessed the informational writing of learners using pen and typing in Grade 2, 4, and 6 and found all grades to produce more words when writing by pen than typing. Berninger et al. (2009) found this to be consistent with typically-developing learners and learners with writig difficulties. Beers et al. (2018) assessed persuasive writing using typing and a stylus in typical, dyslexic and dysgraphic cohorts across Grade 5 - 6 and found all cohorts to produce more words using typing than a stylus. Both Berninger et al. (2009) and Bees et al. (2018) reported that the difference between modalities was greater in the typically-developing cohorts when compared to those with writing difficulties. There were insufficient data to draw conclusions about the effect of modality on productivity.

# 2.3.6. Gender

Eight studies $( 1 1 . 9 \% )$ provided data to evaluate the relationships between gender on TNw amd CWS and each of these studies assessed whole classamples. Of these, only five had gender data for individual grades, while the remaining three studies preset gender data across multiple grades. Only one study examined both expository and narrative writing, while the others asessed narrative writing only. Figs. 8 and 9 present productivity data by gender and grade. The data are displayed as TNw and Cws per minute of writing, to enable comparison between studies with different writing times. Most of the studies $( n = 5 )$ that analysed gender differences in writing focused on assessment i younger Grades 2 and 3. Only Fearrington e l. (2014) provided data for Grades 4-7 and as aresult, the data in Fig. 8 and 9 hould be inrpreted with caution. Nonetheles the dat indicatdtrend, ugsting that girls produce more text than boys throughout Grades 2 - 7, with a suggestion that the performance gap might widen with age.

# 2.3.7. Learning disabilities

A total of 10 studies $( 1 4 . 9 \% )$ directly compared typically developing learners and those with learning disabilities (LD). Most studies $( n = 8 )$ focused on assessing a single LD while the remaining studies $( n = 2 )$ assessed the writing productivity of two groups of learners with different diagnoses: general learning difficulty $( n = 2 )$ , language difficulty $( n = 3 )$ , writing difficulty $( n = 5 )$ and reading difficulty $( n = 1 )$ . Genres varied: story narrative $( n = 6 )$ , story narrative and summary $( n = 1 )$ , informational writing $( n = 2 )$ and persuasive writing $( n = 1 )$ . The TNW data were extracted as the measure due to a lack of Cws data across the studies. Fig. 10 shows that learners with LDs all experienced sigificantly reduced word production when compared to typically developing pers (in some cases TNW was equivalent to learners 30 - 48 months younger) (Dockrell & Connelly, 2015; Mackie & Dockrel, 2004; Scott & Windsor, 2000).

There was indicative evidence that the gap between typical learners in Grade 1 and those with LD widened with age (Kim, Puranik et al., 2015). The typically-developing cohort's baseline TNW in the fall term was 20.99 words $\mathit { S D } = 1 0 . 4 8 )$ . This increased by 12.33 words in the spring term $( M = 3 3 . 3 2$ $S D = 1 3 . 7 6 \mathrm { \Omega }$ . Comparatively, the language difficulty cohort started with a lower baseline of 13.61 words $\mathit { S D } = 1 0 . 2 2$ ) in the fall term and made a smaller increase of 11.87 words by the spring term $M = 2 5 . 4 8$ $S D = 1 4 . 6 ) $

# 3. Discussion

This systematic review aimed to evaluate whether benchmarks for metrcs of written text production in elementary (primary) school could be established and to capture the extent to which these measures were associated with task- and child-based factors. Previous research has established that metrics of text production are strongly correlated with writing quality (Puranik et al., 2008), an effective tol to idnify stgging writers (Prnk et al, 208; alas et al., 2021), and are yiclly more reliable thn aesments of writing quality making them ideal for etablishing benchmarks and systematically examining changes in writing development (Pur. anik et l., 2008). To achieve this aim, we examined which measures varied across development and which task and child factors were associated with children's performance. We anticipated that more complex measures of writing productivity (CWS and T-Units) would differentiate performance at the upper ends of elementary school whil for younger children TNW would be a reliable indicator. We also expected that children with learning disabilities would produce less text at all ages. By contrast the opportunity to plan and priming of topic knowledge should improve productivity. Overall, we identified significant gaps in the evidence making the establishment f benchmarks for different measures of text production across writing tasks challenging. By contrast data comparing performance of children with learning difficulties and their peers produced robust differences.

Sixty-seven studies met the inclusionary criteria and across the studies a range of different metrics were used (see Table 2), although many of these were only used in a smallnumber of studies. The most commonly-used indicators of writing productivity were TNW and cws. To present suficient comparative data these measures were used to examine productivity for the task- and child-based factor comparisons. Overall the included studies indicated that TNW and CWS were an effctive, age-sensitive method to assess writing development with the abilit to differentiate typically-developing learners from those with diffclties. Data were reported across the elementary school range, but the focus was mainly on grades two to four and studies generall used narrative tass. More than half of the studies used tasks of $1 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ duration or less. Given the lack of data across grades for different measures and th inconsistency in task types, establishing benchmarks was not possible but task and child factors on writing productivity were eviden

Analysis of task-based factors associated with TNW and CWS was limited due to the lack of comparative data acrostasks and implementation factors. For some grades and genre, data points represented single studies and, as such, may be inluenced by dif ferences across samples adinistration and writing durations. Nonetheles the review suggest that gere was sigficantly associated with these writing metrc. verall studie rported reults for the narrative genre and while there was marked variaility at each grade it was greatest in Grade 5. This variability is of interest and, potentiall, indicates a break point for identifying struggling writers (Dockrell et al., 2019); asit is in intermediate grades when writing tasks become more complex and students can strggle (Alle et al., 2019). There was also indicative evidence of differences acrossgenre with age. Younger children produced the highest numbers of words per minute in sentence writing tass whereas for older children there was indicative evidence that narrative genres resulted in greater productivity. These data require corroboration as typicall children in the lowest grades were given sentence writing tass and there were few studies with children in the higher grades, none using sentence writing tasks. The variation across genres revealed the importance ofassessing and using normative data for each genre, rather than the generalising across genres. More data comparing the performance across genres are needed, using the same administration procedures in order for assessment, monitoring and identifi cation of learners with writing difficulty to be effective.

The data on narrative tasks aforded the analysis of the relationship between writing task duration and TNW and Cws. Overall Ionger writing times resulted in a longer total length of text but text produced in the shorter time frames (below five minutes) was similar when comparable data were available across grades (grades 2, 3, and 4). There were few differences when writing time was greater than $1 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ . By corollary shorter writing times increased fluency, measured in both TNW and CWS per minute, with higher grades showing the most marked effect. More data are needed but the current results suggest that, for these measures, i is only above Grade 4 that providing time above 15 min made adifference to production rates. The reduced production rates for TNW and CWS in the longer writing tass raises important questions about the interaction between online planning and writing productivity se for example Senechal et al., 2018). How time is assciated with writing quality remains to be examined systematically by age and task. This is particularly important given the limited data on planning, priming and text modality, and has implications for summative assessments.

Data examining TNW and CWS and child-based factors were also sparse. Five studies produced sufficient data to examine the differences by gender. The data suggested that both that irls produced more text and the gap between girls and boys widened with age. However, this remains to be corroborated with more systematic longitudinal studies which explicitly examine these differences. Children with learning disabilities also produced significantly les text than their peers without lening disabilities, but gender was not always controlled for or analysed. Given the higher numbers of boys experiencing learning disabilities (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), conclusions need to be interpreted carefully. Research on the metrics f text production of learners with LD remained sparse. However, in all included studies, those with language, learning and litercy difficulties produced less text than typicall developing peers. TNW was used consistently in the included studies and was able to diffrentiate between typically developing writers and those with disabilities (ee Weisset al., 2019 for an argument for the use of ws). One study suggested that the gap between those with LD and those without widened with age (Kim, Puranik et al., 2015) highlighting the need for early identification and suppor. dies with chldren who had identified lrning dibilities sfferd from seral limittios.irtl, the lack of diverse genres asessed; sevent percent of the included studies with children who had an LD used the story narrative genre. Research shows that narrative writing is one of the lestrctured, les ingisticall demanding tyes f witing (Ber t al., 2018) and may not provide a reliable indication of writing aility more generally (Dockrell e al., 2018). Indeed, recent recommendations emphasise the need to asses children with writing dificulties using four or five writing promptsacross genres to establish reliable indicators of writing competence (Wilson et l., 2019). There was no evidence in the current review of studies that used this approach to examine productivit. A significant omission given that battery of asessments may be a more reliable indicator of at risk writers in Grade 1 than a single measure (Ritchey & Coker, 2013). Secondly, there was often a lack of typically developing larners as control groups which make comparison across studies more challenging as writing tass differed in time, genre, and administration. Thirdly, many studies showed methodological weaknesses. During the selection proces of this systematic review, many studies that involved students with LD had to be excluded due to small sample sizes and/or insufficient descriptions of the assessment procedures.

# 4. Limitations

To our knowledge this i the first systematic review to examine metrics of written text production in elementary school and the factors that are asociated with children's performance. However, as with any systematic review inclusion and exclusion criteria influence the results. A significant limitation was the lack of data to test our key research questions and interrogate the fullrange of possible measures (e.g., CIWS se Romig et al., 2017 who examined criterion validity of CBMs) and to produce a meta-analysis addressing questions related to development of writing productivity and the fctors impacting on development The inclusion research papers published in English, with monolingual children, where most of the included studies were undertaken inthe Unite States limits generalisability to the global community of learners and our understanding of writing productivity across ifferent orthographies see Dockrell & Connelly, 2021) and different pedagogical approaches. There i a growing literature that highlights the importance of the ways in which writing is taught and it was not possible to capture the influence of pedagogy on productivity. The exclusion of studies with three or fewer participants resulted in the exclusion of some single-subject design studie focusing specificall on LD and there is scope for further reviews which capture these studies. A final limitation was the absence of alternative modalities for written text production in the Boolean search terms, which may have led to fewer mixed-modality studies being identified.

# 5. Conclusion

Reliable and valid measures of the assessment of written text underpin evidence based teaching and the identificatio of truggling writers. The review identified sufficient studies to support the use of TW and CWS as quick, ffetie, valid and reliable asesments of written expression for children at elementary school. However, there were insuficient studies to provide rliable developmental benchmarks aross writing tass and writing formats and data for other metrics were sparse. Future studies need to establish del. opmental trends across genres, tasks, writing durations and populations to establish normative benchmarks. To date there has been littleattempt to exaine the eect f planing r piing f topic kowledge despit its use  lasroms. o use writig productivity as a guide for pedagogy, in assessment protocos and in the identification f struggling writers across the elementary schoo studies need to capture child- and task-related factors in a reliable and consistent fashion and toconsider systematically a wider range of metrics in the evaluation of children's writing products.
