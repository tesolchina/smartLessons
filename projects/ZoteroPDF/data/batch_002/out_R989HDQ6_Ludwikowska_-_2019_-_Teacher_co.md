# Abstract

Purpose – Teachers at the tertiary level play an essential role in the expansion of quality in higher education. The issue of competence and its development has particular importance in creating the new landscape of the twenty-first century. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to develop validated inventory identifying future-oriented competences required for the teaching profession in the changing environment of higher education institutions (HEIs).

Design/methodology/approach – In the study, teacher competences and related teacher’s behavior were theoretically defined and underwent principal factor analysis. The survey was carried out among teachers, students and graduates of HEIs in India.

Findings – The analysis revealed future-oriented teacher competences resulting from the globalization process of the teaching profession. Testing the inventory indicated that there was a high Cronbach’s $\alpha$ reliability. Results show that the inventory enjoyed proper internal consistency for four dimensions as general teaching competences. The inventory with 66 items and four factors explained 47.279 percent of the total variance and indicated a strong factor model.

Practical implications – Teacher competence inventory (TCI) can be used to modernize study programs of teacher education and shift focus toward future-oriented competences required for the teaching profession in HEIs in India. Therefore, TCI could be essential to prepare teachers for the changing environment of teaching.

Originality/value – This study is an essential step in reorienting the process of teacher education toward professional development aimed at developing future-oriented competences in the teaching profession. It proposes to develop an instrument measuring teacher competences areas and related teacher behavior.

# Introduction

Teachers play an important role in equipping students with the knowledge and skills essential for their future. Teachers are expected to be competent professionals to enhance students’ growth. However, living in the globalized world results in growing demands for the teaching profession. Nowadays mobility occurs on a global scale (Goodwin, 2010; Robson, 2011). Students can expect to study alongside with colleagues from different cultural backgrounds. Increasing the range of international activities leads to transformational institutional changes (Robson, 2011). Approaches to students are becoming more global and student-centered, which demands different competences for teachers (Tigelaar et al., 2004; Yong Zhao, 2010; Loughran, 2014). All of these factors have led to far-reaching contextual changes, including an increasingly diverse population of students with challenging learning needs and aspirations (Yong Zhao, 2010; Goodwin, 2010). In that context, higher education became a sector where teaching and learning will face significant changes in the next decades. Teacher education is regarded as a critical target of educational reform (Kleickmann et al., 2012; Sykes et al., 2010).

Determining the conditions of effective and efficient teacher operation should be associated with the notion of competence. Therefore, the issue of competence and competence development has special importance. It refers to the assessment of the extent to which employees “[…] can use their knowledge, skills and personality traits to achieve the goals and standards assigned to their roles […]” (Armstrong, 2001). Teacher competences should enable them to respond to society’s expectations, complex challenges and demands of the globalized world.

Global changes in the academic environment are making the traditional approach to teacher education in developing countries, such as India, obsolete. Indian higher education institutions (HEIs) face many challenges regarding low quality of teaching and learning resulting from lack of pedagogical trainings for teachers, limited understanding of the learning process and use of outdated pedagogies (input-oriented, lecture-based approach), lack of accountability, quality assurance and separation of research and teaching. Therefore, teacher development is considered crucial for the future of the quality of higher education in India (Planning Commission (Government of India), 2012-2017). The role of the teacher needs to be changed from an information provider to learning facilitators.

Changes brought by globalization are becoming the most powerful force that will shape the future world. The changes have implications for the type of teacher development needed for this new environment (Yong Zhao, 2010). Existing studies concerning teacher education capture the need to prepare teachers for twenty-first-century competences. However, it seems that the results are not conclusive in terms of which competences would be most important. Although researchers indicate many pedagogical competences for teachers, there is little attention on future-oriented competences required in the changing educational environment. Moreover, existing global frameworks of teaching competences are not validated. They do not differentiate teacher profiles, they are traditional, teacher-centered, focused on teacher behavior and consequently not adjusted to contemporary teaching approaches (Tigelaar et al., 2004).

These inconsistencies mean that it seems necessary to indicate factors that will shape teacher education in the future. Therefore, this study attempts to design and validate an Indian context inventory that focuses on future-oriented teacher competences from the perspective of a teacher, student and graduate, by computing its reliability and validity. The study results in developing reliable and valid inventory consisted of defined future-oriented competences required for the teaching profession in Indian HEIs. Moreover, Teacher competence inventory (TCI) might also be helpful to prepare teachers for the changing environment of teaching in terms of developing required future-oriented competences. Recommendations to develop a plan for identifying and measuring teacher competences areas and related teacher behavior have been described.

University policymakers and curriculum planners can use TCI to design curricula for future study programs and training courses for teachers to address competences required in the future teaching environment. It can also be useful for teachers to set their professional learning goals. TCI might be helpful for researchers to employ it in their future studies. Complementary studies on TCI might be focused on investigating the validity and reliability of the TCI as an evaluation tool to measure the level of competences among teachers.

To investigate these assumptions, the author posed following research question:

RQ1. Which competences are important for the future-oriented teacher in HEIs?

The potential application of this inventory in designing teacher education programs and the factors that limit its applicability are discussed.

# Literature review

Recent theories on teaching reveal teaching as a complex activity differentiated by assignments, subjects, specializations and shaped by the teaching context (Sykes et al., 2010; Blömeke et al., 2015). When teaching context is changing, teaching competences must be viewed in the light of the various circumstances in which teaching takes place. The changing academic environment, vision on student learning and teaching role require teachers to continuous development (Darling-Hammond, 2017). Hence, a shift toward the expected change in the behaviors of teachers in the world over is needed.

The author began by analyzing past empirical and theoretical studies (selection protocol yielded articles published in 2001–2017) to identify existing frameworks of teaching competences. These studies have concentrated on examining research on future-oriented teacher competences, and research on validation of existing frameworks.

There is a growing interest in the issue of the professional development of teachers (Loughran, 2014). Teacher development is defined as teachers’ construction of teaching competences in terms of their professional knowledge. It involves advanced learning content, learning about the pedagogy, knowledge about curriculum development, assessment, purposes for teaching, research (Evens et al., 2018). It requires skills to create new knowledge, shift in focus from curriculum to learner, creating a supportive environment and meaningful relationships with learners (Loughran, 2014). Teacher’s knowledge plays a vital role in student learning for their growth; therefore, teachers need to be able to transform knowledge into practice (Evens et al., 2018). These principles demand from teachers the involvement, capacity and willingness to examine their own identity, convictions and beliefs (Avalos, 2011; Loughran, 2014). Understanding these principles, knowing their meaning and using them in practice points to a complex nature of teacher development itself. It requires changes in thinking about teacher education in terms of the long-term staff development process.

To explain the comprehensive nature of teacher development and conditions of effective employee operations, this study employs the notion of competence. It primarily refers to the assessment of the extent to which employees “[…] can use their knowledge, skills, and personality traits to achieve the goals and standards assigned to their roles […]” (Armstrong, 2001, s. 241). Such a composition of knowledge, skills and personal characteristics is required for practical task realization on a particular job position. Competence is defined as a set of skills and behavioral patterns that underline successful performances. It is proven the ability to use knowledge and skills to do something successfully (Blašková et al., 2014; Koenen et al., 2015).

Shavelson (2010) explained competence as a complex range of abilities that change throughout new goals and task performance. In the field of Vocational Education and Training competence is defined in terms of knowledge, skills and attitudes (Oser, 2013). The term competence is commonly defined as a composition of knowledge, skills, and personal characteristics and refers to the competence profile required for the effective task realization on a job position. It allows for the effective realization of tasks and effective achievement of goals in a given position in the context of the strategic goals of the organization.

Many scholars have pursued an approach to defining competences in terms of personal characteristics. Blömeke et al. (2015) view competence as a continuum from traits to observed behaviors in real-world situations. Spencer and Spencer (1993) also argued that competence is a part of a person’s personality, which predicts behavior and performance. Jinga and Istrate (2001) define competence in terms of cognitive, affective, motivational and managerial skills, which interacts with the teacher’s personality traits. Hartig et al. (2008) outlined competences as a compound ability construct related to performance in real-life situations. It stresses that competence is divided into traits, each to be measured reliably and validly (Blömeke et al., 2015). Tigelaar et al. (2004) define teaching competences as an integrated set of personal characteristics, knowledge, skills, attitudes aimed to achieve effective performance. The definition also highlight that teaching competences must be viewed in various teaching contexts. Kim et al. (2017) are of the view that teacher competences reflect the capacity to deal with some task or challenge. Koenen et al. (2015) highlight that this capability becomes visible by exposing successful behavior in different contexts.

The issue of competence and management of this category is also of special importance in HEIs. Numerous authors deal with the definition of desirable and undesirable competences of teachers, several frameworks for teaching competences have already been defined for the higher education sector. Jinga and Istrate (2001) identified three teaching competences materialized through a number of capacities: professional competence, pedagogical competence, and psychosocial and managerial competence. Zimpher and Howey (1987) described four major types of teacher competences for teacher education: clinical competence (i.e. problem solving through reflecting actions and inquiry as in clinical supervision); personal competence (understanding of self from multiple perspectives to improve classroom instruction, such as increasing self-awareness, formation of identity, clarification of values); critical competence (teacher acts as an agent of change); and technical competence (i.e. what is to be learnt and how in terms of methods of instructions, and criteria to measure success). Based on this study, Zohre and Negin (2018) also proposed four competences, including clinical, technical, personal and critical, each from three perspectives: of a student, department and learning. Tigelaar et al. (2004) constructed framework focused on teacher: the person as teacher (focus on personal characteristics needed to become a good teacher), the teacher as expert on content knowledge (using knowledge to stimulate student learning), the teacher as facilitator of learning processes (includes designing educational materials, providing students advice, feedback, evaluation) the teacher as organizer (collaborating with colleagues, organizing work) and the teacher as scholar/lifelong learner (focus on teacher development). A comprehensive picture of teacher competences was also drawn by Kaendler et al. (2015). They outlined collaborative learning in fostering student interaction: plan and consolidate students’ interaction, monitor, support and reflect upon this interaction. Hiebert et al. (2007) composed the framework of skills applied in daily teaching activities which constitutes relationships between teaching and learning in the classroom. The authors’ interest lies in defining competences on how to teach and become an effective teacher over time. Goodwin (2010) developed integrated, inquiry-based, holistic teaching approach with five knowledge domains: personal (beliefs about teaching), contextual (understanding classroom situations, environment, society), pedagogical (content, theories and methods of teaching for curriculum development and quality teaching), sociological (respecting diversity, confront fears, prejudices to teach all races and ethnicities), and social (participate in group process, leadership skills) knowledge. All the domains support teaching in a global context. Wahlgren et al. (2016) employed a survey to identify teachers’ relational competence: giving appreciative feedback, rewarding active participation in class, encouraging students for development and improvement, individual approach to students, creating networks and social interaction with students, coping with conflicts.

The literature review revealed that most frameworks of teaching competences emphasize pedagogical competences (Kleickmann et al., 2012; Goodwin, 2010), content knowledge (Hiebert et al., 2007; Kleickmann et al., 2012; Tigelaar et al., 2004; Evens et al., 2018), organizational competencies (Tigelaar et al., 2004), research-oriented competences (Loughran, 2014), diversity management (Goodwin, 2010). All these competences are applicable while teaching the different professions of students; nevertheless, teaching methods should be adjusted to the subject.

Although researchers indicate many teacher competences, there is little attention on future-oriented competences required in the changing educational environment. Existing frameworks of teaching competences are not validated and not adjusted to modern approaches of teaching (Tigelaar et al., 2004).

# Research methodology

The research was conducted in late 2017 in India, where higher education is one of the largest in the world with over 35m students, 800 universities and 41,000 colleges. Massification of students and institutions is one of the reasons for lowering the quality of Indian higher education; hence, higher education requires reforms to meet various demands (Altbach, 2014).

A significant need for raising the quality of Indian higher education has been established by an Act of Parliament of the National Council for Teacher Education in 1993 aimed at development of teacher education in India. It brought a shift in approach and put forward commitment, performance and competence as principles for teacher education (Rajput and Walia, 2001). The education sector in India is poised to witness further significant growth as India will have the world’s largest tertiary-age population and second-largest graduate talent pipeline globally by the end of 2020. The Government of India also launched initiatives to attract international students and teachers to India to bring diversity to Indian classrooms.

To answer the challenges of Indian higher education, this study aimed at identifying future competences that would be required in teacher education in the changing academic environment. To this end, 71 items describing teacher competences and related teacher behavior were theoretically defined. Based on these competences, a survey was conducted and applied to Indian teachers, students and graduates.

# Participants

The survey was conducted among the group of 221 respondents: 136 students (62.1 percent), 35 graduates (16 percent), 18 academic teachers (8.2 percent). Many invitations to study were not received. Nevertheless, the sample can be considered as representative because it is sufficiently diversified to be a basis for overall conclusions concerning the given topic.

In this study, a random sampling strategy of determining participants was adopted to maximize the sample size. The students and teachers of the author’s contacts network from different universities of India were invited to complete the survey. The universities were selected based on their involvement in international practices, such as exchange programs or lectures with international teachers. A total of 62.6 percent of the sample reported that they had at their university lectures with a teacher from abroad, 39.7 percent also reported they had already undertaken study courses abroad. It gives a valuable perspective on what global teaching competences are required in higher education.

The educational level of 13.7 percent participants $( N = 3 0 )$ was “other.” Majority of respondents were male $( N { = } 1 3 6$ ; 62.1 percent), 83 female (37.9 percent) contributed to the study. More than half $( N { = } 1 1 0 ; 5 0 . 2$ percent) reported current position at postgraduate level, 84 (38.4 percent) reported being at undergraduate level. A total of 21 (9.6 percent) were “PhD,” and 4 (1.8 percent) were professors.

These participants represented an array of content areas (“Faculty/Branch you study/ graduate/ teach”) including “engineering” $( N { = } 9 6$ ; 43.8 percent), “management studies” $( N = 5 1$ ; 23.3 percent), “humanity” $( N = 2 3$ ; 10.5 percent), “social sciences” $( N = 2 3$ ; 10.5 percent), “art” $N { = } 1 3$ ; 5.9 percent), and other respondents chose answer “other” $( N { = } 1 3$ ; 5.9 percent).

Participants in the study were requested to fill out a self-reflected survey available on-line. Along with the self-reflections survey provided data for quantitative analysis.

# Instrument and methodology used to develop the survey instrument

Considering the comprehensive nature of the research, the main survey was preceded by the pilot survey conducted in early 2017 among students. The pilot study aimed to identify teacher roles in HEIs from student perception and data from Indian Government Ministry acts. Obtained results provided thoughts on directions for the improvement of the field of teacher education in the context of conceptualized roles (Ludwikowska, 2018).

Phase 1 aimed to analyze the required qualifications of teachers, their responsibilities, functions and tasks. The results of the analysis referred to the document “UGC Regulations on Minimum Qualifications for Appointment of Teachers and other Academic Staff in Universities and Colleges and Measures for the Maintenance of Standards in Higher Education” (University Grant Commission, 2010). Based on these regulations teacher’s roles, such as: instructional, self-developmental, institutional, collaborative, relational and social, have been conceptualized.

Phase 2 of the study aimed to explore the expectations toward the character of teacher work and future-oriented roles from the students’ perspective. For this purpose, the survey with open-ended questions was developed based on the literature review and analysis of the UGC regulations. The questions concerned the following areas: creating a learning environment, teaching methods, skills required for teaching, leadership tasks, personality traits required in the teaching profession. Each of the roles requires specific skills, competences. Therefore, recommendation indicated for further research focused on the perception of teachers’ roles and comparative analysis from the perspective of a different group, such as teachers, students, employed graduates (Ludwikowska, 2018). The current study replied for this recommendation.

Development of the main survey was preceded by a literature review, which included:

existing frameworks of teaching competences; research on future-oriented teacher competences; and research on validation of existing frameworks.

A summary of the findings of the literature review is provided in the research context section.

Based on the literature review and pilot study a list of topics needed for the survey with areas of teacher competences was initially listed: support learners, learning environment, teaching methods, modern teaching style, effective teacher leader, multicultural competences, preparing for future changes in the teaching profession. A weakness of existing frameworks is that they do not emphasize teachers’ personality (Tigelaar et al., 2004). Therefore, developed inventory also included the assessment of important personal characteristics of the teacher. The scope of each area of teaching competences was carefully studied in order to identify unique characteristics of each group and compile the items for TCI. A first draft of the survey instrument has been developed. Bias in questions was minimized by using experts from the Psychology Department at one university in India. A revised second draft of the survey included comments provided by experts. The designed TCI had 71 items rated on the five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 – Unimportant, 2 – Somewhat Important, 3 – Quite Important, 4 – Very Important and 5 – Extremely Important. To investigate whether the TCI was effective in detecting future-oriented teacher competences in tracking competence developments, the respondents were asked: “How important are the following teaching competences for the future-oriented teacher in HEIs?”

# Procedure

As a first step in a research process, factor analysis was carried out to reduce the multidimensional space of questions to a smaller number of dimensions. It aimed to identify difficult or confusing questions, unclear terminology and to assess whether respondents interpreted the questions as intended. For this purpose, the primary component method with factor varimax normalized rotation was applied. For the selected scales, their reliability was detected by calculating Cronbach’s $\alpha$ coefficient. Based on the $N$ (0; 1) distribution, standardization was made to the $Z$ scale, and normalization intervals (sten scale) were calculated. The selected dimensions were calculated based on averaged scales. The overall score was calculated as the sum of the scales selected.

# Results and discussion

The study aimed to design and validate a teacher inventory called the TCI by computing its reliability and validity to enable researchers to employ it in their future studies on required teacher competences.

In the first part of the statistical study, factor analysis was performed to reduce questions and isolate dimensions from the space of many questions about similar response tendencies. Factor analysis derived an orderly simplification of the items to a small number of representative constructs or factors reflecting student response patterns. Next, a scree plot was made, and the eigenvalues were calculated to assess the number of factors (Figure 1). Based on the scree plot, even though many factors have an eigenvalue $> 1$ , after the fourth factor, the variables that have already been determined do not bring any significant variability. Therefore, finally, four factors were decided. Results shown in Table I indicate eigenvalues and the percentage range of explained variance by these factors.

The above table provokes the conclusion that factor 1 is the strongest, which explains 34.459 percent of the total variance. In general, four factors explain 47.279 percent of the total variance. The rest percentage is other factors not included in the work, the result $> 4 0$ percent is high and indicates a strong factor model. In the next step, the factor load matrix was calculated to assign individual questions to a given factor (Table II). Class load value factorial $> 0 . 4$ was assumed.

Questions 5, 10, 37 and 69 were removed from the survey because they did not make a significant contribution to any of the identified factors. The italic font indicates the questions classified to the given factor.

Next, the reliability of the distinguished factors was verified by calculating the reliability of Cronbach’s $\alpha$ coefficient (Table III). The factors were named depending on the subject of the questions.

It is worth underlining that for the selected factors and the total sum result, the reliability is $> 0 . 7 .$ . Hence, the model of distinguished factors is reliable and indicates a high internal reliability of the scales and measurements.

For the determined dimensions, initial normalization was performed. For this purpose, the $Z$ scales were calculated using the normal distribution $N ( 0 ; 1 )$ :

$$
\forall x _ { i } \in X \quad Z = \frac { x _ { i } - \overline { { x } } } { \delta } ,
$$

where $i$ is the another measuring point, i.e., the result of the next examined person; $x _ { i }$ the raw result obtained in the original measuring scale; $\overline { { x } }$ the average value of the scale, $\delta$ the standard deviation of the scale.

After determining the scale $Z ,$ for each dimension and each point of measurement, the sten scores were calculated according to the formula:

$$
S = \overline { { x } } - 0 , 5 + \delta \cdot Z .
$$

This study was an attempt to design an inventory named TCI to identify future-oriented competences in the teaching profession. The factor analysis was run to reduce the number of variables into fewer numbers of factors and to probe the underlying constructs of the 71 items of the TCI inventory. There was high Cronbach’s $\alpha$ reliability for each dimension, which implies that the inventory enjoyed proper internal consistency. The resulting inventory was reliable and valid with 66 items on four dimensions as general teaching competences. Four factors explain 47.279 percent of the total variance, the result $> 4 0$ percent is high and indicates a strong factor model.

Four items of the first competence, “stimulating students for their achievement,” reflect teachers’ ability to create students’ willingness to different ways of involvement. This requires assessment skills aimed to improve students’ achievement. There are evidences in the literature that learning opportunities created by teachers affect students’ motivation (Kleickmann et al., 2012). Sample items are as follows:

knowledgeable, teaches what is inside the book and as well as outside it; creates a learning environment that allows for alternative styles of learning, new and different ways of involvement of students; and systematically collects and interprets assessment results from multiple assessments to monitor, improve, and report individual and group achievement.

The other competence, named “using different teaching approaches to improve student learning,” includes 24 items that characterize a teacher’s ability to apply teaching approach supporting effective learning by students. There have been fewer studies of teachers approaches to teaching (Kember and Kwan, 2002). Trigwell and Prosser (1996) characterized five teaching approaches as a combination of intention and strategy. Kember and Kwan (2002) also distinguished motivation and strategy as two dimensions of teaching approaches. Authors indicated a content-centered and learning-centered teaching approach that concentrates upon the students to ensure that appropriate learning is taking place. This conception is also labeled as “student-centered teaching” (Tigelaar et al., 2004). The items of “using different teaching approaches to improve student learning” competence indicate teacher’s ability to encourage students to think forward, to express and discuss viewpoints openly with a diverse audience, to develop a passion for learning. The teacher applies interactive and teaching methods using multiple perspectives and interdisciplinary knowledge relevant to a diverse changing world (Koenen et al., 2015). Teaching approach influences the approach to study adopted by the student, hence affects the quality of the learning outcomes (Kember and Kwan, 2002; Hiebert et al., 2007). Sample items are as follows:

encourages students to move forward, think creatively and out of the box; creates an environment where students can express their viewpoints openly, encourages them to share various opinions and in the classroom; and provides students with timely, helpful and accurate feedback on their performance and progress toward achievement goals.

The other competence “preparing students to be globally competent” includes 16 items that epitomize teacher’s ability to develop students’ worldview to participate effectively in changing world, equip them with appreciations of different cultures, and their own cultural identity. The Ludwikowska (2017) study revealed five different multicultural competences for teachers: understanding and respecting diversity, awareness of own biases and prejudices, awareness of other cultures, openness, acceptance of different ideas and views, adjusting teaching style to students from different backgrounds. Cross-cultural communication became a global competence, which increased the intensity of understanding and interacting with people from different cultures and countries (Yong Zhao, 2010; Robson, 2011). It requires globally competent teachers who have knowledge of international dimensions and incorporates cultural context in learning, skills to teach students from around the world, appreciate multiple points of view, broads their own cultural competence (Yong Zhao, 2010; Bates, 2010). With this competence teachers can inspire and motivate students to think and grow globally, to guide them and prepare for global competitiveness. Sample items are as follows:

gives exposure to students on what methods are followed in other countries; can adjust to different cultural settings; and   
inspires students to think deeply about global issues.

The last competence, “creating a supportive learning environment,” consist of 22 items reflecting teacher’s ability to provide students with a safe and supportive classroom environment that facilitates active participation and engagement of all students. It requires the ability to recognize and understand individual needs, to listen and do not misinterpret students’ opinions. This will be enhanced by having a set of individual characteristics: being empathic, sensitive, patient, optimistic and pleasant. A teacher needs to be self-disciplined, well organized and chose leadership style according to the situation in the classroom. The study of Sedova et al. (2016) shows that implementing classroom discourse engages students’ autonomy and effective learning. To establish an open and supportive environment, teachers are required to adopt a facilitator role. Supporting role has significant meaning, therefore, should be trained in teacher education (Kaendler et al., 2015; Wahlgren et al., 2016; Sedova et al., 2016). Sample items are as follows:

understands students and their perspectives; shows patience to students of different learning speed, is responsive to student questions without negatively acting on annoyance or anger; and confident of knowledge of the learnt material as well as confident in teaching acumen.

# Conclusions

This study aimed at designing a TCI to identify future-oriented teaching competences required for teacher education in the changing academic environment. The literature review revealed many teacher competences framework; nevertheless, there is little attention on future-oriented competences with focus on changing educational environment. Furthermore, analyzed frameworks of teaching competences are not validated and not consider modern approaches of teaching resulting from the globalization process in the teaching profession.

The items of the TCI pertained to four dimensions, named teacher competences: stimulating students for their achievement, using different teaching approaches to improve student learning, preparing students to be globally competent, creating a supportive learning environment. The items for each competence were identified theoretically through literature review and operationally through the results of qualitative author’s research on students’ perception of competences for academic teachers in India (Ludwikowska, 2017). Data address teaching competences needed by higher education in the coming decades. TCI allows teachers to adjust their teaching to a changing environment. The items for each competence indicate specific behavior to be followed to achieve the required teaching quality. Hence, the study revealed the necessary key competences of teachers as professionals and change agents for learners in the changing university environment.

The results of reliability analysis indicated that inventory enjoys internal consistency; therefore, might be used as a tool to structure teacher education. The results of the study are of great significance for future teacher development. The study opens opportunities for the developers of teacher education study programs to consider a shift toward a focus on developing identified in the study future-oriented competences required for the teaching profession in Indian HEIs. This is an essential step to structure teacher education to help teachers to develop an understanding of challenges to be faced in education in the globalized world.

The inventory can be used in educational contexts across India because respondents represented different states of India. However, performed empirical study is burdened with certain limitation. TCI does not measure the certain level of competences. Therefore, future research can implement TCI to evaluate teacher competences. It seems to be a solid first step underlining the need for further analysis of the given subject. Complementary studies on TCI might focus on investigating the validity and reliability of the TCI as a tool to measure the level of competencies among teachers.
