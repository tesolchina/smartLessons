# Preface by Halliday

Foreign Language Teaching & Research Press is to be congratulated on its initiative in making these publications in linguistics available to foreign language teachers and postgraduate students of linguistics in China.

The books are a representative selection of up-to-date writings on the most important branches of linguistic studies, by scholars who are recognized as leading authorities in their fields.

The availability of such a broad range of materials in linguistics will greatly help individual teachers and students to build up their own knowledge and understanding of the subject. At the same time, it will also contribute to the development of linguistics as a discipline in Chinese universities and colleges, helping to overcome the divisions into "English linguistics". "Chinese linguistics" and so on which hinder the progress of linguistics as a unified science.

The series is to be highly commended for what it offers to all those wanting to gain insight into the nature of language. whether from a theoretical point of view or in application to their professional activities as Ianguage teachers. It is being launched at a time when there are increasing opportunities in China for pursuing linguistic studies, and I am confident that it will succeed in meeting these new requirements.

# Preface by Chomsky

It is about half a century since the study of language undertook a rather new course, while renewing some traditional concerns that had long been neglected. The central change was a shift of attention from behavior and the products of behavior (texts, corpora, etc.) to the internal mechanisms that enter into behavior. This was part of a general shift of perspective in psychology towards what became known as "cognitive science," and was in fact a significant factor in contributing to this development.

With this departure from prevailing structuralist and behaviorist approaches, the object of inquiry becomes a property of individual persons, my granddaughters for example. We ask what special properties they have that underlie an obvious but nonetheless remarkable fact. Exposed to a world of "huzzing, booming confusion" (in William James's classic phrase), each instantly identified some intricate subpart of it as linguistic, and reflexively, without awareness or instruction (which would be useless in any event), performed analytic operations that led to knowledge of some specific linguistic system, in onc case, a variety of what is called informally "English," in another a variety of "Spanish." It could just as easily been one of the Chinese languages, or an ahoriginal language of Australia, or some other human language. Exposed to the same environment, their pet cats (or chimpanzees, etc.) would not even take the first step of identifying the relevant category of phenomena, just as humans do not identify what a bee perceives as the waggle dance that communicates the distance and orientation of a source of honey.

All organisms have special subsystems that lead them to deal with their environment in specific ways. Some of these subsystems are called "mental" or "cognitive," informal designations that need not be made precise, just as there is no need to determine exactly where chemistry ends and biology begins. The development of cognitive systems, like others, is influenced by the environment, but the general course is genetically determined. Changes of nutrition, for example, can have a dramatic effect on development, but will not change a human embryo to a bee or a mouse, and the same holds for cognitive development. The evidence is strong that among the human cognitive systems is a "faculty of language" (FL), to borrow a traditional term: some subsystem of (mostly) the brain. The evidence is also overwhelming that apart from severe pathology, FL is close to uniform for humans: it is a genuine species property. The "initial state" of FL is determined hy the common human genetic endowment. Exposed to experience, FL passes through a series of states, normally reaching a relatively stable state at about puberty, after which changes are peripheral: growth of vocabulary, primarily.

As far as we know, every aspect of language - sound, structure, meanings of words and more complex expressions  is narrowly restricted by the properties of the initial state; these same restrictions underlie and account for the extraordinary richness and flexibility of the systems that emerge. It is a virtual truism that scope and limits are intimately related. The biological endowment that allows an embryo to become a mouse. with only the most meager environmental "information," prevents it from becoming a fly or a monkey. The same must be true of human higher mental faculties, assuming that humans are part of the biological world, not angels.

We can think of tbe states attained by FL., including the stable states, as "languages": in more technical terminology, we may call them "internalized languages" (I-languages). Having an I-language, a person is equipped to engage in the "creative use of language" that has traditionally been considered a primary indication of possession of mind; by Descartes and his followers, to cite the most famous case. The person can produce new expressions over an unbounded range, expressions that are appropriate to circumstances and situations but not caused by them, and that evoke thoughts in others that they might have expressed in similar ways. The nature of these abilities remains as obscure and puzzling to us as it was to the Cartesians, but with the shift of perspective to \*internalist linguistics," a great deal has been learned about the cognitive structures and operations that enter into these remarkable capacities.

Though the observation does not bear directly on the study of human language, it is nevertheless of interest that FL appears to be biologically isolated in critical respects, hence a species property in a stronger sense than just being a common human possession. To mention only the most obvious respect, an I-language is a system of discrete infinity, a generative process that yields an unbounded range of expressions, each with a definite sound and meaning. Systems of discrete infinity are rare in the biological world and unknown in non-human communication systems. When we look beyond the most elementary properties of human language, its apperently unique features become even more pronounced. In fundamental respects human language does not fall within thc standard typologies of animal communication systcms, and there is little reason to speculate that it evolved from them, or even that it should be regarded as baving the "primary function" of communication (a rather obscure notion at best). Language can surely be used for communication, as can anything people do, but it is not unreasonable to adopt the traditional view that language is primarily an instrument for expression of thought, to others or to oneself; statistically speaking, use of language is overwhelmingly internal, as can casily be determined by introspection.

Viewed in the internalist perspective, the study of language is part of biology, taking its place alongside the study of the visual system, the "dance faculty" and navigational capacities of bees, the circulatory and digestive systems, and other properties of organisms. Such systems can be studied at various levels. In the case of cognitive systems, these are sometimes called the "psychological" and "physiological" levels --- again, terms of convenience only. A bee scientist may try to determine and characterize the computations carried out by the bee's nervous system when it transmits or receives information about a distant flower, or when it finds its way back to the nest: that is the level of "psychological" analysis, in conventional terminology. Or one may try to find the neural basis for these computational capacities, a topic about which very little is known even for the simplest organisms: the level of "physiologica!" analysis. These are mutually supportive enterprises. What is learned at the "psychological ievel" commonly provides guidelines for the inquiry into neural mechanisms; and reciprocally, insights into neural mechanisms can inform the psychological inquiries that seek to reveal the properties of the organism in different terms.

In a similar way, the study of chemical reactions and properties, and of the structured entities postulated to account for thern, provided guidelines for fundamental physics, and helped prepare the way for the eventual unification of the disciplines. 75 years ago, Bertrand Russell, who knew the sciences weli, observed that "chemical laws cannot at present be reduced to physical laws." His statement was correct, but as it turned out, misleading; they could not be reduced to physical laws in principle, as physics was then understood. Unification did come about a few years later, but only after the quantum theoretic revolution had provided a radically changed physics that could be unified with a virtually unchanged chemistry. That is by no means an unusual episode in the history of science. We have no idea what the outcome may be of today's efforts to unify the psychological and physiological levels of scientific inquiry into cognitive capacities of organisms, human language included.

It is useful to bear in mind some important lessons of the recent unification of chemistry and physics, remembering that this is core hard science, dealing with the simplest and most elementary structures of the world, not studies at the outer reaches of understanding that deal with entities of extraordinary complexity. Prior to unification, it was common for leading scientists to regard the principles and postulated entities of chemistry as mere calculating devices, useful for predicting phenomena but lacking some mysterious property called "physical reality." A century ago, atoms and nolecules were regarded the same way by distinguished scientists. People believe in the molecular theory of gases only because they are familiar with the game of billiards, Poincare observed mockingly. Ludwig Boltzmann died in despair a century ago, feeling unable to convince his fellow-physicists of the physical reality of the atomic theory of which he was one of the founders. It is now understood that all of this was gross error. Boltzmann's atoms, Kekule's structured organic molecules, and other postulated entities were real in the only sense of the term we know: they had a crucial place in the best explanations of phenomena that the human mind could contrive.

The lessons carry over to the study of cognitive capacities and structures: theories of insect navigation, or perception of rigid objects in motion, or I-language, and so on. One seeks the best explanations, looking forward to eventual unification with accounts that are formulated in different terms, but without foreknowledge of the form such unification might take. or even if it is a goal that can be achieved by human intelligence - after all, a specific biological systcm, not a universal instrument.

Within this "biolinguistic" perspective, the core problem is the study of particular I-languages, including the initial state from which they derive. A thesis that might be entertained is that this inquiry is privileged in that it is presupposed, if only tacitly, in every other approach to language: sociolinguistic, comparative, literary, etc. That seems reasonable, in fact almost inescapable; and a close examination of actual work will show, I think, that the thesis is adopted even when that is vociferously denied. At the very least it seems hard to deny a weaker thesis: that the study of linguistic capacities of persons should find a fundamental place in any serious investigation of other aspects of language and its use and functions. Just as human biology is a core part of anthropology, history, the arts, and in fact any aspect of human life, so the biolinguistic approach helongs to the social sciences and humanities as well as human biology.

Again adapting traditional terms to a new context, the theory of an Ilanguage L is sometimes called its \*grammar," and the theory of the initial state S-0 of FL is called "universal grammar"(UG). The general study is often called "generative grammar" because a grammar is concerned with the ways in which L generates an infinite array of expressions. The experience relevant to the transition from S-0 to L is called "primary linguistic data" (PLD). A grammar G of the I-language L is said to satisfy the condition of "descriptive adequacy" to the extent that it is a true theory of L. UG is said to satisfy the condition of "explanatory adequacy" to the extent that it is a true theory of the initial state. The terminology was chosen to bring out the fact that UG can provide a deeper explanation of Iinguistic phenomena than G. G offers an account of the phenomena hy describing the generative procedure that yields them; UG seeks to show how this generative procedure, hence the phenomena it yields, derive from PLD: We may think of S-0 as a mapping of PLD to L, and of UG as a theory of this operation; this idealized picture is sometimes said to constitute "the logical problem of language acquisition." The study of $^ { \star }$ language use investigates how the resources of I-language are employed to express thought, to talk about the world, to communicate information, to establish social relations, and so on. In principle, this study might seek to investigate the "creative aspect of language use," but as noted, that topic seems shrouded in mystery, like much of the rest of the nature of action.

The biolinguistic iurn of the 1950s resurrected many traditional questions, but was able to approach them in new ways, with the help of intellectual tools that had not previously been available: in particular, a clear understanding of the nature of recursive processes, generative procedures that can characterize an infinity of objects (in this case, expressions of L) with finite means (the mechanisms of L). As soon as the inquiry was seriously undertaken. it was discovered that traditional grammars and dictionaries, no matter how rich and detailed, did not address central questions about linguistic expressions. They basically provide \*hints" that can be used by someone equipped with FL and some of its states, but leave the nature of these systems unexamined. Very quickly, vast ranges of new phenomena were discovered, along with new problems, and sometimes at least partial answers.

It was recognized very soon that there is a serious tension between tbe search for descriptive and for explanatory adequacy. The former appears to lead to very intricate rule systems, varying among languages and among constructions of a particular language. But this cannot be correct, since each language is attained with a common FL on the basis of PLD providing little information about these rules and constructions.

The dilemma led to efforts to discover general properties of rule systems that can be extracted from particular grammars and attributed to UG, leaving a residue simple enough to be attainable on the basis of PLD. About 25 years ago, these efforts converged in the so-called "principles and parameters" (P&P) approach, which was a radical break from traditional ways of looking at language. The P&P approach dispenses with the rules and constructions that constituted the framework for traditional grammar, and were taken over, pretty much, in early generative grammar. The relative clauses of Hungarian and verb phrases of Japanese exist, hut as taxonomic artifacts, rather like "terrestrial mammal" or "creature that flies." The rules for forming them are decomposed into principles of UG that apply to a wide variety of traditional constructions. A particular language L is determined by fixing the values of a finite number of "parameters" of S-0: Do heads of phrases precede or follow their complements? Can certain categories he null (lacking phonctic realization)? Etc. The parameters must be simple enough for values to be set on the basis of restricted and easily obtained data. Language acquisition is the process of fixing these values. The parameters can be thought of as "atoms" of language, to borrow Mark Baker's metaphor. Each human language is an arrangement of these atoms, determined by assigning values to the parameters. The fixed principles are available for constructing expressions however the atoms are arranged in a particular IIanguage. A major goal of research, then, is to discover something like a "periodic table" that will explain why only a very small fraction of imaginahle linguistic systems appear to be instantiated, and attainable in the normal way.

Note that the P&P approach is a program, not a specific theory; it is a framework for theory, which can be developed in various ways. It has proven to be a highly productive program, leading to an explosion of research into languages of a very broad typological range, and in far greater depth than before. A rich variety of previously-unknown phcnomena have been unearthed, along with many new insights and provocative new problems. The program has also led to new and far-reaching studies of language acquisition and other areas of research. It is doubtful that there has ever heen a period when so much has been learned about human language. Certainly the relevant fields look quite different than they did not very long ago.

The P&P approach, as noted, suggested a promising way to resolve the tension between the search for descriptive and explanatory adequacy; at least in principle, to some extent in practice. It became possible, really for the first time, to see at least the contours of what might be a genuine theory of language that might jointly satisfy the conditions of descriptive and explanatory adequacy. That makes it possihle to entertain seriously further questions that arise within the biolinguistic approach, questions that bad been raised much earlier in reflections on generative grammar, but left to the side: questions about how to proceed beyond explanatory adequacy.

It has long been understood that natural selection operates within a "channel" of possibilities estahlished by natural law, and that the nature of an organism cannot truly be understood without an account of how the laws of nature enter into determining its structures, form, and properties. Classic studies of these questions were undertaken by D'Arcy Thompson and Alan Turing, who helieved that these should ultimately become the central topics of the theory of evolution and of the development of organisms (morphogenesis). Similar questions arise in the study of cognitive systems, in particular FL. To the extent that they can be answered, we will have advanced beyond explanatory adequacy.

Inquiry into tbese topics has come to be called " the minimalist program." The study of UG seeks to determine what are the properties of language; its principles and parameters, if the P&P approach is on the right track. The minimalist program asks why language is based on these properties, not others. Specifically, we may seek to determine to what extent the properties of language can he derived from general properties of complex organisms and from the conditions that FL must satisfy to be usable at all: the "interface conditions' imposed by the systems with which FL interacts. Reformulating the traditional observation that language is a system of form and meaning, we observe that FL must at least satisfy interface conditions imposed hy the sensorimotor systems (SM) and systems of thought and action, sometimes called "conceptual-intentional" (CI) systems. We can think of an I-language, to first approximation, as a system that links SM and Cl by generating expressions that are "legible" by these systems, which exist independently of language. Since the states of FL are computational systems, the general properties that particularly concern us are those of efficient computation. A very strong minimalist thesis would hold that FL is an optimal solution to the problem of linking SM and CI, in some natural sense of optimal computation.

Like the P&P approach that provides its natural setting, the minimalist program formulates questions, for which answers are to be sought -- among them, the likely discovery that the questions were wrongly formulated and must be reconsidered. The program resembles earlier efforts to find the best theories of FL. and its states, but poses questions of a different order, hard and intriguing ones: Could it be that FL. and its states are themselves optimal, in some interesting sense? That would he an interesting and highly suggestive discovery, if true. In the past few years there has been extensive study of these topics from many different points of view, with some promising results, I think, and also many new problems and apparent paradoxes.

Insofar as the program succeeds, it will provide further evidence for the Galilean thesis that has inspired the modern sciences: the thesis that "nature is perfect," and that the task of the scientist is to demonstrate this, whether studying the laws of motion, or the structure of snowflakes, or the form and growth of a flower, or the most complex system known to us, the human brain.

The past half century of the study of language has been rich and rewarding, and the prospects for moving forward seem exciting, not only within linguistics narrowly conceived but also in new directions, even including the long-standing hopes for unification of linguistics and the brain sciences, a tantalizing prospect, perhaps now at the horizon.

# Introduction

It is a convention in textbooks to begin with a definition of the field of study. Linguistics textbooks begin with a definition of phonology as the study of the sound systems of language, syntax as the study of the systematic ways sentences are formed in language, and discourse analysis as the system shown in text formation. Unfortunately, there is no single term that we can define that includes semantics, lexicon, and vocabulary. Each has its own definition.

The term semantics refers to the study of meaning and the systematic ways those meanings are expressed in language. Part I of this volume is concerned with semantics and semantic analysis. The term lexicon refers to the overall system of word forms and, when we include morphology, the study of word formation in languages. The term is also used to refer to the way forms might be systematically represented in the brain, that is, the mental lexicon. Parts II and IlI of this book are used to discuss the lexicon and lexical and morphological analyses. The term vocabulary refers to a list or set of words for a particular language or a list or set of words that individual speakers of a language might use. Since vocabulary is a list, we might think that the only system involved is that of alphabetical order. Modern lexicographers, however, are concerned with much more than the alphabetical ordering of words in dictionaries; they, too, look for system. The notion of choice in vocabulary selection and methods used in acquiring and teaching vocahulary also form an important part of this book.

The selection and organization of information within each section of this book posed several problems. There are different ways of carrying out semantic analyses and lexical analyses, and many claims have been made about the acquisition and teaching of vocabulary. Deciding what to present sent us in various directions. This was similar in many ways to a teacher asking what we mean when we say, "I know that word," or when we say we want our students to acquire vocabulary in our language classes. Do we expect that we or our students will know the meaning of the word in all its contexts? Will students know, for example, that just means different things in ${ } ^ { \mathfrak { s o } } \mathbf { I }$ just have to tell you what happened today!" "No one thought the verdict was just," and "There are just 360 shopping days until Christmas"? Do we expect our students to retrieve and use words or only to recognize them when reading? In knowing a word, must

# Vocabulary, semantics, and Ianguage education

we know something of its etymology? Do we need to know how to derive other words from it so that, knowing the word shop, for instance, we can derive "shopping days" or "Christmas shoppers"? As our students acquire vocabulary, do they also learn restrictions on the grammatical use of the words? We may teach words like advise and suggest, but will students automatically note that although \*She advised me to study Japanese" is grammatically correct," \*She suggested me to study Japanese" is not? Words also join in loose to tight chains called collocations. If we teach table, will our students readily chain it in common colloctions such as "sit at the table," "tabletop," "reserve a table," "table the motion," "head of the table," "table mountain," "water table," "table of elements," "turn the tables on," as well as form the same types of association pairs (e.g., table and chair) as native speakers? Must we know the semantics of figurative use of words as well? If we teach common words such as fall, jump, and walk, will our students automatically know they may be used metaphorically for "fall in love," "jump to a conclusion," or "walk it Off"? And, finally, will they know whether a word can be used in both written and spoken language and, if so, whether it will work equally well in stuffy talk, tough talk, and sweet talk? Knowing a word is not as simple as it might seem. Knowing what to include in this volume has also not been as simple as it might seem.

A second problem concerns the importance of hypotheses and the arguments that weigh in favor of or against the hypotheses. For example, there is agreement that semantics is the study of meanings and that we talk about semantics using words. Beyond that there is little agreement as to how meanings should be studied. Most linguists agree, however, that there is a difference between linguistic and conceptual systems (although we believe there is much overlap between linguistic knowledge and conceptual knowledge). An interesting example of the separation of cognitive and linguistic skills is shown in the data of Marta, a retarded adolescent studied by Yamada (1981). Marta's poor numerical concepts are reflected in inaccurate information given in linguistically correct responses. Marta can "count" and knows she should point to items as she counts them. However, she may assign two numbers to a given item or count the same item several times. In cases where she has correctly counted an array of items, she is not then able to say how many items there are, demonstrating a lack of the cardinal concept. In spontaneous speech, her temporal and numerical expressions fall within the appropriate semantic field: "I was like 15 or 19 when I started moving out $\acute { \mathbf { o } }$ home, so now, I'm like 15 now, and I can go." Marta has not grasped the 1-to-1 principle in counting nor the cardinal principle in telling how many items there are (a clear cognitive deficit), yet is able to produce numbers in appropriate places (and even to use ordinals such as in "second friend," "third school"). This leaves us with the problem of specify. ing the boundary line between cognitive and linguistic knowledge. That is, while there is agreement that differences in cognitive and linguistic skills related to semantics and the lexicon exist, linguists and cognitive psychologists are only now beginning to explicate this agreement in terms of the mechanisms which connect language and thought.

In linguistics textbooks, language is often defined as a system, and the task of the linguist is to discover and describe system (the sound system, the semantic system, the lexical system, the morphology system, the syntactic system, the discourse system, and their many suhsystems). Conventionally, a linguistic system is made up of units and processes that operate on the units. In the chapters that follow, descriptions have been made in terms of units (structural description) and others have been made in terms of process (procedural description). For example, metaphor may be described in terms of structural categories such as simile and metonymy or in terms of a process that results in a system that links physical perception with metaphors of life and emotion. Lists of types of antonyms in a structural description may be followed by a process description that links antonyms to the ways we evaluate objects and actions that take place around us. Words may be described as nouns or as verbs in a list of word classes, but a process description may show how nouns can become verbs and vice versa. Linguists approach their task in different ways and, depending on their theoretical orientation, may stress one type of description more than another. We have included both structure and process wherever possible in our descriptions of semantic and lexical systems. The chapters in Part I show a gradual shift in the kinds of questions linguists have asked about the semantic system. Chapter 1 begins with componential analysis, an analysis of the semantic features of words. For example, the meaning of girl is in part determined by the features (+feminine) and (+young). Features are also used in semantic field analysis, allowing us to distinguish among members of a family of lexical forms. Thus, a feature such as (+serving) might help us distinguish the meaning of a ladfe from a spoon in the semantic field of cutlery. Chapter 3 moves to the more cognitive approach to semantics, represented in core semantics and prototype theory. We can use core semantics to analyze the central meanings of words and how meanings extend outward along particular dimensions. For example, if you visualize the concept $c u p .$ there are many ways you might change its shape, the materials from which it is made, and its functions before you must change the word $c \pmb { \mathscr { u } } \pmb { \mathscr { p } }$ to glass, stein, or some other form. In prototype analysis, we select the best exemplar for a particular concept. So, asked to name a tree, we might select oak as the hest example. Chapter 4 looks at the relations among words that help to identify a concept. If we think of a frog, we may also

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

think of jump as a typical action, green as a typical color, croak as a typical sound, and so forth. Chapter 5 discusses figurative language. Figuratively, a frog may be able to talk as Kermit the frog, or, in desperate circumstances, it may be changed into a prince with a kiss. Figurative language, in particular metaphor, is an extremely powerful process that only now is being systematically addressed in semantics. In Chapter 6 we consider the notion of universal concepts and the variety of ways in which linguists have described correspondences in conceptual terms across languages. The final chapter in this section, Chapter 7, is devoted to script semantics (the relation of concepts to larger pieces of the language), which we contrast with the conceptual structure hypothesis (where concepts are linked to sentence syntax).

Part II consists of two chapters on lexical processes by which the vocabulary of a language may be increased. Chapter 8 discusses borrowing, coinage, shifts, and conversions. Borrowing of word forms across languages is a common phenomenon - one with possible positive and negative effects for language learners -- so it receives the most attention. Chapter 9 is about processes of word building, including additive lexical processes (e.g., compounding) and subtractive lexical processes (e.g., clipping). Again, additive processes are those of greatest importance for Ianguage learncrs, so they receive the most emphasis in the discussion.

Part III is concerned with word classes and morphology. Chapter 10 looks at traditional methods of classifying words into parts of speech and the problems that arise from such classifications. Chapter 11 turns to a discussion of morphology and word formation processes with derivational morphology. These processes are those that result in learner errors such as "The opposite of expand is inpand," or "This year is very activity year." The topic of Chapter 12 is inflectional morphology (e.g., verb tense and aspect). Inflectional morphology forms the basis of grammarcentered language instruction, although here it is discussed as a process that is part of the lexical system.

Part IV is concerned with vocabulary choices made in language use (discourse) and how that choice is influenced by a variety of social factors. Chapter 13 highlights variation in lexical choice owing to register, individual style, gender, age, and role differences. Sociolinguistic studies of geographic and social groups are also discussed. In Chapter 14 we consider the vocabulary of communication signals and the lexical choices available for particular speech acts.

Although every chapter of this book is related to language acquisition, language learning, and language teaching, Part V takes these topics as its major focus. Chapter 15 highlights the strategies and processes learners employ to acquire and use vocabulary. Chapter 16 considers more specifically how learners can be assisted in the acquisition process by teacher strategies and vocabulary pedagogy.

Because one can find information about the topics in other sources, our goal is to do more than just inform language teachers and language students about a wide and interesting array of topics which affecr language learning. Therefore, we have selected examples from language learner data that demonstrate the structures and processes and the difficulties these pose for learners. Data in these examples come from learners of varying proficiency levels, ages, and first-language backgrounds. Examples of processes are drawn from many languages as well.

We believe that learning about any field is easier if the information presented is put into use, so, unlike other books on semantics and lexicon, this book encourages you to use the information. Each chapter includes Practice sections that make the connection between description and application more explicit. They give hands-on experience with data and offer suggestions for related research projects. At the end of each chapter is a Research and Application section. Here you will find brief summaries of research similar to that discussed in the chapter. You are not expected to complete every Practice item or answer all the questions posed in the Research and Application section. Rather, consider each one, and, after reading the summaries, select those that relate to your interests and carry out the suggested research or further investigate the questions posed.

This book will not give you specific techniques to teach vocabulary. However, it should help you make better decisions about approaches to teaching. You will find a wealth of ideas for teaching and for materials development in the descriptions and the research summaries. The book will help you to understand why you or your students successfuly acquire some iexical processes and yet fail with others. That understanding should also enhance your teaching and learning.

Our overall goal in preparing this book has been to reveal system at the semantic and lexical levels of language and to relate that information to vocabulary acquisition and language education. This overall goal has been divided into several course objectives.

These objectives have many relevant applications, in teaching and elsewhere. Think about each of the following situations. If you can match them to our objectives and to the topics listed in the table of contents, you will understand why it is important (and fun) to study this subject matter.

1. The librarian tells you that she has year-end funds to spend on dictionaries for your school. Because the users are mainly ESL students, she wonders if there are any special features she should consider in deciding which dictionaries to order. What can you tell her?

2. Your principal is upset because bilingual children in your classroom scored at a very low percentile on a standard English vocabulary test (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, English version) whereas they do well in the Spanish version of the same test. You don't understand this because the children appear to have the vocabulary needed for their schoolwork. The principal wonders how any child in this school could not know common words such as lamp, bread, refrigerator, and stove. How do you explain this? Does your explanation make any predictions as to what Spanish items the children might not know?

3. A fellow language tcacher sighs and tells you that his students need a biology lesson, not a language lesson, because even very advanced students keep confusing e and she. Do you agree?

4. One of your international students says that Americans are too visually oriented. He claims that expressions such as "look it over," "give someone the eye," "private eye," and even the national anthem, "Oh say can you see," show this is the case. You are planning a cross-cultural communication class. Would this be something to include in your materials?

5. Teachers of advanced level courses complain that students are nor taught the basics because they still leave off the -s ending for third person singular (e.g., ${ \pmb g } { \pmb O }$ for goes). Teachers of the lower-level courses claim they have covered this grammar point. As the coordinator of courses, you must explain why this happens. You also want the teachers to work out a plan to solve the problem. What might you do?

6. A Korean student says that after undergraduation, she will study law. Another student writes that the computer is very scientifical. The teachers in your program keep a list of such creative examples in the hope that you will be able to see which are systematic (i.e., occur often enough to suggest you might want to prepare a self-access Study unit). What do you predict?

7. Your first translation job is to convert a piece of technical writing from French into English. You have a bilingual dictionary for the Canadian technical terms in the subject field, and you complete the translation. Just for fun, you give your translation to a friend who is knowledgeable about the field. She returns the article to you saying she did not understand very much of your translated article. Shc understands the subject matter, so what could be wrong with your translation?

8. You have been asked to critique reading materials for child second language learners. The publisher says that vocabulary was selected on the basis of frequency and that each word is repeated a minimum of eight times in a book. You find thc word space used for Sally

Ride's spacesuit, for blank spaces on a page, for a space heater, and the space a dog needs for exercise. Do you severely criticize the materials based on such observations?

9. You've noticed that science textbooks contain a large number of compounds (e.g., seven-digit numbers, central facility, numerical analysis). At the same time, you note that students almost never produce such compounds in their writing. Should you stress this kind of vocabulary in both reading and writing lessons?

10. In orientation, a foreign student asks you for help in identifying and locating the Coop, Ugly, and Cog-Sci. You explain that these are abbreviated forms for the Student Cooperative, the undergraduate library, and the cognitive science building. In dismay, the student asks if you can abbreviate all English words or just names of buildings. What do you reply?

11. A book publisher has asked you to write vocabulary notes for a novel which will be used by English majors in a university in Thailand. How will you decide which vocabulary itcms to annotate?

12. Your sister's infant is just beginning to talk, and she calls the dog, the cat, a furry jacket, a fuzzy pillow, and your bearded neighbor all wau-wau. She calls everything she puts in her mouth kee. Your sister is worried. Can the baby's utterances be normal?

13. A student asks you why people say up and down instead of happy and unhappy. You ask for an example, and he says \*I'm really down today." What is your explanation?

14. You have taught a lesson on count and mass nouns. The students seem to accept your explanation about what is and what is not countable. Later you notice that we count noodles but not spaghetti, onions but not garlic, beans but not rice, headaches but not flu. Did your explanation make sense?

15. Many languages have one word for the colors blue and green. Does this mean that they cannot distinguish between these two colors? Are dark blue and light blue really the same color?

16. Is it true that preschool-age bilingual children know fewer words than monolingual children? Your neighbor is using this claim as an argument against your use of two languages with children in your family. How do you respond?

17. A friend is from a part of the country where people say slick $\pmb { u } \pmb { p }$ for clean, mulish for stubborn, and reckon instead of guess. You claim she shouldn't be allowed near an English language class. She points out that other teachers say chaps and mates for friends, gueue $\pmb { u } \pmb { \mathcal { P } }$ for get in line, and petrol instead of gas and nobody objects. Can she keep her regional dialect when she teaches?

18. You have a difficult time saying no to invitations. You have been told that it's better just to say, "I'm sorry, 1 have other plans." Somehow this lexical phrase by itself does not seem to work. What other strategy might you use?   
19. At an applied linguistics conference, the program includes titles with words such as prototype, conceptual metaphor, scripts and schemas, cognates, loan translation, core semantics, and a host of other terms that sound vaguely familiar. What is all this jargon?   
20. One of your students tells you that even though he is not trying to be funny, his friends often jiggle when he speaks, telling him that he is very humus. He asks you if there are any exercises he might do to help him overcome his problem. What would you suggest?   
21. The faculty members of your intensive language program are having a disagreement about whether you should use simplified or standard versions of classical literary works as reading texts. Those favoring simplified versions say that students cannot understand the standard versions. Those favoring standard versions say that the literary flavor of the texts is much better and that the difficulty of the books will help the students learn more words. What suggestions might you make to help resolve the conflict?

We can't promise that after working through this text you will react wisely to such situations, but we hope to introduce you to a wide variety of analytic methods that will give you the foundations to respond appropriately in these and similar contexts. You wili notice that no objective asks you to trace the historical development of lexical and semantic analysis. And no objective asks you to give a history of techniques by which methodologists have enhanced learning of vocabulary. This means that you may complete this book without a real appreciation of the history of linguistics and language teaching methodology related to the lexicon. History is important and we believe that such objectives should be an integral part of any introductory course in general linguistics or methods of language teaching. Although we have treated such information in an implicit way throughout the book, we leave an explicit, detailed history to others.

As you look through the objectives and the table of contents, you may realize that your own goals and objectives differ from ours. As you draw up your goals, list them for class or study group discussion. Consider, too, how meeting your objectives might be useful when the knowledge obtained is applied to Ianguage learning, to materials development, language testing, or areas of second language evaluation and research.

# Semantic features and semantic feature analysis

One way of telling someone what a word means is to point to the item and say, "That's a shirt." However, we might also say, " Well, it covers the upper part of the body, it has sleeves, it usually buttons down the front," and so forth. This is a feature (or componential) method of definition rather than a pointing (or deictic) definition. The features or components help us to index the meanings of words, separate the various meanings of individual words, and help us to analyze relationships between similar words. Componential analysis originated with the work of Trubetzkoy and the Prague School of Linguistics, but it is perhaps better known now as semantic feature analysis.

# Features

Semantic feature analysis is based on the similarities among sets of words. For example, look at the following list: Lady Macbeth, Ophelia, King Lear, Hamlet, Charlie Chaplin. Notice that all but one name are characters in a Shakespeare play. So we might say that Charlie Chaplin does not fit because his name does not share the $[ + S .$ hakespearean character] feature. On another list we might find these names: Mae West, Stan Laurel, W. C. Fields, Shirley Temple, Charlie Chaplin. All of these people were movie stars, but, again, Chaplin would be separated from the group by a feature [+mime] because traditionally his were nonspeaking roles. Or, alternatively, Chaplin could be kept on the list and Shirley Temple eliminated on the basis of (+child).

A set of words such as idea, newspaper, chair, and book, present three (+concrete) nouns. We can actually point to a newspaper, a chair, or a book and say, "That's a newspaper," or "That's a chair," or "That's a book." We cannot point to an object and say, "That's an idea." Idea is an abstract noun, so it does not fit with those that are (+concrete). You may have noticed that some of the names on the first two lists are feminine and some masculine. In semantic feature analysis this is noted as $( + l )$ male). This semantic feature has consequences for grammar. Nouns witb this feature can be referred to by the pronouns she or he.

In another set of nouns -- cheese, catsup, lettuce, carrot - the critical semantic feature is (+count). We can count carrots, but we usually employ other units for mass nouns: pieces of cheese, bottles of catsup, heads of lettuce, as opposed to three carrots. Count nouns take a plural -s. The feature (+count) is important in grammar because it determines the type of verb agreenent required (e.g., "carrots are nutritious" vs. "lettuce is nutritious").

Features are thus helpful in two ways. General perceptual features help us distinguish among related sets of terms (as in the Charlie Chaplin examples). Other features are more grammatically based (e.g., abstract vs. concrete, mass vs. count). The problem for the linguist is to find a descriptive system that uses both types of features in a principled way.

The semantic feature analysis devised by Katz and Fodor (1963) illustrates an early attempt to do just that (see Figure 1.1). Their analysis describes the assignment of meaning to words in an additive fashion. To illustrate their system, they chose a polysemous word, bachelor, and diagrammed the features needed to account for its several different meanings. (Since all (+human) nouns must be animate, it is not really necessary to specify the (+animate) feature in the diagram. To do so would be redundant, and in linguistics redundant descriptions are not favored.) Notice that all but one meaning has the $\langle + \mathsf { m a l e } \rangle$ feature. In all probability, the academic meaning of bachelor also originally shared that feature.

Some of the features in the bachelor example (e.g., animate, human, male) are important in the analysis of meanings for large numbers of words. They are especially important because they have consequences in grammar. Only animate nouns can carry out actions such as sleeping and eating. Human nouns can carry out actions such as reading and talking. And male and female nouns are referred to by the pronouns he and she. The features that have consequences in grammar are called semantic markers. For linguists, in particular American linguists working within the generative school, these became the central features of interest. In this system, every word in the lexicon would include all the semantic markers that need to be considered in order to produce grammatical sentences.

Other features distinguish meanings for only a very limited number of words. That is, [+furry] is unlikely to distinguish meanings for a large number of words, nor does it have grammatical importance. In semantic feature analysis, these features are called distinguishers. We have used() for semantic markers, those with grammar consequences, and [ ] for those that are distinguishers. Distinguishers are of nuch less interest to linguists. To semanticists and to language teachers, however, both types of features are important in analyzing the meanings of single words.

In a linguistic description thar uses semantic feature analysis, then, a word like sheep would include semantic marker information such as word class $\langle { \bf + N o u n } \rangle$ and the features $\mid +$ animate), (-human), and $\left. + \mathsf { c o u n t } \right.$ . Thus, it could be placed in the noun slot (as a subject, an object, or in a prepositional phrase) of a sentence. Because it is animate, it could be placed as a subject before verbs such as sleep and eat. Because it is not human, it could not be placed as a subject before verbs such as read and talk. We know that we can count sheep, therefore, the entry wouid mark the noun as (+count) so that subject-verb agrcement applies (e.g., "that sheep is white"; "these sheep are white'). However, we know that the plural for sheep is not sheeps, so we would need a special type of rule feature to tell us that this particular noun has a "zero" plural.

![](img/2f57b4921f3e2c2f7329f7a2041e9c304f0fed146657454b52b447d13f223edd.jpg)  
Figure 1.1 Semantic feature diagram for bachelor (from Katz and Fodor, 1963, p. 186; used with permission)

Information important to language learners and to semanticists would also include a set of distinguishers for each entry. For example, we would want to add a feature [+wooly] for sheep. We might assume, since the entry already says that sheep is animate and not human, that we would not need to enter a feature for [+four-legged]. Still, birds are animate and not human and have two legs, so in order to separate these, we need to add this $[ + \beta$ four-legged] feature. Or perhaps we can use the $[ + 1 .$ wooly] feature or a $[ + 1 .$ feathers] feature to distinguish them.

Asked to define sheep, we are likely to say it is an animal with a wooly coat. The fact that we supply features when defining a word shows that features have some validity. Another piece of evidence used to validate the feature approach comes from slip-of-the-tongue studies. When we are tired, we may produce slips of the tongue where we utter a word other than the word we intend. The word we produce often shares many features with the intended word. Fromkin (1973) gives examples where speakers substitute one body part for another - "my knee hurts' where ankle was meant, and "on my wrist" when finger was meant. The intended word and the substitution share tbe features of [+body part].

There is also evidence of the importance of features in the acquisition of words. When we point to a hook and say, "That's a book," we mean that the book is one of a class of items that we arbitrarily call book. This is a basic notion infants must master. Itard (1962) described his attempts to teach Victor, a "wild child" found at age 11 or 12 in the forests of Aveyron, France, such lexical items as book, key, pen, knife by associating word cards with the objects in this way. Victor became adept at "reading" the words on the cards and pointing out the corresponding objects. Itard was at first pleased with Victor's success. But when the door was locked to the room where the test items were kept, Victor failed. Given a card with the word book on it, he ignored the books in the room and tried to get into the locked room. "Thus every book which was not the one he had in his room was not a book to Victor" (p. 75). This was a teacher-induced error which fortunately could be corrected. Onee Victor realized that a word like book referred to a class of items - books in general - he was faced with determining just how far the term could he generalized. For example, are large books, books placed in a case, or books with soft covers still books? Like child first language learners, Victor began to overextend the meanings of words according to the features of shape and use. He called pages, handfuls of paper, notebooks, newspapers, and pamphlets books. All straight, long objects made of wood became sticks. Knife became the term for anything that cuts.

Young children go through similar phases. Prior to two years of age, children may believe that words name particular objects (that ball refers only to the particular ball that they see roll under the bed) rather than to a class of objects. There is also a brief period, usually between $\uparrow \%$ and $^ { 2 \% }$ years, when children use a word appropriately for an object and then use the same word for other objects sharing some of its features. For example, in the famous study of his bilingual child Hildegard, Leopold (1939) notes her initial use of wau-wau for dog. Then she used the $[ + \tan \tt c r y ]$ feature of texture to allow wau-wau for furry slippers and a picture of a man wearing a fur coat. Lewis's (1951) child said kotibaiz for the bars of her cot and then used it for a large toy abacus, the toast rack (with parallel bars), and a picture of a building with columns. E. Clark (1973), in her analysis of such overextensions, shows they are primarily related to per. ceptual qualities of shape, size, movement, sound, taste, and texture.

Thus, there is considerable developmental evidence that learners do attend to semantic features in analyzing the meanings of words and assigning words to referents. Unfortunately, formal semantic feature analysis has not captured this as adequately as we might like. Most semantic feature analysis has been limited to markers that have grammar consequences and, as in arguments tbat support the validity of features, semantic markers do not appear as frequently as distinguisher features in research on slips of the tongue or developmental studies.

# Practice 1.1

1. In each of the following sets of words, one word does not belong. Identity the feature(s) which unite the group and allow you to discard the "out' member. Which are semantic markers and which are distinguishers?

cat, fur coat, bear, table clock, bathtub, gas meter, bathroom scale doctor, mayor, president, governor sing, accuse, blame, criticize happiness, talent, table, understanding corporation, thought, university, congress

2. Kelly, a 2-year-old, (data source: L. Hunt) used the word bi for the following objects: bean, bee, piece of gravel, cigarette butt, any insect, marble. What does bi mean?

3. Martin, a 3-year-old English speaker (Nemoianu, 1980, p. 489), gave the tollowing definitions while playing with Sean, a German-dominant playmate. In each, determine which features Martin believes are important in the definition.

Example A

Sean:Who's Batman?

Martin: He's the guy which has the thing on his back that flies. He's a, he's a, he's a man which has something on his back to fly up in the sky with.

Example 8

Sean: What's a dis?

Martin: It's an Exxon truck. It carries gas. It's an Exxon truck and they carry gas. I like Chevron better.

4. Here are some of E. Clark's (1973) examples ot irfants extending the meanings of words along features. (Clark drew these examples from the data in several classic diary studies in which a linguist-parent analyzed the language development of a child over an extended time period.)

mooii $\left[ \mathbf { \sigma } \right] =$ moon) -- cakes - round marks on windows postmarks buti $\{ =$ ball)  toy  radish - rounded stones bebe $\{ \mathbf { = }$ self in mirror)  photo of self --- all photos  all pictures  all books with pictures  all books fater i $\{ =$ train sound) -- steaming coffee pot - anything

that hissed or made a noise

# Semantic features and semantic feature analysis

bebe $\{ =$ baby) -- other babies -- all small statues -- tigures in small pictures and prints fly $\{ =$ fly) - specks of dirt - dust  all small insects his own toes - crumbs of bread -- a small toad

In each example, identify and give a name to the feature used in the extension. Notice that two children gave extensions for bebe. Does your distinguishing feature differ for these two examples? It you can observe infants at a nursery, note examples of their extensions. Do they fit into Clark's perceptual categories?

# Features in synonyms and antonyms

Synonyms are words that share meanings. Dictionaries traditionally provide a list of words that are more or less synonymous for each entry. A thesaurus, too, presents synonyms but it also gives words whose meanings are opposites (antonyms).

We assume that synonyms refer to the same entity. If all features are the same, the words should be interchangeable. However, native speakers will consistently select among them in similar ways. For example, we might assign the same features to cease and stop and yet realize that cease is most often selected in legal discourse. A mother is unlikely to say, "Cease that!" to a misbehaving child. Such words may be synonyms, but they survive in the language because there are differences in the ways and situations in which they are used.

Of course, synonyms do not usually share all of their features. We often use synonyms to make our lexical choices more precise. The expressions or rather, technically, and more exactly mark this use of a synonym for added precision. We may also use expressions to show that we cannot produce the precise term we wish to use: "in a manner of speaking,' "sort of," "kind of." It is clear, though, that few (if indeed any) synonyms are synonymous in every respect. Some forms are better than others for a particular use in particular circumstances. And, so, they have slightly different features.

Although dictionaries list synonyms as words with similar meanings, the fact that $X$ is a synonym for Y does not mean that $\mathbf { Y }$ is necessarily a synonym for X. For example, the Dictionary of American Synonyms lists murder as a synonym of kill but does not list kill as a synonym for murder. Powerful is listed as a synonym for strong but not vice versa. The Dictionary of English Synonyms lists old, elderly, and senile as its first three synonyms for aged. Old has aged and senile as its sixth and seventh choices; ancient is the first choice. The entry for ancient lists old as the first choice but does not mention senile. There is no entry for senile in this dictionary. Elderly is also not listed, although the synonyms for elder are senior, older, and father. Would this mean that it is only aged mothers who are termed senile?

One of the most important ways that we make text hold together is with the use of synonyms or chains of related words. For exampie, in talking about a problem at school, we might use school, university, college, campus, or other words interchangeably as synonyms. We might also select words that are not synonyms but which still refer to the same object. We might choose words that are related in features like candle, flame, flicker, light in describing candlelight. They all relate to light and, although they are not strictly synonyms, they share features and are used as though they were.

Antonyms, words which mean the opposite, present interesting problems for anyone seriously interested in semantic feature analysis. We can usually identify the feature on which the two words contrast. For example, hot and cold refer to the poles of a temperature dimension; one is positive and the other negative. Long and short refer to poles of a length dimension. North and south refer to direction in relation to a magnetic point, one pointing toward that point and the other pointing away from it. Thus, their meanings differ in terms of having or lacking qualities for a (distinguisher) semantic feature.

Many apparent opposites, however, are really extreme points on graduated scales. This is especially true of adjectives. Hot and cold may seem like opposites, but temperature is scaled, and we make our judgments as to what constitutes hot, warm, cool, and cold along that scale. The dimension is not just bisected into a plus and a minus value. In the same way, pairs like big-small, many--few, tall-short, happy-unhappy, and Iong-short are the opposite ends of scales. When we ask, \*How long is your jacket?" "How unhappy is he?" "How tall is she?" "How many are there?" or "How small is it?" it is clear that there is no absolute point even at the poles. The terms are subjective and imprecise; they do not refer to an absolute place on the dimension. There is no obvious way semantic feature analysis can separate all these scalar points into plus or minus categories. (One could, of course, just change the dichotomies to scales.)

In language acquisition, researchers have found that semantic feature analysis is particularly helpful in understanding the acquisition of synonyms and antonyms. The research shows that one member of a pair of antonyms is more basic and easier to learn. The easier term in the pair is said to be unmarked and the more difficult marked. Positive (unmarked) terms are generally easier to learn than (marked) negatives. So happy is usually acquired before unbappy; high is usually acquired before low. To ask \*How short is he?" assumes that the person is, indeed, short, whereas \*How tall is he?" makes no assumption of whether the person is tall or short. Tall, the unmarked term, is easier and should be acquired first. If we ask "How unhappy is he?" we assume the person is unhappy, whereas "How happy is he?" makes no assumption. Happy is the more basic, unmarked form. This can be handled in a semantic feature approach by making the unmarked member of the pair the name of the feature so that the marked member would be minus for that feature.

# Practice 1.2

1. Bolinger (1975, p. 195) gives examples of synonyms that cannot be separated using semantic markers. To take back and to return seem to be synonyms, but a feature of "belongingness" distinguishes the two. For exampie, what difference do you see between saying, "We took Tom back to the zoo." and "We returned Tom to the zoo"? A feature of "goal" seerns to separate the verbs go and head for. What difference do you see between ${ ^ { * } } \mathfrak { t }$ went home" and "I headed for home'? (Since so many such features seem to be necessary to separate the meanings of synonyms, Bolinger questions whether the entire lexicon can be accounted for using only a few hundred rather than thousands of features.)

2. Check a dictionary of synonyms for any two nouns, two adverbs, two adjectives, and two verbs. Select one of the synonyms tor each entry and check its synonyms. Are they reciprocal with the original entry?

3. If you have access to a computer and a corpus of data, check the frequency of the following pairs ot synonyms.

trip-journey tell-relate plan-scheme hide-conceal nearly-almost fast-rapid say--explain book-volume something-entity attempt-try end-conclude location-place munch-chew go on-continue talk-converse

In your data, which item for each pair is more frequent? If you have an oral language data base, check the frequencies there as well to see whether they are the same for oral and wrtten text.

4. Dittmar (1984) notes that a Spanish worker who spoke a pidgin form of German used the following forms: nicht gut (instead of sch/echt), nicht krank (instead of gesund), nicht fang (for kurz), nicht teuer (for billig)- Why should opposites via negation be easier to leam than antonyms? It the leamer did not study German at school, would he actually have heard the forms he produced? How would you explain his use of these forms?

5. Here is an antonym list written by a third-grade SpanishEnglish bilingual child.

All the opeceves I now. up-down, in-out, boy-girl, small-larj, open-close, walk-fly, sit-stend, queen-king, nite-left, mom-dad, Mrs.--Mr., stop-go, sky-flore, happy-sad, man-woman, black-white, animal-- person

(Data source: B. Hawkins & V. Wenzell)

Do you consider all these "opeceves" antonyms? List your own antonyms for each pair. Are they the same? If not. why not?

6. Chaudron (1982) discusses the types of synonyms and antonyms teachers and students use in classrooms. Here are a few examples:

Exampie A T: What's his main point. . . . What's the main statement?

Example B

T: What does surrender mean? S: Give up. T: You give up. You stop fighting.

Example C

T: By temperance he probably means not drinking.

Example D T: Kojak. . . . he's bald. OK? No hair.

Chaudron notes that in some cases the synonyms and antonyms were not clear. In some cases, teachers did not select common and familiar terms. Implicit correspondences are not as clear as those where teachers explicitly mark the terms as synonyms or opposites. Tape record your class (whether you are a teacher or a student) and transcribe the synonyms and antonyms. What makes the elaborations clear or confusing for students?

7. It has often been claimed that it is easier to learn antonyms than synonyms. Why should this be the case? What evidence from your teaching or language learning support this claim? Do you think synonyms change in difficulty depending on how proficient one is in the language? How might you research this question in your own classroom setting?

# Features in definitions

When one of your students asks you for a definition of a word, you are likely to respond with whatever synonyms you can think of and a list of features that they share. Features are very helpful in giving meanings to words, but are some better than others? We know that some features are obligatory. For example, a tree must have a trunk and roots, but branches and leaves may be optional at different periods in a tree's life. In reality, though, people are more likely to define trees in terms of their branches and leaves than they are in terms of trunk or roots. The best definitions seem to be those which match what is most salient in perceptual terms.

One way researchers evaluate verbal skills of young children is by examining their ability to supply definitions for words or to give definitions as part of classification tasks. In classification tasks, children are given a series of picture cards and asked to sort them into piles and then explain why cards in each pile go together. Bruner (1966) found that the youngest children sorted picture cards by visual features (color, size, shape). This is not surprising, given E. Clark's (1973) work that shows children begin classification by using perceptual categories. Somewhat older children sorted cards according to visual features ("these all have holes in them") and by use ("you get dressed with"). By 8 years of age, children identified the comnon feature of their grouped cards ("all are tools," "you can eat them").

In tests where learners do not just name items but also give definitions, there is a good deal of controversy about rating responses. Cazden asks a very pertinent question: "Why are some definitions better than others?" (1972, p. 73). Why, she asks, is it "better" if the child defines wagon as a vehicle, rather than saying that you can ride in it? Yet in the literature on child language and in bilingual research, one way of judging a child's verbal abilities is to rate his or her responses in this way. The lowest rating is given to function definitions and the highest to a synonym, a word which captures shared features. Perhaps this is because first language learners seem to proceed through the developmental stages described by Bruner and others. If older children use fewer functional features in definitions, then these responses should be rated lower than definitions which use other types of features. Yet in some very complex fields, such as physics, function definitions are considered best. And in poetry, functional definitions abound as in this opening to a verse of Gaspar de Alba's poem "Beggar on the Cordoba Bridge":

Domingo means scrubbing our knees for church.

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

Or Frost's poem "The Death of the Hired Man":

Home is the place where, when you have to go there   
They have to take you in.

(1969, p. 165)

# Practice 1.3

1. Replicate Bruner's card-sorting task with your students. Do they all sort cards in the same way, or are there differences according to first language background? What comments or definitions do they offer in explaining why each pile forms a group?   
2. After reading Cazden's remarks (1972, p. 73) on definitions, decide how you would scale children's definitions and those of your students. Then score the card-sorting comments and definitions in Practice 1.3.1 according to your scale. Would you obtain different results if you followed a methodoiogy that gives a very low rating.to function definitions?   
3. Snow et al. (1991) used the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children  Revised vocabulary subtest as one measure of verbal abilities of children in grades 2, 4, and 6. Because the vocabulary test is the one test that did correlate with home and school variables, it is important that the test be valid and reliable. Look at the test and critique the items and scoring methods.

# Semantic features and grammar

So far we have talked about semantic features that may guide us in differentiating the match between words and meanings. We would need a very large number of features to do this work, however. Linguists believe that a much smaller number of features would be needed in writing grammar descriptions Many nouns, for example, have special requirements regarding subject-verb agreement and this requirement would be listed as a feature of the noun. It is unlikely that [+furry] would determine anything about subject-verb agreement or pluralization in a language, but $( + 1$ count) might. It's unlikely that [+wings] would have grammatical consequences, but $( + 1$ -human) might very well determine which nouns can be subjects of particular verbs.

Semantic markers that have grammatical consequences are of special importance for linguistic descriptions. Not all of these features are univer.

sal. Most languages have arbitrary classification schemes. That is, they classify objects in some way and then use grammar markers to reveal the classification. Although the classification may seem arbitrary, generaily speaking, languages have a series of binary oppositions, such as singular vs. plural or masculine vs. feminine, and then various agreement rules that relate to the oppositions. Some of the most typical noun oppositions are the following:

singular vs. plural count vs. mass human vs. nonhuman animate vs. inanimate male vs. female vertical vs. horizontal rigid vs. flexible liquid vs. solid

In some languages, of course, these are not simple dichotomies, but rather three-way contrasts. For example, you might find:

singular-dual-plural male-female-neuter liquid-viscous-solid

Distinctions such as (+/--human),(+/-count), $( + 1$ -animate), $( + l )$ concrete) have important consequences for English, and in many European languages as well. However, this does not mean that all languages will necessarily attend granmatically to the same features.

Gender is an important feature in many languages. If our first language does not use this distinction, it can pose a serious problem in second language learning. In a diary study, Kenyeres and Kenyeres (1938) described the reaction to noun gender of Eva, a Hungarian 7-year-old learning French. Hungarian does not mark nouns for gender. In January, Eva enumerated new words: "La chaise, la table" and then corrected herself to "le table," because the table was the papa while the chair was the little girl. Then she continued, "l4 fleur, le jardin - no, la jardin," because it was the mother of flowers. Later that month, she decided all things good and beautiful must be feminine, but soon found that this did not work. She was indignant to find that oiseau had only one gender and that one did not consider the mother of the birds and the babies as different. Yet she also wanted more system. If one would say "un oiseau," then all birds should be marked with un. Learning noun gender continued to be difficult for Eva. Given that adjectives agree with nouns in gender and number, you can predict the consequences of this problem.

# Vocabuiary, semantics, and language education

Even in cases where languages do make the same typical oppositions, we cannot say learning will be trouble free. Many languages, for example, distinguish count vs. mass as a noun feature, and yet the things which seem to be mass or countable differ across languages. In English, the word money can't be counted. That is, we cannot say "one money,' whereas in American Sign Language money is countable. ASL students of English may put money into the count category, writing questions such as "How marry does it cost?" Other ESL students frequently speak of luggages or homeworks. ESL teachers themselves sometimes become confused when they have to remember differences across dialects; for example, that math is a mass form in American English but maths is countable in British English. So there are differences in what is and is not countable even across dialects of the same language.

Although such distinctions can be problematic for language learners, the system can be described by linguists. Semantic feature analysis has been a useful way of linking these descriptions to the identification of features that would be needed for a theory relating semantics to grammar.

# Practice 1.4

1. Navajo has 11 noun subclasses which require different kinds of agreement rules. Devise a $+ \beta -$ feature title for each of the following groups on the basis of whatever semantic similarities you see within them.

rock book bottle hat coin pencil pole cigarette rod snarled hair tangled string loose hay wispy clouds fog mud tar mortar beat-up felt hat sheet of paper animal hide blanket burden load body of water storm clouds rope string hair any unknown object

2. Dyirbal noun classes were the inspiration for the title of Lakoff's (1987) book Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things. Read the section of the book (pp. 92-104) that deals with Dixon's (1968, 1982) descriptions of these noun classes. What semantic basis is reflected in Dyirbal noun classes and why does Lakoff find this so interesting?   
3. The $( + l )$ count) feature for nouns which can or cannot be counted has important consequences in terms of articles or other determiners. Mark with an asterisk $( ^ { \star } )$ the unacceptable combinations in the following lists.

# Semantic features and semantic feature analysis

enough syrup some kerosene fewer jewels enough letter some dime fewer concerts too much sugar two chairs fewer luggages one foliage two furniture fewer jewelry

many syrup a few sugar less sugar much letter a few letters fess letters too much bean a few letter less luggages one leaf tewer letters less syrup

Which quantifiers can be used with (+count) nouns, and which go with mass (-count) nouns? The distinction between mass and count nouns is usually presented early in English language teaching textbooks. If you teach advanced learners, check your materials to see what kind of foltow-up is done with this distinction.

4. Japanese nas something similar to our quantifiers. Identity what unities the following nouns that can be quantified by hon:

hon with long thin objects, rope, hair, dead snakes, dried fish, baseball hits, shots in basketball, serves in volleyball

If you cannot find a Japanese speaker to check your answer, read the section in Lakoff (1987, pp. 104-109) that talks about Downing's (1984) analysis of hon. If this is not possible, try this alternative activity: List the kinds of quantifiers used in English (e.g., heads of, pieces of) and illustrate the noun categories with which they can be used.

5. Most languages have singular and plural forms. Still, what needs to be pluralized will not aiways correspond across languages. For example, vacation can be singular or plural in English but always has the plural form vacances in French. Many languages have a distinction between count and mass nouns. Again, what is countable is not always the same across languages. For example, information is a mass noun in English. To count information we would use "X pieces of information." If you are a speaker of another language, translate these terms and see whether they correspond. Or, if you teach international students, note which students say "I went for vacations' or "I need some informations." Ask them for the corresponding terms in their first languages.

# Evaluation of semantic feature analysis

As you may have realized already, the dividing line between semantic features that have grammatical consequences and those that do not is often unclear. This is one of the basic criticisms of semantic feature analysis. For example, features such as $\left\lfloor + \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace \thinspace m \ a l l \right\rfloor$ or $\{ + \mathbf { d e a r l }$ are needed to account for the diminutive /i/ applied to many nouns (e.g., kitty, horsie, mommy), but these are not included in the list of marker features with grammatical consequences. If we usc only features that apply to many items (such as (+animate)) and do not use distinguishers, our linguistic description will not tell us that sheep can be combined with verbs such as baa or bleat, while horse cannot. It will not tell us that bird can combine with $f l y$ but snail cannot. Further, we will not even be able to disambiguate words like bachelor in sentences without the use of distinguishers. Both types of features must be used or some more sophisticated crossreference rules must be given if we want our linguistic descriptions to yield sensihle interpretations of sentences.

A second problem pointed out by Bolinger (196s) is that of redundancy. We know that there are many markers that have consequences in grammar. The question is whether all of these need to be shown for every entry. For example, a feature such as (+solid) is needed so that we do not create sentences such as "she walked right through the bachelor." A feature (+pliable) is needed to prevent "he broke the bachelor in two." And a feature (+organic) is needed to disallow "she welded the bachelor." These markers are part of being or not being human and of being an animal. Should every dictionary entry include these along with (+human) and (+animal)? If we put them in, the analysis method suffers from redundancy. If we do not, nothing (except the oft-cited "world knowledge") prevents construction of anomalous sentences. The analysis does not tell us precisely how this problem would be solved.

A third problem has to do with the naming of features. Bolinger argues that we should make a serious effort to find terms that are abstract enough to cover all the possihle correspondences under it. The distinguisher $[ + 1 - \alpha ] \Delta ]$ is not a good term for a feature if we consider all the different objects that might have that particular feature. Bolinger suggests the use of an early-late feature because it can be used with any item that adjusts to a temporal scale:

Early state Late state living being young old humanity primitive advanced perishable product fresh stale other product new old lunar phase waxing waning

# Semantic features and semantic feature analysis

Early state Late state   
tide flood ebb   
fruit green ripe   
growing things immature mature (Source: Bolinger, 1965, p. 440)

A fourth obvious problem for semantic feature analysis is that the features are presented as dichotomies when, in fact, we know that something may be somewhere in-between. In the early-late dichotomy, there has to be room in the middle. We know teenager is (+human). We also know that it has the feature of youth. But, while it is more young than old, it is not exactly young. If we assign it [+earlyl, then what separates it from child and infant? We know that nasty, mean, small-minded, and petty are all [+pejorative] words. To separate the terms, we can't just label them all as [+pejorative]; we need to use a scale. Many features are scales, not dichotomies.

A fifth difficulty has to do with the use of markers when we interpret words metaphorically. Bolinger diagrams the meanings of the word soup as given in the Merriam-Webster dictionary. They include the meaning of an edible liquid food, but soup is also used to talk about thick clouds in "flying through the soup," where diffuse clouds are made to appear dense. When the [+dense] quality of soup is taken over to change diffuse clouds to something dense, the marker is being used metaphorically. We have said that markers are supposed to be features of a word. They either are or are not characteristics of the word. The analysis says nothing about using them across a range of words for metaphorical purposes. That puts the analysis "in the soup."

Modern linguistics has set these and other issues aside in the hope that they can be addressed at some later time after much more work has been done on the syntax (sentence grammar) of languages. At this point, the features that allow grammatically correct (if semantically strange) sentences are used. Those who study semantics must decide whetber or not their major task ought to be that of determining how semantic features relate to grammar description.

Semantic feature dispiays, such as that given in Figure 1 for bachelor, have also been criticized. In tree displays, the feature listed at the top of the hierarchy will be the most general and most important feature, and each split after that will also be hierarchical in nature. There is often no clear rationale for arrangements that are used, however - the hierarchy is not always clear. And there is less evidence that humans actually categorize polysemes in this way. In the case of bachelor, if you were given a set of pictures of seals, knights, college graduates, and swinging bachelors and asked to divide them into two piles, it is likely that the first cut would be in terms of $( + l$ --human). If asked then to divide the people pictures into

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

two groups, and if the pictures included women in college caps and gowns, it's probable that $( + i - m a l e )$ would be the next category. If there were no women in the pictures, this wouldn't happen, and the pictures of knights would probably be the next to be excluded. In other words, the hierarchy seems logical but it is difficult to find direct evidence that people actually break down terms into these components or that they would arrange them in the same hierarchy if they did.

# Practice 1.5

1. List as many words as you can that end with $y$ (as in kitty). What feature(s) do they seem to share as a consequence of the $y ?$ What label would you give to the feature(s)?   
2. How might you use Bolinger's early-late feature to teach words that contrast on this dimension?   
3. Although it is not difficult to make assertions about the underlying features of words, what evidence is there that learners pay attention to such things? Do we actually add up the features in order to arrive at a meaning? Does anyone consciously say, 'Okay, this is +noun, +animate, +human, +male, +unmarried, so it must be bachelor"? Whorf (1936) informs us that Hopi has one noun that covers everything that flies except birds. So a flying insect, an airplane, and even its pilot might be called masa'ytaka. Surely this seems no stranger to a Hopi than our use of bachelor to mean an unmarried man, an unmated male seal, a holder of the B.A. degree, or a knight in training! When we think of a bachelor friend, do we superimpose the seal or whatever else on our image of that person? Does the Hopi speaker consider flying insects and airfine pilots as similar in some way? Do developmental evidence and slip-of-the-tongue evidence outweigh such questions, or could the use of semantic features be nothing more than an analytic device?

In this chapter we have introduced the notion of semantic features and discussed some of the strengths and weaknesses involved in semantic feature analysis. Linguists working within other theoretical frameworks have tried to incorporate feature information (both distinguishers and markers) in their descriptions in more comprehensive ways. We will discuss these alternative approaches in subsequent chapters. First, however, we will look at semantic field analysis, a methodology which shares many aspects with the semantic feature approach.

# Research and application

1. Gillis (1987) traces the necessary move in child language from identification of individual objects by name to the comparison and the search for other exemplars. Language learning would be an impossible task if every object had its own name; the child must realize that deictic definitions (pointing: "it's a shirt') do not name individual items but rather refer to a class of like objects. Consider how Gillis's work might apply to children in a bilingual situation.

3. Wierzbicka (199l) demonstrates that English nouns are not simply singular or plural. She considers some nouns as dual, meaning that they form a semantic class of objects which have two identical parts, joined together and performing the same function. This dual noun class takes the quantifier "a pair of." The semantic class includes scissors, tongs, tweezers, forceps, and clothing (slacks, undies, pajamas). Prepare a research plan to investigate each of the groups she discusses using data from another language. You might consider using nonsense word items for bipartite objects to see whether children consistently use an -s form for one of each of the objects.

3. McCawley (1975) lists a number of examples where very similar nouns differ as to whether they are countable (or show individuation). For example, noodles can be counted in English but spaghetti cannot (though it can be in Italian). Other examples include garlic vs. onions; rice vs. beans; fruit vs. vegetables; cold, headache vs. flu, diarrhea, tuberculosis. McCawley claims that mass nouns are neutral as to individuation, whereas count nouns specify individuation. In the dictionary, noodle is defined as a thin strip of food paste, while pasta is defined as dough or paste made of flour and water. So dictionaries also recognize individuation. Check each of the terms (garlic vs. onions, and so forth) in another language to discover whether they are classified as mass or count in a way that corresponds or contrasts with English.

4. Miller and Charles (1991) investigated the type of ccntextual information that determines whether or not two words are semantically similar (i.e., synonyms). First, pairs of words (e.g., carautomobile, coast-shore, noon-string) were presented to native speakers, who judged the similarity of each pair of terms on a five-point scale. Second, they were asked whether each member of the pair could be used in the same context. To test this, Miller and Charles collected sentences that included the first word of the

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

pair and then colected sentences that included the second word of the pair. Then they deleted the pair of words and printed the resulting sentences on cards. The challenge for the participants was to sort the sentences according to which word fit. They found that pairs of words where either could be used in sentence contexts were also the pairs that were judged most similar. There were some items, however, judged as synonymous (e.g., carautomobile) that were not easily substituted for each other within certain sentence frames. If you teach a specific purpose English (ESP) class, select sets of words which have been presented as synonyms in course materials. Read Miller and Charles's study and design a study that would test the degree of semantic similarity of these terms. How would you apply the results to your teaching plans?

5. H. Buckingham, Jr. (1980) found that patients suffering from Wernicke's aphasia often substituted related words for the words they meant to utter. Look at the following examples and attempt a feature analysis of the substitutions (it will be difficult).

husband  wife, south - north, hot -- cold, nose - ear, hear -- talk, hear -- see, showed - saw, eat -- drink, write - read, green -- red, small - big, sister --- brother, hotter -- colder, summer -+ winter, Easter -- Christmas, sons -- daughters. "I sawed ( showed) you the picture, didn't I?" "I wish that girl would come back and see how my lights (- hearing aid) are reading ( working)." "The girl that was reading ( fixing) it, I wonder if the thing is reading (- working)."

Such data are used to validate the peychological reality of semantic features. If this topic interests you, review Fromkin's slip-of-thetongue examples (1971, 1973). Would error data from second or foreign Ianguage learners be useful as supporting evidence for this approach? Justify your answer.

# 2 Semantic field analysis

In the preceding chapter, we introduced the notion of semantic features. Initially, such features were used primarily to clarify polysemic meanings of words as in Katz and Fodor's (1963) fanous example bachelor. The analysis, however, has been extended and challenged in descriptions of semantic fields.

# Semantic fields

Semantic field analysis uses features to show the relationship of lexical items within a field or domain. For example, if we studied the word iron, we would also look at toaster, vacuum cleaner, and other items in the household tools domain. Or, we would study it along with copper, zinc, and other items in the metal domain. Because each field is examined separately, polysemy is not an issue (as it is in semantic feature analysis). Bachelor (as an unmarried rnan, a graduate with a B.A. degree, a person who serves a knight, or a sea animal) would be considered four different words and each defined within its own domain.

The classic example of semantic field analysis is that of kinship terms, an analysis which dates at least to the work of Kroeber (1909). He identified the following components in classifying kinship systems: generation, relative age within generations, consanguineal vs. affineal (sister vs. sister-in-law), lineal (father-child) vs. collateral (aunt-uncle), gender, kinsman and linking kinsman terms, and condition (alive-dead). This particular semantic field is especially important to field anthropologists in understanding and classifying family structures.

To illustrate the arguments about how semantic fields should be described, let us look first at a semantic feature description of the relationship among members of an immediate family. We know that some terms are $\mid +$ female): mother, sister, daughter, and others are $\langle + \ m a l e \rangle$ : father, brother, son. So gender is an important feature. Some terms are related according to generation: mother and daughter illustrate an ascending or descending generation feature. Figure 2.1 is a semantic feature diagram illustrating the field (we have arbitrarily used< ) brackets in the diagram). To follow the diagram, note that the items that are $^ +$ for a feature branch to the left and those that are - for the feature branch to the right.

![](img/e94087c1711576738e2f6e3655fcecba96b0841f0d200da9a23464915e1af324.jpg)  
Figure 2.1 Tree diagram for family relations (adapted from Kroeber, 1909)

There are several problems with Figure 2.1. First, it is unclear how the hierarchy of features is determined. Is gender the highest, most important feature in determining the place of items within the field? Or is the arrangement more a matter of aesthetic arrangement for the diagram? If the meanings are addirive, then we would start at the bottom of the tree and add each feature in turn to obtain the meaning of, say, daughter. A daughter is ${ \bf + 1 }$ generation, +descending, +generation, -male, kin member of the family. A sister is a nongeneration female kin member of the family. The sum of these features does not give a simultaneous interpretation that could be obtained by a more traditional list:

father mother brother sister son daughter

Brown (1965) uses three components to analyze eight kinship terms and places them in a diagram (Figure 2.2).

Displaying family organization in charts and then identifying terms for relevant relationships has the potential for misinterpretation if we hope to compare kinship groups across languages. For example, we have no separate terms for male and female cousin, yet we certainly view the distinction as important. Many other languages have distinct terms for male and female cousins. In Arabic, according to Marzouk and Ei Hindawy, there is also a special kinship term for two brothers who marry two sisters: They are 'adaayil. One brother is adiil to the other. The sisters are salaayif and one is the silfa of the other. When brothers marry sisters in the United States, they frequently get married on the same day, and their pictures are in the local newspaper, but there is no special vocabulary to distinguish them. The lack of a term does not make their relationship any less close than it might be in an Arabic-speaking society. The number of divisions, then, is determined by the languages being described.

# Practice 2.1

1. There are numerous anecdotes of young children asking for clarification of kinship terms: "What's a girl nephew?" "Spot's puppies, are they my sisters?" One child identified a cousin as someone you play with and who lives far away. When his best friend moved away, he asked, "Joe's my cousin now, isn't he?" Piaget's (1928) "brother" experiment addresses the issue of how children work through kinship terms. At stage 1, the child believes that brother and boy are synonyms and that sister and girl are too. Stage 2 children exhibit awareness that brother as a kin term requires that there be a sibling (a brother cannot be an only child). At stage 3, children not only realize that brother is a male sibling, but that the relationship is reciprocal. If you work with young children, prepare a research design which would help you elaborate on these tindings for other terms in the kinship field. If possible, include bilingual children in the project (or observe children who are native speakers of another language) so that you can see whether the stages are the same across different languages.

2. Ask young chiidren ot different ages tor their detinition of family. It is generally claimed that age and gender terms are important in the child's categorization of kinship terms and that only later does the child turn to family functions such as eating together. What do their definitions show you about the way these children view family and kinship terms? You might want to carry out a cross-cultural or cross-linguistic study by adding other groups.

3. Second language learners may also search for kinship terms as in this example from Butterworth and Hatch (1978, p. 429). Ricardo is a teenaged Spanish speaker newly immersed in an American high school.

# Example A

Ricardo: My uncle and esposa? GB: and wife.   
Ricardo: and wife and ninos? GB: Oh, and children.   
Ricardo: Yeh.

Example B

Ricardo: Brother of my, how do you say, my my uncle woman you know.   
GB: Your uncle's wife.   
Ricardo: Yah . . . woman is my uncle.   
GB: Oh, your aunt. Aunt.   
Ricardo: My aunt husband.

Look at your language textbooks. What kinship terms are taught? How many different terms are included, and how are these sequenced?

4. Prepare a self-instruction unit for yourself on these terms for the language you are leaming. As you begin to use the terms, check to see whether they are actually used in the same way as they are in your first language. Are they used as terms of address or only to refer to members of the family when talking to people outside the family? Does it matter if the relation is on the mother's side or the father's side? Does age make a difference in the terms used, for example, for older and younger brother? Is the relation term used alone or with a first name or family name? Are the categories strict or flexible? For example, is "aunt' used to refer to all temale friends of one's mother or only to the sisters of one's mother or father? Is "brother' used as a general term of address for all comparable age males of the group?

5. Select a workplace and list the work ralation terms. How many levels are there in the job title hierarchy? On what other dimensions do the titles differ (male/female, young/ old, experienced/novice, etc.)? When are job titles used as terms of address? Are they used more often in speaking of the person than as terms of address?

# Semantic field displays

Placing forms in a chart or a box of plus and minus features gives the description a very static quality. It also creates the impression that the words themselves contain these features rather than the impression that we assign words these features in order to comprehend or produce the terms. Linguists using semantic feature analysis traditionally employ trees, changing the table into a diagram that illustrates hierarchy. Compare Table 2.1 and Figure 2.3 for the semantic field of table settings.

The tree diagram gives us a better picture of the relationship of the terms within the field. In truth, though, it is a taxonomic arrangement, rather than an additive one. You do not add $^ { \star }$ setting +silverware to arrive at the meaning of fork. Instead, the tree diagram is probably interpreted as shown in Table 2.2, where a spoon is a kind of silver setting in a table setting and a pitcher is a kind of glass serving item in a table setting. The meanings are not additive. Instead, the taxonomy provides the logical basis for inclusion or exclusion in each category.

An example from Tyler (1978) may make these differences in approaches to analysis clearer. According to Tyler, we do not decompose words in a field into semantic features. We learn that an oak is a kind of tree (probably because someone pointed out a tree and said, \*That's an oak"). We do not think, "Let's see, an oak is a kind of tree because trees have trunks, and roots, and leaves, and are big, and an oak has a trunk and leaves and roots and is big, therefore an oak is a tree" (p. 194). All we need is to know that there are oak trees and have someone point one out to conclude that oaks are a kind of tree.

Another example of a semantic field is shown in Lehrer's (1969) comprehensive chart of the relevant features of culinary semantics (Table 2.3). A simplified version appears in James (1980, p. 93) with some of the semantic components for English and German. In the table, 0 means the feature does not apply distinctively one way or the other.

Although the semantic field is set up to look like a series of $+ 1 =$ semantic features, it is really a taxonomy, where the "kind of" relation is more fully specified. For example, frying is a kind of cooking that involves the use of fat in contact with a flame and it is not usually gentle.

The ultimate in taxonomy, however, occurs in classification in science, where it is important to give one, and only one, term to each distinct item and to place it in a hierarchical organization. Synonyms and homonyms are not acceptable in such systems. The systems people use do not follow those of science, so there is endless overlap and fuzziness in common terms for wildflowers, for birds, and for fish. The easiest way to drive a taxonomist crazy is to refer to all blue birds as bluebirds or all yellow flowers as daisies. Members of the Audubon Society who keep track of the types of different birds they have sighted go into shock each time a decision is made to change the names of birds. When two formerly different birds like Bullock's oriole and the Northern oriole are considered one bird (the Northern oriole), birdwatchers go through their record books and change the designations. And when one bird designation becomes two -- the brown towhee split to become the California towhee and the Canyon towhee - birdwatchers are delighted because it means they can add to their life list total one more bird they've seen!

1. Table 2.4 shows some of the words for footwear. Mark each tootwear word as $+ / -$ the set of features. What problems do you find if you interpret the table as an additive semantic feature analysis? As a taxonomy? Can you show hierarchy in either case? Can you show a basis for logical inclusion or exclusion in the overall structure of the field?   
2. Do a short tield analysis for various types of shirts: dress shirt, T-shirt, blouse, singlet, and so forth.

fook at for a static visual field and watch for a changing visual tield (Table 2.5). What other English terms can you think of for this semantic field? What correspondences do you find for these terms? If you are teaching or learning another language, prepare a similar chart. Then note how these terms are presented and taught (if they are) in your course materiais. Is this a semantic field?

4. Rhetoric manuals teach students to define by giving the term (e.g., "an oak"), then the class to which it belongs ("is a kind of tree"), and then its distinguishing features ("with. . . ." or "which has . . ."). Write a definition for each of the five footwear terms in Practice 2.2.1. Does the detinition make use of the features listed in the chart or are other features more appropriate?

5. Consider how you might draw a semantic field analysis of plant terms. Where would weeds go? It's been said that weeds are just plants that we don't want but get anyway. In French and Spanish weeds are called mauvaises herbes and ma/as hierbas (bad grasses). German uses

Unkraut (nonplant, not noncabbage). Do all languages (at least those that you can investigate) separate plants according to whether or not they have the feature (+wanted)?

# Evaluation of semantic field analysis

Semantic field analysis uses features to identify the relationship of lexical items within a field, with the goal of discovering how terms within the field or domain differ from each other. In semantic feature analysis, by contrast, the primary goal is to find those features that are distinctive, that have consequences for the grammar of the language, and that help to clarify the various meanings of a single word.

Since semantic field analysis uses a feature approach in relating items within a semantic field, the analysis inherits the problems we have already discussed for semantic feature analysis. First, are the features always either present or absent (plus or minus)? The problem of features that are present only sometimes is even more complicated in semantic field analysis. In semantic feature analysis, which is tied to the discovery of distinctions that have grammatical consequences, the features can more easily be described as plus or minus (though there are still problem areas). In field analyses, the features are distinguishers since they seldom have grammatical consequences. Even so, the features used in defining semantic fields are not always true dichotomies. Table 2.6, for example, shows buildings as a semantic field; many of the categories are not plus-orminus dichotomies. Depending on the school, it may or may not be a business. A mosque is a religious building, but it may or may not also be an education building. These can be left as neutral values, or some proportion might be assigned to plus and some to minus. Notice, too, that there is no feature in this chart that separates high school and institute. Another feature must be added as to level of instruction. No feature on this chart separates mosque and synagogue, so one more feature must be added. This highlights another difficulty with feature analysis: the numher of features needed to remove ambiguity from building terminology would have to be very large indeed. (For some semantic fields, the number is only one less than the number of items being disambiguated.) If par. simony is a criteria for theory, then this type of analysis suffers. In appli. cation rather than theory, however, such a detailed analysis of differences might be useful.

We have considered ways in which meanings are indexed first as general semantic features (distinguishers), semantic markers that relate to grammar, and finally semantic fields. As we have seen, the analysis in each case is basically taxonomic. Yet there are two problems with taxonomies. The first has to do with determining the hierarchical arrangement of items in the field. Given the building domain, should the terms first be split into private and public buildings? Should they be organized by size (small buildings, multistory buildings, skyscrapers), or should they be organized according to building materials (the three little pigs' straw house, stick house, brick house)? The initial and subsequent cuts are determined by our view of the domain. Many believe that taxonomic approaches just create lots of file drawers or pigeonholes into which forms can be slotted. This creates a feeling of order and neatness but leads to a second problem in that it obscures the process learners actually use in understanding words. In order to highlight a more process orientation, to get away from the put-it-in-a-box approach, linguists prefer to use tree diagrams. These diagrams suggest that the classification is not static but a series of choices made by the speaker to express meanings.

TABLE 2.6 BUILDINGS CHART   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Business</td><td colspan="2">Entertainmert</td><td rowspan="2">Religious</td><td rowspan="2">Gou&#x27;t</td><td rowspan="2">Education</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Wholesale</td><td>Retail</td><td>Performance</td><td>Social</td></tr><tr><td>Factory</td><td>+</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Shop</td><td>-</td><td>+</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td></td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Theater</td><td>-</td><td>+</td><td>+</td><td>-</td><td>?</td><td>?</td><td>r.</td></tr><tr><td>Pub</td><td>-</td><td>+</td><td>-</td><td>+</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr><tr><td>Mosque</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>+</td><td>^</td><td>c.</td></tr><tr><td>Synagogue</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>+</td><td>^.</td><td>?</td></tr><tr><td>Courthouse</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>+</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>City hali</td><td>-</td><td></td><td></td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>+</td><td>?</td></tr><tr><td>High school</td><td>-</td><td>?</td><td>^.</td><td>?</td><td>?</td><td>A</td><td>+</td></tr><tr><td>Institute</td><td>-</td><td>A.</td><td>r.</td><td></td><td>.</td><td>A.</td><td>+</td></tr></table></body></html>

This use of trees to suggest a series of choices has been criticized as well. The analysis may be descriptively interesting, and it may be diagrammed in a way that seems to reflect choice in langnage production, but there is little evidence that speakers actually process items by breaking them down into their component features. It seems quite unlikely that we match +human, -degree holder, +male, --married to arrive at bachelor or that we determine city hall as the right choice of the building semantic field by checking off the plus and minus categories listed in Table 2.6. We are not arguing that we never decompose words into their features in making lexical choices. We may do so in dealing with problematic use of words and we certainly do in giving definitions. Indeed, adult second Ianguage learners who approach learning in an analytic way may find such analyses very useful in determining not only the vocabulary of a domain but also the distinctions that are made in selecting one rather than another term in the semantic field.

These criticisms are not meant to negate the value of semantic field analysis. It is extremely important to begin an analysis with a listing of terms for a field. Once such a task is undertaken in a serious manner, the field may be divided into domains of related terms within the field. For example, Lehrer (1983), in examining how people talk about wine, found that experts and novices used a wide variety of terms that could then be grouped into a series of dimensions related to taste. These included acidity, astringency, age, body, balance, smell, finish, and whether it was active (still, gassy, sparkling, etc.). Terms that show an overall general evaluation included those of high praise (subtle, delicate, elegant, fine, complex), low praise (clean, refreshing, simple, sound), mildly derogatory (insipid, bland, ordinary), and strongly derogatory (off, ghastly, awful). By linking these various dimensions, the entire field of wine terms as used by a variety of people in many areas and of many levels of expertise, can be categorized and described.

Beyond the hierarchical arrangement of domains within a field, however, Lehrer's work is especially interesting because she shows, first, that contrary to popular opinion, there are many terms related to taste. Second, she demonstrates how the terms are negotiated in conversational interactions. For example, one group described a wine as:

A: Earthy!   
H: Mossy - like moss smells and tastes.   
E: Kind of flinty - that would be earthy -- Chablis. H: Yeah.   
E: Makes you think of pebbles or stones or something. \$: Minerally?   
E: Flinty.   
I:  I don't know about flinty.   
H: It's like metal.   
D: Metallic? It's not metallic.   
N: It has corners?   
E: Smell of an unburnt match?   
H: Smell of somebody's cellar, in a wet place.   
D: Musty or something.

(Lehrer, 1983, p. 108)

The negotiation continues at length, as the tasters not only offer taste terms but terms that affect taste (the smell, the feel of it in the mouth, and so forth). Lehrer's work, therefore, goes beyond field analysis to the relation of terms within a field.

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

Other researchers have proposed very different ways of describing the semantic relations among terms for a field. Lewandowska-Tomaszczyk (1990) uses a three-tier system to illuminate the characteristics that separate meanings. The tiers list features that are necessary, central, and typical of the terms. For example, humar would, of necessity, be a mammal. Central to the concept human is the ability to think, and the ability to talk is typical. For families of terms, such as furniture, the division into tiers might be:

Necessary condition: artifact   
Central condition: [function] for people to sit on, keep things in, etc.   
Typical condition: HAVE [surface] to sit on $=$ stool, chair to lie on $\eqcirc$ bed to sit or lie $\mathbf { o n } = c o u c { \ddot { t } } .$ tO put things $\mathbf { o } \mathbf { n } = t a b l e$ , desk HAVE [container] to keep things in with shelves for books $\eqcirc$ bookcases with rod or hooks for clothes $=$ wardrobe

This method bridges the work in semantic field analysis with that of cognitive psychologists such as Langacre, Clark, and Lakoff. Lehrer's extension of field semantics to relations overlaps the work of linguists and lexicographers who use relational models. We will turn to the more cognitive approaches in the next chapter as we discuss core semantics and prototype theory. Relational models will be discussed in Chapter 4.

1. Southworth and Daswani (1974, pp. 191-194) present diagrams of English, Hindu-Urdu, and Tamil language kinship groups. If you are interested in family structure, select another language, prepare a kinship chart, and show how similar or dissimilar it is to each of these languages.   
2. Wu (1990) examined the use of kinship address forms by speakers of Mandarin Chinese with non-kin. Although it has been said that speakers use these terms in addressing older people, Wu found they were also used in addressing juniors and even strangers. Prepare a research plan to investigate tle range of languages in which kinship terms are extended beyond the family. Is English in the minority in this regard?   
3. In the following excerpt (transcribed according to the conventions of conversational analysis), H is a Persian and M a Japanese student of English.   
H: Do you-do you spend uh (.4) some drugs $=$   
M: Mmhmm   
H: $\Bumpeq$ In your food?   
M: Mm hm (.2) ye:s $\asymp$   
H: $\lneq$ Like saffron, or salt, or pepper something like that?   
M: Mmhmm oh: I: see. Yes mum (1.0) Japanese?   
H: Yes, in Japanese food.   
M: O:h in Japanese food mmm Japanese food no:t spi-cy: (.2) almost $=$

M: mm example umm tabasuko? An uh, muhstad mm and pepper.   
H: Yes, I got it.   
M: Not spicy Japanese food. (.2) Very soft taste. (Data source: Schwartz, 1980)

Are spices a semantic field? Do the examples given in this excerpt match those you would supply? Why is drugs not an appropriate cover term for these items? What is the semantic relation between spice and drug?

4. Henley (l969) investigated the semantic field of animal terms (20 terms) using five experimental tasks (free listing, pair ratings for similarity, triad ratings, verbal association, and paired associates learning). Using multidimensional scaling techniques, she found that size and ferocity were the most important dimensions in the groupings of the animals. Why is this finding important as counterevidence to a semantic feature hierarchy or a semantic feld display approach? You might want to replicate her study in a language other than English to see whether a cross-linguistic task would obtain the sane resnlts.

5. Korfeld (l97s), in a case study of a retarded individual, discusses the responses of retarded individuals to commands such as, "Put the book on the chair." Instead of placing the book on the chair, they responded by picking up the book and sitting on the chair. What might this say about the power of the furniture semantic field? What other interpretations might one give for such a response?

6. Car terms are now said to be the most discriminated field in the United States. That is, asked to name cars, people can think of more names than they can for, say, vegetables or schools. Aronoff (1985) shows that the semantics of any American car name relates

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

to its position relative to other kinds of cars - each depends for its meanings on the other words in the semantic field. After you have read this analysis, select another product semantic field (perhaps refrigerators, washing machines, bicycles, dolls) and carry out your own analysis.

7. In working on taxonomies it has been noted that while seat has the subcategories of chair, bench, stool, and so forth, there is no simiIar cover term for things we climb on, such as ladder and step stool. There is no cover term for things that hold items together such as staples, paper clips, glue, and so forth. There is no word for things with teeth such as combs, rakes, and so forth. However. even without a cover term, we are easily able to group items together that go together. People can still sort cards into stacks that reveal the categories. Barsalou (1983) discusses the number of categories that we create on short notice: what to take out of the house in case of a fire, what to do on the weekend, or presents to take to a party. None of these have cover terms. Check these categories in another language. If you find a language that does have a cover term, design an experiment to compare how well speakers of this language carry out a card sort task compared with native English speakers.

8. To collect data on the lexicon of wine (and the ways people talk about wine), Lehrer gathered experimental data as well as conversational data during wine-tasting sessions. If you have found a lexical field that you wish to investigate, you might examine her methodology and analysis in detail. Can your data also be broken into domains (if so, what might they be)? Do you believe that experts and novices talk about the lexical field you have selected using very similar or very different sets of terms? Would your findings be useful to a language teacher? If so, specify how they might best be used.

# 3 Core meanings and prototype theory

Katz and Fodor, as shown in their analysis of the word bachelor, used a feature approach in examining the ways in which words with the same form but slightly different meanings are related. The intent of such analyses is to identify features that are critical, especially grammatically critical, in determining meaning. However, if you ask people for a definition of bachelor, it is unlikely that they will think immediately of an unattached male seal. Because no special weight is given to primary meanings in semantic feature analysis, we need another way to talk about meanings that will capture the notion that some meanings of a word seem to bc more central than others.

In trying to understand the ways in which we assign meanings to words, cognitive psychologists and linguists use two terms: core and prototype. Core (as opposed to periphery) relates to meanings of a particular word which are most central, primary, or invariant. The core meaning of break is that of breaking an object such as a cup, not the breaking of waves on the shore. A prototype is a best instance example of a concept. Thus, robin might be a prototype best instance of the concept BIRD and oak might be a prototype best instance of the concept TREE.

# Core meanings

Labov (1973) asks us to decide when we call a cup a cup, what the core meaning of cup is, and under what circumstances the core meaning is missing and the object is judged to be something other than a cup. If a cup has no handle, is it still a cup? If it is tall and made of clear glass and you serve Irish whiskey in it, is it a cup? If you drink tea in it, does that change your choice or is it now a glass? What if it is square and has no handle, but you drink coffee from it? What if it is tall, made of styrofoam, but has no handle? For most Americans, the core representation for cup is a handled container, about three inches high with slightly curved sides (width to height taper), made of earthenware china that is used to serve coffee. If we vary these dimensions or change the material from which it is made, use it for some other function (e.g., if we put flowers in it or hand it out as a prize at an athletic event), add a lid, or remove the handle, we have moved away from the core to a more periphera! representation. Beyond some

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

point, we may need to use a different word - glass, teacup, stein, vase, wine glass. When do we decide to use a different word? And are the dimensions and the cutoff points the same across languages?

Although most concepts used in discussing core meanings relate to objects, there are core meanings for verbs as well. For example, the word break has several meanings, but if you ask people to produce sentences with the word break, they will use the core meaning of an agent breaking a physical object such as a cup. If you ask people to produce sentences with the word put, it is likely they will use an example where an agent transfers a physical object to a flat surface. Core meanings of verbs are connected to their propositions.

Kellerman (1978), in his now famous study of breken in his comparison of Dutch and English and Dutch and German, has demonstrated that second language learners, once presented with the word for break in a new language, are more likely to believe that those meanings closest to the core ("the cup broke," he broke his leg") are those ro which the new word can apply. They are less likely to believe that the same word could be used for more peripheral meanings such as strikebreakers or icebreakers. Here are the senteuces that Kellerman used in his experiment. To determine which meanings were most central, he presented native speakers of Dutch with cards on which the following sentences (but not the translations, of course) were printed:

1. De golven braken op de rotsen. (The waves broke on the rock.)   
2. De lichtstralen breken in het water. (The light rays refract in the water.)   
3. Hij brak zijn been. (He broke his leg.)   
4. 't Kopje brak.(The cup broke.)   
5. Na 't ongeluk is hij 'n gebroken man geworden. (After the accident, he was a broken man.)   
6. Zij brak zijn hart.  (She broke his heart.)   
7. Hij brak zijn woord.  (He broke his word.)   
8. De man brak zijn eed.  (The man broke his oath.)   
9. Welk land heeft de wapenstilstand gebroken? (Which country has broken the ceasefire?)   
10. Sommige arbeiders hebben de staking gebroken. (Some workers have broken the strike.)   
11. Nood breekt wet. (Necessity breaks the law - a saying)   
12. Dankzij 'n paar grapjes was 't ijs eindelihk gebroken.  (Thanks to a few jokes, the ice was finally broken.)   
13. 'n Spelletje zou de middag enigszins breken. (A game would break up the afternoon a bit.)   
14. Zij brak 't wereldrecord.(She broke the world record.)   
15. Zijn stem brak toen hij 13 was. (His voice broke when he was 13.)   
16. Zijn val werd door ${ \bf \gamma } _ { \pmb { \Omega } } , _ { \pmb { \Omega } }$ boom gebroken. (His fall was broken by a tree.!   
17. Het ondergrondse verzet werd gebroken. (The underground resistance was broken.)

The native speakers of Dutch sorted the cards, ranking them on the centralness of the meaning of breken. This procedure allowed Kellerman to be sure that his own intuitions of coreness were correct. Next, he asked Dutch learners of English whether they thought the English word break could be used for breken in each sentence. Dutch high school and university students studying English or majoring in English read the Dutch sentences and predicted whether break could be used for breken in each. All learners were willing to use break when the meanings were closest to tbe core. Kellerman found a U-shaped curve where beginners and advanced students were most willing to use break in instances further from core meanings. Intermediate learners were less willing to use break in items far from the core. To explain this U-shaped curve, we might claim that advanced learners may have been exposed to the full range of meanings for break. Perhaps beginning students are more daring while intermediate learners are more cautious because they have found that expecting similar words in two languages to correspond can lead them into error.

# Polysemy and homonymy in core semantics

Polysemes are the many variants of meaning of a word where it is clear that the meanings are truly related. The verb break has many different variants which are related in meaning. The verb put also has an array of polysemes. Homonyms (sometines called homographs), on the other hand, are variants that are spelled alike but which have no obvious commonality in meaning. The classic example is the word bank, which could mean a financial institution or the bank of a river or a tier or row of objects (such as a bank of seats at a baseball game). These meanings are not noticeably related and therefore would be listed as three separate or distinct words with different meanings in dictionaries.

Jakobson (1972) claims that there is something invariant - a Gesamtbedeutung (a general meaning) that links even these separate entries. Jakobson uses the example of bachelor, as so many linguists had, to show that all of the meanings have in common the idea of an adult male (unless the context specifically specifies otherwise as in bachelor girl) with one item lacking in his life.

One question regarding core research is whether or not polysemes such as those shown in the break example really are the same word (whether there is some invariant Gesamtbedeutung that links them) or whether some should be listed as separate lexical items. The break of "break a

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

cup," "heart broken," and "icebreakers" share meanings. Some of these meanings are more central or corelike than others. The problem, then, is to work out some way of showing how central or corelike the meanings are and how they vary as they move out from that core. This has required the use of dimensions (we will turn to ways of talking about dimensions in the next section).

Polysemes and homonyms are of special interest in cross-dialect and sociolinguistic studies because some of the meanings of polysemes or homonyms may occur in only one of the dialects or be used by only a specific group in society. For example, when someone offers you a biscuit, are you being asked if you'd like a cookie or a baking-powder quickbread (a scone in British English)? Biscuit is a cross-dialect polyseme. An example of a cross-argot homonym would be words such as horse, snow, and tea when they are used in drug cultures to refer to drugs. These meanings are not, as near as we can tell, immediately related to their more common meanings.

# Practice 3.1

. Graham and Belnap (1986) used a technique similar to that of Labov involving pictures of various objects (cups. glasses, bowls, chairs, stools, benches, shoes, and boots) with varying heights, widths, and details (with or without handles, with or without shoelaces). They then asked native speakers of English and Spanish to name the objects in the pictures. The native speakers ot Spanish, who were learners of English as a second language, were also asked to nane the objects in English, with a week's time between their performance on the naming task in the two languages (half of the subjects did the task first in Spanish and half did it first in English). You might be surprised to learn that the dividing line for switching from one name to another (such as from cup to glass) was not always the same for the speakers in their two native languages, and the dividing line for the switch in English as a second language was often rmuch closer to the native Spanish dividing line. Try this experiment with the same objects in another language that you or your students know. What features (size, shape, details) seem to determine the point at which a switch to a different word is used for the item? Do leamers seem to change their dividing point when using their secord language?

2. Prepare a research plan to replicate Kellerman's procedure, but select some other lexical item, perhaps the verb stop or drop. Once you have drawn up a series of sentences containing different meanings for the word, ask native speakers to rate them in terms of core to noncore meanings. What core meaning(s) do you think you will obtain for the word? which do you predict will be judged as far from the core? Now find a word in another language that corresponds to this core meaning. Does that second language word correspond to the English word in all the examples? write out your plan for administering the items to English speakers learning the language. If you want to see if the U-shaped curve obtains for learners at different levels, what proficiency levels would you select? (l1f you decide to develop this exercise into a paper, you will want to read Shirai's [1990a] comments on methodology in his analysis of put and Jordens's [1977] study comparing core and peripheral meanings of words along dimensions.)

3. Look at various collections of contrasting lexical items in American English and British English. Decide which are cross-dialect polysemes and which are homonyms. Are polysemes more confusing to language learners than homonyms? Justify your answer.

4. Examine various monolingual dictionaries that you or your students use. See how the dictionary lists polysemes and homonyms. What factors did the editors use to separate polysemic meanings from homonyrns? Find several examples of words in the dictionary with both polysemic listings and homonym listings. Would it be easy for.language learners to recognize the reasons why some rneanings are listed under one main entry and others are listed under a different main entry? Justify your answer.

5. Is it enough to say that if no shared meanings are present, the word should be listed as a separate entry? Consider various jokes that play on polysemy or homonymy. Elephant jokes are a good source for these ('How do you get down from an elephant? You don't. You get down from a swan.") Other sources are newspaper titles ("Council puts brakes on bike path') and bumper stickers ("Education kitls by degrees'). After you have collected several exarnples, determine whether homonymy is required for all such jokes.

# Prototypes

The research literature in psychology (e.g., the 1983 research of Rosch and associates) shows that we definitely have shared ideas about what is the most prototypic instance - the best example - for many concepts. We all know what the color red looks like though we may find it difficult to describe. Given a series of color chips ranging in shades from purple to orange, we all could pick out the prototypic red chip, the best instance of red. And the chip we select would agree with that chosen by most other people as well. This is true across all language groups, even those that may not have a word for red (though almost all languages do). It appears that we interpret categories in terms of their clearest cases. Four claims have been made about processing and prototypes:

1. Items judged to be typical members of a concept can be categorized more efficiently than atypical ones.   
2. Typical members are learned first by children.   
3. Prototypes are named first when subjects are asked to give examples of members of a concept.   
4. Prototypes serve as cognitive reference points.

In the discussion that follows, you will see that these claims are generally true but that in some instances they can be questioned.

If you think about the concept BIRD, your best instance may have a different name depending on where you live, but it will capture most of the features that you associate with the concept. For most Americans, the prototypic bird is a robin (which is actually a thrush, quite different from the much smaller European robin). In this case, the prototype or best instance will vary from area to area. Obviously, the American robin is not a prototypic bird if you live at the South Pole. Yet, penguins would be very far from prototypic for most Americans. Thus, some prototypes are based in the human perceptual system (as in primary color terms) while others depend on location and cultural norms.

Whereas prototype research works with sets of words for a given concept, the discussions of findings vary as to whether we make an all or nothing judgment (i.e., an ostrich is or is not a bird), whether we make a graded judgment (i.e., an ostrich is a bird to a degree), or both (i.e., an ostrich is a bird but not a very good example of that concept). The latter appears most likely. Evidence in support of this can be drawn from other parts of the language. For example, we may use adjectives to show that a particular instance of an item varies from the prototype. A tall woman is a woman who is taller than our usual prototype picture of woman. We might also use adverbs. If we say, "The hoy threw the ball gently," the prototypic notion of force in throw has been weakened. So, we might consider forms such as compounds (compact car) as similar to other vocabulary choices (convertible) that vary away from or toward the prototype.

# Dimensions with prototypes and core meanings

Linguists and cognitive psychologists are concerned not just with identifying the prototype of any lexical entry, but with the dimensions along which others that fit in the concept group vary from the prototype. Similarly, researchers in core semantics have tried to identify the dimensions on which the secondary or peripheral uses of a word vary from that shown in the core or primary meaning. Perhaps this is why there is so much confusion of the terms core and prototype. Researchers within each tradition are looking for dimensions that capture variations from central meanings or central representations.

Many of these dimensions that have been identified have to do with natural experience, in particular with perceptual dimensions such as shape and size. The dimension of size and shape is shown in Figure 3.1 for the concept BIRD. This circle shows that the robin is the central prototype for bird. If we look in the next ring out we see birds of the same approximate size: sparrows, bluebirds, and so on. As we move toward the outer circles, size and shape change so that penguins and ostriches are judged much less birdlike.

There is at least one piece of evidence that validates relationship among items in the circle. Rips (1975) asked whether diseases could pass from one bird group to another. When the direction was'from a more prototypic to a less prototypic bird, the answer was yes. When the spread of disease was to be from the less toward the more prototypic birds, the answer was no.

While others used circle or wave diagrams to illustrate the range from most to least prototypic exemplars of a concept, Rosch et al. (1976) categorized meanings along two axes. The vertical axis arranges things from the most abstract form to the most specific: for example, tree to oak to California live oak. The horizontal axis arranges objects of the same level of abstraction by their attributes. In the following example, oak, sycamore, magnolia, pine, and aspen would all be on the same horizontal line. On the vertical axis, the point where objects share the most attributes is called the basic level. The levels above and below the basic level are called superordinate and sub-basic.

Superordinate: tree   
Basic: oak, pine, maple, elm .   
Sub-basic: California live oak, Lodgepole pine, Norwegian maple, Dutch elm .

![](img/14a5e34d0e5b318050d97c209cf7cbf41684f422865c6eb2725c19760f70bbd9.jpg)  
Figure 3.1 Circle diagram for the concept BIRD (from Aitchison, 1987, p. 54; used by permission)

A basic-level object name can usually be inserted into a sentence that contains a superordinate-level term and vice versa. For example, we can use the word sparrow for bird in the sentence "There are about a hundred birds on the telephone line." If we took a word from the sub-basic level to replace bird, however, the results might seem strange. " There are about a hundred golden-crowned sparrows on the line" seems odd because the focus is no longer birdness but ratber the astonishing fact that so many of these particular birds should be on the line. Obviously, our prototype of birdness includes the fact that prototypic birds sit on electric lines. Turkeys, penguins, eagles, hawks do not do this, of course. If we took an item from an even higher superordinate level, say animal, we would be unnecessarily ambiguous. "An animal on the line" could be a squirrel just as easily as a bird.

Again, this shows us that not everyone agrees on which dimensions are most important in determining prototypes. That is, visual similarities in size and shape may not be the most critical dimension in determining prototypes for all items. The most important dimension might be functional (a glass is something we drink from whereas a vase is not). They may involve motor activity (getting off a stool vs. getting up from a chair). They may involve purpose (we may sit on either a stool or a chair when writing). And variation from the prototype may be along a combination of several such dimensions.

# Superordinate, basic, and sub-basic levels

It has been suggested that learners acquire general basic-level items first. This has been contested for child first language acquisition. It is true that children learn the word cow, for example, before animal. But children also often learn the more specific sub-basic term before either the basic or the more general superordinate terms. Prior to learning pet, they are likely to learn dog. Prior to learning dog, however, they may learn the name of their particular family dog.

Nonetheless, evidence that basic forms may be easier can be found in evidence from language arts classes for young children. Hatch and Hawkins' (1991) data show that it is not difficult to get young bilingua! children to use less general, more specific noun choices. In writing down oral stories, these children revised, clarified, and specified their noun and adjective choices. They had great difficulty, though, in deciding if and when more specific verbs were called for. Strutting, shuffling, marching, and wandering are all more specific words for the central notion of walking; they mean a certain kind of walking. Children did not use these on their own, nor did they respond to suggestions that when they said "We ran so fast to the end" they could write "We sprinted to the end."

There are also examples of second language learners who have acquired highly sophisticated, sub-basic level terms for some concepts but who do not know very common, superordinate level vocabulary items even though they may be used in everyday speech. In studies of second language lexical development, we find examples of children learning specific level vocabulary very quickly if the terns cover an area of interest to them. For example, Miki, a $3 \%$ -year-old Japanese child acquiring English in the United States, used terms like hovercraft, submarine, and ambulance. According to Yoshida (1978), Miki was fascinated by vehicles,

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

wild animals, outdoor objects, and names of food and drinks, He used fence, bridge, ladder, parachute, cliff, and other sub-basic level terms. But, on the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Miki was unable to name common objects that were possibly not interesting to him, items like dress, skirt, ring, lamp - all basic level terms. Kenyeres and Kenyeres (1938) also noted with surprise that Eva, a Hungarian child becoming bilingual in French, acquired many unusual words yet did not know some of the most common French words.

If learners acquired basic level vocabulary first and highly specific vocabulary or superordinate terms later, we might logically expect them also to forget more quickly the highly specific and also the superordinate terms and to retain basic level words longer. Olshtain (1986), looking at the language loss of her child after they left the United States and returned to Israel, comments on the substitution of general for specific terms and gives the following examples of what the child said:

There's a lady going $\mathop {    }$ walking) in the park.   
The baby is putting ( $\dot { \mathbf { \eta } } =$ holding) up a spoon.   
I'm gonna wear hot. $l =$ warm) clothes today.   
She's walking to $\dot { } = \mathbf { \nabla }$ toward) the chair $[ =$ bench).

Our definitions of superordinate, basic, and sub-basic, however, are rather fuzzy, so it is not clear whether these are truly examples that support a levels hypothesis. We can argue that walking is moving in a particular way, a way that is neutral rather than goal-directed. It is a basic level term for movement. Going, too, is a basic level rerm under the superordinate term of moving; however, it is a goal-directed type of movement. What has been lost might be the distinction between goaldirected (moving toward a place) and nongoal-directed motion. Strolling would be the sub-basic term, perhaps, for walking. In each of these examples the terms used during this period of language loss are less specific than the target forms, but they also show the problems involved with trying to make the three-level dimension work for all descriptions. Ir still is not clear whether word loss is related to any of the preceding models. As Olshtain suggests, the kinds of vocabulary a learner acquires or forgets must depend, in part, on age, the learner's interests, methods of teaching, the amount of reading the learner does, and the amount and rype of social interaction experienced.

# Practice 3.2

1. What level is the word educator? List as many other terms as you can for each of the three levels ot this concept. How do they relate to each other? (Or do this for another word, perhaps sports, fruit, or English.)

2. Hawkins (Hatch and Hawkins, 1991) asked young bilingual children to consider alternatives for said in the stories they first told and then composed in writing lab. Noting their intonation in telling the story, students readily changed said to yelled or laughed, but did not use other forms such as exclaimed. One student was also unsure whether he could write, "But Long worried (said), 'There's a dog in the hall."" What forms do you predict your students would use in a siilar exercise? Work out a research plan to investigate related questions such as whether students revise their essays toward more precise vocabulary. If so, is this more obvious in the changes in nouns, adjectives, or verbs?

3. Sometimes it is difficult to decide what constitutes a basic Ievel. Consider all the different types of words you might use for seats (e.g., chair). Then list all the more specific terms for each of your words (e.g., high chair). That gives us three levels. However, we might think of a yet higher level, furniture. What would the basic and superordinate terms be for this term? If we can change levels (make chair a basic item for seat and a sub-basic term for fumiture), does this still support the hypothesis about what is learned first and best retained? What soluticn can you propose?

4. If you have data from a language classroom, look at the kinds of simplification teachers do in terms of vocabulary choice. When misunderstandings seem imminent, does the teacher switch to a basic-level item, a superordinate term, or a sub-basic term? When teachers give detinitions, do they use a superordinate term to define a basic-level term or offer another basic-level synonym? Compare your tindings with other "foreigner talk" papers (see Chaudron, 1983, 1988).

5. Oxtord's (1990) list of compensation strategies used by second language learners includes "adjusting or approximating the message' and "using a circumlocution or synonym." Listen to or record your learners as they speak in natural circumstances. When they do not seem to know a term, do they compensate by using a superordinate term and distinguishing oharacteristics of the thing they are trying to explain, do they try another basic-level term, or do they give several more specific sub-basic terms? Give examples to support your answer. Does the compensation strategy used seem to depend on the level of word the learner is searching for?

# Fuzzy categories, levels, and prototypes

Bolinger (1975, p. 205) said that "meanings are as elusive as a piece of wet soap in a bathtub." The same could be said about categories, levels, and even prototypes. The difference between prototype and core can be taken care of most easily. As explained earlier, the prototype meaning is the best instance, template meaning that speakers of a language think of when a concept is named. Prototype analysis is more psychological, perhaps, than linguistic. It is especially interesting when the prototype is universal, as it is likely to be if based on our perceptual systems as in the concept RED. An English speaker is unlikely to select a purplc or a pink or a red-orange color chip when asked to find the central red chip. Core meanings, on the other hand, are those which are most central for a set of polysemes (words with the same form but slightly different meanings). Work in core semantics focuses more on finding dimensions on which core meanings can differ in the periphery while maintaining a common base. Researchers in prototype theory also look for dimensions, bur usually they do so in terms of a hierarchy of superordinate, basic, and subbasic forms.

When we turn to specific examples with any of the analytic methods discussed so far, we encounter difficulty because words do not have meanings in and of themselves. The meanings are conventional, arrived at through consensus and context, and very "fuzzy." We have said that some terms, like color terms, are fairly consistent: the primary colors of red, yellow, green, blue, black, and white appear to elicit similar responses from people (responses which say something about our visual perceptual system). Of course, many languages have one name for both blue and green. This does not mean that they do not distinguish these two colors, but only that the distinction is not marked in the language. In some languages, such as Russian, there is a word (golboy) for light blue and another word (siniy) for dark blue. It is difficult to believe the prototypic blue is dark blue, but we do not have a word for light blue, the color many people think of for blue. Even though we would use blue to refer to these two colors, we still are able to distinguish between them visually.

The boundaries that result from the fuzzy union of two or more primaries are not so clear and color judgments vary. One example is trying to distinguish various shades of red in identifying wildflowers. Flowers that have much blue in the red are often called blue, and those with much pink may also be called blue. In fact, photography books contain discussions about the difficulty in photographing certain flowers because the film will not register the full range of colors present but read several as the same. This results in some very unred and unblue pictures of flowers in the red and blue sections in wildflower identification books.

Many languages distinguish between warm colors - such as yellow, orange, red, white - and cool colors - such as blue, turquoise, green. Others oppose dark colors, such as black and green, to light colors such as white and yellow. Ornstein and Gates (1964) note that cool vs. warm is an important distinction in Chinese for colors (and that there are different words for colors and for dyes). Ch'ing is the word for the cool colors: blue-green, grey-black. However, the color also comes from the words it is used with. Thus, ch'ing sky is blue, ch'ing mountains are purple, ch'ing grass is green, ch'ing cattle are black, and ch'ing horses are grey. The point here is that once we get beyond the primary color terms, the meanings of terms become fuzzy. The question, then, is whether it is the terms or our perception of reality that is imprecise.

This problem of dealing with fluid categories extends to semantic feature analysis. When we talked about opposites such as day and night in Chapter 1, we noted that it is only convention that sets the boundary line. Everyone knows that even very precise terms such as a minute can mean sixty seconds, but when used in an expression such as "wait a minute," it can be a lifetime. Baldinger (1980, p. 32) gives us a Spanish example of many resulting jokes about time. A philosopher says, "To me, 1,000 years is just a minute." Amazed, a peasant asked, "And 1,000 pesos?" "Like five centavos," the philosopher replied. "Then, sir," the peasant smiled, "please lend me five centavos." And the philospher replied, "In a minute."

Scientific, legal, and medical fields have struggled in the past to insist on precise terms. (Today, however, science is accepting more fuzziness. See Kosko and Isaka's article on "fuzzy logic" in the July 1993 Scientific American, for example.) You can see that in legal cases, pairs such as life-- death must be defined with great precision. Because there is no consensus, however, we struggle with each term. During confirmation hearings for the United States Supreme Court, norninees are asked about their interpretation of natural law -- law which is based on the notion that there is consensus about right and wrong - and the meanings of many such terms. Terms used by the United Nations and in international treaties must be precisely defined so that nations know to what they have or have not agreed. For example, what does aggression mean? What does open sea mean? Decisions which can threaten the world, one's life, or one's health depend on definitions having precise consensual meanings.

Finally, there is fuzziness in what constitutes the dimensions on which words vary in meaning from the prototype concept. We have already noted that the prototypic bird might be a penguin at the South Pole and a robin in the United States. The prototype for tree might be a palm tree in Hawaii, but not in the rest of the United States. The prototype for a musical instrument may be a guitar for a teenager or a harp for residents of heaven. The variability and the fuzziness of changing prototypes are sources of fascination for all of us who love languages and language learning but a source of frustration for those who would prefer meanings, like bars of soap, to hold still long enough for us to capture them.

# Practice 3.3

1. List as many words of physical geography as you can think of (from little mounds to the highest mountains) in a Ianguage of your choice. Diagram them in some way. Once you have decided on your diagram, give the words in random order to native speakers and learners of the language. Ask them to rate them in terms of height, volume, and whatever other features seem to be important. How much agreement do you find? Then, make up a sentencelevel multiple-choice test offering the three closest choices from your list. How fuzzy are the boundaries when the words are put in sentence context?

2. Italian, Japanese, and Arabic all have three different terms for the color biue, one for light blue, one for royal blue, and one for navy blue.

Light blue Royal blue Navy blue Italian: celeste azzurro blu Japanese: mizuiro ao kon Arabic: labany azra' kohly

(Data source: V. Chimienti, M. Shinohara, and F. EI Hindawy)

Perhaps these different words reflect the color of the sky. water, and night. Add examples from other languages you might know. Are these categories fuzzier or more precise than our light blue, medium blue, and dark blue?

3. In the Olympics, scores for events such as diving, figure skating, and gymnastics are computed to three decimal points, and winners may be separated by as little as .012. This makes the ratings seem like precise scores. It is possible, too, to grade students' compositions in this way, turning grades into precise numbers. How fuzzy are such ratings in reality?

4. List as many words for dwellings as you can. It is said that people agree that hut, house, and mansion clearly differ, but the boundary line for words between each term is fuzzy. How clearly can you separate all the words you have listed? Repeat this exercise in another language of your choice. What comparisons can you draw in terms of clear or unciear boundaries?

# Research and application

Core meanings

1. In Chapter l, we noted that children use perceptual features such as shape, texture, and sound before others such as function. Andersen's (1975) study showed that children younger than 6 years of age use shape and material to identify cups and glasses. Later they discriminate these items according to function. Validate this study with children acquiring a different first language or a second language.

2. Dillon (1977) claims that young children learn the word hammer via both form and function and wonders whether they transfer this double form and function categorization to all tools. He also notes that polish is a difficult word for young children to learn because its mearing is primarily that of function. Young children often call shoe polish paint. If you are able to observe young children, work out a research plan to investigate this division of function and other formal features in the acquisition of lexical items.

3. K. Williams (199l) analyzed the Hausa words ci (eat) and shaa (drink), which are used for a much wider range of meanings than in English. Williams suggests that the extension of the meanings are radial in nature from the core meanings. Ci has a meaning in the sense of consume and we might use it in English in the way it is commonly employed in Hausa (e.g., "eat up the profits," "fire ate up the house"), but it also extends to a meaning of seize in winning a war, taking a town, or winning a race. After reading this article, try to find parallels in other languages for the nine extensions for ci and the four for shaa.

4. Coseiu (l967) demonstrates various ways of displaying relations among polysemes for the German word Schall. After reading this article, decide how each display gives shightly different information. Select a word from your own first language and diagram the relations in each of the ways demonstrated in this article. Decide why each method is or is not useful in teaching this vocabulary item to language learners.

# Prototype meanings

5. Battig and Montague (1969) gave university students 30 seconds to list examples of words for 56 categories. They then took the most

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

frequent examples to be the prototype for the category. The prototype vegetable, for example, was carrot, pea was second, and corn was thurd. Read this study and replicate it with students of different first languages or with your ESL/EFL students. Analyze the data and compare your results with those of Battig and Montague. To update your paper, fit your results into a discussion of prototype research.

6. Rosch (l973) took six items that ranked from high to low in frequency in the Battig and Montague study and.asked students to rank these on a seven-point scale of how well they exemplified the category. Thus, Rosch validated the notion that the most frequently mentioned item would also be the best exemplar or prototype for the category. After you have carried out the research suggested in item l, you might also want to carry out this vahidation procedure.

7. Levenston and Blum (1977) found that their adult learners of Hebrew first acquired common basic-level terms. The basic terms cover a fairly wide field (car covers many types of cars). These Hebrew learners then overextended the basic terms to other levels (e.g., used the Hebrew equivalent of car for all vehucles). Is such overextension common for beginning language learners regardless of what language they may learn? How might you research this question?

. Rips et al. (1973) showed that when people are asked to judge the similarity between all possible pairs from a set of animal concepts (e.g., lion-dog, lion--hawk, dog--hawk), the judgments have to do with distinctions such as species membership (fish are judged as similar to other fish and dissimilar to birds). However, people also make distinctions based on notions such as ferocity. A hawk might be judged similar to a shark because both are fierce. Such notions also help predict how quickly we can determine whether a stimulus word is a member of a superordinate category such as bird. Birds have a prototypic value for qualities such as ferocity. Those birds that most closely approximate prototypic values for these dimensions are more quickly assigned to the bird category according to McClosky and Glucksberg (I979) and Smith et al. (1974). Would second language learners make the same similarity judgments as native speakers? Are the prototypic values for critical dimensions the same across language groups? Barsalou (1985) found that when people were asked to assume a cultural perspec. tive ("If you were American, African, or Chinese, - . .), their ratings of birda shifted. Are the ratings of people who assume a perspective likely to be the same as members of that cultural group? How might you research these questions?

9. In Chapter l, we noted that definitions giving functions are evaluated lower than those giving features of the word or a superordinate term. Thus, the definition of a tricycle "you ride on it"' would be rated lower than "it's a three-wheel vehicle." Usually skills learned later are thought to be more advanced. In Andersen's study (item 1), children did not use function to distinguish meanings as early as they used the perceptual features of shape, texture, and sound. Dillon's study (item 2) suggests that the words themselves determine whether or not function will be used. What do the studies suggest about the value of function in definitions? How might you develop a rating scale to evaluate definitions in a way that weighted superordinate- and subordinate-level information with attribute and function information?

# Relationel models in semantios

The goal of semantic feature analysis is to discover a set of features that make up the meanings of words. In this analysis, two lexical relations -- synonyms and antonyms - are important because words related in these ways share features. Antonyms share features with the exception of one wbere the feature is negative rather than positive in value (e.g., hot and cold are related although they are at opposite poles of degree of temperature). Synonyms also share features, usually varying in terms of collocations or register rather than in meaning. (For example, entity is a formal synonym of something. We might say "bring something," but not "bring entity" or, conversely, "the entire entity" but not "the entire something.")

The goal of semantic field analysis is to arrive at meanings shared by a group of words in a domain. That is, all the words within the field relate to each other, yet differ in details, which are captured in the analysis. Thus, kinship and furniture are each a semantic field including a group of related words. The analysis reveals the structure of the semantic field.

In core semantics, the many meanings of a single word are related by defining the most invariant, central meaning and the spread of usage of the word along dimensions which move meaning from central to peripheral uses. Prototype semantics identifies the best instance word for a concept and then identifies other words that vary in some way from the prototype. The prototypic tree might be an oak. In terms of relations, a tree is a kind of plant, an oak is a kind of tree, and a black oak is a kind of oak. In prototype analysis, this relation is discussed in terms of superordinate, basic, and sub-basic levels.

Each of these analytic approaches highlights relations which are important in substantiating the analysis and ignores others. This lack of scope has been one of the major criticisms leveled at each analysis. In addition, each is illustrated with selected examples (e.g., bachelor, kinship, break, bird) rather than applied to ali the words in the lexicon - again, a lack of scope. As soon as we broaden the scope to all words, other relations emerge as important.

The goal of relational semantics is not to identify meanings of words but to identify the semantic relations between them. Whereas other models treat relations in an implicit manner, the goal of relational models is to make the relations explicit. If you were given the word farm and asked to offer word associations, you would likely name buildings $( b a r n )$ equipment (tractor), animals $\{ c o \mu \nu \}$ , crops (wheat), and people (farmer). You might associate the word with other rural (ranch) or city (town) terms. You might produce clang responses -- words that rhyme (harm) or words beginning with the same sound $( f u n , f a l l )$ . Each of these associations relates to the word farm in some way. Relational models attempt to identify all the types of relations in meanings that can be obtained between words. (Therefore, they will not include clang responses since such words are related through their phonological form rather than through meanings.) Those interested in language teaching acquisition immediately want to know whether this approach can help us understand how learners build a network of meanings that can be easily changed over time. After all, understanding acquisition means understanding the ways we organize our semantic knowledge of the new language and how the information is reorganized to accommodate the new material encountered in each succeeding language lesson.

The relational approach has evolved primarily out of the work of Russian and Polish theoreticians, particularly that of Apresjan (1969), Ilson and Mel'cuk (1989), Mel'cuk and Zholkovsky (1970, 1984). These theorists believe that semantic theories must be encyclopedic (i.e., have coverage similar to that of a dictionary and a thesaurus). To give a better notion of their work, let us turn first to a few of the relations identified in relational models.

# Types of relations

# Converse relation

If you ask people to say the first word that comes to mind when they hear the word teach, they are likely to say learn. Such pairs are neither synonyms nor antonyms. The words have a converse relation. This important mutual relation is linked to the script or scene in which they occur (we discuss scripts in Chapter 7). Teacher-student are converse roles in a classroom script. Teach-learn are converses related to roles in that script. Clerk-customer are converse roles in a service encounter script, and buy-- sell relate to these roles in the script. Tenant-landlord and rent to-rent from are converses in an apartment leasing script.

In some linguistic and logical analyses, the interpretation of a reciprocally related set of terms is rather strict. First, it is assumed that the converse relation is centered in verbs. Borrow-lend, buy-sell, likeplease refer to the same action, but the focus is on the borrower-lender, the buyer-seller, the person who likes--the person or object that pleases.

A second assumption is that one member of the pair implies the other (implicature). Thus, if someone buys something we can assume something was sold. If we say that we borrowed something, we imply that something was lent. In some cases, the reverse implication also holds. If we sold something, someone bought it; if we lent something, someone borrowed it. In these double implicatures, the meanings of the verbs reflect one and the same event. In a sense, they are synonyms for an act except that the form changes with the shift of focus to the person or object that carries our the action.

A third assumption in a strict analysis is that the converse actions take place at the same time or moment. Temporal unity is illustrated in sell and buy. The verbs describe the simultaneity of transfer of ownership. The same event is seen from two different perspectives, that of buyer and seller.

If we take this strict analytic stance, we are left with many pairs which seem to be converses but do not meet the criteria. Sergei Dobrichev (personal communication) suggests that we call such pairs pseudoconverses. Let's look at some of these pairs. The nouns buyer-seller are in a converse relation but they are not verbs. However, we can link each to the appropriate verb: the seller sells and the buyer buys at the point where money and merchandise change hands. We also see a converse relation between pairs such as ask-answer even though the actions do not take place at exactly the same time (e.g., asking and answering occur in succession, not simultaneously). We also want to classify ask-answer as a converse even though the implications about action and role focus only works in one direction. Answer presupposes that someone asked something. But ask does not automatically imply an answer.

If we discard the assumptions of strict analysis, we can lisr many pairs of words as having a converse relation. In doing so, however, we encounter new problems. For example, we may accept noun pairs such as doctor-patient as converses without being certain as to how they are linked. The converse relation of the roles seems to be that the doctor offers medical assistance to the patient and the patient receives the assistance from the doctor. We may also intuitively feel that doctor-nurse go together in a converse relation because the nurse assists the doctor and the doctor receives assistance from the nurse. However, since they are working together, rather than in a converse relation, to treat the patient, assigning a converse relation to their roles seems less than satisfactory. The relation is not between a pair (doctor-nurse) but among three roles (doctor-nurse-patient). In such cases, the relation may, indeed, be better labeled a pseudo-converse or assigned to a different relation (in some analyses it is called a contrast relation).

# Hyponym relations

Another relation is shown in the utterance "Lupine is a kind of wildflower." Lupine and wildflower are not synonyms. This "is a kind of" relation is calied hyponymy. (In some relational models it is called generic or taxonomic.) Because lupine is a kind of wildflower, wildflower has a generic, taxonomic, or hyponym relation with lupine.

The hyponym relation is one that we have already seen in Chapter 3. In discussing Rosch's categories of superordinate, basic, and sub-basic levels, we noted that there may be more than three levels and that this is a problem for the superordinate-basic-sub-basic classification. Each level, however, can be defined in terms of the hyponym relation: a desert lupine is a kind of lupine, a lupine is a wildflower, a wildflower is a kind of flower, a flower is a kind of plant. In relational models, levels are not named; instead, the relation is identified as that of hyponymy. Desert Jupine has a hyponym relation to lupine, lupine has a hyponym relation to wildflower, and so forth.

Verbs, too, can be related through hyponymy. Kastovsky (1990) notes that HIT has the hyponyms kick, punch, slap. But thesc words are also linked to specific instruments that do the hitting: foot, fist, paim. So, more than one relation is needed - an instrument relation along with the hyponym relation forming a network of semantic relations among the words. There are many other possible instruments for HIT verbs but most of them apply to hit (with a club, hammer, etc.).

The hyponym relation is an important relation in writing semantic descriptions, as well as in terms of memory for words. MacLeod (1976) asked students to learn number-word pairs, such as 56-car. Later, when students were asked to recall the pairs, some were forgotten. New words were then substituted for those that had been forgotten. If the new word related to the forgotten word, there was some residual memory (savings) of the first word although not enough to allow the student to recall it. The strongest savings were found when hyponyms were used. So if the original pair was 56--car, the students remembered the new pairs if they were 56-vehicle or 56-Buick. Buick is a kind of car and car is a kind of vehicle. Little recall was found for antonyms or synonyms (56-car and 56-auto) or associates (56-car and 56-truck).

# Part-whole relations

Most discussions of the part-whole relation identify it in terms of examples like chapter-book or wheel-bicycle. Iris et al. (1988) did a KWIC (key word in context) search of definitions in the computerized version of Webster's Seventh Collegiate Dictionary and found many part-whole relations in definitions. Examples such as \*Pedals (wheels, handlebars)

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

are part of a bicycle" show a relation where the part contributes to the whole, not just as a structural unit but as an essential element for the purposeful activity of the whole. Iris et al. found that this functional partwhole relation was by far the most common part-whole relation in definitions.

Some examples drawn from these dictionary definitions emphasize parts which can be detached quite easily (though the unir will no longer function): "drum is a part of a machine," "disk is a part of a plow." Other part-whole examples, such as "flame is a part of fire" and "flesh is a part of fruit," are not pieces that can he readily detached. Iris et al. found that some part-whole relations are temporal sequences ("hour is part of a day," "episode is part of a series"), some are spatial sequences ("front is the forward part or surface," "height is the highest part"), and still others are evaluative ("fat is the best or richest part'). Given the variety of partwhole relationships, one could argue that this relation might need to be subdivided according to type.

# Grammar relations

In word association literature, we often find responses that are grammatically related. Young children are said to go through a stage where they treat word association games as though they were requests to complete the sentence. Therefore, a stimulus word such as brush might be responded to with teeth, the stimulus word black might be responded to with horse. Responses that are related in this way are catled syntagmatic responses. Adults are much more likely to give paradigmatic responses, responses that are the same part of speecb (e.g., black-white, brushbroom).

Words may also be lexically related in ways that seem to be syntactically motivated. The words sing and singing are lexically related; the words sing and song are lexically related in ways important for syntax. Language learners, especially those in the early stages of learning, are likely to give syntagmatic responses and related forms of the same word. Meara (1978, 1982) has shown tbat language learners give more syntagmatic responses, more lexically related words, and more clang responses to words tban do native speakers. This has led to the claim that word associations of foreign language learners are similar to those of child first Ianguage learners. This hypothesis is not well substantiated once we look at the associations of bilinguals or advanced language learners (see Singleton & Little, 1991, and Soderman, 1993, in the Research and Application section).

In semantic feature analysis, we noted that linguists were primarily interested in features that have consequences for grammar. Relational models do this by including a separate description of grammatica! patterns (see the next section). However, they also highlight lexical relations among words (as in the sing-song examples) and semantic relations that work along with the grammar component. The semantic relations that are related to syntax include such relations as imperative, permission, causative, and minus-and-plus relations.

In Mel'cuk's system, Imper is the lexical relation imperative. We know what imperative means in terms of grammar. We are less aware, perhaps, of imperative as a semantic relation between words. The lexical relation of the words care and watch out! or between quiet and shut up! is one of imperative. As you can see, the Imper relation is not assigned like a feature to a lexical item; rather it identifies the relation between the words. Perm is the relation of permit or allow. The relation between go and let is one of permission. Caus is the lexical function of cause. The words sit and set are lexically related by Caus. That is, set relates as causing to sit.

Some relations have to do with quantity and quality. Quantity and qualiry are important in grammar because they determine forms used in comparatives and superlatives. In semantic relations, howevet, it is the relation between words that is important. Quantity and quality are shown by the relations Plus and Minus. Grow is a verb with a Plus relation to joy (e.g., "Her joy grew by leaps and bounds") and drop is a verb with a a Minus lexical relation to temperature (e.g., "The temperature dropped").

Many other relations would be needed to ensure the type of encyclopedic coverage that relational models hope to demonstrate. As researchers work on enumerating these, two problems emerge: the need to label the relations consistently and to identify correctly the total number of relations required. While each researcher is free to label relations as he or she wishes, some consensus is evolving on terminology. The number of relations also varies from description to description, and if there are a large number, then the enumeration is of little value for theory. (Remember that in semantic feature analysis, linguists concentrate on semantic markers, those with importance for grammar , because it would be impossible to identify all the features needed to distinguish the meanings of words.) In relational models, the claim is that only some small number of relations will be found. The question still holds: Will it be possible to find a small set that can account for the semantic connections among all words in a lexicon?

# Practice 4.1

1. List your first four word associations for the following words: book, piano, table, magazine, teeth, blackbird. Identity as many relations as you can among each set of four words. How many have a synonym relation? How many have an antonym relation? Because we have just discussed three semantic relations (converse, hyponym, and part-whole), your responses may have been biased by that discussion. How many of the words show these relations?

2. List a word with a converse relation for each of the following roles: coach, speaker, host, author, prosecutor. Identify the verb action that relates each pair of terms. Now translate these roles to another language. Are the associated converses the same across these languages?   
3. Doctor and patient are converse roles because the doctor offers treatment and the patient receives treatment. Doctor-nurse is a pseudo-converse because, although the nurse offers the doctor assistance and the doctor receives the assistance from the nurse, bcth are really treating the patient. We could make up a scenario where judge and jury would be converses (e.g., the judge instructs the jury and the jury is instructed by the judge.) However, the judge and jury together judge the person accused of a crime. The first two members in each ot these examples is a pair in relation to the third member. Can you think ot other examples where this type of three-way relation holds?   
4. What is the relation of junk food and potato chips? Ot ice skates and skates? How does the relation differ from that of synonymy? List additional examples for this relation.   
5. Iris et al. identified a part-whole schema where the relation implies the removability or divisibility within a segmented whole. Examples include "a slice of bread," "a piece of pie," "a handful of sand." In the first two cases, the part has a predetermined size and shape, but in the third it dces not. List three additional exampies of this type of part-whole relation. Can the same partition of the whole be found for these examples in another language?   
6. Taxoncmies carry all the information we described earlier with tree diagrams and graphs as field semantics. Examples of items related in this way include meat (beet, pork), fruit (apples, oranges), vegetables (peas, beans), all of which are subsets of food. Iris et al. assign such examples to the part-whole relation. Do you agree with this classification? Reread the section on the part-whole relation and Practice 4.1.5. What subgroupings would you use for all. the examples given by Iris et al. for the part-whole relation? Justify your answer.

7. Channell (1990) believes that it is more important to teach language learners paradigmatic associations (words that are the same part ot speech such as pencil-pen, wash-- soak, important-crucia/) than to offer syntagmatic associations such as pencil-write, wash-clothes, soak-stains, important--date, crucia/-point). Do you agree? Justify your choice.

3. Meara (1990) and others have described the mental organization of L2 words as more phonologically organized. Learners give more clang responses (e.g., farm-harm) than native speakers. They also offer associations that show they mistook the stimulus word for a phonologically related word. English students studying French, in French-English word associations, might respond anima/ to the stimulus word beton, confusing beton with bete. Or they might respond essayer to traire (to milk) based on its similarity to English try. Meara also notes that learners give more syntagmatically related forms (wash-clothes type responses), and that their responses are more loosely organized (they give a wider range of responses than L1 speakers). Assuming this is true for beginning and intermediate students, how might you use such insights to prepare vocabulary materials for these learners? which relations would you emphasize (grammar relations, soundalike words, words loosely organized around a topic)? Beginning and intermediate learners also give synonyms, antonyms, converses, and so forth just as native speakers do. Would you therefore want to emphasize these more than the syntagmatic, clang, or loosely associated relations? Justify your answer.

# Relational models

In the United States, relational models have gained importance as computer scientists have tried to find ways to help computers "understand" text. To do this, computers need to understand the overall "script" or "scenario" and the organization of text within that script. They also need to understand the semantic relation of words within the text. Computerized dictionaries already exist. The problem of how to make the dictionary one that will allow for automatic reading of relations of meanings in text, however, is immense.

It is not surprising that the mnost promising semantic analysis for computer scientists would be one that tries to work with relations among all

# Vocabulary, semantics, and Ianguage education

words of the language rather than analytic methods that only use illustrative examples. The problem is finding a complete set of relations and a dictionary that uses such categories. Different researchers use different terms for the relations, and most make no claims about the completeness of the set of relations they use. Because it is the most complete, many computer scientists involved with natural language processing have adopted the relational models of language of Mel'cuk and Zholkovsky (1970, 1984) and Apresjan (1969), who regard the dictionary as the basic foundation of theoretical linguistics. For them, language is the lexicon, the inventory of its words and relations and ways of combining them. (Within this view, grammar is primarily a means of expressing generalities that arise from the lexicon, a convenient way of decreasing the bulk in the lexicon. The view of most American tinguists is exactly the opposite; that is, the function of the lexicon is to support the grammar and reduce the length of lists of exceptions to grammar rules.) Mel'cuk, Zholkovsky, and Apresjan call the theory they work with the Meaning-Text Model (MTM) of language. The theory attempts, first, to cover relations among all the words of the language. Mel'cuk believes that this can be done with just fifty-two relations.

In Mel'cuk's model there are fifty-two different relations. Some are relations typically found in dictionary and thesaurus entries - synonyms, antonyms, and converses. A sample of Mel'cuk's relations is shown in Table 4.1. We have not included all fifty-two relations because some of them are lexical rather than semantic relations (e.g., dog-doggy, songsing, fear-fearfully); such relations are covered in Part II of this book. Other relations include both semantic and syntactic information (e.g., the relation Labor is a relation which requires the entry to be a secondary object: Labor $\{ e s t e e m \} = h o l d ;$ i.e., $\mathfrak { a } \mathfrak { x }$ holds Y in esteem"). Only relations that are clearly semantic in nature are included. The list is adapted from Frawley's (1988) discussion of relational models and metascience (a similar list with different examples appears in Evens et al. [1980, pp. 74-77]).

Although identification of relations is the first goal of the analysis, the MTM model goes beyond the exhaustive identification of relations to deal with the issue of choice among synonyms in particular contexts. The theory addresses differences in denotative and connotative meanings, in evaluative meanings, and in kinds of associations or in emphasis among synonyms. The MTM model also considers kinds of similarities that exist hetween synonyms (i.e., exact similarity or neutralization of differences in certain contexts), an issue of particular importance for language translation.

It is difficult to believe that only fifty-odd relations will be needed to provide all the information relevant to the semantic relations among words (other linguists working with relational models have proposed somewhat different numbers and types of relations). These theoreticians

are developing the model in a practical way, through the development of special dictionaries.

# Practice 4.2

1. Identify the name ot the relation  Anti, Minus, PIs, Conv, Syn, Perm, Sres -- between each pair of lexical items.

temperature drop wax wane notice announcement excuse leave fire ashes teach learn

2. Give an additional example for each of the following relations between lexical items. Which of the relations do you think are important for grammar and which for other semantic categores?

A (typical adjective) suspicion-tull of   
Bon (standard praise for word) advice-sound   
Centr (center of) city-heart   
Excess (excess functioning of item) eyelid-flutter   
Incep (the beginning of) fly--take off   
Fin (the end' or stopping of) fly-land   
Mult (regular aggregate of item) paper-ream   
Prox (to be on the verge of) war--on the brink of   
S (typical noun for participant) crime-victim, burglar   
Son (to emit a typical sound) bird-tweet

3. Select a paragraph from a reading in one of your language teaching textbooks. Circle three words in the paragraph and identify the relation between each word and another word in the paragraph or another word in the dictionary (that applies to the meaning of the word in the text). If you were asked by a student to supply a meaning for each of these three words, how might your detinitions make these relations explicit?

4. Now list three different words from the same reading and give a possible synonym. Are the meanings exactly the same or are there certain contexts where only one of the pair would be acceptable? What differences can you identify in terms of denotation and connotation for the terms? How important would these differences in denotation and connotation be if you were to translate this passage into

another language that you know? In your own words, explain why it is important that the MTM theory include denotation and connotation information for synonyms.   
5. Practice 4.1.8 focused on the types of relations you would emphasize if you were preparing vocabulary materials for beginning or intermediate students. Review the list of relations given in this section and identify those relations which you would include in such teaching materials. Justify your selection.   
6. Some relational semanticists divide relations into minor and major groups. The major groups include taxonomy (hyponomy), modification, synonymy, antonymy, and grading. These semanticists found that the part-whole, cause, and space and location relations were used somewhat less in their data. Does this intormation change or reinforce your view of which relations should be included in instruction?

# Relational models in dictionaries

Piotrowski (1990) cites the English-Russian Synonym Dictionary (Rozenman et al., 1980) as a beginning attempt to develop and test the MTM theory of lexical relations. The dictionary includes an appendix that discusses theoretical issues within the MTM framework. It has 400 items drawn from Webster's New Dictionary of Synonyms, including only abstract words - those that have to do with processes, states, properties, situations, and activities. Thus, the focus is on verbs and adjectives which are, perhaps, the most difficult to define - a good test for the mmodel. The synonyms are presented in groups, and each group is discussed in five sections: definition, meaning, collocations, grammar, and illustration. A typical entry might be four pages in length.

The definition section includes only the meaning that is shared by all the synonyms in the group. This meaning is called the semantic invariant. (Because this is a bilingual dictionary, the definition is followed by a list of Russian equivalents so that it is possible to do a rough comparison of synonym groups in the two languages.)

Next, the similarities and differences in meanings of particular synonyms are given in terms of semantic relations. The differences and similarities follow the theory by answering the question of whether there are differences in (a) denotation meanings, (b) evaluative meanings, (c) kinds of associations or connotations, and (d) in emphasis, and what kinds of similarities (exact similarity or neutralization of differences in certain contexts) exist between the synonyms.

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

Third, the kinds of common groupings, in phrases or sentences, (collocations) are shown for each of the words. This is followed by a discussions of similarities and differences among the synonyms regarding the grammatical constructions for each. llustrations are also included.

Piotrowski (1990) includes a more detailed description of this dictionary and its relation to theory; he also evaluates several other attempts to implement relational models in practical dictionaries of Russian and English. For further information on the model and its use in lexicography, refer to his work as well as to Mel'cuk and Zholkovsky (1984).

# Practice 4.3

1. Much relational information is already present in most dictionaries and need only be made explicit. Promise and pledge may be listed as synonyms, hot and coid as antonyms. Hyponyms appear in definitions with words such as $\mathbf { \tilde { a } }$ kind of" $\mathbf { \check { a } }$ cat is a [kind of] mammal). A causal relation is shown in a definition such as "to send means to cause to go.' Evens (1988), who uses slightly different relation terms than Mel'cuk, suggests that these relations can be abbreviated very simply in word-relation-word trip lets such as

promise SYN pledge   
hot ANT1 cold   
lion TAX(onomy) mammal   
to send CAUSE to go   
cygnet CHILD swan   
petal PART flower   
Monday SEQUENCE Tuesday (Data source: Evens, 1988, p. 3)

Select three definitions from a dictionary and list the relations in triplets following Evens's example.

2. The verb make has so many meanings that it is difficult to see how it might be detined independent of the words that surround it. Piotrowski (1990) gives an MTM treatment to this verb by noting tirst its "independent" meanings: \*to make tables (bricks, wine, machines, dinner, breakfast)" and 'to make a list (a note, notes, a report, a law, one's will)." This is followed by meanings wholly dependent on the words with which it collocates. Some of these are lexical - "to make money (profit, a tivelihood, a living)," "to make friends (enemies, an ally of somebody)" -- whereas others are more grammar-bound -- "to make somebody do something," "to make oneself understand." Next, partial loss of lexical meaning is shown (e.g., \*Two and two make four," "wili you make one of our party?" 'to make a jump, move, start"). This is followed by phrasat verbs (e.g.. "make do with") and idioms ("make up your mind"). Using make as an example, discuss what advantages the MTM approach would have in a dictionary for language learners or language translators.

3. Meara (1990), in an article on how to help learners move passive vocabulary to active status, uses graphs to show the relations among items. He notes that associations are sometimes unidirectional. For example, cabbage white, green, but not white, green cabbage. Such graphs might be useful in showing why some words are harder for learners to retrieve than others. How might a relational dictionary reveal such information (as well as other information on relations) without becoming too cumbersome for learners to use?

4. The words "explanatory combinatorial' in the title of a dictionary implies that the dictionary uses relational theory. It is explanatory in that it explains all the relations between all the words in any given semantic field. It is combinatory because it also gives all the acceptable word combinations and information on syntactic patterns. Could any of your dictionaries qualify as an explanatory combinatorial dictionary? If not, what wou!d need to be changed to make it approach these two aspects of such dictionaries?

# Applying relational models

Although most of the work on relational models has been done in eastern Europe or in Montreal (where Mel'cuk is located), there are lexicographers and cognitive psychologists in the United States who have adopted many of Mel'cuk and Apresjan's methods in order to show the semantic relations between words. This group of relational semanticists is often identified as working with semantic networks, with natural language processing in computer science, or with relational lexicography. We will discuss their application of semantic relations in more detail in Chapter 6.

Relational semanticists are bridge builders; that is, they are open to using research done within other semantic models. For example, they often incorporate insights of prototype theory and semantic feature analysis in their work. They do this by using the notion of intension and

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

extension in model building. Extension is the things which a term names. The extension of the term tree would include individual trees such as elm, oak, pine, and so forth. The term oak would encompass California live oak and black oak among others. Intension is the set of attributes or features that characterize the term. The intension of tree would include root, trunk, branch, twig, leaf, and so forth. Still, individual researchers may emphasize the relations that are used for one type over the other. Computer scientists, for example, seem to work primarily with extension relations, and linguists often emphasize intension relations.

There are also linguists and cognitive psychologists who have used insights from relational models to interpret their research. For example, Markowitz (1988) asked adults to sort cards showing pictures of various birds, pieces of furniture, clothing, and so on, into categories -- a typical prototype semantics task. She then analyzed the comments people made as they carried out the sorting task. Markowitz first compared her results with those of Rosch, Labov, and others, showing that the perceptual shape/size dimension was important in determining whether or not an example fit into a stack. If a kitchen utensil became too large, it was put into an appliance stack; if tools became too large, they were put into a machine stack; if birds were very small (e.g., hummingbirds), they were grouped with insects; and small trees were separated into a bushes group.

Markowitz, however, found that people sorted the pictures into groups according to other criteria as well. Some people named the eagle as the most birdlike of the bird pictures because it was "so American." Gourmet cooks named stove as the best example of a kitcben utensil, while others placed it in appliance or furniture stacks. Some objects were related to the people associated with them. For example, a broom was not a good example of a kitchen utensil because janitors use them; chess was not a good example of sport because older people play it, and tape measures were not good tools because women use them for sewing. (Obviously these participants had not had much experience with female carpenters, electricians, or plumbers.!

Markowitz applied a relational model of the lexicon in classifying the types of dimensions in ber data set. The relation she found most important in decision making was that of function (e.g., \*a bulietproof vest isn't clothing because it's to stop bullets"). Size and shape were important, but so was the part-whole relation (e.g., "a snake isn't a good example of an animal because it has no legs"; "a turtle isn't a good animal because it has a sbell"). The locative relation also was important ("eyes are not good examples of body parts because they are part of your face"). The relational analysis allowed Markowitz to categorize and explain the comments of participants in this study.

Iris (1984) also pointed out that knowledge of local events and social or cultural factors should be considered when looking at the development of types of relations in child language. She asked Navajo children to talk (in Navajo) about a set of forty picture cards of different animals. They named the animals, described them, and sorted the cards into groups that "go together," giving a rationale for the sorting. Although previous studies had shown that adults used the hyponym relation in such tasks, the children did not. Rather, they ralked about the animals in terms of actions (e.g., "it eats hay, it bucks, it kicks, it runs, it sings"), locations (e.g., its home, habitat), and physical properties. In addition, they talked about possession (things the animal has), communality (something the animal does with others, as "the sheep go around together"), emotions (e.g., \*the bull gets mad"), and functions (e.g., "horses are used to rope a bull"). After examining the data from individual children in detail, Iris suggests that, instead of assuming that as children mature their definitions become more complex, we consider that as children mature they move toward greater consistency in giving definition and a better integration of information across items within a lexical domain.

Iris used the relational model to investigate lexical organization of monolingual children. Although no one has done so to our knowledge, applying relational models to the data would give new life to research on bilingual word associations. Word association research has a long history in psychology, and it has heen an area of interest in bilingualism where researchers wish to understand how the lexicon of two languages might be represented in the brain. Most of these studies use the storage metaphor. One expectation in this research is that if words in two languages for the same concept are stored together, then all the data about the concept would also be shared by both languages. We would expect the learner to give similar word associations for a given stimulus in each language. Kolers (1963) had university students who were native speakers of Thai, German, and Spanish carry out a word association task under four conditions: first language associations to first language stimuli; English associations to English stimuli; first language associations to English stimuli; and English associations to first language stimuli. Sample responses for the Spanish speakers included:

L1-L1 English-English   
mesa silla table dish   
muchacho hombre boy girl   
rey reina king queen   
casa madre house window L1-English English-L1   
mesa chair table silla   
muchacho trousers boy ninia   
rey queen king reina   
casa mother house blanco

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

The bilingual students in this study gave very similar word associations to those of native speakers as long as the stimulus word was a concrete noun and in particular if the object could be handled and manipulated as well. They gave fewer simiiar associations when the stimulus word was abstract or emotion-laden. Politzer (1978) also found that Americans studying French gave word associations similar to those of native speakers but also gave syntagmatic and clang responses to some words. If we think about word association responses in terms of relations {rather than in terms of whether or not the words from each language are stored together with the concept), we find that bilinguals do not simply give the translation in the opposite language. Rather, the relations are often those of nonantonymic contrast, hyponyms, or part-whole. Such findings have led to speculation as to whether translations are synonyms or identical (i.e., the same concept with different forms).

We mentioned earlier that the MacLeod (1976) study showed that greater savings of meanings occur in tests of recall in the hyponym relation than in the synonym relation. Turning to bilinguals, MacLeod investigated whether the same results would occur for direct translations of items. He asked French--English bilinguals to learn a list of 20 numberword combinations. Five weeks later they were asked to recal! the word in response to the number. All the missed items were then relearned under four conditions. The word paired with the number was either (1) the same word as before in the same language, (2) a different word in the same language, (3) the same word in the other language, or (4) a different word in the other language. The participants were then asked to count backward by threes from 100, and then were retested. The findings showed, not surprisingly, that savings occurred under condition 1: the same word in the same language. However, the same amount of savings was shown for condition 3: the same word in the other language. This led MacLeod to view the two words for the same concept as identical rather than as synonymous.

There are a wealth of studies on bilingual word association, studies which have been carried out to address a wide array of research questions. Much of this literature might now be reviewed with the question of how it connects to work on relational models of semantics.

# Practice 4.4

1. In Markowitz's study, some people put all pictures of ugly insects in one group and all pretty ones in another. Some people separated cultivated flowers (such as roses) from wildflowers. What dimension(s) would cover this card sort? Do you think your dimension(s) are important in determining the most prototypic instance of most objects?

2. Markowitz's study is especially interesting because it uses both numerical data and qualitative data. As participants sorted cards into groups, they were asked to explain the stacks they made, as well as their ratings of how good an example each item in the stack was. Because the items. the procedure, and the analysis are all very clear, this might be a good candidate for a replication study using participants from another language group. By doing the replication and publishing the results, you may also contribute to work on relational models of the lexicon.   
3. Parker (1985) reported on a pilot observation of two teachers giving definitions during reading lessons to thirdgrade classes that consisted of many Chinese and Hispanic students. The following extended definition sequence links many words to the word spring. List the relations you discover to the word spring in the data. How useful do you think relational models would be in analysis Of classroom data?   
T: What's a spring, Tessa. I explained it to you. Just a few minutes ago.   
Tessa: It's a um um puddle of water. That's underneath the ground. That um . . . it is . . . that is fresh.   
T: It's fresh water that you can drink. It's a small . amount of water. It's not like a big lake or something. Okay. And you can for --   
Tessa: The dirt's in the water. Then it's yukky.   
T: Well, the dirt is heavier than the water so it's gonna settle to the bottom ot the water, and if you scoop off scoop off the top, you're gonna get clean water. Because dirt is heavy. So it's not gonna stay on the top.   
Tessa: Well how big is it?

T: Right. And that's what they did in the desert. When the springs dried up, and they couldn't get any more water, they had to move on. Okay? That's why Abu never had a home. Tessa: Well why did Abu start digging in that other place.   
T: Well that's further along. We'll find out.

(Parker, 1985)

4. In both the Markowitz and Iris studies discussed in this section, the authors emphasize that social and cultural knowledge must be considered when we carry out research on both acquisition and use of relations. For example, Iris points out that a Navajo man used many relations in talking about certain animals, but when talking about cow, bull, horse, and donkey, the items were all linked together using the rodeo activities of roping. kicking, and bucking. The Navajo word for man, hastiin, was linked to these animals by the activities of riding, roping, and clowning that are typically carried out at the rodeo. Given this cultural context, the responses and types of relations were much more consistent for these animals. Provide an example of a context that would shape the types of responses and relations for yourself or for your language students.   
5. If we analyze a semantic tield, we organize the items within the domain in some logical way. For example, the field of animals might be organized by biological species. However, it might also be classitied in terms of pets, tivestock, and other animals. Or it might be classified according to whether the animal was bovine (eats grass), canine. or feline. Consider how these terms would be handled in relational models of semantics. What are the advantages or disadvantages of each method for data analysis? What advantages or disadvantages do you see for application to teaching?

There are many different relational models, all of which identify lexica! relations (but disagree on the number of relations). The models are proposed primarily by lexicographers working with cognitive scientists in an attempt to build computerized natural language processing systems.

Lexicographers have long criticized work in semantics as being illustrative; that is, it describcs only a few examples (such as bachelor). They believe that semantic theories must be encyclopedic (i.e., coverage similar to that of a dictionary and a thesaurus). They believe that relational models are a step in the right direction. Relational modeis of the lexicon are, indeed, important if computer models of scripts are ever to move beyond limited examples to more encyclopedic coverage. We will return to this topic in Chapter 7.

# Research and application

. Singleton and Little (l99l) used a C-test to collect data from learners of French and German. (A C-test is similar to a cloze test, where students supply words that have been deleted from a text.) In Singleton and Little's C-test, students restored words from the text where only part of the word was deleted. The French passage began: Aujourd'hui Ia communication entre la jeunesse et le monde des adultes est devenue presque impossible. Les adu_ s'efforcent d. ... se mon_ tolerants, ma. Ies po. - sont bri ... Singleton and Little then analyzed the responses of the students against the background of word association studies (especially Meara and Soderman's work on paradigmatic and clang responses). They found that when students made errors, the errors were predominantly semantically related to the missing word. Some interesting creations occurred. For example, in a slot that should have been filled in with auteur (author), a learner used autrice assuming probably that there should be a feminine form for author and linking the form auteur to like forms (acteur--actrice; mediateur-mediatrice). After reading the article, construct a C-test for another language group. Admimister the test to five people who are learning the language. Instead of linking your analysis to that of syntagmatic vs. paradigmatic responses, analyze the responses using a relational analysis.

2. Soderman (l993) reports on the most comprehensive word association tests of foreigu language learners based on responses written by Finnish students at different levels of Enghish proficiency (seventh grade, high school, university, and highly proficient language majors) to the Kent-Rosanoff word association list. Her data challenge the assumption that a shift in types of responses is just a matter of age and language proficiency. To study this further, she compared the responses of very proficient learners of English and native speakers on very frequent and relatively infrequent words. Both groups made more syntagmatic responses to infrequent items. Soderman suggests this may be because it is often difficult to think of a synonym or antonym for less frequent words. If you are interested in research on the bilingual lexicon, this study is essential. As you go through the experiments, consider how the study might be recast in light of relational models of the lexicon.

3. Iris et al. (1988) comment on the acquisition of part-whole relations by children. The early acquisition of spatial expressions reflect the claim that all relations are originally derived from physical knowledge of the world. These part-whole relations are then extended to nonphysical examples. Iris et al. claim the child gradually expands but does not necessarily replace the spatial with class, superordinate, and taxonomic structures. The earlier relations are retained to be used when needed. Part-whole is then not one relation but a whole family of overlapping relations. Iris et al. propose four general part-whole schemata: functional, segmented, collections and members, and sets and subsets. Other lexicographers have claimed that there are more than four types. Chaffin and Herrmann (1988) claim there are at least six. Read each of these articles and decide how developmental data (or data frorn second language learners) might support each claim.

4. In Practice l.2.4, we noted the use of nicht rather than an antonym in the data of a German learner. Duff has analyzed the data of an adult learner of Chinese who aIso used negation but in a shightly different manner. In this case, the learner did not know the term near here or nearby and said: "Ta zhu zai nar. Bu yuan bu yuan." (She lives there. Not far not far.) The native speaker then asked if the person lives at school, to which the learner replied, "Bu shi xue xiao. Ta- ta de fang jian bu yuan." (It's not school. Her- her room is not far.) Using these examples, show how one might use relational modeIs in the analysis of the circumlocutions or other strategies that learners use when they do not know or cannot recall a lexical item.

5. Sterrberg and Powell (l983) asked high school students to read passages that contained unknown words and then to write sentences using the words. Eight types of context cues that occurred in the passages seemed to influence the students' abihty to write definitions. These included time, space, description of physical properties, functions, worth or affect, cause, class membership, and equivalence. Determine the relation for each of these eight types of cues and then reinterpret the study in terms of relational models. You might wish to replicate the study with your international students, relating your findings to this study and to relational models of semantics.

6. Ilson and Mel'cuk (l989) discuss the network of relations among the various senses of the concept BAKE. They note that BAKE has three senses: (1) dry heat in cooking, (2) dry heat making something hard, and (3) dry heat as it affects people. Example sen

tences include "Potatoes bake well." "John baked the potatoes." "The rolls baked quickly." "John baked the pot in the kiln." "This oven bakes excellent bread." "The mud on the shore baked hard." "Boston was baking in a heat wave." Semantic relations are given to illustrate each of the senses for BAKE and illustrations are given of other expressions (baked Alaska, baked beans, sunbaked) that also need to be treated if the coverage is to be encyclopedic (for their explanatory combinatorial dictionary). Compare and contrast this analysis with the discussion of cooking terms in semantic field analysis in Chapter 2.

7. Riegel (l970) used a relational approach to study changes in definitions of children as they mature and of those of the elderly. In general, he found an increased use of multiple relations, which he believes mark cognitive reorganization throughout life. If you are interested in ontological and gerontological issues, read this volume. Do you agree with Riegel's categorization of relations into four groups? How might you apply this study to your own research on vocabulary acquisition and attrition?

. Casagrande and Hale (l967), as part of a study in dialect variation, collected folk definitions from one speaker of Papago (an American Indian language) for 800 terms. The definitions were then reduced so that a definition of the Papago word for wolf was "they are like coyotes, but big.'" The definition includes two relations - comparison (like coyotes) and attribute (big). The types of relations used were then listed by frequency (along with English glosses of the definitions). Finally, the types of relations used by this individual were compared with those that appear in traditional English word association lists. Werner, Manning, and Begishe (1983) and Iris (1984) follow a similar method looking for relations in the definitions given by Navajo speakers. How might you use this methodology to carry out a similar study? If you are interested in the differences in contrasts between the types of relations used to organize information in different languages, you could use tle methodology. first collecting folk definitions in one language and then in the otlier. if you decide to develop this topic, be aware that relational semanticists have cautioned that more precision is needed in identifying relations within folk definitions (and that working from the English glosses can lead one into error). As you develop your research plan, decide which set of relations (Mel'tuk's or others) you will use and be sure that you can identify each in a consistent manner.

# 5 Semantics cf figurative language

# Pervasiveness of figurative language

As shown in the previous chapters, linguists have searched for ways of describing the semantic structure of words and how they relate or refer to concepts or to semantic fields. These descriptions were evaluated in terms of how well a taxonomy distinguished related terms in a semantic field. Their research demonstrates quite clearly that referential semantics is an important field of inquiry. However, only since the late 1970s and ear!y 1980s have we begun again to realize how important and pervasive figurative language is. Metaphorical processes are as fundamental as literal reference in semantics.

In Chapter 4, we noted that relational models treat figurative language as just one of more than fifty semantic relations. Taxonomies, as we have already seen, can be useful but, in this case, they hide the pervasive nature of metaphor as a cognitive and social semantic process.

We will return to taxonomic descriptions, but first, to show what we mean by the pervasive nature of metaphor, consider some ordinary, everyday language examples from Lakoff and Johnson's (1980) Metaphors We Live $B y .$ In this seminal work, Lakoff and Johnson note that we often talk about abstract concepts using the terms for more concrete concepts. We use terms from a concrete source field to talk about an abstract target field. For example, IDEA is an abstract concept. It is difficult to give a precise definition of the word idea. So, we turn to other source fields. We may talk about ideas as though they were plants, food, or people:

Source -- Target   
Plants - Ideas Ideas are planted even in a barren mind ideas grow from seeds ideas bud, flower, or die on the vine   
Food -- Ideas cook up an idea idea smells fishy stew over an idea swallow an idea a half-baked idea

People -- Ideas idea is someone's brainchild idea still in its infancy idea needs to mature; what an adolescent idea! the idea died but was resurrected

As you have noticed, we do not select only one source and use it metaphorically in talking about the rarget. We often use multiple layers of metaphor. Several sources may be used for one target concept:

Source -- Target   
Building -- Argunent lay a foundation build the argument brick by brick provide a scaffolding for our side   
War - Argument shoot holes in my argument take aim ar a premise attack an argument or point of view

A second basic point established by Lakoff and Johnson is that metaphor is common and pervasive not just in English but in all languages and across ail dialects and that it appears in literary as well as everyday language. One of the basic metaphors in Western societies is PEOPLE are MACHINES. Lakoff and Turner (1989) call our attention to its use in poetry:

At the violet hour, when the eyes and back   
Turn upward from the desk, when the human engine waits Like a taxi throbbing waiting.

# (T. S. Eliot, "The Waste Land")

The same metaphor occurs in everyday language. In a note, for example, a friend wrote, \*I'm running out of steam. I think my gears are stuck." Lakoff gives an example in which the metaphor works both ways: "The computer is punishing me by wiping out my buffer." Here the machine is a person who punishes and the person is a machine containing a buffer.

The issue of the system behind such metaphors will be discussed in detail later, but before we do that, we want to review the more classical method of identifying and classifying types of figurative language.

# Practice 5.1

1. Look at each of the three source-to-target metaphors for IDEA. Add as many examples to the list as you can. Then search for similar terms in a language you are learning or teaching. How universal are these particular metaphors {IDEAS are PLANTS, lDEAS are FOOD, IDEAS are PEOPLE)?

2. Are the metaphors reversible? Can we talk about plants as ideas, food as ideas, and people as ideas? In the PEOPLE are MACHINES metaphor, we noted that it is possible to reverse the metaphor to MACHINES are PEOPLE (i.e.. machines can be personified). Do you believe the sourceto-target relation is more often unidirectional? Give examples to support your opinion.

3. Here are some examples of metaphor from political campaign rhetoric. Everyday metaphor: "A much better shot at carrying the state." Original metaphor: "The White House isn't a Waffle House." Is it possible to determine the source and target fields for each? In these examples, is metaphor used to talk about abstract concepts? if not, why is metaphor employed?

# Categorizing figurative language

Traditionally, figurative language has been described in terms of categories: simile, metaphor, allusion, personification, and so forth. We will look at each of these categories briefly.

If one turns to traditional treatments of figurative language, two major categories stand out: simile and metaphor. When we use a simile we call attention to the fact that we are asking the listener or reader to consider $x$ as similar to Y. We do this with the phrase $^ { \mathfrak { s } } X$ is like a Y." We make the comparison explicit by asking that there be a transfer of characteristics of $Y$ to X. We find many examples of simile in literature, poetry, and everyday talk. In his poem "A Dream Deferred," Langston Hughes wrote

Whar happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up like a raisin in the sun?

and we visualize a strong, vital dream dying and drying up into a shriveled, ugly raisin. Or consider Robert Burns's poem, $^ { \circ } \mathrm { O }$ , my luve is like a red, red rose," and we transfer the characteristics of a red, red rose to a woman. When we read Shapespeare's satiric sonnet 130, "My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun," we again transfer characteristics from a source field to a target field.

We find similes in everyday talk, too.

This heat! It's like the Fourth of July! The noise is like a waterfall. How could it be just a flood?

In contrast to simile, metaphor does not say that something is like a source field; it uses the source field to define the target. Emily Dickinson writes \*Hope is a thing with feathers that perches in the soul." Here the distinction between is like and is appears marginal. However, when Car! Sandburg writes, "The fog comes on little cat feet. It sits looking over harbor and city on silent haunches and then moves on," the metaphor is clear. Fog is a cat; it is not just like a cat.

In poetry, we are aware that similes and metaphors are being used. Yet, we may be unaware of the pervasive nature of simile and metaphor in everyday talk.

Two additional terms, synecdoche and metonymy, describe different categories (though, perhaps, not different processes) of figurative language. Synecdoche covers those cases where we use a part for a whole or the whole to talk about the part. Metonymy is the category where something closely connected (but not a part) is used to refer to the whole. Thus, in synecdoche, "ten sails" may be used to refer to ten ships in describing a sailboat race ("Ten sails can be seen rounding the buoy"), or "gray beards" might be used to refer to old men ("We need some gray beards to help us out"). Fxamples of metonymy include "the crown" to refer to a queen, "the bench" for a judge, or "the balcony" for the people in the balcony of a theater. Another delightful example reported is "The ham sandwich is a lousy tipper." The ham sandwich is not part of the person who ordered it but is related to him, a clear case of metonymy. Lakoff and Turner (1989) use a slightly different categorization: in metaphor, a "whole schematic structure is mapped onto another whole schematic structure." Metonymy, for Lakoff and Turner, has only one conceptual domain and two things belong to it. So part-whole relations are metonymy. Examples from Lakoff and Turner of part for whole include "We need some new blood in the organization" and "Mrs. Grundy frowns on blue jeans." They also consider face for person ("We need some new faces around here') and object for user ("The buses arc on strike") as examples of metonymy. In Lakoff and Turner, no distinction is drawn between synecdoche and metonymy.

Personification is another category of figurative language. We talk about objects as though they were people, asking the listener to assign the qualities of humanness to objects. For example, we talk about the health of our relationships as though relationships could take on the characteristics of people ("a healthy/sick/tired affair"). Newspapers, books, and other texts are commonly personified; they can talk or perform other actions just like people ("the paper said," "books tell us," "the experiment shows us"). Personification is so common that we are scarcely aware of how powerful a process it is.

High schooi literature classes learn the three As, a mnemonic device to remember the terms antithesis, allusion, and apostrophe. In each of these,

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

we illustrate a concept by referring to something or someone else. Apostrophe allows us to address inanimate things or historical personages as though they were alive. Edna St. Vincent Millay provides us with an example when she begins a poem, "Oh world, I cannot hold thee close enough." Allusion allows us to refer to persons, places, or events (real or imagined) to illustrate or add to a statement. A friend on a whalewatching trip alluded to the poet Robert Frost, saying "and whales to see before we sleep," and a retired friend alluded to Tennyson's "to rust unburnished, not to shine in use," saying old folks need to "shine in use, not to rust unburnished on the shelf." By doing this, we ask our listeners or readers to bring knowledge from the source and apply it to our target point. Sometimes the allusions are a bit obscure. For example, the news commentator Daniel Shorr once described the inaction of our government in meetings with NATO and the UN as reports from the Dithering Heights. The allusion to Wuthering Heights seems obscure and not particularly apt though it has a nice ring. Antithesis allows us to connect drastically opposing ideas. The connection is usually in opposing phrases like "You're coming, I'm going." The classic example is "Give me liberty Or give me death!"

If you consult a source for a list of literary devices you may find other methods mentioned which also connect a source field to a target field. Some other strategies include irony (e.g., "He's a real winner" said of a klutz) and oxymoron (e.g., a "fun run" is an oxymoron for anyone who hates running). Also listed are understatement (e.g., "a trifle cold" said of a 5-below-zero-degree cold front) and hyperbole ("a sea of despair"). Although antithesis connects drastically opposing ideas, paradox opposes conflicting sources. For example, the snake is a symbol almost universally associated with the sky and celestial phenomena. In North American mythology it is the symbol for rainhows, lightning, and rain; water is the source of life. But, paradoxically, it is also the symbol of the underworld, darkness, and death.

The identification and listing of categories of figurative language may be useful, for when we read research about figurative language, we need to know which types of metaphor are included under the umbrella term. Nevertheless, with metaphoric language, whatever the type, we utilize the same underlying process: the speaker or reader applies some aspect or similarity from a source in order to talk or write about a target.

# Practice 5.2

1. Nash (1985) in his book on linguistics and humor, gives one formula for jokes: $\pmb { x }$ is like Y. "Living in Pearblossom is Jike watching a plank warp." Is this a simile or a metaphor?

How many jokes can you think of that tit this formula? Are any of them funny if you change the torm to a metaphor?

2. Ragevsky (1979) does not separate metonymy and synedoche. Instead, metonymy is divided into six types. Add an example to each of Ragevsky's.

a. sign for signified thing: grey beard   
b. instrument for agent: best pens of the day   
c. container for thing contained: drank a cup   
d. name of organs: play by ear, ready tongue   
e. whole or genus for part or species: the poor creature that is man.

We would expect hyperbole to run rampant (yes, that is a metaphor) in advertising. However, Ragevsky gives us examples ("a thousand and one cares," "haven't seen you for ages," "flood of tears," "millions of reasons," "world of effort," and even "skyscraper") that occur in everyday talk. Collect examples of hyperbole. In what circumstances are they used? Do you use them?

3. Advertising is full of oxymorons such as "genuine imitation leather" and "real manufactured gemstones." "Free gifts' offered in promotions are seldom free. Government is also guilty of confusing us with terms like "value added tax." No value is added by the tax; in fact, the value of the item once the tax is paid is less, so the tax should be called a value subtracted tax. Collect your own examples of oxymorons. In one sense, such oxymorons are humorous, but they could also be harmful. Are your examples harmless or harmful?

4. A favorite example of paradox is the biblica! passage from Ecclesiastes 3:7-8.

a time to rend, and a time to sew . . a time to love, and a time to hate a time of war, and a time of peace.

In this case, is it clear which is source and which is target? Or is the entire passage a source which is to be applied to an overall target?

5. In the Navajo belief system, many of the powers, with the possible exception of Changing Woman, are both good and bad. Is the paradox relation common in the beliet systems of many cultures? Give examples if you can. If paradox is important in belief systems, what might this say about the role of figurative language in human thought?

6. There are many types of correspondence used in analogies. Supply the missing member in the second set.

branch: tree page: (component: object)   
tree: forest book: (member: collection)

aluminum: airplane wood: (stuff: object)   
paying: shopping chewing: (feature: activity)   
Los Angeles: Cairo: (place: area) California   
adolescence: grow- memorization: (phase: ing up process)

We can use such analogies, asking listeners or readers to apply the characteristics of a source to a target. So we might refer to a search for a book in the library as looking through a forest in hope of finding one special leaf. In forming such analogies, we may employ synecdoche, metonymy, or even personification. Give an example of your own for each of the analogies listed. Then use each in a tigurative way by applying it to a target.

7. What would you think if, in an article on the acquisition of metaphor by second.language learners, all the examples of metaphor happened to be personitication? If you were designing a special research "caboose" for a proficiency exam, what range of types of metaphor would you want to include in order to feel confident that the results could speak to the issue of learners' comprehension of all types of figurative language?

# Metaphor as a universal process

In the remainder of this chapter, we use the term metaphor to refer to the process of applying or using a source to talk about a target. The identification is not through ordinary, literal reference but rather via this transfer of meaning from one area to another.

The cognitive psychologist H. Clark (1973) noted that we talk about many things in a less than literal way. For example, we talk about understanding as though it were a visual phenomenon ("oh, I see, I see!"). We use directional prepositions up and down to talk about how we feel ("I'm feeling up." "That lifts my spirits." "He's really down."). In his research, Clark found that many of our ordinary ways of talking about our experience relate to our human perceptual system and our experiences with the real world. This is quite clear in the many visual metaphors in the English language.

To explain the up-down metaphors, Ciark related their use to the three physical reference planes and three associated directions. The normal encounter in conversations is face to face. Our eyes, ears, and feet all point to the front. The first of the three physical reference planes, when we are standing, is ground level. Everything that is aboveground and seen is up and positive. Things unseen, down, belowground are negative. This use of up and down as positive and negative in value is then applied to a variety of targets. We talk about our conscious and unconscious states as up and down (e.g., "wake up" vs. "fall asleep"). When we talk about control, we use up and down for being subject to control (e.g., we are "held down" or we "rise to the occasion"). Status, too, is related to whether one is up or down ("high on the ladder" vs. "fall from office," "low man on the totem pole?). Rational and emotional terms are contrasted in terms of up for rational ("keep the discussion on a high plane") and down for emotions ("fall in love") and in politics ("They were shouting at each other. It was so dirty. A low-level debate in every respect!") The second physical reference plane is ro the right and left as we look "out" in standing position. Both directions are positive but are viewed as distracting from what is straight ahead. So we talk about "side issues," "side talk," and about "having to take sides" - all are viewed as distractions to our normal straight ahead orientation.

The third physical reference plane is the front-back vertical plane. Things in front are positive (\*look ahead") while those behind are usually less positive ("don't look back"). This third physica! reference plane is the basis of many of the metaphors we have for life because we use this spatial reference plane to talk about time. We view time as though we are moving ahead along a highway. We talk about future time as "coming events" ("I'm looking forward to your party'). We say that time comes and goes by us ("This week really rushed by. Before I knew it, the week flew by"). We talk of "trouble ahead." We worry about being early or late, "ahead of time" and "behind schedule," as though time and space relate to our physical reference planes.

Examples such as these led Clark to believe that much of everyday metaphor in language has a perceptual basis, and since humans all have the same perceptual mechanisms, he hypothesized that these same metaphors would occur across languages. They are universal.

Lakoff (1987) and colleagues (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Lakoff & Turner, 1989) have provided a more comprehensive argument that metaphor is perceptually based. They have demonstrated that metaphor is both a perceptually based system and a socially based system. Before looking at metaphor as a socially based system, we will look at three important questions that I.akoff and colleagues have addressed regarding metaphor as a perceptually based system. One question has to do with system within sets of metaphors. Can such a system be discovered? A second question is whether some metaphors are more basic (and acquired earlier) than others? A third question has to do with the distinction between everyday metaphor and literary metaphor. The first two questions may be more cognitive in nature than the third, but the research and the claims regarding each question concern the universality of the process.

# System in perceptual metaphor

To illustrate the notion of system in perceptual metaphor, we will begin with an example of metaphor of emotions. Emotions are abstract feelings and so it is only natural that we would use other source fields to talk about the rarget field of emotion. However, in emotional states, we do have perceptions of tension, of heat or chill, or perhaps agitation. These perceptions are clear in the metaphors we use for love and anger. Kovecses (1986) gives us many examples for the emotion of anger. We feel body heat, pressure, agitation; notice the redness of skin that results; and perhaps our anger even interferes with normal perception (see examples below). Notice that the feeling of heat leads us to a FIRE source as a metaphor for anger. In our agitation, we may take on our opponent and that agitation becomes a source metaphor for anger. The examples of anger interfering with our normal perceptual processes (adapted from Lakoff, 1987, pp. 380-397) gives us the metaphor of anger as insanity:

ANGER is FIRE inflammatory remarks add fuel to the fire

Body heat hot under the collar all hot and bothered   
Pressure hurst a blood vesse! have a hemorrhage   
Redness scarlet with rage flushed witb anger red with anger   
Agitation shaking with anger hopping mad quivering with rage all worked up   
Interference with perception blind with rage seeing red couldn't see straight   
ANGER is an OPPONENT struggle, battle, fight, wrestle with, overcome surrender to, come to grips with   
ANGER is INSANITY drives me out of my mind drives me nuts/bananas go crazy, berserk/bonkers

Kovecses then looked for system within metaphors of emotion. A basic notion is that we contain our emotions inside our bodies. This builds on the BODY is a CONTAINER metaphor. Lakoff and Johnson give us many English examples that fit this notion ("she is filled with love"; \*she was filled with anger"). Kovecses suggests that the intensity of the emotion has to do with how filled the container becomes. We talk about the depth of our love as a measure of its intensity. When the container becomes filled, the emotion overflows. We $\pmb { \mathscr { p } }$ our out our feelings as our emotions overflow.

Turning to anger, Kovecses and Lakoff see stages in the degree or amount of anger. According to Lakoff and his colleagues, we can capture this information on emotions in a systematic way if we begin with metaphor of the physical body as a container.

BODY IS A CONTAINER filted with anger, love, despair, loneliness contain my joy brimming with happiness   
Emotion is the heat of a fluid in a container Why are you so cold? an old flame You make my blood boil Simmer down! keep coo! reach the boiling point   
Emotion increases, the fluid rises anger welled up building up inside in a towering rage felt her gorge rise   
It produces steam, pressure, explosion all steamed up, fuming She blew up blew a gasket (piston), erupted (volcano), blew a fuse (electricity), on a short fuse, set me off (explosive, bomb)   
Part of container goes up in the air blew my stack, flipped her lid, hit the ceiling, went through the roof   
The fluid comes out poured out her love, oozed sweetness, smoke poured out his ears, she had kittens, had a cow (Adapted from Lakoff, 1987, pp. 380-397)

These metaphors all relate to the human perceptual systems, to the way we perceive the world around us and the feelings within us. Some of the metaphors are more prototypic than others. For example, we can talk about "cold anger," but the use of heat and fire for anger would be more

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

prototypic than cold. "Cold anger" seems to be anger that is very tightly controlled, unable to surface but stored in an intense form for later retaliatory use.

All humans have the same perceptual system, so it follows that many of these metaphors should be universal in nature. Shyu (1989) and Kelly (1989) investigated the issue of universality by comparing the system of metaphors of love and anger in Chinese and Turkish with those of English. The word for anger in Chinese is ch'i, which also means any kind of gas, odor, or air, as in the atmosphere. It also means \*the breath of life," a form of energy. Although ch'i is invisible, Chinese medicine claims that health is mainly determined by whether the ch'i can circulate well in the body. Ch'i combines with adjectives to describe emotions such as "joyfu! air" (hsi ch'i), "angry air" (nu ch'i or yuan ch't), and "haughty air" (ao ch't), meaning joy, anger, and pride, respectively. Normally, the ch'i inside the body stays calm and unnoticed. However, when someone is irritated, the air appears ("his chest is full of angry air"), the pressure grows within the container (\*he is bearing pent-up air"), and the angry person may be warned to calm or cool the air. But if the air increases, it results in aggressive facial behaviors ("his air caused his face to become green, purple"; \*his air caused his green blood vessels to pop out, he suddenly changed color") and then escapes ("the angry air caused the smoke to pour out of his seven holes [mouth, nose, eyes, and ears]"; "his air caused his eyebrows to become straight and his eyes to become white'). As you can see, there are strong similarities to the system of metaphors of emotion that begins with the body as a container. In English, tbe building of anger is the change from a liquid, to heat, to steam. In Chinese, it is air which becomes heated and rises to be released as steam. Despite differences in details, the overall system appears to be the same.

Turkish metaphors are also similar to those of English although, as Kelly (1989) demonstrates, anger is often referred to as nerve: sinirden titrryordu (he trembled from nerves) and siniri oynadi (his nerves are dislocated, meaning really mad). Anger produces heat: kizma (don't get hot) and produces a color change: sinirden mosmor oldu (from nerves he became purple), renk vermemek (not to give color, meaning to hide one's feelings). Anger is also fire: ates sacmak (to scatter fire, which is to lose one's temper), burnundan ates fiskiriyordu (fire spouted out from his nose, showing extreme anger). Anger is seen as affecting the senses: Sinirden gozu hic birsey gormuyordu (from nerves, his eyes don't see anything, meaning he was blind with anger); and anger is insanity: Delirtmek (to send someone crazy). The body-is-a-container metaphor is also seen in Kelly's data. Yuregi sinirle dolu (his heart was filled with nerves) identifies the heart as one of the first parts of the container. Girtlagina kadar sinirle doluydu (he was filled up to his throat with nerves) shows anger building up to the moment before it explodes, bardagi tasiran son damla (the last drop that made the cup overflow) is the straw that broke the camel's back, and sinirlerim bosaldi (my nerves are emptied) shows the release once the container overflows.

Since the social worlds in which we live differ, we would expect to find some differences in the metaphors across languages. For example, most of the love poems in Arabic use metaphors that link the desert and thirst with longing for love. Our folk models or commonsense models of our social world might lead to quite different types or different uses of metaphor. The issue of universality and language or culture-specific metaphors needs much more detailed research.

The metaphors we have listed here for emotions are so common that some scholars have suggested that they are dead metaphors. However, it is clear that we draw upon these metaphors in order to express our feelings in new situations. In 1992, Los Angeles was the center of civil unrest. In a press conference from a White House Rose Garden meeting, concerned leaders said:

The temperature across the country, it's hot. It's at the boiling point.   
Boiling. It's boiling over in L.A.   
After things cool off, what will [President] Bush do? We're feeling the heat in L.A.   
It was just bottled up anger and it exploded in violence.   
They were venting the anger they felt. They're still simmering over the verdict.   
Rodney King lit the match and now we're burning.

And in Los Angeles, community leaders went on TV to speak to those who were rioting:

Hey, cool out. Back off. Move down.   
Chill out, folks. We're all outraged.   
They short fused. It's a flare up, unleashed fury but you gotta cool down.

So, the issue of whether or not such metaphors are dead is of little impor. tance. Metaphor permeates all of language and reflects the way we perceive our worlds, and, thus, helps others understand us.

1. In terms ot reterence planes, right and tett are both said to be positive yet there are many expressions in English that suggest that right is positive and left is less so. Right, meaning correct, is positive. \*My right-hand man' is a person who gives unquestioning support (originally it referred to male secretaries who sat to the right of the boss, and little attention is paid to the person who sits in that location), while a "left-handed compliment" is qualified support. List as many other examples of right and left expressions as

you can. Are they equally positive or negative? Do the same expressions appear in another language you may be Studying or teaching?

2. In a language you know, list examples for anger which parallel or differ from those offered by Kovecses and Lakoff. Do your examples support the claim of a universal conceptual basis for metaphors of emotion?

3. In Arabic, the emotion of love is commonly linked to water. Enani (1993) offers us translations from Arabic of Jines such as "i kissed her mouth, holding her locks on both sides of her head, and drank deeply as a thirsty man drinks from the cool water of a pond," or the less elegant (in English) lines that describe unattainable love "like camels in the desert, nearly dying of thirst even while carrying water on their backs." Poets write of longing and desire as stages in the "need for water.' Are such terms used widely in most desert cultures? How widespread is the love-as-thirst metaphor in English? Give examples to justify your answer.

4. Examples of metaphors for the emotion of love include heart, often used (metonymy) to reter to the emotion of love. Thus, love becomes an object which can be given to another (I gave him my heart"; "he held my heart in his hands"). It is a solid object but it can be broken (\*she broke his heart"). The object is a commodity ("I paid a lot for so little love," '1 treasured this love'). Love is also seen as a plant that grows (\*Our love flowered. Our love grew. 1 don't know why it died." Shu-ing Shyu (1989) reports a Chinese expression, \*this red apricot blossoms outside the wall," as a metaphor for a married woman who is having an affair - the flower is outside the house). The lover may be talked about as food (honey, sugar, hunger for your touch). Love is insanity ("I'm crazy about her," "he's driving me wild') and causes us to behave as animals (wolf, tiger). Lovers are birds (turtledoves, my little chickdee, love nest). For some, love is a game ("can't get to tirst base") or even war (conquest, shot down, war paint, dressed to kill). How similar are the metaphors of love in the language you used for item 2?

5. U.S. President Clinton has talked about \*growing the economy." He has also said, \*we've been in the basement so long, we don't know what it looks like up in the sunshine." Collect and analyze examples of his use (or that of some other leader ot your choice) of figurative language related to the economy.

6. When Clinton fired the head of the FB! for suspected misuse of perks, a commentator said that the FBt head was "not just under a cloud but out in the rain for six months." List as many metaphors of suspicion and shame as you can. Is it possible to group them as Lakoff and Kovecses have the metaphors of emotion?

# Acquisition of metaphor

A number of conflicting claims have been made about the acquisition and use of metaphors, arising from two points of view about the nature of metaphor. The first point of view is that metaphors are higher-order uses of language: they are creative and occur mainly in literature. In this view, the types of metaphor discussed in the previous section are of lirtle interest because they are dead metaphors and so are akin to cliches. The second, opposing point of view is that metaphor is a basic process in language and is ubiquitous. This second point of view states thar metaphor, even newly created literary metaphor, cannot be entirely new; it must be based in our perceptual and social systems. If this were not so, we would not understand new and creative uses of metaphor in literature.

This conflict about the nature of metaphor is also reflected in claims about the acquisition of metaphor. If one believes that metaphor is a higher-order skill used primarily in literature, the claim that children do not acquire metaphor until well into their teens seems reasonable. On the other hand, if one believes metaphor is a basic process in language, claims that children produce metaphor at an early age are quite tenable. In addition, if one believes that metaphor relates to basic perception, then certain types of metaphor should be acquired earlier than others. There is research in the literature that takes each position.

MacKay (1987) hypothesized that spatia! and personification metaphors should be the most basic since they relate most directly to perception. He surveyed the metaphors in 59 children's poems. The poems contained 864 "live\* (newly created) metaphors, 43 percent of which were personifications. He then went on to look at an additional 177 nursery rhymes and found 111 live metaphors, 77 percent of which were personifications. Poets writing for young children must believe, therefore, that young children are able to understand personification.

Billow (1981) and Leondar (1975) studied the language of preschool children and found that they spontaneously produced metaphors (e.g., describing themselves as "barefoot all over," using "daddy hopper" for a large grasshopper, or saying that mint candy produces a "draft in the mouth" or that a chimney is "a house hat").

If we look at Chukovsky's (1968) collection of children's language in verbal play (translated from the Russian), we find some examples that young children take things quite literally. For example, a child became quite upset on hearing an adult ask for the lady fingers. He protested that they are not made out of fingers but of dough. Chukovsky suggests, in spite of the many examples in the book, that children only create novel metaphors by accident. Yet examples of such accidents are numerous. For example, one child asked, "What's a knife? The fork's husband?" After swallowing each bite, another child stopped and listened. Then he smiled and said, "It just ran down the little ladder to my stomach." Another child marveled at the process of digestion: "Isn't it wonderful! I drink coffee, tea, cocoa, hut out of me pours only tea!"

Gardner et al. (1978) say that children can produce such metaphors but that they do not appreciate the metaphors of others nor can they offer a rationale for their own metaphors. Gardner et al. suggest there is a "U-shaped curve" for production of metaphors. Young children go through a "wild" stage where they do produce metaphors without true metaphoric capacity, followed by a period when they do not, only to rediscover metaphor at around 10 to 12 years of age. This position suggests that a child first learns literal meanings of words and only later begins to comprehend and use metaphor.

Piagetian theory suggests that children in the \*preoperational stage" can recognize metaphors if they apply to physical objects, but only later at the "concrete operational" stage will they agree that metaphoric meanings can extend to people. According to this school of thought, the production of metaphor requires the child to think of an object as though it were another, to perceive similarities, and to wilfully override the boundaries. Marti (1987) claims that early metaphors are a result of the child's incapacity to differentiate identity, resemblance, and difference relationships.

In a series of experiments, Palmero and associates found that children aged from 3 to 10 years, given a context and task that is appropriate to their age, do comprehend metaphorical relations. For example, preschool children can act out metaphoric relations (e.g., tears as rain). In a study that involved the retelling of stories (metaphoric vs. literal versions of the same story), the children had no particular problem with metaphor. Palmero (1986) says, given that sucb studies demonstrate the ease with which young children deal with metaphor, it seems highly unlikely that children learn only literal meanings at first. The question, he believes, is when do children come to understand metaphors as adults do. "Thus, [Shelley's] 'my soul is an enchanted boat' may be understood only by an adult, whereas 'my yellow plastic baseball bat is an ear of corn' may be understood by child and adult" (1986, p. 15). While children would assign some meaning to "my soul is an enchanted boat," it might not be appropriate from an adult's point of view. Palmero believes then that while children are acquiring meanings of a word, "they are ready to extend that word or domains of words to metaphoric uses."

1. Palermo (1986) says that in the story retelling task, the only item which caused children problems was a metaphor revolving around yesterday (behind) and tomorrow (in front). Several children explained that one can see yesterday but not tomorrow, so yesterday is in front. This seems to conflict with Clark's notion that spatial orientation provides us with our metaphor for space $\eqsim$ time. On the other hand, preschool children may not yet have learned that metaphor well. How would you design a project to research this question further?

2. Children begin pretend play at a very early age. They pour 'sand' tea and offer it to imaginary playmates. To the distress of their parents, they pretend their sandwiches are airplanes soaring through the air. Would you equate such nonverbal symbolic play with the use of verbal metaphor?

3. Teachers at a workshop reported the following metaphors used by very young children. A 3 year old looked at the moon and said, "Oh, it's a toenail moon!" Another child, seeing a parrot at the zoo, said "Look, a rainbow! A rainbow!" If you can observe young children, collect exampies of their creative use of metaphor. Can you categorize your collection in terms of different types of metaphor? Which type is most common in your data?

4. Since so many words have different meanings and can, on occasion, be used in sentences which allow tor ambiguity of meaning, and since so much of meaning in discourse is also ambiguous, we are constantly creating our own interpretation of meanings. Why, then, should interpretation of metaphor be a higher-order capacity? Try to relate your response to the acquisition research above. Do you agree with Ragevska (1979), who wrote that "metaphoric extension . . . is always at work in the acquisition of vocabulary and the development of thought' (p. 153)?

# Literary and conceptual metaphor

Metaphor is a pervasive process in language, yet we believe that writers have special talents in the creation and use of metaphor. What, then, is the difference between literary and conceptual metaphor? Lakoff and Turner (1989) say it is a matter of degree and skill; others say it is in the aptness of the metaphors.

To investigate this question in depth, Lakoff and Turner compared metaphors used in poetry and literature with those of ordinary talk. The basic underlying metaphors appear to be the same, yet the skill with which they are used certainly contrasts. As an example, let us review their treatment of the LIFE is a JOURNEY metaphor in literature and ordinary language use. The basic parts identified by Lakoff and Turner for the metaphor are as foliows:

# LIFE is a JOURNEY

There is a traveler.

The traveler moves through a series of locations; one or more may be an intended destination.   
Travelers with destinations choose paths to get where they want to go.   
There may be impediments to travel (bumpy roads, quicksand).   
The traveler needs provisions.   
The traveler may require a guide.   
Along the route, the traveler passes landmarks that help in gauging progress.   
Along the route, the traveler encounters crossroads and must decide which way to go.

In ordinary conversation, we use these metaphors in talking about life and our activities during life (e.g., education, marriage, work). We say that we "still have a long way to $g \mathbf { o } ^ { \mathfrak { n } }$ to make our work perfect. We may get sidetracked ("I really got off the track"), encounter impediments on the way ("we're going over some rocky ground there"). We may need help ("without my friends I'd really be lost") and worry about the choices we make ("I shouldn't have taken this route").

Robert Frost's poem ("Two roads diverged and I, I took the one less traveled") and the Twenty-Third Psalm (\*He leadeth me beside the still waters") exemplify literary use of these metaphors. Such metaphors are not different from or more apt than those of everyday talk. Rather, they are employed with great skill, and many (rather than just one) appear within one passage to produce a layered effect. Lakoff and Turner cite these examples along with many others to show the richness of metaphor in literature.

Other LIFE metaphors include LIFE is a DAY (see Dylan Thomas's poem \*Do not go gentle into the night," where the end of life is the end of the day), LIFE is FLUID in the BODY (see W. H. Auden's "As I walked Out one evening," where life is said to leak away as "the crack in the teacup opens"), LIFE is FIRE and LIFE is a PLANT (see the sonnet below). Lakoff and Turner not only illustrate the metaphors using the poems mentioned here, but they also discuss the combination of these metaphors using the standard example of metaphor in English literature: Shakespeare's sonnet 73. Literature teachers and writers on metaphor have long cited it as the supreme example of multiple metaphors for life within a single piece of literature.

That time of year thou mayst in me behold   
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang   
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold.   
Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang. In me thou seest the twilight of such day   
As after sunset fadeth in the west;   
Which by and by black night doth take away,   
Death's second self that seals up all in rest.   
In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,   
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,   
As tbe deathbed whereon it must expire,   
Consumed with that which it was nourished by.   
This thou perceiv'st, wbich makes thy love more strong. To love that well, which thou must leave ere long.

Lines 1 through 4 use the lifecycle year of plants (LIFE is a YEAR, LIFE is a PLANT) as a metaphor to describe life. As Lakoff and Turner point out regarding line 3, it is not cold, but wind that shakes trees; it is a person who is being shaken by the cold of approaching death. Lines 5 through 8 use the LIFE is a DAY metaphor; in lines 9 through 12 LIFE is FIRE, and the final lines (13 through 16) contain a plea for love that nourishes life (the traveler needs provisions).

Lakoff and Turner have selected an impressive collection of poetry to illustrate their belief that poets and ordinary people share models of the world, models which are represented through metaphor. Poets and writers are able to arrange and use metaphors in ways that have especial power and grace. Because we share the underlying models of life that are found in these metaphors, we understand and are moved by such language. Even when our models differ, we are able to recognize many of the metaphors of other cultures and appreciate the models revealed through them. Compare the Shakespeare sonnet with the English rendition of the following traditional Navajo prayer,

In beauty may I walk. All day long may I walk. Through the returning seasons may I walk. Beautifully will I possess again Beautifully birds. . .. Beautifully joyful birds.. .

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

On the trail marked with pollen may I walk.   
With grasshoppers about my feet may I walk.   
With dew about my feet may I walk.   
With beauty may I walk.   
With beauty before me may I walk.   
With beauty behind me may I walk.   
With beauty above me may I walk.   
With beauty all around me may I walk.   
In old age wandering on a trail of beauty, lively, may I walk.   
In old age wandering on a trail of beauty, living again, may I walk.   
It is finished in beauty.   
It is finished in beauty.

# Practice 5.5

1. Collect examples from oral language ot metaphors of life in another language. Are they the same as those given by Lakoff and Turner?   
2. Select one of the poems mentioned in this section and ask a speaker of another language to study it with you. Are the metaphors clear to both of you? If this poem were transIated into the other language, would the same metaphors be used as effectively in that language?   
3. Can you find passages similar to the Twenty-Third Psalm in the literature of other religious traditions? In what ways are the passages similar or different? Are there any examples of a guide that attempts to mislead one on the journey? Are the passages that describe this less poetic in nature than that of the guide we can trust?   
4. At his death, tformer President Richard Nixon was described as a giant, one who never traveled in the shadow of others but in whose shadow other political leaders labored. He left, it was said, giant footprints on the Iand, footprints that others might do well to follow. In American mythology, the giant Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox stride across the continent. They leave giant footprints which, when filled with water, form the Great Lakes. They carve the land, and the plowing they do directs rivers into their courses. Do all cultures use the metaphor of heroes strding out across the land, leading others to follow in their giant footsteps? What evidence can you give from mythology or trom everyday use to support your answer?

# Social models and metaphor

Although E. and H. Clark and other cognitive psychologists have been primarily interested in metaphor for what it can tell us about human cognitive processes, Lakoff and his associates have always considered metaphor to be both cognitively and socially determined. Kovecses (1986, 1988) talked about world models that are reflected in our metaphors. Though some metaphors are more central (or prototypic) than others, they are organized to reflect our common-sense understanding of life - a folk theory that acts as a standard for determining normality within a culture (D'Andrade, 1987). Thus, it is both a social and cognitive process.

Similar metaphors form the basis for understanding many areas of social life. For example, our understanding of politics is also organized around the journey metaphor. After President Clinton's 1994 State of the Union address, a yearly "state of the nation" speech, news commentators talked about his "leading" the country, his changing the "direction" of domestic policy, that Congress needed to "follow where he leads" so that the country avoids the danger of just "drifting along." They told us that Clinton needed to "lay out the map" so we can "see where we are going." Clinton himself used these same metaphors when he announced that with his 1994 budget proposal, "We have ended the drift and broken the gridlock of the past." While it nay be difficult to visualize a gridlocked highway which simultaneously drifts, the journey metaphor is clear. In fact, if you look at the parts of Lakoff and Turner's LIFE is a JOURNEY metaphor, you see that these also apply to politics: POLITICS is a JOURNEY perhaps because it reflects the life of our country. The only difference is that the country rather than the individual is the traveler.

In Lakoff and Kovecses's scenario of anger, the folk theory of anger consists of five parts: offending events, anger, attempt at control, loss of control, and act of retribution. In Shyu's (1989) investigation of metaphors of emotion in Chinese, we find a similar model. In Chinese, however, the causes of anger include the lack of good manners and social restraint. Anger itself is seen as fire or hot liquid in a container in English but as heated air in a container in Chinese. Chinese also locates the spleen in the many expressions of "hot spleen air." Both languages have metaphors in which anger is a dangerous animal with which we struggle, but the personification of anger in Chinese is much more common and the person is expected to struggle valiantly to control anger. In Chinese, an angry person is very dangerous and should not be touched or provoked. The basic system of the metaphor is identical to that of English although the details show cultural differences: in Chinese it is air that heats, the person must fight fiercely to control the emotion, and, if that fails, the angry person is seen as very dangerous indeed.

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

The metaphors of love as an emotion are also very similar in these two Ianguages but there is the added dimension of yuan (destiny) which differs from the English notion of hond. Shyu suggests that, despite differences in detail, one would expect strong similarities since so many of the metaphors are related to the physiological effects of the emotions. Looking at other metaphors (other than those associated with emotions) may reveal stronger sociocultural differences in the models revealed through metaphor.

# Practice 5.6

Quinn (1987) gives evidence tor a culture model ot American marriage using the metaphors of young husbands and wives (11 couples), interviewed separately (approximately 15 or 16 hours each) about marriage. As you might imag. ine, marriage is seen as something which is built ('solid foundation," "building on the relationship," "a do-itourselves project," "using parts"), an ongoing journey ('through the good and the bad, unable to continue"), an investment ("afraid it may cost too much," "being shortchanged in this relationship'), mutually beneficial ("tor both of us," and "vice versa"), knowing and seeing ("I didn't know who he was," "I didn't see," "My eyes were closed") and physical obstacles ("uphill stretches," "stormy weather"). In her analysis of the metaphors given by each person, Quinn discovered eight propositions about American marriage: marriage is a joint enterprise, it may succeed or tail, it is risky, it is full of unknowns at the outset, it is difficult and effortful, it is mutually beneficial, and it is enduring. She shows how each of these propositions are cast in metaphor by individual speakers. For example, the speaker may state through metaphor that lack of knowledge about marriage leads to difficulty, which leads to divorce. If difficulties are "worked through" in a way that is mutually beneficial, then marriage is enduring. Speakers talk about the work and learning needed to make marriage "stick," about ieaming a lot, and they also ask where they would "go" if the journey failed. Where else will one find a spouse as a fitting or irreplaceable part, both joined and beneficial, unless marrage is jointly lived? Does the analysis seem to fit your folk model of marriage? Read and discuss the model with someone from another culture. How different is this model from their own?

2. Collect as many metaphors of WORK as possible. How might these be collapsed into statements that would form a model ot work? Is the model culturally specific? Is it spe. cific to some particular type of work?   
3. A claim has been made that the United States is a violent and military culture. Reporters, as well as political leaders, often use WAR and GAME metaphors. One U.S. politician, for example, said, "We're out of the end zone but only at the thirty-yard line," making the event described into a football game. Another said, \*With all the smoking mirrors being thrown up around us-." Is this a combination of "smoking gun" and "mirrors," or confusion with "smoke and mirrors," or is there an expression "smoking mirrors'? Collect examples from news programs that use WAR or GAME metaphors. Do these same metaphors occur in news reporting in other languages? Does your collection \$upport the claim about U.S. culture?

# Metaphors of teaching and learning

Thornbury (1991) suggests that there are a number of recurrent metaphors that teachers use to characterize teaching. Included are LEARNING is a JOURNEY, the LESSON is a MOVING OBJECT, LEARNING is a MECHANICAL or COMPUTATIONAL PROCESS, and LEARNING is PUZZLE SOLVING. We can easily find examples of each of these metaphors, which include groups of metaphors within them. Just as we found many other metaphors under the LIFE is a JOURNEY metaphor, there are many other metaphors within the LEARNING is a JOURNEY metaphor. Here are a few collected by graduate students at Temple University, Japan, from classrooms, from comments teachers wrote on students' papers, and from their reading of applied linguistics texts on methodo!ogy.

The metaphors the graduate students collected far exceed those mentioned by Thornbury. They found many journey metaphors, metaphors of mechanical or computational processes ("processing input," "automatic production of well-constructed paragraphs," "language acquisition device," "adding new material to the lesson"), and puzzle solving ("clues to the question," "decode," "decipher," "keys to the puzzle"). Bur they found many other metaphors as well.

If we look through such metaphors, we see that many encompass reciprocal activies and roles such as teaching/learning, the teacher/the learner - doctors and patients, players and coaches, supervisors and workers. (Others emphasize the creative side of learning - weaving, painting.)

Block (1992) asked language teachers and learners what they think the role of a teacher is. Teachers supplied a number of roles: coordinator, facilitator, giver of information, disciplinarian, motivator, friend, coordinator, parent. Many of these imply corresponding student roles. Block also elicited the roles of students: worker, recipient of information, and so forth. He also surveyed the metaphors in a number of teacher-training texts. Block then compared existing models in the field of applied linguistics of teacher and learner roles to those offered by teachers and students.

Block's work is important to students and teachers, to researchers and teacher trainers, for we need to know what our folk model or folk theories (our shared commonsense ideas) about teaching and learning are. We need to know if the model(s) that emerge from our methods courses are

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

the same as those of practicing teachers and students. We need to know whether these models of teaching and learning (and the metaphors that come from the model) are universal or whether they are culture specific. lf we hope to bring about change in the teaching and learning process, tben we need to see precisely where our metaphors contrast and how understandable and sensible our new metaphors are to those who might implement them.

2. Select one methodology book and scan it for metaphors of teaching and learning. Do they fit into the groups you identified in item 1?

3. Collect teacher comments on student compositions. Do the metaphors tor writing differ from those of other areas? Check the major metaphors listed by Tomlinson (1986), who looked at salient steps in writing and metaphors authors use: Looking for ideas, they dig and dredge or hunt, cast nets. In nurturing ideas, they seed, prune, and cultivate. In combining and revising, they brew up and stew over their writing. They hope for a yeasting or brewing process to occur, and they put it in the oven to encourage fur. ther change. One writer noted that the final revision is tike the step in cookbooks to "correct tor seasoning." The choice of metaphor, in particular when writing becomes difficult, shows how writers think about their work. How do your metaphors fit into those listed by Tomtinson? Do teachers and professional writers differ in their use of metaphors to describe the writing process? How might you investigate this question further as a research project?

4. Program administrators often talk about "team spirit" as though staff members were playing a game. They may use military or religious metaphors, claiming the team has a "mission." Collect metaphors used by or for those in administrative positions. How do the metaphors differ from those of teaching or writing?

5. We nave many metaphors for the ways words might be represented in the brain. Sometimes we talk about the brain as though it were a warehouse. We "store' vocabulary and "retrieve' it from storage. In this metaphor, we think of words as physical objects, which can be lost or found in the warehouse or organized in different ways. If we do not think of words as objects, but rather as forms produced by connections as various parts of systems are activated (the brain as electrochemical wiring), we cannot talk about just two things - word and concept - but rather of multiple connections at many different levels. There are, of course, many metaphors tor the connection between words and their mental representations. In another language of your choice, determine what metaphors are used for the mental representation of words.

In this chapter we have said that metaphor is a basic process in language that reflects our perception of the world and our feelings, and is not a higher-order process (although skilled writers select and combine metaphors in a more artfu! manner than most of us can attain in everyday language use). The metaphors we use reflect our common-sense understanding of our worlds, and so they form a folk model or folk theory about life, about learning, and about our emotional experiences. Thus, it is much more than the relation Figur deseribed in Chapter 4. The relation is a pervasive process in language learning and language use. This notion is not, perhaps, something new but rather something rediscovered anew. In 1912, Weekley wrote, \*Every expression we employ, apart from those connected with rudimentary obJects and action, is a metaphor" (p. 97).

Chapter 6 will consider another group of relations which were not included in relational models: the semantic relations that occur across Ianguages rather than within one language. Chapter 7, the final chapter in Part l on semantics, will look at script semantics, another method that relates to our view of the world and our actions and interactions within it.

# Research and application

1. In Terban's (l990) Punching the Clock, a book for children 8 to 12 years of age, drawings illustrate the meanings of funny action idioms. Ask children in this age group to explain the metaphors without the illustrations. Do children need to be taught what these expressions mean? The Amelia Bedelia books, a popular children's series by Peggy Parish, features a girl who takes everything literally. The Stupid Family is another children's book where metaphors are taken literally. Why are stories in which things are taken literally so popular with adults and children? In contrast, The House is a House for Me is filled with metaphor that is not to be taken literally. In each illustration in this book, the CONTAINER metaphor is invoked for house (e.g., "The mouth is a house for the tongue'). Plan a research proposal to test the comprehension of metaphor by young ESL learners or bilingual children using these or other children's books.

2. Ackerman (l983) says that children have more difficulty with metaphor than adults, but claims this is because adults have had more experience with the conventional use of nonliteral meanings. Adult language learners, however, also have difficulty in recognizing nonliteral meanings while native speakers can accurately interpret figurative vs. hiteral meanings of phrases just from the intonation. If Ackerman is correct, we can attribute it to lack of experience with culturally specific use of metaphor. Or, we might claim that learners need to study the intonation that marks nonliteral meanings of phrases in English. How might you research the value of each of these explanations?

3. Shyu's (1989) and Kelly's (1989) studies of metaphor in Chinese and Turkish agree with D'Andrade's (1987) study in which he found that the Ifaluk of Micronesia had very similar general frameworks as those of American-European cultures. All of these groups divided internal states into thoughts, feelings, and desires. However, D'Andrade found that the detailed expression of these thoughts, feelings, and desire are quite different from those of English. Shyu and Kelly also found important differences in the details of low the metaphors of emotion were formed. Given your knowledge of other language groups, what sort of researcl plan can you devise to look at differences and similarities across lan

guage and culture groups. Might it be best to select some area other than those involving emotions for such a study? If so, why?

4. Paivio and Clark (1987) considered the role of imagery in the comprehension of metaphor using the terms topic and vehicle to refer to target and source. In the example "Divorce is the earthquake of the family," "divorce" is the topic (target) and "earthquake" the vehicle (source). The metaphoric comparison is that both are destructive. Paivio and Clark asked university students in introductory psychology classes to give the meanings of metaphors that were high and low in imagery and intelligibility, using 48 metaphors selected from the 204 poetic metaphors in Katz et al. (1985). The highest scores on meaning were for metaphors that were high in imagery for both topic and vehicle and high for intelligibihty. Examples of the "high" group follow.

High in imagery in both vehicle and topic:

The stars are beads strung on one string.   
Clouds are tossed pillows.   
The body is a fading mansion.

Examples of low imagery that were difficult for the students follow.

Low in imagery of both vehicle and topic: Contemplation is a transparent spider web. Memory is a heap of broken images. All prayers are the sarne grief fying.

Select an example from the high and low imagery metaphor groups presented in this article and replicate the study with one begirning, one internediate, and one advanced language student. On the basis of this minipilot study, decide whether a full study of metaphor comprehension by language learners would be a worthwhile research project (is it feasible, are the questions interesting, and so forth).

5. Harris (1975, 1986) gives many examples of metaphor in technical writing. He notes that popular names for the small bones of the inner ear - hammer, anvil, stirrup - retlect their shapes and are the same as the Latin names malleus, incus, and stapes. He shows that the letters of the alphabet have been used metaphorically for shapes (e.g., A frane, C clamp, O ring, I beam). He also offers numerous examples where the terms of technology and science are derived from human anatomy (e.g., pipe elbow, eye bolt, mouth of a tunnel, fuel bladder, lip of a crucible, jaws of phiers. pipe nipple, steering knuckle). Shape images may also be drawn from animals or plants (e.g., saw horse, plumber's snake, watch stem, branch circuit, honeycomb construction). Design a way to see if similar

processes are used in technical writing in your target language. Then, decide if you should consider preparing special materials on metaphor for your language for a specific purpose class. Design appropriate materials and try them out with students.

6. Brownell (1988) describes studies that show that patients with right hemisphere damage display metaphor-specific dysfunction, and that patients with either right or left hemisphere damage perform poorly compared with normal control subjects on both metaphoric and nonmetaphoric language. These studies and others suggest that one possible role for the right hemisphere is the processing of metaphoric language. However, Glucksberg et al. (1982) believe (as does Lakoff) that the same language processes are used to understand literal and figurative langnage. So, both hemispheres may process metaphors, but the right hemisphere may play a role in responding appropriately (once both hemispheres have finished processing). If you are interested in neurohnguistics and the differences between the hemispheres in terms of language processing, read and critique the Brownell (1988) and Glucksberg et al. (1982) articles. Are you convinced by the experimental and anecdotal evidence? How would you interpret the findings? Do they support the assumptions of cognitive psychologists such as Lakoff (or Weekley, writing much earlier) that all language is basically metaphoric and that it is not necessary to posit separate processes for hiteral and figurative language?

7. Throughout history, writers have suggested that certain problems in science could not be solved until scientists had the proper metaphor. Harris (l986) quotes Emerson's essay on language (section 4 of Nature, published in l837) to show that an awareness of the use of metaphor in science is not new. A metaphor can function as a helpful model for thinking about the problem, as in Harvey's sudden insight into the working of the heart as a result of seeing a fire pump. Or, Harris notes, the metaphor can impede progress, as in the persistence of the bird model hampering aircraft desigu in a number of ways. Consider the metaphors that are used for language and for language learning. How might they advance or impede our understanding of language and learning?

# 6 Semantic space across languages

In the previous chapters, we have discussed semantics in terms of features, semantic fields, core meanings, prototypic words for concepts, the basic semantic relations between lexical items, and figurative processes. Although we have highlighted cross-linguistic correspondences and differences as we discussed each of these analytic approaches, the question of universality of concepts and cross-linguistic correspondences has not been central to any of the approaches. The notion of universal semantic PRIMITIVES (i.e., basic concepts or meanings) is one of great interest to philosophers, psychologists, and applied linguists in their work on contrastive analysis, error analysis, and interlanguage research. In this work, the researcher attempts to find some small set of primitives that could be used to paraphrase or define all other concepts that occur in languages. The primitives would be universal and, thus, would give a basis for discovering the ways semantic space is divided in cross-linguistic comparisons. Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976) began their work by identifying those primitives that relate to perception. They identified almost 100 such primitives just to cover object recognition, including size, horizontal, vertical, top, bottom, rigid, straight. Lexicographers working in relational semantics protested that such primitives might allow one to identify perceptually, for example, a chair, but would not capture the meaning of chair. For that, they claimed, one must add relations such as those we discussed in Chapter 3 - for example, FUNCTION (a chair is to sit in) and HYPONOMY (a chair is a piece of furniture). Others claimed that the analysis should not begin with object identification but with action.

The basic criticism of each of these attempts has been that the number of primitives appear to be too numerous to be useful in describing meanings. Wierzbicka, a linguist who has devoted more than 20 years to the discovery of a fundamental set of semantic primitives, has shown, however, that while the task of defining primitives is exceedingly difficult, it is not impossible. She identified (1980) a set of thirteen basic semantic primitives that cannot be further divided and which allow one to paraphrase the meanings of all other concepts. These primitives and the combination of the primitives to form concepts in natural languages comprise what she calls natural semantic metalanguage. Wierzbicka's thirteen hasic semantic primitives are $I ,$ you, someone, something, world, this,

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

want, not want, think of, say, imagine, be part of, become. With these thirteen primitives and the names of natural species (e.g., cat, elephant, apple), she is able to paraphrase the meanings of concepts of natural language. She also illustrates how many of the problems of semantic analysis (such as circularity in definitions) can be solved using this method.

Because Wierzbicka's theory is the result of many years of careful analysis, it would not be fair to offer only a paraphrase of natural semantic metalanguage. Rather, we refer you to Wierzbicka's many books and articles for detailed study. However, the work relates directly to many of the sections of this chapter. In particular, Wierzbicka offers us a guiding principle in her translation of Apresjan's observations on elementary meanings:

The more elementary a given meaning is, the greater the range of the languages in which it can be expressed by a single word: elementary meanings are apparently expressed by single words in most languages of the world. The diversity and lack of congruence of the semantic systems of different languages arise at the leve! of combinations of elementary meanings. (Apresjan, 1974, in Wierzbicka, 1980, p. 69)

In this chapter, we will look at some of the universal categories that have been proposed in cross-linguistic work and then consider specific types of semantic correspondences across languages.

# Universal categories

Our semantic categories are based in our experiences with eacb other within our environment. Because all humans have the same basic perceptual apparatus, deal with the same spatial orientation to our environments, and share many other experiences, we expect that there would be some strong similarities in the structuring of semantic space across languages.

For example, one migbt suspect that all languages would have words for family groups, food classes, work groups, plants, and animals, and there should be universal categories of perception (see, hear), sensation (hunger, thirst), and emotion (love, hate). Yet, cultural differences are strong and the ways in which we divide up the world are often culturally specific. "The vocabulary of a language could be considered a kind of lexical map of the preoccupations of a culture" (Fowler, 1985, p. 65).

Given that we all have the same neural mechanisms for perception, we would expect that we would see or perceive reality in similar ways. Color perception is a good example of this notion. As we have already seen in Chapter 2, however, all languages do not have the same set of color terms. Yet, Berlin and Kay (1969) showed that color terms can be predicted.

Looking at 20 languages from different language groups, they found that if a language has only two color terms, they will be for white and black. If there are three, red will be added. Green and yellow are the next two color terms to be added, then blue and brown. Finally, terms for purple, pink, orange and grey may be added (in any order). Primary color terms predominate in terms of which colors are named in languages of the world. So, our shared visual apparatus does influence the naming of colors in languages. However, the number of colors named varies from one culture to another. Of course speakers of languages with few color names can perceive differences in color hues which are not naned in the language. Surprisingly few concept terms actually occur in all languages. You might not be surprised to learn that louse is one of them. Lice exist everywhere or at least speakers of all languages have them in their vocabularies! Swadesh (1972) first proposed a list of 200 concepts that he thought were basic enough to be universal. The list was then used to obtain data that would allow one to describe the lexicon (and the sound system) of another language and to trace the family relationships of Ianguages. Once linguists began working with non-Indo-European languages, however, they found that all languagcs did not have terms for all concepts. The number of concepts linguists use to begin their analysis has now been reduced to 100 (Table 6.1). Because it is possible in English to misread the concept in the case of noun-verb homonyms, the fifty-four nouns have been italicized.

As a language teacher or language learner, you know that the words that represent each of thcse concepts differ across languages. Students, however, are often amazed to learn that speakers of other languages do not recognize thcir language (whatever it may be) as having the "right" words for concepts. We often act as if we believe at least partially in the naturalist hypothesis that there exists a natural connection between word form and meaning. We may think that "cock-a-doodle-do" is the natural word for the crowing of a rooster, but we know that other languages use other onomatopoeia for this same concept. We may agree that the Big Dipper is the right term for that constellation and be surprised that speakers of other languages feel that the word for plow or great chariot is a better match.

Words from other languages may just not sound right to us. A DanishEnglish bilingual child remembers being unhappy as a child when her mother insisted she call flowers blomster. The child associated the sounds with bloomers (a word for girls' panties used in her community at that time) not with blooming. How could a word that sounded like bloomers be the word for flowers? Sound symbolism is part of our feel for the appropriateness of the words we use for concepts. There seems to he something right about words like glimmer, glisten, and glitter with the initial gli sound.

There is also something right about the /i/ ending which many languages use to show affection or small size (as in our baby, Buddy, granny, dolly). Fonagy (1963) found that Hungarian children thought words ending in /i/ were quicker, smaller, prettier, and sounded more friendly. Words ending in $/ \mu /$ were thicker, hollower, darker, sadder, blunter, and even sounded bitter. The // and/u/ sounds take on a meaning of their own through sound symbolism.

The mnemonist described in Luria (1968) was extremely sensitive to the sounds of words. For him the Russian word for pig, svinya, was not " right":

Now I ask you, can this really be pig? Svi-n-ya - it's so fine, so elegant. But what a difference when you come to kbavronya (sow) or khazzer (Yiddish for pig). That's really it -- the kh sound makes me think of a fat greasy belly, a rough coat caked with dried mud, a khazzer. . . . But take the word samovar. Of course it's just shcer luster - not the samovar, but from the letter s. But the Germans use the word Teemaschine. That's not right. Tee is a falling sound .. so how could Teemaschine mean the same thing as samovar?

(Luria, 1968, pp. 87-88)

Although most of us are not quite so sensitive to the sounds of words, it is true that some words in our language seem to be just right. Stilt, we know that there is no best word for any object. A table could as well be called a batel (or mesa, bord, tabla, tarabeeza). The choice is arbitrary, as long as it fits the sound patterns of the language.

Monolingual children (as compared with bilinguals) find it difficult to believe that it is possible to call a dog anything but dog. The word, for them, is inseparably linked to the concept. An adult friend who had never traveled outside the Midwest, returned from a trip to Mexico, claiming to be amazed that people there called a cow vaca when everyone knows it's a cow. According to the Bible, Adam was given the privilege of naming things before Eve appeared on the scene. But, Mark Twain (1905) wrote, once there, Eve knew that there could only be one possible name for each. She saved Adam from making mistakes on several occasions. "When the dodo came along, he thought it was a wildcat - I saw it in his eye. But I saved him. ... I just spoke up in a quite natural way of pleased surprise. .., 'Well, I do declare if there isn't a dodo!'" Twain's Eve was wrong about there being only one possible name for things; word forms are arbitrary. There is no systematic, direct correspondence hetween sounds of words and concepts.

Some languages may have many words for certain concepts. For example, English has one basic-level word dog, but many words to identify different types of dogs. We have one basic-level word tree, but different words for each type of tree. (Can you imagine how difficult it might be for a linguist to point to a tree and have the informant give the word for that specific tree, a different word for the next tree, and so forth. It is not always easy to get the term that you want!)

If the lexicon is a map of the preoccupations of a culture, we would expect to find differences in the degree of specialization of forms. For example, North American English has numerous terms for types of cars (see Aronoff's 1985 study of automobile semantics). Eskimo languages are often reported to have a very large number of words for snow, although this is denied by most linguists, who point out that there really are Only two root forms from which the other terms are derived.

Not only do languages differ in the number of terms they use for a concept, but the range of meaning of each term may cover the concept in different ways. For example, the English verb eat can be done by any animal. People eat meals, cows eat grass, fish eat bait, and so forth. That is not the case in German; essen is restricted to people and fressen is the

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

form for animals. Drink is restricted to liquids in English, but in other Ianguages (e.g., Arabic and Japanese), the word for drink is also used with cigarettes. Bathroom, in American English includes a toilet, a sink, bath, and shower. Nakao (1989) points out that the Japanese equivalent, $f u r o ( b a )$ , is a place to clean and warm oneself, but it does not contain a toilet.

Every language learner has embarrassing memories of errors made in assuming that some word carries the same range of meanings in another language as in the first language. For example, the notion of a watch "working" is ridiculous in Spanish. In German, gehen means to go by foot, not in a vehicle. So you can't use gehen to say ${ \displaystyle \mathbf { \mu } ^ { \mathfrak { s } } \mathbf { D } \mathbf { 0 } }$ you plan to go to America?" If you do, everyone will laugh.

# Contrastive analysis

Linguists have carried out lexical comparisons across languages for two basic purposes: to discover family relationships among languages and to locate the correspondences or lack of correspondence between lexical items in languages.

Although all languages have prototypic meanings for the central concept in polysemes (e.g., that the break of "break a leg" is more central than the break of "coffee break"'), the range of correspondence in polysemes does not correspond across languages. Still, we expect languages that are closely related to each other (like German and English) not only to have words which may be very similar to each other for a concept but also to extend the meanings outward from core to peripheral in similar ways. We do not expect this to be the case when we compare words for a concept across very different language families (e.g, English and Hungarian).

The languages within the Romance language group do, in fact, have many related words for concepts and the range of meanings of the words is often very similar. Nehls (1991) contrasts the designation of spherical objects in five languages, discussing his findings in light of prototype semantics (Table 6.2). Romance and Germanic languages all belong to the Indo-European language group. The examples sbow the close similarity of forms in the three Romance languages (French, Italian, and Spanish) in contrast to the two Germanic languages (English and German). Still, the similarity among all the languages for the word globe and, for English and the Romance languages for sphere is because English was heavily influenced by French at different periods in its history. Examples of less prototypic uses include those in compounds (Table 6.3).

Consider, now, the word head, one of the basic concepts on the Swadesh list. The prototypic meaning must be that of a person's head, but there are many other meanings for the word. If we look at the extension of the word for this concept across language families, we see that neither the range of meanings nor the forms for the items is the same (Table 6.4).

The core meaning of table must be that of a dining room table. This central meaning of table as a piece of furniture used during meals is shown in the primary word association, chair. If the core meaning for table was that of a chart, then chart or numbers might be the first word association offered. All cross-linguistic word association tests show that Spanish-English bilinguals associate table and mesa. The relation, however, does not correspond in other collocations (i.e., mesa is not used for a table of figures). The correspondences shown by Robinett (1965) are:

English Spanish table mesa tablecloth mantel timetable horario table of figures tabla turn the tables on volverse la tortilla

When languages are not closely related, we expect there to be fewer correspondences in the way that the semantic world is segmented. A lexical contrastive analysis reveals the similarities and contrasts between languages. Such information can help us to predict which lexical items will be easy or difficult for our students or ourselves as language learners.

# Practice 6.1

. Note the color terms included in Swadesh's list. Why are these colors included and others exciuded? A number of writers have given an "experience' explanation tor the predominance of color terms (red is the color of blood, yellow is the color of the sun, blue is the color of sky, black is the color of night, white is the color of the tight of day, brown is the color of earth, and so forth). Others have claimed that it is our visual system that determines the dominance of primary color terms. Cazden (1972) makes no claims about the order of acquisition ot color terms by young children, but she offers "archaeological" evidence of children's color preferences. Boxes of crayons (black, red, green, yellow, blue, brown, purple, pink, and orange) were issued to children at the beginning of the schoo! year. As children used up the crayons, new boxes were issued and the leftover bits collected for general use in a single container. At the end of the year, the container became packed with unused pieces of two colors, purple and orange. How does this evidence relate to Berlin and Kay's (1969) findings? The bilingual chitd Hildegard (Leopold, 1939, p. 688) was very interested in colors but found them difficult. Rot was her first color and was used for other colors as well. B/au was second, followed by white and weiss. Next came

orange. How does this evidence relate to Berlin and Kay's tindings? How might you account for the early appearance Of orange?

2. Notice that terms tor days of the week and for months are not on the Swadish list. How do you account for this? Do all languages have seven-day weeks? Does the week start with the same day in all languages? What about months? Prepare a chart that shows differences across languages to justify the omission of such terms from the list.

3. Russian has a word for each of the two days on each side of today while in English we use primarily phrases once we get beyond tomorrow and yesterday. The Russian words (supplied by G. Browning) are poslezavtra (day after tomorrow), zavtra (tomorrow), segodnia (today). vchera (yesterday), and pozavchera (the day before yesterday). Collect as many terms for days on each side of today as you can across languages. Display these in chart form.

4. Sometimes there is no matching term for an English concept we want to express in another language. Or, if there is, it does not include exactly what we want to say, or it includes things we do not want to say. Wierzbicka (1990a) says that the Russian word toska is a unique blend of melancholy, sadness, and indetinable yearning. The English word sadness does not capture this blend. Sadness may be translated as grust' and pecal' and a number of other terms in Russian. So, again, the correspondence in ways these emotional concepts are lexicatized is quite different Give an example of your own that illustrates this lack of correspondence. What solutions might translators use when there is no direct correspondence?

5. In another language, elicit the words for ball, head, and table and the other forms as shown in the examples in this section. What similarities and differences do you find? Can the equivalent for head also be used for "head of a pimple" (raas dimmi/ in Arabic)? Is the word for "head of an organization" more often modeled after the French "directeur"? Is head used tor "head of lettuce"? is table used in an expression equivalent to "table the matter'?

6. Miller (1991) looks at the different meanings of the noun board. He divides these into hierarchies of concepts rather than hierarchies of words:

The word board {board, committee} is a hyponym ot the concept {social group, group of people}; the word board meaning {board,

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

plank} is a hyponym of the concept {lumber, sawed wood}; the word board meaning {board, blackboard, chalkboard} is a hyponym of the concept {writing surface}; and so on. . ... In another Janguage, each board might be expressed by a different word. (1991, p. 187)

Elicit the words for these concepts in as many languages as you can. Prepare a chart that shows the correspondences and contrasts. Prepare a research plan (perhaps a match-the-lists test) to see if beginning learners from these different language groups make errors in using these forms in English.

7. The Japanese word for drink is used as it is in English for drinking liquids such as water. It is also used for consuming soup, cigarettes, and medicine. It is also used for the in-breath of surprise and (perhaps metaphorically) when one is unwilling but finally accepts a condition. In some theories all of these would be listed as terms for INGEST. Check to see whether this use of cne term for so many uses is common in other languages. If you teach students whose first language is Japanese, ask them whether this distinction between English and Japanese has caused them any difficulty. If you are studying Japanese, is this difference difficult to remember?

# Acquisition and error analysis

In identifying the thirteen semantic primitives of her natural semantic metalanguage, Wierzbicka (1980) noted that the primitives combine in basic ways to form propositions like:

I'm thinking of someone   
I'm thinking of something   
I imagine something   
I (don't) want this something   
I say something   
A part of this something is this something   
I'm thinking of you   
I'm thinking of a world   
This someone wants something

She notes that similar combinations appear very early in a child's first Ianguage acquisition. For example, Halliday's (1975) Phase I of child language includes the following expressions that fulfill basic functions:

Functions Lexical forms   
Instrumental I want, I don't want   
Regulatory Do as I tell you   
Interactional Me and you   
Personal Here I come   
Heuristic Teil me why   
Imagination Let's pretend   
Informative I've got something to tell you

(Note that the lexical forms can be reduced to the primitive propositions. "Do as I tell you" can be paraphrased as: I want you to do something; "Tell me why" can be paraphrased as: I want you to tell me something.) However, a child learning a second language must be able to deal not only with elementary meanings in the first language but also with differences in semantic organization across two languages. McI.aughlin (1984) proposes a three-stage model. At stage 1 the bilingual child works with an undifferentiated system where the lexicon is not separated for the two languages. At stage 2, the child differentiates the two systems but may mix lexical items occasionally. At stage 3, the two systems are differentiated. Mixing might still occur, but the child would know that the term is from the other language, would use it for special purposes, and mark it as mixed.

One question of concern for many parents and teachers is whether having to do this extra work places the child at a disadvantage, Numerous studies show that there is no difference in the number of words learned by bilingual and monolingual children. However, since the bilingual child is not only learning two words for the same concept but also must begin working out all the extensions of the words in the two languages as well, it is not surprising to find that the number of words for the bilingual child refer to fewer concepts. Pearson, Fernandez, and Oller (1993) note that the bilingual children in their sample had fewer different words within each language than monolinguals but, adding the words from the L1 and L2, the totals were equivalent to that of monolingual children. So the oft-cited notion that there is a lag in vocabulary develop. ment is not strictly true.

The question of when a bilingual child is aware of the fact that lexica! items from two languages are being learned is addressed in a number of diary studies. Ronjat's (1913) child, Louie, learning French and German, called this talking "comme papa et comme mama" and at the age of eighteen months asked for translation equivalents for concepts. He continued to elicit translation equivalents in a manner reflective of many field linguists. At 3 years: "Mama, puree de pommes de terre, wie heisst?" to get "Kartoffelbrei." After the mother named a dish "Gefullte Tomaten," he asked his father, "Comment tu dis, toi?" to get "tomates farcies."

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

Pavlovitch's (1920) study of a child learning Serbian and French showed an awareness of lexical differences by age two. Leopold (1939), studying his daughter's acquisition of German and English, claimed a growing awareness of separation of lexicon between ages 2 and $3 \%$ years.

Older children adding a second language, of course, are immediately aware of the differences in the way languages carve up semantic space. Eva, the 6-year-old Hungarian and French bilingual child studied by Kenyeres and Kenyeres (1938), was astonished that seven and week were not the same word in French as they are in Hungarian. And she found it hilarious that French should have the same word for tongue and language. Adults, too, find amusement, joy, and frustration in lexical correspondences and contrasts between languages they are learning. Our favorite example of this comes from Ringbom (1987) where an adult Finn says, "He bit himself in the language" (Finnish kieli means both language and tongue). Every language has its own way of dividing up semantic space and then extending meanings outward in interwoven nets.

McLaughlin's three-stage model gives us a broad picture of how learners separate the lexicon of the languages they learn. When we are tired or under stress, however, keeping all the information separate or retrieving the right pieces is not always picture-perfect. Many people who travel overseas find that it is not native language terms (or even those of their best known second language) that come out when they are trying to produce the target language. Rather, the terms are from other languages. For example, at the end of an extended trip, an applied linguist stopped in Mexico City for the TESOL conference. Exhausted, she decided to take an afternoon merienda. As she sipped soothing hot chocolate, even such simple expressions as "thank you" came out in French, Arabic, and even Swahili before the Spanish forms!

Although McLaughlin's model considers acquisition in terms of processes, many linguists look instead at the correspondences among L1 and L2 items and attempt to predict difficulty or ease of learning in terms of the correspondences. We will discuss these in the next section on loan translation and cognates.

# Practice 6.2

1. Pearson, Fernandez, and Oller (1993) looked at the re. ported vocabulary of 25 simultaneous bilingual and 35 monolingual (22 English; 3 Spanish) toddlers and infants, using the toddler and infant forms (Spanish and English version) ot the MacArthur Communication Development Inventory. The parents looked at a list of words typical for children in these age groups (679 toddler and 395 infant words on the English list and 732 toddler and 428 infant

words on the Spanish list) and identified those that the child used - parental recognition of words used rather than recall. If you were working in a bilingual kindergarten, would this be a useful way of measuring the language development of your students? Justify your answer.

2. McLaughlin (1984, pp. 181-182) claims that bilingual children initially transfer the meanings of lexical items in the first language to those of the second language. Thus Hildegard. Leopold's English--German child, used "Mommy alle," transferring the English all gone meaning to German. Standard German does not apply al/ gone to people in this way. Vihman's 3-year-old Raivo said that he could read and demonstrated this by counting, for in Estonian, lugema is used for both read and count (Vihman & McLaughiin, 1982). Give examples of your own (or ask your students for examples) that illustrate this phenomenon.

3. Shanon (1991) asked bilinguals to recall instances where they had made a faulty shift from one language to another. Examples included a speaker who had a conversation in English and, on leaving, meant to say good-bye in English but switched instead to Hebrew. Shanon also gives examples of students in foreign language classes, called on to respond in Japanese, answering instead in Russian, the previous language studied. How might such errors tit into McLaughlin's three stages of acquisition of lexicon?

4. Ringbom (1987) gives many examples of Finns using Swedish words in their English utterances. Consider your own language learning experiences, read through Ring. bom's list, and then explain whether this is different from lexicai language mixing.

# Error analysis, loan translation, and cognates

There are many problems learners experience with seeming correspondences in lexical items across languages. Once we have learned a word for a concept, we often find that we can extend the use of that word to the same contexts as its corresponding term in the our first language. For example, once we have learned that aito is the word on stop signs in Mexico, we may try to use alto in all the situations we might use stop in English. If we try to translate "stop it" directly into Spanish (alto este), the result will not be Spanish. Loan translation is a common lexical process in second or foreign language learning that often leads to error. Ringbom's (1987) error analysis data illustrates this. Having learned the

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

English word ball and the verb $n _ { y _ { \cdot } }$ a Finnish speaker produced the form flying ball which is a direct translation from the Finnish word for volleyball: lentopallo. The Swedish barnvagn means buggy (British English pram) and accounts for the loan translation error cbild wagon.

Cognates are words which have the same or very similar forms in two languages. In fact, if languages share many cognates, there is good reason to believe that they are related languages. As we saw in the ball example (Table 6.2), Romance languages share many cognates. A classic example is the word for flour: harina in Spanish, farine in French, farina in Italian, and farine in Romanian.

When we find cognate forms in a language we want to learn, we are usually delighted. It makes the language seem familiar and offers us a break - we already know the new vocabulary item. In Kotsinas' (1983) study of the early Swedish vocabulary learned by Katrina, an immigrant from Poland, and Dimitri, an immigrant from Greece, 50 percent of Katrina's words were cognates with Polish and 40 percent of Dimitri's were cognates with Greek.

Kotsinas does not believe that cognates are always as helpful as they may seem. Learners may overuse and extend these cognates instead of acquiring other more precise synonyms. For example, gangster was used for any unpleasant person and problem was used as a word for bad. The Swedish word $f r \mathring { a } g a$ , meaning ask, was used for the Swedish forms of tell, talk, discuss, say, and explain. The Swedish word komina (come) was used for the Swedish words come, go, travel, begin, start, and understand.

Forms that sound the same, and therefore appear to be cognates may, however, have very different meanings. Using them can have disastrous consequences as in Nash's (1978) title example: "Don't molest [bother] me now, I'm busy." These are called false cognates (or false friends). The form is very similar in the two languages but the meanings differ.

Ringbom (1987) collected a very large corpus of lexical errors of Swedish and Finnish learners of English. His analysis of false cognates in Swedish and English shows three different types of correspondences:

1. Cognate form but completely different semantics for the forms.

The unsure youth is made the offer (Swedish for victim) of fashion.   
Sugar is gift (Swedish for poison) and full of calories.   
I have also proved (Swedish $=$ tried) few times smoking.

While the forms of these words in the two languages are similar, their meanings are quite different.

2. Cognate form with very limited similarity in semantics.

He had 80 years birthday in this month so he is very actual person. (aktuell current, topical)

I spring and swim (springa $=$ run). He should learn how to handle in the right way (handla $\mathbf { \simeq }$ act)

Here the forms have some limited semantic relation to each other though not that intended by the speaker.

3. Cognate form with partial semantic equivalence.

Engineers plan more and more ways. (vag $=$ road} I could work what I will. (vilja $\lneq$ want to, sometimes will)

The word way is used for road in English in expressions such as "highway" "hyway" and "along the way," but would not be used in this context.

Another interesting utterance that might fit in this category is \*I have a car and my man has also a car." Man, a Swedish cognate with English, means husband in Swedish. In many English dialects it also can mean husband, but usually the phrase "my man" has a special intonation when it means husband.

Ringbom's detailed, rigorous work in contrastive lexicon gives us a useful taxonomy of many different types of transfer errors. His data come from learners of English with two very different first languages - Swedish, which is quite closely related to English, and Finnish, which is from a very dissimilar language family. Ringbom has looked at differences in error type in relation to the first language, as well as at the effect of third language learning on lexical transfer and interference. For example, if a Finnish speaker has studied Swedish and German and then begins English, will there be stronger transfer from these languages or from Finnish? However, Ringbom has not articulated hypotheses as to the relative difficulty of each type of correspondence in his taxonomy. For that, we will turn next to hierarchies that have been proposed in the literature of contrastive analysis.

# Practice 6.3

1. Leopold (1939) notes that Hildegard produced such blends as Buttertliege tor Schmetterling. How is this related to loan translation? Celce-Murcia (1978) notes that her daughter Caroline also produced blends like piedba// for tootball but attributes this blend not to loan translation but rather to Caroline's difficulty with the fricatives. The fricative /f/ sound of foot is more difficult than the stop /p/ sound of pied. Check the literature on loan translation and try to determine whether phonological difficulty plays a major role in forms used by learners.

2. In the language textbooks you use, what position has the materiais developer taken regarding cognates? Are they used extensively or are they avoided? If the materials are written to be used by students from many different first languages, do the authors make any direct reference to cognates between languages?

3. Nash (1978) suggests seven questions that we need to seriously consider when introducing cognates in language teaching:

a. Is the relative frequency of the term the same in each language?   
b. Are some synonyms of higher frequency than the cog. nate word?   
c. How many shared senses are there for the cognate forms?   
d. Are there splits in either or both languages and, if so, are they the same? (For example, concerto in English and concierto in Spanish are cognates but the Spanish concierto splits into concerto and conceit in English.)   
e. Are cognate nouns also cognate in terms of taking a plural form? (For exampie, vacances in French is plural, whereas the English form vacation can be singular or plural.)   
f. For cognate verb forms, are they cognate in terms of acting on an object (transitive) or not (intransitive)?   
g. Do verb cognates allow an animate or inanimate subject? Which of these is the most important in terms of deveiop.   
ment of language teaching materials? Justify your choice.

4. Examine each of the following Spanish/English cognate examples from Nash. How might they fit into Ringbom's classification of false cognates?

Smoking is not convenient for your health.   
Some type was acting silly in the bar.   
The materia/ of today's lecture is conservation.

If you teach (or are learning) Spanish, collect examples of false cognates that you believe should be identified in language teaching materials (ESL or SSL) to help learners avoid these problems. Do you think that pointing out false friends may discourage learners from making use of cognates which have similar distributions in the two languages?

5. The following examples are from a special university program in Mexico designed to prepare scientists to read chemistry materials in English. Although students were not expected to produce English, they were asked to write a brief essay on their program. Circle the cognates in the folIowing example data. How much do the learners appear to be using cognates? what are the possible advantages and disadvantages to using cognates?

a. The activitys that a chemical engineering student do in the school are so different I can mencione with culturals until cientific research.   
b. The environmental are very nice, everybody we're good brothers. The installation are so very old; our school have 52 years old. The teachers are goods (except somebody about $10 \%$ , thus the nivel is good in all the country.   
c. The project only is aplicated in this faculty for to see the results. The form is analized: preview, analisis of vocabulary, comprehension of text, parcial translate.   
d. The escencial point is for read of english. The text are estudied in one week generally.   
e. A estuding of ciences chemical is destacated to razoned for he. The teacher ot the ciencies chemical destacan in many ideas what to do, reaccioned to the estudent in the problems wnat have the student in the class. The actividites is not concenter also the memory in sheer razoned.

6. We often find that cognates that initially seem equivalent have different connotations. This is an especially important issue when translating passages. English has many cognate forms originally borrowed from French. English speakers use the French word regime to refer to a government in a negative way, but it is a neutral term in French. Consult an English-French bilingual dictionary to see whether this difference is shown. How useful do you believe the dictionary you consulted would be to someone engaged in translating?

# Predicting difficulty

Using contrastive analysis and error analysis, linguists have made predictions about difficulty of learning. Some of these predictions, as we have seen, have to do with universality of concepts. Others have to do with core meanings of lexical items. Others have been discovered by looking at correspondences across languages.

The types of correspondences each linguist considers depend on the goals of the research. The goal may be linguistic in nature - for example, a contrastive analysis of a particular lexical set. There are several studies that have looked at the ways in which languages express the concept TO PUT ON various articles of clothing. Japanese, according to an analysis by Backhouse (1981), uses haku for putting articles of clothing on the lower body, kaburu for putting things on the head only, and the more general term kiru for the upper body (or for articles of clothing such as a jumpsuit that would cover more than one area). English does have more than one term but none of these (don, slip on, slip into, get on, get into) are required for putting clothing on specific parts of the body.

The goal might be one of lexicography. Snell-Hornby (1990), for example, is primarily interested in finding correspondences between languages in order to prepare dictionaries that would allow for accurate translation. Snell-Hornby divided the L1 and L2 relationships into the following groups: (1) terminology or nomenclature (oxygen: Sauerstoff), (2) internationally known items and sets (typewriter: Schreibmaschine), (3) concrete objects, basic activities, and stative adjectives (chair: Stuhi, Sessel; cook, boil: kochen; technical: technisch, fachlich, Fach-), (4) words expressing perception and evaluation which are often linked to sociocultural norms (clout, thrill, bustle, bleak; keifen, kitschig, gemutlich), and (5) culture-bound elements (haggis, wicket, drugstore, Pumpernickel, Privatdozent, Sechselauten). Snell-Hornby believes that it is easier to find equivalents between languages in the first two groups with less correspondence for parts of group 3 (as we have seen in the comparison of cooking terms in Lehrer's 1969 work), and little hope of finding direct correspondences for groups 4 and 5. The work of lexicographers, thus, has been one source of prediction about difficulty in learning. That is, if we assume that the more direct the correspondence between lexical items in two languages, the easier the items will be to acquire, and terms for concrete objects, basic activities, and technical, internationally recognized terms should be much easier than those that are more culturally bound.

The goal may be pedagogical. That is, the contrastive analysis may present teachers with information about what will be the easiest or most difficult types of correspondences in learning. The goal is to predict difficulty of types of correspondence. Laufer (1991, p. 589) suggested that we can categorize the kinds of lexical correspondences between languages which would facilitate or impede learning (Table 6.5).

Thus, cognates (similar to the L 1 in form and meaning) would facilitate learning while false cognates (similar to L1 form with difference in meaning) would induce difficulty. If all the meanings of the words used for a concept are the same (overlap in semantic grids), learning should be facilitated. If, instead, the form in the first language becomes two or more forms in the second, there may be problems. So, Spanish speakers learning English might forget that two different verbs are needed for lo conociamos (we knew him) vs. Io conocimos (we met him). In partial overlaps, the Spanish word esquina is similar in most ways to the English word corner except that it means only the outside corner, not the inside one.

TABLE 6.5 LAUFER TABLE OF CORRESPONDENCES   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Facilitating factors</td><td>Difficulty inducing factors</td></tr><tr><td>Similar to L1 in form and meaning.</td><td>Similar to L1 form with difference in meaning</td></tr><tr><td>Overlap in semantic grids between the word in L1 and L2</td><td>Incongruencies in gridding: one to many correspondences, partial overlap, metaphorical extensions</td></tr><tr><td>Similar connotation</td><td>Different connotation</td></tr><tr><td>Meaning relation: hyponymy,. antonymy, converseness</td><td>Meaning relation: synonymy.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Similarity in sound to other words in the language</td></tr></table></body></html>

Cultural connotations can also make for easy or difficult learning, depending on the match. For example, iglesia means church, but it does not bring to mind the white wooden building with a steeple that is typical of churches in the Northeast and Midwest parts of the United States. And, finally, when meaning relations are those of hyponymy $X$ is a kind/ type of Y: chocolate mousse is a type of dessert), antonymy $x$ is the opposite of Y: humble is the opposite of proud), and converseness (e.g., $s e l l - b u y )$ , Laufer believes these will be easier than synonyms. Tables such as Laufer's are useful, but they do not make predictions as to which of the factors facilitate the most or induce the most difficulty in learning.

Stockwell, Bowen, and Martin (1965) in their contrastive analysis of Spanish and English made a series of hypotheses about the difficulty of acquisition of phonological forms depending on the degree of similarity between the two languages (Figure 6.1). The same hierarchy is perhaps less successful when applied to semantic correspondences.

Learning a new item is difficult in phonology (a level-4 difficulty), but a new lexical item will not cause the same level-4 difficulty that it does in phonology. A split category, however, will he difficult. Think of the difficulty young children have in distinguishing borrow and lend. These two terms are often covered by one term (in Dutch, lenen), and such splits are definitely more difficult than it appears from the chart. Learning to avoid production when a term does not exist in the L1 or learning to collapse several forms to one form in the L2 is not always an easy task. Learners keep looking for the missing terms. For example, in Japanese, the words for jaw and chin are both covered by the term ago. Americans learning Japanese say having only the one term just doesn't seem right to them. In German there is just one word, Uhr, for watch and clock. Again, English speakers learning German are likely to search for ways of making Uhr more specific, perhaps via their invented compound Armbanduhr.

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2">Ease-Difficulty 0-5)</td><td rowspan="2">Category</td><td colspan="2">Relationship</td><td rowspan="2">Process</td></tr><tr><td>Native Lang.</td><td>Target Lang.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Overdifferentiate new category</td><td>0-</td><td>1</td><td>learn new item</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>split category</td><td></td><td>1 2 3</td><td>make new distinction</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Underdifferentiate absent</td><td>1-</td><td>0</td><td>avoid production</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>coalesced</td><td>1 2</td><td>1</td><td>overlook</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Parajlei</td><td>3</td><td></td><td>distinctions</td></tr><tr><td>0</td><td>no difference</td><td></td><td>1</td><td>transter</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>reinterpret shape or distribution differs</td><td>1 -</td><td>1</td><td>give familiar item new shape or</td></tr></table></body></html>

Even when we accurately identify splits, splits may not all be equally easy or difficult. For example, the split of English know into French connaitre vs. savoir or German kennen vs. wissen would be listed as a 3 on the difficulty scale. The distinction between knowing people (connaitre, Rennen) and knowing information (savoir, wissen) is semantically transparent and therefore relatively easy. Ir probably is not that difficult to acquire. Sharpe (1989), however, shows that the split of know to shiru and wakaru in Japanese is less transparent. The difference is usually explained as between knowing and understanding, but this rule alone does not work. Additional pragmatic information on status and polite ness needs to be considered in making a choice between shiru and wakaru. In this case, learning which verb to use might be much more difficult.

The differences in connotative range show that even when terms appear to have one-to-one correspondences, native speakers do not interpret pairs in the same way. For example, Stockwell, Bowen, and Martin point out that policia de transito means traffic cop, but it is doubtful if drivers on the Los Angeles freeways interpret traffic cop in the same way as Spanish speakers might interpret policia de transito. It's not surprising, then, to find Spanish speakers in Los Angeles mixing "traffic cop" and "cop" into their Spanish. Policia de transito wouldn't have the same ring.

Connotation covers all the cultural associations called up with a word, whereas pragmatics deals with when and how items are used. Stevens (1991) found that both conflicting connotations and conflicting pragmatic norms need to be taught along with terms. He gives examples where Englisb speakers who have learned Arabic continue to misunderstand the pragmatic or cultural associations that go along with the use of such terms as ma-a'lish, which translates roughly into "never mind" or "it doesn't matter." However, ma-a'lish is also used for "sorry." You can imagine that such learners would continually interpret ma-a'lish as "never mind" or "it doesn't matter." In English these are used as a way of accepting an apology, not as a way of offering an apology. And Americans frequently become annoyed ("Whaddaya mean \*never mind'?") when someone says "ma-a'lish" as an apology.

As Stockwell et al. point out, it is impossible to work from such a chart as Figure 6.1 because differences in cultural connotations and pragmatic use must also be considered along with form and semantic correspondence. Therefore, Stockwell and colleagues analyzed the correspondences in lexical items across languages in several ranges: syntactic, morphological, denotative, connotative, and circumstantial. An example of contrasts in denotative range is shown in Figure 6.2. Such examples show how difficult it is to talk about simple splits in the way we can for contrasts in the phonological systems of two languages.

Nevertbeless, the Stockwell, Bowen, and Martin hierarchy (Figure 6.1) is helpful in conceptualizing possible difficulties for learners in very broad outlines. But the correspondences, especially if we include idiomatic and metaphoric uses, are much more complex than tbose presented here. Nevertheless, it is useful for comparative studies and in planning lexical choice in materials development. (For a table with more complex relations, see Stockwell, Bowen, and Martin, 1965, p. 284, and the examples following the table.)

# Practice 6.4

1. According to j. Deen, a pocketbook, meaning a purse or handbag, is een (hand) tasje in Dutch. Een pocketboek can only mean a paperback book. How might you visually diagram this correspondence? A calendar that we use to note appointments (diary in British English) is een agenda in Dutch. In English and in Dutch, agenda can be used for the agenda of a meeting. Een kalender is used for the calendar that hangs on the wall. Consult Figure 6.2 for help with a diagram for this correspondence.

2. The French word aussi can be translated as therefore, consequently, and a/so. D'autre part can be translated as moreover or on the other hand. Can you determine when you use each of these English connectors? Would it be easier for a French speaker or for an English speaker to learn these forms in the other language?

3. When we dress, we put on our clothes. Korean has several forms for the meaning of put on: Sinta is put on the foot, kkita is put on the hand, ssuta is put on the head, and jpta is used for everything else. According to the hierarchy of difficulty, how difficult would it be for native speakers of English to acquire these terms? Compare the Korean system with the Japanese system for put on. Who should leam the Korean system quicker, Americans or Japanese students of Korean? McCawley (1970) claims that it is the manner of putting on items (not the items or the part of the body they are put on) that determines the form. As evidence, he says that if you put socks on your hands or use a necktie to hold up your slacks, the Japanese term will be determined not by the article of clothing but by the manner in which it is put on. Do you agree with this analysis? Would this explanation help in teaching the Korean or Japanese terms?

4. According to Gasser (1988), the Japanese word mizu means water, while yu refers to water that is warm or hot. So if one wanted to say, "You put too much water in the tub." yu would be the appropriate terms (unless you like icy baths!). When temperature is not an issue, mizu would be selected. So, a Japanese speaker complained in English, "The faucet's broken." And, in response to the question "Which one?" replied, "Water' -- meaning the cold water faucet. Draw a diagram similar to that illustrated for table mesa by Stockwell, Bowen, and Martin (Figure 6.1). How difficult would it be for you to fluently produce the appropriate Japanese terms? How difficult would the correspondence be for Japanese students of English?   
5. Stockwell, Bowen, and Martin note there is no form for minister in Spanish. The cognate form ministro refers to a cabinet official. The word misionero is used for a Protestant minister. How difficult would it be tor English speakers to learn to suppress ministro to refer to a minister? Do you believe that all of the following lexical splits would be equally difficult? Be becomes ser, estar; for becomes por, para; you becomes tu, usted. If you think they are not equally difficult, give examples to justify your predictions.   
6. In Spanish or another language, what verb would be used for pass in the following expressions: "He passed a red light." "He passed me on the road." "They passed a law." "Pass the potatoes!" "She passed the course." "They passed the dividend on to their shareholders." According to your analysis, how difficult would it be for an English speaker to learn the forms in the language you described?   
7. Stockweli, Bowen, and Martin use the term circumstantia/ range to talk about differences among forms according to pragmatic circumstances. They point out that there is no direct correspondence between such politeness forms as perdon, lo siento, con permiso, and English "sorry," "excuse me." "pardon me." List the types of exchanges where each of these forms are approprate for English and then where the politeness forms are appropriate tor Spanish (or

another language of your choice). What is the correspondence between the use ot these terms in the two languages?

Stevens (1991) outlines the pragmatic contrasts between English and Arabic for time expressions. In English, we can say "in a minute" without realy having the pragmatic force of a promise or firm commitment. However, if time expressions are used in other circumstances, they usually do have this force. If we ask a clerk when merchandise wil be ready, and the reply is "tomorrow," we interpret this as a firm commitment. In Arabic, bukra is the term for tomorrow. However, in this same circumstance in a store, it might be a real promise, some vague tomorrow, or even a polite refusal to have the merchandise ready. If one wants to be sure of the degree of promise, some negotiation must be done. Another time expression in the utterance gives more commitment to the time frame (e.g., the equivalent of "tomorrow, God willing, in the afternoon"). The pragmatic force of promise or firm commitment is different in the two languages. While English speakers are often frustrated in this situation, frustration ot Arabic speakers is no less common in the face of the rudeness ot Americans who think a promise is a promise (when no promise or even a refusal had been signaled). Check to see whether the pragmatic meanings of tomorrow in another language are closer to those of English or of Arabic. How might you include pragmatic intormation when teaching such terms?

Lexical transfer and interference - the study of cognates and of borrowing of items across languages - are all important issues which appear in subsequent chapters. Examples are given here to show that these are semantic issues as well as lexical issues. Since borrowing is such an impor. tant lexical process, it is treated separately in Chapter 8.

# Research and application

1. Lehmann (1977) identifies the functional distribution of say, speak, talk, and tell in English and compares the distribution to the German sagen, reden, and erzahlen: In English, saying can be attributed to text ("the directions say," "the brochure says"). This is not possible with sagen. Speak is used to refer to faculty ("he speaks six languages") and qushity ("he speaks well; he is a

good speaker"), but "talk" is used for quantity ("he talks a lot; he is a great talker"). In German, reden can be used for quality and quantity. The English word tell is used to give information ("he told us the answer'), to command ("he told the kids to be quiet'), or entertain ("ne told a joke"). In German, sagen is used for information and commands and erzahlen for entertaining. How might you diagram these correspondences between languages using the hierarchy of difficulty? Alternatively, select another language (preferably a non-Indo-European language) and chart the correspondences for these related words. First, determine the words used for the general TALK concept. Then try to elicit as many synonyms as you can in the language. Finally, attempt to discover whether it is only the categories Lehmann described which account for the shift in terms. How closely does the distribution parallel that of English and German?

2. Ameka (l990) looks at four types of "experiences" which are linked to the roles of actor or undergoer. These include perception (see, near, perceive, etc.), psychological, mental, or emotional experience (love, hate, anger, fear), sensation (hunger, thirst, itch, pain), and activity (eat, work). Languages often use gramnar to show whether the experience is one in which the person acts or one in which the person receives or benefits from an action, or whether the speaker undergoes the experience. Ameka demonstrates this for Ewe (an African language). After reading his article, determine whether this is the case for English or another language of your choice.

3. Nilsen and Nilsen (1975, pp. 121-123) list verbs of experience. Use the groups of verbs categorized as psychological events (those that show a positive or negative reaction to experiences). Using this list as a starting point, design a research project to compare emotion terms cross-linguistically. (For a very different approach to the study of emotions, you might also wish to read Australian Journal of Linguistics 10 (1990), an issue devoted to the semantics of emotions which use Wierzbicka's natural semantic metalanguage as a basis of cross-linguistic comparisons.)

4. Zubin and Svorou (l984) compared spatial terms in English, German, Korean, Mandarin, Peruvian Spanish, and Egyptian Arabic. They use plots to show the correspondences (Figure 6.3). For example, the comparison of English wide and far shows that wide has a much broader range than far and that the two words overlap. The distribution for German is quite different. Draw a comparison diagram for the langnage you teach or are studying.

Compare your diagram with those in Zubin and Svorou for an extended cross-linguistic comparison. What predictions can you make about how easily these terms will be acquired depending on which language is being learned by speakers of one of the other languages. Are diagrams such as these useful in language teaching? If so, design a short lesson where you use such diagrams (or have your students produce them). How might you evaluate the effectiveness of the materials? If you are interested in these terms, compare Lehrer's semantic feature analysis of the German terms lang, kurz, breit, hoch, niedrig, gross, and klein (1974, pp. 123-124). Which type of analysis do you think is more useful in illustrating cross-linguistic comparisons?

![](img/3f9afa2cb6b883adc474d74dc9c87da73271e5e6e2f9c73741086afbb4fc39e6.jpg)  
Figure 6.3

5. To our knowledge, there has been no attempt to use relational models (discussed in Chapter 4) for the analysis of split categories across languages. However, it is possible to draw comparisons across languages using relations. For example, Durrel (1988) contrasts the following set of English and German terms:

![](img/635b83d15ea47d577de76fcd69423c66899e6f72f59300918fd856951006e22e.jpg)

(Source: Durrell, 1988, p. 238)

Given pairs of terms like long-short, tall-short, we immediately relste them as antonyms. But we relate long-short as qualities typical of certain objects and tall-short as qualities of others -- the relation between the quality and the object, A(typical quality), and the quantity relation of Minus or Plus. Thus, it might be possible to analyze splits using relational models. Review Durrell's examples of contrasts between Enghish and German. How might relational models clarify the lexical relations within each language and then between the terms in the two languages?

j. Stative adjectives refer to inherent properties such as size, shape, and substance (tall, circular, liquid). Snell-Hornby (1990) notes that these should be easier than dynamic adjectives. Dynamic adjectives are not inherent but are temporary or changeable or based on value judgments. The value is relative to some implied norm set by the speaker or imposed by the social environment and implicitly accepted by the speaker (e.g., vulgar, naughty). The notion of dynamics can also apply to verbs (gleam, bustle, waff) and nouns (hag, thug, hovel). Snell-Hornby states, "In language learmng and translation, dynamic adjectives, descriptive verbs and nouns with dynamic evaluation are a notorious source Of difficulty and error - and they are at the same time given tinsatisfactory treatment in bilingual dictionaries." Snell-Hornby argues that perception verbs are especially difficult to represent across languages. Consider her example of the perception of light and heat, starting with the word gleam. Gleam is light that is stable, though it may be perceived only briefly or temporarily: the light may be soft and subdued but not lacking in intensity. The light may be emitted and reflected with warmth (evening sunlight, light reflected on gold, on hair, on brass). She then sets up a chart for English and German:

flash - twinkle shine sparkle shimmer gleam glow glimmer beam smoulder   
ghisten ghitter glint glare - blaze flicker flame - flare

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

blitzen - funkeln - scheinen   
blinken schimmern glanzen flimmern leuchten   
schillern . glitzern strahlen flackern -- flammen -- gluhen lodern glimmen schwelen (Snell-Hornby, 1990, p. 220)

First, how might you research the hypothesis that stative adjectives are easier to learn than dynamic adjectives? Note that Durrell's examples in item 4 are stative adjectives, yet they are predicted to be trouble sources for learners. Do you think the Iack of correspondence between the two languages for the terms of perception of light will cause more problems for German learners of English or for English learners of German? Check to see if all the terms listed are included in a bilingual dictionary under the word shine. Do the entries adequately identify the differences in this lexical field?

7. Ard and Homburg (1983) compared Spanish and Arabic ESL students' performance on the vocabulary section of a language test. Spanish students had higler scores since, by recognizing cognates, they could guess mearings. Arabic students did not score as high. After reading this article, analyze the general proficiency or placement tests that are used at your school. Are the test items biased in favor of any particular language group. If they are, justify your own decision as to wlether the items should or should not be rewritten.

8. Dole (1983) lists examples of transfer or interference from a second to a third language. Examples of interference from French in the English of a native speaker of Pohish include the following:

Urgency entrance of the hospital .. wants a piece of glace We should buy a pamp/emousse. I can't assist the meeting. Then I worked for the ambassade.

Examples from French to English in the speech of a German include:

Serve yourself. (Sers-toi in French and Bediene dich in German) You must ask him for an explication. (explanation) You inscribe for the course. (register)

French to English for native speakers of Spanish included:

They're not too pressed to send the forms. (pas tellement presse, no tienen prisa) The trip arrived the same week as my trip to Chile. I'm going to pass a month in Majorca. (voy a pasar)

It is sometimes difficult to know whether to say that interference is from the second language or from the first when the native language and the first foreign language are as closely related as French and Spanish or German and English. Compare the errors of the preceding Polish speaker with those of the Finnish speakers in Ringbom's study. Do you see resemblances? Design a research project which would parallel Ringbom's with another language which is not in the Germanic or Romance language families.

9. Bentahila (1975) examined the interference of French on the learning of English by Moroccans. Ulijn, Wolfe, and Donn (l981) studied the effect of French as a second language on the English of Vietnamese immigrants to the United States. Ringbom (1987) discusses the role of the second language, Swedish, on the English of Finns. Review these studies and any others you discover. (Another unpublished study is that of Gasser, described briefly in Hatch, 1978, p. 450). Wimmi, an adult native speaker of Punjabi who also spoke Hindi and English, moved to Ethiopia and began to use Amharic immediately in her hospital work as a nurse. She learned the Amharic word that means to visit. She then extended it to the meanings of the act of seeing since, in English, we often use see for visit. Prepare a research plan to look at the effect of second languages on lexical learning in a third language.

10. Using Wierzbicka's natural semantic metalanguage, Dineen (1990) draws cross-linguistic comparisons between English discomfort terms embarrassed, ashamed, and shy and their Danish "equivalents" flov, forlegen, ilde berort, pinlig, and skamfuld. The differences shown reflect, in part, the Danish willing. ness to talk quite openly about things which are semi-taboo in English. They discuss their bodies quite openly, feeling that bodies cannot cause one discomfort though people can. The concepts of shame and embarrassment seem to be different in the two languages. To illustrate that cultural values, even for groups as similar as Danish and English, are important, Dineen compares two phrases, "to be past shame" and have bidt hovedet af a! skam, phrases which appear to be equivalents. To say one is past shame is a terrible judgment in English while have bidt hovedet

af al skam is praise in Danish. It means one is willing to put aside shame or embarrassment in a situation one would normally avoid for the good of others. Harkins (l990) writes about the concept of shame as used by Aboriginal speakers, a use in which a person has been singled out for any purpose (whether scolding, praise, or attention) and thereby loses the security and anonymity of the group. This concept is shared by many cultures and is problematic for many teachers whose cultures and languages do not lexicalize this concept in the same way. If you are from (or teach students from) another culture, compare the concept and lexicalization of shame and embarrassment with that found in these studies. In what way would this information be of practical use in the classroom?

11. Lehrer (1974, p. 65) compares American Enghish and Scottish terms for bakery products using semantic features (e.g., $+ / -$ -yeast, $+ \beta$ sweet, $+ / .$ -soft). She also compares cooking terms in French, German, Farsi, Polish, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese, Jacaltec, Navajo, Amharic, and Yoruba (pp. 155ff.). Select either bakery products or cooking terms and, after you have read her descriptions, add another English dialect or another language and carry out a similar analysis. What splits, collapses, and other correspondences have you discovered? What advantages do you find to combining semantic field analysis and cross-linguistic comparisons?

12. Szalay and D'Andrade (1972) found that Americans and Koreans held different connotations for many words. To find the connotations, they asked each group for word associations to many words with social content (e.g., social, to cooperate, equality, socialism, pride, faith). The associations, and thus the connotations, for the terms differed. For example, educated held connotations of learned school knowledge for Americans, while the first Korean association for the term was polite. Yamamoto and Swan (1989) also found that foreign teachers of English in Japan had very different connotations for descriptive adjectives used in their study. For example, naive was thought of as a negative term by most of the foreign teachers but was more neutral for the Japanese teachers of English. These studies aliow that social terms or descriptive adjectives might be a good place to begin to study differences in connotations across language groups. Read and critique these and other articles as preparation for a research project of your own.

# 7 Script semantics and conceptual structure

In this chapter, we will attempt to incorporate many of the analytic methods discussed in previous chapters. As applied linguists, language teachers, and language learners we know we must somehow relate concepts, the vocabulary for concepts within the language we use in speaking and writing of our experiences. Cognitive psychologists, lexicographers, linguists, and researchers in artificial intelligence who attempt to model natural languages on computers are also faced with the problem of connecting concepts, the words representing concepts, and text.

As models have been proposed and refined by these psychologists, computer scientists, lexicographers, and linguists, a new field has evolved, known now as cognitive science. In the field of cognitive science, we find that language and semantic memory are envisioned as networks' and these networks are formed and activated in terms of some larger overall organization of events.

In this chapter we will consider two theories of what these networks might look like. First, we will review Schank's conceptual dependency theory, a theory that is action-based but which also relates concepts to the language of everyday activities represented in scripts. Then we will very briefly introduce Jackendoff's conceptual structure hypothesis, a more linguistic solution to the problem of relating mental concepts, lexical items, and sentence syntax but, in this case, without appeal to any larger context.

# Scripts

The notions of scripts and schemas, which has influenced our work for decades, is the theoretical basis of much research on reading and composition. In script theory, we extend the notion of prototype beyond that represented by words. You might think of a script as a general prototype or template for an event. Concepts are part of the script for an event and the vocabulary for the concepts is \*activated' along with the script. And, as we have seen in previous chapters, the vocabulary for concepts becomes the source vocabulary to be used as metaphor across scripts to new target concepts.

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

With the script theory presented here, we will attempt to bring together much of what we already presented about semantics. While there are many different theories of script representation, we will combine that of Schank and his colleagues (1977, 1984), a theory sometimes called conceptual dependency theory, with that of Anderson (1983), particularly his work on augmented transition networks (ATNs). Once we have presented the general theory, we will look at how it relates to semantic theory in detail.

Although the following description oversimplifies this approach, at least a general outline of scripts is necessary in order to understand how semantics and lexicon are viewed within it. If you think of a language classroom, you realize that there are people who play established roles within the classroom script. TEACHER, STUDENT, TEACHER'S ASSISTANT, PRINCIPAL, and CUSTODIAN are examples of such roles. (These roles are placed in capitat letters because they represent conccpts, not vocabulary items.) In a courtroom, the roles include those of JUDGE, DEFENDANT, and so forth. In the hospital, DOCTOR, NURSE, PATIENT, and other roles are found. The vocabulary (teacher, student, and so forth) that represents thesc role concepts can then be activated for the script. This is formalized with an ISA link so that "teacher ISA TEACHER" shows that the lexical item teacher is an instance of the concept TEACHER. "Cheryl ISA TEACHER" shows that Cheryl is an instance of TEACHER and inherits all the characteristics of that role.

In some scripts where the role has dress requirements, "JUDGE HASA ROBE" and "NURSE HASA UNIFORM" would also be inherited by whatever name is placed in the judge or nurse role. Roles also have particular PROPS assigned to them. TEACHER HASA DESK, JUDGE HASA GAVEL, and NURSE HASA CHART are examples of props assigned to these roles. Notice that the relation of props and clothing are formalized with the HASA tink. (The attachment of props to roles explains why we use a definite rather than an indefinite article for props: both roles and props are "known" items once a script is activated. We wouldn't say "A judge raised a gavel" in describing a courtroom scene. Instead, we would use definite articles even though neither judge nor gavel have been given previous mention: "The judge raised the gavel.")

In addition to having props, role players carry out actions within the script that are usually in a temporal order. If you place all the actions that take place in the classroom in chronological order, you might have a set of acts similar to those a teacher or student normally does. These actions, the actions of all those who have roles in the script, form the backbone of the template script.

Some of the actions are physical. For example, the teacher may walk about the room. MOVE is a volitional act. The concept MOVE may be actualized in a variety of different vocabulary irems. The choice of items for a concept field forms a schema. As you can see, the schema relates to the earlier discussion of synonyms (Chapter 1) and semantic field analysis (Chapter 2). Thus, we can incorporate semantic feature and field analysis into scripr theory. There are many words that mean to move in a certain way as shown in Figure 7.1. We can also relate the choice of items in the concept field to the categories of superordinate, basic, and sub-basic levels discussed in Chapter 3. Given what we know about superordinate, basic, and sub-basic levels, the lexical item most often selected would mostly likely be walk: "The teacher walked around the room."

The teacher may also, for example, move books from a table to a desk. This move is a physical transfer of material, a concept called PTRANS. The actual movements within this general concept for moving items are then further specified (i.e., the teacher must KNOW where the object is, PROXimate or locate it, and take CON'Trol of the object). At the lexical level, prototype theory would give us such words as pick up (for the GRASP move in taking CONTrol of an object) and put (for the PTRANS of an object to a flat surface) as the most basic lexical choices, yielding, "The teacher picked up the book" and "The teacher put the book on the table."

Teachers hand papers hack to their students. In this case, the PTRANS of moving the object from one place to another is accompanied by a ATRANS move. ATRANS refers to a transfer of ownership schema. The lexical relation conversc (from Chapter 4) is shown in the choices give to and take from, or give and receive. These are typical verh choices for the transfer of ownership concept.

In classrooms, we hope that there is a healthy exchange of ideas. Ideas are not objects that can be picked up and noved from place to place yet, as we saw in the Chapter 5, we typically refer to them as such via metaphor. M'TRANS is the concept for mental transfer of information. Possible converse vocabulary for this concept include teach and learn from, or explain and understand. If, instead of MTRANS, we use a metaphorical extension of P'TRANS where ideas are talked about as though they were physical objects, we might use the converses of give and take-receive. In neither case is there a transfer of ownership for the information is now shared, not the property of only one or the other.

There are other action concepts that, for simplicity, we will label as DO. For further explication, see Schank (1984). DO is just a prototypic verb concept; the actual concept would have to be specified in further detail in any analysis.

The notion of EVALUATION is another important part of every script. As we carry out the actions of any script role, we constantly determine the "goodness of fit' to our mental model of how this script should play out. If we are at a restaurant, we evaluate the event by matching the meal, its presentation, the service, and so forth, to each part of the script template;

![](img/a2e0660a51099f3142d2d0d132357348d7e3379c4cda524e589422118f11597c.jpg)  
Figure 7.1 MOVE schema

we also evaluate the evenr in terms of how well it meets our goals in participating in the script (Are we still hungry?). The motives that go with roles are also important in evaluation. Very often we judge motives according to the role played rather than the person playing the role. So, if the teacher holds upher hand, we do not expect a student to interpret this as a signal that the teacher wishes to answer. Instead, the sign is recog. nized as a call for attention and quier. The motive for the action is bound up with the role. Actions we cannot assign motives to can be quite disturbing because we do not know exactly how to interpret them within the script.

In another script, the person who plays the TEACHER role may now be a PARENT. Although some characteristics of the two roles are similar, others are not. Or, the STUDENT, out of the classroom and now on the playground, may change roles to those of STAR ATHLETE, BULLY, or LEADER. We play a wide variety of roles as we change from script to script. We hope that in each script, we will not be seen as that role, but rather as the person who defines self through the ways in which we play a multiplicity of roles. Nevertheless, it is difficult not to assign motivations to people in terms of actions of the roles they play in other scripts. For example, if we know someone is a star athlete, we are apt to judge that person's motivations in other scripts as though he or she were still playing that role. We judge teachers in the same way. Or we simply think they are absorbed into the blackboards at the end of the day to re-emerge the next - that is, they have no other roles in life.

# Practice 7.1

1. Berko-Gleason and Weintraub (1976) described the trickor-treat sequence of Halloween. The child's goal, when first taker on this traditional venture, may not be very clear. The goal may be to have fun or to get candy or to dress up and scare people. The child may not know the "trick or treat!" opening demand or the "thank you" that comes at the end of the script. Parents or older siblings walk the child through the script from beginning to end many times during the evening. Select another traditional script (e.g., 5K race, wedding reception, Super Bowl party, pancake breakfast fund raiser) and list the obligatory roles, props, and actions. What prototypic vocabulary might be used for some of the concepts you have identified? what stereotypic utterances are used by people playing some of these roles?

2. If you work with very young children, document the amount of script teaching that adults or older siblings do. For example, do they give the child a toy phone and instruct her to "Say helio to Daddy"? Are they the ones who link actions to motives or states ("Oh, he went back to sleep. Guess he's tired.')? In your examples, is the teaching directed at the script components or at the language needed for the script? Do older children coach, model, or teach younger children the specitic language needed for the script?

3. How often do children pretend to be (i.e., play the roles of) mother, father, older sibling, or pets? What role attributes do they assume in this play? If you observe children of different ages, do they refuse to play the role of BABY at a certain age? When? Is the age of refusal different for girls and boys?

4. What scripts do young children practice: ironing, cleaning house, going to the store, going to the doctor, driving the car, chasing robbers, going to school, playing teacher? Do they also use correct gestures or other nonverbal signals that go with the role? Von Raffler-Engel (1977) has studied the early emergence of language and culture-specific gestures in young children. For example, a 27-month-old Japanese child playing with a toy phone bows to her listener. If you have observed similar language-specitic gestures in the play of young children, do these gestures go with particular stereotypic utterances or specific vocabulary items?

5. Being abie to play roles in second language scripts is often judged as a mark of good language learning:

# Example

Observer: Do you guys want to play doctor? Juan: I wanna be the doctor.

Vocabulary, semantics, and language educatton

Carlos: (on phone) Ailo doctor, I'm sick.   
Juan: Come.   
Carlos: OK, I be right there.   
Juan: Bye.   
Carlos: (hangs up phone and pretends to knock at the door   
Juan: Come in.   
Carlos: (turns to observer with a proud grin) Hey, he knows a lotta English! (Data source: Wong-Fillmore, 1976)

Look at the example and list the roles, props, and actions for the script. What are the prototypic utterances that go with the actions of the script. In what way do they differ from those given by these child language learners? What other phrases might they have used to show their script competence?

6. Some people learn particular second or foreign language scripts very well. A colleague was judged to have excellent colloquial Arabic because of her ability to play the customer bargaining role very well at the market. Are there special scripts in which you or other language laamers either excel or fail? How do you account for the variability across scripts? Is it a matter of not knowing the script components, the prototypic utterances that go with the roles, or the right lexical choices for the nuances needed to show status or politeness conventions within the script?

7. Videotape your students (or yourselt as a learner) in a role play of your choosing. What special script language do the learners use? What other choices of lexical items, phrases, or utterances might be used instead for a more Successful performance?

8. In Chapter 5, we noted the ways we talk about teachers and learners via metaphor. In scripts, we also must specify the attributes ot script roles. What attributes would you list for the TEACHER role in the classroom script? What attributes would you a\$sign to the STUDENT role? what range of lexical items can be used for each attribute? Are there special attributes that need to be assigned to the bilingual classroom teacher and to the bilingual student?

9. How might a teacher create a new type of student role for students with special attributes? For exampie, consider the child who has lived in another country - say, China - and then returns and enrolls in a Chinese foreign language

class. The learners' Chinese, acquired in that country, might be more fluent and colloquial than the teacher's. How might such attributes change the student and teacher roles in the classroom script?

# Scripts and semantics

How does script theory relate to semantics? First of all, the script specifies concepts, which then activate lexical items associated with the concept. Thus, once a service-encounter script, say, grocery shopping, is called up in response to the goal of obtaining food to satisfy the need of hunger, all of the typical roles would be activated: SHOPPER, CLERK, and so forth. All the prop concepts would be called up: GROCERY CART would be connected to the shopper as a temporary ATRANS of ownership. REGISTER (some sort of computer, register, adding machine) would be connected to the CLERK. The SHOPPER actions (MOVEing down the aisles, PTRANS of objects from shelf to cart) lead to CLERK actions of PTRANS of objects from cart to bags or boxes. The ATRANS of ownership of the items is carried out through a CHARGE PAY (give and receive payment) exchange. Thcsc concepts are not words. The actual words are viewed as instances of the concept. There are also stereotypic sets of phrases that go with particular roles. "Have a nice day" is a formulaic closing utterance for the clerk; "I now pronounce you husband and wife" is a formulaic utterance of the minister role in the marriage script; "Time to turn in your papers" is a formulaic utterance for teachers in the classroom script. The lexical items, whether utterances, phrases, or individual lexical choices are activated as we move from concepts to the words that express them. Although much of the language is predictable, each instance is sensitive not only to the script but also to the motives of the players. In each instance of playing a role in a script, we are also sensitive to evaluation.

Second, there are many terms available for every concept. The diagram for these terms is often called a concept schema. Traditionally, we have called the choices in the schema synonyms, but they are not really synonyms within a script. The scripts themselves restrict the vocabulary choices that can be made. For example, Figure 7.1 shows some of the choices for the concept MOVE, but is unlikely that the words swim, $f l y ,$ or crawl would be activated in a classroom script.

We mentioned that EVALUATION is ubiquitous in scripts. We constantly evaluate our performance and the performance of others in creating a new instance of any script. In evaluation, the choice of lexical items, whether you prefer a field semantics approach of taxonomic boxes or tree diagram options, would be along a scale rather than synonymic.

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

Third, lexicographers using relational models highlight synonym, hyponomy, function, attribute, and various types of part-whole relationships among lexical items. In script theory, this is handled by listing the attributes of roles and props. For example, roles are most often played by HUMANs. Human beings have bodies and these bodies, in turn, consist of parts such as head, neck, trunk, arms, legs, and so forth. These parts are further divided into parts so that fingers, thumb and palm are parts of the hand. The hand, forearm, and upper arm are parts of the arm. These can be specified by HASA and ISA links for concepts. HUMAN HASA BODY; BODY HASA PARTS; HEAD ISA PART; TRUNK ISA PART; ARM ISA PART; ARM HASA PARTS; HAND ISA PART. The hand is then redefined according to its parts. Each time a human is activated, these attributes are there. Speakers or writers need not explicitly mention attributes of roles nor the connections among them; they are already given or presumed present.

Earlier we noted that lexical relations include not only synonyms and antonyms but also thc mutual rclation of converses, which are tied to our notion of script. Teacher and student are not really opposites; rather, they are roles with reciprocal functions within a script. Tbe roles involve the converse actions of teach and learn. Since we learn as much, if not more, from our students as they do from us, the actions of teaching and learning are, in actuality, not tied to the role of teacher and student. Rather, the roles and actions are reciprocal. That is, we can change teacher and student roles within any classroom script. Nevertheless, the typical template assigns teaching (and the authority that goes with the role) to the teacher and learning to the student. In other scripts, the roles might be SELLER and CUSTOMER who SELL and BUY props in the script. Again, in bargaining, there is a reciprocal shift as the buyer hecomes the offerer of a potential price. The seller shifts from offering the merchandise to considering whether or not to "buy" the offer. The actions of players of these roles reciprocally build the script in each new instance of playing the roles.

Professional office visirs also demonstrate the reciprocal nature of ac. tions attached to ROLES. The doctor or dentist or lawyer or teacher QUESTIONS the patient, client, or student regarding SYMPTOMS and offers REMEDIES. The actual building of an advice-giving event, however, is negotiated by the people playing the roles. There are cycles of evaluation and negotiation throughout the script. The advice seeker and the advice giver listen, accept or reject, and evaluate symptoms and remedies. The script is much more complex than a simple LIST-symptoms and LIST-cures set of actions.

We mensioned that scripts that share much in common can be grouped together into a larger class. For example, all scripts that involve a contract of exchanging money for service (shopping scripts, entertainment scripts, professional-office-visit scripts, and so forth) might be grouped together as service-encounter scripts. Vocabulary searches can then easily be run across all the scripts within a group of like scripts. There are case study examples where language learners report doing just that. Zernik (1987) reports hearing the term "rip you off " as part of a description of a service encounter with a garage mechanic. Given the negative intonation, Zernik realized the meaning had to be a negative evaluation term. He hypothesizes that a learner would tben check evaluation terms for contracts: service (not done, poorly done) relative to charge for service. The lexical item cheat might spring to mind and the learner could then begin to listen for contrasts between rip off and cheat throughout all service encounters.

This grouping of similar scripts also lets us relate the notion of source and target transfer of meanings in metaphor. If metaphor is as basic a process as Lakoff and associates claim, we would expect to find a great deal of metaphoric transfer across scripts that are related. Indeed, this is the case. Rememher the many metaphors that teachers used in talking about teaching and learning mentioned in the previous chapter. We can group together creative-enterprise scripts such as weaving, painting, writing, and teaching and metaphorically transfer terms from one script to another with ease. Or we can group together various treatment-ofproblems scripts such as medicine, engineering, teaching, and theology and transfer terms of cures, treatment, and reawakening across them all. Thus, metaphor can be incorporated into script theory.

The nature of semantic networks are being specified in greater and greater detail as computer scientists attempt not only to model scripts but all the relations that exist between words. The hope is that an on-line dictionary might be added to script modcls - an online dictionary that gives information on such relations as types of synonyms, antonyms, converses, part-whole correspondences.

In our discussion of scripts, we said that ISA is a link that joins exemplars to concepts. However, the nature of the ISA link would have to be more specific once the model is enlarged and a relational dictionary is added. For example, when an ISA relation is called up, the relation might be IS A KIND OF ("An oak is a tree"), the generic or hyponym relation. The ISA might be IS THE SAME AS (\*intelligent is smart"), the synonym relation. It might be an attribute, IS AN ATTRIBUTE ("a rock is bard"), or IS MADE OF (\*a lens is made of glass'), the typical adjective or quality and labor relations. While all of these are considered ISA relations, they obviously differ in terms of type of relation. In our discussion of scripts, the part-whole relation was labeled as the HASA relation where props are part of a role (judge HASA gavel) or where parts of an object are named (body HASA parts, arm ISA part). Many semantic networks use HASPART or PART-OF for this second type of relation.

There are many different relational models, all of which identify the

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

lexical relations (but disagree on the number of relations) needed to make it possible for a computer to \*parse" and understand scripts (see Chapter 4). Some of these models have been proposed by lexicographers working with cognitive scientists in an attempt to computerize natural language processing systems.

So far, we have demonstrated that script theory allows us to bring together the many seemingly separate notions we have described in this section on semantics. Relating semantics to scripts solves some of the problems that semantic feature analysis alone cannot solve. We can show, for example, that the problem of plus vs. minus dichotomies are better presented as scales. The choice of an item on the scale relates to the particular script selected and to evaluation within the script (and of role motives and register differences that go with the particular scripr instance). As relational models are added to scripts, we will have an even more powerful way of bringing together much of the information about semantics described in previous chapters.

# Practice 7.2

1. Baldinger (1980) lists the following change of possession terms: give, steal, accept, deliver, lend. What other terms can you think ot? How do scripts intluence the choice ot lexical item?   
2. Each of Baldinger's terms in item 1 has many meanings, some ot which do not signal a change of possession. Look at the following list of expressions and determine whether or not a change of possession is signaled by the verb give: "give him a book," "give him fits," "give him your hand," "give him a gold medal," "give him a cold," "give him a test," "give him a beer." Do you think that the change-ofpossession meaning is the prototype meaning for give?   
3. Verbs of motion like chase, follow, and pursue are also tied to scripts. If a police officer chases a suspect, the meanings of these verbs differ from their use in a classroom script. Think of a variety of scripts that might use these terms. The choices of mental transfer (MTRANS) terms (tell, ask, warn, explain, answer, show) also differ across scripts. In what ways are the meanings of the terms the same or different depending on the script? Give examples to support your answer.   
4. Some of the choices for the PTRANS concept are take, move, bring, put, send, and remove. List as many other terms as you can. Find parallels for these terms in another

language. What similarities and differences do you tind in how these terms show the physical transfer concept?

5. In the \*rip off" example for car repair, Zernik hypothesized that a learner would compare the uses of rip off and cheat across service-encounter scripts. In which service encounters would you be more likely to use cheat than rip off? is the choice a matter of the type of service-encounter script? Or is it a matter of intensity of evaluation? what would be the result if the learner generalized rip off as a synonym for cheat across all service encounter scripts?

6. The connection between scripts and lexical items is sometimes so strong as to be dangerous. Osgood (1978) writes, \*A man can freeze to death for lack of kindling wood and yet be tound with a pocketful of wooden pencils - because pencils are coded to write with, not to make tires with." In creativity workshops, participants are encouraged to think outside scripts. One exercise to encourage creative thought is, "Given a common item, how many things can you think of to do with it?" Select an item and list as many uses as you can. Can you arrange the uses in terms of a hierarchy of scripts? Is your hierarchy based on the frequency or the importance of the item for each script?   
7. In neurolinguistics, there is a set of symptoms that are sometimes called thought disorder. Patients exhibit what might be called nonscript-bound use of lexicon. Prototypic words for a script are called up, but the organizing framework of the script quickly disappears and the person continues talking with vocabulary \*"activated' by a lexicon associated not with the script but with individual vocabuIary items. The result sounds similar to that of stream-ofconsciousness writing or certain types of poetry:   
a. My mother's name was Bill and coo. St. Valentine's Day was the start of the breedin' season of the birds.   
b. Looks like clay. Sounds like gray. Take you for a rol in the hay. Hay day. May day. Help! I just can't. Need help. May day.   
c. I had a little goldfish iike a clown. Happy Hallowe'en down.

(Data source: Chaika, 1985)

Think about what this might mean in terms of theory. In the introduction, we cited J. Yamada's research to show that conceptual and linguistic systems are separate systems. How could we use the Chaika data to claim that script sys

Vocabulary, semantics, and language education tems and semantic systens are separate as well? Or could we claim that language is an integrated cognitivesocial-linguistic systen, but that at places in that system, processes may be short-circuited, producing what only appear to be separate systems? (If you can articulate this well, please let us know your answer!)

# Script semantics, language teaching, and testing

There are many areas of script analysis that have direct counterparts in language teaching. For example, consider the teaching of languages for specific purposes. Students training in hotel or restaurant management have specific purposes in mind for studying languages. If they hope to attract tourists from Japan or if they hope to create a Japanese ambience in a Japanese-style restaurant in another country, then it is important to know the Japanese script for hotels or for restaurants. The language for the variety of scripts within this profession are limited so the language instruction can be directed toward those specific scripts.

Special courses for nurses, doctors, and other medical personnel also highlight script learning and the vocabulary necessary for medical purposes. The acquisition of vocabulary in medicine can also be related to script theory. It is not uncommon in some countrics for shopkeepers to have mastered their particular special purpose scripts in many different Ianguages. They need to be able to do the script in English at one moment, and be ready to replay it in French, German, Italian, Spanish, or Arabic the next. You might believe that this learning has little scope, but if you think of the range of service encounters, you realize that the language needed for these scripis can be generalized and refined across many different situations. The vocabulary needed in contract negotiation is transferable to many different scripts.

If you think of most survival courses in languages for new immigrants and travelers, you will see that they are organized around scripts (e.g., going to the market, going to the doctor, getting a driver's license, using public transportation). Although these courses are not usually considered specific purpose instruction, they relate to script theory. The vocabulary taught in each unit is script-bound to a large extent.

Finally, in language assessment, the vocabulary of domains is often tested. This domain includes all the vocabulary that is used by persons playing specific roles and using specific props in the home situation, for example. The vocabulary of this domain could be subdivided into that of semantic fields (i.e., kinship terms, eating utensils, cooking terms, furniture terms, clothing and personal adornment terms, names of toys, and so forth). The vocabulary of the school domain would include that of actors, props, and actions of the school script (i.e., role terms like student, principal, teacher, security guard; prop terms like books, pencils, chalkboards, basketball hoops; and the action terms discussed earlier in this chapter). The language and the vocabulary of domains is very much script-bound.

# Practice 7.3

1. Prepare a list of vocabulary words that you believe a 7-year-old child shou!d know for the home domain. Check your items against the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test English, French, or Spanish versions. Did you list all the key words included in this test? What scripts from the home domain are reflected in the test items? Select the items that seem most important to you and administer the test to both monolingual and bilingual children. Are the bilingual children able to give you the vocabulary in each Ianguage? How would you explain your findings? what strengths and weaknesses do you see in the test and your own items in terms of testing the general vocabulary of young children? In how many domains and how many scripts must one be able to operate before one can be judged "bilingual"?   
2. Prepare a list ot schooi terms that a bilingual child would need to know by the end of the first year of instruction. Administer this test to both monolingual and bilingual students. Can the bilingual children give you terms for these items in both languages? How would you explain your findings?   
3. In elementary schools, the curriculum often includes mandated units. California missions, space and space exploration, and computers are three units in a tourth-grade classroom we observed. Consider the importance of the vocabulary in each of these units for the bilingual child. What words might be included in a test of fourth-grade academic vocabulary?   
4. Survival courses are meant to prepare adults for everyday interactions in their new language in a variety of scripts. After this tirst level is completed, what other script areas listed in this section might one select next (and what types of vocabulary would need to be learned)?   
5. If you have taken a specific purpose or survival course in another language, what types of scripts and vocabulary did you hope to learn? How did you go about dealing with the

inadequacies in the number or types of scripts and vocabulary given in the class?

6. There are a number of theories about the best ways to promote intant bilingualism. One of these is the "one language-one person" principal where one person, parent or caretaker consistently uses one language while the other consistently uses a second language. This has been extended to a "one language-one environment" principle where one language is used consistently at home and the other at school. Another model in bilingual education is the alternate days' use (on Monday, it's Spanish; on Tuesday it's English). How do these principles relate to script learning and to the acquisition of language by domains?

# Thematic and conceptual structure theory

Because linguists are primarily interested in the acquisition of the syntactic system of language, it is not surprising that most linguists criticize script theory as lacking information about how the meanings in scripts are related to syntactic structure. For them, script knowledge is just part of "world knowledge" and, as such, has little relation to linguistic theory.

Even at the sentence level, however, linguistic theory must include some characterization of semantic meaning, and it is this level of representation that is of interest to linguists. Fillmore, Chomsky, Gruber, and Jackendoff, among other linguists, consider roles important in clarifying the relationship between semantics and syntax. The roles, however, are not tied to scripts but to sentences, and the relation differs significantly in these writings. A brief summary is offered below. (More technical arguments about the relation of semantics and syntax can be found in the writings of each of these theorists.) Following this short summary, we will turn to Jackendoff's proposal that semantics be included within a more general conceptual structure. We will attempt to show how his conceptual structure hypothesis relates to conceptual dependency theory.

If you think about the roles that persons or objects play in sentences rather than scripts, you can see that parts of meanings can be derived from those roles. Fillmore (1977) identified a number of roles important for semantic-syntactic relationships. We will only touch on his classification of roles here (see Part II for a detailed discussion). If a person intentionally and willfully carries out an action shown in a verb, thc person has a special role of agent of the action. In English, agents commonly occur in subject position. However, if the person or object is acted upon, the role is less active in meaning. This role is called patient. The patient is typically a direct object. If the action is carried out using another object, that object has an instrumental role. Roles typically occupy certain positions in sentences. Thus, in the sentence \*John cut the wood with a band saw," John has an agent role and is in subject position; wood has a patient role and is in object position; band suw has an instrumental role and is a prepositional phrase. The recipient role is that typically assigned to indirect objects (e.g., \*Miss Rodriguez [agent] taughr Bob [recipient] Spanish (patient]"). The relation between these theme roles and syntactic position, however, is not strictly predictable. In the sentence "The band saw cut the wood," band saw is still in an instrumental role but it now serves as subject of the sentence. In the sentence "The wood was cut by John," the patient and agent have been switched so that the patient is in subject position and the agent in object position. The order of recipient and patient can also be changed: "Miss Rodriguez taught Spanish to Bob."

Such case or theme roles also appear in Chomsky's theory of government and binding where they are called "theta roles." In Chomsky's 1981 Lectures on Government and Binding, he notes, "It has traditionally been assumed that such notions as 'agent-of-action,' 'goal-of-action,' etc. play an important role in semantic description" (p. 35). He proposes thar theta roles can be assigned a "theta-position" in syntax. Because Chomsky did not completely specify theta roles, the MIT Lexicon Project (Levin, 1985) set as its goal the defining of the inventory of theta roles (how many roles are needed and how are they best characterized) and criteria for determining how these roles relate to the functions of verbs and nouns within sentences. The MIT Lexicon Project's position is that there is a direct correlation between thematic structure and semantic classes and syntax.

Jackendoff's work (1985), however, differs in that he claims that there is a correlation between thematic roles and meaning but not necessarily hetween theme roles and syntax. Instead of limiting his description to theme roles, he proposed a conceptual structure hypothesis. Conceptual structure does not contain script information but it does contain information that comes from perception (visual and sensory information) and motor information. Conccptual structure must, then, give some description of the concepts described as MOVE or PTRANS in script theory since thcy involve motor information. A description must be given of the concept MTRANS since this involves perceptual information, and of EVAL since evaluation relates in some sense to sensory feedback. 1n Jackendoff's work, this description would be part of conceptual strueture, a separate level of description which brings together perceptual (visual, sensory, etc.) information, information from the motor system, and pragmatic information, as well. Thus, in Jackendoff's theory, semantic structure is part of conceptual structure. It is relevant to, but independent from, strictly linguistic phenomena.

As an example, Jackendoff's proposed description (as presented by

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

Wilkins, 1994, p. 123) for the verb $p u t$ includes syntactic information that it is a verb and that it is preceded by a subject noun phrase and followed by an object noun phrases and a prepositional phrase.

PUT   
$[ - N , + V ]$   
NP. NP,PPk

This is followed by the conceptual structure, which here consists of two tiers. A thematic tier shows that put is an event where a thing goes from one location along a path to another location:

$$
\biggl [ \mathrm  \small ~ \tt ~ / F R O M ~ / [ \mit _ { P L A C E } ] \mit _ { i } \} \biggr ] \} \biggr ] ,
$$

An action tier shows that the act of putting involves causality where one entity acts in a volitional, causal manner on another:

$$
C A U S E \  ( \mathrm { I _ { T H I N G } \{ \} } \mathrm { J _ { 1 } } , \mathrm { I _ { E V E N T } } A C T \ ( \mathrm { I _ { T H I N G } } \mathrm { J ^ { \mathrm { \tiny { 8 } } } } , \mathrm { [ \mathrm { \mathrm { _ { T H I N G } } ] ^ { \mathrm { \tiny { \alpha } } } } } \mathrm { J } ) ] \} \mathrm { I }
$$

The thematic tier in this theory is related to perception (and involves thematic roles such as location, source, etc). The action tier is related to a theory of events and involves such roles as agent, patient, and so forth. Thus, the conceptual structure hypothesis contains within it the notions introduced earlier by Fillmore (1977) and adopted as theta roles by Chomsky (1981). In this hypothesis, however, these roles do not directly determine syntactic structures. The link between the semantics of conceptual structure and syntax is accomplished by a system of subscripts.

The subscripts in Jackendoff's formal notions are used to tie the description together. The identify of i, j, and $k$ are the same at each level of the description. So in the syntactic description, the subscript i would identify the subject Susie in the sentence "Susie put the baby in the chair." In the thematic tier, i is the source at which the movement begins (i.e., the baby noves from Susie to the chair). In the final action tier, the subscript i shows that Susie is the agent that carries out the act that causes the movement of the baby to the chair.

The MOVE concept in script theory is described more completely in Jackendoff's theory (as presented by Wilkins). For example, the conceptual structure thematic tier for ENTER as a verb of motion is described as:

$$
\begin{array} { r l } { \mathrm { ) } \ ( | \propto ] , } & { \left[ \begin{array} { c } { \mathrm { F R O M } \ \backslash \ ( | _ { \mathrm { P L A C E } } | 3 ] ) } \\ { \mathrm { P A T H } \ \mathrm { T O } \ ( [ _ { \mathrm { P I A C E } } \ \mathrm { I N } \ ( [ \gamma ] ) ] ) } \end{array} \right] \mathrm { ) } } \end{array}
$$

This concept structure shows that something goes from someplace along a path to another place. Notice, though, that the sentence "Susie entered (\*from the hall) (\*into) the office' is not acceptable in English. The English verb enter has included the PATH and PLACE functions within it and only expresses the final location. The Spanish sentence Susana entro en la oficina is acceptable. Wilkins (1994) explains that Spanish does not include the PATH and PLACE function in the verb and so these must be supplied syntactically. According to Jackendoff (and most linguists), the same conceptual structure is shared by the two languages, but the lexicalization of the concept differs and this information is reflected in sentence syntax.

As you can see, Jackendoff's conceptual structure descriptions are much more complete than the concept labels of scripts. To show this, we have contrasted his more detailed description of one type of PTRANS, the concept PUT, and one MOVE concept, ENTER. With separate tiers of description for conceptual structure (theme and action and a temporal tier not presented here) and tying the conceptual tiers to syntactic information, Jackendoff's description also aliows us to pinpoint the contrasts in lexicalization of conceptual structures across languages.

# Practice 7.4

1. Nilsen and Nilsen (1975, p. 111) list four classes of motion verbs: transportation (e.g., walk), transter (e.g., throw), exchange (e.g., reimburse), and communication (e.g., exp/ain). Add one more example for each class. Explain how Schank's conceptual dependency theory and Jackendoff's conceptual structure hypothesis differ in the way they would include such verbs in their respective theories.   
2. Talmy (1980) shows that there is a difference in the ways that Spanish and English lexicalize the path part of the concept SwIM. Can the following sentences mean both that the swimming took place under the watertall and that a path was crossed from one side ot the waterfall to the Other? Ben swam under the waterfatl.   
Benjamin nadaba debajo de la cascada.

Which theory, conceptual dependency theory or conceptual structure theory, best accounts for this difference? Select two other languages and determine whether both readings are possible for the words for SwIM. 3. Shirai (1990a) notes that it is perfectly acceptable in Japanese to say the equivalent of "I put the book" or \*He finished talking and put the receiver." Jackendoff's conceptual structure for the concept PUT is the same for both languages. What part of the conceptual structure is lexicalized in a different way in the two languages? (Recall

Wilkins's explanation of lexicalization of ENTER in Spanish and English.)

4. American Sign Language often includes location in verb signs. Using a sign tor move, for example, it is possible to show the starting point and the ending point. To show that I will give you a book, the sign might start at the location of the book and move toward you. If you know or are studying ASL or another sign language, explain how location is lexicalized in such signs as LOOK AT, BRING, and other signs of your choice. Think of the ways that size, shape, manner, and intensity are lexicalized into verbs such as RUN, EAT or other signs. Would Jackendoff's conceptual structure hypothesis be useful in analyzing American Sign Language?

5. Eachrof the following verbs marks a change ot state that occurs only if an instrument can be used. If you were writing a conceptual structure description, how might you characterize the CAUSE of the change in state for these verbs? Explain how parts of the description might be 'subscripted' to show this. You don't need to write a formal description, though you may if you wish.

Verbs of change of state (instrument) dampen, douse, dye, electrify, flood, freeze, season, shock, spice up, turn off-on, wash, wet down

6. Some verbs that relate to a change of state reflect an internal change, whereas others are caused by another person (agent). Identify which of the following states wouid require a separate agent in the description. In some of the examples, does something else need to be specified (i.e., do all the verbs seem to relate to the change of state in the same way)?

State or change of state: "Be/become X"   
educated (teach, learn)   
dead (die, killi)   
aware (remind, remember)   
risen (raise, rise)   
forgiven (apologize, forgive)   
knowing (see, show)   
set (sit, set)

Select another language and check to see whether similar pairs of verbs relate to the change of state.

7. In collections of humorous quotes, we may label the humor as coming from oxymorons, strange conversives, or other misplaced relations. It is also possible to view the errors as examples of mistakes in conceptual lexicalization. For example, "I collided with a stationary truck coming the other way' is wrong because the verb come has a conceptual structure tor movement which is impossible for a stationary truck. What errors of lexicalization can you discover in the following quotes said to have appeared on insurance claims?

My car was legally parked as t backed into the other vehicle. An invisible car came out of nowhere, struck my vehicle, and vanished.   
A pedestrian hit me and went under my car.   
The telephone pole was approaching fast. I was attempting to swerve out of its path when it struck my front end.   
A stop sign suddenly appeared in a place where no stop sign had ever appeared before. I was unable to stop in time to avoid the accident.

# Summary of Part I

The goals of cognitive psychologists and linguists are not always the same and their descriptions of the semantic system differ. Linguists need a semantic description that will fit into their overall conception of language. Componential analysis fit into the theory current at the time it was first proposed. Semantic features and phonological features met the same perceived need to break units down into still smaller components, which were meaningful for transformational descriptions of Ianguage. Psychologists have been more interested in the relation of perception and language and so their descriptions include features that have a less central impact on the grammar system of the language. Still, core vs. periphery and prototype analyses are important in both psychology and linguistics since core or prototype exemplars are more basic and should, therefore, be easy to learn. Our perceptual system also seems linked to our use of everyday conceptual metaphor, and for some cognitive psychologists this is a crucial area of research on semantics. In conceptual dependency theory, Schank and his associates have attempted to link the structure of everyday events (scripts) and the concepts activated with the scripts. Computer scientists, however, cannot build natural language processing systems that are large enough to handle all the possible scripts of real life without figuring out how to build larger and more detailed lexicons. Lexicographers working with relational models of semantic networks hope to build such models. Linguists like Jackendoff, however, attempt

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

to link cognitive concepts and the ways the words that lexicalize these concepts are used to create sentences. Applied linguists find all of these approaches to semantics of interest. However, the theories - whether natural semantic metalanguage, conceptual dependency theory, relational models, semantic feature analysis, prototype analysis, or analysis of metaphor - must apply across linguistic systems. Therefore, much of their research has examined the value of each analysis across language systems and the potential of each analysis in explaining variability in second language learning.

Not surprisingly, linguists criticize cognitive psychologists for ignoring syntax and cognitive psychologists criticize linguists for ignoring any structured language beyond the sentence. Lexicographers criticize both linguists and psychologists to the extent that each ignores the centrality of the lexicon in language theory. Each has limited the scope of description because the phenomena to be described are so complex and the description is so difficult. There is no reason, however, that the strengths of all of these approaches might not one day be joined into a coherent theory of language. Since our presentation of the methods of semantic analysis in Part I has also simplified these approaches, we encourage you to read the major writings of each approach to understand better how cognitive and linguistic descriptions relate to the study of meaning.

# Research and application

# Semantic relations in cognitive models

1. Collins and Quillian (1972) developed a network model of semantic relations that has been popular in cognitive science. They used reaction times as a measure of connectedness: if the pause before response was short, it was assumed that the information was in the network. If the pause before response was longer, Collins and Quillian assumed the information was not in the network and had to be constructed or inferred. Their relations include:

a. superset-superordinate

b. subsets

freguently used and less used supersets exist (e.g., a bear is a kind of animal)   
most important, easiest strategy (e.g., trees include oaks, pines, and maples, among others)   
properties of one concept applied to another via inference, providing a basis for distingnishing (e.g., a lamb is hike a sheep only smaller) or grouping (e.g., a tri

c. similarity d. part

e. proximity-adjacency

cycle is like a bicycle because they both have wheels)   
especially useful for geography, anatomy, and architecture   
especially useful for geography and anatomy   
especially useful for history and science   
f. consequence (causality) and precedence   
g. parent

# for kinship

Since Collins and Quillian identify certain relations as being especially important for a particular field of study, you might use this system as background for developing lessons that stress particular lexical or semantic relations between words. Which relations would you select? How does the choice differ from that you identified in Chapter 4 on relational models? 2. Rumelhart, Lindsay, and Norman (1972) developed "maps" as visual displays of how "pathways' between words are represented. The network that is revealed is a pictorial network. Look at the diagrams and maps they develop and decide whether you might be able to use one or both in teaching particular types of semantic relations. If you believe they would be useful, develop a short presentation using the method and evaluate its effectiveness. Share your findings with other teachers at a staff meeting or conference.

# Scripts

3. Nilsen and Nilsen (1975, p. 111) give lists of lexical items for four classes of verbs of motion. How might you differentiate among these via scripts?   
4. Bermudez and Prater (1990) used brainstorming (where children call out words they associate with a particular topic) and clustering (where they then group the words into categories) techniques with limited English proficient writers to develop elaboration. The teacher acted as scribe, writing words and phrases suggested by 16 third- and fourth-grade bilingual children on a topic. The words were written on a transparency and shown on an overhead projector. Concepts that were related were circled on the transparency. Two days later, the children wrote about the same topic. The children in this group that used brainstorming and clustering wrote more elaborate compositions than children in the group that did not. How would you explain the results of this study with script theory? Since the children could activate

the vocabulary associated with the script and could group the words into concept areas, why would these techniques be needed to improve their writing about the script topic? Design a research project that would test the effectiveness of brainstorming and clustering techriques with adult students. Would you predict the same results (more elaborate writing)? What areas of writing other than elaborateness might be related to this technique?

5. Many studies have shown the comparative strengths and weaknesses in vocabulary for bilingnal children by domain. Bilingual children may know the vocabulary of the home (names for furniture, dinnerware, clothing, food) or of school (recess, playground, teacher, math, social studies) in one language but not the other. These differences may not be evident in a general vocabulary test but might be detected if children are tested by domain (see Fishman et al., 197l). Legaretta (1979) also developed a series of tests that elicited vocabulary by domains as part of a larger evaluation of types of bilingnal programs. Locate as many instruments as you can that test vocabulary by domain. After you have critiqued the available tests and test nethods, devise and try out a pilot procedure of your own.

6. Review the survey of word association tests in Albert and Obler (1978, pp. 47-58). The results of these tests are related to the notion of compound vs. coordinate bihngualism or of balanced bilingualism, language dominant bilingual, or second language learning. How might script senantics across domains relate to the findings?

7. Demers and Farner (1986, p. 177) give lists of words with emotive meaning. We have suggested the selection of items on the scales might be related to script roles in particular settings. Here are some of the scales: places: tavern-bar-dive, women: fairer sex-female-broad, automobiles: car-jalopy-heap, relationships: separate from-walk out on-desert, talk: uninteresting-nonsense-- baloney. How would you answer a student's question as to when you use each choice on the scale? Prepare a research plan to test whether your students or native speakers of the langnage make a consistent choice when multiple-choice test items illustrate different scripts.

8. Erickson and Mattson (198l) and van Oostendorf and de Mul (1990) show that adults answer questions such as "How many animals of each kind did Moses take on the ark?" without noticing the Moses-Noah error. They attribute this to the semantic similarity of Moses and Noah. Both are male biblical characters; they are both leaders, involved with water, and so forth. How might

this finding relate to script theory and spreading activation across scripts? Do you think that second language learners experience more or fewer such semantic oversights? How might you go about testing your answer?

9. Brinton and Gaskill (1978) used edited videotapes of news broadcasts in teaching EFL in Germany and ESL to adults in Los Angeles. The article describes the procedures used in each environment (e.g., vocabulary glosses, prelistening and guided listening activities, follow-up activities). They list the benefits of broadcasts in the classroom:

a. They are timely and relevant.   
b. The recycling of vocabulary is more consistent, in particular in news items which reappear over a period of several weeks.   
c. News items provide the student with a more useful core vocabulary, which enables the student to more readily participate in the type of conversations he or she is likely to encounter in a social situation.   
d. The cultural asides gleaned from news broadcasts provide the student with a broader knowledge of the target culture.

Tape a newcast about one topic from National Public Radio news over several days. Is there a script for the news reports? Select key vocabulary for two of the news items and prepare a gloss for each. What prehistening and guided listening activities would you use? What follow-up activities? Ask students to rate the usefulness of the newscast lesson in terms of the four benefits listed by Brinton and Gaskill.

Sentence-based hypotheses (case, theme, conceptual structure)

10. Miller et al. (l990) describe the types of relations in WordNet, an on-line lexical database, including I\$A relations, which are called hyponyms in WordNet. Miller says that the hyponym inherits the features of the more generic concept and adds at least one feature that distinguishes it from its superordinate term. What feature would distinguish July in JULY ISA MONTH? WordNet also includes HASA relations, which are called meronymy in the WordNet system. This relation is symmetric as in A HASA $\pmb { \chi }$ (the book HASA page) and X ISA PART OF A (a page ISA part of a book). The system also includes synonymy where one item can be substituted for another witliout changing the truth value of the sentence. Similarity judgments may also be given of the type that X IS SIMILAR TO $\pmb { \gamma }$ means that Y IS EQUALLY SIMILAR TO $\pmb { \chi }$ ("New

York is similar to Chicago'; "Chicago is similar to New York"). Read this introduction to WordNet and consider how an on-line lexical database of this sort might be linked to script theory.

11. The Oxford Advanced Learners' Dictionary (Hornby 1989) uses semantic headings for polysemous verbs that relect those of case grammar descriptions. The most common verbs in English are those that have the most meanings (have, be, run, make, go, take, set). The meanings are separated by headings such as performing an action, receiving or undergoing action, producing, caus. ing or aliowing something to happen. Check other dictionaries to see if they use case descriptions to separate the meanings of common verbs. What other case headings might you add if you were designing a dictionary that used a conceptual basis?

12. Fillmore (l971) analyzes many different lexicalizations of the concept JUDCE, including accuse, blame, criticize, credit, praise, scold, confess, apologize, forgive, justify, and excuse. Read this article and integrate Fillmore's analysis with a script approach. Which verbs go with what roles in which scripts? Alternatively, look for instances of these verbs in the classroom script and see how they relate to teacher, student, and principal roles.

13. Miller (l972) describes the outcome of card-sorting tasks for a group of verbs of motion including go, stride, walk, stroll, tiptoe, sprint, and jog. The analysis revealed that the verbs were categorized along two dimensions: speed (slow to fast) and foot orientation (heel to toe). Prepare a research plan to investigate as many verbs of motion as you can. You might try several options: a contextual analysis based on a computer search for the forms in data such as the Brown corpus, a variety of displays (semantic field boxes, tree diagrams, relational model descriptions), and a script analysis. You could carry out the project in a language other than English or as a cross-linguistic comparison of terms from two languages.

# : Adding to the lexicon

There are many ways in which the lexicon of a language can be enlarged. We will discuss four in this chapter: borrowing words from other languages; creating new words (coinage); using the names of people or places to refer to a related object; making shifts and conversions where meanings of words or their parts of speech change. In Chapter 9 we will look at additive and subtractive processes used to create new terms for meanings.

# Borrowing

All languages borrow words from other languages. English borrowed an extremely large number of lexical items from French during the occupation period which followed the Norman Conquest in 1066. Legal occupation meant that terms for the court, law, and property would enter English from French. And so, while English terms like king and queen survived, French provided the new words sovereign, crown, state, and government. Thief and steal are English terms but burglar comes from French, along with such law terms as accuse, plea, fee, and attorney general. Because the French took military control, we find enemy, danger, soldier, and guard added to the lexicon. The influcncc of the church brought new terms, too, like religion, service, virgin, and trinity. And, of course, the language of food also changed. As has often been noted, Sir Walter Scott in Ivanhoe popularized the saying that while the names of many animals in their lifetime are English (e.g., cow, calf, sheep, swine, deer), they appear on the table as French (e.g., beef, veal, mutton, pork, bacon, venison).

All cultures that have contact are likely to borrow vocabulary from each other. English has words borrowed from almost every language of the wor!d. Immigrants from many parts of the world have brought their Ianguages to enrich our own. Many words in U.S. English have a Spanish origin, which should not be surprising since Spanish has been an important language of the Southwest for long periods of our history. In other parts of the world, borrowing also occurs primarily between neighboring languages (as in the heavy borrowing from Arabic in many Afro-Asiatic Ianguages). Or at a particular time in history, a language may borrow mainly from one language (as in the Japanese borrowing of English words in the past 40 years).

Borrowing is a sociolinguistic process which is not always appreciated by all members of the language community. In countries that have a language academy, there is usualiy an attempt to keep the language "pure" by prohibiting borrowed words. For example, France, by law, has tried to prevent the use of English words in French. AGULF, an acronym for the society of users of the French language, successfully sued TWA, the Paris Opera, and I.e Monde for using English words to sell or promote products. Nevertheless, things such as le parking du building are heard frequently, and a quick perusal of French popular magazines shows that even law cannot stop the process.

Borrowed words may be marked as such by keeping the original pronunciation and spelling of the word. However, if the word is used for any length of time, changes begin to occur and the pronunciation and spelling become closer and closer to the borrowing language. For example, in U.S. cafeterias that serve a variety of food from other countries, students order Mexican breakfasts pronouncing desayuno de carne, tacodillas, or huevos rancheros in a decidedly English-sounding fashion.

Some languages have affixes which help to nativize borrowed words. For example, Japanese uses suru (a marker similar to our do auxiliary) for borrowed words such as memorize suru and touch suru. When English adjectives are used, a na marker may be used, as in intellectual na benkyoo, or cool na nominomo. German often uses -i(e)ren so that English ruin becomes ruiniren, publish becomes publiziren, and Italian capre becomes kapieren. Russian uses -ovat so that publish would become publikovat and figure would be figurirovat.

Frequently, borrowed words are used for only a specific meaning. For exampie, the word pink might be borrowed although the language already has a word for pink. The English word might be used only for a lipstick color, whereas the native language word would be used for all other items. Hotel might be borrowed and used for Western-type hotels, and the native language word would be used for those not Western. In Japanese, for example, the word reguest has been borrowed and nativized as rikuesuto, but it is only used as a request for a band to play a certain song. The word mansion has been borrowed and nativized as manshyon to refer at first only to high-rise condos but now can be used even for a one-room apartment. In the Nepali language (Acharya, 1990), the English word impression is used but only for printing; the word cabinet is borrowed but only used to refer to the government. A calendar is only the kind hung on the watl. Paper is used only for newspapers and fire is only used in the sense of firing bullets.

The meanings of borrowed words may also be extended to other new meanings which do not obtain in the source language. For example.

Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

Stanlaw (1982) writes that the words wet and dry both appear as loans in Japanese. But wetto has been extended to include the meaning of sentimental or soft-hearted, and dorai can mean businesslike.

Borrowed words can become an unintended source of humor. For example, Agua Dulce ("sweet water" in Spanish) is the name of a city in California where building is now prohibited due to contaminated ground water. Bolaq, a district in Cairo, is an adaptation of beau lac, though there is no lake to be seen. Similarly, Lake L.os Angeles, located in the desert, has only a dry lake bed. (The Chamber of Commerce hopes to persuade voters to change the name to stem the deluge of calls from fishermen, boat owners, and swimmers looking for a new vacation spot.)

Restaurants often use French words to create effect, but novelists also use borrowed words to create ambiance. Herbert, in his Dune series, borrows heavily from Arabic. The Clockwork Orange is famous for its use of borrowed lexical items from Russian. In each case, a special time. warp or sinister effect is achieved.

A distinction needs to be made here between lexical borrowing and language mixing. In borrowing, the words become part of language and are used by the speakers of that language as though they were native lexical items. We all use terms like garage (French), confetti (Italian), vodka (Russian), goulasb (Hungarian), and robot (Czech) without much thought of their origin. There are, of course, stages in assimilation of borrowed words. They may be markcd with special affixes; the pronunciation of the words may gradually shift until they fit that of the native language. The end result is that the words are treated as ordinary words of the language.

In language mixing and switching, the words are momentarily borrowed by individual speakers in order to create certain effects. The novelists mentioned earlier borrowed words from other languages into English in a manner that made them appear to be part of that language within the world of the novel. This is quite different, say, from Peter's (1983) delightful Amelia Peabody, a heroine who switches from English to Arabic with ease, thereby adding to our appreciation of Peabody's many intellectual accomplishments.

The dividing line between borrowing and mixing is fuzzy to say the least. We usually think of borrowing as a long-term process within the language of a social group and mixing as a momentary individual phenomenon. However, within bilingual communities the distinction is less clear. Members of such communities may use either the L1 or L2 when speaking with monolinguals. In their own social communication, however, they may use the L1 with heavy borrowing from the L2. Although it is almost always possible to determine which language is basic, the amount of mixing is great. Some linguists claim that the mixed language spoken by the bilingual social community is a separate L3.

# Practice 8.1

1. We mentioned a number ot ways that languages "nativize" loan words (such as adding -ovat to make the borrowed word more Russian). In the languages you know, what sorts of markers are used?

2. Borrowing words becomes more complicated when words are borrowed into a language that marks gender. One solution is to assign all borrowed words arbitrarily to one gender. Sometimes, however, the borrowed word is given the same gender as the closest corresponding word in that language. For example, nere are some English words used in Texas Spanish (Tex Mex): una bike (una bicicleta), el dress (el vestido), al shopping center (al centrc). Does Jos egg whites fit this pattern? If you know a language that marks gender, see how it solves the problem of assigning gender to borrowed terms.

3. As borrowed words become nativized, the pronunciation has a better fit to that of the native language. Look at the following list of borrowed words in Japanese. Say the word aloud several times so that you can identify the English source word. There may be cases where you can supply the English words but are not sure of the meaning. Check these with a native speaker of Japanese.

mega hon bakku miraa enjin kit gaado man makaroni uesutan doraibu mappu neku tai tabako maikuro basu famiriisaizu poppu koon shoppingu sentaa jogingu saundo torakku beebi buumu depaato iji oodaa sukin shippu

(Source: Morimoto, 1983)

Acharya (1990) gives examples from Nepali where vote becomes bhoT, plate becomes pilet, and orderly becomes ordali. What do these Japanese and Nepali examples tell you about the differences in phonology in the languages? 4. Crane et ai. (1981, p. 45) list words borrowed trom French into English. They also note that borrowing results in synonyms of the original English term and the borrowed French term, such as help-aid, hide-conceal. Select ten words and check their synonyms in a dictionary of synonyms. Trace the etymology of the synonyms in an etymological dictionary. How many of the synonyms can be accounted for in terms of borrowing?

Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

5. American Sign Language borrows words from English. Ordinary fingerspelling is not considered borrowing, but when fingerspelled words take on other attributes of signs (place, movement, and palm orientation) they take on the phonology of ASL and become integrated into the sign system. The fingerspelled word A-L-L is now used with different movements, and can mean YOU-ALL, ALL-OFTHESE-THINGS, ALL-OF-US, ALL-OF-THEM (small group close), ALL-OF-THEM (large group far away). ALWAYS-SO-FAR, EVERYTHING-LISTED, and others. The fingerspelled D-O can be made with different movements and orientations to mean \*What am t supposed to do?" "What are you doing?" or "I've been doing lots of busywork." If you know ASL, give additional examples of the ways in which words borrowed from English are made to tit the sign system.

6. For many years, languages borrowed technical and scientific words from either Latin or German. Now, much technicai vocabulary is taken from English. List examples of technical vocabulary that have been borrowed into another Ianguage you know. Have the words been changed in any way to make them fit the language? How important is standardization of terms in scientitic writing?

7. We have noted that Japanese has borrowed many English words and nativized the forms to fit Japanese phonology. It you teach (or are learning) Japanese as a foreign language, how usefu! are these borrowings in language learning? Should these borrowings be made explicit for learners? Conversely, some languages have contributed only a few items to English. If you teach in a muiticultural school, would you highlight these borrowings as a way of stimulating multicultural awareness? Explain your reasoning.

8. If you are interested in the relation of politics and language, investigate the language policies ot Turkey or Nepal. Turkey is an especially intriguing case with regard to lexical (and structural) borrowing. If you believe the policy has been successfui, how do you account for the borrowing that has occurred? Nepal (Acharya, 1990) is presently embroiled in a controversy as to whether items should be borrowed from Sanskrit or from English. Despite the controversy, lexical items continue to be borrowed from both and from Hindi, Urdu, Persian, and Arabic. This is an important issue as the country moves toward making Nepali the language of instruction, where new terms must be introduced for academic purposes.

# Coinage

Every language has words that have not been borrowed from other languages but that have developed with the language over time. These are called native words. But what happens when a new word is needed, no appropriate borrowed word is available, and there is no native word? There are a number of options, but one obvious one is to coin a new word. Derek Smith, the Louisville basketball player, is credited with creating high-five, a word first used as a celebratory gesture, a slap of right hands by players, high over their heads. Since then, it has become a general celebratory term (e.g., "Market upswing brings high-fives to Wall Street").

In the introduction to this book, we said that words are arbitrary, but we know that is not strictly true. The form of the word must fit the phonology of the language. If we were to discover a new product, we would not name it Sbmeyt or Wnhrat because neither fits the sound patterns of English. Depending on the image we hoped to evoke for the product, we might try for combinations of sounds that somehow seem to exemplify that characteristic. If we wanted to emphasize the endearing qualities of the irem or its small size, we would likely end the word with the letter $y , \ i ,$ or $e \mathrm { ~ - ~ }$ letters used for the /i/ sound. If we wanted to emphasize the sheen of its surface, we might well begin the word with sh-, as in shimmer, shine and so forth. So a new wax product might begin with sh- or $8 l -$ (if we prefer glitter, gleam, glisten). Companies spend a great deal of money trying to find exactly the right sound and letter combination for their particular product. The car name Acura is said to be an example of an excellent choice bacause it sounds as though the engine has the perfect engineering of a Swiss watch. Miyata is supposed to have an appealing ring to it so that, even though it carries no meaning, it would appeal to a worldwide market. The car itself does but it is doubtful if Spanish speakers find its name all that sporty, fun, and appealing. Still, it is said that Mist hairspray sells well in Germany even though mist means filthy in German.

1. How do you think the makers of the product Kleenex arrived at that name? Why do you think the brand name became the word tor facial tissues? Kodak is another example of a brand name that has become a general synonym for camera. List as many other brand names which

have become general terms as you can. Why have they been incorporated into the general lexicon in this way?   
2. Potter (1971) lists many words which were coined by individuals and then became common. Many of these people, however, either based their new words on Latin or other languages. For example, George Bernard Shaw is credited with introducing the word superman (and starting the fashion in super-words) based on his translation of Nietzsche's Ubermensch. Can you think of other examples of individuals who have coined words for the language?   
3. Astroturf was a word created for the grasslike synthetic covering on sports fields. On National Public Radio news, a U.S. senator talked about astroturf as mail from his constituents that did not reflect grass-roots opinion on an issue but rather the efforts of lobbyists who get people to sign torm letters. How quickly do you think that new words are used metaphoricaly? Can you supply additional examples?   
4. Select two recent words and compare their treatment in two dictionaries of new words (e.g., J. Green, Neologisms: New Words Since 1960, S. Tulloch, Oxford Dictionary of New Words, or Ayto, Longman Register of New Words, 1989). Which dictionary would a language teacher find more useful? Justify your choice.

# Names of people and places

The namcs of inventors of products or people associated with particular products have often become the words for the products themselves. Such words are called eponyms. For example, the word maverick came from the major of San Antonio who refused to brand his cattle. Maverick then became a term for unbranded cattle, and later for anyone who took an independent stand.

The word boycott is also based on the name of a real person, Captain Boycott, a retired British army captain who oversaw estates in Ireland and refused to give humanitarian concessions to his Irish tenants. They hated him so much that they ostracized him and boycott became a synonym for rejection and isolation.

Many who use Tupperware plastic containers are unaware that they were named for the inventor, a chemist at DuPont. A favorite eponym is poinsettia -- a Christmas plant named for the ambassador to Mexico who introduced it to the United States. Not only inventors or famous people from long ago have their names used in this way, for new eponyms are formed constantly. For example, in computer talk, a sagan means a large quantity of anything, after the astronomer Car! Sagan's famous "billions and billions" talk. So one might say the United States spends sagans on the military. The eponym gerrymander was recreated in Japanese when Prime Minister Hatoyama divided areas in Japan in a way that favored his political party. This action was called a Hatomander.

The opposite type of relation also exists. Many family names are taken from ordinary words, in particular words for occupations, making names like Smith, Miller, Farmer, Baker, Cooper, Wright, Potter, Fisher, and Hunter very common.

Names need not refer only to specific people. They may simply be used in a metaphoric fashion to refer to someone else who happens to exhibit the same traits as the person named. For example, \*She's the Madonna of our neighborhood," or "He's completely Ollie North."

Place names can become common words, too, although they remain as the name of the place. Almost any place name can be turned into an adjective. There are Hollywood jeans, Parisian nights, and Santa Ana winds. This doesn't mean that the jeans, the nights, or the winds come from these places but rather that some quality of the place has been used as an attribute of the words they modify. Place names have also become nouns. Camembert (cheese) and limousine are named after places in France. Charleston, the dance, is also the name of an American city. Tabasco (a sauce) is the name of a river in Mexico. Diseases are often named for the place in which they first occurred (Rocky Mountain spotted fever).

Some names may have multiple origins. For example, it's not clear whether a name such as Bower means someone who makes bows, if it compares the person to a flower bower, if it comes from the German Bauer meaning farm laborer, or perhaps some other source. Children may be named not only after famous people but also after places and even natural disasters. Mamdouh Hassan writes thar after the Cairo earthquake, one child was named Mohamed Zelzal (zelzal $\eqcirc$ earthquake) and there are similar reports of San Francisco babies being given the middle name Quake.

Ordinary words can also become the basis of place names. The town of French Lick, Indiana, is located in the Ohio Valley which was once covered by an inland sea in which salt accumulated. The salt springs in the valley are called licks because the cattle, buffalo, and deer would lick the earth to get at the salt. So there are towns called Elk Lick, French Lick, Salt Lick, and Blue Lick in that area.

Place names can usually be traced through the history of an area. Many place names along the California coast came from Hokan (the language of the Chumash Indians): Ojai, Lompoc, Point Mugu, Pismo Beach. 'Awhay is the word for moon; Lompo' means stagnant water; Muwu

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

means beach; and Pismu' means tar. Nobody goes to view the flower fields in Lompoc thinking that they are going to an area of stagnant water. Place names in California also reflect the mingling of its two major colonizing forces. In the southern part of the state, Spanish-speaking explorers used their calendar of saints' days to name places (San Bernardino, San Jose, San Juan Capistrano). In the northern part of the state, the Argonauts provided names reflecting characteristics of their mining camps (Brandy Flat, Rough and Ready, Dead Horse, Fiddletown, Poker Flat, Last Chance).

In science eponyms abound, and a definite etiquette governs how eponyms are used from field to field. In astronomy, comets are named for the first person who observes them. In other fields, scientists can only hope that their colleagues will memorialize their work in this way. Botanists and ornithologists have been so honored by colleagues; plants and birds carry the names of important researchers. In medicine, eponyms are often used to identify diseases (leading to the humorist S. J. Perelman's quip, "I have Bright's disease and he has mine").

# Practice 8.3

1. Look up the following names of people that have become names of objects: blanket, bloomer, sandal, zinnia, souboise (sauce). Who were these people?   
2. In another language you know, look for eponym examples. How powerful a process do you believe this might be as a source of new vocabulary items across all languages?   
3. In an essay on eponymous science, Eisenberg (1993) says that place names are favored eponyms in mineralogy and chemistry. She notes that Ytterby, Sweden, 'appears in the names of four elements - yttrum, terbium, erbium, and ytterbiumn. She also discusses the use of nonpossessive form when the eponym is from a location (Lyme disease) or from a patient's name (Duffy blood factor) and the use of the possessive form when the eponym is named for its discoverer (Bright's disease). Given that eponyms are common in science, would you point them out to students in science classes? Should they be included in EsP science classes for multilingual students? If so, who should research and provide information on the eponyms to the class, the teacher, the students, the ESL specialist, or the science specialist?

4. The names of important educators and linguists have been used to identify certain hypotheses about language (e.g.. the Whorfian hypothesis) and language learning or cognitive development (e.g., Piagetian stages). Are these eponyms ever used in the possessive form? when two names are mentioned, is the eponym then always hyphenated (e.g., the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis)?

5. It's been suggested that religion exerts an intluence over name giving and when this does not happen, individual taste may run wild. Some names coined by parents are beautiful (as in the name Autumn Brown), and others are humorous or even weird. While working in a personnel oftice, a friend came across many strange combinations. Our favorite was an employee named Crystal Shanda Leer. There were many Ima's and Iva's with funny last names. One governor of Texas actually named his daughter Ima Hogg. Parents also give way to their patriotic feelings; one of our students was named Love America. We have had friends whose real names were Sunny and Poopsie. (Teachers were always insistent that these couldn't be their real names!) As children we played with children nicknamed Buddy, Sonny, and Sissy. Ask your grandparents if they have a copy of their high school yearbook. tf not, go to your library. Check the names (and any nicknames) of students from two generations ago. Compare these with those in a current yearbook. How have the names changed? How do you account for the change?

# Conversion

Conversion is a process which allows us to create additional lexical items out of those that already exist. It is also a process in language change. We like a word so much that we decide to use it in new ways. So, a saw is used to saw, a bag is used to bag, a file is used to file. A flirt flirts, a snoop snoops, and a spy spies.

This process is not limited to one-syllable words. Shovels are used to shovel snow. Bottles are used in bottling and butter for buttering. An umpire umpires a game, a star stars in a film shown at a theater where an usher ushers. Nor is the process limited to the creation of verbs from nouns. For example, one hears complaints that the student bookstore upped its prices again.

New conversions are constantly being created. Chick Hearn, the sports announcer for the Los Angeles Lakers, says that Kareem abdul-Jabbar used to "vacuum it in and sky hook, it for two," meaning that he pulled in the ball and got it in the basket. He says that a running player "greyhounds it down the floor," that Magic Johnson "cross-courts the ball,

but it's fly-swatted away." A woman says that she'll "microwave the chicken." A teenager says he will "flea our dog." An invitation to an art galiery opening says, "We will of course quiche and perrier you." People talk about "zip-coding their letters," "trashing papers," "carpooling people." They say they will "Haagen-Daz" or "pizza a bitr before they "freeway" on home.

Ankist (1985) classified noun-to-verb conversions according to patterns. These included such things as applying or removing what the parent noun denotes (e.g., "newspaper the shelves"; "flea the dog"); to go to or perform an activity at a place denoted by the parent noun (e.g., "to youth-hostel Europe," "to jacuzzi"); to apply duration or time as denoted by the parent noun (e.g., \*to Christmas in Hawaii"); to behave or take the role of the parent noun (e.g, "to John Wayne it," "to zombie out"); to cause to resemble whatever the parent noun denotes (e.g., "carpool the people," 'to trash the neighborhood"); to produce the process or activity denoted by the parent noun (e.g., "to suction the ear,""to conference"); to perform actions usually performed by means of the parent noun (e.g-, "to RV across America," "to scissor the material"). Thus, it appears that conversions can be used for location, duration, agent, goal, and instrumental functions.

# Practice 8.4

1. Give a sentence for each of these types of conversion.

Instrument: David removed the snow with a shovel. (He shoveled the snow.) saw, hammer, rake, mop, brush, comb, label, elbow   
Goal or destination: The cowboys led the horses to the corral. (They corraled the horses.) jail, dock, bag, bottle, can, house, stack, bale, file

Theme: off or away -- She removed the dust off the chair. feather, pit, peel, scale, weed, shell into or onto  Sue put butter on the bread. pepper, sait, water, plaster, oil, saddie

2. There is evidence that conversion is a process in the language of children. A 5-year-old said:

a. Mommy, I didn't want you to trash it out yet.   
b. Daddy, can you match this for me? (holding up a plastic bracelet she wanted to have fixed by melting the ends together with a match). Another child picked up a worm and, when it wiggled, threw it down, saying, "It wormed on me! If you work with young children, classify their conversions. Are they all nouns to verbs?   
3. Can all nouns be converted to verbs?   
4. To stonewall is a conversion used in talk about politics. List as many examples as you can of conversions that seem to be used primarily in special domains (e.g., offices, movies, hospitals). How might these be related to script semantics?   
5. Here are some additional examples of conversion. Categorize each using Ankist's system: "We've axed the price." "We don't want to scapegoat anybody." "We have to wait-list some passengers." "Don't forget to cc ( $\biggl [ =$ carbon copy) this to everyone." "C'mon, seatbelt yourself!" "They rotten-egged him almost" $\left[ = \right.$ the audience almost threw eggs at a speaker). "You forgot to pickle the hamburger." "The team summered in Colorado." "Carefu! you don't onion your eyes." "We have to accordion the curtains more." "They want to champagne this reception."

# Shifts

The meanings of words themselves may shift over time. The classic examples are knave, which once meant a young lad and now means someone rather nasty; deer, which once meant wild animals in general (so bears could be considered deer); and couth, which meant known or familiar and now survives only in uncouth. We can find examples of shifts in progress even now. The word broadcast meant to scatter seeds, but now it is used primarily to refer to scattering words on radio and television. Drive originally referred to driving cattle but is now mainly used for driving cars. Clearly, what a word once meant is not always what it means now.

An amusing exampie is the word virtue which, according to Greenough and Kittredge (1901, pp. 241-242) is related to the Latin vir, meaning man. Virtue, then, originally meant something like " manliness" in general. Later it came to stand for warlike prowess. Still later, as it passed into French and then to English, it meant power, even magical strength, and it meant a noble quality. One wonders, then, how it came to be applied primarily to women (when it originally meant manliness} as in "may all your sons be brave and all your daughters virtuous."

Shifts may expand, limit, or replace the original meaning of words, in the process either elevating the value of the word or lowering it. For

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

example, the word lust did not always describe moral depravity but once meant pleasure. Lewd meant ignorant. Now these terms have much less favorable meanings, and other words have become more exalted. For example, minister used to mean servant, a constable was someone who cleaned horse stalls, and angel once merely meant a messenger.

Shifts may occur in one dialect of a language and not in another. For example, in standard Italian the word for parents is genitori. Influenced by the English word parents, the American Italian dialect uses parenti (Danesi [1985l). The word parenti in Iralian is used for relatives rather than parents.

Changes in meaning differ across dialects of English as well. For example, the use of the word lumber to mean planks of wood sold in stores is uncommon in England, where timber is used instead. In the United States, timber refers to logs and even lumber before it reaches the market. The meaning of the word corn differs in British and American English, referring to grain in British English but to a particular grain crop in America. (Corn seems to be shifting in British English, however, perhaps owing to the influence of the American use of the term.)

Meanings of words also shift as they are borrowed from one language into another. According to Sonoda (1975), the meaning of loan word raisu in Japanese is restricted to cooked rice ready to be served. The borrowed word feminisuto (from feminist) refers to a man who is sentimentally fond of women. Antena (from antenna) is sometimes used to refer to a tall, thin person. In each of these cases a shift in meaning has taken place as the word is borrowed into the language.

Some words, of course, are so stable in sound and meaning that linguists can use them to group languages into related families. For cxample, the English word hand is very similar in meaning and sound to the word Hand in German. The Dutch, Danish, and Swedish words for hand are hand, haand, and hand, respectively. When we find many such cognates, we can surmise that these words were not borrowed from one language to another, but rather that all of these languages evolved from a common Ianguage that was spoken in the past.

Linguists estimate that Proto-German, the common ancestor language for all languages in the Germanic group (which includes English), was spoken more than two thousand years ago. Knowing that certain lexica! items seldom shift meanings or sounds has also allowed tinguists to look at how languages in the Germanic group are related to other groups that brancbed off from Latin, like the Romance language family (Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, Romanian).

By looking at highly stable hasic vocabulary across these languages, linguists have been able to sbow how they and other families - for example, the Celtic fanily (Irish, Welsh, Breton), the Slavic family (Polish,

Russian, Bulgarian), and Greek, Albanian, and Sanskrit - relate to an even more ancient language family, Indo-European. Of course, the fur. ther back words are traced, the more difficult the task becomes.

We have already talked about cognates in Chapter 6. For linguists, cognates are important in discovering the family relationships of languages. For learners, cognates are important and, so long as meanings do not shifr, helpful. Bantu (1981) argues that students should be encouraged toward "intelligent guessing" when they encounter cognates. Learners clearly hope to find true cognates and borrow when their limited lexicon fails them. When shifts occur in meanings for words with similar forms across languages, however, learners have to deal with false cognates. There are many examples of the negative effect of such cognates on lexical learning (see the Ringbom and Nash examples in Chapter 6).

# Practice 8.5

1. McLaughlin (t970) lists pairs of phonetically similar but semantically distinct words that were derived from a common source word. Use your dictionary to see what details you can discover about when the following splits occurred and why. How do such splits relate to shifts?

to-too mettle-metal human-humane gentle-genteel urban-urbane travel-travail

2. Select a short scene from your favorite Shakespearean play and note words for which meaning shifts have occurred. How important is it that audiences interpret the words you list correctly? If you were teaching this scene to ESL or EFL students, would you point out these shitts in meaning? Why or why not?

3. Hasselmo (1976) studied the vocabulary of Swedish immigrants to America. In the Swedish of Americans who had immigrated to midwestern America, words were found which are now archaic in Sweden. For example, in Bishop Hill, llinois, Swedish-Americans used the following terms:

Bishop Hill Swedish Swedish English blistra vissla whistle dimpa talla tall stoka skota take care of tymla tumla tumble tappa oppna open

Data source: Based on Danesi, 1985.

Which forms are closer to English, those used by Swedish-Americans or those used in Sweden? why do you suppose these shifts took place in one environment and not in the other? Does your explanation work tor the Danesi's parenti example as well? If not, how would you explain it?

4. Table 8.1 presents additional data trom Danesi (1985). In standard Italian, macchina and fotografica both mean camera. Italian Americans shifted to camera, a form closer to that of the English word. However, in standard Italian. camera means bedroom. Why do such changes take place? Is it important to learn the standard (rather than the American Italian) forms.

5. Bantu (1981, p. 136) says that with "due caution' the German instructor can introduce cognates and loan words as part of language instruction in such sentences as:

Ich gehe zu einem Meeting, zu einer Sitzung. Welche Mannschaft, welches Team hat gewonnen? Hast du ein Auto, einen Wagen? Er sucht einen Job, eine Stellung?

The teacher must know that Auto and Wagen are acceptable substitutes in most instances whereas Job and Stel/ung are not. Still, Bantu argues that false cognates account for only a few dozen examples while there are literally thousands of helpful pairs. Do you agree with Bantu? Give examples to support your reasoning.

In this chapter, we have begun to look at ways that languages enlarge the lexicon by borrowing from other languages, using words for new functions and meanings through conversion, or shifts. In Chapter 9 we will continue this theme by looking at additive and subtractive processes used to obtain new forms for meanings.

# Research and application

# Borrowing

1. Romaine (1986) gives examples in Punjabi of the use of markers with borrowed words in what she calls "code-mixed compound verbs." She notes that Kachru (1978) has also written about a similar phenomenon in Hindi where karna is used to demarcate borrowed verbs, as in the example to pity, which has a Sanskrit borrowed form, daya karna, a Persian borrowed form, raham karna, and a borrowed English form pity karna. Read this article and compare the examples with those for Japanese (with suru). Which of Romaine's explanations do you believe best explain this phenomenon? Justify your decision. If you find this topic of interest, use the information collected for Practice 8.1. by your classmates. Are pronounlike verbs (e.g., suru, hacer, or equivalents of do or make) used for this purpose over many different languages? If the data look promising, you and your classmates might develop this as a publishable researcli paper.   
2. Hall (1964) shows the derivation of words from source languages in Malanesian Pidgin, Chinese Pidgin, Haitian Creoie Taki-Taki. Read this article and others of your choice on the lexicon of pidgin languages. What interesting theoretical issues regarding semantics and lexicon are raised in the study of pidgin languages?   
3. Haugen (1950) categorizes four major types of borrowing. Hybrid loanwords result from the blending of words from two languages. The word pronounced /blaUmscliwapal/ is from Pennsylvania German blaUm (plum) and English pie. Loan translations are another form of borrowing where the word is directly translated into the native language form. Examples like English skyscraper, French gratte-ciel, and Spanish rascacielos are also sometimes called calques. A third type of borrowing is the semantic loan. Haugen gives the example of the Arnerican Portuguese form humoroso, which has taken on the meaning of the Enghish word humorous instead of retaining the meaning of capricious which it has in Portuguese. Loan homonyms are also exemplified in American Portuguese. The Portuguese word grosseria means a rude remark. The English word grocery sounds similar, so now grosseria is used for both a grocery and a rude remark. Relate these categories to Ringbom's (discussed in Chapter 6). Prepare a preliminary methodology for classifying data that you might obtain in your own research on errors, loans, and borrowed words used by language learners.

4. Otto Jespersen, the famous Danish linguist, wrote about borrowing as part of his classic book, Growth and Structure of the English Language (l938). A short excerpt, "Borrowing from the Normans," is reprinted in Laird and Gorrell (197l). How do you account for the fact that borrowing from French did not increase immediately after the Norman conquest but orly Iater? Give as many reasons as you can for why this delay should be expected. In what types of cases would you expect no borrowing to occur?

5. Loanwords have been extensively studied in Japanese. More than twenty dictionaries related to loanwords were published from 1912 to 1935, and a journal on loanwords was published between 1932 and 1938. More current dictionaries list from 6,400 very commonly known to 16,000 newer loanwords, and books offer suggestions for correcting errors in the use of loanwords and for utilizing loanwords in learning English vocabulary. Review the history of English loanwords in Japanese (or in another language of your choice).

6. Stoffel (199l) examined the ways in which immigrants adapted loanwords borrowed from English into Serbo-Croatian. This adaptation included pronunciation changes and adding SerboCroatian grammatical and gender markings. This study is special since data were obtained from different areas of migration: the United States, Canada, and New Zealand. Stoffel found uniformity in the ways the borrowed words were treated by irmmigrants in all three areas. Identify immigrant comununities that you might use if you were to replicate this study with other language groups.

7. The Quackenbushes (1974, 1977) have shown how Japanese makes English loanwords fit the Japanese sound system. Shibatani (1990) also describes the processes of narrowing meanings (e.g., using the English loanword stove as sutoobu but with reference only to a room heater rather than a cooking stove), extending meanings (e.g., using the English loan word register shortened to reji for cash register and then extending that to a term for the person who operates the cash register), shifting (e.g., the English feminist as feminisuto, whicl is a man softhearted toward women or one who treats women kindly with illicit intent), and pejoration or downgrading (e.g., boss as bosu means a mob boss and madame as madamu is a female owner of a bar). Read and critique this research as background for a study of your own on lexical borrowing in other languages. Can you show the same sound changes and the four types of processes in that borrowing?

8. Kimura (1989) found that Japanese students of English were better able to offer definitions for English words if there were corresponding loanwords in Japanese than if no loanword existed. After giving the definitions, the students were also asked to rate their confidence in the definitions. Again, they were more confident of the definitions that they had given for words for which there were corresponding loanwords in Japanese. Kirura therefore asserted that teachers of English to Japanese speakers ought to give special attention to loanwords in instruction. How might you integrate this issue into your response to 7?

# Person and place names as lexical items

9. Marmaridou (1989) examined both the referential and connotative use of proper names in communication. Collect examples of names used in a connotative or metaphoric way. What patterns do you see in their selection and use?

# Meaning shifts and conversion

10. Select one language of your choice and trace its family classification. If you select one of the Oid World languages, consult Ruhlen (1987). If you select one of the American languages, consult Greenberg (1987) or Campbell and Mithun (1979). Greenberg has also written on African language families. Give example words that show how the language classification was obtained. How important is shift vs. stability in this kind of linguistic analysis?

1l. Sometimes words are borrowed and pronunciation changed so that items that can be thought of as polysemes in English become separate words. Morimoto (1983) gives several examples. The word iron, for example, has been borrowed into Japanese but has two different pronunciations according to meaning. The pronunciation /aian/ means a metal-headed golf club, but /airon/ means the device to press clothes. The word strike is also represented differently. The pronunciation /sutoraiku/ is used for a strike in baseball and bowling whereas /sutoraiki/, with a different final vowel, is used for a labor strike. He found that the katakana transcriptions of these words substantiate the claim that these have become separate words in Japanese, not polysemes. Consider loanwords with polysemous meanings. Has the pronunciation changed as these are nativized into the language? Would you agree that they have shifted enough to be considered new words?

12. Walsh (l993), in an article on the publication of Le Dictionnaire Quebecois d'Aujourd'hui, notes that the government runs tele

Vocabulary, semantics, and language education phone hot lines offering tips on how to avoid anglicisms like le shopping, which is used frequently in France. (Le magasinage is the preferred term in Quebec.) Jean-Claude Boulanger, a lexicographer at Universite de Laval, estimates that about 90 percent of the words in the dictionary are standard international French; the rest are unique to Quebec. Examples include pantoute for pas du tout; cave, the French word for basement but used to mean an idiot; and the clipped form char from the French chariot to mean a car. It also includes entries inarked as Anglicisms (Ie fonne for fun, Ie free for all, and triper, which means to get excited about something or have a trip about it). Boulanger says tle dictionary will not lead to language deterioration, as critics claim. As a lexicographer, he defends the dictionary against those who would elinunate all Quebecois forms: "I can't leave out such words. It would be as if I didn't like the word table, so I just left it out." Why do English-speaking countries not establish hot lines to prevent shifts and borrowed forms from crossing from one dialect to another? (Actually, the British Broadcasting Corporation does circulate lists of American forms that should be avoided by their news commentators. If you can obtain a copy, comment on the words selected for this special treatment.)

# : Processes in word building

Shifts and conversions, coinage, eponyms, and borrowing help us increase the word stock of languages, yet there are other processes that do this in even more powerful ways. These are additive and subtractive processes that result in simple and complex word formations. Weinreich (1969) said that it would be helpful to have a simplex dictionary and, in order to locate all words, a "complex dictionary in which would be entered all compounds, complex words, idioms, phrases, and sentences familar to speakers of the language." We will discuss each process for obtaining complex forms and some that subtract to form shorter, more simple forms.

It seems almost arbitrary that some meanings are held in single words and others in several words. Telephone is a single word but call up is two. Once is one word but one time is two. A word in one language may be two in another. Cheap is bon marche, two words in French. Last night is two words in English, but one, anoche, in Spanish. Whether one word or two, each stands for a single meaning. The variety of ways in which single meanings are built up out of two or more words include both additive and reduction processes. First we will consider additive processes, which create compounds, reduplications, phrasal collocations, idioms and proverbs.

# Compounding

For English, compounding is perhaps the most powerful word huilding process. The most common compounds are two nouns combined to create a meaning which differs from that of each of its parts, as in fire engine or toothbrush. However, compounds can be quite lengthy. Ads proclaim a "no-cost-to-you gift" or an "absolute money-back guarantee"; statistics books talk about the "b-slope regression line"; and we listen to songs with lyrics that say "I've got those God-why-don't-youlove-me-oh-you-do-I'll-see-you-later-Blues" (from Sondheim's Follies). One would think that there must be some cut-off point where the length of the compound makes processing difficult. However, it is not uncommon to find three-, four-, or five-part compounds (e.g., garbage can collector, map-making geography class, affirmative action/equal opportunity employer).

Some linguists have tackled the problem of defining a compound in English. One test has been that if word stress falls on the first part of the compound, then it is truly a lexical compound. This would make armchair and working paper compounds, whereas rough draft and chocolate cake would be classified as phrases made up of nouns modified by adjectives. However, chocolate cake, cherry pie, and the New York Times Magazine (though they carry stress on the final noun) are all recognized as meaningful objects in and of themselves. So for us, these will be con. sidered compounds, too.

A second test is whether the traditional patterns for adjectives can be used - can very or rather precede the compound? According to this test, tall man is an adjective plus noun, not a compound word. We probably would all agree that spacecraft is a noun formed from two nouns, but what about flying spacecraft? Flying behaves internally like a verb but here it looks like an adjective. Yet we cannot modify it with very (\*a very flying spacecraft") so according to the second test it is a compound. Verbs can be modified by very much. "The story interested me very much" can be changed to "a very interesting story." But "the spacecraft flew very much" cannot be changed to "a very flying spacecraft." So, it's not clear that flying in \*flying spacecraft" is either a noun or an adjective. So, for now,we will call forms such as flying spacecraft compounds.

Frequently we can see how compounds evolved by grouping them according to a similar underlying semantic relation. A brick wall is a wall that contains bricks. A chocolate cake is a cake that contains chocolate. Ice water is water that contains ice. A picture book is a book that contains pictures. However, the pattern does not fit all such compounds. Family man, rattlesnake, and ice cream do not fit the pattern.

If we look carefully at compounds, we see that there are many different lexical relationships behind the compounds. Miller (1991) lists several relationships:

Cause: tear gas, sleeping pill   
Have: bull's eye, picture book, writer's cramp   
Make: rainwater, daisy chain   
Use: waterwheel, steam iron   
Be: whitecap, target site   
In: house cat, country club, hillbilly   
For: ashtray, fish pond   
From: fingerprint, sea breeze   
About: tax law, book review

Notice that these all meet the linguistic test for true compounds - the stress falls on the first part of the compound.

While we have noted that many compounds are made up of pairs of nouns, all types of combinations are possible. Killjoy combines a verb and a noun. Greenhouse combines an adjective and a noun. Windbreak combines a noun and a verb, make-believe combines two verbs. Runoff combines a verb with an adverb, and the reverse combination is shown in downpour. Two adjectives can be combined, as in redhot. It appears that almost any combination is possible.

Of course compounding is not limited to English. Italian has many verh-plus-noun compounds. For example, portacenere combines the Italian words for carry and ash. Stuzzicadenti comhines pick at and teeth. German has even longer examples of compounds than English. It is said that the longest compound in German is der Donau/dampf/schif/ fahrts!gesellshafts/kapitan/anwarter, a Danube steamship travel company captain applicant.

You night wonder why we create compounds when it is possible to say the same thing without the compound. After all, we can say, $\mathbf { \mu } ^ { \star } \mathbf { I }$ like cakes that are chocolate"; we don't have to use chocolate cake to convey that information. Compounds are useful ways of condensing information and they add variation to the way we refer to concepts in discourse. For example, in a composition we might begin by talking about cuts in education and then later refer back to this as education cuts. On a campus having fiscal problems, we can say that students have organized a protest against hikes in their tuition fees. Later in the discourse, we might refer back to this with the compound tuition fee hike campaigning.

Compounds allow us to condense information that has already been presenred. Dressler (1985) gives examples of compounds serving similar discourse purposes across languages. Here are his examples from Italian and German literature:

First mention of topic:

che I'aveva piantata dopo due ann per andare a combattere nei Marocco stufo   
di litigare con lei   
(her husband who left her in the lurch in order to go fighting in Morocco,   
weary of quarreling with her!

Topic resumed three pages later:

nel corso dei loro litigi pre-Marocco (in the course of their pre-Morocco quarrels)

First mention of topic: Nur eine Jungkuh ging auf das Eis (Only a baby cow went on the ice)

Later reference: Die Eiskuh (The ice cow)

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

Compounds provide us new ways to refer to the same information, as well as condense the information. They are for that reason often used for newspaper headlines and advertisements and announcements, where space is at a premium.

# Practice 9.1

1. As a review ot Chapter 4, assign relation labels (using Mel'cuk's classification terms) to the relations shown in Miller's list.

2. Can you tit each of the following compounds into one of Miller's patterns? If not, what other relations would you suggest? Are these covered in Mel'cuk's list?

blackboard growing pains cable car playboy landslide piggybank eyestrain chocolate chip cookie daredevil sweet talk

swimsuit lie detector birth control loudmouth freeway report

3. Patterson and Cohn (1990) list a number of innovative original compounds produced by Koko, a lawland gorilla who is being taught American Sign Language. Can you fit each of the following examples into one of Miller's categories? Would you say that Koko can produoe metaphors?

Item Compound sign celery lettuce tree frozen banana truit lollipop tapioca pudding milk candy stale sweet roll candy rock

4. In rapid reading, we may misjudge the stress pattern and at least momentarily read a compound as an adjective plus noun, or vice versa. The San Francisco Chronicle (November 1, 1991) listed a group of heroes including "Wilbur J. Wetzel, 42, of San Jose, who pulled a fallen woman from train tracks, June 11, 1990." List examples of ambiguity with compounds (and the humor inherent in many such examples). Why would you expect to encounter more of these in reading than in listening comprehension?   
5. Collect examples of compounds from newspaper headlines. In this section, we talked about the use of compounds ta refer to earlier information in text. In the case of

newspaper headlines, however, the compound sets up information which may then be elaborated in the following text. For example, the headline "Woman Drowns in River Plunge" was collected by van Dijk (1985, p. 122). The text then goes on to say that her car "plunged t5 feet down an embankment into the rain-swolien River Sevem." Give examples where the compounds are or are not later clarified in the text. What reason can you give for the cases where no explication is offered?

6. English compounds can be a source of wordplay. For ex. ample, Nilsen and Nilsen (1982, p. 274) have a rhyming game for compounds where students make up new names for their courses:

Course name Physical Education Plant Biology Field Biology Human Biology

Rhyming name Socks & Jocks Weeds & Seeds Bag 'em & Tag 'em Cuts & Guts

Are the names of your courses all noun compounds? 1s it easy to find rhyming synonyms for them? Could you do the same thing in another language you know?

7. Although English and German use many noun-noun compounds, French does not. Newmark (1988) asks student translators how to translate nerve ce// into French (can a cell be nervous?) and travail musculaire into English (can work be muscular?). Add an example from another language to each of the following correspondences. How many are noun-noun compounds? Is the form you supplied more similar to French or to English and German?

heavy labor, travait musculaire, schwere Arbeit   
runaway (galloping) inflation, galoppierende Inflation, I'inflation galopante   
govemment securities; effets publics; Staatspapiere (Staatsanleihen)

# Acquisition of compounds

There is disagreement as to whether compounds are acquired as single lexical units or whether compounds are created from their parts. In her famous study, Berko (1958) asked young children why compounds like Thanksgiving and Sunday have the names they do. Children who were

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

quite competent in creating new compounds (they could, for example, create the term wughouse for the home of an imaginary animal) did not, in turn, analyze compounds in terms of their parts. They didn't think Thanksgiving had anything to do with giving thanks but rather with eating turkey. And, for them, Sunday is called Sunday because that is when you go to church.

Even though many languages use compounding to create new words, second language learners often find these forms difficult. Learners are not always sure whether the compound is possible. For example, an American Sign Language student describing the collection of sap from rubber trees wrote, "Every day, one times a line. So then that's thing is like water. Rubber water, maybe." If the L1 and L2 both use compounding extensively, learners may try to translate the L1 forms directly to the L2. Nemser (1991) gives examples of such loan translations: ill car for ambulance from the German Krankenwagen; Alp dream for nightmare from the German Alptraum; and sidejump meaning an extramarital adventure from Seitensprung.

A second problem for learners relates to the order in which the parts of the compound appear. There are pie apples and apple pies, there is gumchewing (often used as an adjective to describe a person) and chewing gum. This, undoubtedly, is confusing to an L2 learner as shown in word order errors:

I planning to get master's degree in engineering economics.   
Another course is making decisions.   
All time I have my book map in my car.   
AAA is very useful for the stranger people. (Spanish L1. Source: K. Schlue, 1976)

Prince married shoes girl.   
Soldier have a glasses shoes.

(Japanese L1. Source: T. Shirahata, 1988)

Near Washington George Bridge.   
We eat in room banquet.

(American Sign Language L1. Source: L. Hunt)

Such errors suggest that learners do not learn all compounds as single new items but rather put the parts together to create the compounds. ln doing so, they may use the typical word order of their first language. Another possibility is that they place the words so that the meaning on which they want to focus comes first and then the modification or comment part is added.

It is also possible that students are unaware that compounding is a very general process in English. This would account for the relatively low appearance of compounds in the compositions of international students.

They may also want to avoid as many errors as possible, and low produc tion may reflect this avoidance.

Case studies show that learners who once produced correct compounds later make errors in word order. For example, Olshtain once told us that her children, returning to their home in Israel after a period in the United States, began to produce errors such as chip chocolate, pin hair, and tape scotch. Again, this gives some support to the notion that compounds are not initially stored as single lexical units. It is also possible that word order of the native language might either promote or reinforce such errors.

Case studies also show strategies beginning learners use when unaware that compounding is a possible choice. For example, Ricardo, a teenage Spanish speaker learning English (see Butterworth & Hatch, 1978) often used a for phrase rather than compounds. Examples include \*shoes for water ice" (ice skates), "one man is clean for clothes" (dry cleaner), "in house one machine for hot" (space heater or hot air furnace), "this shoes for skiing" (ski boots), "rooms for sleep" (bedrooms).

Compounding is a powerful word-building process in English and a very common process in many languages. Nevertheless, learners often avoid or experience difficulty in learning less common compounds as they acquire the language. Part of the difficulty has to do with variability of word order within the compound.

# Practice 9.2

1. Give examples of compounding in a language you know or are studying. Estimate how productive the process is. If there is a set word order for compounds, describe it. On the basis of this description, make hypotheses about how easy or difficult it rmight be for learners to acquire compounds in this language. Alternatively, make hypotheses about the ease with which speakers of this language might acquire English compounds.

2. Shapira (1978) includes data where a Spanish-speaking woman learning English produces errors in compounds. Examples include:

The dry machine no work.   
The water hot is ready.   
You know the people Ecuador is very nice.

How might you explain such errors in the language of beginners learning the tanguage without instruction?

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

3. An elevator in Belgrade's Slavija Hotel is reported to have the following English instructions:

To move the cabin push button of wishing floor. If the cabin should enter more persons, each one should press number ot wishing tloor.

If you have a collection of English language directions, which have been translated from another language, such as assembly directions for products, check for strange compounds. How would you account for the errors? In writing notes in English about papers written in French, we have found we make many word order errors in our compounds. Would your explanation also hold for such errors? 4. A Japanese woman talked about a footnote story that she had heard about the royal couple. She meant gossip or a story that is going the rounds. If you know Japanese, comment on whether this innovative compound is a loan transIation. If it is not, what other explanation can you offer?

# Reduplication

Another additive process is that of repetition. The process of reduplication is not a powerful one in English, but it is in many languages of the world. We have English words like flip flop, hush-hush, and honey bunny where all or parts of the words are repeated to add quantity, intensity, or smallness qualities by repetition or elongation. Other examples are repetitions of words within a sentence context: "I'in very very sorry," "He ate lots and lots of salad,n "I bought this set of teeny, tiny earrings," or "time after time." We also may lengthen (reduplicate) sounds within words to intensify or change meanings (e.g., "He's real baaad!"). Many nicknames and endearment terms are also reduplications.

Although English allows reduplication, we more typically manage the functions of intensification or endearment without repetition. We have the option of saying "It's a small, small world" but, other than in song, we are more likely to say, "It's an incredibly small world," to emphasize its smallness. We can say \*She giggled and giggled," but we also have the option of saying "She had the giggles," "She giggled uncontrollably," or "She giggled and laughed." In some cases, the result of synonyms and repetition is a bit puzzling as in, "Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep." (Psalms 121:4) or the two-language repetitions as in the name of a baseball team called the Los Angeles Angels, or the La Brea tarpits.

In other languages, reduplication may be much more consistently used for endearment, affection, or intensification functions. Some languages also use the reduplication for other meanings. Ilocano, one of the major Ianguages of the Philippines, uses it for plurals:

Translation Singular Plural dish pingan pinpingan field talan tatalan life biag bibiag head ulo ululo

(Data source: Gleason, 1955, p. 32; used with permission)

Vietnamese, too, uses reduplication but for a different function:

luon luon often always nho nho smallish buon buon a little sad cham cham rather slow chua chua rather sour cay cay rather hot (Data source: V. Wenzell)

Here reduplication qualifies the strength attributed to the adjective or adverb.

Reduplication is not limited to languages of southeast Asia. Reduplication is one way of forming plurals in Nahuatl (an American Indian language spoken in Mexico) although there are also certain suffix changes involved as well:

Translation Singular Plural chief tecuhtli tetecuhtin lord pilli pipiltan hare cihtli cicihtin coyote coyotl cocoyomch (Data source: F. Berdan)

Reduplication is also a strong process in American Sign Language. Reduplication can change some verbs into nouns. So the sign for the concept BOAT is a reduplication of the sign for GO-BY-BOAT. And MILK reduplicates the sign for MILK-A-COW. The sign for the noun is a reduplicated version of the verb sign.

# Practice 9.3

1. Given nuang means carabao or water buffalo in llocano, what prediction can you make for the plural form? Given trong for white in Vietnamese, what prediction can you make for "rather white?" The Nahuatl data are especially interesting because all the examples are +animate. It turns out that inanimate nouns are not marked for plurality. Do

you know of any other languages where plurals are not used for inanimate objects?

2. Tagalog, the official language of the Philippines, also uses reduplication of parts of words to change the meaning of the word. Look at the following data and try to discover what is reduplicated and identify the change in meaning.

basah read bumabasah reading buhat lift bumubuhat lifting ka?In eat kUmaka?In eating lakad walk Umalakad walking pasok enter pumapasok entering (Data source: J. D. Bowen)

3. In the following Hopi (American Indian) example, the colon means that the final vowel is long. What is reduplicated and what change in meaning occurs in the word?

ho'ci: it forms a right angle   
ho'cicita: it is zigzag   
wala: it gives a slosh   
walalata: it is kicking up a sea   
riya: it makes a quick spin   
riyayata: it is whirling   
hero: he gives an internal noise   
herorota: he is snoring   
yoko: he gives one nod of the head   
yokokota: he is nodding   
ripi: it gives a flash   
ripipita: it is sparkling

(Data s0urce: Whorf, 1936)

4. There are some special types of reduplication in English. What does it mean when a friend says, "That's a quake quake, not an aftershock!" (when the house shook again a few hours after the 1994 Los Angeles earthquake) or friends compliment a dog, "That's a real dog dog" (in contrast to, say, a miniature purebred). You have probably heard other expressions like 'a writer's writer' or an "actor's actor." List your own examples. How regular and pro ductive is this process? That is, can any noun be duplicated and can we add a possessive to any profession to obtain this meaning?

5. There are lots of jokes based on forms of reduplication. Here, however, the repetition in meaning changes in form. Add as many examples as you can to the following list of "OK?" jokes.

# Processes in word building

Cowardice rules, if it's okay with you. Procrastination will rule one day, OK? Synonyms govern, all right?

Schizophrenia rules, OK? OK.   
Amnesia rules, O.   
Apathy ru.   
Dyslexia lures, KO.   
Anarchy no rules, Ok?   
French rules, au quai.

# Phrasal lexicon

Clearly, any lexicon includes a range from simple isolated words to compounds and compiex words, to collocations of words and phrases to formulaic cliche phrases, to tightly bound idioms. In each case, while more and more words may be added, the meaning of the whole lexical item differs from the individual words within it and so such forms have lexical status.

Obviously it is not whether something is one word or several words that makes for a lexical unit. "Accidentally" and "by chance" have similar meanings yet different numbcrs of words. "Once" and "one time," "suddenly," and "all of a sudden" are synonymous but have different numhers of words. Single words in one language may have multiword correspondents in other languages. "In the meantime"' becomes entretanto in Spanish. "Too much" is one word, troppo, in Italian. "By chance" is one word in German, zufallig.

How do we determine whether a phrase is really a lexical unit or simply a phrase made up of separate words. At one end of the continuum we might have free collocation and at the other end an unbreakable set. Think, for example, of the many words that might follow the word read. We can read books, lists, papers, schedules, or we can read slowly, rapidly, with difficulty, or we can read as long as there is light, in the morning, or read in the library, or on the hus. Each of these phrases goes together but the collocations are numerous and flexible. Think of words that might precede money. We can donate, spend, earn, invest, steal, or exchange money. Some of these seem much more tightly collocated (e.g., earn money, spend money) than others (e.g., exchange money). The number of possibilities for collocation with money are much more narrow than those with read. In each case, some collocations (e.g., read the paper, read a book and earn money, spend money) are tighter than others.

You may remember party games where one person in a circle started a sentence by saying one word, the next person added another word, and

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

the next person, a third. The words that were uttered one after another made sense not because everyone knew what the overall sentence would be, but rather because each word suggested other words that typically occur next. So if the first word were Let, you might immediately think of "Let freedom ring" and supply freedom. If, however, it was not your turn and the next person said me, you might think of "Let me help you," and add help. If it had not been your turn and the next person supplied tell, you might think of "Let me tell you what I think" and add you. There are lots of possibilities, and each comes not from an overall established topic of conversation or script, but rather from patterns of words that typically go together.

Let us turn to combinations that are even more restricted. How many words can you think of that might precede probability? Bolinger (1975, p. 103) lists high probability as a strong collocation. We can say there is a high probability of rain, hut if we change this to high chance or high possibility, it does not sound right. High and low go with probability If you substitute strong or great and weak or little, little chance sounds much better than low chance and strong chance is better than high chance. The adjectives that can be used are highly predictable. When this happens they form a lexical unit in themselves. High probability and low probability can thus be thought of as single lexical units.

Collocations become set with verbs as well. Compare the collocation strcngth in another of Bolinger's examples. We say "to take heart/courage/fright." If we try to change these to "what he took was heart/courage/fright," the collocation no longer works. Nor does it work in the sentence frame, \*The fear/ heart/courage that he took was indicated by his reaction." The words are not only linked in a phrase, but the collocation is so tight that the unit cannot be broken up into its elements in normal ways.

There are many phrases where words are joined together in a set order. For example, we say "bread and butter," "this and that," "law and order," "life and death," "yes or no," "ladies and gentlemen," and "ice cream and cake." These could also be classified as tight collocations.

Sometimes whole sentences appear to consist of two lexical units, one a lexical frame and the other a single word. "Down with " can be completed with almost any noun. "What's the use of -- ing?" allows one to insert many different verbs in the blank, but the rest of the utterance is really one lexical unit. Some of these sentence frames have only a few options for the single word that goes in the blank. Few words can fit in the "for ---..'s sake" frame, for example.

Children learning their first language and adult learners of other languages hoth seem to acquire lexical chunks as well as individual words. Long before they learn the meanings of the individual words, they are able to produce greetings like "How are you?" and leave-takings like "Bye now" or "See ya later." Adults and children alike acquire such lexical chunks with facility.

It is clear that these phrases are learned as single units rather than as individual words of a phrase. Consider the adult language learner who used the lexical phrase "see ya at the pole" as a leave-taking signal. He belonged to a carpool whose members assembled for the ride home near a flagpole. Typicaily when they separated in the morning, someone wonld say, "See ya at the pole." He did not break the phrase down into its components but used the chunk as a general leave-taking even in other situations. Another adult learner, Zoila (Shapira, 1976), acquired "pick you up" as a lexical item and never seemed aware that it consisted of several units. She used it in such utterances as, "She want que I go pickyaup Sofia" and \*He pickyaup seven for beach." Other learners, such as the children studied by Wong-Fillmore (1976), are able to use their many chunk utterances quite effectively for hasic communication. If you think for a moment about languages you started to learn, you can probably still recall greetings, such formulas as "How do you say- .?" and politeness expressions like "That's all right." In all likelihood these phrases are as much single lexical items as any word you might be able to recall.

Becker (1975) perhaps best sums up the importance of lexical phrases: "We speak mostly by stitching together swatches of text that we have heard before; productive processes have the secondary role of adapting the old phrases to the new situations."

Because collocations reflect what is expected, we often try to violate those expectations to achieve certain effects. Poets achieve remarkable effects by constructing unusual collocations. For example, Emily Dickinson begins one of her poems with the line "Tell me the truth but tell it slant, success in circuit lies" (italics added). We expect truth to be told straight out, not at a slant. Avoidance of the expected collocation can create new images by drawing on both the expected and the unexpected at once.

# Practice 9.4

1. Certain adjectives collocate with color terms (see Householder, 1971, p. 75). Try to use the word pale with as many color terms as you can. Which color terms can follow the word bright? If I say 1 have a pale red dress, do you visualize an unsaturated red or a pink dress? Try this experiment with color terms and adjectives in another language. Do they match your findings for English?   
2. A friend exclaimed that her best friend had turned into "an absolutely stark-raving  or is it wide-eyed?  techno chiphead!" meaning her friend was spending too much time at the computer. What is the difference between stark-raving and wide-eyed in terms of possible collocations?   
3. Bolinger says that we can criticize someone, saying he or she is "beneath contempt." Try to combine the prepositions above, below, beneath, near, and beyond with reproach and contempt. Which ones work? How does the distribution ot prepositions relate to our discussion in Chapter 5 of Clark's explanation of space and time metaphors?   
4. The poetry of e. e. cummings is filled with collocations: "when now by now and tree by leaf, she laughed his joy she cried his grief" (italics added). Look at his poem "any. one lived in a pretty how town' and think about his uses and violations of collocation sets. Motion and movement of time are especially vivid in this poem because of unexpected collocations of words. List those that you feel show time's passage. How do you think this changes your reading of the poem? Or analyze Dylan Thomas's poem "Fern Hill." Because it contains so many interwoven themes, you may want to select and trace only two. Or you might try creating some unusual but vivid coliocations of your own.   
5. Consult the BBt Combinatory Dictionary of English to select sets of words which range in the degree of collocation strength. For example, "In court an oath is (given, administered, put) to you." Make up a pilot test of items where choices are available and administer it to language learners. Try to determine on what basis students make their choices.

# Idioms and proverbs

Although we claim that collocations are lexical units, they are not set in cement and there are all sorts of possibilities of remaking them. Idioms are not, either, but we think of them as the set end of the continuum from loose to set collocation.

Linguists like to test whether or not ready-made, chunk utterances are really idioms. Such tests include whether or not the meaning differs from that of the sum of its words so that it is like that of a single lexical unit. The phrase "kick the bucket," meaning to die, would be an idiom. The phrase "hold your horses" would be idiomatic, but "wait a minute" would not. A second test is whether the phrase has transformation deficiencies, that is, can the words within it be separated in the utterance in the same way you might others of its type? Can "wait a minute" or "hold your horses' be separated (in "how long she waited was a minute" or "what you held were your horses") and have it mean the same thing as the original utterance? Clearly, that is not possible for "hold your horses," though it seems somewhat more possible for "wait a minute." Other less convincing cases can be made for tests that show that idioms are often not syntactically fully formed, that is, the idiom can't be used in certain grammatical patterns. If we say, "She holds the horses" or $\yen 12$ kicks the bucket," the meaning changes. Another test is whether the idiom is more frequent than the literal counterpart in text. That is not the case for "hold your horses" or "kick the bucket," but it might be true for "wait a ninute" or "hold it" in oral language.

Proverbs, too, are frozen phrases. They differ from idioms, however, in that they display shared cultural wisdom. Proverbs are so mutually understood, in fact, that in the appropriate situation, we may utter only the first part of the proverb (e.g., "Don't count your chickens" rather than "Don't count your chickens before they've hatched").

Although we think of proverbs as being very bound to culture, many proverbs have equivalents across many different languages.

English: Love is blind.   
Spanish: El amor es ciego.   
English: True love is never forgotten.   
Spanish: Amor que llega a olvido, amor que nunca ha sido.   
Fnglish: Out of sight, out of mind.   
Arabic: Il-ba'iid 'an il-een ba'iid 'an il-'alb.   
Japanese: Saru mono wa hibi ni utoshi.

Though we sbare proverbs with many different cultures, we still must be able to interpret proverbs that we encounter for the first time (see examples from Lakoff and Turner [1989] in Chapter 5). If we read the proverb in Merwin's poem:

Cow parched by the sun pants at the moon

we try to assign meaning to it in the context in which it is offered. Proverbs are not about animals but about people and their lives, and so we assume the characteristic described for the cow are to be applied to people. We see that the cow-person has been burned once, by the sun. Now the cow-person behaves as though it will always be burned. It even pants at the moon at night.

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

If we say, "Let sleeping dogs lie," we know we are not talking about dogs. We assign the instinctual attributes and behavior of dogs (they bite, bark, whine, etc., when awake) to a person. If we bring up certain issues to someone, the person will notice them, a circumstance better avoided.

One would think that all idioms and proverbs would be transparent in meaning but they are not. An ESL or EFL student will not be able to recognize immediately the intended meaning of many idioms (that's why there are so many idiom books for language learners). Fernando and Flavell (1981) use a four-point scale for transparency of meanings in phrases:

1. opaque ("kick the bucket")   
2. semi-opaque ("tarred with the same brush")   
3. semitransparent ("skate on thin ice")   
4. transparent--non-idiomatic; meaning derived from the words in com  
bination ("walk by the building")

The semitransparent idioms in this classification are often metaphors ("add fuel to the fire'). The semi-opaque and opaque idioms differ in terms of intelligibility. The meanings of opaque idioms cannot be worked out from the meanings of the separate words, whereas it might be possible to do so in the case of semi-opaque idioms.

Although idioms and proverbs are not always transparent, learners are fascinated by them, just as language learners we are always intrigued with expressive, colorful language. We enjoy identifying and even using quotable or proverbial phrases in the new language. Young children seize upon such phrases as "okey-dokey," "no way, Jose," while older learners pick up idiomatic phrases like \*"in a feeding frenzy" (a current expression that refers to the media converging on a juicy news story). Idioms and proverbs provide cultural information, and in using these phrases, we feel tbat we are able to identify with (and perhaps show we are part of) the social group that uses them.

# Practice 9.5

1. Select two expressions which you believe are idioms. Then apply Glaser's (1988) tests to determine how well each fits this linguistic taxonomy for idioms.

a. no additions (a \*very wet blanket)   
b. no deletions (hook, \*[line], and sinker)   
c. no substitutions (spilled the \*peas)   
d. no permutations (\*sinker, hook, and line)   
e. blocks predication (sleeping partner -- \*partner is sleeping)

f. blocks comparative (a \*wetter blanket) g. blocks nominalization (the \*playing of the waiting game) h. blocks passives (\*some beans were spilled)

If your examples do not fit all of these tests, how would you grade the degree of idiomaticity?

2. Many dictionaries for language learners list expressions such as cal/ up (meaning to phone) as idioms. Since we can say, "cal/ Sue up' or "cal/ her up,"these do not fit the linguistic definition of an idiom. Instead, they are classitied as two-word verbs or verb $\star$ particle forms. What arguments can you give tor classifying such verb forms as idioms? What arguments can you give against such a classification?

3. List three examples to fit into each of Fernando and Flaveli's (1981) four degrees of transparency for expressions. Scramble the order of the examples and then ask beginning, intermediate, and advanced international students tor the meanings of each item. Does the accuracy of their responses agree with the degree of transparency? Are advanced students more successful in the task? Based on your findings, would you recommend that idioms and phrases be categorized and taught according to degree of transparency?

4. What is the difference between a proverb, a saying, and an idiom? Is "When the going gets tough, the tough get going" a saying rather than a proverb? Are the variants on it (". . . the tough go shopping, go tishing, go to the beach") sayings, proverbs, or idioms?

5. One of Merwin's proverbs is "Big thunder, little rain." Look for similar proverbs in English or other languages that characterize a person who makes a big fuss but never does anything.

6. Proverbs and sayings are a great source of fun for punsters. The sign on a local music store said, "Gone Chopin. Bach in a minuet." Our favorite, though, is \*Though he's not very humble, there's no police like Holrmes." Do you have a favorite pun? You might collect examples from your colleagues and submit a paper on the results to the WHiM conterence. Luthy (1983) suggests that it may be difficult in some languages - for example, Finnish - to form such puns. Can you find examples similar to those given here in other languages?

7. Sometimes learners use idioms but err either in the form

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

or in appropriateness of use. In response to a Iunch invitation, a nonnative speaker said, "Oh, I've cost you a lot of money and I wouldn't be seen dead in costing you more than this" (data source: Stevens, 1988). What is the idiom? What does it mean? why can't it be used in turning down a lunch invitation? Prepare a short lesson on the form and function of this idiom tor adult learners. Do you believe that idioms should be taught only for comprehension and not for production? Explain your reasoning.

# How large can a lexical unit be?

We could limit the lexicon to single words, but we know that a single word for an object in one language may be several words in another (e.g., English potato and French pomme de terre). Common compounds like post office, express mail, mail box could as wel! be written as one word; certainly they deserve to be lexical entries in any dictionary.

Some collocations are so strong that it seems strange to list them as separate words to be combined into the collocation each time we need it. Lexical phrases such as "against my better judgment," "runaway inflation," and "state of the art" have unit meanings that differ from that of each word. Idioms and proverbs also appear to be lexical units. Proverbs and idioms were, perhaps, once actually formed by additive processes in lexical development, but it is highly unlikely that they are assembled from scratch each time they are uttered. Stereotyped utterances like "How are you," "good to see you," "sorry I'm late," and "thank you" also seem to be chunks or lexical sentences, rather than utterances made up of a words strung together anew each time they are said. Even larger chunks exist. It's unlikely that children learn the Pledge of Allegiance or other memorized pieces with an understanding of the individual words they are sayIng. They "pledge a legion to the flag," sing the "stars bangles banger,' and of the "ramrods we washed." Thcy ask God to bless America "with a light from a bulb," and sing of "Gladly, the cross-eyed bear."

The processes that formed these complex lexical units must, however, still be available. We say this because we can create new compounds, new collocations, new lexical phrases, new idions, and new proverbs. And we can use them to understand new complex formations when we see or read them. However, it seems unlikely that each time we use these phrases we construct them anew by combining the words. Rather, they spring to mind and from our lips as do single words.

In acquisition studies and language attrition studies, we see the process at work. We also find that some complex items, in particular stereotyped chunks, are held in memory in special ways which seem to make them especially resistant to loss. Aphasics can often produce an entire chunk but not the words in the constituent. Foreign language learners can often recite whole dialogues they learned many years ago yet they are unable to spontaneously form sentences using the words in the dialogues.

We often think that the unanalyzed chunks of language are trite or cliched, but the language we use is filled with them. Our greetings and our phatic communication (talk when we have little to say but wish to sustain social interaction) are comprised of chunks that we arrange and rearrange to prevent monotony. Anyone who has worked in translation realizes that much of translation has to do with knowing the "chunks" of a particuiar field as well as those of ordinary talk. Much of the predictability of language (and ease or difficulty of translation) has to do with these chunks.

Bolinger (1974) says that "speakers do at least as much remembering as they do putting together." That is, we string together these lexical complexes as often, if not more often, than we string together single words. The complexes vary in how chunklike they are. Some are tight and unbreakable units, others are looser and allow several words to go into slots within the complex, still others are fairly open. If we took at the full range of complex collocations, we find that they are pervasive in language. Because they are ready-made units at one moment and can be divided up into shifting combinations in another, they make the dividing line between syntax and Iexicon very fuzzy indeed.

# Practice 9.6

1. Eugene lonesco's play Les Chaises (The Chairs) is made up aimost entirely of formulaic utterances. Given the predictability of each phrase, closely translating the original French seems impossible. If you are proficient in French, compare the English and French versions and discuss the problems faced in the translation.   
2. Critchley (1970) called the meaningless sounds with which the speaker decorates talk (in fact, y'know, actually, of course, naturaily, as a matter of fact, do you know what I mean) verbal tics. Tape record a casual conversation and identify any of your own verbal tics that seem a bit obsessive. (Or read through this chapter and find ours that slipped into writing!) How easy or difficult is it to eradicate these in talk or in writing? Would you want to get rid of all of them or do some serve an important discourse function?

3. We like to think of our language use as creative and innovative, but if it were, we would not be able to process it in

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

real time. Try this experiment: As you listen to a taped conversation, "shadow" each speaker as if you were simultaneously translating rather than just repeating the message. You should be able to stay with the speakers quite easily, for much of the message is predictable, made up of more complex than simple lexical items. Now repeat the process, "shadowing" a speaker giving a lecture in a technical field with which you are not familiar. If you have difficulty keeping up with the speaker, is the difficulty due to simple or complex lexical items? 4. Read Safire's (1982) essay "I led the pigeons to the flag" for examples of errors of children and adults in reciting and singing formulas such as the Pledge of Allegiance. In language acquisition, we say that comprehension precedes production. Do such errors argue against this principle? Justify your answer.

Just as we increase the lexicon by adding or joining words together, we form new words by subtractive processes where something is taken away from the original word. Subtractive processes include clipping, initialization, acronyms, and blends or portmanteau words.

# Clipping

Clipping is one way in which we change words. We may shorten dormitory to dorm and thereby create a new word, or we may change condominium to condo. We use the longer term if the situation is more formal and the shorter term if the situation is more informal. However, the new term may entirely replace the longer original word. Can you tell, for example, what the original words for psycho or $\gamma _ { u }$ might have been?

Some fields use many clipped forms. For example, computer commands are almost always clipped terms: del means delete, sho cat means display all the files catalogued in a particutar computer account, for example.

Clipping is a common feature of in-group taik and of slang. For example, English speakers in Japan have clipped befriended to friended to mark times when they assume the language teacher's role outside the classroom, as in \*I was friended on the train today" when the speaker was surrounded by students who wanted to practice their English. In slang, the clipped form is often changed to end in a vowel, usually o, which seems to be a favorite way to end many clipped forms. We talk about demos, an anthro class, and porno films in everyday conversation without necessarily considering these forms slang. In Australian English, clipped forms ending with o are so common that the phenomenon is often spoofed:

Thommo, a commo journo, who lived with his preggo wife from Rotto in a fibro in Paddo, slipped on the lino taking a dekko at the nympho next door. He missed out on compo, so he worked for a milko, then a garbo, and took a bit part in a panto. His wife ran off with a muso, and Thommo got dermo and gastro. When he couldn't pay his rego, he tried to shoot himself but had run out of ammo. If the Salvos hadn't found him and called the amho, he could have ended up derro on metho.

(Servisier, quoted in Wierzhicka, 1986, 361-362)

Clipping also occurs when words are borrowed from one language to another. English words are frequently shortened when they are borrowed into Japanese. For example, apaato is the clipped form of the borrowed form for apartment building, suto is the truncated form of sutoraiku, the word borrowed for strike, naitaa is the shortened form of night game for baseball, and depaato is the abbreviated form of department store (data source: T. Morimoto). Gibbons (1987) study of Hong Kong EnglishChinese mix includes such clipped examples as resi (for a member of a residence hall), and Deen gives the example of floppy disk being borrowed into Dutch and then clipped to flop for one diskette and floppen as the plural.

# Practice 9.7

1. List all the clipped forms from one issue of your loca! newspaper. How many of the forms are commercial terms? How many are pop culture terms? How many have remained in the language and become terms of common usage? Would you consider pop as in "pop culture," or "pop art" a clipped form that has been integrated into common usage?   
2. Expressions that were once phrases or compounds may later be clipped. For example, faptop is now used more frequently than the longer compound "laptop computer." How many of the examples you gathered for item 1 are clipped compounds?   
3. Look for examples of clipped English borrowed words in another language. If these languages have few consonant clusters and open consonant $^ +$ vowel syllables (as in the Japanese and Chinese examples we provided), we would expect clipping to be as much a phonological adaptation as true clipping. It you have found examples of clipped

Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

borrowed Engiish words in other languages, that explanation might not hold. What do your results show? 4. Language teachers sometimes include short lessons on clipped forms as a way of interesting students and motivating them to learn new vocabulary. What benefits or problems do you see in introducing such forms in your Ianguage classes?

# Initialization and acronyms

Another reduction process is the use of initialization in words such as FBI, UCLA, or BYU, where each letter in the word is pronounced. Acronyms are words made up of abbreviations, too, but the result is pronounced as a word, not as a list of letters. For example, Unicef, Nabisco, Texaco, NAFTA, and, for linguists, even SLRF and AILA are abbreviations which have become words. The word posh (arguably from portside out and starboard home - the best cabin positions on the trip out to India and back) is a classic example of an acronym.

In American Sign Language, initialization has become an extremely productive process. New technical terms are being added to all languages at an alarming speed, and the deaf need to come up with signs for these. One way to do this is to initialize pre-existing signs by holding a handshape from the manual alphaber while producing a sign. So the sign THING can be initialized with an m to make it MATERiAL, or an e to form EQUIPMENT.

Deaf students sometimes use initialization to create sign jokes. L. Hunt (personal communication) gives two examples. The names of two cafeterias on the campus of NTID (an initialization, not an acronym, for National Technical Institute of the Deaf) are Grace Watson Hall and the Dining Commons. Officially, the signs for both are the initials GW and CD made at the mouth, where the EAT sign is made. Students have changed the places of articulation, making GRACE-WAT\$ON with the G going down the throat and the W coming right back up, and DININGCOMMONS with the C around the throat as if gagging or choking.

Initialization and acronyms are not generally powerful processes for forming new words in English. Still, there are many acronyms in certain fields, particularly those with large bureaucracies. For example, after the 1994 earthquake, Los Angeles residents who hoped to find housing quickly learned that the acronym HUD was not the name of a movie but the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Those who wanted loans had to deal with SBA and FEMA, the small business and federal emergency agencies.

# Practice 9.8

1. Give examples of initialization and acronyms used in the Ianguages you teach or are studying.

2. Look at the following sets for American Sign Language. Each set has one basic sign and added initials that change the meaning. In each set, what do you think the basic sign means?

a. CLASS, GROUP, 7EAM, SOCIETY, WORKSHOP   
b. LANGUAGE, PHRA\$E, CLAU\$E   
C. BIOLOGY, EXPERIMENT, STATISTICS, CALCULUS, GEOMETRY   
3. Prepare a list of the initials and acronyms used at your school. RA and TA are familiar forms at most colleges and universities for research and teaching assistants. Those for the names of buildings are local terms (a student at BYU asked, "What is this 'empty sea?' after hearing fellow students refer to a building as the MTC). Divide your list into common and locai items and check to see which forms the international students know and use.   
4. J. Paxton's Penguin Dictionary of Abbreviations includes a variety of initialized and acronym torms. Using this as a source, prepare a short lesson plan for teaching torms that would be usefut for your students.

# Blends

New words can also be created by blending two or more other words. For example, brunch came from the blend of breakfast and lunch, flurry from flutter and hurry, and smog from smoke and fog. Historically, sparcity came from sparseness and scarcity; splotch from spot and blotch. These blends (called portmanteau words by Lewis Carroll in Alice in Wonderland) have become part of our everyday lexicon.

Again, product advertising, the entertainment industry, bureaucracies, and technical fields seem to produce the largest number of blends. Eurail, Medicare, camcorder, and sitcom have come into the language in this way. Product names are often hlends. Velveeta is a blend of velvet, eat, and cheese. The "information superhighway" will send information down a datapike. The retroactive repair of Los Angeles freeway overpasses by refitting support columns after the 1994 earthquake became known as retrofitting.

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

When we first meet most blends, they seem quite appropriate. Others may be more difficult to process. For example, snarky, a combination of snide and sarcastic, is not easily deciphered. Other blends (e.g., guesstimate, alcoholiday) seem contrived for headlines or other more momentary uses. It is unlikely that mummabilia (a blend of memorabilia and mummy) will ever be used beyond the Associated Press story about a display of "long-forgotten mummies and mummabilia" (Mcquain, 1992).

Sometimes words borrowed from another language form blends via analogy. For example, the Japanese borrowed word sukin shippu $\{ =$ skinship) is a blend of skin and kinship, meaning a relationship that is very close. Nemser (1991) collected learner errors that also demonstrate the blending process. His examples include adjacing from adjacent to and adjoining; self-conceited from self-assured or self-confident and conceited; semiglide from scmivowel and glide. In addition, he gives examples of loan blends, where one part of the word comes from one language and the other from a second language. These blends, produced by German speakers of English, included flutlight for floodlight (German Flutlicht) and dursty meaning thirsty (German durstig).

# Practice 9.9

1. Collect as many blends as you can from your local newspaper. Which seem to have just been created and which do you think are assimilated into the language? For those that are new to you, predict whether they will become ordinary words in the language and justify your prediction.   
2. List as many blends in another language as you can. What similarities or differences do you see to those of English?   
3. What fields do you think create the most blends? When are blends appropriate or not approprate in this field? For example, sportscasters use a device called a telestrator to draw lines and circles while describing playback action. They use the term in talking with each other when they are off-camera ("Ya wanna telestrate this one?") but they do not use the term when on camera.   
4. A recent newscast described the first day of President Clinton's vacation as a Clintath/on, a day made up of an early morning bike ride, a golf game, a discussion ot social policies, a jog, a game of touch football, a visit to McDonald's, and so forth. Is this a blend of the President's name and triathton, or is it a name plus the affix -ath/on? Justify your decision.

5. If you have relevant data, add to Nemser's list of blend errors. Do you think blending is a powerful factor in explaining student errors?

The lexicon of any language is continually changing as new words are added, changed, used, and lost. In this chapter we have seen a number of ways thar words are combined to create new lexical units. We have also examined ways in which word forms are reduced ro create new words. Ir is possible that both addition and reduction will happen to the same item. For example, the lexical metaphor flying saucer is a compound made up of a word for its shape and a word for its attribute of flight. However, the compound flying saucer is easily referred to in its reduced form as a saucer or UFO. Our language laboratory is more often called a lab. We admire a friend's sun tan but may call it a tan. If you find typographica! errors in your papers (or this book!), you would probably call them typos. And, if you are hungry, you may think about a sub rather than a submarine sandwich. The process of addition and reduction continues unabated.

# Research and application

Compounding

1. Clark (l98l, 1983) found that children between the ages of 2 and 6 invented new words to fill gaps in their vocabularies. Some of these were compounds (such as plant-man for gardener). When shown pictures, they created such compounds as apple-knife (a knife to cut apples) and mouse-haf (a hat for a mouse). Very young children, then, have no trouble in forming such constructions. Yet, as shown in the Berko study discussed in this chapter, they were not able to explain the meanings of words such as Thanksgiving in terms of its components. Read and critique this research and determine how you might investigate this discrepancy (with first or second language learners).

2. Dressler (l98s) looks at the use of compounds (such as the "ice cow" example in section A) for discourse purposes in a number of different ways. Read his article and then attempt to find examples of both cataphoric and anaphoric reference accomplished by compounds in a language of your choice. You might select a number of your favorite writers and contrast their use of compounds as cohesive devices through anaphoric and cataphoric reference.

Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

# Reduplication

3. Whorf used the Hopi data in Practice 9.3.3 as one piece of evidence that we use language to organize our experience (whether languages make a distinction between blue/green is another). The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis claims that the structure of a language influences its speakers' view of the world around them. This has sometimes been misinterpreted to mean that a language forms a kind of straitjacket that forces us to view the world in certain ways. Do you believe that Hopi speakers are more likely to notice whether actions are punctual or not because of reduplication? (An Enghish speaker can say "He jumped" or "He jumped, and jumped, and jumped," so obviously the same distinction can be made in different ways in these two languages.) The many arguments about the use of he, chairman, mankind in the literature on gender and language also rest in part on this claim about the connection between language and the way we view our world. State your behef about the inerits of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis (in all its many forms), and give two supporting arguments.

# Lexical phrase units

4. Van Lanacker (1975) found that stereotyped phrases, which we have called lexical units, are well retrieved by some aphasia pa. tients. She calls swear words, emotive expressions (such as "Land's sakes!" and "Oh my God!") and stereotyped phrases (such as "Well, I never," and "I don't know") autonomous speech. Prepare a research plan to test attrition of such phrases with foreign language learners who studied the foreign language ten or more years ago. (Decide whether you need to limit the study to adult learners ten years later or whether you will contrast children, adolescents, and adults ten years later.)   
5. Kotsinas (1983) studied the vocabulary acquisition of her Swedish language students: five adult Greeks and one Polish woman. All learners acquired chunk phrases. Kotsinas especially notes those of Dimitris, who produced such utterances as det spelar ingen roll (it doesn't matter), XHur mar du? Bra? (How are you? Fine?). Other combinations include har inne (in here), dar nere (down there), ga ut (go out), komma in (come in), gd up (go up), du vet (you know), forstar du mig? (do you understand me?). You might want to replicate her study with your own beginning language students. What chunks do they acquire? Do they all use the same chunks? Does frequency in the input explain which chunks are used? You mught

try an attrition study to see what frequent phrases are retained by learners after several years away from the language.

6. Wong-Fillmore (1976), who studied the second language acquisition of young children in classrooms, categorized their most frequently used chunk phrases by function. Consider the following categories and decide whether this would be a useful framework for categorizing lexical chunks acquired by learners you might study.

Attention callers: Oh Teacher, Hey, stupid.   
Name exchanges: What'cher name? My name is X.   
Greetings, leave-takings: See ya later, Take care, I gotto go, Hello, X   
Politeness routines: How are you? Thank you very much, 'Scuse me, I'm sorry.   
Language management: I don' understand, I don' know, How do you do this in English?   
Conversation management: Ya know why? Ya know what? Guess what! Be quiet. Shaddup your mouth. OK? I gotta idea.   
Comments and exclamations: How nice! I'm so lucky! Nuts to you! All right, you guys! For heaven's sake!   
Questions: What's that? How much? Whatsa matter? You wanna play? Can I? You wanna X? Why do I have to?   
Responses: I know. I guess so. Not me! I think so. So what? I don't Care. I don't know, why? Why not?   
Commands and requests: Let's go. Gimne X. Let's trade. Lemme X. Watch dese! Hurry up. Leave it 'lone. Forget it. Get outta lere! Come over here! Help me! Wait a minute.   
Presentatives and parallel ta/k: Here it is. You go like this. Not like this. Fixit up. Put it right there. One more.   
Play management: I'm not playing. My turn. Your turn. Me first. I wanna be the X. Ready, set, go.   
Story-telling routines: Once upon a time. One day the $\pmb { \chi }$ was VERBing.   
Explanations: Because. That's why.   
Wannas and wannits: I wanna (thing). I want some more. I want dese. I don' wanna do nothing. I wanna make X. I wanna do it.

7. The Berhitz method presents learners with sets of phrases according to area of use (shopping, the hotel, and so forth). Do you think that one might learn these phrases as lexical units, memorizing and retaining them for later use? Some foreign language learners can still recite complete dialogues they had to memorize in class but cannot remember what they meant. How might one go about helping learners expand the use of chunk phrases in language

Vocabulary, semantics, and language education use? How might one encourage learners eventually to break up lexical phrases into their components? If you are not teaching, then imagine how you might have encouraged Zoila to use pickyaup (discussed in the section titled "Phrasal Lexicon" in this chapter) more appropriately.

8. Krashen and Scarcella (1978) review the studies of acquisition of formulaic language, routines, automatic speech, or chunks in child and adult second or foreign langnage studies. They relate the acquisition of such chunks to "gestalt" learning and discuss the notion that routines and patterns evolve into analytic language as they are broken into smaller units so that parts of patterns are "freed" to recombine with other parts of patterns. Krashen and Scarcella see this strategy as an alternative rather than the usual route to acquisition. Do you agree or disagree with the authors on the importance and function of "phrasal lexicon" in language acquisition?

# 10 Word classification

Terms used to classify words based on their functional categories are catled parts of speech, which include nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. In addition to these major classes, there are pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections. We will discuss the major classes first.

Word class is an important feature in semantic feature analysis. In each of the following sets of words, one word does not belong. Breakfast, talent, sing, and dictionary are all common words, but sing is an action and therefore a verb whereas the other three items are nouns. Happy, woman, tall, and thoughtful are also common words. Woman is a noun while the other three items are adjectives that describe attributes of such nouns as woman.

The classification of the words of a language in this way is dependent on their function in communication. Nouns can occur in certain places in sentences and serve certain functions. Verbs also occur in certain places and have special functions. So, word class rmembership is an important lexical feature.

If we just look at a word, it is sometimes difficult to know how to classify it. For exanple, book inight be used as a noun in one utterance and as a verb in another. Can might be a noun ("a can of soup"), a verb ("they canned the fish"), an adjective ("the can factory"), or a modal auxiliary ("you can sing"). In some cases, syllable stress helps us determine whether a word is a noun or a verb as with con'duct (verb) vs. 'conduct (noun) or re'cord (verb) vs. 'record (noun). However, this only works for a limited number of word pairs. We cannot change all nouns to verbs or verbs to nouns by changing stress patterns. So it is use that determines how a word is classified.

Children may begin their lexical development by using features that vary along perceptual dimensions (e.g., texture, shape, sound). Though it is fairly clear that children acquire many nouns early (in relation to early acquisition of verbs), it is not so clear when or how the child establishes word classes that are equivalent to noun or verb.

Susan's first word (i.e., recognized consistently by her parents) was /a1:/, a baby variant of light. Her parents would say \*light" as they lifted her so she could assist in pulling a cord to turn on a light. Soon Susan was saying /ai:/ as she helped carry out the action. The problem is that no one was sure whether she was labeling the light itself or the action of turning it on.

Anyone who has worked with early childhood language data realizes that this is a problem. Bloom (1970) took care to annotate her child's utterances as an aid in making these decisions, or at least decisions about the functions of parts of utterances. So, for example, the utterance "no dirty soap" was said as the child pushed away a piece of worn soap, wanting to be washed with new pink soap. Yet, even with such glosses it is not always possible to classify words by parts of speech.

It may be that young children do not have a strong notion of word classes. One piece of evidence for this comes from word association studies such as those mentioned in Chapter 4. If you give adults words like table, dark, and deep, they will likely respond with chair, light, and shallow, respectively. Notice that the responses are the same part of speech as the stimulus word. Young children, however, are more likely to supply words which might continue an utterance such as eat, night, and hole. Although their responses may not show an awareness of word classes, they do show that they have a good sense of what types of words can co-occur.

# Nouns

In a grammar class you may have learned that a noun refers to a person, place, or thing. In Chapter 1, we saw that nouns can be divided into subclasses. Proper nouns, like Betsy, Ohio, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir differ from the common nouns (woman, state, and choir). Abstract nouns like hope, understanding, and love differ from such concrete nouns as dish, table, and chair. Count nouns (books, birds, and pianos) differ from mass nouns (applesauce, gravy, and rice,) which tend not to be so discrete. Group nouns (bank, government, board, fair, club, and choir also differ from other nouns that refer to people because they refer to the group as a unit (" The choir performs every Sunday" versus "The singers perform every Sunday"). We also noted that in many languages, all nouns are classified by gender whereas other languages may group them according to categories that relate to shape, texture, consistency, and so forth.

Lyons (1977, Vol. 2, Chapter 11, pp. 422- 466) claims that all parts of speech have a semantic core that is language-independent. The most corelike nouns (which he calls first order) are names of people and physical objects, and entities that exist in time and space. The objects are those over which persons have privilege. Second-order nouns are observable entities which take place in time. So these would include nouns of states (e.g., sleep), processes (e.g., weaving), and events (e.g., a crash). Thirdorder entities are propositions that are truly abstract entities with no relation to time and space (e.g., democracy).

The more corelike the noun is, the easier it should be to learn. There is considerable evidence that words for concrete, tangible, physical objects are learned more succesfully than other types of nouns. Children acquire the names of concrete items before abstract nouns, and they use more concrete nouns in their talk than do adults. According to Camarata and Leonard (1986), children pronounce the names of concrete objects more clearly than verbs. Aphasia studies have shown that dysphasics find it easier to read common concrete nouns than abstract nouns or verbs. Even in chimpanzee studies, the words for concrete, physical objects are best learned. So, the closer to Lyons' first order the nouns are, the easier they should be to learn and retain.

Some nouns are very similar to verbs in meaning. Events such as swimming, dancing, and praying, which bring verb qualitics to nouns (and have the -ing ending to prove it) are called gerunds. These nouns name perceptually observable events (Lyons' second-order nouns); they are less corelike as nouns. Children may comprehend some gerunds early (e.g., in phrases such as "Stop your crying" and Whining won't help"), but few gerunds appear in their early vocabulary or in that of beginning EFL/ESL learners. Abstract nouns (Lyons' third-order nouns) like democracy, understanding, and responsibility appear much later.

Nouns differ in other ways as well. Some nouns are very like adjectives in meaning. Colors and numbers illustrate this weli. Numbers may be adjectives, as in "It was thirty years ago today" or they can be nouns as in "She's in her thirties." Colors can be nouns as in "Blue is my favorite color," or adjectives: "I'd tike a blue hat."

Although it is often difficult to assign word class status to words in isolation, that assignment becomes clearer once we look at the roles nouns can take in utterances. They can be subjects of sentences: " June has gone to Australia." They can be direct objects: $\ J _ { \parallel }$ wrote a letter." They can be indirect objects: "I sent the letter to June." They can be objects of prepositions: "I sent the letter from the post office." They can even be predicate nominatives: "It's a fantastic airline."

If we take a more functional approach, we could describe the semantic roles that nouns can have, as we noted in Chapter 7. Nouns can be agents, that is, they can carry out actions: "Sue biked to Malibu." They can be patients, receiving actions carried out by others: "Sue crashed her bike." Nouns can he dative, that is, affected by a state or action: "Sue felt so frustrated," "Sue had a headache." Nouns can be benefactive, for whom something is done: "I changed the bike tire for Sue." Nouns can be instrumental in helping to complete an action: "The patch fixed the flat tire on her bike." "I mended the tire with a patch." They can be recipients: $\mathbf { \mu } ^ { \mathbf { a } } \mathbf { I }$ gave the bike to Sue." "Sue received the award for the most flat tires." Nouns can be locatives: "Malibu is a great place to have a flat tire." "Sue crashed her bike near the pier."

The word forms themselves do not clearly determine whether a word is a noun, verb, adjective, and so forth. The function of the word in communication determines its classification. As you can see, nouns carry many semantic roles (agent, patient, and so forth) in utterances. Their roles can also be classified in the more traditional terms of grammar roles (subject, object, and so forth).

# Practice 10.1

1. Bioom's (1970) child said "Mommy sock" as she picked up her mother's sock. Later she said \*Mommy sock" as her mother put the child's sock on her foot. How would you classity the role of mommy in each example? How would you classify each of the words in the utterance "Mommy shirts hot" said while the child's mother was ironing shirts? Is it easier to talk about semantic roles or grammar roles of the words in these three utterances?

2. According to Nelson (1973, 1979), children learn very early the words for objects that are capable of motion. (Balls roli, but tables do not move. The word ball is learned before tab/e.) We also know that children learn words more easily for objects that they can manipulate. Yet Brown (1957) notes that 67 percent of the nouns used by children are concrete and have visual contours (compared with 39 percent in adult data). Do you think that learning is the result of manipulating objects (i.e., children manipulate balls more often than they manipulate a chair), or is it that learning is promoted because objects that can be manipulated have visual contours and are concrete? How might you research this question with young bilingual children?

3. Joan Benoit won the wornen's rnarathon in the 1984 Olympics. Determine the grammar roles of the italicized nouns in the following sentences:

Joan Benoit won the marathon.   
Joan Benoit, Boston's favorite runner, won the race.   
She's a fantastic runner.   
They awarded Joan the gold medal.   
She received the medal on the awards platform.

(The truncated relative clauses, sornetimes called noun adjuncts, are just to see if you are paying attention!)

4. List the semantic roles for the italicized nouns in the following sentences:

Sheila heard shots.   
Her apartment door was riddled by bullets.   
Nobody meant to kill her with the bullets.   
But unfortunately one bullet pierced the door.   
Harry sent flowers to Sheila.   
He always bought flowers for Sheila at the market.   
Harry felt so sad, but there was nothing he could do.   
Sheila was dead.

5. Many languages have special endings for case roles, which are very similar to the semantic roles discussed in this section. Slavic languages, such as Russian and Polish, have cases. Identity the semantic role (i.e., agent, patient) for each of the cases shown in Table 10.1 for the Polish word kobieta (which means woman). Since case Ianguages are explicitly marked for semantic roles, word order can be used for other purposes. Because English does not have case marking, we must rely on word order to carry much of this information.

# Verbs

Verbs are words that denote action. We said that nouns that name states, processes, and events are not as nounlike as physical objects that exist in time and space. We might also say that verbs that denote states rather tban actions seem less verblike. Process verbs which have no definite end points also seem less verblike than strong actions. Vendler (1967) placed verbs into four classes: activities, accomplishments, achievements, and states. We have to think about the whole time frame, however, in order to successfully categorize verbs in this way. Run, for example, could be an activity or, if we run a mile, an accomplishment. Examples for each include:

Activities Accomplishments Achievements States run paint a picture recognize know . walk draw a triangle find love write run a mile lose have drive a car write a letter understand desire seek build hear be (tall) listen to kill see   
look for put

Actions or activities and accomplishments seem more verblike than achievement and state verbs. So again although we think of a verb as a classification, soine verbs fit or exemplify the class better than others.

We know that young children name objects in their environmcnt especially those that are capable of motion. The first verbs they comprehend are primarily action words, such as peekaboo, show X, clap hands, and such formulaic warnings as stop it, don't do it. Brown (1957) shows this continues as children get older. They talk about actions: 57 percent of the verbs used by children are action verbs while only 33 percent of adults verbs denote action. The actions they talk about are those they observe in the here and now, transitive action words (hug, bite) and intransitive actions (go, jump, run).

We discussed a number of grammatical verb classes in Chapter 1 as we discussed semantic features. We know that there are separate verb classes for verbs that do or do not take an object (transitive versus intransitive), do not take the -ing form (\* liking, having), and do or do not carry stative meanings (think, want). In a sense, copulas or linking verbs such as be, seem very unverblike. In sentences like "Betsy is a teacher," "Betsy is sometimes silly," or "Betsy is at school," the copula is links the qualities in the predicate (i.e., silliness, teacherhood, and at schoolness) to the subject, Betsy. Perhaps this difference in function is why the copula is not always a verb in other languages. Nevertheless, in some languages the copula is a verb:

English: I am a student. We are students. Spanish: Yo soy un medico. Nosotros somos medicos. Estonian: Ma olen ajakirjanik. (I am a journalist.)

In other Ianguages the copula function is carried by a pronoun:

Hebrew: Oren hu ha-ganav.  (Oren he the-thief)

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

It can also be a particle:

Hausa: Shii sarkii nee He chief particle (He is a chief) Ruwa-n tafkil nee Water-of lake particle (It is lake water)

In other languages the copula is not represented by a form:

Russian: On student He student (He is a student) classification Etot stary celovek moj deduska This old person my grandfather (This old person is my grandfather) identification   
Chamorro: Mediku si-Juan doctor article-John (John is a doctor.)  classification (Data source for copula examples: V. Wenzell)

Because the copula is used for so many different kinds of sentences and has so many forms (is, am, are, was, were), we can predict that learners of English will experience some difficulty with it. If, in addition, the L1 of the learner differs in how the copula is represented (a verb, a pronoun, a particle, or nothing at all), the production of be may be particularly troublesome.

It may seem strange that a language would not bave any form for tbe copula. Many English speakers learning American Sign Language add one (essentially changing ASL to a form of signed English by finger spelling forms of be). However, even native speakers of English do not always supply the copula where it seems to be required. Consider the following examples from commentary on a game:

Lakers leading 102-97.   
Kareem in trouble! Look out! No harm, no foul, no blood, no ambulance! Magic with the ball, bouncing it up and down like a yo-yo -- slam dunk! Shoots up a prayer and no answer.   
Fast break! Three on four! Two points! Au-to-MA-tic!   
Green, fourth year man outta Washington, looking good in there.   
This game's in the refrigerator, the door shut, the light's out, and the eggs're coolin'.

(Data source: Chick Hearn, Laker cormmentator)

The early language of children (18-34 months) also shows little use of the copula:

That a lamb. Man in blocks.   
That a bear book. It a my book.   
Kathy in there. Tiny balls in there.

Many colloquial dialects of English also omit the copula in certain instances. The following examples come from Labov's (1972) analysis of the speech of young black American males.

a. Before a predicate noun phrase: "She the first one started us off." He a eat-and-runner."   
b. Before a predicate adjective: "You crazy." "I know, but he wild, tbough!"   
c. Before predicate locatives: "You out the game." "We on tape."

In English, the copula has many uses. It can be used in existentials (i.e., presentatives): "There is a notebook in the office." It can be used with various predicates - with predicate nouns: "Betsy is a student"; with predicate adjectives: "The notcbook is blue"; with locatives: "The notebook is in the office"; and with possessives: "The notebook is Betsy's." Although the copula has functions that are not shared by other verbs, we still classify it as a verb.

Auxiliary verbs are also classified as verbs. In English, this includes modals (e.g, can, may, might, will), auxiliary be (e-g., "She is skating;" "They were running"), and auxiliary have (e.g., "She has often skated." "They had already run"). Again, the auxiliary verbs do not fit our definition of verbs as expressing action. Nevertheless, they are traditionally included in the verb category.

As you might predict, auxiliary verbs are not acquired as early as action verbs. Those which have the clearest semantic meanings are acquired first. Can and can't in the meaning of permission and ability appear when the child begins producing three- to four-word utterances: $\ J ^ { \alpha } \mathbf { I }$ can jump." "I can get down?" Can is the first auxiliary to appear in inverted question forms: \*Can I?r " Can Heidi go?" Will also appears early with the semantic meaning of intention (rather than to express future tense): "I will! I will!"

We will discuss the various verb forms in more detail in Chapter 12 (morphology). To review grammar, verbs have principal parts: the infinitive (to ring), past (rang), and participle (rung). They are also inflected for tense (present, past, future), for voice (active, passive), and mood (indicative, subjunctive, and imperative). Let us review tense, voice, and mood in the following examples.

I went to the June Lake relay races. tense: past; voice: active; mood: indicative

Our team had hoped to win the meet. past perfect, active, indicative

We have been running well this year. present perfect progressive, active, indicative

Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

While Sue was running, she got a muscle cramp. past progressive, active, indicative   
If I were in better shape, we still might win. present, active, subjunctive   
Run a little faster!   
present, active, imperative   
The trophy was awarded to the Sub4 team.   
past, passive, indicative   
If we had trained hard, we would have won. past perfect, active, subjunctive   
Our coach says we will win next year.   
future, active, indicative   
He says that every year.   
present, active, indicative

# Practice 10.2

1. To account for the verbs in the on-line computer lexical database WordNet, Miller and his colleagues (1990) used 15 semantic groups to classify verbs: body tunctions and care (sweat, shiver, sleep), change (pacify, computerize), competition (fight, race), consumption (eat, drink), contact (touch, cover), cognition (learn, memorize), creation (invent, weave), motion (walk, run), emotion (fear, adore), stative (surround, equal), perception (watch, spy), possession (take, hold), social interaction (charm, impeach), and weather (rain, thunder). Which of the semantic classes used in WordNet would you predict would be easiest to learn and which wouid you predict would be most difficult? How might you test your prediction? If you develop this as a research project, you might also check your language textbooks to see whether verbs of each type appear.   
2. 1n Chapter 9 we discussed compounds and noted that there are verb compounds (e.g., make believe). In the section on phrasal lexicon, we noted verb lexical phrases (e.g., swing and sway, eat and drink). When do you think children acquire such forms? Do you find any evidence that second language learners, children or adults, acquire these forms early? Can these be used with all the tense, voice, mood forms attributed to most verbs?   
3. Rothstein's (1985) English L2 data of an adult Hebrew speaker show accurate use of the copula in some in

stances and not in others. Can you classify when it is and is not used correctly? what guesses might you have about Hebrew on the basis of this difference?

# Example A

It was very (long). Six month. And my tather was six month. Mymy brother. All the family. It's was unbelievable six month.(The war was very long. Six months. My father, my brother and my whole family were drafted for six months. It was an unbelievable six rmonths.)

# Example 8

What's happen? My-my husband used to meet him one day and he ask him, "What your occupation?"(How did this happen? My husband met him one day and he asked my husband, "Wnat is your occupation?)

Does your speculation about Hebrew hold for Arabic, given the following written data? How consistent is the alternation of copula production in present and past tenses?

My contry was lovely contry betore 100 years aga it was the good contry of all contries. but now My contry is Not good because lebenon I Means My contry the Israil soldier shooting the libanes soldies and the people in My contry No just Israit and palistin and syria everyone shoot My contry. and Now Lebenon crucified on the cross.

4. Look at these self-identification statements of callers to radio shows:

a. I'm Betty $\mathbf { + 4 7 }$ and $^ +$ have uh two teenagers?   
b. It's a pleasure uh $\star$ I'm a writer $^ +$ do not write $^ +$ have no trouble in uh ideas $^ { + }$ I have plenty of 'em.   
c. Well, yes $^ { + }$ I'm $\pmb { 4 3 + }$ have a husband, uh $4 7 +$ been married about 21 years uh $^ { + }$ have difficulty discussing things with him.   
d. Hello, Harry, uhh first-time caller $^ +$ a Libra.   
e. Hi, I'm a Honda owner.

Does the (non)suppliance of the pronoun and copula seem natural to you? when must you supply the copula and when does it appear to be optional? Because the copula does not receive word stress, it is not always easy to hear. Record the start of several calls to radio shows. Can you be absolutely certain whether there is or is not a copula in each instance? If the copula is difficult to perceive, how easily will it be acquired by non-instructed learners? Which is more important in explaining copula use - the influence of the first language or the difficulty in hearing these forms?

5. Wells (1979) notes that can, will, won't, and should are the first modals to be used by L1 children, but that they do not use them for their full range of meanings. Children use can to express their own ability or the possibility that they can do something, and to make requests for help. Will is used for intention and later for prediction. Are these the functions that are first presented in ESL and EFL class materials? Are they the functions that second language learners acquire first? If you have transcribed data of learners, check which semantic functions these modals serve for beginning language learners.

# Adjectives

Adjectives are used to highlight qualities or attributes. Certain adjectives are typically used to describe particular nouns. For example, light, dark, bright, and dull are used with color names. In a scnse, then, we can group adjectives in terms of semantic fields. Geckeler (1971), for example, examined the adjectivcs used with the concept of age in written text. In French, these include jeune, age, ancien, moderne, neuf, and nouveau.

In some languages, adjectives are not viewed as different from nouns. It is difficult to decide if red is a noun for a color or an attribute of something and therefore an adjective. Adjectives may also seem like verbs. Slow can be an adjective when we talk about "a slow race,"' but it could be a verb if we say, "The runner slowed after he cleared the last hurdle." Word forms ending in -ing may be adjectives, nouns, or verbs: "He's my traveling companion." "Traveling is supposed to be broadening." "They were traveling up the Nile." If we are looking at a word in isolation, it is difficult to classify. Once we consider function, however, the division seems more justified.

Adjectives can point out positive or negative qualities. Interestingly, young children seem to acquire positive or pleasant adjectives more readily than negative, unpleasant ones. In second language learning there is similar evidence. For example, Yoshida (1978) found that Miki, a Japanese child learning English, first acquired long, big, new, pretty, nice, and bappy. He learned big and little as a pair very early (this has been noted for L1 English children as well).

One reason linguists believe that positive adjectives are learned more easily is that they are unmarked. If we ask, "How good was the movie?" we do not know whether the movie was good or bad - the value is unmarked. If we ask, \*How bad was the movie?" the quality of the movie is marked. It's already known to be bad. Good has, therefore, a wider range of values than bad. It should, for that reason alone, also appear with higher frequency and with more nouns than bad. Unmarked terms for qualities should be acquired earlier than marked. Some cognitive linguists disagree, saying that whether a term is marked does not make it easy or difficult. Rather, our neural mechanisms always focus attention on new and pleasant attributes of stimuli and it is this focus that causes us to learn positive terms more easily. Others disagree, saying it is degree of emotional value not whether the value is good or bad. Still others would suggest that young children hear positive, pleasant words more often and that frequency should be included in any explanation.

# Practice 10.3

1. In a response to an invitation to join a group for lunch, a nonnative speaker of English said, \*I wish I could, but I'm broken' (example source: P. Stevens). Are both broke and broken adjectives? How would you clarify the difference between these forms?   
2. In Chapter 9 we talked about collocations of adjectives and nouns. We noted that some color names seem to be tied very tightly to certain nouns -- \*red lips," "blackhearted," "green around the gills." Select one color, say btack, and see what nouns typically collocate with this color adjective in different languages: blacklist. Schwarzer Tag, humeur noire, pensees noires, etc. How similar are the pairings across the languages you have consulted? How many of the collocations seem like compound units rather than adjective $^ { + }$ noun?   
3. Some culture groups associate white with death and red with joy (and the color of a wedding dress), whereas in En. glish black is the color of funerals and red the color associated with sexuality. How important is it to teach the connotative meanings of adjectives in language classes?   
4. Gross and Miller (1990) also talk about the scale or gradation of many adjectives. Here are the end points of some graded adjectives. Supply as many adjectives as you can to fill out the scale.

Size: astronomical, infinitesimal Whiteness: snowy, pitch-black Age: ancient, infantile Virtue: saintly, fiendish

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

Value: superb, odious Warmth: torrid, frigid

Is one end point unmarked and the other marked? Compare your examples with those of your classmates. Attempt this exercise in another language. What similarities and differences can you discover? Do you predict that first Ianguage transfer (positive or negative) will be more important than markedness in predicting the difficulty in acquiring these forms in the target language?

5. Subcategories of adjectives -- those that are followed by a gerund, by an infinitive or both - are a problem for language learners and translators. Combine the following lists of adjectives and verbs to form a phrase (for example, "happy to sing," "happy singing"). Which adjectives take a gerund, an infinitive, or both?

Adjectives: happy, wary, capable, wise, sad, suspicious, important, tired, confident   
Verbs: finish, eat, talk, put, sing

Now translate these phrases into another language. Are there similar categories in this language? If you choose French, compare your tindings to those of Flanagan (1990).

6. Gross and Miller (1990) note that some adjectives can occur both before nouns and after BE (e.g., "tall woman," "the woman is tall). Others can only occur after BE (e.g., "asleep). Some occur only after the noun (e.g., \*daffodils galore") and some only before nouns (e.g., "former mayor"). They also include the category ot adjective complements (e.g., "convinced ot," "likely to") and prepositional adjectives (e.g., "on the move"). Prepare a list of adjectives that fit each category and devise a short test to see whether the placement of the adjective is easy or difficult for your students. How might you heip students learn those that are difficult for them?

# Adverbs

Adverbs are similar to adjectives in many ways although they typically assign attributes to verbs, to clauses, or to entire sentences rather than to nouns.

Sentential: Unfortunately, nobody wants to study Quechua at our university anymore.

Clausal: Seldom though it is, we do attract a few students.   
Verb: Some study Quechua very diligently.

Even though they are described in terms of differences in scope, these adverbs seem quite different and we would not expect that they are all learned equally well.

Locative adverbs, like here and there are used very early by young children as ways of pointing to the location of objects. However, it is not clear when they separate them in terms of distance from the speaker. In some experiments, where children must take into account the distance of objects not only from themselves but also from other speakers, the distinction is not firm until about age 5. Even adults sometimes have prohlems keeping the position of speakers and hearers in mind when using these terms! For example, when talking on the telephone, it is easy to become confused about just which term to use: "Y'know it's down that road there -- y'know the one here by our house? - I think it's Pallet Creek Road? You go down there toward the Priory." Such alternations show interesting shifts in perspective.

Time adverbs, like now, then, and yesterday are used by second language learners as an initial way to mark time. This makes it possible to clarify time meanings when more difficult verb tense has not been acquired. Schumann (1987), for example, has shown that learners will use simple time adverbs such as now, tomorrow, always (c.g., "And right now my daughter, Patricia, es 22 years old.") calendar reference (e.g., \*3 April this years coming school") and serialization (e.g. "coming back in Mexico and coming over here") before they acquire verb tense and aspect to mark temporality.

When adverbs are used to modify verbs, adverbs like adjectives use scaled forms. Both adjectives and adverbs can be preceded by intensifiers such as very: ("She's a very talented runner. She runs very fast"). However, intensity can be expanded into a scale such as slowly to quickly for manner adverbs; yesterday to tomorrow for time adverbs, here to there for place adverhs, and always to never for frequency adverbs. In many cases, the interpretations of such scales shift according to context. For example, if you saw three mice outside, you might say that you saw a few mice, but if you saw them inside, you might think three a horde. If you saw two coyotes in the middle of town (we once saw two in the early morning as we biked through Beverly Hills!), you might think that would be a lot. Two coyotes would be a few if they were seen out in the desert. K. Witt (personal communication) says that when she passes a car on the freeway it is going too slow but if the same car then passes her, it is going too fast. When she drives down the freeway at night the traffic is not heavy. However if the same numher of cars are there in the morning during rush hour, the traffic is light.

# Practice 10.4

1. Many adjectives and adverbs, including those referring to dimensions, likelihood, numerosity, and probability, form scales. The interpretation of the value of words on the scale varies from context to context. For each ot the foilowing sets, give an example where interpretation shifts depending on context:

all-none-many-few-some   
ordinary-common-unusual-strange-weird   
necessary-possible-improbabie   
likely-untikely   
always-sometimes-occasionally-rarely-never   
slow-fast   
tall-short   
cold-cool-tepid-warm-hot-unbearable

2. Second language learners use spatial adverbs quite readily. For example, Navajo and Koyukon pen pals whose letters were anaiyzed by Basham include many such examples:

How is it thier? Is it cold? it is hot over here.   
So hows life treating you over there in Alaska, here in Kayenta, Arizona is treating me fine.

Directional adverbs, while easily used, may not be quite so clear:

I go swimming back at the lake.   
All the kids go back to the ball park and play.

What explanation do you have for the use of back in the last two examples? Basham suggests additional information about the local Koyukon culture may be helpful here. In Koyukon, front is toward the river and back is away from the river. The Navajo children receiving these letters, however, would not know this. Can you think of similar explanations for spatial expressions in another language or culture group?

3. No is considered an adverb because is negates the verb rather than just qualifying it. Bloom (1970) showed that there is a semantic basis for the order in which children acquire negation. The three children in her study acquired nonexistence first, rejection second, and denial third. Examples include the following.

a. nonexistence Eric: no more noise (said when noise stopped)   
b. rejection Kathryn: no dirty soap (said as she pushed a sliver of worn soap away, wanting to be washed with the new pink bar of soap)   
c. denial Kathryn: no dirty (said as she picked up a clean sock)

Are nonexistence, rejection, and denial the only tunctions of the negative adverbs in the following examples? If other functions are shown, what name might you assign to each?

No oil is required for this recipe.   
I don't mean to be inquisitive, but --   
Why don't you drop by some afternoon for tea? Can't you get here on time for once!   
I wouldn't do that if I were you.   
I may not be abie to get my assignment in on time. The vector shouid not be measured in that way. Never talk to strangers!   
You're confused, aren't you?

4. Research on the form ot negation has also been carried out for first and second language leamers. There are differences in detait, but generally, negation appears in the tollowing forms:

# Child L1

a. Negation precedes or follows utterance. no mitten no sit there no the sun shining car no   
b. No is placed before the verb; modal+neg is a chunk. That no squirrels he no bite you Don't bite! Can't catch me!   
c. Essentially correct, some problems remain with negation of the do forms. (Data source: Bellugi, 1967)

L2 learmers (Spanish L1)

a. Negation placed before the verb, modal, or copula. I no can see. But no is mine. I no use television.   
b. Negation attached to do, although don't may be a chunk negator. I don't hear. He don't like it. I don't can explain.   
c. Negation is placed after the auxiliary (isn't, can't).

Vocabulary, semantics, and language education d. Analyzed do negation (He doesn't laugh like us). (Data source: Schumann, 1979)

Which do you think is more important in explaining problems EFL or ESL students might have with negation, the number of forms, or the range of meanings? what importance would you give the auxiliary do (rather than the form of the negative) in explaining the data? Do you think all L2 Iearners follow Schumann's stages in acquisition of negation? Give evidence in support of your answer.

Nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are considered to be the major word classes (at least for Indo-European languages). They are sometimes called open classes, which means that new nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are easily added to the language. When words are borrowed from one language to another, they almost always fit into one of these open classes. Nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are also typically content words that have semantic qualities that can be described.

In contrast, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, and determiners are called closed classes because new forms for these functions are infrequent. We do not, for example, create new prepositions or borrow them from other languages. Words in these classes are often called function words because their meanings show how we are to determine relations between words in utterances. Another difference between these two major divisions of word classes is that nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs can be modified with a series of affixes. This does not happen with most function words since they are, for the most part, already affixlike in function - that is, they carry grammatical meanings more than content meanings.

# Pronouns

Pronouns refer to nouns that have already been mentioned in the discourse or point ahead ro a noun that we are about to mention. Anaphoric reference points back in the discourse to a noun that has already been established and cataphoric reference points forward to its referent. In "Enya is called the Mistress of Melody; she sings traditional Irish nusic," the pronoun is anaphoric. In "Since it is a mix of Mariachi and country western, Tex-Mex is yet another example of form meiding in American music," the pronoun is cataphoric because it points ahead to a referent in the discourse.

If you have studied other languages, initially you may have been surprised to discover that not all languages have the same number of pronouns. It may, for example, have been difficult for you to remember to use a feminine or masculine form for you in another language. Or it may have been difficult to remember status or politeness conventions in choosing a plural rather than a singular you when talking to only one person.

We assume that all languages have some way to point to or refer to ourselves $( I ) .$ , to the listener (you), and to refer to someone else (he, she, they). This might lead us to predict that I and you would be acquired early by language learners. Child first language learning research makes different claims about this. Chiat (1986) says that I and it are acquired first and you second. Miller and Ervin-Tripp (1964) also list I as first. They say that they is acquired last, and you, she, and he in between. (They also note that it is easier for young children to produce pronouns in spontaneous speech than in answer to questions where the form changes between the question and the answer.)

Butterworth's (1978) data show the pronouns used by Ricardo, a teenage Spanish speaker who had just arrived in the United States from Colomhia. In conversational data gathered during the first ten weeks of the school year, Ricardo produced the pronouns in these examples:

# Singular

# Plural

# Subject

1st Me go for house. Maybe you me chess speak. I see in Mexico. My father me go.   
2d You teacher. (no examples)   
3rd He understand a little Span- He is and he is. ish.

# Object

1st You tell me (no examples) 2d Me play versus you. (no examples) 3rd I look he. (no examples) Me speak she. (no examples)

# Possessive adjective

1st Come by my sister (no examples)   
2d For you face. (no examples)   
3rd For he clock. (no examples)

Possessive 1st No my i $\overset { \cdot } { = }$ not mine)

There were no examples of reflexive pronouns (e.g., myself, herself) in these data for the first two and a half months. You will notice that there are no examples of the existential pronouns, there and it.

Existential is a fascinating term for pronouns that talk about the existence of objects. In our early lessons we teach students the forms there is, there are (e.g., "There is a book on the table." "There are three men in the picture"). Later on we may add it is (e.g., "It's hot today," "It's time for

Iunch"). The term for the function of these pronoun forms has changed from existentials to presentatives, an example of a new lexical item for an already rather elegant term.

Demonstratives are also used as pronouns. Again, they are usually anaphoric. They point back to some large piece of discourse:

Fashions in the 1980s and 1990s becamc more conservative. This is not surprising since fashions have always been indications of the political and social pulse.

The demonstrative here points back to the fact that fashions became more conservative. Less frequently, a demonstrative can be used cataphorically: \*This is what I want you to work on. Page 31 then 34, ok?"

# Practice 10.5

1. As a review of your grammar school pronoun identification exercises, fill in the pronouns in Table 10.2.   
2. Fill in a similar chart for another language you know. Or, if you would like to try a language you don't know, ask someone who speaks that language to help you till out such a chart. Compare the chart with the English chart. If you see differences (and you probably will), do you think the lack of complete correspondence is likely to cause difticulty tor learners?

3. Here are the subject pronouns for Arabic:

Singular Plura!   
1st ana ihna   
2d inta (masc.) intu inti (fem.)   
3rd huwwa (masc.) humma hiyya (fem.)

Would you find it difficult to remember to differentiate second person pronouns when speaking to male or female Arabic speakers? Why or why not? Is the distinction between masculine and feminine in second pronoun forms common in other non-European languages? what evidence do you have for your answer?

4. Young L1 children often use object pronouns as subjects: "Him did," "Her is." Notice that Ricardo, the teenager learning English used me as a subject pronoun: "Me go for pizza?" why do you think this occurs?   
5. Boyd (1975) looked at the order in which Spanish pro

TAbLE 1O.2 PRONOUN CASE FORMS

nouns were used by English L1 children early in a Spanish immersion program (Table 10.3). Mio was a form used by one very active girl. Other children quickly picked up the form and it became the classroom pronoun for first person singular at the beginning stage of acquisition. Can you think of any reason why this particular pronoun seemed so attractive to the children?

6. He and she are very difficult for many English language learners. One might think that this confusion only occurs if there is no division of the third person pronoun in the L1 of learners. When you notice students making he/she errors, check to see if this is the case. As an example, Arabic has huwwa and hiyya for third person and yet native Arabic speakers confuse he and she when learning English. Compile a list of the first languages of students who confuse these pronouns. What can you say about the intluence of the first language in each case?

7. Many EFL books present all subject pronouns together in one lesson. Sometimes the accusative and possessive forms are in the same lesson as well. Because the forms are taught together, do you think that EFL learners acquire them all at once? How might you go about comparing the order of acquisition for EFL students versus ESL students? If you discovered that in natural, conversational data both groups of learners showed similar accuracy protiles (and these differed from the order in which they were taught), how might you account for the similarity? If they showed different orders, how would you account for the differences?

# Conjunctions

There are many different types of conjunctions, but when we hear the term we usually think of and, or, but. These are called coordinating conjunctions. Adverbial conjunctions (because, while, unless) are sometimes called logical connectors because they clarify the relation between the linked clauses.

In his discussion of clause connectors, Halliday (1985) suggests that we first categorize the relation of the clauses that are to be connected - that is, do the connectors join clauses with two like elements of equal status or clauses where one modifies the other? Halliday calls these two types of relations paratactic and hypotactic. Paratactic means that the conjunction joins two clauses of equal status, for example, "I can and I will." The conjunction and connects two equal clauses in sequence. Hypotactic means that the conjunction joins two unequal clauses. One modifies the Other: "I would if I could."

Halliday then divides the conjunctions according to whether the relation between the clauses is one of elaboration, extension, or enhancement. If we want to elaborate on one clause, we might restate it in a second equal clause, using that is or at least:

This is a paratactic relation; that is, the clauses are of equal status.   
The clauses are paratactic; at least they seem to be equal.

If one clause modifies the other, we might use which or who with a relative clause:

The relation that is shown here is hypotactic.

To extend meanings by adding clauses, we might use and, (njor, but (depending on whether the relation is positive, negative, or adversative). When joining a modifying clause, however, one might use while or whereas.

I want to but I can't. (coordinating or paratactic) While I would like to, I can't. (modifying or hypotactic)

Enhancement includes many categories: some are spatial or temporal, others are causal or conditional, and still others have to do with manner. If we want to express cause, we might use so, for, thus for coordination and because to join a modifying clause:

I broke the toaster so I had to fix it. (coordinating) Because I broke the toaster, I had to fix it. (modifying)

For conditionals, we might use then, otherwise, though (positive, nega.   
tive, concessive) for coordination, and if, unless, although to join a modi.   
fying clause. The toaster works though the toast still doesn't pop up.   
Unless I replace the spring, the toast won't pop up.

One might wonder why there are so many different types of connectors. For example, but is used for contrast, but so are however, on the Other hand, rather, on the contrary, and others. But these synonyms cannot be used interchangeably in every case (Williams, 1991).

I used to think conjunctions were simple; but/however, \*rather, I've changed my mind.

In Santa Monica, it is foggy all the time, but, by contrast, \*rather in Palmdale the sun always shines.

They said the Lakers would win, but/in fact, \*on the other hand/\*by contrast they are already 10 points down.

In their rhetorical structure theory, Mann and Thompson (1989) say that we place clauses next to each other to carry out many different purposes (to qualify, to clarify, to show concession, to show cause or effect, and so forth). However, the conjunctions or connectors cannot be assigned in a one-to-one correspondence to the logical or semantic goals readers or speakers have in mind when they place clauses next to each other. Mann and Thompson find that some relations are most frequently

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

carried by a particular conjunction. If and unless express conditionality; and and or signal certain kinds of addition; because shows a causal relation; even though and nevertheless may be used in concessives. However, it is possible to place clauses next to each other and achieve these same effects even without the conjunction.

Many connectors used in written language are used much less frequently in speech, and some connectors used orally are not used in written language. For example, we often say like or like when if we want to give support to a previous statement we have made. We might say "Yeh? Right but - " as a challenge to a previous statement. It is unlikely thar we would use any of these in writing.

We can safely assume that and is acquired very early and used extensively by young children. It is one of the best ways of showing that you wish to continue speaking. Children are notorious for continuing talk with "and then. . . . and then . . . ." One function of and is to hold the floor. It can, of course, be used to mark an entry into conversation, especially when we want to help complete a turn:

A: We wanted to help so we called (pause) B: an' they said 'get lost', hnnn.

Well also has a special function in conversation. At the beginning of an utterance it signals that the speaker really does not agree with what the other party has said. Because disagreement is not a preferred behavior in interaction, such soft clues both mark and downgrade the threat of the projected disagreement (e.g., "Well, yerright of course, but on the news they said - "). The well links turns in conversation and also shows an adversative position. It can also serve to signal a readiness to end the conversation (e.g., " Well, it's been nice . . .")

A look at L1 acquisition of conjunctions shows us the kind of signals typically used in talk. Bloom et al. (1980) looked at the order of emergence for various connectors in the language of infants. And appeared first and somewhat later was folowed by and then and because. What, when, and so also occurred in early childhood. Others emerged much later. It isn't always clear, however, whether children are using the conjunctions for the same purposes as adults. For example, young children often use the word because when they intend no causal relationship.

Use of conjunctions prior to learning their function is common in second language data as well. This may, in part, be the result of instruction. Connectors are taught, but the function of each may not have been made explicit, as in these written samples:

Tanaka, who was once prime minister in Japan, was born in 1928. Moreover, his family was very poor.

Although it is difficult to define culture. But generally culture is everything about nations received from and possess by different generations including education. But culture is not education.

Another example: if a man has stolen for three time his right hand must be cut off. But the same conditions which are required for death are mentioned in this case.

(Data source: Johns, 1980)

Similar mismatch of connector and function appears in the oral language data of both instructed and uninstructed learners.

# Practice 10.6

1. Mann and Thompson (1989) list many types of relations between clauses. List one conjunction (connective) that you would use to join clauses that are related in the following ways:

a. elaboration b. concession c. background d. motivation e. justification f. cause g. purpose h. conditional i. restatement j. summary

2. The data of a number of second language acquisition studies show the use of L1 connectors in L2 talk.

Spanish conjunction pero: I wait for my cake pero l, I don't know ah what time is coming Pero I need something, I forget in G's room last time betore. (Source: R. Shapira)

Piedmontese conjunction ma: The pay gotta small, ma I eat. In e coal mine I got the water. Ma is dirty this water.

(Source: D. Kitsch)

And there are examples of the use of L2 connectors in the talk of English speakers who live overseas.

Arabic conjunction taakin: True, laakin $( =$ but) it's too late now.

Why do you suppose conjunctions are a place where we unconsciously mix languages?

3. Carter (1992) notes that some connectors can carry a topic-marking function. She examined the use of is and that's why in the oral and written English ot a native Mandarn speaker. That's why and other conjunctions may seem quite normal in the folowing examples; however, the very large number of such connectors point to the special function of joining topic and comment:

# Example A

B: No no talking at all read jus reading. NS: I: see   
B: yea   
NS: boring   
B: YEA! Yea thas a why I hated it.   
Always a memor memorze.

# Example 8

NS: What did you do once you arrived in the U.s.?

B: Uh: okay here. Becuz I em getting old, so, uh I realize. I realize the importance of study an education yea. So I try to do my best to ah study. Firce, force myself to study yea at least. I know that the education is very importan in the future in my future, ya. Thas why, I come, ah I go to school.

# Example C

NS: You don't get summer break?

B: I have too much break actually before Before too much before thats why1 I'm so old now. Still xxx Thas why Playing around too much Yea.

A number of researchers have given us examples of the overuse or strange use of the connectors so, because, and that's why by Asian learners of English. Look at the connectors your international students use in either talk or writing. Do you see any special patterns? Compare your data with that of your colleagues to see if there are definite differences across learner groups.

4. Halliday and Hasan (1976, p. 243) remark that on the other hand and by contrast emphasize an additive, though dissimilar, meaning. Nevertheless, in fact, on the contrary, rather, in any case, and however are all adversative. However and in fact are emphatic. On the contrary and rather seem to correct meaning or wording. In any case signals dismissal. Are these fine points included in your teaching materials for this group of conjunctions? Williams (1991) notes that they all can be replaced by but. Why would anyOne want to learn all these forms it one will do? why would you want to teach the distinctions (if you include them in instruction)?

5. Newmark (1988) notes that Germans use connectors in speech. Aber, aiso, denn, doch, eben, schliesslich, eigentlich, eintach, ja, mal, schon, bitte, and so forth appear three times as often in talk as in newspapers and six times as often in talk as in literature. Newmark believes the function of these connectors is partly phatic and partly to mark the talk as containing old information. Would you predict that the acquisition and use of these connectors would be difficult for German language learners? You might interview German teachers to find out whether your prediction is correct. (You might want to explore the frequency of connectors in other languages as well, using Newmark's article as a stimulus to your research.}   
6. In much of our education literature, subordination is seen as somehow better than coordination. Can you explain why one type of organization should be more highly valued than another? List all the conjunctions in the examples given in this section according to whether they join clauses in coordination or subordination. Can some be used only for coordination and others only for subordination? Can some be used for both? Is there anything preferable about either set? why do some methodologists put such high value on hypotactic, subordinate structures?

# Prepositions

Prepositions are all those words that help locate items and actions in time and space. In this sense they share much with adverbs. We usually con. sider above, ahead, behind, and underneath as locative adverbs because they locate actions or objects or people in space in a natural way. That is, the normal way in which we see things is in terms of three reference planes: one plane is horizontal, a second is vertical, going from left to right, and the third is also vertical, from the front to the back of our visual field.

Prepositions, too, relate to these planes. Cognitive linguists (Fillmore, Clark, and Lakoff, to name but a few) have noted that prepositions also locate along these dimensions. In some cases, the location has one dimension, in others, it may locate things in two or three-dimensional space. To use Fillmore's example, if we say, "John is on the grass," the grass is treated as a two-dimensional space. If, instead, the utterance is "John is in the grass," the grass is now a three-dimensional space where John is inside with grass all around. If we say, "He is at the grass," grass is a onedimensional space. The dimensions are related to to, onto, and into and from, off, and out. Paths across the space can also be traced by via, across, and through.

Catford (1968, 1969) charted these relations (Figure 10.1). We can easily fill in Figure 10.2 for these English prepositions. Because the preceding explanation is experientially based-- that is, it relates to the dimensions used to locate objects around us - you might think that there would be separate terms for each cell of the box in all languages. But that is not the case. In French, all of the two-dimensional exterior spaces are covered by sur. According to Catford, only three markers need to be used in Malay Indonesian: di refers to a static position, ka refers to the end point, and dari to the start point. The other dimensions are not distinguished by prepositions.

Because young children must learn to divide up space as a cognitive task and also learn the linguistic terms for that division, there is a long history of research on the child's acquisition of prepositions. Turton (1966) collected natural production data and test data from 3- and 4-year-old children. He found the youngest children used there and right there to locate items. The 3-year olds also used in. By age 5, they had added on, under, and by. In tests, they came close to achieving the acquisition criterion level of 40 out of 50 items correct with behind. After age 5, they added some of the many meanings of over. These older children still suhstituted by for between, bebind, and in front of. Their nonverbal comprehension tests showed they understood these terms even though they did not produce them.

From a cognitive standpoint it is not difficult to understand why in front and in back might be difficult for young children. We have said that one vertical plane in space relates to the space in front of us versus that behind us. The use of in front and in back referring to our own position should not be difficult. However, when we talk about the front and hack of other objects we may become confused in terms of the spatial relation between ourselves and the object. If we are facing the back of a building and children are playing in a park between us and the building, we have a choice of saying that the children are playing in the park in front of us or in back of the building. Some languages (e.g., Hausa and Djerma according to Hill [1975l), use in front of and behind in the way we refer to people in a line: $z$ is in front of $y , y$ is in front of $_ { x }$ If we picture people running in a race, we see them as moving straight ahead toward the finish line. So runners closest to the finish line are in front and those further back are behind them. This use of the prepositions is just as it is in Hausa. However, in English, French, and German, when two objects ( $\scriptstyle { a }$ and $^ { b }$ are in front of us, we are likely to say that $^ { a }$ is in front of us but that $b$ is behind a ( $b$ est derriere a, $b$ ist hinter $^ { a }$ ). In Hausa, the preposition would not change ( $b$ is gaban $^ { a }$ and $\pmb { a }$ is gaban the speaker).

# Practice 10.7

1. Use Figures t0.1 and 10.2 to chart the spatial relations in another language. Compare your results to those of your classmates. How many languages actually have separate terms for each cell?   
2. H. Clark (1973) reasoned that at in the Catford chart is the least complex (and therefore easiest to acquire) spatial preposition. It is one-dimensional. The more dimensions added, the more complex the preposition becomes. Clark believes the end point column prepositions are positive and the start point ones negative. Positive items are usually easier to acquire than, negative items, so prepositions

in column 2 should be easier than those in column 3. The further the preposition is from at on the chart, the more difficult it should be. Do you have evidence from ESL or EFL leamers to support this prediction about difficulty?

3. This E\$L exercise uses prepositions that relate to time rather than space. Complete the exercise. Then, in the language you used for Practice 10.7.1, check to see whether there is an overlap of prepositions for time and space as there is for English.

4. Vandeloise (1987) notes that children first say that they put things in containers and only later on and under. This article looks at the acquisition of devant/derriere and dans/sur and uses both adult and child subjects. If you teach French, you might replicate this study with your students and compare your results and interpretation to those of Vandeloise.

5. Do you think that in and under are semantically clear? If you took an object and placed a bowl (face down) over it, would you say that the object is in or under the bowl? If instead of an object, you blew in smoke or some gas, would you say that the smoke is in or under the bowl? If you sit down at your table and stretch out your legs, are they in or under the table? If you are in a swimming pool, and you stretch out your legs, are they under the water or in the water? After you decide on the correct preposition, check to see if the in/on distinction works the same way in another language ot your choice.

6. Jackendoff (1978) describes prepositions in a different way. He divides them into locational prepositions (those that go with the verbs be and stay) and path prepositions (those that are used with motion verbs like go). Location prepositions include on, under, beside, near, and path prepositions include to, from, toward, around. The path prepositions can also show extent as in from . . . to combinations. Prepositions can also show orientation as in point toward or away from. Would this analysis be more useful than Catford's or Lakoff's? Give examples to justify your answer.   
7. English uses in front of and in back of in two ways. In the first, the object to be located may be in front or in back of another object. For example, if we left a book on the floor in front ot a chair or dropped it behind the chair, the chair serves as a reference point for locating the book. It's in front ot or in back of the chair. However, imagine you set the book on the floor at the side of the chair while you went to get a pencil. If you look at the chair from the side, the book is there in front of you. This ambiguity occurs in many languages. In Spanish, delante and detras works the same way. List the words for in front and in back in as many other languages as you can. Are they also ambiguous?

# Articles and demonstratives

It is not difficult to sympathize with Zoila when she responds as follows to a question about why she doesn't learn function words - conjunctions, prepositions, pronouns, and articles:

Zoila: I never using this little, little words.   
Rina: Like what?   
Zoila: "Ah," "an" "and" "that" "/em/" "/ipidit/" y'know? "If," /bin/, /it/ sometimes xxx (inaudible). Well, maybe because I no study . never . . . an' only hear the people and . . . and talking.   
Rina: Yeah, but people talk with these words.   
Zoila: Yeah, pero /es, eh/ I'm hear and put more attention the big words. You know and . . . something \*house." I know "house" is the "casa" for me. And /es es/ and little words is no too important for me.

We know that articles $( a , a n , \ t h e )$ and demonstratives (this, that) are important because they help us to point out objects, to bring them to the attention of our listeners. It is not surprising, then, that they develop quite early in child language. In the naming game, mothers point to objects and say, "What's this?" "What's that?" The child may or may not respond with the appropriate word and the mother continues, "That's a car. It's a car." Later the child directs the adult's attention to objects in the same way "That (pointing) car." (It is also one of the earliest pronouns used by young children.) For young children, these early demonstratives probably mean something like "notice." (It's not entirely clear whether they also use oh-oh for this same function or whether oh-oh is a vocative, a call for attention to self rather than a call to attend to an object pointed out by the child.)

We find this same naming game in data of children learning second languages. Paul, a 5-year-old Chinese child learning English, (Huang and Hatch, 1978) used vocatives and demonstratives in this same way as he elicited names for objects.

I. Vocative and demonstrative Paul: Oh-oh! Jim:What? Paul: This (points to ant) Jim: It's an ant.   
2. Demonstrative Paul: this (pointing) Jim: A pencil. Paul: (echo) pencil this+++pencil (falling intonation on each word)

Notice that the child produces this/that in these utterances but not a/the. In child language, demonstratives appear before articles, and this seems to be the case for this child second language learner as well. Articles appear in language of young children, usually by the end of the third year. However, it is not clear that young children make the same distinctions between this and that or between a and the as adults. Aduits usually use the definite article the when they can assume that the listener should already have the noun in mind. (In language classes, we tell students to use the indefinite a on first mention and the thereafter. That's a good heuristic, but it's not quite that simple!) Adults make a distinction between what is close (physically or emotionally) and what is distant in selecting between this and that. Young children may use demonstratives and articles but they do not necessarily draw these distinctions.

The English article system is difficult for students from many other language backgrounds. It is, however, a special problem for students from Asian languages that do not have such articles. International students who have problems with English definite and indefinite articles often use demonstratives or quantifiers instead as shown in parts of this paragraph written by a Vietnamese student:

Haagen Daazs ice cream has unique and special characterister. That is design of this package. Therefore, in spite of high process of this cost, the sales of it shows to increase of $2 5 \%$ every year.

{Data source: V. Wenzell)

Quantifiers (e.g., some, axy, one, ten) serve many of the same functions as demonstratives and so students sometimes use these to get around the problem of article choice, as in this exam sample written by a Korean ESL student:

I will choice Job B because Job A doesn't have much salary and has too much vacation. If vacation has much time, it usually spend money too much. And Job C has high salary but hasn't much vacation. If I work too hard, I have to rest much too. I like going to vacation. If I took much vacation 6 weeks, I would hate to work. So, I decide Job B.

(Data source: B. Lynch)

Many languages do not mark nouns with articles, and some languages that use demonstratives as the predominant way of pointing out nouns. And there are languages that have only one article. In other languages, definite nouns are not marked but indefinite nouns may require a special articlelike marker.

When we look at how well second language learners acquire articles, for accuracy it is important that we look at each form and its function in both the first and second languages. (Unfortunately, many research projects lump them together under "article.") Huebner (1979), for example found thar Ge, a Laotian learner of English, used da (the) to mark nouns as specific and known to the hearer in some cases and not in others. In many studies this information would be listed as a percent correct figure for articles. However, with a closer examination, Huebner showed that da was used least frequently in suhject position. For example,

chainis tertii-tertii fai. bat jaepanii isa twentii eit.   
(The) Chinese (man is) 3s. But (the) Japanese is 28.

Why should Ge not use da for nouns that appear to be subjects? The explanation Huebner offers is that Ge's English, like his native language, is topic-prominent, and that topics most frequently fall in subject position. Topics typically show old information, known to the hearer. In other positions Ge used da more frequently to mark nouns as definite and known.

>gow howm, isa plei da gerl.   
(When we) went home, (we would visit) the girls.

Thus a contrastive analysis of errors and a functional analysis as well is most useful in understanding the emerging article system in second or foreign language learning.

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

For English speakers, acquisition of languages with grammatical gen. der is perhaps just as difficult. Learners have the additional task of marking articles according to the gender of the referent, not an easy task. Eva, the 6-year-old Hungarian child acquiring French (Kenyeres and Kenyeres, 1938) was both fascinated and frustrated by grammatical gender (see Chapter 1).

Karmiloff-Smith (1979) has shown that acquisition of gender is not an easy process even for French children. She says that young children do not appear to attend to natural gender of ohjects but rather to the sound characteristics of the words. Young L2 Spanish learners also seem to attend to phonological characteristics in selecting articles, even though they have not been taught to do so:

# Example A

Adult: Tu me dijiste que estas son las ventanas de los dos casas.' ;Esta bien decir \*los dos casas? (You told me that these are the windows of the two houses. Is it correct to say los dos houses?)

Child: Estos son los, es . . . estos, oh estas son las ventanas dec ylos-las dos casas? (Those are the, th . . . thosc, oh those are the windows of losIas dos houses?)

Adult: Muy bien. $\vdots \Upsilon$ por que tenemos que decir las? (Very good. And why do we have to say las?)

Child: Porque 'casa' termina con ${ \bf { \dot { a } } } ^ { \prime } { \bf { y } } ,$ Innm, tiene, es 'la casa.' (Because house ends with an 'a' and, mmm, has, is 'la house'.) Adult: Uhhuh.

Child: And (heh-heh) y casa, luego las con 's,' es las. {And [laugh] and house, then las with an $\bullet _ { \mathbf { S } ^ { \prime } }$ is las.

# Example B

Adult: Aqui dices la manzana cayo' pero aqui dices \*\* los manzanas.' ;Cual es correcto? {Here you say la apple fell, but here you say los apples. Which is correct?)   
Child: Las

Adult: Uhhuh. ${ \mathfrak { i } } ^ { \mathbf { Y } }$ por que las? (Uhhuh. And why las?)

Child: Porque manzanas termina en a. Yo, yo hizo este porque estaba escribiendo rapido porque Joana no lla-lla-me llamo una uh slow poke. (Because apples ends in a. I, I did that because I was writing fast because Joana didn't ca- ca- called me a uh slow poke.) (Data source: S. Plann)

In each case, the child gives a "rule" that if a noun ends with an $^ { - \alpha }$ , the article must be la (or las if the noun is plural).

Perhaps one of the reasons that adults have so much difficulty with gender in the second languages they use is that they are not quite so attuned to what sounds like a masculine or feminine word.

# Practice 10.8

1. Researchers have shown that young children can distinguish between a and the (in tests where they manipulate toys to act out a story line) even when they do not make the distinction in their talk. Some specialists say that children do not make the distinction in their talk because children are egocentric and so do not take the listener's knowledge into account. That is, the child will use a if she has just become aware of the object and not to show that the tistener should bring the object to mind. (For example, the child might start a story with \*The girl wants the cone," rather than "A girl wants a cone." Do you agree with this explanation? why or why not? If you work with young children, you might want to test this with a picture book story.

2. Notice that Zoila used some articles in talking about the "little words" that were not important for her. How might you explain this?

3. Check the article use of your students. Categorize where and when articles are omitted or misused. What patterns do you see? Compare your findings with those of your classmates. What similarities or differences do you find? Can the differences be attributed to the age of the Iearners, their first languages, or to other causes?

4. Here are excerpts from two entrance examinations. Compare the articles in the compositions. Can you account for similarities and differences between your data in item 3 and these examples?

# Chinese L1

Of three jobs offered, Job A has a leastest salary paid, hours of work, but has the most vacation and a higest job satisfaction. Which job is suitable varies from different point of view. I will accept job C. Compared with the job A and B, job C has a four times of salary paid as job A and as two and a half times of salary as a job B's --

5. If your students use demonstratives or quantifiers in place of articles, interview them to determine whether or not this is a conscious avoidance of articles. Review articles and books on the teaching of English articles. Do they mention demonstratives and quantifiers as possible substitutes for articles?   
6. Public messages and notices often use nouns without articles. For example, envelopes often have the message "Place stamp here. Post office will not deliver without postage." Collect examples (or have your students collect examples) of messages without articles. Do you or your students feel that such input makes learning of the English article system even more difficult?   
7. If you teach or are studying a language which nas grammatical gender, collect examples that show the ease or difficulty with which learners produce correct articles.

In this chapter we have reviewed the basic classification of words in terms of parts of speech. We began with those that carry the most content: nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. In some sources, you will find these called lexical or content words. Other words carry syntactic information and these are often called grammatical or function words. For Zoila, these are the "little words."

In the discussion of each word class we clamed that word class is determined by use. This leads to confusion in classification. Should we assign functional labels or class labels to words? Should we separate the word can into four different words: a noun, an adjective, a verb, and a modal? Should we separate the word dancing into two words, a verb form and a noun gerund? We can lahel each of these as separate nouns, verbs, adjectives, and so forth, or we can claim that some verbs can "serve as" nouns, some adjectives can "serve as" nouns. This second treatment (considering the functions for which we use words rather than any "inherent" word class) makes far greater sense especially when we move from separate words to lexical phrases.

In the discussion of conjunctions, it was difficult to limit examples to one-word conjunctions. For example is a very common lexical phrase connector that we cannot write as one word, but which functions like a one-word connector. We can, in fact, use many lexical phrases as if they were examples of nouns, verbs, adverbs, and so forth. Ofis a preposition, "of the drought" is a prepositional phrase, but "because of the drought" is an adverbial phrase in the sentence "We had to conserve water because of the drought." In the same sentence, "had to conserve" is a verbal. "Had to conserve water" is a verb phrase. "Having to conserve" is a nominal, and \*having to conserve water" is a noun phrase in the sentence \*Having to conserve water is no fun." When we make such changes, we often change the designation to nominal or noun phrase, to verbal or verb phrase, to adjectival or adjective phrase, adverbial or adverbial phrase, and so forth. In each case, we have shifted from a word class to a word function label.

![](img/b036c8b13c0766660d4c4614f030fb73090fb058baa3f7559c487ffd06b1bb3a.jpg)  
Figure 10.3 Summary of word classes (from Halliday, 1985, p. 91; used with permission}

Although it is possible to divide the traditional parts of speech into the major categories of content vs. function words, it is also possible to group them according to their three major use groups: nominals, verbals, and adverbials. Halliday (1985) displays this division in Figure 10.3. We can classify words according to the roles we give them in our talk and in our writing; however, we can rearrange words in many ways, into different groupings and, by doing so, change their roles. When we do this, we have not really changed the word but rather made it serve different purposes. The roles we assign to some words are very flexible (we can sun ourselves in the sun) while others are not. We cannot easily use prepositions as nouns except as citations (e.g., "I said at"). It is, perhaps, on the basis of

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

frequency of use for different functions that a word becomes known as a noun, a verb, an adverb, an adjective, or some other part of speech.

# Research and application

Nouns, pronouns, and articles

1. Several of the readings in Berko-Gleason (1993) make claims about the acquisition of subtypes of word classes. For example, Pease et al. discuss the notion of nouns of change or nouns that the child can manipulate being learned before those that are more static. They and other authors in the book talk about the acquisition of deictic terms (pointing terms such as "this'" or "that"). They also note that words that refer to the here and now develop before those that are not present in the child's environment (the concurrent and present versus nonconcurrent and nonpresent dichotomy). If you wish to study child language development, read and critique a selection of articles in this book as the basis for your own research project.

2. Koike (1983) lists the rank order of acquisition of pronouns by three Japanese children who lived in the United States.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Rank 1</td><td>Pronoun 1</td><td>Sachiko (5 yrs) 2</td><td>Jun (7&#x27;/2 yrs) 1.5</td><td>Nobi (11 yrs) 1</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>you (sg)</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>this (sub)</td><td>7.5</td><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>we</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>my</td><td>2</td><td>1.5</td><td>5.5</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>that (sub)</td><td>10</td><td>6</td><td>5.5</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>he</td><td>10</td><td>8</td><td>9.5</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>she</td><td>5</td><td>9</td><td>7.5</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>this (det)</td><td>7.5</td><td>10</td><td>9</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>you (sg ob)</td><td>10</td><td>11.5</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>it (sub)</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>11.5</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>me</td><td>12</td><td>11.5</td><td>11.5</td></tr></table></body></html>

Koike performed Spearman rank-order correlations between each pair of children. The correlation in the order in which pronouns were acquired for Sachiko and Nobi was .61, for Sachiko and Jun, .78, and for Jun and Nobi, .84. Since the Ll for all three children was the same, why do you suppose the correlations were not higlier? How does the order compare with Miller and Ervin-Tripp (1964) and Chiat's (1986) orders? You might want to read these studies as preparation for planning your own research on the acquisition of pronouns.

3. Hirakawa (1990), in a study of reflexive pronouns, tested the predictions of Universal Gramnar. Grade 10, 11, 12, 13 Japanese studying English in high school were asked to identify the referent of the reflexive pronoun in five different types of sentences:

Type A (two-clause tensed sentence): John said that Bill hurt himself.   
Type $\pmb { B }$ (three-clause tensed sentence): Ted knows that John said that Bill hurt himself.   
Type C (two-clause infinitival sentence): John told Bill not to hurt himself.   
Type $\pmb { D }$ (three-clause infinitival sentence): Ted thinks that John wants Bill to understand himself.   
Type $\pmb { \varepsilon }$ (one-clause subject-object sentence): Tom showed Bill a picture of himself.

The test included five multiple-choice items for each type. The choices for answers were the names of the three people John, Bill, Ted), someone else, or don't know. The means are higher for Type A and B than for C and D. Otherwise, there were no real differences across types of sentences (or proficiency levels) and so the results did not support the predictions of Universal Grammar. Read the study, critique the procedure, and then design a replication witl students from another language group.

4. Tanz (1980) looked at identity and quantity in quantifiers and pronouns. She had children, aged 3 to 5, respond to such stimuli as follows.

Identity: Make one of the pigs go in the house. Now make (a) it (b) one go in the truck. (Materials: 2 pigs, 2 chickens, house, truck)   
Quantity: There is chocolate on the table. Give (a) it to me; (b) give me some.   
Identity, plural: Drive two cars to the house. Now drive (a) them, (b) two to the edge of the cliff.   
Quantity, plural: There are fiowers on the table. Give (a) them to me; (b) me some.

You might replicate the procedure with bilingual children or use the task with both adult and child learners. How appropriate is the task across age groups? What results did you obtain with this pilot study? How might you revise the task for a study that would look at a large number of pronouns, quantifiers, articles, and demonstratives?

5. Pocheptsov (1992) notes that Russian rjad and neskolko are both translated as "more than two" yet found that speakers select

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

neskoiko for three to four and five to six items and rjad for five to six to nine to ten items. He notes that we often select number terms which seem equivalent (e.g., minutes rather than hours. days rather than years and fractions rather than percentages) because they somehow sound like more, although they are really equivalent. According to Pocheptsov, we also rcund off numbers (e.g., "More than ten people died in the accident") as a way of "distorting facts while telling the truth." Prepare a research plan to investigate speaker preference in the use of such quantifiers as some, several, more than or for numerically equivalent forms (fractions vs. percentages). Do your findings support Pocheptsov's interpretations?

# Adjectives and adjective agreement

6. In gendered languages, learners use gender in articles and in ad. jectives and must pay attention to whether the noun they are referring to is singular or plural. Early studies used longitudinal data to study the acquisition of gender agreement (see De Houwer [1987] on the acquisition of agreement for gender in the language of a bilingual Dutch and English child). Plann (1976) used a puzzle task as one of several methods of testing gender acquisition in Spanish as : second language. The puzzle pieces showed familiar objects in various colors. There were twenty-four pieces, twelve masculine and twelve feminine. Half of the puzzle pieces showed singular ob jects and half showed groups ofobjects. The child, given a puzle frame that showed the completed picture, asked the holder of the puzzle pieces for those shown in the frame. For example, the cluild had to ask for the yellow dogs (Quiero Ios perros amarillos), the orange turtle (Quiero la tortuga anaranjada), and so forth. At all age levels, Plann found greater accuracy for masculine than for feminine forms and higher accuracy for singular than plural forms. What explanation can you give for these findings? Design a task that you might use with adult learners of a language marked for gender. Justify the appropriateness of the task and ofthe vocabulary that you selected for the task.   
7. Magnan (1983) noted that gender errors are common in language learner speech. The question is how much importance to attach to such errors. Do they really irritate or bother the native histener? Magnan found that previous studies claimed learners' errors in gender are among the least irritating for Spanish and German native speskers. Judges listened to taped sentences which contained various types of errors (definite article, adjective agreement, prepositions between verb and infinitive, verb

morphology, clitic pronoun). The 352 judges were divided into categories by age. Adults were more forgiving of gender errors than were lycee (high school) students and lycee students also judged such errors less irritating than did C.E.S (middle school) students. For all three groups, errors involving the wrong gender with a person were judged to be more irritating than error of wrong gender with an object. (The chart on Magnan's p. 204 ranks the fifteen error types for the three groups, and gender er. rors are near the bottom except for le soeur, which is ranked fourth by CES students, eighth by lycee students, and twelfth by adults.) Why do you think that younger listeners are more critical of gender errors than are adults? If you teach French (or another language which marks gender) and your students plan to interact with young adolescents, low much emphasis would you put on gender errors?

8. Translation of poems and stories can be difficult wlen languages mark nouns for grammatical gender. For example, the word for grasshopper in French is feminine. The Russian word is masculine. So, typically, thie French word for grasshopper is translated as the feminine dragonfly in Russian. The word for fir tree in German is masculine and that for a palm tree is femiine. Fir trees are feminine in Russian so, in translation of poems, the fir tree is changed to a cedar which is masculine. Why would translators bother to change the word? Isn't it more important that readers correctly identify the actual insect or tree? If you do translations across languages with gender, share your own examples of problem areas you have encountered. How did you decide whether or not to change the word?

# Adverbs

9. Vendler (1984) described five types of action adverbs. These include event adverbs (e.g., "he rang the bell loudly," "he pulled the rope tight"), manner adverbs (e.g., "he danced gracefully"), a third group that include facility (e.g., "he solved the puzzle easily"), moral (e.g., "he spilled the tea accidentally"), and timing (e.g., "he answered quickly") adverbs, sentence adverbs (e.g., "stupidly he answered the question'), and illocutionary adverbs (e.g., "honestly, he never answered my letter"). If you teach a writing course for international shdents or second language learners, check to see which types of adverbs they use. If they use none or ouly a few of these, you might design a teaching unit and test to see whether an emphasis on type of adverb increases appropriate use of adverbs in their compositions.

# Conjunctions

10. To investigate the emergence of connectors in second or foreign language learning, you might first review Ll studies. In addition to Bloom et al., look at Wells (1985) and Clancy et al. (1976) for comparisons across Turkish, German, Italian, and English. TagerFlusberg et al. (1982) look at the types of coordination used by Japanese and by English speaking children. How would you design your own study?

# Prepositions

11. Krzeszowski (1990) asked twenty-five Polish advanced learners of English to transiate into Polish twenty senses of the preposition over The cognitive descriptions and visual relations were based on Brugman's (1981) analysis and include relations such as those needed for "He jumped over the wall," "They jumped over the cliff,""The wall fell over," "He turned over the pages,""He rolled the log over," "The lelicopter hovered over the town," "The power line stretches over my yard," "She spread the tablecloth over the table," "Guards are posted all over the hill," and others. Krzeszowski found that the most prototypic uses were consistently translated as nad/ponad in Polish and that there was much less agreement on translation as the uses became less prototypic. Plan a replication project using the same materials with another language. What predictions do you make regarding the outcome?

12. Morsbach (1981) administered a comprehension test of fifteen grammatical structures to sixty Japanese (aged 11-13 years) and thirty-one German (10-13 years) students living in London. As they listened to test sentences, the students selected the best picture for the sentence from a group of four pictures. Error rates were fairly high for pictures illustrating prepositions:

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Incorrect answers</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Japanese Ss</td><td>German Ss</td></tr><tr><td>by</td><td>54</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>over</td><td>9</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>behind</td><td>1</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>along</td><td>0</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>up</td><td>1</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>out</td><td>6</td><td>8</td></tr><tr><td>down</td><td>24</td><td>0</td></tr></table></body></html>

Look at the pictures used in teaching materials to show location. Do you think that the problem might be, as Morsbach points out for the preposition by, that the differences among the prepositions are ambiguous (e.g., "The horse is [by, in front of, behind] the tree')? Design a set of pictures that you think might be used to teach or test the distinctions among these prepositions. Limit the use to locatives. (Can you think of any explanation for the different error rate for down in the two groups of students?)

13. Kalisz (l990) examined the dimension in front of and behind in English and Pohish and also discussed the metaphorical extensions of these terms. If you are studying or teach languages which reflect a different perception of space in ways similar to the Hausa example mentioned in the section on prepositions in this chapter, read Kalisz's treatment of this phenomenon and write a short report comparing these languages. How difficult do you think these different perspectives on space might be for second language learners?

. Weber-Olsen and Ruder (1980) studied American 5-year-olds and adults as they learned to label spatial relationships using four Japanese locatives that coincide or partially overlap with into, onto, out of, and off. Adults learned the Japanese lexicon faster and better than the 5-year-olds. Interference initially accounted for many of the adults' errors. freru and oku are similar to into and onto and denote containment and support, respectively. However, ireru is used ouly to describe objects contained but not physically joined to a container (e.g., an apple in a bowl) whereas oku is used ouly when the object has superficial contact with the reference point or support surface (e.g.. putting a ring on the palm of the hand or a pen on a table). Hameru is used when objects are put in a tightly fitting relationship or in their normative state (e.g., putting a ring on a finger, putting a cap on a pen, putting a puzzle piece into a puzzle, screwing a bulb into a socket). Finally, toru hiterally means to take away with the hand. The related form toridasu refers to taking out with the hand but ouly when the walls of a container are deep enough to encompass the object (e.g., out of cans, bottles, deep boxes but not from shallow saucers or ashtrays). The authors suggest that hameru, and foru would be more difficult for English speakers than ireru, and oku. The authors provide the following diagrams for toru and hameru.

toru ("away") hameru off out join fasten put in(to) put on(to)

Remember that put in(to) refers to containment with physical proximity to the container while put on(to) refers to nonhorizontal

support. Read the study and admire the training and testing procedure. In this study, object manipulation worked well with both adults and children. Redraw the diagrams using Stockwell, Bowen, and Martin's (1965) correspondence categories. Replicate the study with a group of your classmates.

# Morphology and derivations

In Chapters 8 and 9 we discussed some of the lexical processes used to create new words - creating lexical phrases, coining new words, and borrowing and conversing. In these chapters we talked about words. In this chapter we will look at the ways we change words by adding morphology. To do this we will look at morphemes, the smallest meaningful units used in word building

# Identifying morphemes

A morpheme is, by definition, a meaningful linguistic unit that contains no smaller meaningful units. This minimum form is called a morpheme, the meaning of the unit is called a sememe. The word cats, for example, contains two morphemes: the lexical morpheme cat and the grammatical morpheme $\pmb { S } _ { \pmb { \nu } }$ which means plural.

Because morphemes have meanings, we expect that they can be defined. That is, the recurring form -er of farmer, dancer, singer means "one whon -- no more, no less. The letters e and r of the word ever cannot be divided from the word and assigned this meaning. Ever is a single morpheme.

A morpheme must be internally consistent in form and meaning, which can make morpheme identification difficult. For example, -ess is a morpheme which means "feminine one who." Thus, the morpheme -ess holds two meanings within it, but it may connote even more. Consider the masculine-feminine pairs in the following lisr:

governor governess major majorette patron matron landlord landlady wizard witch master mistress

In these word pairs, the difference is much more than just $( + 1 -$ feminine). The change also shows a shift in level of power and seriousness traditionally assigned to the role.

Sometimes morphemes have more than one pronunciation, but the meaning of these variants does not change. For example, the plural $\pmb { S }$ has three different pronunciations shown in the words birds, breezes, and beets. Even though the sound of the morpheme changes somewhat, it is still the same morpheme, and all three variants mean plural.

Two different morphemes may have the same shape. For example, when the -s of verbs (learns, dances, skips) occurs on third person singular verbs, marking them for present tense, the meaning is present tense, third person singular. The morphemes for plural and for third person singular present tense have the same form but they are separate morphemes because each has its own meaning.

It is not always possible to identify morphemes in words correctly unless we know something of etymology. For example, you might think that hamburger consists of three morphemes: ham (perhaps they were once made with ham), burg (maybe it has something to do with a small town), and er (maybe this is an -er that identifies a person, something like a burgher). So, hamburger might derive from something like ham that is prepared or eaten by a middle-class businessperson from a small city. If you look up hamburger in the dictionary, however, you will find that it refers to a sandwich first made in the city of Hamburg, Germany. It has nothing to do with ham.

We have said that the form must recur with the same meaning in order for it to qualify as a morpheme. Many morphemes have come to us from Latin and we may be unaware of their meanings. Few people stop to think of the origin of the morpheme -voc- in vocation, provoke, vocabu. lary, vociferous, revoke, irrevocable, and vocalize. Language textbooks, however, often have special exercises with Latin-based morphemes. High school science textbooks and basic medical, pharmacology, and science college texts also include such exercises. The question for our analysis, though, is whether we should consider examples like -voc- as separate morphemes or simply consider them part of the word stem.

Another difficulty in identifying the form of a morpheme has to do with its regularity. It is not difficult to identify the plural morpheme -s, and we can draw a slash to demarcate the morphemes in boat/s, bike/s, canoe/s. When the spelling is irregular (copies) we can arbitrarily place a slash before the $^ { - s }$ (copie/s) or we can rewrite the word as $\boldsymbol { c o p y } + \boldsymbol { s }$ to show the morpheme break. If there is no change in the word, we can rewrite the word with a zero $( 0 )$ plural morpheme $\{ s h e e p + \theta$ for plural). These problems are easily solved. However, what if the plural is not an $- s$ as in mice? In most cases, phonological rules describe groups of irregular plurals. (For our identification exercises, rewrite the item as mi $z e = t w o$ morphemes, mouse $^ +$ plural. If you were asked to do a serious linguistic description, you would, of course, change everything to phonetic script and write the phonological rules for the required changes.)

# Practice 11.1

1. In each of the following sets, identify and define the shared morpheme. Using modern-day English as your guide, discard those examples which do not fit the shared meaning.

a. unfair unwise fun unable United Nations   
b. disability dismantle displeasure distance   
c. dryness Loch Ness quickness brightness   
d. songs boys apples follows   
e. worker teacher mother paper   
f. actor lever dreamer refer   
g. mailman chairman woman tineman

2. Identity and give the meaning of two morphemes in each of the following words: dad's, teacher, walked, came, said, mailbox, untie, illness, running, repay, proudly, shapely, uniform, cattle.

3. What is the relation between a morpheme and a sound, a morpheme and a word, a morpheme and a syllable? List two morphemes that are also sounds, two that are also syllables, and two that are words.

4. What are the three vaniants in pronunciation ot the past tense morpheme -ed in this list of words? What causes the change in the shape ot the -ed morpheme?

walked attached danced wished hugged lived raised judged landed boated righted loaded

5. The words in each ot the following lists contain two or three morphemes. The meanings of the morphemes within each set, however, are not the same. What does each one mean?

cats (noun) dogs (noun) horses (noun) cat's dog's horse's cats' dogs' horses' cats (verb) dogs (verb) horses (verb)

Ail three can be used as verbs ("she cats around." he dogged my every step," "they were horsing around"), though these are metaphorical extensions.

mono-, peri-, pres-, proto-, supra-, ante-, demi-, di-, hypoma!-, meta-, poly-, retro-, -al, -ance, -ant, -ate, -ic, -ine, -itis, -ery. Check your course materials to see whether these particular affixes are included. Justify your belief that such affixes should or should not be taught in your particular program. Are these same affixes ever used to form scientific words in another language you know? If so, are the shared forms usually the prefixes rather than the suffixes? Why might this be so? Is it more important to teach the prefixes than the suffixes? Or should more importance be given to the meanings of the affixes regardless of position?

# Classifying morphemes

Morphemes vary in kind and function. We can classify morphemes into several general categories: bound versus free, derivational versus inflectional, and lexical versus grammatical. Though the terms are given as clear dichotomies, there is (as always) a lot of grey area. It might be more realistic to taik about a given morpheme as being more lexical than grammatical or more lexical than another morpheme. For the sake of discussion, though, we will define each label according to its characteristics.

# Bound versus free morphemes

This is the easiest distinction to define because it relates closely to English orthography. Morphemes are free to occur as individual words, or they may be bound, in which case they are always attached to another morpheme. If you divide the word indemnity into morphemes, you will find that each morpheme is bound. None of the morpheme units can stand alone. If we do the same with the word nevertheless, we find that each morpheme can stand alone; they are all free.

The free or bound quality has nothing to do with semantic meanings. For example, the same semantic meaning might be expressed in separate words or morphemes in one language and bound morphemes in another. Compare the Italian and English counterparts:

fresco cool   
freschetto coolish   
freschettino rather coolish   
freschino sort of cool (more colloquial form)   
casa house   
casetta little house

Languages that use bound morphemes extensively are sometimes cailed agglutinative. For example, the language Kannada (as described by Aronoff $\&$ Sridhar, 1984) has number and case morphemes bound to nouns and uses multiple modification with morphemes, as in

huduga-r-bbar-ig-oskara-vagi-yu boy-pl-two-dat-goal-purposive-inclusive (for the two boys, too)

Other languages, such as Chinese, are called isolating systems because the morphemes are all potentially free and the only morphological process is compounding.

There is a general principle in child language development that free forms are acquired before bound morphemes. For children learning English, this predicts that not is acquired before -n't, will before -'ll, would before -d, have, has, and had before their contracted forms, and full forms of be (am, is, are, was, were) before the contracted forms. Bellugi (1967) noted that even though mothers use the contracted form of will much more than the full form, children first use only the free form. L1 researchers admit that children produce don't and can't early, but argue that these appear only in unanalyzed chunks or memorized pbrases. They are, therefore, counted as monomorphemic, free forms. Wode (1977) reports that German children use full free forms before their contracted forms. He also believes that early contracted forms, such as wo's and da's (as in the child utterance wo's ist er for "where is he"), are monomorphemic.

# Derivational versus inflectional morphemes

Bcfore discussing derivational and inflectional types of morphemes in greater derail, we will focus on the basic difference between the two categories.

Derivationai morphemes make explicit the word class assignment of the word. Thus, they change the underlying form of the word to make it into an adjective, an adverb, or another part of speech. For example, $- f u l$ is a norpheme that changes nouns into adjectives (beauty becomes beau$t i f u l j , \dot { - t } \dot { f } y$ is an affix that changes nouns to verbs (beauty becomes beau$t i f y )$ , and $- l y$ is an affix that changes adjectives to adverbs (beautifu) becomes beautifully).

Inflectional morphemes, in contrast, indicate the syntactic relation between words and function as grammatical markers. So, plural morphemes are inflectional morphemes that apply to all nouns, and the plural plays a syntactic role in terms of verb agreement. The third person singuIar present tense morpheme applies to all verbs and plays a syntactic role. The comparative morpheme -er applies to many adjectives and adverbs and has a syntactic role. All of these are inflectional morphemes. Because they apply to most of the members of a class of words, inflections are much more productive than derivations.

Language Files (Ohio State University, 1982, pp. 50-52) summarizes the differences berween inflectional and derivational morphemes as follows:

vs. Derivational Changes meaning or part of speech of the stem. Typically indicates semantic reJations within the word.

Inflectional   
1. Does not change meaning or part of speech of stem.   
2. Typically indicates syntactic or semantic relations between different words in a sentence.   
3. Typically occurs with all members of some large class of morphemes.   
4. Typically occurs at margins of words.

Typically occurs with only some members of a class of morphemes. Typically occurs before any inflectional suffixes are added.

# Lexical versus grammatical morphemes

Affixes divide neatly into two categories: derivational affixes which are more lexical in nature since they allow us to form new lexical entities, and inflectional affixes which are more grammatical in nature because they are used to show syntactic relations.

Free morphemes, however, can also be divided according to whether they carry primarily lexical or grammatical meanings. Single words like prepositions, articles, relative pronouns, are free morphemes that serve grammatical functions, just like the -ing or -s verb affixes (see Chapter 10). Thus, function words, along with inflectional morphemes, are grammatical morphemes. Table 11.1 may clarify this explanation.

# Practice 11.2

1. Divide the following words into morphemes and identity each morpheme as free or bound, derivational or inflec. tionat, lexical or grammatical.

toothbrush debug between impish daylight repetition closely receive over

2. Provide an example of your own where a morpheme may be free in one language (e.g., littie in English) but a bound affix in another (e.g., -ito in Spanish).

3. Justify your choice in the following sentence: "Derivational morphemes are (always/sometimes/never) bound."

4. Which do you think that it would be easier to learn, an isotating language or an agglutinative language? What other characteristics of such languages might intluence your answer? Given that Chinese languages are said to be isolating, do you think that speakers ot these languages would have particular difficulty acquiring English morphology? Justify your answer.

5. Consider Table 11.1 from a curriculum standpoint. Select one type of language class (e.g., beginning grammar, ESP-science class, beginning literature class, translation class, conversation class) and estimate the importance that would be given to each area of the chart. Try to assign what proportion of class time should be spent on each area. Compare your estimates with those of your classmates. How do you account for the similarities and differences?

# Derivations

In previous chapters, we have discussed many ways of creating new words from old. We can also build new words by adding derivational affixes, which do not apply regularly to an entire class of words, but only to some subset. In English, derivational morphemes are mainly prefixes and suffixes. These affixes often change the part of speech of the new, derived word from that of the stem. The affixes thereby help us to identify relationships within words. In the remainder of this chapter, we will look at how affixes produce new but derived (related) words. In Chapter 12, we will look at inflectional affixes and how they connect words within sentences.

In some languages, derivational morphology is highly regular and pro. ductive. Polish and Esperanto are two such languages. For example, the Esperanto word bono means good and bona means goodness. The endings -o and -4 are always attached to the word base to change it to a noun and a verb. The system is completely regular.

English is quite different in this regard. In English, some derivational affixes are very productive and some are not. We know that -ly is an affix that changes adjectives to adverbs (slow-slowly, tender-tenderly). It is a highly productive affix. Yet it cannot be used with every adjective (\*tall-- tally, talented-talentedly). We want our students to learn to use the most productive affixes, but we also want them to learn when they can and cannot be used, which is not an easy task. Some morphemes have a very Iimited range. For example, the affix -ese is not especially productive. We use it for special language registers such as teacherese or TESLese. Notice that this particular affix does not change the part of speech: teacher and teacherese are both nouns. Rather, it changes the lexical meaning of the word. Whereas a teacher is one who teaches, teacherese is the classroom register of reacher talk.

Morphemes go in and out of fashion. They may be quite productive for awhile and then virtually disappear. The -ette morpheme came into popularity with the word suffragette in the early 1900s (probably borrowed from French -et). It was still fairly popular in the 1950s with usherette and the addition of nymphette. By the 1980s, it had practically disappeared, although examples still pop up. On RAGBRAI (a bicycle trek across Iowa), riders stopping in a small town were served lunch by the Fire-ettes (wives of firemen). The affix -arama (as in motorama) was very popular in the 1950s and then virtually disappeared. Yet a campus newspaper announced that the students were having a voterama. Our supermarket advertised a cake-arama (cakes were on special) and a restaurant reviewer talked about a "full-service yupperama - a patisserie/ charcuterie, bistro/boulangerie, take-out, eat-in, expresso/wine bar , lunch and dinner place where cases display quiches, tartes, tortes, cerviche, and designer olive oil" (Los Angeles Times, October 17, 1986).

Other derivational affixes seem more lasting and productive. The affix -able is a case in point. It appears to be expanding its range (workable, portable, thinkable, and doable). Others have always been widely used and continue so. The -ly adverb affix has a very wide scope and changes many adjectives to adverbs (happily, carefully). It is so productive that we often apply it to words where it may not sound quite right. A friend, listening to a newscast, exclaimed, "He said that very nastily."

There may be as many as four or five competing affixes that appear to do the same work, but they are not interchangeable. Consider the prefixes for negation. We say unable, dishonest, intolerable, nonproductive, and amoral. All of these prefixes negate the morphemes that follow. If more than one can be used, the two resulting forms have different meanings or differcnt restrictions for word collocations. This makes their acquisition very difficult. Indeed, it has led some learners, teachers, and researchers to believe that each has to be acquired as a separate word.

Nevertheless, teachers use alternate morpheme forms in teaching spelling and in giving definitions. The student who spells summary as summery is asked to listen to the words summary and then summarize to hear the a. The student who writes histriy may be asked to listen to historical. In offering definitions, teachers may elaborate using related forms. Chaudron (1982), in his study of teachers' speech in high school classes for immigrants, gives examples of teachers' attempts to clarify meanings by changing the part of speech:

miracle . .. you have anything that was miraculous? sum up ... summarize revered . .. We refer to a minister as Reverend.

In practice, teachers and learners may use derivations to clarify the relation between the form and meaning of words.

# Practice 11.3

1. Esperanto was created to be a universal, international lan. guage. It is Latin-based and uses many items trom Romance languages. It is highly regular. Find and identify the morphemes in the following data (continues on the next page). List at least 12 morphemes and their meanings. What is the word for instructive, for well, for porter?

bono goodness instruisto teacher portistino female porter instrui to instruct pura pure bona good

malfacila difficult patro tather malbono evil facilo easiness malbone badly patrino mother facile easily porti to carry malgranda small instruistino female teacher instruo instruction tacila easy granda big malbona bad

(Source: adapted from Langacker, 1972, p. 82; used with permission)

Can you suggest a new morpheme that would allow speakers to talk about male and temale children of the family? List your new "Esperanto" words for son and daughter. How would you form the word for "big son" or "big daughter?" Did you put the adjective affix before or after the word base? why? Now decide how you would form "student" (one who receives instruction and is not a father or mother)? There are several possibilities for doing this. Explain why you decided on your particular form.

2. Superis a very productive prefix at the moment. What reasons can you give for its continued popularity? Although -teria seems to be used less and less, it stil survives. What examples can you find for -teria? What does it mean? The surviving examples of -ette seem to have something to do with marching or dancing (e.g., Rockettes, majorette, the Cougarettes, Aggiettes). Can you think of examples where this is not the case (we found bagelettes, small bagels sold at a bakery)? Do you think the meaning of these affixes is becoming more and more restricted? Do you think they may eventually disappear? Justify your reasoning.

3. The newspaper reference to yupperama presents an interesting new word to analyze. How many morphemes would you claim it has? When did yuppy become popular? Why does it end with -y? what other forms of yuppiness have you seen in print? Do you think it occurs as frequently in taik? (Listen to National Public Radio news!)

4. Notice the pretix min-. How productive is this affix? A friend of ours announced with delight that she had seen "a maxi-taxi at the mini-motel"! Are min- and max- more or less productive than micro- and macro? How do these two sets of terms differ in meaning and distribution?

5. List as many -ese examples as you can. Do you like the compound teacher talk better than teacherese? Does -ese seem somehow pejorative? Does the pejorative quality appear in all your examples or only some? Why?

# Derivational prefixes

Although derivational affixes in English are not especially regular, they still can be categorized according to their type, form, and meaning. The first major form division concerns placement: before the base (prefix) or following it (suffix). The second form distinction concerns the change in word class: nouns to verbs, verbs to adjectives, and so forth. The third has to do with the semantics of their morphology. For example, English prefixes can best be categorized according to their semantics. These include the meanings of negative (including reversible and pejorative), attitude, size or degree, locative, temporal or order, and number. There are also some prcfixes that shift meaning while changing the part of speech.

# Negatives

We have already noted that there are a varicty of negative prefixes including un-, non-, in-, a-, and dis-. All can be added to adjectives .- unimportant, nonindustrial, inescapable, amoral, displeasing - but some can also be added to nouns - nonhuman. The contrast in focus shows up in the use of more than one of the prefixes with the same word stem: inhuman, nonhuman; nonsymmetric, asymmetric. Language learners often avoid such forms in the early stages of acquisition. If they attempt to use a negative prefix, they usually supply no as in this example from a Spanish speaker: "For myself is no sufficient the sleep." Most linguistic books, however, do not include no as a negative prefix. Yet a current consumer's magazine discusses a strategy for coping with car dealers called no-haggle buying. A hardware sales catalogue lists no-heat sanders and a no-tilt shelf unit.

Some negative prefixes relate to reversibility. De-, dis,- and un- show a reversal of an action or a taking away of a quality. So, we button and unbutton clothes; we connect and disconnect the computer; fleas may jump on our pets but we soon deflea them. Marchand (1974) suggests that un- is used with everyday reversible verbs (undo) and reversible verbs derived from nouns (unzip). Dis- is used especially with verbs beginning with en-, or in- (disengage, disinfect). Marchand believes that de- is replacing dis- and is especially productive with verbs ending in -ize and -ify (declassify, demoralize). Still, where a semantic distinction exists, more than one form may be used with the same stem (unconnected, disconnected; unclassified, declassified).

When two negative affixes can be used with the same word, we have a potentia! for native speaker error. We easily confuse the following: un.

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

measurable and immeasurable; uninterested and disinterested; displace and misplace; unmoral, immoral, and amoral. In some cases, prefix errors have other causes. Lulled by the rhythm of his own phrases, President Bush responded to a question by saying he had confidence that the American people could "sort through what is fair and what is unfair, what is ugly and what is unugly" (Federal News Service, 1989). The study of slips of the tongue gives us many such delightful examples.

Algeo (1971) suggests that the negative prefix non- has pejorative (nonbook, nonevent) and neutra! (nonobedient versus disobedient) qualities and is used as a prestige marker (nonsalaried, nonprofit) and for euphemisms (nonsuccess, nonreader). Zimmer (1964), on the other hand, believes that non- is neutral rather than pejorative, whereas he finds that un- and in- are judgmental (e.g., un-American versus nonAmerican).

The pejorative category, according to Quirk and Greenbaum (1973), includes the prefixes mis-, mal-, and pseudo-. Mis-, meaning wrongly or astray, seems to be the most productive of the three. Quirk and Greenbaum show that it can be used with verbs (misinform), with abstract nouns (misconduct), and with participles (misleading). Mal- means bad(ly) and can also be used with the same types of stems: verbs (maltreat), nouns (malfunction), and participles (malfunctioning). It can also be used with adjectives (malodorous). Even though mal- can be added to one more class than mis-, it is less productive. Pseudo- has an even more restricted distribution, added to nouns and adjectives (pseudointellectual, pseudolongitudinal). It adds the meaning of false or imitation to the base word.

# Attitude

Attitude prefixes are the morphemes that convey being against, with, opposite, for, or on the side of whatever stem they are added to. A good place to look for such prefixes is in bureaucractic discourse and especially in politics. Included are the prefixes anti-, co-, counter-, and pro-. News reports supply us with examples: anti-inflation, co-conspirator, counterrevolution, pro-Gore but anti-Clinton. Of course, they can be used with nonpolitical bases as well: antibiotic, coauthor, counteract, probilingualism.

# Size and degree

Size and degree prefixes include arch-, hyper-, hypo-, maxi-, mini-, out-, over-, sub-, ultra-, and under-. Some of these are added primarily to nouns (archrival, minivan, maxisize, supermarket), others to verbs (outdo, overheat, underestimate) or adjectives (overenthusiastic, substandard, ultraposh). As you can see, some of these prefixes can be used with several parts of speech, but in each case the meanings relate to size or degree. The choice between the prefixes hypo- and byper- (e.g., hypoallergenic versus hyperallergenic) confuses even native speakers. President Bush used hypo in strange ways: "Those are two hypo-rhetorical questions" (The New York Times, 1988) and "I'm not going to hypothecate that - it may - anything goes too fast" (Muro, 1992). Hypothecate is a real word, but in this context he really meant he wouldn't predict an outcome.

# Space and time

Spatial and temporal prefixes include ex-, fore-, inter-, post-, pre-, re-, sub-, and trans-. Spatial examples include intermountain, subway, transcontinental. Temporal or order examples include forecast, preview, postgame party, reexamine, ex-teacher.

# Number

Number prefixes include bi-, di-, mono-, multi-, poly-, and tri-, as in biweekly, dichotomy, monolingual, multilingual, polyglot, and trilingual. The bi- prefix is especially confusing in publication statements. Is a biweekly paper put out twice a week or every other week? Audubon magazine states that it is published bimonthly but it is published every two months, not twice a month. Triannual reviews could be held three times a year or every third year. Bi- and tri- for other nouns are not so confusing: biathlons and triathlons are two- and three-event races held on one day.

Quirk and Greenbaum have an "other"' category that includes the prefixes auto., neo, pan-, proto-, semi-, and vice-. Their examples for these are autobiography, neo-Gothic, pan-African, prototype, semicircle, and vice-president.

Because the prefixes can be grouped into semantic classes, we would expect that they would not be difficult to teach or learn. However, the overlap of forms even within categories makes them less regular than they seem, and we can expect students to have difficulties. In some instances, students may not know the appropriate prefix. In other cases, the prefix would be correct if the base word were different. Even native speakers sometimes make errors. The negative prefixes seem to be particularly troublesome:

1. The no rich people have tamales. (Spanish L1)   
2. For myself is no sufficient the sleep. (Spanish L1)   
3. Marijuana should be illegalized. (Chinese L1)   
4. I often took myself so seriously that is unadvantageous for me to make   
friends. (Vietnamese L1)   
5. Los Angeles is overflowed by automobiles. (Korean L1)

Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

6. After finishing the paragraph and reading it again, I felt unsatisfy. (Vietnamese L1)   
7. I don't have any disillusions about it. (English L1)   
8. His writ- his works are pseudo-right scientifically. (English L1) (Data sources: #1, 2, R. Shapira; #3, 7, A. Lazaraton)

# Practice 11.4

1. Two or more negative pretixes can be applied to the same word. What difference in meaning is signaled by the prefixes?

unnconnected vs.disconnected unclassified vs. declassified un-American vs. non-American nonobedient vs. disobedient disinterested vs. uninterested

2. English speakers convert this systematicity into games with examples such as those collected by C. Campbell: "Can a skirt be depleted?" "Can the tireplace be dismantled?" "Can the addict be disjointed?" "Can the church be dismembered?" "Can a politician be devoted?" What examples can you add? Do you think Shakespeare in writing Julius Caesar puzzled over the line "the most unkindest cut of all . . . most unkind . . . unkindest . . . least kind . . . least most kindest?

3. Pretixes are not highly regular, which leads to learner errors such as the following:

The opposite of expand is inpand.   
American personality almost the outgoing but Chinese peoples is almost ingoing.

Prepare a pilot test for such opposite prefixes. Administer the test to three language learners and three native speakers. What do your findings suggest?

4. The prefix mini- seems to be going out of style. We don't see examples like minibus, miniskirt, and minigolf as often as in the past, although minimarkets and minimalls are ubiquitous. Check through your local newspaper for examples of this prefix. Do you agree or disagree with our claim? Do you find many entries for micro-? How do miniand micro- differ in meaning?

5. If you have access to a large database such as the Lund or Brown corpora, select one overlapping set of pretixes.

Find all the entries for these prefixes across as many different genres as you can. What do you discover?

6. If you have beginners who use no in the way it is used in the two Spanish L1 examples given earlier, how might you go about encouraging them to use standard negative prefixes? Do posted warning signs such as "No passing," "No refunds," "No parking." "No smoking" encourage the use of no as a general negator? How important is first language transfer in explaining these negation errors?

# Derivational sutfixes

Suffixes are much less easy to group on a semantic basis than are prefixes. Most suffixes change words from nouns to verbs, adjectives to adverbs, and so forth. We will begin with nouns, then verbs, adjectives, and adverbs.

# Nouns

After suffixes are added, many nouns remain as nouns but the meaning changes. Quirk and Greenbaum (1973) list three noun-to-noun occupational suffixes: -ster, -eer, and -er as in gangster, engineer, and New Yorker. Four noun-to-noun diminutives or feminine endings: -let, -ette, -ess, and - $\boldsymbol { y } _ { \boldsymbol { \mathsf { s } } }$ -ie as in piglet, cigarette, waitress, and cookie. Four noun-tonoun forms have to do with status or domain: -hood as in childhood, -ship as in friendship, -dom as in kingdom, -ocracy, (ejry as in democracy and priory. Some count nouns can be changed to mass nouns with the affix -ing: for example, tops becomes topping, covers becomes covering, and panel becomes paneling. Other count nouns can be changed to have the meaning of amount using -ful: cup, cupful; mouth, mouthful. If you try to find additional examples for each of these noun-to-noun derivations, you will find that they vary in terms of productivity.

Quirk and Greenbaum list five noun-to-adjective suffixes: -ite, -(iJan, -ese, -ist, and -ism. With application of these affixes, the semantic notion of a membership group is added. Examples include socialite, Republican, Chinese, conservationist, communism.

# Verbs

There is a much larger group of affixes that change verbs to nouns. The affixes -er, -or, and -ant all have the meaning of agent or instrument: plumber, actor, inhabitant, disinfectant. The "one who" meaning is also shown by the -ee morpheme, but it is passive. That is, an employee is someone who is employed by someone else. Several endings have to do

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

with states or actions: -ation, -ment, -al (exploration, amazement, refusal). Others have an activity or result of activity meaning: -ing, -age (driving, building, drainage).

# Adjectives

Adjectives can be changed to nouns by a variety of suffixes. The forms -ness and -ity are used with states or quality as in happiness and sanity. Three suffixes transform nouns or adjectives into verbs with a causative meaning: -ify, -ize, -en (amplify, mechanize, sadden). Other affixes are used to change nouns to adjectives. The suffix $- f u l$ gives nouns the meaning of giving or having (e.g., helpful); -less adds the meaning of without (e.g., bopeless); -ly and -like mean having the quality of (wifely, childlike). We have said that the ending $f _ { 3 l } ^ { * } .$ , often spelled - $\mathbf { \nabla } ^ { \cdot \mathbf { y } }$ or -ie, adds a diminutive or endearing quality. Quirk and Greenbaum list it in the noun-to-noun feminine/diminutive category, but note that $\hbar \uparrow$ , spelled $- y ,$ is also an adjective morpheme meaning like (dreamy) or covered with (muddy). The suf fix -ish means belonging to or having the character of (Moorish, foolish).

Quirk and Greenbaum show that some adjective suffixes occur primarily in borrowed and neoclassical words: -al in editorial and musical, +ic in heroic, -ive in attractive, and sensitive and -ous in virtuous and courteous.

Other adjective suffixes change verbs to adjectives: -able, -ible as in readable, forcible. Above we noted that -ish can change a noun to an adjective, but it can also grade adjectives, as in youngish. The suffix -ed has many functions, but one is to change the phrase "having a NOUN" into an adjective. "Having a point" becomes the adjective pointed.

# Adverbs

Adverbs can be derived from adjectives using -ly (quickly, strangely), -ward (backward), or they can be derived from nouns with -wise (lengthwise). The use of -wise to mean "as far as $\boldsymbol { x }$ is concerned" has been overused in recent years, in particular on news reports (weatherwise, budgetwise, conferencewise). It provides an easy way to signal a shift in topic in such programs.

Derivational affixes are used to form new creations all the time. Here are two new noun -- verb creations. A friend who had just finished scooping out a pumpkin for a Hallowe'en jack-o-lantern, laughed and said, "I sure pumpkinized my hands!" Ross Perot, a 1992 presidential candidate said, "Foreign aid is not foreign policy; it's charitizing the world. $^ { \circ } \ S \circ ,$ although we probably never think about derivational affixes as separate from the words in which they occur, we still use such affixes to create new and original combinations.

# Practice 11.5

1. In the following exercise from Yorkey's Study Skills (1982), students are asked to create new words from old by changing affixes. Fill in the blanks. Which entries change meanings in ways other than change of word class?

<html><body><table><tr><td>Noun</td><td>Verb</td><td>Adjective</td><td>Adverb</td></tr><tr><td>imagination</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>consideration</td><td></td><td>repeated</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>succeed</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>comparatively</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

2. The following suffix errors are from compositions of university-level international students. In each case, supply the correct affix. Why do you think the learner made the error?

The problem that made me suffer was no satified sentence to express my thought.(Chinese L1)

Today Haagen Dazs ice cream to have captured the corner on ice cream chic in U.S. because of some special unique.(Vietnamese L1)

Note the beautiful compound "ice cream chic' and the idiomatic use of "capture the corner on," to say nothing ot the poetry of chic and unigue!

There are so many rules and exceptions that are very mathematically. (Japanese L1)

For good notes taking, I believe we have our own way of diagrammation and symboling which we develop from experiencing and using.  (Spanish L1)

3. How would you account for the fact that native English speakers also make such errors? In the first of the following examples, a professor made the error in a lecture. In the second, the native speaker was talking about economic systems. (Versitel is an automatic banking system many Americans use.) The third example was a comment on Malcolm X as a role model for teenagers.

Another way of symboling that 'er' schwa r sound -- This may become a universital system, worldwide. ... they should be that resourcive, intelligent.

4. When native speakers use incorrect forms like pronunciate, it may be that they do so on the basis of analogy (perhaps with enunciate) or a blend process (pronunciation and enunciate). Identify the error, list the torm you would use in each case, and then see if you can think of an analogy that might be involved for the tollowing data. The examples, collected by A. Lazaraton, are oral rather than written.

a. I'm memoried most of songs. (Japanese L1)   
b. These materials would be good for an auto mechan. ician course. (Korean L1)   
c. This year is a very activity year. (Chinese L1)   
d. tMany anirnals want to competate to be chosen.(Chinese L1)

# Other derivational processes

In this chapter we have presented common English prefixes and suffixes that are used to derive new words from old. Other languages $,$ use other methods to achieve the same goal, or use similar processes but in different ways. We discussed prefixes as derivations, but in some languages prefixes are used for verb tense, for plurals, or (as a pronoun marker) for the person carrying out the verb action. Instead of derivations, they are inflections. Gasser (1993) gives us tbe Swahili example nilikuona, a word meaning "I saw you." It consists of four morphemes added to the verb stem -on-. These include three before the verb: ni- is the pronoun marker, $\therefore i =$ is the past tense marker, and $\therefore k u -$ is the direct object affix for second person singular. (The suffix -a means a neutral, not negative or subjunctive mood.) All of these affixes have syntactic (inflectional) meanings.

In some languages, morphology changes may not be carried by a morpheme but rather by a change in phonology. In Chichewa, for example. using a relatively high tone can change a verb form from present to past tense. There are even languages where something is deleted to signal a change in meaning. Martin (1988) gives us an exampie from Koasati where verbs have plural forms that are changed to the singular by deleting a portion of the singular form.

Root elaboration is a major process in Afro-Asiatic and especially Semitic languages. In tbese languages, different forms of rclated words are built around a common root. In Arabic, for example, the root ktb is used to form many related words. Katab means "he wrote," maktab is "office," kitaab is "book," kutub is "books," kaatib is "having written." Each vowel addition changes the root to a new word.

In English, verbs can be of almost any length. They can be short (see) or long (decontextualize). In Arabic, verbs have three basic shapes ( $C =$ consonant, ${ \pmb v } =$ vowel) CvCvC (as in katab), CvCCvC (killim, to speak) or CvvCvC (saafir, to travel). Fach of these verb shapes can be further elaborated to form new words just as, in English, we can add additional affixes to verbs.

# Practice 11.6

1. The root in the tollowing Arabic data consists of three consonants. What are they and what does the root mean?

daras he studied darris he taught madrasa school mudarris teacher dars lesson tidrisu you (pl) study

2. We said that verb shapes in Arabic can be changed to sig. nal changes in meaning. Look at the following pairs. What meaning change has been signaled by changing the root Shape?

daras to study   
darris to teach   
tala' to rise, go up   
talla' to take up, make rise   
nizil to go down, descend   
nazzil to take down   
kibir to grow   
kabbar to enlarge

Does your hypothesized meaning for the double consonants hold for the following pairs?

nidiit clean naddaf to clean masr Egypt massar to Egyptianize kibiir big kabbar to enlarge sugayyar small saggar to reduce the size mumkin possible makkin to enable, make possible.

3. There are five basic verb conjugations in Hebrew, labeled paal, nifal, piel, hitpael, and hifil. In each conjugation, the form is derived from the root in a slightly different way.

a. piel: tiput treating bidur entertaining kinus responding / response bikur visiting / visit bikus demanding / demand sipur storytelling   
b. paal: amira protecting / protection bniya building bhira choosing / choice mxira selling / sale stina forgiveness   
c. hifit: haakama agreeing / agreement kaxiata deciding / decision hafsaka stop / stopping hathala beginning   
d. nital: hismrut being protected hitaqiut encountering / encounter himaltut escaping / escape heragut calming down

e. hitpael: hithadsut renewing hitanyenut taking an interest (Data source: R. Altman)

What are the consonant (C) and vowel (v) patterns for each group in the data? By knowing the root, the verb conjugation pattern, and the grammatical category, you can produce the correct forms in these examples. Unfortunately, this only works for some words, not for all. As with English, there is a wide variety of possible morphological shapes.

4. Compare the Hebrew example with the previous Arabic data. Would you guess that Arabic and Hebrew are related languages? In Amharic (according to Gasser, 1993) masbar means "to break" and sabbar-a means "he broke." Based on this data, would you make any predictions about the relationship among Amharic, Hebrew, and Arabic? Justify your answer.

5. Gasser (1993) divides morpheme types in language according to where they occur relative to the word stem. A morpheme can be a prefix (before the stem), a suffix (after the stem), an infix (where a morpheme is inserted between the stem and another affix), a circumfix (where part of a morpheme precedes and part follows the stem), a mutation (as in irregular plurals mouse- mice), a deletion (as Martin, 1988, says is done with Koasati plurals) and root elaboration (as in the Arabic and Hebrew examples presented earlier). Of these, which do you think would be the easiest to learn? which do you think would be the most difficult? Give your rationale.

# Research and application

1. Badecker and Caramazza (1989) studied the language of a 60- year-old Italian who had suffered brain damage (acute intracerebral hematoma) resulting in language deficits. His spontaneous speech showed omission or misselection of morphemes. The comparison of errors in derivational and inflectional morphemes shows many more inflection than derivation errors. One could argue that this is evidence that derivations are more lexical in nature; that is, that words are learned and stored as single units. Inflections, on the other hand, mmight be stored separately and put together as the sentence is produced. Read the article and consider alternative explanations for the data.

2. Pillon et al. (l99l) discuss the language of a patient diagnosed as having Wernicke's aphasia. JPC is a 33-year-old Belgian male whose first language is French but who also knew some English, Dutch, German, and Italian. In contrast to the patient described in Badecker and Caramazza, JPC displayed large numbers of errors in derivational morphology. In picture-naming tasks, the error rate was as high as 50 percent. The authors suggest that such data can be used to address the question of whether words are constructed from stems and affixes or whethar the whole word is stored and retrieved intact. Further, they tested Bybee's hypothesis that words are constructed only when they are very low-frequency items and have regular patterns of affixation. Otherwise, according to this hypothesis, they are represented and retrieved as whole words. To test this, they divided the error database into high-frequency versus mid- and low-frequency words and according to regular and irregular affixes. The findings showed that word frequency had a definite effect on the error rate while the difference between regular vs. irregular affixes was not so great.

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>High frequency.</td><td>Mid/low frequency</td></tr><tr><td>Regular</td><td>16.7%</td><td>54.0%</td></tr><tr><td>Irregular</td><td>25.9%</td><td>60.0%</td></tr></table></body></html>

The authors note that JPC often was able to retrieve the first part of a word for a pictured item correctly but not the entire word. This was shown in omissions (noix for noisette, fourche for fourchetfe, mu for mouton). Successful retrieval of the initial parts of words with errors in inflections were common (e.g., palmiste for palmier, sucette for sucrier). One solution (whether the problem is with derivations or with retrieval of the final parts of words) might be to look at derivational prefixes rather than suffixes. Bybee's hypothesis is interesting and could be further tested with adult foreign and second language learners. Whether derivational morphology is a real process for learners (or ouly a convenient way to describe linguistic forms) is an important theoretical issue that also has implications regarding the teaching of prefixes versus suffixes. Design a research project that would allow you to test the hypothesis.

3. Clark and Hecht (1982) have shown that children comprehend the derivational affix -er as an agent and as an instrument (agent: "He's a farmer'; instrument: "It's a cutter'). Although they comprehend both uses, they use only the agent form. Derwing (l976) and Derwing and Baker (1979) investigated children's use of -ly, -y, and -ie, finding that these suffixes appear relatively late. Read these studies and prepare a pilot test to use with young second or foreign language learners (or for adults acquiring the language). Administer your test to three learners and report the results. If your results look promising, you might want to expand this project to include a wider variety of affixes.

4. We said that -er means "one who" - no more, no less. But Randall (1988) notes that there are two types of forms for "one who" -- complex forms with the -er and simple forms without the -er. So, for example, pilot differs from flier, chef differs from baker, ballerina differs from dancer, soprano differs from singer. Randall shows that these two types occur in different types of sentences. We say "a singer of sad songs" but not "a soprano of sad songs"; "a baker of fancy foods" but not "a chef of fancy foods." Adjectives can be used to modify both types but the meaning is different. A beautiful ballerina is a ballerina who happens to be beautiful. A beautiful dancer can mean that the person is good at dancing. Prepare a test to discover whether students (who already know the terms) can identify appropriate and inappropriate use of the simple and complex forms.

5. C. Chomsky (1970) used morphology to help children work on the spelling of problematic words. One problem area is the spelling of vowels that are said to be reduced because they do not receive word stress. For example, "dem.. -cratic" is difficult unless it is mentally related to democracy. "Comp  rable" is difficult unless it is related to compare. Children are asked to supply the missing vowel in such lists and then to give a related word to justify the spelling choice. This method is also used to assist children in their search for correct consonants (in examples such as medicine-- medical, racial-race, gradual-grade) or to pick up silent consonants (as in muscle-muscular, sign-signature, maligu-malignant). Prepare a research plan to test this techrique with second language learners who might profit from such instruction.

6. McDonald's restaurant claims that the prefix Mc is part of its trademark. The company brought suit to stop Quality Inns from using the word McS/eep for a chain of motels. R. Gozzi, Jr. (199z) notes that the newspaper USA Today is often called McPaper. He suggests that Mc means something like cheap, quick, small bites. Prepare a list of words with this prefix and administer it to speakers of different ages. Do you see patterns in the meaning and acceptabihity judgments for these words across speaker groups? If your results look promising, you might want to submit this as a paper to the WHIM conference, or for publication in Verbatim.

7. Mettinger (l990) discusses the forms and meanings of the affix -able. The affix can be attached to a verb (e.g., breakable, eatable) or to a noun (e.g., marriageable, knowledgeable). Those attached

Vocabulary, semantics, and language education to verbs have the meaning of "likely to be Yed, capable of being Yed' and so show modality such as possibility or necessity. Those attached to nouns have the meaning that "Y has already been evaluated" as positive or negative, as in knowledgeable, pleasurable, honorable. Mettinger then tries to find correspondences of the prefix ke in Chinese to the suffix -able in English. If you teach (or are learning) Chinese, read this article and comment on Mettinger's treatment of the correspondences in forms and meanings in the two languages.

8. Gasser (1993) and Gasser and Lee (199l) have developed connectionist models (computer models of learning). which make detailed predictions about the learning difficulty of particular types of morphology in languages. Gasser (1993) includes a review of connectionist experiments, beginning with Rumelhart and McClelland's (1986) classic on past tense morphemes. Connectionism challenges symbolic models of language and language learning such as those proposed by Chorusky. Read the Gasser articles and desigu a study to test some of the predictions in them.

# 12 Inflectionel morphology

# Inflections

Although sone affixes allow us to derive new words from old, others have more grammatical functions. These inflectional endings give us information about the relation between words in sentences or utterances.

In contrast to derivational morphemes, the number of inflections is small and they apply more regularly across a larger range of items. They are more regular and productive, yet language learners still struggle with them. Perhaps for that reason, they form the basis of most grammarbased programs of language instruction.

English inflections for nouns include plural and possessive. The plural of boy is boys; the possessive of teacher is teacher's. The set of inflections for verbs include present third person singular, past, progressive, perfective (drives, drove, driving, driven). Adjectives and adverbs are inflected for comparison (larger, largest; quicker, quickest). Natural gender marks John as masculine and Joanna as feminine, so these nouns are referred to with the pronouns he and she. Pronouns are inflected for gender and case (he, him, his; she, her, hers; who, whose, whom).

Although ir is true that inflectional morphology is much more regular than derivational morphology, there are irregular forms. We know that some nouns have irregular plurals (children, cherubim, alumnae) and some have a "zero" plural morpheme (deer, sheep). Others involve change of vowels in the word stem (men, geese, mice). Most nouns, other than those that refer to humans, are not marked for gender, yet some are. So ship is feminine at least for those speakers who refer to ships with the pronoun she.

There are a larger number of irregular forms for verbs, especially for the past tense morpheme -ed (took, cut, went). The perfective forms may also vary but the two most common are -ed and -en (have walked, have eaten).

The comparative inflections are -er and -est (sooner, soonest; quicker, quickest), but the grammatical function words more and most are used with longer adjectives and adverbs (more, most intelligent; more, most sensibly). If the word has two syllables, the choice depends on the word form. Pretty becomes prettier , not more pretty; alert becomes more alert, not alerter.

mark all plurals. Do we say six foot tall or six feet tall, a two-semester course or a two-semesters course? So there is variability even within individual ideolects.

# Practice 12.1

1. For each of the following, circle and identify the inflections.

eating baked pastries sings songs softer mine girls' girl's slept pumpkins sweetest

2. What are the past tense morphemes for each of the tollow. ing verbs: take, cut, lie, go, set, am. Look at the explanations for these irregular forms in a course book. Should all irregular categories be presented at once? If not, what suggestions would you make regarding sequence?

3. Shirahata (1988) provides data from a group of thirty-one Japanese high school EFL students. Only fourteen ot the thirty-one students had irregular past tense errors. The errors included: falled, catched, standed, taked, hided, speaked, weared, blowed, leaved, runned, waked. Supply the correct past tense form for each item. If you teach ESL or EFL, are these typical of errors your students make? The data were collected by asking students to tell familiar fairy tales. How might this have influenced the range of verb errors?

4. List three adjectives and adverbs and supply the comparative and superlative forms. How many use -er and -est? Form the comparative and superlative of the following positive forms.

Adverbs: soon, lately, quietly, currently, today, here Adjectives: pretty, quiet, beautiful, current, daily

What is the difference in meaning between 'They in the Forum' and "They be in the Forum'? In this case, the colIoquial dialect seems more precise than standard English. How would this distinction be accomplished in standard English?

# Morpheme acquisition studies

As mentioned previously, Berko's (1958) famous study examined the acquisition of inflectional morphology using drawings of imaginery creatures and nonsense words (the $\mathbf { \ w } _ { \mathbf { u g } } \mathbf { \ w }$ test). The point of using nonsense words is to be sure that learners have not simply memorized individual words with their morphological endings intact. The test consists of 27 items, each testing a particular morpheme, similar to the following examples (for exact items, see Berko, 1958).

This is a wug. Now there are two of them. There are two - ? (wugs /z/ voiced form of plural)   
This is a bird who knows how to rick. It is ricking. It did the same thing yes. terday. What did it do yesterday?   
Yesterday it - ? (ricked /t/ voiceless form of past tense)   
This is a nizz. Now there are two of them. There are two -- ? (nizzes /az/ form of plural)   
This is a frog who knows how to mot. He is motting. He did the same thing yesterday. What did he do yesterday? Yesterday he -- ? (motted /id/ form of the past tense).   
This is a little wug. What would you call such a small wug? It's a - ? (wuggy, wuglet - diminutive)   
This wug lives in this house. What would you call a house a wug lives in? It's a - ? (wughouse, wug-home, wugwam - noun compounding)   
This is a blick. Now there are two of them. There are two -- ? (blicks /s/ voiceless form of plural)

The results showed that children had acquired plural, possesive, -ing continuous, past, and present. There were differences between preschool and first grade groups mainly on forms that require an additional syllable (nizzes, motted). Adults also made a few errors in deciding whether an additional syllahle was needed or not (e.g., wugzez hat).

The wug test has been adapted for Spanish by Kernan and Blount (1966):

Esta es una tifa. Ahora hay otra. Hay dos de ellas. Hay dos - ?   
Este es un hombre que sabe ticar. Esta ticando. Como se llama un hombre   
que tica?   
El hombre tica. Manana lo hara. Manana, el - ?

Swain et al. (1972) constructed a French version of the test for Canadian children attending a French immersion kindergarten. Sample items include:

Voici un gof. Maintenant voici deux - ?   
Voici un homme qui pole. Hier il a - ?   
Voici une fille qui est cherte. Voici aussi un garcon qui est - ?   
Voici un homme gui dape. Demain il va - ?   
Voici un homme qui va tifer. Maintenant il - ?

Although the wug test has the potential of showing the order in which morphemes are accurately supplied, it has seldom been used for this purpose. Morpheme acquisition has more typically been studied using natural language data, tracking the order in which morphernes are acquired (usually 90 percent correct in obligatory instances over a twoweek period is the criterion of acquisition). Brown (1973) and deVilliers and deVilliers (1973) have rank ordered the acquisition of a set of fourteen grammatical morphemes by child L1 learners. Some of these are bound morphemes and others (such as prepositions) are free. Table 12.2 shows their orders of acquisition.

We said that action words are acquired early. These words allow children to talk about actions in the here and now. Transitive actions such as hug and bite and intransitive actions sucb as go, sleep, sit serve this purpose. An -ing form of these verbs (e.g., playing, kissing, smiling) is needed to talk about the now of ongoing actions. So the -ing of the present progressive is acquired early. This progressive aspect morpheme shows continuing action (e-g., "She is swimming" shows that the action in the verb is ongoing, not completed). The semantic notion of ongoing action is transparent to most language learners. In addition, there is only one form, -ing, to add to the verb itself. So, it is not surprising that child L1 learners (and learners of ESL and EFL) begin using this verb form very early.

The early division between completed (past) and noncompleted actions and the acquisition of -ing for ongoing action has led to claims that learners first acquire aspect. Antinucci and Miller (1976), among others, have argued that initially children have no real understanding of verb tense. What appears to be early use of tense is really based on the semantics of aspect, whether actions are completed or not. It may seem that children use the past tense when they are primarily attending to completion vs. noncompletion of actions. For example, they may use past tense with transitive action verbs (e.g., spill) that have a clear end result. At the same time, they will not use past tense with verbs without a clear end result (e.g., sleep, play). So, children between $\frac { 1 } { 2 }$ and $^ { 2 \% }$ say "spilled the juice" but "play Bobby house." This is sometimes called "the primacy of aspect" hypothesis in acquisition studies. Others have argued against this interpretation. Weist (1986) claims that by 20 months children refer to both past and nonpast in terms of time via tense (and not just as completed and not completed as in aspect).

Brown (1973) and the deVilliers (1973) studies of the order of acquisition in child language provided the impetus for many similar studies with L2 learners of English from many different L1 groups and age levels and from instructed as well as uninstructed learners. The first to use Brown's methodology with longitudinal data was Hakuta's (1974) study of a Japanese child learning English. The morphemes studied, examples of the 8-year-old child's production, and the order of acquisition are shown in Table 12.3. The order of acquisition is that shown in the table. Most of the studies that followed were cross-sectional where data were gathered from a large number of subjects only once, so the order obtained is an accuracy order rather than an acquisition order. The test instruments most often used to elicit the data were Burt et al.'s (1973) Bilingual Syntax Measure and Fathman's (1976) SLOPE (second language oral proficiency test).

Krashen (1977) summarized the findings of many of these morpheme studies in bis claim for a "natural" order of acquisition (Figure 12.1). Although there may be variation in orders within each box, the order between boxes should not vary.

Although the many morpheme studies have been interpreted as showing a natural order for all learners regardless of first language or age, there are also clear examples of L1 influence. We all know that the articles $\pmb { \alpha }$ and the are not as easily acquired by Asian students as students from other areas. Therefore, the order cannor be strictly the same across all learners. Indeed, if we look at the studies case by case, we find many examples that demonstrate the influence of the first language.

One interesting example is Kuwahata's (1984) study of Japanese high school students. In Japanese, the possessive construction is marked with a case marker no, which is placed between the possessor and the object possessed, so that "This is John's pen" might be translated as Korewa John no pen (desu). We might predict then that forms such as "John's pen" would be very easy: substitute the -'s for no. However, the Japanese no has three possible meanings. John no hon could mean John's book - a book that belongs to John, a book which was written by John, and a book that was written about John. The following examples show the form is not the same in the two languages:

![](img/eb56a9c7c1adf0286aeb1cbaa9b9b0b5c8eb1f9c4978fb4bb21463c942d035f6.jpg)

Direct translation baseball's book baseball's player south's country hometown's memory wood's desk

English book about baseball baseball player country in the south hometown memories wooden desk

In addition, Japanese has a structure no mono which is equivalent to the shortened form no. In answer to " Whose book is this?" (Korewa dare no hon desu-ka?), the answer would be John no (mono) desu ("It's John's"). Because the possessive -'s initially seems so similar to these Japanese structures, we can almost predict what might happen. Kuwahata's EFL learners used the possessive for the "about" meaning, transfering all the uses of the Japanese form to English. And they overused the possessive - $\pmb { \dot { s } }$

.. dropped three watermelon's seed.

The students had close to perfect scores (98 percent correct) when a $\mathbf { \Gamma } _ { - } ? { \boldsymbol { s } }$ form should be used, but low scores when a $\mathrm { \bf { \bar { N } } } o f \mathrm { \bf { N } }$ was required. The result of such oversuppliance of the $\mathbf { \nabla } _ { - } \mathbf { \dot { s } }$ is to lower the scores for the possessive (but not low enough to make it fit into the box hypothesized as the natural order). Conversely, students from other language groups may undersupply the $\therefore$ form. If we look only at scores, nuch of this information is lost.

1. If you want to use a Wug test for your own purposes, you might wish to compare the non-English-language versions mentioned in this section and those of Perez-Pereira (1989) for Spanish and Bogoyaulenskiy (1973) for Russian. What are the strengths and weaknesses of these tests for your research goals?   
2. If you know Japanese, supply the direct Japanese translation of these forms produced by Kuwahata's students: guitar's school, paper's back, mountain's top, everybody's behind, college's circle, class's time. Then supply the correct English form.   
3. Koike's (1983) study of three children, ages 5, 7, and 10, provides examples of both errors and correct forms for English possessives. Would L1 transfer help explain the variation in correct and incorrect forms or might other explanations be required? a. She's name is Lisa.   
b. Drink the lemon's juice.   
c. . .. with the tree's blossom.   
d. New York's Kennedy Airport.   
e. Washington zoo is bigger than Tokyo's zoo.

4. As you read E\$L or EFL compositions, make a list of inflectional errors. Are there common patterns? Select the paper that has the most errors for any one morpheme. Calculate the percent ot correct use for that morpheme in the composition. If the percent is above $80 \%$ , do you believe the errors are due to carelessness or is there some discernible explanation tor whatever variability you find?

5. Shapira's (1978) friend Zoila used -ing forms and the base forms of verbs almost exclusively:

I no liking snow.   
I no liking he liking many girl.   
My family needing money.

Native English speakers talking with Zoila also adopted her -ing forms. Clyne (1981), too, gives examples of native speakers of English using the same -ing forms used by their grandmother, a native speaker of Greek:

You knowing how make baklava?   
You makin' pita?   
You wantin' one?   
What you goin' doing?

These people did not use these forms when speaking with their grandfather. Do you think the primacy of -ing in their talk must be due to the saliency and frequency of these forms in the leamers' talk? Or, do you think the matching is a way of showing affection and social bonding?

# Errors in infleotions and derivations

If you ask a native speaker to judge the seriousness of errors in morphology, they will always judge individual inflectional errors more negatively than derivational errors. Perhaps this is because we have been taught to avoid "grammar errors" at all costs. We may be thought careless or uneducated if we say, "I seen that signature on the letter," but such errors as ${ \bf * } _ { \mathrm { ~ I ~ } }$ saw that signaturing on the letter" may very well go unnoticed. If a native speaker says, "Ir was a jubilous day," it sounds charming, but if someone says, "it'a grey day," it does not. These values are instilled, in part, by our educational system. There is nothing in the language system itself that says one type of error is more important than another.

# Practics 12.3

1. The following composition was written by a Vietnamese student of English. Find five errors that relate to morphology. Which are more lexical and which are more grammatical in nature? which errors seem to affect intelligibility most?

# Tratfic in LA

In order to solve the biocking traffic on the treeway and the air pollution problem on Los Angeles, the government suggest that each car on freeway is better carpooling. It means three or more people in a car. It will decrease the number of cars which transport in the freeway. Therefore, it wilt decrease the air poliution which make by the exhaust of the car and the traffic will not also slow down. If the people in Los Angeles don't decrease the number of cars which traffic in free way, they will easy get a lung con. gestion instead of traffic congestion.

2. Circle all the inflectional morphemes in the following composition written by an international student, a computer science major. What proportion are correct? Circle all the derivational rmorphemes and note what proportion are correct. Are derivational or inflectional morphemes more frequent in this composition?

# Artificail Inteligient

# Morphophonemic change

When morphemes are joined to the word base, it is quite common for changes to take place that make the new word easier to pronounce. These are called morphophonemic changes. The change may occur in the base or in the affix. We have already seen two examples of this phenomenon. The past tense morpheme -ed has three different forms: a voiceless /t/, a voiced /d/ and a syllabic $\hbar \mathrm { d } / \hbar$ , and the plural -s has three different pronunciations: a voiceless $I _ { \Delta } l ,$ a voiced $/ z f$ and a syllabic /az/. In these examples, the consonant of the affix takes on the voiced or voiceless characteristics of the preceding sound in the stem. If the word stem ends in the same or similar sound, a syllabic form is used. These are examples of assimilation, a very common process in normal speech.

Three major different types of morphophonemic change -- assimilation, contraction, and metathesis - occur in most languages. In assimilation, the sounds of the morpheme and of the base are changed to make them more similar to each other. Look at the following data:

illegal immodest irrelevant inadmissible illiterate impossible irreversible inept illogical immoral irresponsible inequitable

If you look at the last column, you will see that the negative prefix has the form in-; it does not change to agree with the following vowel. In the Other cases, however, the nasai $\pmb { \mathscr { n } }$ is pronounced at the same atticulation point as the following consonant. If you observe carefully how you articulate the in of inconceivable, incapable, ingratitude, you will feel your tongue move back to the position of the velar consonants too. In the case of liquids, I and $\pmb { r }$ , the quality changes from a nasal to agree with the following liquid.

Given that we have different pronunciations for this negative prefix, how can we say that it has one form with the same meaning? The key is being able to assign one form as the basic form and working out a rule that predicts what the variants of the morpheme would be. In this case, the general form is in- and the other forms can be predicted as assimilation to the articulation point of the following sound (and the additional change to liquid for I and $_ r$

As affixes are added to form new words, contraction or dropping of parts of morphemes may occur. For example, in English we join can and not and drop the second vowel to yield can't. Contraction is also a common rype of morphophonemic change. Metathesis is much less common in languages. In English, young children often say /pusketi/ or /busketi/ for spaghetti. The consonant $\star$ vowe! opening sequence, pu- and bu-, is much easier for them than the $s p$ cluster. This change in order of elements is called metathesis.

# Practice 12.4

1. Explain the morphophonemic rule for the three variants of -ed past tense morpheme.   
2. Explain the morphophonemic rules for the three variants of the plural morpheme -s. Does this same rule apply to possessives and third person, singular present tense -s? How do you form the plural possessives (the Jones' house or the Joneses' house)?   
3. Arabic places an article e/ before nouns. While it is always written as if, its pronunciation varies. Explain the morphophonemic change involved in the following examples: il beet the house il gidiid the new il walad the boy il kitaab the book il mudarris the teacher il wara' the paper it tarabeeza the table it talg the ice id dars the lesson is sana the year in nuur the light iz zaayir the visitor ir raagil the man is santa the brietcase il filuus the money is simaal the left

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

4. In French, contraction is especially interesting in terms of masculine and feminine adjectives:

Feminine Masculine Gloss /sod/ /\$o/ hot /fres! /fre/ fresh /frwad/ /trws/ cold /movez/ /move/ bad /ptit/ /pti/ little /sul/ /su/ drunk

If you were given a French feminine adjective, how might you derive the masculine form? Given the masculine form of any adjective, could you derive the teminine form? Which is the base form?

# Research and application

1. In the early stages of language learning, many learners do not use inflectional morphology, or they use one form to serve many purposes (e.g., use -ing or the base form for all verbs). This telegraphic form of talk has often been compared to that of agrammatic aphasics. Menn and Obler (l990) have edited a book with agrammatic aphasic data samples from fourteen different languages (with morphemic translations and English transliterations). If you teach or are studying one of these languages, consult the data to see how sinuilar your language or that of your students matches that of these patients. (We are not saying that language learning and language disabilities are the same, only that the problems in producing or retrieving morphemes during performance in one area may shed light on sinilar problems in another.)   
2. Results similar to those of Antinucci and Miller (1976) regarding the primacy of aspect have been reported by Ferreiro and Sinclair (197l) and Bloom et al. (l980). This claim, however, has been questioned by Weist (1986), Weist et al. (1984) and Shirai (1990b, 1993). Read and critique these papers. Is the primacy of aspect claim valid? Do you believe it also applies to the learning of other languages by children and adults?   
3. Pfaff (198l) reports on the acquisition of many different inflectional morphemes and syntactic forms by German second language learners. The data for this study were elicited in individual interviews with fifty-seven children in three age groups (5-6, 9-- 11, 12-15). Included in this sample were speakers of Turkish, Greek, Yugoalavian, Lebanese, and American English. Features analyzed included 0 subject, gender, number, 0 article, indirect

object, 0 copula, $\pmb { \emptyset }$ auxiliary, agreement, verb forms, negation, prepositions, 0 prepositions, 0 conjunctions, conjunction, inversion, noninversion, infinitive last, participle last, and subordinate clauses. If you are learning or if you teach German, compare the forms used by these children with those produced by adult foreign language learners.

4. Chimombo (l979) found that the order of acquisition of English morphemes for Tina, a Chichewa-English bilingual child, did not correlate with those of Brown (l973) for Ll children nor with those of Hakuta's (1974) Japanese-English child. The acquisition order obtained from the child (between $18 \%$ months and $30 \%$ months) also does not strictly agree with Krashen's proposal (Figure 12.1). Review the explanations Chimombo gives for this variation in acquisition order. Could one review all the morpheme acquisition studies with a bias toward difference rather than universality in orders and arrive at very different conclusions from all the studies? what languages (L1 and L2) would you want to include in order to be able to make claims for or against universality in the acquisition of morphology?

5. One criticism of the morpheme acquisition studies is that there is no clear explanation for differences in the speed of acquisition of different types of morphemes. Researchers hypothesize that input, the L1, the number of forms for each morpheme, and degree of transparency of the semantic function of morphemes, and so forth, explain the findings. Connectionist studies (Gasser, 1993; Gasser and Lee, 1991) take a different approach. Instead of collecting acquisition data from child learners, they collect data from the computer as it attempts to sense morphology patterns in input data. The computer, hike humans, does not learn all forms (prefixes, infixes, suffixes, reduplication) at the same rate. If the learning patterns of computers are similar to those of second language learners, how might this new approach be used to test the hypotheses that have been proposed thus far to explain differences in acquisition?

# 13 Variation in vooabulary choice

The lexicon is a system that we construct collectively as a social, linguistic group. We then endlessly unmake and remake it in an effort to express our individuality. Shuy (1967) is surely not the first to note that lexical choices can tell us much about a person's age (ice box vs. refrigerator), gender (lovely vs. nice), geographic origin (pail vs. bucket), education (we was vs. we were), and occupation (lexemes vs. words). We will begin this chapter with a discussion of how lexical choice reveals age, gender, occupation, and cultural and regional origin. Then we will look at the ways groups and individuals show their preferences and biases through word selection and euphemism, followed by lexical choice that relates to discourse and formality.

# Geography

Linguistic fieldworkers have gathered much information on geographic variation by interviewing people from many different social groups in! many different areas of the United States. The results were first compiled in The Linguistic Atlas (Kurath, 1939-1943). The checklist used by fieldworkers asks for the word which the person customarily uses for the defined object. Do you, for exampie, say lightning bug, glow worm, firefly, or fire bug? Soft drink, soda, $\pmb { \hat { p } } \mathbf { o } \pmb { \hat { p } } .$ or tonic? Sweet corn or roasting ears? Spider webs or cobwebs? Scared or afraid? These choices depend in part on your geographic location. If you live in the northeast part of the United States, you are more likely to say pail than bucket. In the midwest and the South, more people use bucket (though pail is used by many urbanites living in the bucket area).

One area of dialect geography that is especially important for language teachers is the difference in word use among Australian, Canadian, American, and British English dialects. Among the many differences between American and British dialects are car terms like bonnet (hood), and boot (trunk), and windscreen (windshield), clothing terms like jumper (cardigan sweater), and braces (suspenders). To cross the street, Americans walk in the crosswalk, whereas British English pays attention to the stripes in the crosswaik and calls it a zebra zone. These differences are easily remembered. Less easy are the differences in word form correspondences such as maths and math.

Within each of these major dialects, there are, of course, regional variants of interest to linguists and teachers. Bryant (1989) prepared usage maps for variations in such terms as slide-slippery dip for a child's playground slide, blood nose-bleeding nose for a bloody nose, and dinkdouble dink (giving a passenger a ride on a bike) in Australian English. A report on a larger ongoing Australian study is given in Bryant (1991).

Dialect geography is particularly interesting when the areas analyzed have large immigrant populations. Hans Kurath (1945) and Carroll Reed (1961) worked extensively on regional dialects of Pennsylvania, showing the influence of German loanwords and loan translations on the English of the communities in which it became enmeshed. For example, the words for pancakes in much of the North Midwest area are hot-cakes in the eastern section and flannen/flannel cakes in the west. Flannen/flanne! cakes is said to be an anglicized form of the German word Pfannkuchen. Of course, by now some 40 to 50 years after this research, everyone there may very well say pancakes. With the advent of television, many of these geographic differences may have disappeared.

We know that the names of people vary by geographic area. Certain names are more popular in rural areas than in urban areas. Some are more popular in the Midwest or South than on the East or West Coasts. Some people even name their children after some geographic area (e.g., a child was named Rocky Mountain National Park after his parents' favorite place). Perhaps more upsetting is the imposition of name changes that happened as families emigrated from one geographic area to another. Ellis Island immigration officials, unable or unwilling to understand the names of new citizens, changed the names of many immigrants to something more English-sounding. This also happened as people, unable to learn American Indian names, assigned them new names - often names of American military leaders who had put down Indian uprisings. Because it is common in many American Indian cultures to change one's name to mark important developments in lifc, the change might not seem strange, but Indian groups solved the problem by using two names, reserving their Indian name for communication within their own social groups.

Another related issue is attrition of first languages in immigrant communities. There are individual case studies, small sample studies, and studies of large immigrant populations that show the gradual shifts in forms and meanings of lexical items as they are influenced or replaced by those of the new language. We would expect the changes to be fairly rapid, especially if the community is small or dispersed and cut off by great distance from the L1 community. We see these changes at the individual level in diary studies; expatriots often comment on not being able to recall words which they once used without hesitation. Group studies

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

show systematic changes as Iexical items are attrited. Clyne (1991) comments on the L1 data he obtained from 200 German-speaking and 200 Dutch-speaking immigrants to Australia. Transfer of English lexical items into German regularly occurred in the work domain (customer, office, college, shoppen, supervisen) and in social and recreational domains (beach, breakfast, watchen, relaxen). Semantic transfer also took place, especially in cognate forms. For example, the English word small influenced the use of German (schmal) and Dutch (smal). English meaning patterns also appear in the immigrants' use of the Dutch word stil and the German word still (meaning silent) rather than nog and noch (meaning still).

There are fascinating patterns in L1 use in immigrant groups. Salmons (1991) found that speakers of different dialects of the same language who immigrate and live near each other may use the new language for communication with each other rather than becoming bidialectal. Language shift in such conditions is multifaceted.

# Practice 13.1

1. For each of the following sets, circle the word you would ordinarily use. Compare your results with those of your colleagues or students. Can you see areal patterns in these differences? If you know other terms for the items, add them to the list and ask your colleagues if these choices are familiar to them as well. (For a more complete list of terms, see Orton, 1972.)

# Household

To put a single room of the house in order: clean up, do up, redd up, ridd up, straighten up, tidy up, put to rights, slick up

Devices at the edges of the root that carry off rain: eaves, eave spouts, eave troughs, gutters, rain troughs, spouting, spouts, water gutter

Paper container for groceries and so on: bag, poke, sack, toot, tote, tote bag

Foods

A carbonated drink: pop, soda, soda pop, tonic, soft drink Large sandwich designed to be a meal in itself: hero, submarine, hoagy, grinder, poor-boy   
Notice that these sandwiches all use a bread roll as the base. Some people use skyscraper or dagwood to refer to an oversized sandwich made with loaf-type bread. Do you use these terms too?

Games

Fast moving amusement park ride (on tracks): coaster, roller coaster, rolly-coaster, shoot-the-chutes, the ride of doom

Call to players to return because a new player wants to join: allie allie in free, allie allie oxen free, allie allie ocean free, bee bee bumble bee, everybody in free, newcomer newcomer

# School

To be absent from school: bag school, bolt, cook jack, lay out, lie out, play hookey, blow school, play truant, run out of school, skip class, skip school, ditch, tlick, flake school, sluff school

Drinking fountain: cooler, water cooler, bubbler, fountain, drinking fountain

# Miscellaneous

Somone who will not change his or her mind is: bull headed, contrary, headstrong, ornery, otsny, owly, pig headed, set, sot, stubborn, mulish, muley you're right: reckon, guess, figger, figure, suspect, imagine

2. When dialect differences involve inflectional morphology, we may be less forthright in saying what we say (rather than what we know to be correct). How might you get native speakers to use the word options shown as choices in the following items? Which do you say? If you sometimes say one and sometimes another, explain how context influences your choice.

a. It (don't, doesn't) matter.   
b. They (dived, dove) (right) in.   
c. My sweater (shrank, shrunk) in the dryer.   
d. Saturday I (laid, lay) in bed all day.   
e. You (hadn't ought, ought not) to do that.   
f. Seems (like, as if) we'll never get any rain.   
g. (Like, As) I told you, I feel the same (like, as) my mom.

3. Supply the American English equivalent of the following British English words:

biscuit chemist tap queue up chips cotton wool tramp roundabout draughts dustbin cinema sweet gangway pub flyover crisps

4. Give the British English equivalent of the following American English words:

baby carriage maitman gasoline billion raise (in salary) flashlight first floor truck second floor two weeks to mail janitor

5. Moskowitz (1990) notes that a drinking straw is called a popote in Mexico City, a pitillo in Colombia, a sorbete in Ecuador, and a cana in Panama. Traveling in Latin America, you may find differences in the use of the word claro, usually said with an inbreath. In most places it functions much like the English "um-hm' or "right." That is, it is a feedback signal to let the speaker know you're listening without taking away the turn to talk. However, in Mexico, the meaning changes from \*right" to something like "of course, you idiot!" From these examples and your own experience, how important do you think regional variants are for language leamers? Are such regional variations covered in your teaching/learning materiais?

6. Peters and Fee (1989) used Australian and Canadian magazines as a database to see the balance of British and U.S. terms such as film/movie. Prepare a plan to examine the use of these and other sets ot terms in English magazines in another dialect region (e.g., Indian English, Egyptian English).

7. Salmons (1991) used a questionnaire approach, asking immigrants to translate fifteen English sentences into German. Free conversation on linguistic topics also formed part of the database. Variations in forty lexical items were found across the various dialect groups in his immigrant study area (Dubois County, Indiana). Compare this data collection method with the direct questionnaire method used to obtain data for the Dialect Atlas of American English. How might the methods be combined to obtain richer data?

8. Moskowitz (1990) developed the "box of office supplies' method to look at areal differences in language use. The box contained items including crayons, chalk, business cards, a hole punch, thumbtacks, an ink pad, and rubber bands. High school graduates in different areas were asked to name the objects. Variation was found in the use of the terms. Design a similar project to investigate geographic differences in use of terms you find interesting.

9. Are regional variants presented in your language teaching materials? Are there differences in treatment in materials for second language versus foreign language leamers?

# Gender

A great deal has been wrirten about sexist terms that men and women use to refer to each other. Women have noted that there have been few parallel male words to the pejorative terms for women (chick, doll, dame, babe, skirt, and broad, to name but a few). Is this changing (jock, hunk, stud, and perhaps suit and three-piece are equivalents to skirt)? Violent terms are often used in describing women (e.g., smashing, stunning, ripping, cracking) and more rarely to describe men. The terms we use to refer to people in our writing have also come under much scrutiny as we try to make our language less sexist in nature. Although many people believe that these attempts to legislate equality through language are ludicrous, they have had some effect as seen in the response of a 7-yearold girl when she was asked one of the fundamental questions about our future, "Can man survive?" She replied, "I don't know about him, but we're working on it in Brownies."

Nilsen (1972) talks ahout several sexist areas of the English lexicon. Eponyms (words derived from names of people) are almost all male names. The few exceptions are those that refer to the body or to clothes (bloomer, Mae West jacket). Male and female terms reflect sexist attitudes (bachelor vs. old maid, tailor vs. seamstress). Unless they are rebels or crusaders, women are often referred to in terms of their relation to men (Mrs. John Brown, sister of). Interestingly, girls can have boys' names (Jo, Teri, Toni, Pat) but the reverse seldom happens.

Claims have been made that women and men use different words. For example, women are much more likely than men to use specific color terms like ecru, lavender, and beige. Women use let's more often than men to encourage cooperative action, whereas men use more direct demands. In many differences it is not clear whether the choices should be attributed to a difference in status and power or to differences in the gender Of the speakers.

In some languages, the choice of terms differs much more according to the gender of the speaker. For example, in some languages men are expected to learn to use different forms of words once they reach puberty. In some languages (see Dixon's descriptions of the Dyirbal language of Australia), there are special terms that are to be used when addressing one's mother-in-law. Haviland (1979) writes about specia) lexical choices used in Yimidhur when addressing the parents and brothers of one's wife.

It is not difficult to understand why particular terms are used in such cases, but in other languages the choice of terms does not seem to have any special function (aside from social bonding). They have evoived through custom. There is nothing special about such terms as pretty or handsome that would account for our choice of one over the other in describing a female or male.

# Practice 13.2

1. Although it is popular to talk about sexist terms, we seldom think about terms that show our views of the elderly. For each of the following pejorative terms that refer to older women, supply an endearing (or trivializing) animal term for a young wornan: old bat, old biddy, battle-ax, henpeck, catty. What is an oldie, geezer, old fogey? How many positive terms can you think of that refer to older men or women? Have you noticed that we talk about "grandfatherly advice" but we sometimes cal the advice of grandmothers "old wives' tales'? A recent newspaper column talked about a hospital as helping people of all ages, \*children, adolescents, adults, and geriatrics." Is geriatrics an age term? It so, can we call young children pediatrics?   
2. In another language of your choice, list terms for older women and men. Are they similar to the English terms from item 1? Compare your results to those of your colleagues. In which languages have you found the most positive terms for the elderly and in which have you found more negative terms?   
3. The terms that we use to talk about men and women are, in a sense, linked to metaphor. We talk about peoples as objects (old battle-ax), as food (dish, peach, tomato. sugar), as animals (cat, chick, stag, fox). Note that most of the examples given here are for women. How many examples can you think ot for men that fit inta these categories and how do these link to the metaphors discussed in Chapter 4?   
4. Kramerae (1981), Thome and Henley (1975), Berryman and Eman (1980), and Locating Power: Proceedings of the 1992 Berkeley Women and Language Conference are good sources to begin researching how women and men speak and differences in the ways we speak about women and men. Tannen (1990) contains useful summaries of research on the differences in language of men and women

(and of boys and girls). Scan these sources and report an interesting finding to your class. Should this piece of information be presented to a language class? If so, when might it best be presented?

5. Visitors to the United States are sometimes surprised to hear themselves referred to as "you guys" regardless of whether they are male or female. During closing remarks at the TESOL Summer Institute, we told students, "We love you guys, we'll miss you guys." Afterward, students asked if this was correct English. Is \*you guys" a typical informal "you all" for all areas of the English-speaking world? Why do you suppose \*you gals" is not much used even in colloquial, informal exchanges?

6. Lexical choices of men and women in academic and technical writing are supposedly very similar. Collect a set of essays written on academic topics by your students (or your classmates). Compare the lexioal choices made by males and temales. Do your findings show academic writing as more standardized in this regard?

7. How important is it to teach or to learn the differences in lexical choice typical of men and women? Give examples to justify your answer. If this topic interests you, examine your language textbooks to determine whether differences are made explicit. You might also want to read Hartman and Judd (1978) for a review of ESL texts to assess the images of women and men presented to students.

# Age

We have already talked about the ways in which meanings of words change and shift over time. Even within a generation, we see many differences in the ways that particular lexical items are used. In the 1940s and 1950s, people were square, in the groove, or keen. The 1960s terms were groovy and cool. In the 1980s and early 1990s teenagers used the terms rad, awesome, and totally. (Totally was only used ironically per. haps because it was used primarily by teenage girls, not boys. Totally tubular, however, seems to be used by both. Is tubular, meaning good, related to the old fear of being square, which was definitely not good?) Current slang has probably changed again. Every few years, it becomes important to separate ourselves from each other, and one way of doing that is through lexica! choice. In the 1960s, teenagers were quite irate if their parents said groovy, and today they feel the same way when their parents say something is down (meaning great) or bad (meaning good). If you are not a member of the group, such words are not appropriare choices. By using them, you are trying to claim membership in that social group.

Much of slang is limited to words of evaluation (e.g., cool, keen, awesome), words that refer to people in an evaluative ways (e.g., nerd, square), or to school life (e.g., names of classes and dorms). The lexical choice of people of different ages is not limited to such terms. One generation taiks about women friends as ladies, and the next talks about them as women. One generation invites friends over for coffee (which includes all sorts of cookies, cakes, and sandwiches), and the next asks friends to stop by or drop by (and they'll be lucky to get much of anything to eat!). Members of one generation may still call the frig an icebox, though it now has an icemaker rather than a block of ice in it. The record player may still be called a record player even though it now plays only CDs.

Like the various terms for pancakes in areas of Pennsylvania that had been influenced by German, other food terms are also markers of both differences in age and geographic area. N. Bruce says that her mother and grandmother used the terms flapjacks, griddle cakes, and johnny cakes (made with corn meal). Journeys cake were johnny cakes taken to schoo! in a lunchpail for school lunch. These members of the older generation also use commence (for begin in such phrases as "commence to dance," "commence to clean up the room." Commence now seems much too formal a rerm to be used in this way.

If we look back over time, written records show that lexical choicc and collocations differ from generation to generation. Here are some example sentences taken from Ho for California! Women's Overland Diaries (Myres, 1980).

1. Laid by on account of Mrs. C. being sick.   
2. All well this morning and fixing to move on.   
3. The oxen would hardly any of them drink the water.   
4. We walked back to our wagons and was ready for starting when the balance came up.   
$5$ . Some of the teams came near upsetting the wagons.   
6. We got 28 head of cattle drowned in the Hondo and we came very near getting some of our oxen drowned. One wagon slid down and came very near going into the creek.

But nowadays cuitural change seems even more rapid, and this is reflected in our vocabulary choice. Every few years, a newspaper or magazine will run a column headed something like "Were you born before $1 9 4 5 ? \cdots$ followed by a list of changes that have taken place after the selected date. For example, there was no TV, no frozen food, no contact lenses, and no contraceptive pill. It was a time before credit cards, laser beams, and ball-point pens. In the United States, pizza, McDonald's, and instant coffee were unheard of. It was before day care centers, group therapy, fax machines, artificial hearts, and personal computers. Cigarette smoking was fashionable then, grass was mowed, pot was something you cooked in, rock music was grandma's lullaby, and nobody had walked on the moon. These are new for people born before 1945, so the vocabulary has changed in a very short time. Some people think this is why we suffer a generation gap every few years!

3. The slang of various occupational or recreational groups helps to make the group cohesive and it aiso varies across generations. Current motorcycle racers have special words that might be meaningless to nonracers and even to racers of another era if it were not for context. For examp!e the expression under the paint means to get as close to the motorcycle as possible to reduce wind resistance, as in "Get under the paint when you take those curves." A few years ago a racer might have said "tuck in." Most people would recognize the word bite to talk about tire traction, but in motorcycle circles they may say hook up as in It was hooking up real good until the rear tire slid out." Traffic is a very common word but it is currently used by speed fanatics to refer to slow motorcycles, as in "I was making time until they got me going through traffic." Select a special tield and research the current slang. Ask the people who use the terms to tell you why they use these particular words rather than some of the older equivalents.

5. In Chapter 1 we talked about the use of less versus fewer with mass and count nouns (e.g., "less noise" and "fewer cars"). However, people often use fess with count nouns. In a radio interview, a speaker talked about the decline in the number of art galleries, saying there are 'less galleries" now than five years ago. We are also all familiar with supermarket checkout line signs reading "10 items or less.' Do you think the language is changing so that less will replace fewer? If native speakers use less for fewer, should we still be concerned if language learners do not distinguish between the forms? Justify your answer.

# Occupation

Special lexical items appear in most professions, and every field has special vocabulary to cover abstract concepts. For example, we have talked about morphology in ways that a biologist, whose field also uses this word, would find puzzling. Linguists use many terms also used by mathematicians (beta, parameters) in ways that no mathematician would recognize.

Danet (1985) lisrs some of the major lexical differences in legalese. Some are technical terms (real property, forfeiture), some are terms that have different meanings from those usually used (assignment, title), and some are archaic (herein, thereof, aforesaid). Legal writing also uses doublets ("cease and desist') and is more formal in register ("shall include," "does hereby convey," "assign and appoint").

The writings in many fields can be identified (even if one only sees a fragment of the writing) by such lexical choices. In some fields there are special dictionaries to help novices learn the special vocabulary. Mellinkoff (1991), for example, published a special legal dictionary that presents legal concepts in easily understood English. Sarcevic (1989) claims that legal concepts are bound to a particular national legal system and culture. French legal systems differ from Islamic law and from English law, so terms are not easily translated. For example, the French word dettes refers to both paid or unpaid debts, quite different from English debts. Sarcevie argues that specialist dictionaries for bilinguals should be based on conceptual analysis.

Terms within a field change over time as new terms become more fashionable. For example, in language acquisition, we used to talk about whether a child was prepared (or ready) to learn something in terms of having acquired a foundation for the next step in the learning process. When Vygotsky's ideas about education became well known, this next step became the zone of proximal development. When Krashen re introduced the concept, it became i plus one. In composition teaching, we used to talk about an author's point of view but now we talk about it as stance. The jargon of fields change and if we do not know the current buzz words, we feel left out. We also demonstrate our lack of "currency" in the field.

The jargon of a field allows members to talk about concepts with useful shorthand forms, but it also establishes membership. If you don't know the words, you don't belong. Perhaps this is one reason why our students are often loath to ask us what we mean when we use some term. To admit that they do not know is to place themselves outside the group; they don't belong. For that reason, if no other, we should try to remember what it was like when we first encountered the subject matter that we teach -- which words were not clear and need to be defined anew each time we teach a particular course.

They found that Mel'tuk's relational model was very useful in helping to define the technical vocabulary. They list sets of words with the relation (in caps) such as cerebetlum PART brain, artery TAX blood vessel, aphasia DYSFUNCT speech, admission CONVERSE release. They also tound lexical phrases such as "doll head ma

neuver." If you teach English for science, could you organize the technical vocabulary using the relational model? If so, would these groupings be usefut for your students as well? It you are not sure how usetul they would be with students, how might you research this question?

4. The jargon of a particular field may also change over time to show membership in either a very select group or to distinguish the jargon of a tield in a particular geographic area. A computer technician talks about the futility of "wav. ing a dead chicken." He says this means doing a doomed repair ritual over a crashed computer system. What other computerese examples can you add? Why do you suppose there is so much speciat jargon in this field? In bureaucratic language? In medical language? Which fields change jargon rapidly? Why?

# Education

Literacy also influences the lexical choices available to us. As young children, we often acquire words without knowing exactly what they mean or, in some cases, the exact form of the word. Teachers often collect examples of errors their students make as they begin to use new words. Greene (1969) assembled many of these in a book called Pullet Surprises (the name comes from a student's composition: "In 1957, Eugene O'Neill won a pullet surprise"). Collectibles include such gems as, "Neptune is always pictured with his strident," "The doctor said to take milk of amnesia," "My dissent is unknown," and the case of the music student who wrote a paper about "Claude W.C."

The television character Archie Bunker was a master of using big words inaccuratcly. Mrs. Malaprop, in Sheridan's play The Rivals, has given us the word malaprop for this ability. Here are a few malaprops or bunkerisms: "I always said those two was right outta Science Friction," "You're invading the issue," "That man don't have one regleaming feature," "It's a proven fact that capital punishment is a known detergent to crime." (Are the words bunkerisms and malaprops eponyms?)

It is difficult to know whether the mistakes we make in homophones (words that are pronounced the same but have a different spelling) are slips or not. Teachers in elementary school are forever pointing out the difference between there and their, but many of us still type one when we mean the other. Copy editors at newspapers allow many of these to slip through (e.g., in a review of a novel - "his books have also peaked an interest"; in a recipe -- "kneed the bread dough"; in an ad -- "have your hair quaffed in this breezy style"; and in a popular column -- "we were offered a free desert if we weren't served in ten minutes." Public scorn greets such errors (for the latter example, "would you select the Mojave, the Sahara, or what?"); the paper, the writers, and the copy editors get their just desert.

Even when we succeed in learning to use words appropriately, we may still use certain terms in a way that reflects educational level. You may remember your teacher's admonitions and the many exercises you were required to do to distinguish lie from lay and set from sit. In addition to many other grammar rules, we were cautioned never to say "he ain't" for "he isn't" and to always use correct participles such as has gone rather than has went. English teachers prided themselves in banishing these uneducated forms from our writing and talk. Yet, our brothers and their friends continued to say "has went" whenever they were beyond the listening ears of teachers, parents, and sisters. That is, these were hallowed parts of the dialect shared especially by the boys in many areas of the country. For boys, to say "has gone" would be to disown their social group. For girls, correctness seemed more important, so we dutifully produced nondialect forms as soon as we were told that these were, indeed, the forms used hy educated speakers of the language.

2. Many second language learners believe that the distinction between who and whom is extremely important. Others feel that it may be important in formal, written English but is not used in the spoken language. Others never use whom. Trace the change in use of whom: at what point did whom begin to disappear from the language? How important is it that this form be retained? Editors almost always change which's to that's. What is the "rule" for use of which and that? How important is it that this convention be followed?

3. The appointment secretary at our doctor's office says, "Whom may I say is calling?" if a caller asks to speak to the doctor. How do you account for such "errors"'?

ples of homonym errors. Ask native speakers and language learners to locate the errors in your examples. Are learners more aware of homonyms than native speakers? How might you research this question in more detail? 5. Some of the "pullet surprises" in Greene's book are similar to Archie Bunker's errors, used in place of words that have sound similarities. Supply the correct word for each of the following teenage malaprops:

a. Every state is permitted to send two centaurs to Congress.   
b. The tycoon raged across the island for two days   
c. She is surreptitious about black cats.   
d. One nation under God, indivisible, with levity and justice for all.   
e. He drives a red Chivalry.

# Group and individual choices

As individuals, each of us takes on a variety of roles. As our roles vary, and as we interact with other people, we change the lexical irems we choose. We listen and unconsciously adjust to the language of those around us. When we move from one area of the country to another, we may find that we say pail instead of bucket. When we talk with people who are not linguists or language educators, we don't use such terms as morphology or parameters. But more important than that, we negotiate meaning in our interactions, selecting words that fit each interaction so that the outcome is one with which we feel comfortable. The range of choices we have to do that depends, at least to some extent, on our experiences, our reading, and our education.

When biases are shared across a membership group, we scarcely notice that choices have been made. For example, President Clinton was described as the next leader of the nation, our party leader, a demagogue, and a bozo during the 1992 campaign. The choice of term depends on both the setting and on political bias. When a company talks about development, environmentalists may hear it as exploitation. When a candidate talks about his program as time tested, a rival candidate may say it is out of date. Some political candidates see change as progressive, whereas others see it as crackpot extremism.

Biases are also shared in membership groups regarding what words are or are not taboo. Names of body parts are often taboo. It used to be taboo to mention the word Ieg in polite EngJish conversation, even when you only meant the leg of a chicken. When the television commentator Ted Koppel told tennis legend Jimmy Connors that he brought hope "to every old fart in the country," everyone was aghast. In some cultures, it is quite appropriate to talk explicitly about organs involved in illness. In others it is not. In some languages, it is taboo to mention certain people by name. For example, a male Cree speaker, out of respect, does not speak the names of his sisters.

We often create new expressions when old words, while not taboo, might offend someone. For example, we may call a garbage man a sanitation engineer, or worry about a friend's facial blemishes rather than talk about pimples. This week our home improvement store has a sign saying that applications for lot engineers are being accepted. One hardly needs a degree in engineering to help people load and unload carts in a parking Iot! Euphemisms are common in sales. A salesperson for carpet cleaning said he got more business if he told prospective customers that their carpets were heavily soiled. If he told them that their rugs were dirty, he almost always lost the sale. Consumer's Guide suggests that people wanting to sell their houses should call them homes and that they should list lots for sale as home sites.

Emotional reactions to words can be individual rather than societal. All of us are irritated by certain expressions. Sometimes that irritation is shared by others (as in the case of badly) and sometimes it is not. We may hate to hear people say orientate rather than orient or summarization rather than summary. We may dislike the word reduplication when duplication seems adequate. These may drive us crazy while we take special delight in finding duplications that use two languages (the Los Angeles Angels, La Brea Tar Pits, beautiful Hermosa Beach, the beach at Playa del Rey, La Puente bridge, or even pizza pie). And redundant phrases such as \*the reason why is because" may also be a favorite part of Our lexicon.

The popular writer Edwin Newman (1978) dislikes redundancy. Why, he asks, would something unique need to be singularly unique. He quotes President Carter as having said that a decision on a meeting time had to be made jointly by Russians and Americans. For Carter, this was a \*mutual decision between us." Newman also dislikes collocations that conflict. These are called oxymorons. He cites a weatherman who is fond of saying the temperature will "gradually plummet."

Newman isn't alone in his concern with popular word choice. Rosen (1977), writing about \*psychobabble," is especially insulted by the use of the word freak to mean a commitment or highly developed interest (as in Jesus freak, music freak, or computer freak). He objects that this is akin to calling a career one's chosen perversion or stimulant.

Many writers see euphemisms ("telling it like it isn't") as not only Judicrous but sinister. They see such phrases as cost overruns or junior executive as worse than misleading. They believe euphemisms show a fear to speak straight out or an effort to hide something. Although many of us use such forms out of consideration for the feelings of others, others see it as the corrosion of society. The campaign against euphemism is similar to that waged against cliches in the past. Cliches, it was claimed, covered up the fact that we had nothing to say. We should strive to find words that will convey our meanings clearly and concisely. Our word choice should, as Newman says, be "eloquent where possible, playful where possible, and personal so that we do not all sound alike." Our individual lexical choices allow us to do that.

3. The word politician can be elevated to statesman. Give an elevated word tor each of the tollowing terms: haggle, snoop, cheap (person), wastetul (person).   
4. Time-tested can be downgraded to out of style. Give a downgraded word for each of the following terms: progressive, chic, meticulous, leader of the nation. A TV commercial for Cadillac cars mentions leather seating areas and gold ornamentation. What is the neutral term for each? How could the neutral term be downgraded? As you listen to a commercial, jot down the upgraded and downgraded terms. How might each influence a potential customer?   
5. In space exploration jargon, failures are called partial successes, errors are malfunctions. When experiments fail, it is said that "the quality of results are expected to be downgraded." The names of space craft (Jupiter, Saturn) not only suggest space but also god-like infallability. Military jargon also assigns names such as Desert Storm to mititary operations. What difference would it make if we called the space craft by less "powerful" or \*lucky" names? What similar terms can you find in science and govern

ment? Are these same terms used presenting the news about these items in other languages?

6. Allen and Burridge (1991) note that we should research when and by whom euphemisms are not used. Select two euphemisns and determine when you would and would not use them. Check your intuitions against the responses of five other native or nonnative speakers.

# Formality

The title of Joos's (1961) Five Clocks comes from a joke told about the Ballyhough railway station which had two clocks which disagreed by some six minutes. When a helpful traveler pointed this out to a porter, he replied, \*Faith, sir, if they was to tell the same time, why would we be having two of them?" Joos decided that we have more than two choices in language. He identified five styles, five "clocks": frozen, formal, consultative, casual, and intimate. We use the consultative style in talking with strangers. In such discourse, we do not expect that all information is shared, so background information must be supplied and vocabulary is more carefully chosen. We use the casual style with friends and acquaintances who share more information with us. When we use this style to address a stranger, we signal that the person is like a friend or acquaintance. Intimate style is the language of intimate friends and the language within the family. Formal style detaches the speaker from the hearer, and frozen style, according to Joos, is the register used in print or declamation.

In Los Angeles, it is common to use casual style with strangers. In other parts of the country, consultative style is more normally used with strangers. Newcomers who move from one area to another often react quite negatively to the shift in registers. For example, a friend who moved from Los Angeles to Rochester, New York, at first thought everyone was very unfriendly. As a linguist, however, he began to notice that it was not unfriendliness but that everyone used a more formal register (while he was still using a casual style).

Beyond Joos's five levels of style, translation specialists identify much finer levels by trying to match the degree of formality, language simplicity or complexity, and emotional tone. Newmark (1988) trains translators to become sensitive to eight levels of formality:

Level Officialese

# Example

Official

The consumption of any nutrients whatsoever is categorically prohibited in this establishment. The consumption of nutrients is prohibited in this establishment.

# Formal

You are requested not to consume food in this establishment.

Neutral Eating is not allowed here.   
Informal Please don't eat here.   
Colloquial You can't feed your face here.   
Slang Lay off the nosh! Taboo Lay off the f- - nosh.

(Newmark, 1988, p. 14)

He also expects translators to match the simplicity or complexity of the original passage in the translation. This scale has six levels: simple, popu. lar, neutral, educated, rechnical, and opaque technical. Newmark's sentence for the simple level is "The floor of the sea is covered with rows of big mountains and deep pits." This sentence on the popular level is \*The floor of the sea is covered with great mountain chains and deep trenches."

The third scale is emotional tone and has four leveis: intense, warm, cool or factual, and cold understatement. Intense tone exhibits profuse use of intensifiers (absolutely wonderful, enormously successful). Warm tone is exemplified by such terms as gentle, soft, heart-warming melodies. Cool or factual tone is shown in such terms as significant, personable, and considerable. An example of cold understatement is not undignified. Newmark believes that a good translator will be able to match the original and the transiation on each of these register or style scales.

Many linguists prefer to talk about style and formality in terms of the differences between oral and written language. If we choose the same words and phrases in speaking as we do in writing, we sound stuffy, pompous, opinionated, or preachy. This is because much of meaning is negotiated in face-to-face interaction. When we do not negotiate the interaction, we sound like someone giving a lecture. On the other hand, if we use the lexical choices for speech in written work, readers often feel the choices are inappropriate.

A second way to examine lexical choice is the unplanned-planned dichotomy. That is, the writing in journals or diaries is likely to share characteristics with talk, and a formal oral presentation in front of an audience shares the characteristics of written language. The difference is in the amount of planning and revision we do rather than in a strict talkversus-writing dichotomy. Written or planned language has special characteristics, as does the language of spontaneous talk and unrevised, unplanned writing. In spontaneous talk, words and phrases are repeated, and words seem to touch off the use of words having similar sound sequences. In the following two examples, a client is talking to a psychologist on a radio call-in show.

# Example A

C: CL nn I find this is a wonderful way to keep your weight down.

Example B

C: You-you should be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize $^ { + }$ you're so marvelous $^ +$ you cause more peace in people's lives than $^ { + }$ any person I'm sure.

In written text, we try to use parallelism while avoiding too much repetition or too many sound touch-offs. In polishing text, we avoid repetition, searching for appropriate synonyms. The problem is to find synonyms that are appropriate, that match the level of formality of the text. This is a problem for both technical writers and journalists. For example, in writing columns about current issues, reporters cannot continually use the word issues. Rather, they must alternate it with problems, concerns, difficulties, and so forth. They cannot select a synonym from an informal register such as bummer or screw-up. When teaching writing to young children, we continually ask them to supply appropriate synonyms in revising their writing. The importance of working on synonyms for text purposes, however, seems to be a forgotten skill in most second and foreign language teaching.

We have noted in several chapters that synonyms are difficult for learners because each synonym may have different collocations. These colocations are confounded or nested within differences in style and formality. In turn, the style or formality is determined by the script within which we are communicating. To illustrate this overlap, consider Paimer's (1976) five types of synonym relations, each of which might contribute to problems in language learning. Palmer calls differences in formality the register relation. He shows this with examples such as 'orrible stink, nasty smell, and obnoxious effluvium. Collocation relations also contribute to difficulty. His examples for spoiled are rancid, which collocates with butter, and addled, which collocates with eggs. Palmer's third synonym relation, connotation, is seen in examples like thrifty and stingy. Palmer's fourth category, synonyms that vary across dialects (autumn versus $f a ( l )$ , may also be confusing for learners. The fifth category consists of partial synonyms like promise and pledge.

Although it is possible to categorize synonyms in this way, both the situation and the people with whom we interact in the situation set the types of collocations, types of connotations, dialect forms, and choices among partial synonyms. We use special expressions as comments about our choice of register. For example, if we want to introduce a novel term or item from another register into our discourse and get away with it, we need to comment on the register shift with expressions such as: \*as they say," "so they say," "as it were," "so to speak," "in a manner of speaking," "so-called," "if you like." Without special marking, a shift in register has consequences for the social interaction.

In face-to-face communication, we can monitor how well our message

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

is being understood and appreciated. We can change our lexical choices to make our claims stronger or weaker depending on how the interaction seems to unfold. We can modulate our statements with laughter or disfluencies (umm, well, uhh) or such expressions as kinda, sorta. In writing, we cannot say, "Oh, 1 didn't mean it that way" or " Well, maybe that is a bit strong," to our readers. So we use hedges, which may be changes in verb selection like seems, suggests, or appears rather than is, or the addition of qualifiers like somewbat, rather, or possibly. These supplement modals (can, may, might, and so forth) in weakening or strengthening the claims we make. Searching the text of this chapter for modals, you will find many that weaken claims. For example, in discussing the words for pancakes in the first section, we wrote that everyone there may say pancakes, rather than everyone there says pancakes, because we don't really want to be held responsible for that claim. You might go to Pennsylvania and find people who still say flannel cakes.

Modals are, of course, used in both spontaneous talk and in polished writing. Some writing programs urge that we eliminate all other "weasel words." However, this ignores the important discourse function that modality serves. Modality, in addition to marking our degree of certainty or the degree of possibility of the truth of statements and our attitudes of volition, permission, and obligation, is also used to establish connectedness and autonomy in face-to-face interaction or in interaction with our readers. The more distance we want to create, the more formal our choices and the more neutral and unmodulated our lexical choices. The more connectedness we hope to establish, the closer the match must be among the participants. When the match is off, we can modulate our language with the use of these special lexical markers.

As learners we want to know how to use modality and how to modify lexical choices in discourse contexts that vary from spontaneous oral interactions to that of technical writing. When we are learning a language and are exposed to a variety of registers or styles, the range of choices becomes confusing. Both first and second language learners have to learn the more formal register of academic writing, and they often begin by using language which is considered too casual. Even international students who are advanced learners occasionally use oral language expressions in formal writing.

Anyway our country have many problem seriously. But ten years ago you Rnow we still a developing country.

Register differences and the use of modality to establish connectedness and autonomy are important in teaching vocabulary skills to learners at all levels.

# Practice 13.7

1. Newmark (1988) says that student translators tend to use colloquial rather than intormal style. Thus, they translate de plus en plus as "more and more" rather than "increasingly." Surtout is translated as "above all" rather than "particularly." In the following pairs, identify which is informal and which colloquial: job-work, recovered--got well, lots of-numerous, escape-get out of, get rid of-discard.

2. One measure of formality is said to be the preference for primarily Latinate rather than Germanic words in formal English text. Word frequency is also believed to differentiate formal and intormal registers. Slang, too, is a signal of informal register. Levin and Novak (1991) asked university students to read sets of utterances and choose a probable listener (e.g., close friend, brother, sister, employer, professor, stranger). The utterances with primarily Germanic words and those with slang were thought to be informal, appropriate for triends, and the Latinate versions formal and therefore appropriate for use with strangers or persons of higher status. Here is one set from the study:

agree with those of Levin and Novak's native speakers? Supply variants that are rnore and less tormal for this (+Germanic, high frequency) sentence fron the study: "The government cannot do everything; people must help themselves." What makes your different versions more or less formal?

3. Now that several thesaurus software programs are available, language learners have a ready source of synonyms and antonyms to consult as they write their compositions. How might you use a cornputer thesaurus in teaching a composition course? How does the thesaurus show choices for informal or formal registers? Is enough information given in the thesaurus so that students can select needed synonyms (or antonyms) for words used in their initial drafts?

4. The COBUILD dictionary detines as it were as "to make what you are saying sound less definite." Does this seem right to you? Can it also be used to show that you do not wish to identify yourself with a claim or with those who make it (especially the way they make the claim)? Do you think that as they say shows a willingness to identify with the claim or those who make it? Do you think that these phrases show a shift in register? How might you gather evidence to support your answer?

5. In this section, we said that modality differs in formal and informal (written versus oral and planned versus unplanned) contexts. Modality across registers, however, may not be the same for all languages. In English, for example, we use want or want to as modals that make requests more polite. We might say, "Do you want to shut the door on your way out?" to make the request less direct, or we might invite someone to join us with, \*Do you want a cup of coffee?" Kato (1989) lists the Japanese word tai for want, but points out that it is not used in this way. Because the speaker should always consider the wants of the hearer, it is not polite in Japanese to ask if he or she wants something. So a Japanese person might invite one to join by asking, "Do you drink coffee?" Give examples of your own that show a contrast in use of modality to soften or strenthen requests in another language. Is the equivalent of want used in a way similar to English or to Japanese?

# Research and application

Geographic differences

1. Anson (l990) notes that the dictionary spellings of words are not consistent (2,000 words were shown to have variant spellings). Some of these are usually attributed to differences in British and American spelling. Anson conducted a case study of spelling of -our words (honour, honor, colour, color) in the two dialects. Contrary to expectation, the spelling of these words has varied since 1200 in British English. In addition, the u is dropped in derivations of the words in British spelling (the Oxford University Dictionary lists humour, humorist, humorous, and humourless). Read Anson's article and check your spelling of the words listed in this group and other variant spellings which are thought to differ in British and American Englisn.

2. Bryant (l99l) outlines the initial data collection, verification, and final survey stages of an Australian Enghish survey. Words in nineteen categories were elicited: birds, fish, animals, plants, school, children's activities, houses, food, clothing, personal items, housenold items, vehicles, rural terms, occupation, weather, roads and roadsides, geographic features, business and services, and miscellaneous. If you wished to conduct a survey of Ll lexical items used by an immigrant population, would you select a few items from each category or would you concentrate on orly a few categories and ehicit more terms? Justify your choice and prepare a list of items and a method for obtaining the data.

3. Pride (1982) and Trudgill and Chambers (1991) contain chapters on the English spoken around the world, and give information on variation across dialects of English for articles and pronouns, modals and the verb system, and adverbials. Cheshire (199l) gives English variants by area (the Pacific, West Africa, and so forth). Select one geographic area and comment on the lexical variation that would be important for a language teacher to be aware of. and how that awareness might influence the teacher's work.

4. Corson (199l) looked for area (England and Australia) and social class differences in passive vocabulary. Subjects were given fortynine words and a key word suggesting the semantic field relevant to each target word. They were asked to form a sentence with each pair of words. Corson found no differences in word use between the two countries but did find differences across social classes. Review the methodology and materials used in the study. What adaptations world you make if you wished to replicate this study with other dialects, social or ethnic groups?

# Social group differences

5. There are many dictionaries of American slang, which may, however, be specific to a particular social group. Check several entries in a general dictionary of slang against a more current or specific list (e.g., Munroe's 199l dictionary of UCLA slang). What can such collections tell us about variation in lexical selection?   
6. Shorrocks (l99l) suggests that the terminology of fishing might usefully be elicited to investigate sociolinguistic variation. The subcategories would include words for tackle (leads, floats), water (creek, reservoir), bait (spinners, worms), activities (casting, gutting), fish (terms for stages of growth, esteem), natural phenomena (beach, tide), manmade phenomena (pier, canal), and sayings and proverbs. Could you collect data from TV programs on the joys of fishing? If not, what methods might you use to ehicit such vocabulary? What languages, dialects and sociolinguistic variables would you want to include in the study? why should fishing be a better choice than skiing, golfing. or other hobbies in investigating sociolinguistic variation? If you carry out this research, you might send it to Language in Society for possible publication.   
7. Osgood (l978) discusses the talk of advertising and pohtics. Much of military jargon, he says, is designed to dehumanize and thus protect us from feeling moral qualms. He also lists pairs of terms used in international relations: (exploit vs. aid, manipulate vs. advise, dominate vs. submif to, Jead vs. follow, help vs. hinder, protect vs. attack). He claims that in these fields, speakers use incantations such as "the right to self-determination," spells such as "we have a commitment," contagious magic such as "a threat to freedom in Asia, is a threat to freedom in Pearblossoin, USA," and analogic magic as in "another Munich." These phrases becorme almost as vacuous and dissipated as terms such as socialisin, capitalism, democracy. Although this article is more than 15 years old, it seems very current. If you are interested in the language of politics, the military, advertising, or other career groups, you might wish to use this article as a classic in related literature.

# Formality and oral/written mode

8. In Practice l0.2, we noted that claims have been made that verbs of Greco-Latin origin are used in more formal or technical language. The pairs begin-commence, and end-terminate are synonyms that differ in formality. Check the verbs in your own academic writing. Do you select Greco-Latinate words over AngloSaxon equivalents? You might want to replicate Levin and Novak's study on formality (Practice 13.7.2) with second language learners to see whether they pick the same audience for each of the utterance types. (Levin and Novak list the utterances used for the study in their appendix.)

9. Myers (199l) compared the types of lexical cohesion used in science materials written for scientists and those in popular science articles. Differences were found in use of synonyms, oppositions (antonyms, converses, and contrasting members of a taxonomy). and superordinates. Because the texts are all from the fields of science, it is surprising to find such Iarge differences. Examine the science materials available for an EST (English for Science and Technology) course. Are the techniques for achieving cohesion more like those Myers found for science texts or for popular science materials. Do you think it is important that EST materials match those of science? If you survey several sets of materials, you might prepare an article on the importance (or lack thereof) of matching materials to those of either science or popular science.

# 14 The vocabulary of communication signals and speech acts

We noted earlier that single words and ready-made phrases are used for discourse purposes. In this chapter, we will reorganize that information around two different types of discourse analysis: communication signals and speech acts phrases. In conversation, participants negotiate the interaction together, and the result is a conversation. Yet, for all of our having taken part in thousands of conversations, it would be strange if each one was cntirely original and new. As with scripts, a general template for the conversation is formed along with the stereotypic phrases and lexical items attached to that framework, the vocabulary of communication signals and certain speech acts. Communication requires the use (or variation on the use) of fairly stereotypic sequenccs of words and lexical phrases.

# Communication signals

Goffman (1976) claimed that there are at least the following universal set of communication signals: open/close signals, backchannel signals, turntaking signals, framing signals, nonparticipant constraint signals, and acousticaily adequate interpretable messages following Gricean norms. We will look at the lexical signals used for each of these in turn. The actual words or lexical phrases selected will, of course, vary across languages and according to the sociolinguistic factors discussed in Chapter 13.

# Open/ciose signals

If we were to believe many language textbooks, communication in English begins with "Hello." In real life, however, the lexical signals that we use to open communication differ according to mode (written vs. oral communication), event (party, phone call, group meeting, etc.), the projected length of the communication (conversation in an elevator, meeting in a school hallway, etc.), and the role status of the participants (your mother, your boss, etc.). For example, two men greeted each other across a tennis court with

# The vocabulary of communication signals and speech acts

A: whistles to attract B's attention Yo, Bill.   
B: Heyyy, look who's here! Ready for a little game?

These men happen to be lawyers. It's unlikely that either of them would use such lexical phrases to greet each other in the courtroom.

Think for a moment about the signals you give as you meet a friend in the school entry. Some of these are nonverbal (smiles, gestures, change of walking pace) and others are verbal - either single words (" Morning!") or lexical phrases ("Good morning, Sue, how are you?"). These signals are responded to in kind with matching greetings ("Morning, Great"). A "How are you" or one of its variants ("How's it going") may immediately follow. A neutral reply ("Fine," "Great") allows the participants to move to an optional \*noticing" because it is at this moment that the speakers can comment on anything new and noteworthy or noticeable about the other person or about other topics (such as the weather, the surroundings, last night's ball game). Compliments are often used as noticings and compliments, as we will show later, comprise a small number of lexical phrases.

The signals for telephone conversation openings and closings have been extensively studied in conversational analysis (Schegloff, 1968, Schegloff & Sachs, 1973). In American English, the sequence of predictable lexical phrases consists of summons/answer (S/A), self-identification, greeting, a how-are-you (HAY) sequence, and an optional noticing with its shift to the first topic of conversation. The following examples show lexical phrases for each of these parts. Notice that identification comes from very minimal voice cues and, in this case, Denise hears vowel elongation on Sue's \*hi" greeting as uncertainty and jumps in to give a self-identification.

S/A: Phone rings. S: Hh hello.   
Greet/ID: D: Hi, Sue, S: Hi= D: $=$ It's Denise $\simeq$ S: $\simeq$ ohh HI, Denise.   
HAY: How are you. D: Fine.   
Noticing: S: Hey, I heard about your PR D: Hhhh   
(compliment) S: That's great. D: Thanks.   
Topic: D: Mmm the reason I'm calling you is . . .

Business calls much more typically have self-identification phrases and a prompt for the reason for the call:

S/A:

S/A:

Phone rings.   
S:This is Sue at Edmo; how may I help you? Phone rings.   
S:Kaiser Permanente; how can I route your call?

This immediate request for topic can be disconcerting to someone who is used to the more extended opening sequence of social calls:

Phone rings.

S:This is Sue at Edmo, how may I help you?   
Greet/ID: C: Oh hi. This is JS; I'm with uh Nortex. S: Uhhuh   
HAY: - C: Uhh how are you? S: Fine. How can I help you? C: Uhh I wanted some information on

Nonverbal signals can be used in openings. For example, when you ask a favor of a stranger you may use nonverbal eye contact to open the request and then use a lexical phrase like "Could you please tell me X? to make the request. Or, a verbal call for attention such as "Excuse me" could be used: "Excuse me, but could you X.r After an answer is given, a simple "Thanks" or "Thank you" and "You're welcome" sequence can form the closing.

In phone conversations, single word signals show that we are ready to close the conversation. An exchange of words such as well, so, uh show that each side is ready to stop and a close can be given.

Pre-close:

Close:

E: Okay. so::   
S: Yeah. [slow rate] E: Yeh, so I'il call yuh tomorrow then.   
S: Okay mom, talk to you later.  [normal rate] E: Bye.   
S: Bye.

Having given these preclosing signals, we must use additional expressions like $\alpha _ { \Omega \mathbf { h } }$ wait a minute!" if we suddenly decide we have one more thing to say. The preclosing segment is also the last chance to comment on anything noticeable, so although compliments are much more frequently given at the opening of the conversation, they may also appear in the preclosing segment:

Pre-close: E: Hmm. J: Yeh.

The vocabulary of communication signals and speech acts

# Noticing:

E:  Well, it's been really nice talking with you. Oh, and I meant to tell you I really like that dress.   
J: This?   
E: Yeh, it's just the right color.   
J: Oh thanks.   
E: And thanks again for lunch.   
J: My pleasure. See you soon.   
E: Bye.   
J: Bye.

1. What lexical phrases do you (or another teacher) use to open your class session? Are these lexical phrases or nonverbal signals also appropriate for openings of other meetings?   
2. In what situations might you use the following lexical phrases without any other verbal opening? Are there equivalent phrases in another language that you teach or are learning?

Not many people here yet, hmm? Did you hear the news about X? Wonderful morning, isn't it? How about that game last night! Are you a friend of X's?

3. Is the sequence of lexical phrases in the opening the same in the language you teach as they are in the students' first language?

a. Telephone: summons/answer, identification of speakers, greeting, "how are you" exchange, (noticing), bridge to first topic   
b. Conversations: greeting, how are you exchange, (noticing), bridge   
c. Letters: Time, place, date, identitication of addressee, greeting (Dear June,)   
d. Request openings: Excuse me, could you - (Do you know) where's - ? When - ?   
e. Indirect openings: Whew, it's hot! Where's your dog?   
t.Social "party line" openings: Great food, hmm?   
4. What greetings do you use? Because what we think we do is not always what we actually do, tape-record speakers (or yourself) in a number of situations and identify the actua! lexical items and phrases used.   
5. Select a dialogue trom your language textbook and rewrite it to inc!ude an opening sequence. Be sure the lexical phrases are appropriate for the situational context shown in the dialogue. Depending on the proficiency ot your students, you may or may not want to add a noticing. What lexical phrases did you use? How typical are these phrases as opening signals (i.e., can they be used in many similar contexts)?   
6. In a language that you teach or are learning, what words or phrases do people use as pre-closers to show they are ready to close the communication channel? After the preclosing signals are given, what lexical phrases are used to show that you have thought of something eise and want to stop the closing?   
7. What are the conventional closing phrases in the language selected tor item 5? If you are trapped in a conversation and are in a hurry to leave, what lexical phrases might you use to escape? if your signais are misunderstood or ignored, what do you say?   
8. Using the dialogue trom item 5, add a preclosing and closing sequence. If appropriate for your students, as a variation, have one person trap the other in the situation and have the other escape in a tactful or more direct manner. How appropriate is your new dialogue for your students? What do you hope they will learn as a result of the modified dialogue?   
9. In what situations would you use the following lexical phrases? (is cheerio the name of a cereal or a closing signa! for you?) After you have identified the situations, determine whether there are as many choices for closings and preclosings in another language of your choice. Great talking with you.   
Gotta go now.

Can several of these be used consecutively by a speaker? Can any of them be used by both speakers?

10. What lexical phrases of openings and closings do parents model for their children to ensure they "behave properly"? Do they also model the nonverbal signals that go along with the lexical signals?

# Backchannel signals

In social interaction, we expect that others will want to converse with us and that they will value our contributions to the conversation just as we value theirs. Backchannel signals are one way of showing that this is the case. In American English, common backchannel signals such as mmbmm, uhhuh, yeh, and right, show that we not only hear and are listening to the message but are activcly engaged in the interaction.

If we withhold backchannel signals, the speaker assumes that we are not listening, that we are borcd, or that we disagree with the message. The talk of the speaker is tined to leave spaces during which we are expected to offer a reassuring backchannel signal. If you try, you will find it is very difficult to withhold backchannel signals during these pauses. When the speaker does not receive assurance during that pause, he or she is likely to try to fix up the trouble, sometimes even by reversing a claim.

E: I really don't like it. {.8 pause) (no backchannel offered) I mean - well, it's not so:: bad, I guess.

Or, the speaker may ask for feedback (e.g., "Does this make sense?" \*Do you understand?" "Are you listening?").

The form and frequency of backchannel signals varies from group to group. It has been clained that women give more supporting and encouraging backchannel signals than nen. Because backchannel signals are so automatic, it is not surprising to find that we use the signals from our first language when speaking in other languages. Tao and Thompson (1991) give examples where fluent English-Mandarin bilinguals use aha, um, yeah, uhhuh when speaking Mandarin instead of the Mandarin ao, a, ei, duilshi.

When we use lexica! items from the appropriate language, signals which seem to us to be acceptable and positive signs of encouragement, we or our conversational partners can still be in for a surprise. For example, it is a custom in many academic departments to welcome international guests by giving a short description of the department's program. The chair of one such department began to do this and the international visitor nodded and said, "interesting, interesting," as a backchannel. The chair, taken aback by a signal which, because of the intonation sounded equivalent to "boring, boring," quickly switched to another topic, offering to take the guest for a walk around the campus. The guest, looking somewhat puzzled, reluctantly agreed and then asked a question about the program.

In the classroom, teachers expect students to give them backchannel signals to show that they understand and that they find the lesson interesting or that they don't understand or that they find the lesson not worth ther participation. These may be nonverbal signals (such as nods and smiles or movements of thc hands and shifts in body position). When students fail to give positive backchannels, we may rephrase our message or we may make an appeal for attention (e.g., "Listen now, this is important!"). In ordinary conversations we are unlikely to tell our conversational partners to pay attention because we assume the people we talk with are interested in what we have to say. If we drift off as others speak and it is noticed, we are embarrassed and may need to offer an apology.

# Practice 14.2

1. The backchannel signals you use may vary depending on many factors, among them the dialect ot English you speak and your relationship with the other speaker. Check the tape that you recorded tor Practice 14.1.4. What backchannel signals do the speakers use?   
2. What are the words or phrases used as backchannel signals in the languages you teach or are leaming? How do they vary (conversations, in class, at a performance)? What nonverbal signals are used? Are these signals presented in your language textbook?   
3. What backchannel signals do teachers use in the classroom? Are different signals used to encourage boys and girls? Does the frequency of backchannel signals differ for girls? Are there differences in the frequency or form of backchannel signals directed toward adult students?   
4. Do you or your students use L1 signals rather than the target language signals? Are the signals used with appropriate frequency?   
5. When students or conversational partners do not appear to be listening, how do you respond? When would someone respond to negative backchanneling with lexical phrases such as:   
Am I boring you?   
Hello, hello? (waves hand in front of partner's face) Any. body in there?

# The vocabulary of communication signals and speech acts

You're not listening, are you? Listen up, you guys!

6. Add a series of backchannel signals to the dialogue in Practice 14.1.5. Note how this shifts the amount of talk for the students. How can you tix the imbalance?   
7. Plan an activity where your students tell you expressions people use as positive and negative backchannel signals. Next, ask them for phrases they might use in response to negative backchannel signals. Write these on the board and then have thern divide the list into those that are and are not polite (or those they can use with anyone and those to be used only with people they know). Can some be used with both? Be prepared to tell them the phrases that can be used as a response (usually an apology) when Others tell us, nowever politely, to pay attention.

# Turn-taking signals

Ideally, the turns in a conversation are symmetric. One person or the other does not dominate without permission. There are lexical phrases that must be used to gain permission for a very long turn. The child's "You know what?" and our answering "No, what?" gets the necessary permission for an extended monologue. Adults may use such lexical phrases as, "You'll never believe what just happened" for this same purpose.

Turn-taking signals may be very subtle when the speakers know each other. The rhythm of the conversation is quickly set and each person comes in on cue according to that rhythm. One speaker cues the end of a turn by using falling intonation, stretching final vowels, or using such nonverbal signals as arm and head movements or body shifts. The gap between turns is perfectly timed if the speakers are in sync.

When there is unequal power between speakers or when one speaker is reticent and the other begins "directing," turns may be passed by asking a question (e.g., \*So what do you think?"). The classroom is one example of unequal power discourse. The teacher controls the turns, allocating them by calling on students and responding to their answers in questionanswer-evaluation sequences. The turns bounce back and forth to the teacher. In language classrooms, teachers are trained to change this natural pattern. They encourage students to call on each other and to ask each other questions, or they may use chain drilis where each person responds in turn and then asks a question of the next student.

There are languages where it is quite all right to overlap turns by chiming in. These overlaps where each person is saying basically the same thing to end a turn are called collaborative completions. In other lan

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

guage or social groups, collaborating on the completion of a turn is seen not as a mark of friendship and support but rather as exceedingly rude. In some language groups, it is quite permissible to allow a long gap before responding. This is not seen as a silent signal that something is wrong in the communication, but rather that the conversation is so important that the speaker wants to take time before responding. You can imagine the problems mismatches of gap time cause in the classroom as teachers wait in vain for quick responses from students.

Involving reticient students or shy conversational partners so that the turns are symmetric is an art that we all strive to master. In learning another language, acquisition of turn-taking signals may be either easy or difficult depending on how closely they correspond with those of our first language. The social consequences of not learning them, however, make them worthy of our attention.

# Practice 14.3

1. List lexical phrases that get you an extended tum at talk. Are these "monologue" signals the same in the language you are learning or teaching? Are the same lexical phrases used by mmen and women, by children and adults, by people of different status groups? Are these lexical phrases included in your language textbooks?   
2. Are the gaps between turns the same length in your L1 and the language you are teaching or learning?   
3. Do differences in gap times reflect social role differences or, perhaps, urban and rural differences? when the gaps between speakers do not match, what interpretation is put on the mismatch by each speaker (do they think the other person is pushy if the speaker overlaps their turn; do they think the other person is slow or not interested in them if it is long?).   
4. Many methodologists suggest that teachers ask a question without calling on a specific student and then silently count to six so that all students have time to think of an answer. After counting to six, the teacher is then to call on an individual student. Can you vary gap time (the count to six rule)? Are there different cultural assumptions regarding gap time between yourself and your students?

7. Dornyei and Thurrell (1992) suggest that language students use an observation sheet to discover how turn taking works according to their textbook and also in authentic language use. How might you adapt it for use with your students? How might you see whether using the observation sheet actually improved not only their awareness of turn taking but also their performance in using appropriate signals?

# Acoustically adequate and interpretable messages

In order for communication to succeed, our talk must be comprehensible. When we are learning a language, that is not always the case. Sometimes we do not understand and sometimes what we say is not understandable. When that happens we use lexicai phrases as well as nonverbal gestures to signal the communication breakdown.

Language students are usually supplied with lists of lexical phrases that they can use when they don't understand ("Sorry?" I'm sorry, I don't understand." "Would you mind repeating that?" "I'm sorry, could you say that slower??). They may also be told to repeat part of wbat the spcaker has said with rising intonation. When students do not use these or other signals, the teacher or other speaker may use lexical phrases to check comprehension. Questions phrases "Clear?" "OK?" "Do you understand?" are typical comprehension cbecks.

In ordinary conversation, when we get muddled we can signal a repair with lexical phrases like "I mean," "I sbould say," "In other words," "That is," "Well uhhh actually," and then reformulare our talk. There is a definite preference for the speaker who is being unintelligible to repair his or her own talk. For someone else to do it seems impolite. Still, lexical phrases like "You mean - ?" Do you mean?" "Are you saying that - ?" "I think you mean -- ?" can be used. The lexical phrase "What do you mean?" must be used with care because it can be a simple appeal for help Or a challenge to the speaker's veracity or point of view.

As language learners, we are not always able to organize our thoughts quickly. In order to produce interpretable messages (let alone grammatically correct messages) we need to learn the words and lexical phrases that will buy us a little time. The so-called disfluency signals (uhh, umm, err, hmmm) may not seem like words but they give you a minute to think of how to say something. Lexical phrases such as "Let's see," "Let me think a minute," "Ohhh just a minute" are also used for this function.

When others misunderstand us, there is also a set of lexical phrases that we can use to either apologize or to claim that the fault is not with us but with the listener: "Sorry, I'm sorry, I meant --," "Maybe it's more like - ,' "I'm really muddled, let me try again," "No, I didn't mean that," "That's not what I said," "All I was trying to say was - .

In previous chapters we have talked about definitions but not how definitions are given in ordinary communication. We do much definition giving in classroom settings, but it is also very common in conversations as we search for the words we need to make our messages interpretable. Definition giving is also included among Tarone's (1977, 1980) communication strategies. When we cannot think of the words we need, we may try the following:

1. Message adjusrment or avoidance (i.e., change the topic)   
2. Paraphrasing (e.g., "that thing you look at cells" $=$ microscope)   
3. Approximation (e.g., "kinda like a prize" $=$ lottery)   
4. Mime (e.g., circular hand gestures $\bumpeq$ merry-go-round)   
5. Appeal for help (e.g., "oh, what's that word that means - \*)

Although meanings do get negotiated in this way, lexical phrases such as "How do you say -- ?" What's the word that means - ?" The thing you use to -- ,""The place you go to - ," Kinda -,n Kinda like - " carry the discourse function of showing that help is needed to make the message clear.

Teachers often worry that their messages may not be clear to students. They may simplify their vocabulary choices, restate concepts in several different ways, write words or draw diagrams and pictures on the board, or give definitions. They may also paraphrase, approximatc, use mime, appeal for help, or give up and change the topic.

# Practice 14.4

1. What lexical phrases are used in the language you teach or are studying to show a lack of understanding or inabitity to respond? Are these presented in your teaching materials? Give examples.   
2. The pause fillers that help us buy time are not the same in al! languages. Students often use the distluency signals of their L1 when speaking the target language. What pause fillers are used in your target language? Are these presented in your textbook? Is it appropriate to use laughter for this function or does it only signal embarrassment at not being able to articulate the message?

3. Dornyei and Thurrell (1992) suggest the following activity: After students have performed a diatogue well, ask one of the students to pretend not to remember some of the crucial content words. Note the use of mime, types of paraphrases, and appeals for help that the student is able to use. Call these to the attention of the students and ask them to replicate this with their next dialogue (explaining why this is an important skill to develop). Do you have suggestions for further practice? How might you evaluate the effectiveness of the practice?   
4. In what ways do native speakers assist leamers in conversations? How often are definitions given or asked for? How helpfut is simplification, restatement, remodeling, and summary in preventing communication breakdown? How could you discover whether these really help the learner?

# Non-participant constraints

In communication, there have to be ways of ignoring "noise" that occurs around us. At a reception, we cannot listen and be part of one conversation and listen in and be part of another at the same time, so we shut out the communication that we are not part of. On the other hand, there have to he ways of joining or even interrupting on-going communication of which we have not been a part. Special lexical signals can be used for this.

Young children often use attention-getting signals to enter a conversation. They may call out the name of one of the participants (e.g., \*Hey, Mom!") or they may use the \*lookit" formula (e.g., "Lookit, hey lookit") to gain the attention of persons with whom they want to converse. Although laughter is not a lexical item, it is a communication signal. A person may approach a group, use eye contact, and join in the laughter to gain admittance to the group. We may also repeat part of what has just been said and then use a lexical phrase to explain the reason for commenting on it:

(A is part of a group. B is walking slowly by.)   
A: ... just another tax hike.   
B: Tax hike? (repetition) That's interesting, I was just talking to C. about tax hikes.   
(B joins group)

Or we may move to participant status using lexical phrases such as \*I couldn't help overhearing" and then a statement as to why we are entitled to comment.

(A is talking to her children. B is standing nearby.) A: .. . because it's not good for you. (looks at B)

B: (smiles) I couldn't help hearing you. I agree. This stuff is terrible.

When we need to preempt communication momentarily and then leave, it is customary to ask permission or even to apologize for doing so ("Can I interrupt for a minute?" "Sorry to interrupt you," "Excuse me, could I bother you for a minute?"). Some of these lexical signals can also be used to interrupt speakers when they attempt to hog the floor or when they wander off the subject.

# Practice 14.5

1. What preemption or interruption signals are there in the Ianguage you teach? How acceptable are interruptions, and are there situations in which one must not interrupt? Are the nonverbal signals of interruption the same in the L1 and the target language?   
2. What lexical phrases do parents use to prevent children from inappropriately interrupting adult communication? Are these same lexical phrases used by teachers to prevent students from inappropriate interrupting?   
3. Which of the following phrases are more likely to be used when the speaker sirnply wants to join in (move from nonparticipant to participant status)? which might be used if the speaker wants to deliver a message and then leave? Which might be used when the speaker wants to interrupt to make a point or add to the point? Can some be used for more than one of these situations?   
Sorry to break in --   
Can I interrupt you for a second --   
Well, yeh but --   
Did I hear you say -- ?   
I couldn't hetp overhearing -   
4. Rewrite one of your teaching dialogues to include an interruption sequence - a sequence that gives students the appropriate signals for interrupting and entering the dialogue. How could you determine whether such praotice was effective?   
5. Plan an activity that gets students to practice appropriate and inappropriate interruption. Can they successfully (tactfully or otherwise) shut out inappropriate interruptions? What are the lexical phrases that they recognize and use for this function?

# Gricean norms

Communication specialists offer four maxims for successful communication, called Gricean norms" after Grice (1975). The contributions of all communicating partners should be (a) relevant to the topic, (b) truthful unless noted as otherwise, (c) of appropriate quantity, and (d) the manner in which the contribution is made (i.e., clarity, lack of ambiguity, and general politeness) should allow for easy interpretation of the message. This does not mean that the maxims cannot be and are not violated. They are, but for special effect.

The maxim of relevance assumes that a topic can be identified in the communication and that the contributions of individuals contribute to that topic. One way of making sure that the topic is clear is to provide a structuring move or a statement of the topic. For example, in classrooms teachers structure the lesson for the day with such lexical phrases as "Today we're going to discuss X." The teacher may go on to identify subtopics (e.g., "that includes a, ${ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { b } } } , { \boldsymbol { \mathrm { c } } } ^ { \ast } \}$ or to explain how the discussion will proceed (e.g., " first, we'll . . . then. .. . then . . . and finaily, if there is time, we'll -- "). The structuring move sets the topic, limits the types of contributions that will be relevant, and may set the sequence for the contributions.

In conversations, topics may be announced rather than structured: ("Did you hear about meeting at $4 { : } 0 0 { : } ^ { \circ }$ (contributions should be relevant to the meeting at 4:00), \*Do you want to go over to Betty's?" (contributions should be relevant to going to Betty's), "We're going to have an inservice" (contributions should be relevant to having an in-service workshop). It is also possible to negotiate a topic, as shown in this fragment from a phone conversation:

S: Oh, the Lakers' were terrible last night. E: Uggg, don't wanta talk about it.   
S: Yeh but   
E: They won't make it to the playoff.   
S: Yeh but   
E: Let's talk about that new truck D. got. S: Okay, what color is it? It's a '94, right?

Although contributions should be relevant to the topic, it is possible to shade the topic or shift gradually to another related topic. In the classroom, as each of the subparts of a topic are finished the teacher may mark the shift with a series of "OK?-OK" or $^ { 6 6 } \mathrm { O K } ? - 5 \mathrm { O } ^ { 3 5 }$ lexical transition markers. The teacher is making sure that everyone realizes that one section is finished, that everyone understands everything so far, and agrees to go. Once backchannel signals show this agreement, the teacher utters a second okay or so to show that one part is finished and the next part is to begin.

At the end of the class, the teacher may use a summary to show that the topic has been completed. In conversations, there are many lexical phrases that show we are ready to stop talking about one topic and to move on to another. Dorynei and Thurrell (1992, p. 38) have an interesting list of "proverbs and platitudes" that can be used to conclude a topic. Included on the list are such phrases as "That's the way it goes." "Makes you think, doesn't it?" "It just goes to show (you can't be too careful / you never can tell)," "What would we do without you?" "You can't win them all." (Notice that in previous chapters we talked about proverbs, idioms, and frozen lexical phrases as though they existed in a vacuum. Here we are saying that they can have definite discourse functions.) At the end of a long trouble-sharing sequence, the following proverb and frozen lexical phrase were used:

J: I've given up. There's no use trying.   
E: Yeh. Jes goes to show you can't lead a horse. . .   
J: Yeh, I've learned my lesson. Never again.

Having uttered such topic-closing phrases, it is up to the speakers to nominate the next topic or to begin their preclosing moves.

We have said that the Gricean norms of cooperative conversation can be violated. If a contribution is not relevant, we may interpret the person as being rude, not interested, or disruptive. Or, if the contribution is from a language learner, we may assume that the person was unable to identify the topic of conversation. Even in ordinary classrooms, teachers often have to struggle to construct relevance for the replies of students. They may restate and reform the student's utterance to make it more relevant to the announced topic.

When structuring moves and transition moves are not made explicit by the teacher (or by tbe leader of any other group that has met to carry out a task announced by the leader), students (or participants) are unsure how to behave appropriately - that is, how to make contributions that fit within the activity. Dorr-Bremme (1990) found that most elementary school teachers marked shifts in topics using a variety of activity formulas - lexical phrases like "Okay, let's see who's not here today" to start the attendance topic, and "Kim, go get a magic marker and let's see if you can do the calendar today" to start the calendar topic. The teachers used framing words such as "All right? Okay?-Okay" at transition points. When such phrases and words were not used, the children interpreted the lack of such structuring and transition signals to mean that it was okay for then to talk or do whatever they wished since no topic or task had been announced. They didn't need to be relevant.

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

The second maxim of cooperative conversation is that the contribution should be truthful. There are no special words or lexical items associated with truthfulness. However, we do use interjections like uh, ummm, ahh, and b well when we doubt the truthfulness of something that has been said to us. We may also use words and lexical phrases such as "Really?" "Honest(ly)?" "You're kidding, right?" "You don't mean that." These responses show that we interpret obvious untruthfulness as a deliberate violation and therefore a joke.

The third maxim is one of quantity, a maxim that we have already discussed in part in talking about fairness of turn length. If our friends violate this cooperative maxim, we may do a preempt interruption to force more symmetry in turns. On the other hand, we nay allow people to tell us more than we ever wanted to know ahout a subject because they are the teacher, the parent, or the boss.

The fourth maxim is one of manner. That is, the contribution should be clear, unambiguous, and polite. We have discussed clarity in discussing interpretable messages. The message should be clear rather than ambiguous. The politeness issue is one that spreads across all of discourse. We judge and manipulate the degree of politeness according to many of the variables discussed in Chapter 13.

# Practice 14.6

1. What lexical phrases do you use in the classroom to structure activities? What structuring hints are offered in your teaching rmaterials? Are they specific to individual lessons?   
2. What lexical phrases do you use to show topic shifts (e.g., "Okay?-Okay.")? What lexical phrases do you use to show a final summary is about to take place?   
3. Plan an activity where students negotiate topics in conversation. First, have them list lexical phrases they might use to say they do not want to talk about a suggested topic (e.g., "Oh no, not that again!"). Have them divide these into those to be used only with friends and those to be used with others. Then, have them list lexical phrases for Suggesting another topic (e.g., "How about $\pmb { X } , \ "$ "What about $X _ { \cdot } ^ { \ast }$ "Let's") Next, have each student write a topic on a card. Shuffle the cards and let everyone draw a topic Pair the students or have them work in small groups to practice negotiating the topics they have drawn.   
4. In English we use oh, uh, ah, uh wel, and other interjections when a contribution is not what we expect, when it is not exactly relevant, or when we doubt truthfulness. Are

The vocabulary of communication signals and speech acts similar signals used in the language you teach? Are these signals taught explicitly?

5. What lexical phrases (in addition to intonation) are used in the language you teach to show that something being said is pretense/teasing? Are these inctuded in your teaching materials? Are responses (the equivalent of "You're kidding," "Oh, come on," "You're joking") also included in the materials. If not, plan an activity to practice violation of the truthfulness maxim.

6. Contributions should be clear rather than obscure or ambiguous. Are there any special lexical phrases that you use when you get muddled or cannot organize your thoughts?

7. Dornyei and Thurrell give an example of breaking each maxim:

A: Where are you going?   
B: To buy some stamps. (fulfills all the maxims)   
B: To the moon (truthfu/ness violation)   
B: To the door, then down the stairs, then out into the street, then - (quantity violation)   
B: Have you called your mother yet? (relevance violation)   
B: I'm going to get something to put on a letter. (clarity violation)

They suggest having students work in small groups to rewrite a dialogue so that it breaks one of the tour maxims. Each group then performs its version while the others listen and decide which maxim is violated. Do you have other suggestions about how you might work on the maxims with your students?

# Framing or bracket signals

The final type of communication signal shows that part of the communication is not directly related to the on-going message. The sidesequence is marked at the beginning with lexical bracket phrases such as "Oh, before I forget it," "That reminds me," "To change the subject just for a minute," " Oh incidentally." At the end of the "side-sequence" there are signals to mark a return to the previous topic: "Getting back to - , "Anyway," "As we were saying - ."

Nonverbal gestures often accompany these verbal signals. Body shifts, head movements, and looking up and to the right are often signals for a side-sequence. In writing, we may use footnotes or place material in parentheses.

# Practice 14.7

1. Look at the following list of bracket phrases. When might each be used or are they all interchangeable? Can you produce and categorize a similar list in the language you teach or are learning?

By the way -- That reminds me - Speaking of -- Talking about X reminds me Before I forget it - Oh, I nearly forgot - Oh, I just thought of something -- This has nothing to do with what we're discussing but To change the subject for a minute -- What phrases might be used to get the communication back to the original topic? Are they similar to the following English phrases? As I was saying (before I so rudely interrupted myself) - Now, where was I? But let's not digress! Going back to -- Let's get back to -- Anyway - But let's get back to the subject.   
2. Ask students to note the times that you or other speakers of the target language use the phrases that you have listed as bracket signals.   
3. Wrte a short side sequence for one of the dialogues in your text. What do you hope your students will learn from this addition? How might you be more direct in teaching this function?

Communication signals form an important part of the vocabulary of the language. The discourse meanings of many of these vocabulary items, however , are seldom given in dictionaries. You won't find okay defined as a topic transition marker, anyway as a bracket signal, or so as a preclosing signal. The emphasis placed on the acquisition of these signals, however, varies not only according to the goals and approach in language education, but also across cultures. Studying child-rearing practices, Fernald and Morikawa (1993) found that Japanese mothers were very concerned with communication signals, the rituals of social exchange while American mothers were very concerned with helping their children learn the names of objects. In playing with their children, American mothers labeled toys and identified their parts ("That's a car. See the car? You like it? It's got nice wheels"). The Japanese mothers in their study often used onomatopoeia (buubuu-vroom-vroom for car, truck, and an animal noise wanwan [woof-woof ] for dog) and used these unlabeled objects to engage infants in social routines: Hai buubuu (Here! It's a vroom-vroom) Choo-dai (give me). Hai arigatoo (yes, thank you).

Many parents feel that social formulas, meaning appropriate openings and closings, turn taking, non-interruption of others, giving relevant responses, talking the appropriate amount of time, and politeness formulas, can best be learned by a combination of expiicit teaching and their own modeling. In language classes, we see a wide range of opinions. Some teachers apparently fee! they are of little importance, using the signals of the L1 rather than the target language for classroom management. Others believe these can easily be acquired without explicit instruction. As teachers, thcy modcl thc signals in the target language and believe that students can acquire them in this way. The third position is one to which we subscribe. Communication signals are a very important part of the vocabulary of a language and the system, the words, and the lexical phrases should be explicitly taught.

# Practice 14.8

1. Can you or your students learn the vocabulary (and the system) of communication signals of a new language without explicit instruction? How much opportunity will you or your students have to observe these signals being used by fluent speakers of the language? Give evidence to support your contention regarding the need or lack of need for explicit instruction.   
2. Are all of the communication signals discussed in this section included for explicit instruction in your language teaching materials? How accurate are the materials? Do they show what speakers really do in the dialect of the language you want to learn or teach?   
3. If you believe that the teacher needs to use the first language to carry out many communication signals discussed in this section because of the students' proficiency level, at what point do you think a shift to the target language should begin? Is there any particular sequence that might be used for this shift (i.e., should the first shift be for openings and closings)?   
4. You will have noticed that many ot the signals are not precisely words (e.g., uhh, umm), some are words (e.g.. wow!, hi!), and others are phrases (e.g., "I know what you mean," "How's it going?"). Which do you think would be the easiest to learn or to teach? Justify your answer.

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

5. Would it be possible to learn the lexical phrases and words used as communication signals and very little else and still be able to carry on a conversation? Wouid it be possible to learn many lexical phrases and words but none that are used as communication signals and still carry on a conversation? Give evidence to support your answer.

# The lexicon of speech acts and speech events

Speech act research draws on the work of Searle, Austin, Halliday, and Wierzbicka, among others. The overall goal of the research is to discover whether it is possible to identify some limited number of functions for which we use language. The speech act categories used by American linguists usually include:

Directives (ask others to do or to not do something) Examples: Pick up your shoes! Let's go to the mall.

Commissives (promises or refusals for action) Examples: Yes, I will. I already gave at the office.

Representatives (factual information) Examples: The class meets at 1:00. Maybe it's kinda blue.

Declaratives (bring about a change or new state of being) Examples: I find you guilty as charged. I pronounce you husband and wife.

Expressives (statements of feeling)

Examples: What a great day! Oh, I'm so sorry!

The Council of Europe used speech-act theory as a basis for the notionalfunctional approach to language teaching. Communicative language teaching shares much with this approach. The instruction hopes to produce students who are able to use language to carry out functions such as those listed above in communication.

In language education, speech act research has been important for it seeks to understand whether speech acts have universal categories and whether within each language they are performed in a way that reflects the social norms and assumptions of the culture. We will return to this issue after we have discussed basic functions and some of the typical Iexical phrases used for each.

Teachers and methodologists differ over whether or not the lexicon of speech acts should be taught. Many believe they will be learned automatically, without explicit teaching, as students use the language. Perhaps this is true, but our position is that explicit teaching can make that learning more efficient.

It is impossible in the space remaining to discuss each of the functions and typical lexical phrases for each. Rather, we will discuss the functions identified in the Threshold Level (Ie niveau seuil) of syllabus design. These differ somewhat from the functions of Austin and Searle, but we present them here because they are so widely used in syllabus design and materials development.

# Identification of functions

The functional approach works with six basic functions: Imparting and seeking (1) factual information, (2) intellectual information, (3) emotional information, (4) moral information, (5) suasion, and (6) socia! routines. We will look at the first five of these functions in more detail since social routines have already been discussed in the section on communication signals.

When we ask for factual information from someone we do not know well, we are likely to use softened lexical phrases, such as "Would you . . . ?" "Could you ... ?" "Do you mind telling me ... ?" "Could you give me some information?" "Could you find out about ... ?" Notice the use of the modals could and would that make the request more polite. Among friends we are more likely to use a direct question, such as "What's a . .. ?" "Know anything about . . . ?" "Where do you keep the ..?n "What's the name of that... ?"

Language teachers are trained to give students as much practice in asking information questions as possible. Students are, however, more likely to practice the forms used with strangers than those used with close friends.

The first response learned for factual questions is often "I don't know." In very informal situations, the inability to offer factual information can be expressed in such lexical phrases as, "Don't have a clue." As with all communicative language teaching, students will need to be helped to understand the register appropriateness of various forms.

# Practice 14.9

1. In a language of your choice, what question forms are used when the speaker does not know the person from whom information is to be received? Are they softened through modality, or are other lexical politeness formulas used?   
2. When might you ask for information with "Got any idea about . . . ?" "Know anything about . . . ?" "Have you heard anything about . . . ?" "1s this the way to . . . ?" "Where do you keep the . . . ?" what are the parallel forms in the language you teach? At what level would it be appropriate to present these forms? Do students hear these forms in your class during other activities?   
3. When we are asked for information we cannot supply, we may use lexical phrases like \*Sorry, I don't know." What kinds of lexical phrases do you use when you do not know how to answer a student's question? How do students respond to questions when they do not know the answer?   
4. When might a speaker reply 'Don't have a clue," "Don't ask me," or "No idea"? What parallel forms are there for these lexical phrases in the language you teach or are learning?   
5. Examine your language learning dialogues tor information exchanges. What question forms are used? If you vary the dialogue so that the asker and answerer are acquaintances (perhaps the clerk and customer are friends), how would the questions and answers change? Have students vary the dialogue drawing attention to the changes.   
6. Dornyei and Thurrell (1992) suggest the folowing activity: Devise a "mystery' scene. In each group, one or two students get to be the detective and ask lots of questions. The other students are the suspects who must answer the questions. If students are advanced, some can be willing answerers and others can use the 'no idea, don't have any idea' type responses. How might you determine whether this "game" promotes the acquisition of lexicat phrases for seeking and imparting factual intormation? Why is it important to practice expressing one's inability to give factual information?

# Expressing and discovering intellectual attitudes

The intellectual function includes asking about or stating our attitudes toward information. Do we agree or disagree with the information? Do we consider the information possible or impossible, logical or illogical, certain or uncertain? In many notional-function texts, this function also includes asking and giving permission, offering and either accepting or rejecting invitations, which we will discuss in the section on suasion.

Common lexical phrases used to ask for other's opinions are "What do you think?" "What would you say ahout X?" Common lexical phrases to express one's own opinion are $\Im \mathrm { I }$ think,n "In my opinion," "If you ask me." Lexical formulas such as "I agree" or, in teenage talk, "for sure, for sure" are used to show agreement. It is much more difficult to tell someone that you disagree with their opinions. In political debates, it is common to hear "I disagree" but in ordinary conversation we are less direct, using such phrases as "umm," "maybe," and "Do you really think so?" to express disagreement.

Common lexical phrases express whether we think something is (im)possible (e.g., "I'm sure, It's possible/probable/impossible"). Less common phrases, such as "Can't prove it by me," "Why ask me?" or "Don't know" not only show we do not know but also that we do not perhaps even like to be asked.

Expressing certainty or uncertainty is an especially important function in academic environments. In some fields it is quite proper to express strong to weak certainty, using such words and phrases as without doubt, clearly, arguably. In other fields, one never expresses certainty about information, and one cannot say something proves or causes something else. Instead, such lexical phrases as \*it appears," "it suggests," "it may be," "x supports (does not support)" are used. In classrooms, however, teachers and students may report uncertainty with lexical expressions such as "I'm not sure, but...," "We still have not determined" (decided) . . . ," or "There is much argument about . . ." Only the brave will joke, $^ { \bullet } \mathrm { I }$ was absent that day," to show inability to respond to a teacher's question.

# Practice 14.10

1. When would you use 'I think.. ." or "Do you know what ! think? I think . . ." or "If you ask me . . ."? Are there paralIel forms for these phrases in the language you teach? Are these presented in your teaching materials? If they are not, do you use them in classroom interactions?   
2. How do you vary the strength of the opinion in the language you teach? what parallel forms are there for "I'd say . . . ," "It seems to me . . " "As near as I can tell " "I'm pretty sure that . ..., " "lt appears . n "It's quite clear that. . . ." Which are used in academic discourse? Are these included in your teaching materials?   
3. Adverbs of certainty are a little tricky (for the linguist if not for language learners). The word positive seems to show more confidence than sure or certain as shown in the exchanges:

A: Are you sure? B. I'm positive. A: Are you positive? B: Well, I'm (pretty) sure.

Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

Does the following list reflect your understanding of which terms carry the most or the least certainty?

Most certain definitely certainly undeniably doubtlessly apparently probably conceivably supposedly possibly   
Least certain doubtfuily

In what sorts of discourse might speakers or writers use these forms? if you teach technical writing, how frequently are these used and do they carry the same certainty value in all fields?

4. Select a basic dialogue and add phrases for expressing opinions and agreement with opinions. Dornyei and Thurrell (1992) suggest writing some of the lexical phrases on cue cards and giving them to students. First, have them perform the dialogue in its original form. The second time they must add in the phrases on their cards. Another variation is the "silly Sam' game where "Sam' agrees with whatever anyone says. Students make all sorts of nonsensical claims and the student who is "Sam' must agree.   
5. Change the dialogue again so that opinions are expressed and the other person disagrees. (This witl be much more difficult.) Try to vary the dialogue so that students tirst practice polite disagreement and then disagreement with a close friend. Devise a "Disagreeable Dan" game where "Dan" disagrees with every staternent. Students can trick "Dan" into a disagreement when he wants to agree.

# Expressing or inquiring about emotional attitudes

The expressive function allows us to show our own or inquire about another's interest, surprise, hope, fear, worry, preference, intention, want, or desire. The function includes expressing gratitude, sympathy, and compliments.

We use backchannel signals to express our interest and support of the speaker and to encourage the speaker to continue his or her message. Such expressives as "wow!" "really!n "I can't believe it!" "Can you imagine!" show a heightened interest, surprise, or fear. Expressives, however, can be the central topic of conversation (e.g., \*I'm so worried about the exam!").

Advice-seeking and troubles-sharing are typical types of discourse where emotional attitudes become the focus of attention. Lexical phrases like "I'm so worried," "I'm so upset," and "I'm so angry" lead to narratives about what is wrong. Troubles-sharing assumes that sympathy will be offered (e.g., "That's too bad," "That's just not fair," "Poor you") and a negotiation of possible solutions (e.g., "Why don't you just . . . ," "I'd just . " " But I can't just . ..," "Maybe you should . . ."). These are fikely to he followed by some sort of platitude or consolation phrase like "We'll just have to wait and see what happens," "I'm sure everything will turn out for the best," or $\mathfrak { a } _ { \mathrm { O h } }$ , for heaven's sake, just shape up or ship Out!"

In American English, the most common expressions of gratitude are "thanks" and "thank you." To make this stronger, we may add so or very. "Thanks very much" is used by both men and women and in both formal and informal settings. The expression "Thank you very much indeed" sounds very formal (although it's often used on BBC broadcasts to thank the expert who has answered questions about the news of the day).

We noted that expressions of sympathy (or empathy) occur in troublessharing (e-g., "that's too bad," "that's really too bad"). The expression of sympathy at a death in a family is somewhat different. In such cases, it is difficult to know what will comfort the family. \*I'm so sorry" seems to be the basic expression used.

Compliments come in only a few forms. Manes and Wolfson (1981) found that over half of the 686 compliments they collected fit the lexical phrase formula \*X is/looks (really) ADJ" (\*Your hair looks really great!" "That blouse is really nice!"). Two more lexical phrases - \*I really like/ love $X ^ { \dag }$ ("I really love those shoes!") and "PRO is (really) a ADJ $X ^ { \dprime }$ ("This was reatly a great meal!") - allowed them to account for 85 percent of the compliments. Four less common lexical formulas complete the set: "You have a ADJ $X ^ { \ast }$ ("You have a great voice!"), "What a ADJ $X ^ { \ast }$ ("What a great shirt!"), "ADJ $X ^ { \mathfrak { s } }$ ("Great tie!"), and "Isn't X ADJ" ("Aren't you incredible!").

Compliment responses differ according to all the variables discussed in the previous chapters. American men often ignore compliments, whereas women are more likely to respond with thanks. Compliments often occur as "noticings" in the opening and closing sections of conversations, where they seem to be used as a kind of social bonding. When compliments occur elsewhere (as in praise of someone's work or performance), the compliment may be taken more seriously and its truth value negotiated in a series of responses following the compliment.

Compliments and responses may vary greatly across languages. Olshtain (1993), for example, notes that in Hebrew the reactions to compliments are much more varied and relate to the content of the compliment. In contrast, she found that approximately 90 percent of the responses in English were "Thank you."

Language learners often report their inability to use expressives in the target language. They feel uncomfortable in not knowing how strong or how modified their expressives should be. They may be unsure which lexical phrase is appropriate for use in certain situations or with specific people. They may feel uncomfortable receiving compliments that they may feel are insincere (but for the American English speaker are simply expressions of friendship). Although the native speaker can get away with outrageous expressives if they are said with a laugh (which shows they may not be meant the way they sound), learners may feel safer using neutral phrases or by not expressing their feelings at all. This is a shame, because friendship includes fluency in using the lexical phrases that show emotional attitudes.

1. What lexical phrases are there in the language you teach to show surprise? Are the same surprise signals used by both males and females? Are the frequency of such signals the same for men and women?

2. When and by whom might the following expressions be used?

Really? No, it can't be!   
Gosh! Wow! Oooh!   
What! Incredible!Amazing! Fantastic!   
I don't/can't believe it!

3. Dornyei and Thurrell (1992) use the following lists of lexical phrases for expression of pleasure and displeasure. Prepare an equivalent contrasting list of lexical phrases for the language you teach or are leaning. How might students practice those that are appropriate for their age group?

Oh, come on!   
Are you sure?   
Really!   
What!   
Are you pulling my leg?   
I don't/can't believe it!   
You're kidding/joking, aren't you?   
Oh, good!   
I'm so glad!   
Good for you!

4. Prepare a list of statements (e.g., "I left my books on the bus!" "I really messed up on the exam!' "My boyfriend won't take me to the party!' "I got an A!" "I'm going to Hawaii!) and have students reply with either positive (e.g., Hey, great!) or negative lexical phrases (e.g., That's terrible!) If your students like to joke, they may use the wrong ones (e.g., "You failed the exam? That's great!") and then you can teach the "What do you mean! It's terrible!" responses.

5. In what circumstances would the following lexical phrases be used? Are different phrases used by men and women? Give a few examples that show the phrases cannot be used in all circumstances.

I know the teeling!   
You poor thing! Poor you!   
I'm so sorry.   
That must have been horrible!   
You must be very sad/unhappy/upset.

What other expressions can you think of? what corresponding phrases are there in the language you teach or are learning?

6. In what dialects of English is the word right used in compliments instead of very? For example, do you say "t'm right proud of you!" rather than "I'm very proud of you! If you use right, can you also use it in other expressives (e.g., "That's right good news!). Do you also use just (e.g., "That's just marvelous!). Do you use real and really in expressives ("That's reat / really kind of you.")? Do you think the use of right as an intensifier for expressives is related in any way to the expression "Right on!"?   
7. Are the lexical phrases for giving and accepting compliments similar in the language you teach or are learning? Do they appear in the same places and with the same frequency as they do in American English? Do they serve the same social functions?

# Expressing or questioning mora/ attitudes

At some time, we do something we wish we had not and we then must apologize or request forgiveness. There are also times when we need to express approval or disapproval of the actions of others. In some syllabi, appreciation, regret, and indifference are included in this function group.

In our discussion of scripts, we said that evaluation is an important part of all communicarion. We constantly evaluate the actions of others, judge the appropriateness of the actions, and may or may not express that evaluation. Some roles, for example, teacher, parent, and supervisor require that evaluation be made explicit through praise (e.g., \*Good job! You're doing great!") or criticism (e.g., "Try it this way!" "I'm disappointed that you .. ." "Maybe you could . . ." "Well of all the nerve! How could you?"). For these roles, at least, it is only in frustration that we offer a last resort expression of indifference - "I don't care WHAT you do! Do anything you want!" - meaning that we care very much and hope the behavior will change.

Gripes and complaints are meant to contrast what is with what ought to be. Brown and Levinson (1978) classify direct complaints as \*facethreatening acts" - acts that may disturb the relationship between the complainer and the person responsible for the complaint. Perhaps that is why it is so much easier to complain about a person's behavior to someOne else.

Brown and Levinson say we have three options in expressing complaints: decide not to complain at all, usc "off-record" strategies like hints and rhetorical questions, or use bald "on-record" strategies such as direct, clear statements of complaint. If speakers decide to use on-record strategies, they have two choices. They may use a "positive politeness" form, where the complaint focus is on how the behavior harms the one who has misbehaved (e.g., \*I'm worried about your health. Cigarettes can be very bad for you") or a "negative politeness" form, which focuses on the well-being of the person making the complaint (e.g., "We don't allow smoking here"). Brown and Levinson classify language/culture groups as preferring one form over the other. English is said to be a "negative politeness" language.

In research on complaints, data from Americans show the use of nega. tive politeness forms, but the complaints are softened with hedges (e.g., "Uhh, any chance of your maybe keeping the noise down a little bit or something, maybe just turning it down a notch?"). Nash (1983) found that Taiwanese Chinese speakers used positive politeness forms. The translated complaints about a guest who stayed out late and made a lot of noise on returning to the house included expressions of worry about health ("it's too hard on you staying out so late. Your health is important") and safety ("If something were to happen to you . . . in the middle of the night, nobody would know"). The Americans and Chinese in this study did have in common the fact that they seldom said that the behavior bothered only them. Instead they used we or shifted the complaint locus to someone else (e.g., "My wife ...," "It's the kids, you know ..

"There are people . . . ,"). Many people avoid complaint situations altogether because it is difficult to complain and still preserve the social relationship.

If a complaint is accepted as legitimate, an apology and, perhaps, an expression of forbearance may be called for. In American English, com. mon lexical phrases of acknowledgment include "I didn't realize : . . , and "I just wasn't aware ..."). A denial of responsibility may be ex. pressed with lexical phrases like "Why tell me? It's not my fault." Apology lexical phrases include "I'm sorry," "Sorry," "Please forgive me." Common acceptance of apology expressions are "That's okay," "That's all right," "Never mind, it's okay." The formality of the setting and the degree of misbehavior determine whether the speaker will use a strong or weak form. A simple slight, apologized for with "Sorry," may be responded to with "No problem." A more serious infraction requires a more elaborate apology and response. "I'm so very sorry" followed by a promise of forbearance (e.g., "I'll be sure it doesn't happen again") or a request for forgiveness (e.g., "Will you please forgive me?") completes a formal expression of regret. Such an apology might be responded to with a reassuring "I'm sure you didn't mean to," or "Of course, it wasn't really that bad."

5. Olshtain (1993) discusses five "semantic formulas" for complaining:

a. Vague hint of the offense.   
b. Disapproval without direct mention that the hearer is responsible.   
c. Direct complaint with explicit reference both to the violation and the hearer's responsibility.   
d. Stronger complaint, expressing accusation and warning.   
e. A straightforward threat.

Give an example of a lexical formula that might be used for each type. Then, give lexical formulas of responses to the complaint. Repeat the activity in another language of your choice. How similar are the types of phrases used in the two languages?

# Suasion

There are many ways in which we can influence the actions of others. We can suggest, request, invite, instruct, advise, or warn someone to (not) do something. There are also a variety of ways to offer or request assistance so that we can complete tasks.

Some of the most commonly presented lexical phrases in ESL/EFL textbooks do the following:

Suggest a course of action: Let's; We could   
Advise others to do something: Why don't you; I can recommend   
Warn to refrain: Be careful; Look out   
Offer or request assistance: Can you help me? Can I help you?

The lexical phrase \*I can recommend" does not seem to he very common in our experience, although waiters use it as they make suggestions to customers on what to order!

Research on gender issues has shown that girls use let's frequently in their interactions as they make plans for an activity or in carrying it out. Boys, on the other hand, use many more direct imperatives (e.g., \*Don't touch that!" "Hit it!"). Girls and boys also use different noncompliance responses. Boys, for example, are more likely to use the phrase "No way, man" than are girls. However, one girl in a classroom we observed was just as determined to not do whatever anyone told her to do. Her response was a stubborn"Won't!"

# The vocabulary of communication signals and speech acts

Not surprisingly, suasion (in all its many forms) makes up the bulk of the language addressed to preschoo! children. Suasion doesn't stop, though, when children enter school. Teacher talk also contains a very Iarge amount of suasive speech. These range from direct to indirect forms (e.g., "Open your books to page 213." "Write your name in the upper right hand corner of your paper." "Could you please speak a little louder?" \*I'd like you to help me, but I know your reading teacher is probably waiting for you right now.").

Offers and the acceptance or rejection of offers also belong with suasion because they are requests that the addressee do something - to accept what is being offered. Offers and acceptance of offers do not seem to be particularly difficult for students studying English as a second or foreign language. Rejecting offers, however, can be problematic for both native speakers and learners of the language because rejection may damage the social relation with the person making the offer. When invitations are offered, it is expected that they will be accepted. To avoid outright rejection, we may use lexical phrases as preliminaries to invitation. If someone says "What are you doing this weekend?" or "Are you doing anything special this weekend?" we know that an invitation is on the way. It is possible, though admittedly difficult, to reject the invitation at this point by replying as though the preliminary was really an information question. For example, one might say, "We've planned a really special weekend. We're going to . : ." The invitation may then be made in a modified form (e.g., "Oh, too bad. We hoped you'd join us for .. .") which can be rejected (e.g., \*Oh, I'm sorry. If I'd known. But perhaps we can do that another time"). If the original response is "I'm not sure" or "Nothing, why?" we have indicated that we will accept the impending invitation. Lexical phrases of invitation include: "We were wondering if you would like to . . . :, ," "We'd like you to come ... .," "We're having a... hope you can come. Come on over." To reject the offer after that would be difficult. Of course, we can always say we have to check with other members of the family first.

2. What lexical phrases do you use in class to ask and receive permission to do something? Are these phrases included in your course materials?

3. Arrange the following suasion phrases in terms of strength. Do you need more than the four categories in item 1 to classify them?

These X need (to be) VERB These potatoes need mashing.

Would (could) you (please) VERB Would you please pick up your shoes?

Could we have X done? Could we have the salt passed?

Let's VERB Let's give him a higher dosage, nurse.

May I have a NOUN May I have a salad, please

Gimme Give me a cookie!

i want (i don't want) NOUN/VERB I want a clean pair of socks, hon.

Seems kinda/awtul ADJ Seems kinda cold in here.

Ervin-Tripp (1972) suggested that the phrases used for suasion vary according to whether the person addressed is a subordinate, a familar subordinate or equal, an unfamiliar person, a person who differs in rank or who is physically distant, someone who is in his or her own territory, someone whose willingness to comply is in doubt, someone who might not comply or when there is an obstacle to compliance, and family members, people who live together, and work groups. Can you identify which of the phrases presented in this exercise you would use in addressing each of these addressees?

Then match these to the types of requests that might have evoked them (e.g., "Would you please," "Do it! "Kindly X," "Do you think you could possibly X?"). Which of these are appropriate tor your teaching syllabus?   
6. What lexical phrases are used for invitations and acceptance and rejection of invitations in the languages you teach or are studying. Are these presented in your text?

# Socializing

We have already discussed communication signals that ease social interaction and allow communication to be negotiatcd among the participants. But lexical phrases for a number of other social acts - introducing, proposing a toast, offering congratulations, bcginning (and closing) a meal - also need to be acquired.

The lexical phrases commonly uscd in American English for introductions are "X, this is" (my friend, colleague, the person I've been telling you so much about) $^ +$ Y's name, then, ${ } ^ { * } Y ,$ this is x." In response to the introduction, each of the newly introduced people may express their pleasure at being introduced with words and lexical phrases that vary according to the age, sex, status of the participants, and social setting: "HHi," "Hello," "Glad to meet you." "Nice to meet you." The "pleased to meet you" lexical phrase seems to be used primarily by older people or in formal situations.

American English has no obligatory lexical phrase to call persons to the table for a meal. However, there are phrases that vary from formal (e.g., "Shall we have dinner?" "Shall we all sit down to dinner?") to a neutral announcement (e.g., \*Dinner's ready!") to the informal (e.g., "Soup's on!" "Chow time!"). Some family groups offer a grace or thanksgiving upon being seated; others do not. There is no special lexical phrases like "bon appetit" to be said by the parent or host or hostess. During the meal, there are many offers (suasion) such as \*Have another X," Would you please pass the X.r At the end of the meal, it is common to thank the person who prepared the food or who invited everyone to the table. Again, these thanks may vary in degree of formality (from "This was a

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

wonderful meal, X, thanks very much" to "Yum, Mom, you did it again!") and the acknowledgment of the thanks may serve as a closing signal to the meal, ailowing everyone to leave the table.

# Practice 14.14

1. Does your language text include instruction on introductions? what lexical phrases are used? Are there special phrases used to describe each of the participants? For example, atter the basic introduction, does the person doing the introduction then comment on something about each person as a way of giving them a topic for conversation (e.g., "John's been telling me about the work he's been doing in Mojave. You've been doing some exploration, too, haven't you?)

2. Do your materials include lessons in both self and other introduction? Are the rules of introduction the same in English and the language you teach? Do your materials limit the types of introductions to be practiced (e.g., age, role, status, sex, situation). How much information is given about the person being introduced?

3. What lexical phrases are used to begin a meal in the language you teach? Are these modeled in your teaching materials? Are there special exical phrases to use in offering, accepting/rejecting offers of food and drink? What lexical phrases are used to end the meal?

4. In American English, there are no special lexical phrases that we are aware of for offering toasts. Toasts are given on special occasions (e.g., To the bride and groom! at weddings) and even at some less special times (e.g., To the cook!). The toast on special occasions is often proceeded by a short anecdote that explains why the person offering the toast is entitled to make it. How comparable is this to the offering of toasts in the languages you teach or are leaming?

5. Look once again at Wong-Fillmore's (1976) list of lexical phrases used by bilingual children in an immersion class in California. How many of the phrases have a clear discourse function? How do you account for the accuracy of these phrases (because they were not taught) compared with the perhaps less "correct" use of other parts of the language?

# Research and application

# Communication signals

1. Godard (1979) describes the telephone openings in business and personal calls in French as compared with American English. In the French openings, callers identify the phone number within the sequence. Compare phone openings of other languages with those for French and Enghsh. In what ways are they similar and how do they differ? Answering machines also use set scripts often containing predictable lexical phrases. Collect data on these as well. How might you use the information you have collected in planning activities to teach the forms to students?

2. Tao and Thompson (199l) found that Mandarin speakers used relatively fewer backchannels than English speakers. Although the backchannel signals of English speakers may overlap the speaker's talk or fit very closely to it, Mandarin speakers have a perceptible gap between the speaker's talk and the backchannel. They also argue that the backchannels in Mandarin are used less to encourage the speaker than to show understanding of or agreement with the speaker. How might this information be useful in planning a lesson on backchannel signals for Chinese learners of English or for English-speaking Iearners of Mandarin?

3. Fernald and Morikawa (1993) compared the language addressed to 6-, 12-, 19-month-old children playing with toys at home. Thirty Japanese and thirty American (white, middle-class, some college) mothers and their children participated in the study. The researchers found that American mothers labeled objects more frequently and consistently. Japanese mothers, in contrast, used objects to engage infants in social routines. Fernald and Morikawa suggest that Korean mothers may emphasize the same rituals of social exchange as those of the Japanese mothers in this study. Because all groups use culturally appropriate child-rearing behaviors, consider rephicating the procedure with another group of mothers or with children who are somewhat older. What do mothers emphasize: the vocabulary of reference (names that refer to things) or communication signals and the lexical phrases of speech acts?

# Lexical phrases of speech acts

4. The goal of the Cross-cultural Speech Act Realization Patterns (CCARP) project (Blum-Kulka & Olshtain, 1984) is the development of data-elicitation methods and data analysis methods that would allow researchers to compare speech act performance across many language groups. Blum-Kulka, House, and Kasper (1989) express similar goals. After reading through these pubhcations, draw up a plan for carrying out similar research with speakers of another language group but shift the emphasis to a comparison of the lexical phrases used by each language group.   
5. In Conversational Routines Coulmas (l98l) offers a collection of research that compares the performance of particular speech acts by different language groups. Survey this volume and select

one article. What speech act was compared in this article? What Iexical phrases were used by each group? How were the data collected (i.e., do you think the lexical phrases used by participants in the study are those they use in naturai, unobserved conversation)? How were the data analyzed? What conclusions can you draw about teaching of the lexicon of this particular speech act based on the findings of this article?

6. Wolfson (1981, 1989) notes that bilinguais sometimes use the lex. ical phrases of a speech act from the first language when speaking the second. For example, a Farsi speaker complimented his mother's cooking saying, in English, "It was delicious, Mom. I hope your hands never have pain." In another example, an Iranian responded to his friend's compliment, "Your shoes are very nice," with, "It is your eyes which can see them which are nice." If you are from a bilingual family, it may be possible for you to collect data on the use of translated lexical phrases for a variety of speech acts. Consider submitting your findings to the Journa! of Pragmatics.

7. When Cook (i98l) asked students to ask directions or request the time, their performance did not differ much from that of native speakers, but the heavy use of modals in their lexical phrases made them sound more polite. They also used idiosyncratic lexical expressions such as "Thank you I very gratitude you' or "Be so kind of saying the shortest way to the bus station." The overall structure of the communication patterns were correct but the lexical phrases were less so. After reading Cook's research, plan a replication with speakers of other language groups.

8. D'Amico-Reisner (198l) analyzed the forms of disapproval expressions collected within family units or in conversations among people who were well acquainted. Two major patterns accounted for $86 \%$ of the data.

Requests for which responses were expected (45 percent)   
What are you eating? Why are you putting more syrup?   
Why (the hell) did you, hon?   
You gonna go or not? You coming?   
Do you always read people's mail? Declaratives (41 percent)   
This bathtub is filthy!   
You look a mess.   
Dishes should be emptied.   
(Hey hon) those socks are dirty.   
(Lookit) I've been standing here 20 minutes.

After you have read this article, explain why these forms are so different from those discussed in this chapter (or those presented in most language textbooks). Is it important to include these forms in teaching English complaints? If so, what kinds of activities might you do to practice them?

9. Harlow (1990) compared the French of American students with that of native speakers in three speech acts: requesting information, apologizing, and thanking. Harlow varied sociolinguistic factors such as the age, sex, and closeness of relationship with the addressee. How could you use the results of this research in teaching Frencli to Americans?

10. Scarcella (1979) used role plays of party invitations to study preinvitation, invitation, and acceptance or rejection by adult students of English. Examples such as "I forgot to tell you but I have a party this weekend." "Okay, you'll be one of the members" show that the lexical phrases for such speech acts need to be practiced. Devise a short lesson to teach pre-invitation phrases, invitations, and responses. How might you evaluate the effectiveness of your lesson?

1l. Our attitudes toward factual information are carried by verbs that group together as "believing" verbs and "doubting" verbs. Lehrer (1974) compared the types cf syntactic structures thet can be used with the verbs assume, presume, postulate, posit, presuppose, suppose, take (it) for granted, guess, know, believe, think, doubt. The analysis also includes the adverbs mentioned in Practice 14.10.3. Lehrar concludes that an inventory of lexical items is a beginning point, but that to understand the meaning and use of words, one must go far beyond constructing taxonomies or liats of words. This article is a good place to start for further research on attitudes toward intellectual information as a speech act. Do you agree or disagree with Lehrer's conclusion regarding the usefulness of lists of terms and tlie value of arranging them in hierarchies?

12. In this chapter, we have emphasized the vocabulary of lexical phrases used as communication signals and as speech acts. Specialists in discourse analysis object, and quite rightly, to an emphasis on lexical phrases because these phrases are useless unless they are correctly placed in negotiated discourse. Read Chapters 1, 2, and 4 of Hatch (1992), or Atkinson and Heritage (1984). How might you support explicitly teaching tlie discourse meanings of lexical phrases?

# 15 General vocabulary learning and learner strategies

While knowing more about semantics and the lexicon produces insights in us as language educators, most of us are principally interested in knowing how to translate that knowledge into practice or understanding of what learners do or should do and of what teachers do or should do to aid the process of language learning. Chapter 16 will deal with teachers and materials developers and the strategies they use to help learners learn and comprehend vocabulary. This chapter deals directly with Icarners' strategies for learning vocabulary and compensating for vocabulary that they do not know. We will look first at some of the general issues or questions that arise in discussions of vocabulary learning. Then we will discuss five steps that seem essential for students in their vocabulary learning. Finally, we will examine compensation strategies used by learners when they don't know or can't retrieve particular vocabulary items.

# General issues

Discussions of vocabulary learning are often divided between intentional Iearning and incidental learning. We define intentional learning as being designed, planned for, or intended by teacher or student. We define incidental learning as the type of learning that is a byproduct of doing or learning something else. There is general consensus among L1 vocabulary experts (e.g., Calfee & Drum, 1986; Stahl & Fairbanks, 1986; Beck, McKeown, & Omanson, 1987; Chall, 1987; Drum & Konopak, 1987; Graves, 1987) that intentional learning, in particular instruction, does aid in the learning of words. However, several studies have shown how few words are learned or taught by direct instruction compared to how many students need to know. For example, Nagy and Anderson (1984) and Nagy and Herman (1987) were able to show that even the most ambitious vocabulary teaching programs in the first language (in their case, English) did not teach more than a few hundred words per year. This in spite of the fact that there are more than 450,000 entries in Webster's Third International Dictionary and that claims are made that university students in the United States know at least 200,000 of them. We are quire sure that not all 200,000 have been intentionally taught.

In a second language the contrasts are just as vivid. According to

Ramsey (1981), a 12-year-old in Spain knows approximately 135,000 vocabulary words in the first language. High school students studying English in Spain are introduced to 800-1,000 English words in first year EFL classes, 1,700-2,000 more in second year classes, and another 2,500-3,000 in third year. So, in three years they might acquire, at most, 6,000 words in English. If they continued at the same rate for 12 years (to make the comparison to the 12-year-old fair), they would still know only about 24,000 words.

Because there is a definite gap hetween what is taught and what is known, more attention needs to be given to the issue of incidental vocabulary learning. Most of the work with incidental learning has focused on the vocabulary which is learned through reading. Saragi, Nation, and Meister (1978) looked at the learning of vocabulary by adults who read Burgess's A Clockwork Orange, which contains 241 words in an invented language called "nadsat." Saragi et al. designed a multiple-choice test containing 90 of the nadsat words and administered it to native English-speaking adults who had just read the book. The scores on the test ranged from 50 to 96 percent correct with an average of 76 percent correct, suggesting that the adults had learned about 70 words incidentally with just one reading of the book. Likewise, Nagy, Herman, and Anderson (1985), using 1,000-word passages and 57 eighth-grade students, have shown that incidental learning accounts for a large proportion of L1 vocabulary growth by school-age children.

Yun (1989) did a study similar to that of Saragi et al., using 32 intermediate ESL learners reading a simplified version of Tom Sawyer. Yun devised a test of 60 words which teachers had selected as ones students were likely not to know. She pre-tested her subjects and then tested them after they had read the book. She concluded that students learned incidentally approximately 16 percent of all unknown words with just one reading of the book. From scores on the pretest, she calculated that approximately 19 percent of the words in the book would have been unknown and, therefore, thar, on the average, 106 words would have been learned from just the one reading.

This incidental learning of words from reading in particular is apparently quite powerful also in the foreign language (rather than the second language) environment. In fact, after one study with French learners in the United States, the researchers, Dupuy and Krashen (1993) estimated that the learners who participated in reading and watching a film (in this case Tres hommes et un couffin) in class acquired approximately five to ten words per hour from incidental learning from a quite difficult text. The research did not test words that could have been learned from regular classroom interaction, so it is possible that students actually acquired even more words incidentally.

Besides the division between intentional learning and incidental learn

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

ing often discussed with regard to vocabulary learning, there is also the division between receptive vocabulary and productive vocabulary. Some people say the division is between "passive' and "active" vocabulary rather than between receptive and productive vocabulary. Belyayev (1963) criticizes the passive/active terms, arguing that reading and listening should not be considered passive skills and that, therefore, the vocabulary needed for those skills should not be considered passive, either. Linguists and teachers since then have generally accepted the receptive/ productive dichotomy, defining the two terms in much the same way as Haycraft (1978): receptive vocabulary is "words that the student recognizes and understands when they occur in a context, but which he cannot produce correctly," and productive vocabulary is \*"words which the student understands, can pronounce correctly and use constructively in speaking and writing" (p. 44). We sense that there is not really a dichotomy between receptive and productive but rather a continuum of knowledge, as Crow and Quigley (1985) have surmised. They suggest that learners may learn core or basic meanings of words sufficiently to understand what they hear or read without knowing enough about the syntactic restrictions, register appropriateness, or collocations to be able to produce the words on their own.

Furthermore, the discussions of dichotomy between receptive and productive vocabularies do not seem to take into account personal choice. We understand multitudes of words in our native language that we may never use. For example, we may understand terms used by our parents or grandparents, but never produce those terms, although we could. Likewise, we may recognize the meaning of nonstandard words such as ain't, or taboo words, but studiously avoid saying them because we are concerned about other people's views of us. This also suggests that the division between receptive vocabulary and productive vocabulary is not always real; lack of production may be due to choice and not simply lack of knowledge.

The most important point of the receptive/productive discussion is that it suggests that there are different ways to "know" a word, that what is considered sufficient knowledge under one circumstance will probably not be sufficient under others. In previous chapters we have talked about some of the things that speakers know and about lexical processes they use to come to this knowledge: semantic fields and features, core meanings and prototypes, lexical relations, universals, loan words and cognates, figurative language and metaphors, scripts or domains, word borrowing and coining, incorporation, word building, lexical classes, morphology, and social "markings" on words for location, gender, age, occupation, education, group, and formality.

The specificity of any individual's knowledge about a word depends on the person and his or her motivation, desires, and needs for the word.

Acquisition does not appear to be a simple throwing of a switch between knowing and not knowing; rather, there seems to be a continuum of knowledge about any word and a learner can be anywhere along the continuum. For example, it has been shown that children can recognize and list several color terms before they can identify the colors to which the terms apply. In a similar way, we may know that waistcoat, muffler, bermudas, housecoat, and Birkenstocks refer to items of clothing without being able to identify the items.

Furthermore, knowledge about words may include information that may cause learners to choose not to produce them. For example, we may understand terms used by speakers of other dialects, but never choose to use them. Likewise, we may recognize such nonstandard and slang expressions as "done deal" or "no way," but studiously avoid saying them for social or other reasons. Thus, it appears that the receptive/productive division is not a simple dichotomy nor a simple knowledge continuum, but is probably related to both a knowledge continuum and a \*selfimage" continuum. Knowing vocabulary may, therefore, also consist of knowing enough to use words which represent the image we wish others to have of us. Any theory or model of vocabulary learning must account for these different levels of knowledge about and use of words.

# Practice 15.1

1. Read the first chapter of a textbook on any subject on which you are not an expert. Write down any terms which are new to you or seem to be used in a new way. How many of those terms are explicitly defined in the chapter? How many do you think you couid define even though they are not defined in the chapter? What can you say about the strength of intentional and incidental teaching and leaming on the basis of this exercise? How much of learning a subject seems to be learning the vocabulary of that subject?   
2. Select two lessons at random out of each book in a textbook series for a language you hope to teach. How many words does each teach explicitly (intentionally)? If learners learned every word taught explicitly, how many words would they know once they had finished one year of the series? The entire series?   
3. Read Saragi, Nation, and Meister's (1978) study using A Clockwork Orange, or Pitts, White, and Krashen's (1989) replication with L2 learners, or Yun's (1989) study using Tom Sawyer. Try replicating one ot these with ESL learners you are acquainted with.

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

4. In a game called Category, the leader names a category -- flowers, furniture, items of clothing, jazz singers, etc. - and then at a particular point in a rhythmical clapping each person in the circle in turn has to name some thing or some person which fits in the category (rose, daisy, petunia, etc.. for the category "flowers"). Try playing this game with some friends using categories that do not include names of persons or other proper nouns. How many of the item names do you recognize readily as fitting in the category without knowing enough to distinguish them completely trom other items in the category? How many of the items do you know thoroughly so you could pick them out of the group of everything named?

5. Ask individuals if they can think ot any words in their native language that they never use. Ask them what reasons they have for not using these words. How many of the reasons relate to a possible lack of knowledge? How many of them relate to the image the person is trying to portray? Are there other reasons people choose not to use words productively? Do you think the receptive/productive dichotomy is real for native speakers? Now ask individuals who speak a second language to think of any words in the second tanguage that they never use. Are their reasons for not using the words the same as the ones native speakers give? Is the issue of receptive and productive vocabulary the same for second language learners as it is tor native \$peakers?

# Five essential steps in vocabulary learning

Teachers have always been naturally interested in how learners go about learning vocabulary. If we know more about learner strategies and what works and what does not work well, we can help learners acquire more profitable strategies. Intuitively, we have always given advice about how to learn vocabulary. Some teachers even make assignments for this purpose. For example, "Write down every new word you encounter in a notebook. Try to guess whar it means in the context in which you heard it." Or, "Try to use any new words you learn as soon as you learn them. In fact, I want you to write me ten sentences tonight using new words you have learned."

Payne (1988) made a more formal study of vocabulary learning strategies used by ESL students. She began by asking seventeen ESL students randomly selected from an intensive English program what strategies they used to learn vocabulary. All but the highest level srudents were interviewed in their native language in order to be sure that students could explain their strategies as they desired. The answers to this open-ended question were transcribed and Payne devised a questionnaire containing thirty-two statements, each of which described a strategy mentioned by the students who had been interviewed. This questionnaire was then administered to more than 100 ESL students asking them to rate how effective they thought each described strategy was for them. Using Payne's data, Brown and Payne (1994) did an analysis that resulted in a very clear model where the strategies fall into five essential steps: (1) having sources for encountering new words, (2) getting a clear image, either visual or auditory or both, for the forms of the new words, (3) learning the meaning of the words, (4) making a strong memory connection between the forms and meanings of the words, and (5) using the words.

Although the steps identified by Brown and Payne may possibly be divided into smaller components, it appears to us that each represents something learners must do, at least at some minimal level, to come to a full productive knowledge of words. (It may be that step $\pmb { \mathscr { s } }$ is not absolutely essential if the goal is purely receptive knowledge.)

The steps might be seen as a series of sieves as illustrated in Figure 15.1. If learners or teachers can do anything to move more words through any of the steps, the overall result should be more vocabulary learned. The five processes are described in more detail below.

# Encountering new words

The first essential step for vocabulary learning is encountering new words, that is, having a source for words. The student strategies here included "learning new words by reading books," "listening to TV and radio," and "reading newspapers and magazines" (Payne, 1988, p. 33). As far as incidental learning of vocabulary goes, this step is obviously the most vital. Because incidental learning of vocabulary must occur if second language learners are to approach a vocabulary that compares with that of native speakers, this step is cruciai.

How many words make it past this step may vary because of many learner factors. For example, natural learner interest or motivation may cause learners to pay more attention to some words than others. As discussed in Chapter 3, Yoshida's (1978) subject, Miki, learned many words in an area which was of interest to him, finding ways to encounter and learn all kinds of words for vehicles, wild animals, and outdoor objects, but very few for other very common items such as dress, skirt, ring, lamp.

In addition to interest, actual need may make a difference in whether encountered words are learned. We seem to learn words more quickly if

Figure 15.1 Five essential steps to learning new words

we have felt a need for them in some way. LaPorte (1993) looked at words learned by students engaged in dialogue journal writing with their teacher. In several instances students had to use their native language word or a circumlocution to express a concept. When the teacher supplied the second language words for the concept, the students readily picked them up, as the following excerpts from the journals show (the numbers indicate the number of the entry in the journal):

# Student 10

S7: He is living in a pension. The lady encharged of it had a trouble with her heart and he had to take her to the hospital -   
T8: I have to tell you that I got a little confused with the story about your boyfriend's landlady and your relationship in it.   
S9: I see you were little confused about the story of my boyfriend's landlady and our relationship.   
S9: the problem was that have decided to meet that night but as the Iandlady felt bad my boyfriend took her to hospital very late at night.   
59: The landlady's husband was out and knew what happened very late. Student 11   
S4: There most of his family brothers, nieces, nephews, etc. were celebrating this day. Some were dancing cueca and others were doing empanadas and rescoldo which is made of the mass [Spanish

masa means "dough"] of the bread and is put in the hot coals covered with ashes.

T4: Do you put the bread dough directly on the coals and cover it with ashes, or is the dough in some container that you then put on the coals?   
S5: Rescoldo is like an omelet and the bread dough is put directly on the coals and is covered with ashes and with coals, too.

Another indication that encountering words may be more effective under some circumstances than others has been found in work with interactive video materials. When students have seen an object or an action, their desire to know the label (word) for it may increase so that, wben the word for it is encountered, it is learned very quickly. This appeared to be the case in Brown's 1993 study where learners were using an interactive version of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Learners had seen some objects or actions in the video so they had a visual image of them but did not hear or see the vocabulary items until later. Later in the video script or the instructional exercises, the words were supplied for what the learners had seen. These vocabulary items were learned significantly faster than Other words in the script or exercises.

The number of times that a word is encountered may also affect whether it is learned. It appears logical that the need learners feel for a word wouid increase as they continued to encounter it. There is some evidence that learners are sensitive to the frequency with which they encounter both familiar and unfamiliar words. They say such things as "I don't know what that word means, but I've seen it a lot," or \*"I've never seen that word before."

Nagy and Herman (1987) have argued that "even a single encounter with a word in context" might help increase learner's knowledge about that word and its meaning. Likewise, in first language learning, Jenkins and Dixon (1983) have argued that between six and twelve encounters with a word were necessary to ensure that the word would be learned. However, Brown (1993) found no connection between the words that were acquired and the number of occurrences of those words in the source text. Instead, there was a small (.20) but important correlation between the words acquired and their general frequency (as given in Francis & Kucera, 1982). Learners may need various encounters with the same word in multiple sources rather than in just one source.

Reading is not the only way in which learners encounter words. The learners in Payne's study frequently mentioned watching television and listening to the radio as good ways to learn vocabulary. Living with speakers of the language one is trying to learn is also important. As teachers of second (not foreign) languages, we are continually amazed at the vocabulary questions which come from our college students living in the dormitories. Also, we have known learners with the personal strategy to go out and speak with native speakers until they have encountered a certain number of new words every day.

Other strategies may not be as personally interactive and interesting, but they do serve learners. For example, textbook or teacher-assigned word lists are sources where learners may encounter new words. Lehr (1984) claims that the word list is probably the most widely used approach to vocabulary development in formal settings, and most textbooks, particularly those used in foreign language settings, provide chap. ter word lists, end glossaries, or both.

Dictionaries are also sources where new words and new uses for old words can be encountered. Recent work in progress in Hong Kong by Yongqi Gu followed the reading and dictionary use of students and found that the better learners used the dictionary extensively to learn not just the words they originally started to look up but also related words or words nearby in the dictionary.

Other teachers have suggested that students be encouraged to generate their own word lists. Such lists are very easily compiled by students learning a language but may not be quite as easily generated in foreign Ianguage environments. As students notice where they encounter foreign words, they can begin to see some of the issues related to variation in lexical choice. In Japan, for example, many French words are found in fashion ads, and English words abound in music- and entertainmentindustry-related products. Students would also learn that words encountered on t-shirts nay differ from the words encountered on food product or technological instrument labels and instructions.

Continued work with sources may clarify what sources or characteristics of sources are most desirable, but for now it is quite clear that learners have to encounter words in textbooks or out before they can learn them.

# Practice 15.2

1. Have classmates or friends list two topics of great interest to them and two topics in which other people have interest but they do not. Then give them a few minutes to write down as many words as they can on each of the topics. Are there differences in the quantity of words they write about the topics they are interested in and those they are not? Ask how they learned the words about the topics which interested them. Then try the same thing with your language learners having them write words for the topics in the language they are learning. How different are their lists for the topics of interest and the topics without interest? How did they learn the words for their topics of interest?

2. Ask some of your language learners if they know of times when they wanted to express a particular idea or concept for which they did not have the words. What did they do, if anything, to get the words? Do any of them recount stories of circumlocuting on the spot and then tinding the words they needed later? Do any of them have ideas or concepts for which they still don't have the second language words? Can you tell why? Can you think of sources where they might have learned the words they want?

3. Using a word frequency list such as that ot Francis and Kucera (1982) for English, choose twenty words that come from twenty different levels of frequency in another language of your choice. Give the list (without any marking of frequency) to native speakers of the language and ask them to rank them in order from the most frequent to the least frequent. Give the same list to nonnative learners of the language and have them do the same thing. How accurate are both groups? For iterns which seem to be quite out of order, ask your subjects why they ranked them as they did.

4. Make a list of all possible sources for encountering new target language words which your learners might use in a second language environment and rate them for which ones you think would be best in terrns of quantity of words encountered. Then, do the same thing tor encountering target language words in the foreign language environment. How do the two lists differ? Now, ask your learners about where they encounter most of the words they leam. Are there some sources they are not using that you could teach them to use profitably? Are there some sources they are using which you could suggest to other learners?

5. Open your dictionary at random and read a definition for a word. Do you also automatically glance at nearby words to see what new and interesting other words you might learn? if learners who use dictionaries also look at words around the word they have looked up, would it be better if these nearby words were semantically related to the word they had first looked up? The Oxford Advanced Learners' Dictionary (Hornby) and the Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English (McArthur) group related words under semantic headings. How might you determine whether such groupings are helpful for learners who like to browse after looking up a word?

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

# Getting the word form

The second step essential to vocabulary learning appears to be the getting of a clear image -- visual or auditory or both - of the form of the vocabulary item. This step was shown in comments such as "associating new words with words that sound similar in my native language," "writing the sounds of words using sound symbols from my native language,' "associating words that are similar to words in other languages I have studied," "associating a word with a similar sounding English word I know," and "seeing a word that looks like another word I already know" in this step.

The importance of having a clear image of the "form" of a word becomes apparent when we think about what happens when we try to retrieve words. The classic study in this area was done by Brown and McNeill (1966). Definitions of words with very low frequency were read to the participants and the participants were asked to write down what they tbought the word might be. When they could not think of the word, they were asked to write down what they could remember. When the target was a "flat-bottomed boat used in rivers along the coast in Southeast Asia," responses including saipan, Siam, Cheyenne, sarong, sympoon, sanching, houseboat, barge, and junk were supplied. Many of these share sounds and the two-syllable length with sampan, the target-word. Brown and McNeill concluded that initial sound, final sound, and number of syllables were ail aspects used to retrieve words from memory. A similar study done by Brown (1983) with second language learners had similar results. Learners also seemed to give a higher than average number of guesses with the correct initial sound, final sound, and number of syllables for words that were on the tip-of-the-tongue. There were also indications that the form of native language words affected the search for the target language words.

The importance of getting the form of the word also appears when students are asked to give definitions for words. Beginning students are particularly likely to make mistakes that are obviously related to confusions of the form of one word with the form of other words. In one experiment students were given an English sentence with one word underlined and were asked to write their native language translation of the word. Their translations were then backtranslated to English. Table 15.1 shows some of the words for which the students were attempting to give translations and what the backtranslations of their words were (the persons who did the backtranslation had not seen the original sentences nor test words).

Many of the errors seem to be caused by, or related to the confusing of words similar in form either to a native language word or to another English word.

TABLE 15.1 BACKTRANSLATIONS OF LEARNERS' NATIVE LANGUAGE DEFINITIONS

The use of word form can also be seen in a study by Huckin and Bloch (1993), in which three native Chinese-speaking subjects were given two English texts to read. Twenty-seven words from the texts had been chosen as "test" words, which the learners were less likely to know, and the subjects had been pretested on these words. The subjects were then asked to translate the texts into Chinese while "thinking aloud" in either English or Chinese about what they were doing. Huckin and Bloch found thar the learners were able to use context to define and translate correctly twenty-five of the possible forty-four words they did not know (twentyseven words by 3 students minus the words already known on the pretest). They were unsuccessful in their guessing nineteen out of the fortyfour times, and nine of those times \*they apparently mistook the word for another that resembles it (e.g., pillars for appliers)" (p. 160). All of these errors indicate that learners are often led astray in their attempts to understand words because they confuse the form of the word with anOther form.

Problems for learners arising from words similar in form have been identified as a major problem for language Iearners and given the name synophones by Laufer (1981). In a lexical error analysis, Teemant (1988)

# Vocabuiary, semantics, and language education

also found form confusion to account for about one fourth of all errors. In this study, the language background of the students was an important factor. Spanish and Portuguese native speakers had many more form confusions than Japanese native speakers. Teemant felr that this aspect of vocabulary learning was harder for the learners whose languages used the Roman alphabet because of confusions with words and spellings in their native language. Japanese words were so different in form that fewer written form confusions resulted. Whatever the reason for the confusion of the learners, it is obvious that learning the form is important. Almost all learners seem to have strategies, such as those listed above, that they automatically use to help them remember the form of foreign language words.

# Practice 15.3

1. As you teach a foreign language class, identify lexical errors that your students make. Record each error and its context. Then also record your best guess as to what the learner was trying to communicate. If possible, find out what the lexical item would be for that concept in the learner's native language. What percentage of the errors can be attributed to a confusion with a similar looking or sounding word in the target language? What percentage can be attributed to a confusion with a similar looking or sounding word in the native language? What kind of teach. ing strategies might help your students?

2. Researchers into the reading processes in the first language looked at word identification issues in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Read Kenneth Goodman's (1969 or 1973) work on miscue analysis or Frank Smith's (1969 or 1988) work on word identification. Then, record a group of your friends or students reading aloud a passage in your target language. Listen to the reading and idertify occasions when the readers either say a wrong word or start to say an incorrect word and then backtrack and correct the word. How many of the mistakes seem to be caused by the grammatical structure? How many of them seem to be caused by mistaking one word tor a similar looking word? What do Goodman's and Smith's findings and methodology and your own study teach you about the intluence of form on how students identify words in context?

3. Read Ringbom's (1987) work or Nash's (1978) work discussed in Chapter 6, and Singleton and Little's experiment discussed in Chapter 4. What evidence is there in these works that word form affects vocabulary learning and use? would you predict that word form would have more or less effect on vocabulary learning for your students than it had tor the Swedish, Finnish, and Spanish users of English and the English learners of French that these works discuss?

4. The tip-of-the-tongue experiments show that we use phonological cues (i.e., it starts with a $k -$ , it sounds something like, it's a long word) in attempting to retrieve words. Baker (1974) asked participants to do a retrieval task based on the sounds of words by listening to a word and trying to match it. We will try the task with printed words instead. As soon as you read the word, try to think of as many like words as you can that have the same initial, medial, or final sound.

Group 1: same vowel sound as the word given bone tick cake   
Group 2: same initial consonant boy fan cone   
Group 3: same final consonant rim mass cab   
Group 4: same number of syllables survival hippopotamus desk   
Group 5: same medial consonant ladder mileage final   
Group 6: same part of speech sit yetlow quick   
Group 7: same last syllable hunter photo lesson

Stress and rhyme probably influence the number of words you think of in many of the categories. In order to get the same medial consonant, and the same vowel, you probably relied on rhyme with the test word. Again, what happened to the medial parts of words in your attempts to Supply words?

5. Haynes (1993) reports that in a study where students were supposed to guess the meaning of unknown words in context, one of her subjects mispronounced the word waves and then guessed that it meant "the opposite of 'husbands'" (p. 54). Look at the words given in Table 15.1 and those that you collected for item 1. Are there any in which mispronunciation may have played a role? What might be

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

said about the relationship of pronunciation and vocabulary learning?

6. In Puilet Surprises (Green, 1969), randomly select ten to twenty of the items. What forms did the writers really want for each? In what ways do these form confusions resemble those made by language learners? Are there any differences? Are the native speakers who confused the forms just acquiring these vocabulary words? what other reasons might there be for the confusions? Do any of these reasons apply to second language learners?

# Getting the word meaning

The third essential step in the learners' reported strategies is the one which is most often associated with the idea of vocabulary learning. getting the word meaning. This step includes such strategies as \*asking native English speakers what words mean," "asking people who speak my native language the meaning of new words," "making pictures of word meanings in my mind," and "explaining what I mean and asking someone to tell me the English word."

The specificity of the meaning that learners need may vary. For example, if someone asks, "What's an azalea?" we may reply, \*a type of flower," or, more specificaily, \*a type of honeysuckle," or "the kind of flower or bushes like those pink ones in front of Aunt Mary's house." If we are in a botany class, however, the definition might be as specific as \*a genus of flowering shrubs with funnel-shaped corollas and deciduous leaves. They are from the heath family and related to rhododendrons. There are three commonly cultivated native American species: Azalea nudiflora, Azalea viscosa, and Azalea Iutea."

The level of distinctions that must bc made in word definitions seems to vary both with the requirements of the task or situation and also with the level of the learner. Although beginning learners seem satisfied with quite general meanings, more advanced learners often need more specific definitions in order to differentiate between near synonyms. Similar characteristics are seen in the definitions which mothers supply to children learning their first language. Anglin (1977, 1978) found that adults used general names for objects, such as money in place of nickel or dog instead of collie, when talking to 2-year-olds. Likewise, Mervis and Mervis (1982) found that mothers sometimes gave their 13-month-old children general, but slightly incorrect (by adult standards) labels for objects. For example, the mothers might call a toy leopard a kitty-cat or a toy tow truck a car. Berko-Gleason (1993) observes that these kinds of parental definitions seem to follow what Rosch, Mervis, Gray, Johnson, and Boyes-Graem (1976) have called basic-level categories (see the discussion of basic categories in Chapter 3).

The kinds of definitions given by adults to children change, however, with the age of the children and the words to be learned. Callanan (1985) found that mothers of 2- to 4-year-olds used a lot of pointing to teach basic level words, but gave lists of objects to teach superordinate terms (e.g., "a car and a bus and a train. All of them are kinds of vehicles").

Language learners may also need different kinds of definitions and distinctions depending on the words being learned and the reasons for needing them. Advanced learners may find thesauruses more appropriate than dictionaries in supplying the finer distinctions in meaning that thcy need. Table 15.2 shows some of the errors advanced ESL learners made with native language translations for English words (thc errors in Table 15.1 came from the same set of data, but generally from lower level students.)

Learners often get close to the meaning of the English words, choosing meanings that have some of the features (see Chapter 1) of the test word, but not all. For example, a windshield is a window, but it is a particular kind of window. Upon, as used in the test sentence, does relate to time but it does not mean since, after, once, or $\boldsymbol { b } \boldsymbol { y }$ in this context. Strong and hard share some features with heavy, but are also distinct in several ways. Likewise, a path is not a footbridge, an entrance, nor a road, but it shares some characteristics with those things.

The data in Table 15.2, which come mainly from intermediate or more advanced learners, indicate that the learners know some things about the vocabulary, but they also seem to indicate the need to refine meanings for words, to make finer distinctions, which thesauruses generally do better than regular dictionaries. Doing feature analyses might help learners in their attempts to get the meaning of the words they are learning.

Most teachers know, however, that learners assume that dictionaries are one of the main sources of word definitions. After all, language learners carry around dictionaries, not grammar books. If learners carry dictionaries, however, it would seem wise for them to have the best possible dictionary. Oskarsson (1975) carried out experiments to see what kind of glossaries (and, hence, dictionaries) were most helpful to students. He found that students receiving bilingual glosses (oral or written) scored consistently higher on vocabulary tests (both written cloze tests and oral interviews about texts which had been read) than students who received monolingual glosses. In one experiment, the scores of students using a monolingual glossary were only $7 8 \ \mathrm { t o } \ 8 4$ percent of scores by those who received bilingual glosses. There seems to be natural progression in the type of dictionaries or glosses that learners prefer. They seem to go from picture dictionaries, to bilingual dictionaries, and then to monolingual dictionaries and thesauruses.

Another way of getting definitions is simply by having a bilingual friend or a teacher explain. Research into ways in which teachers present academic information in classes for native speakers and classes in "sheltered English" (where international students as a group take an academic content class) has shown that native speakers naturally make adjustments and supply clarifications and definitions for nonnative speakers. The usefulness of these clarifications is not always certain, however. Chaudron (1983, 1988) has shown that learners are sometimes more confused than helped by such explanations. We will discuss this further in Chapter 16.

Finally, one very popular (with language pedagogues at least) way and practicaily the only way in incidental learning for learners to get the meaning of words is through context. Learners guess the meaning of words from the situation, discourse, and/or context in which they are used, and from the structure of the words themselves. Haynes (1993) found that "guessing" was one of only two principles urged in all of the reading textbooks she examined. In order to see the effectiveness of such guessing, Haynes had ESL students read passages and guess at the meaning of unfamiliar words. Each passage contained two nonsense words which replaced all occurrences of two real words. The nonsense words were included in order to ensure that students would encounter words they could nor have known from any other source. The only way they could tell what the words meant would be through context and word structure. The meaning of one of the nonsense words in each passage could be guessed from the clues jusr within the sentence in which it occurred (Haynes calls this "locally constrained"). Guessing the meaning of the other nonsense word required synthesizing information from throughout the passage (Haynes calls this "globally constrained").

Haynes found that all the learners were much more successful at guessing the meaning of locally constrained words than the globally constrained words. She aiso found that guessing success depended a great deal on the number of other unfamiliar words in the passage.

Although the depth of definition needed may vary and the sources from which meaning can be extracted may be quite different, all learners must get the meaning of words in some manner, or the words can never be considered truly learned.

# Practice 15.4

1. There are arguments about what role pictures (and other visual aids) have in promoting vocabuiary acquisition. Try using a pictorial gloss for a selection of words with one group of your students and a bilingual gloss with another. Which group do you think will retain the meanings longer? (This project might be done as an over the summer attrition project.) Which of the many picture dictionaries do you think is most useful? Justity your choice of pictures and use your survey of dictionaries as part of the literature review for your project (or prepare an article giving your evaluation of the dictionaries).

2. Using tapes that you recorded previously in language classes, identify words for which teachers give explicit definition or clarifications. What, if any, indications are there on the tapes that these clarifications helped the students? Are there any indications that some of the clarifications may have caused more confusion? Can you see any characteristics that make one type of clarification more helpful than another?

3. Whiskeyman (1990) developed interactive videodisc materiais where students could stop the flow of intormation to find meanings of words or phrases. The "helps' in this program are in the target language not in the students' L1. The first help layer gives intormation on the meaning of the word. The second help is a sound or graphic illustration. The third might be more graphics or an animated sequence. Students click on the question mark symbol in order to get the helps. For example, the help in the first help cue might be:

a. A synonym: igual $\eqcirc$ los mismo (Equa) $=$ the same)

b. A definition: Pana es una tela de algodon. (Corduroy is a cotton material.)   
c. An explanation: Un paraguas es para la lluvia. (An umbrella is for the rain.)   
d. A simile or metaphor: Una blusa es como una camisa pero es para una mujer. (A blouse is fike a sh/rt, but tor a woman.)   
e. A category: Un saco es un articulo de ropa. (A suitcoat is a piece of clothing.)

The help in the second help cue for this last item might be a picture of a suitcoat and the help in the third might be an animated sequence showing a man buying a suitcoat.

Select a short article from the popular press in a language you are studying or teaching. Mark the words or phrases where you or your students could use a help button. Then consider the kinds of helps that would be most useful and include this information. If you use Hypercard or Supercard or Toolbook, you might want to prepare a short computer lesson using your materials.

4. Choose a passage you want your students to read. Starting with the second sentence, mark every mth (tenth, fifteenth, or twentieth) word. Then re-examine the passage looking for any context cues which might give hints to the definitions of the marked words. For how many words can you find context cues? Which would you consider locally constrained cues and which would you consider globally constrained cues? If students knew all of the words in the passage except the ones you marked, what percentage of the marked words do you think they would be able to guess from context? what wouid happen to the ability of students to use contextual cues if they knew only about 60 percent of the other words?

5. Pullet Surprises (Green, 1969) shows that students are often trying to figure out the meanings of words based on their forms. For example, the word risibility sounds like visibility and some students defined it as "how far an aviator can see." But others defined it as the "ability to rise in the world." A student wno thinks bronchitis is saddle soreness uses both processes - the sound similarity with bronco and the knowledge that itis has to do with illness. In the following quiz, rnatch a student definition from the second column with a word in the first column. Then explain your choice.

# Consolidating word form and meaning in memory

The fourth necessary step revealed by Brown and Payne's analysis requires the consolidation of form and meaning in memory. Many kinds of vocabulary learning drills, such as flashcards, matching exercises, crossword puzzles, etc., strengthen the form-meaning connection. Almost all of the ten memory strategies that Oxford (1990) mentions consolidate the connection between word form and meaning in memory. Oxford divides these strategies into four general categories: (1) creating mental linkages, (2) applying images and sounds, (3) reviewing well, and (4) employing actions. Nine specific memory strategies Oxford mentions, along with the general categories in which they fall, are:

1. Grouping language material into meaningful units (category 1)   
2. Associating new language information to concepts already in memory (category 1)   
3. Placing new words into a context, such as a meaningful sentence, conversation, or story (category 1)   
4. Using semantic mapping (category 2)   
5. Using keywords with auditory and/or visual links (category 2)   
6. Representing sounds in memory in such a way that they can be linked with a target language word in order to remember it better (category 2)   
7. Reviewing the target language material in carefully spaced intervals (category 3)   
8. Acting out a new target language expression (category 4)   
9. Using mechanical techniques, such as writing words on cards and moving cards from one stack to another when a new word is learned (category 4)

Many of these strategies specifically mention vocabulary, expressions, or words. Those that do not mention vocabulary explicitly still can be applied to vocabulary study, for example, reviewing at carefully spaced intervals.

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

Mnemonic devices and their uses have been studied extensively by researchers (see, for example, Cohen and Aphek [1981]). One method in particular, the keyword method, has received great attention. This method calls for the word to be learned in a sentence that gives contextual cues to the meaning of the word while relating the form to forms the learner already knows. Jenkins and Dixon (1983) describe the method as having two stages: In the first, students are taught to link an unfamiliar word with an acousticaliy or visually similar word (e.g., persuade -- purse). Next the students are shown a picture which contains both concepts in an interactive display. For instance: Two women are pictured in a store. One states, "Oh, Martha, you should buy that purse (pointing to a purse), and the second replies, "I think you can persuade me to buy it." Beneath the picture is the statement \*Persuade (Purse) - when you talk someone into doing something" (p. 242). Supposedly the story or sentences with or without the picture will make the meaning of persuade clear. The pronunciation of the word is remembered because of its association with the known word, purse. If all of the learners in a language class have the same L1, the keywords can be done in the L1, as in the following example for native English speakers learning the Spanish word pato (adapted from Cohen, 1987):

1. Students are shown a picture of a duck with a pot over its head.   
2. Students hear, mayhe see, and learn the sentence, "The duck has a pot over its head."   
3. Because the image is a silly one, and the sentence contains the equivalent sounding English words for the Spanish word (English pot o$\equiv$ Spanish pato), the learner may more easily recall the phonetic form and the meaning of the Spanish word and be able to produce it.

If the class has a heterogeneous language background, the keywords and sentences must be in the L2. In addition to deciding which language to do keywords in, learners or teachers may need to decide whether verbal or visual (imagery) mnemonics are more effective and whether learner-generated or teacher-supplied mnemonics are more helpful. With regard to verbal or visual mnemonics, Cohen (1987) cited mixed results depending on whether the words to be learned represented concrete or abstract items (verbal mnemonics were better for abstract items), on the age of the learner (younger children could not seem to generate visual images as easily), and on learner fluency (more fluent learners benefit more from verbal mnemonics).

With regard to whether mnemonics should be generated by the learner or the teacher, Cohen cited studies which generally showed that either ethod worked equally well. Cohen did point out, however, that almost all experiments had used words for which keywords were easy to generate.

The difficulty of generating keywords may discourage learners, or they may simply opt for more traditional ways of consolidating word forms with word meanings. Probably the most traditional way of doing this is to memorize words and their meanings from lists. There are variations on this method - using flashcards, covering one side of the paired lists (words and their meanings) and trying to guess the other, drawing lines hetween words in one list and their meanings in another list with a different order - but many cultures or educational systems simply call for students to memorize a list with the word and its meaning paired. Although this method may not be as entertaining as others, there are sufficient persons who have learned languages in this way so that the method should not be discounted.

Which method learners use for this step does not seem to be as crucial as that they do it. The more words learners can get through this step, the more words they will know overall.

# Practice 15.5

1. Ask a group of your students or your classmates what mnemonic or memory devices they have used in learning second language vocabulary. Do all of them connect the form and the meaning in some way? Compare what your students say with the kinds of strategies in Oxford (1990). Does Oxford include any strategies that your students are not using? Do your students include any strategies that Oxford has not listed?

2. After you have compiled a list ot at least 10 strategies in item 1 from many people, show the list to people (either the people from whom you got the original ideas for the list or a completely new group) and have them categorize the strategies into four categories: (a) those they have thought of before and tried, (b) those they have thought of before but never tried, (c) those they had not thought of betore and want to try, and (d) those they had not thought of betore and do not want to try. Have them rank the techniques they place in categories (a) and (c) in order from most useful to least useful. Ask them to give reasons for their ranking and for why they have not or would not want to try the techniques in categories (b) and (d).

3. Compile a list of ten words you would like to learn or would like your students to learn. See if you can invent keyword sentences in English to help remember the words and their meanings. What problems or successes do you encounter with the method?

4. Use the same list you compiled in item 3, but this time try to invent keyword sentences in another language you are familiar with. What problerns or successes do you now encounter with the method? What are the differences between the use of L1 and L2 keyword sentences?   
5. Have your language students read a newspaper article, short story, or article in the target language, circling all of the words they do not know for sure. After reading, have the students use any method they prefer for finding the meaning of the circled words. Teach them how to invent keyword sentences for their words and then let them try the method for half of their circled words. How well do the students invent the keyword sentences? wait a rmonth or so and then test the students on all of the words they had circled. Compare their scores on the words for which they invented keyword sentences with their scores on the words for which they did not invent keyword sentences. Is the difference worth the tirne used in inventing the sentences?   
6. Get a classmate or friend who speaks a language you do not know to write a list of twenty common items and their meanings in that language. See how quickly you can memorize the list and then get your friend to test you to be sure that you know the words. Were some words on the list easier to learn than others? why? Did you find that you used any kind of mnemonic devices as you learned the words? If so, which devices did you use? Why?

# Using the word

The final step in learning words is using the words. Some would argue that this step is not necessary if all that is desired is a receptive knowledge of the word. Such an argument can apply to many of the other processes as well, since a great amount can be comprehended in context even if a reader or listener knows nothing about many of the words being used. However, if the goal is to help learners move as far along the continuum of word knowledge as they can, word use is essential. Furthermore, use seems to provide a mild guarantee that words and meanings will not fade from memory once they are learned.

Possibly because the use of a word tests the learner's understanding of the word, learners feel more confident about their word knowledge once they have used a word without undesired consequences. Use of the word may simply be a form of hypothesis testing, allowing learners to see if the knowledge gained in the other steps is correct. Sugawara demonstrated this fact in her 1992 study in which she pretested the vocabulary knowledge and confidence about that knowledge of ESL subjects. In the study, Sugawara had students view a video and then complete one of three tasks: write short paragraphs answering questions about the video trying to use certain specified words in the answers; complete a cloze exercise where the video script was the text and a list of possible words (the same specified words as in the first task) were supplied as options for filling in the blanks; write a short essay about the video in their own language (students who completed this task were considered the \*"no treatment" group).

When all the students had completed one of the three procedures, Sugawara gave them three posttests which were the same as the pretests they had completed before seeing the video. One was a test of confidence, where students marked how confident they felt about knowing the words being tested. The other two were a receptive (multiple-choice) vocabulary test and a productive test. The group who actually used the word in answering questions about the video did better than the other two groups on all three tests. Sugawara concluded that having students use the new words at least once was likely to lead to increased use of the words eventually because of the greater confidence which the students had in their word knowledge.

In addition to increasing confidence and receptive knowledge, use of words seems to be necessary for students to test their knowledge of collocations, syntactic restrictions, and register appropriateness as discussed in the chapters in Part III. Crow and Quigley (1985) have suggested that learners may not know such things when they have only a receptive knowledge of vocabulary.

In this section, we have discussed five essential steps which learners take in vocahulary learning. Although there is a broad range of activities, strategies, or techniques that individuals use at each step, the necessity of the steps seems more constant. Learners need all five in order to have a full knowledge of the words they want to learn.

# Practice 15.6

1. Examine textbooks for a language you are trying to teach or learn to see what kinds of vocabulary exercises they contain. What use of the words being learned do the exercises require students to make? How helpful would the exercises be in helping students acquire collocational knowledge, syntactic restrictions, and register appropriateness for the words? What other aspects of word knowledge might be influenced by these exercises?

Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

2. Haggard (1980) found that people were more likely to remember learning words when they had had a strong (usualy negative) emotion associated with the word. Frequently the emotion was embarrassment because of a mistake with the word or because the word was obscene. Other times the emotion associated with the use ot the word was one of "belonging' because the word was considered "adult" or a marker ot group identity of some sort. Poll your students and triends to see what words they remember iearning in their native languages and why they remember learning them. Do their memories about leaming words have strong emotional attachments? Are there any differences in memories about learning tirst languages besides English? Now, poll your students and friends about what words they remember learning in their second Ianguage and why they remember learning these words. How do the second language memories match those in the tirst? How are they different? How many of the memories are related to use of the word and how many are only related to the hearing or seeing of the word?

3. Record your students in conversation with native speakers of the language they are trying to learn. Listen to the conversations and identify lexical errors that your students make. How many of them do the native speakers correct? How many of the corrections are recognized or acknowledged by the nonnatives? What fypes of refinement in word knowledge are possible from the corrections which are made? What kinds of refinement are not possible?

# Learner compensation strategies

Selinker (1972) coined the term "interlanguage" and discussed how learners had communication strategies that they used to make up for what they sometimes lacked in linguistic knowledge. This section discusses how these communication strategies or compensation strategies, as Oxford (1990) calls them, are used when learners do not have the vocabulary they need at a particular moment.

Using a picture description task, Tarone (1977, 1980) collected data and examined the communication strategies which her Mandarin-, Spanish-, and Turkish-speaking ESL learners used. After eliciting the descrip. tive data, Tarone asked the learners to review their performance on the task by listening to a recording. As they went over the task again, they gave retrospective comments on their strategies. Based on the data, Tarone devised an initial typology of strategies. The strategies include avoidance, paraphrase, conscious transfer, appeal for assistance, and mime. Avoidance was shown in topic avoidance and also by message abandonment. Tarone listed approximations (pipe for waterpipe), word coinage (airball for balloon), and circumlocution as types of paraphrase. Conscious transfer categories included literal translation from the L1, and language shift. Although some of these strategies might also fall under the category of the vocabulary learning processes (e.g., appeal for assistance), the majority are principally ways of coping when the learner does not have the necessary vocabulary (or grammar) for production.

Glahn's (1980) study shows somewhat different strategies. In this study, learners of French described eight pictures to each other. The learners were then asked to listen to their performance, stopping the tape whenever they wished to comment. The strategies revealed in their comments included waiting for the term to appear, appealing to formal similarity, retrieval by semantic field analysis (where they said aloud words from the same field in an attempt to retrieve the word), searching other languages, consulting the learning situation (mentaily looking up the place they encountered the word such as the chapter on French cooking to find mouton), and sensory procedures (such as staring at the floor to find a word for ground).

In previous chapters we have given numerous examples where learners struggle to find the right term in the new language. In conversational analysis, these searches are often negotiated between learners, between native speakers, or between native speakers and learners. The emphasis in these studies is on the interactive building of meanings (and the nature of repair - that is, of self correction and other correction). Yet if we look at examples from such studies we can see many of the learner strategies discussed here. In the following example, Mari and Hamid are talking about an amusement park, and Mari seems to be searching for the word ferris wheel:

Mari: .. . for junior high school? or adults because Iclaps hands that's uh many kind lof Jlooks up and flutters cyclids, purses lips uhh (1.0) mmmmm closes eyes, grits teeth jopens hands, looks at H. ((1.5) lexample Jet Corso? looks away, hands in lap ghands up land uh mmmm Water Shoot? looks back at H. Jcloses eyes, fingers moving (very, very mmmm (1.0) ve:ry

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

Hamid: inter [esting]   
Mari: yeah interesting and Ifingers in circle motion jiconic gestures Ihuh huh huh IJet Corso is uh very fast.   
Hamid: Yeah like merry-go-round   
Mari: Not- not merry-go-round because (.2) Igestures over shoulder Iwe are- we are (.2) opposite. (Data source: Schwartz, 1980, pp. 143-144)

Notice Mari's heavy use of mime to make the meaning clear. She gives the names of two other related rides but indicates that these are not quite right. Hamid then supplied the name of a related ride, merry-go-round, but it, too, is rejected with gestures to show that the ride Mari is thinking of entails sitting across from one another. This example, then, shows data similar to Glahn's category (c), semantic field analysis, and Tarone's category of mime.

Haastrup (1991) also used a discourse analysis perspective in analyzing the "think-aloud" (introspection) and "retrospect" data obtained from paired Danish learners of English. Each pair discussed test words in reading passages. The following record of a think-aloud conversation illustrates the many ways learners guess at meanings. The passage is about a military leader with insatiable political ambitions.

Test word: insatiable

A: Able mans being able to - insane - ins   
B: I think it is a positive word - something with extremely great   
A: What does sati mean   
B: Satanic   
B: There is also a negation - it is something with in - they couldn't be calmed down   
A: Why do you think it is a negation?   
B: It usually is with in - I mean the prefix   
A: He sounds as if he is rather single-minded   
A: In-sa-ti- okay - in- is something with   
B: It is a negation - it is something with u  
B: This is a good word - oh by the way sati is related to satisfy   
A: Yes he has not yet been satisfied.   
(They agree on) not satisfied.

(Haastrup, 1991, p. 127)

The learners use morphological information (e.g., -able means being able to; in- means negation), sounds or forms of the lexical item (e.g., satimight be related to satanic or satisfy), semantics (e.g., it is a positive word), and the discourse or text (e.g., he sounds rather single-minded). The learners do not try one strategy - for example, morphology - and once that is complete, turn to examine the lexical form. Rather, they use all sources of information simultaneously.

As illustrated earlier, there are a wealth of studies of the compensatory strategies learners use when they do not know a word in the L2. The studies show that beginners are more likely to use L1-based strategies and appeals for assistance, whereas more advanced learners are more apt to use approximation and circumlocution. Turian and Altenberg (1991) studied whether the same compensatory strategies occur during attrition of the L1. They describe the attrition data of the Russian-English child, Joseph. Initially a dominantly Russian speaker, he shifted dominance to English when, at age $3 \%$ , the primary language of caretakers and the environment became English. The data include examples of code switching, lexical borrowing (adapting the English word basement to Russian besmInter), innovation (forming an equivalent to the English baby bear by combining medvedi, meaning bears, and deti, meaning children, as medvedeti), approximations, avoidance, and appeals for help. These strategies are similar to those found in most adult second language acquisition studies.

A parallel study exists in Thompson's (1989) analysis of the lexical search strategies used by twenty-four adult learners of Russian (during ACTFL testing sessions). Thompson divides the strategies into L1-based, L.2-based, and cooperative strategies. L1-based strategies include language switching (Congress mog veto), litera! translation (vysokuyu shkolu, tall schooi, for high school), and Russification (adding Russian case endings to English words). L2-based strategies include paraphrase, generalization, coinage, and self-repair (self-correction). Cooperative strategies include requests for hclp, requests for feedback, and admissions of ignorance. Beginning learners used primarily L1-based strategies and advanced learners used more L2-based strategies. All learners used ap. proximately the same number of cooperative strategies.

From these and many other studies, we know that learners and native speakers alike have many ways to compensate for gaps in vocabulary or vocabulary retrieval problems. At points these compensation strategies overlap with the necessary processes for vocabulary learning, and we can speculate about the relative usefulness of the various compensation strategies in terms of both the communication success and the vocabulary learning that they might promote.

# Practice 15.7

1. Galvan and Campbell (1979) wondered whether child L2 learners would use the strategies Tarone found for adults. Data were obtained as English-speaking children in a Spanish immersion class were asked to serve as translators for Spanish-speaking parents who came to enroll their children in school. If you can record similar data with more advanced L2 learners (or learners of a different L2), replicate this study and compare the results.

2. Meisel (1977) lists the following features of German spoken by foreign workers:

a. Use of foreign words, not necessarily of the speaker's native language (e.g., amigo, capito, compris)   
b. German words used in a different sense (e.g., vie! [much] used in the sense of very in vie/ gut and the special kind of negation using nix for nicht as welt as kein (nix geld for no money)   
c. Formal address Sie is replaced by informal address du   
d. Lexical material which is semantically least marked is preterred (e.g., use of machen [to do] for more specialized verbs)   
e. Analytical paraphrases replace what are intuitively judged to be compiex expressions   
t.Decomposition of predicates (e.g., ganze mafioso, mache kaput drei mensche "much mafioso, make kaputt [dead] three men" meaning, "he is a real mafioso, he killed three men")   
g. Missing elements, in particular articles, prepositions, copula, auxiliares, and personal pronouns   
h. Omission of inflectional endings on verbs, adjectives, and nouns   
i. Use of subject pronouns in the imperative   
j.Word order errors   
k. Few complex sentences, and complementizers and relative pronouns may be omitted.

Which of these teatures of learner language relate to lexical compensation strategies? Identify which of the five essential steps the learners seem to have missed so that compensation strategies are necessary.

3. Have pairs of students read a story or article which is chaltenging but not overwhelming tor them. Ask them to mark words for which they are not sure of the meaning. Then have the pairs try to figure out the meaning of the words they have marked. Record their conversations as they do this task. Which strategies do your learners seem to use most? which strategies seem to help them the most (result in correct guesses being made) and which seem to help them the least (result in incorrect guesses being made)?

4. Review the categories used in taxonomies of compensatory strategies of learners (see Turian and Altenberg [1991] for an excellent bibliography). Which categories are the most useful (and why)? How would you recategorize these strategies in terms of what they might contribute to the steps of vocabulary learning?   
5. Review Thompson's (1989) search categories discussed in this section. How might the use of some of these strategies lead to shifts in lexical forms and meanings in immigrant populations? Check with triends who have lived among immigrant populations. Can they give examples of second language learners who have done the kinds of things Thompson discussed? Can they give examples ot differences from the standard target language that the entire immigrant group seems to have adopted?

When language learners have gaps in their lexical knowledge in the language they are learning, they basically have two options (if they do not completely ignore the gap): they can find words to fill the gaps and then go through the five steps of learning them, or they can compensate for the lack of knowledge in a number of ways. Some activities can fit under both of these choices, for example, an appeal for help (which is a compensation strategy) can also be an appeal for someone to supply the meaning of a word. Furthermore, some of the strategies tie significantly to what others do. The next chapter deals with how teachers and other pedagogues can help learners overcome their gaps in lexical knowledge.

# Research and application

1. Sternberg and Powell (1983) noted eight basic kinds of context cues used by high school students when they read and encountered unfamiliar Ll words: temporal, spatial, physical properties, functional properties, worth or affect, causal, class membership, and equivalence. These researchers found that these eight types of cues and several moderating factors (such as frequency of word occurrence) accounted for 72 and 92 percent of the variance in deriving definitions from context. They did not test the relative effect of the different kinds of cues, but they did suggest that multiple contexts increased the number and kind of cues available to students. Design two experiments, one to test the relative effect of the different kinds of cues and one to test whether multiple con

texts increase the number and kind of cues available to learners.

If you have sufficient students, carry out one of the studies. What do you expect to find?   
2. Parry's (1993) subject, Yuko, recorded all the new words she encountered in her reading for her anthropology course. Yuko re. corded 168 words and guessed at the meaning of 148 of them. Thirty-three percent of her glosses were completely correct, and   
36 percent were partially correct. Parry categorized the partially correct glosses into superordinates of the words being glossed. hyponyms of the words being glossed, members of the same superordinate category. part for whole, and whole for part, subtracting meaning from words being glossed, adding meaning to words being glossed, and both adding and subtracting aspects of meaning to the mearing of the words being glossed. Replicate this experiment with students you have who are enrolled in academic classes where they are required to read in the L2 they are learning. How do the percentages of your subjects' correct and incomplete glosses compare with Yuko's? Can you categorize their partially correct glosses into the same categories that Parry used? Would the addition of relational information (such as that discussed in Chapter 4) make the categorization easier?   
3. Cohen and Aphek (198l) studied the specific strategies learners reported using to increase memory. They had native Englishspeaking students use whatever means they desired to learn selfselected unfamiliar words in a Hebrew text. Learners were asked to describe any kind of association used to learn the words. The learners reported using the following nine types of associations:   
a. Associating L2 words to Ll words with a similar sound (e.g. emaher - "he hurries' to hare).   
b. Associating L2 words with other L2 words by sound (e.g., rehov -- street to rehok - far).   
c. Associating one part of a word to an L2 word by sound and meaning, and the other part to an Ll word by sound and meaning (e.g., benatayim -- "meanwhile" with ben associated with Hebrew beyn - 'between" and tayim with Enghish time).   
d. Associating an L2 word to an L1 phrase by sound and meaning (e.g., benatayim -- "meanwhile"' to English been a Iong time).   
e. Associating an L2 word by mearing to a word in a third language (e.g., tox - "inside" to Yiddish tuchus - "backside").   
f. Associating the word with another L2 word according to structure (e.g., Jifney - "before" to lifamim - "sometimes").   
g. Associating by one or more letters (e.g., masa'it - truck -- because names of vehicles often begin with m in Hebrew).

h. Associating the word with a frequently seen sign (la'atsor - "to stop" with the sign atsor - "stop" seen in buses). i. Creating a mental image of the word's referent.

All of the associations except (i) in some way connect word form or some part of it with word meaning. Design your own research plan to investigate the effectiveness of mnemonics that connect form and meaning. How would you select the vocabulary for the project? Would illustrations from picture dictionaries help you in preparing the associations? How might you pilot your materials and methods prior to carrying out the project?

4. Pressley, Levin, and Delaney (l982) surveyed almost fifty studies looking at the use of mnemonic (memory-aiding) devices, in particular the keyword method, and concluded that the method definitely helped vocabulary learning and that it was superior to many other common techniques, such as using pictures, doing rote repetition of words, or simply placing words in meaningful sentences and author adjustments in vocabulary use with learners. Use this article as the basis for your own research. How might you collect data from students about what methods they themselves use (rather than methods the teacher asks them to use)? If the methods that "work" do not match the methods used in independent study, what suggestions would you have?

5. Palmberg (l990) talks about "potential" vocabulary as vocabulary that learners may not yet have encountered but that they would understand. Palmberg also believes that some items may jump directly into active use once they are encountered. In a sense, then, potential vocabulary might jump from step 1 to step 5 without much learner effort. It may also be the case that some words are easily encountered and meanings attached to them but that much effort is needed to move them through steps 3 and 4 to accurate and productive use in step 5. Palmberg suggests that words linked by derivational morphology might fall into this category, using different steps. How might you investigate the notion that some words can be ready for use quickly whereas others take a long time? How miglit you identify which types of words are quickly recognized and quickly brought to use or which types of words are very slowly and often inaccurately used?

6. The importance of vocabulary use for vocabulary retention is discussed by Obler (1982) who compared the naming abihity of monolingual aphasics, polyglot aphasics, demented senior citizens, and healthy senior citizens, Obler found that content words are far more susceptible to loss than function words. Proper nouns are more difficult to retrieve than common nouns, and nouns

Vocabulary, semantics, and language education are more difficult to retrieve than verbs. However, strongly emotional words and phrases (e.g.. "Help!" or "I love you.") are especially impervious to loss. Obler concluded that language use is the key element that facilitates retention in the speech of the elderly and that it is crucial in the treatment of aphasic patients. If the gerontological issues interest you, review this work and also Riegel's (l970) relational semantics model on the loss of types of lexical items in the aging process. Develop a research plan for investigating first language loss of elderly bilinguals in your community.

# 16 Vocabulary pedagogy and teacher strategies

Just as Chapter 15 dealt with what learners do and/or should do to learn vocabulary, this chapter deals with what teachers and other language pedagogical specialists do and should do to help learners. The chapter is divided into two sections - one on unplanned vocabulary adjustments and teaching and one on planned vocabulary adjustments and teaching. In the first section, we will discuss spontaneous vocabulary adjustments that teachers make in order to help students understand vocabulary. Then we will discuss some ways that teachers can turn such spontaneous encounters with unfamiliar vocabulary into "on-the-spot" vocabulary teaching. In the section on planned vocabulary adjustments and teaching, we will look at vocabulary adjustments that materials developers make in order to help learners understand texts or acquire vocabulary. Then we will discuss specific principles for guiding the classroom strategies and techniques of planned formal vocabulary teaching and give examples of how the principles can be applied to judging the value of various vocabulary teaching approaches, methods, or techniques.

# Unplanned vocabulary adjustments and teaching

# Teachers' adjustments in vocabulary

Learners are not the only ones who make adjustments when their vocabuIary is limited -- we as teachers and communicators with the learners often make adjustments, too. Persons studying motherese or caretaker speech have examined the vocabulary adjustments that are made for L1 learners, finding that caretakers had a tendency to use more general terms with children such as calling a leopard a kitty-cat or labeling a tow truck by the more general term car.

In language classrooms, teachers appear to automatically monitor their vocabulary choice, selecting high frequency words, using little slang, and few idioms. They offer definitions either explicitly (e.g., "This means $X$ "It's a kind of $X ^ { \dag }$ ) or implicitly by intonation (e.g., "a triangle?" "It's got three sides?"). In their definitions they sometimes use morphology frames (e.g., "sum up $\twoheadrightarrow$ summarize"), give more common terms (e.g., funds or money, industrious and busy), and add semantic relation information (e.g., HASA relation: \*a database, it has a lot of examples in it"). Or, LOC relation as in, routed, tike at the postoffice. As mentioned earlier, Chaudron's (1982) studies show that vocabulary adjustments are a major component of teacher talk. The relative usefulness of each type of adjustment has not been clearly demonstrated, however. Chaudron showed that many of the definition adjustments that teachers made could result in greater confusion rather than less, some because they broke the natural discourse, others because learners were not able to tell if the teacher's elaboration was a new word or referent or another way to refer to a previous word as tbe following underlined examples demonstrate:

. . the beaver is known as a very industrious and busy, uhm, hard-working animal. . Canada was a - booming - and expanding and economically rich -- , . because of the Depression, because of the economic stuation, because of the society -

(Chaudron, 1982, p. 176, italics added)

Adjusting vocabulary choices and offering definitions at tbe spur of the moment are not examples of intentional vocabulary instruction. Ratber, these adjustments are made in order to make the message clear or to keep the flow of conversation going. They do, however, serve as a possible source for vocabulary learning.

# Practice 16.1

1. Obtain a copy of transcripts of language classrooms. See if you can identify instances when teachers are making definition adjustments for students. How many of these adjustments have the potential to result in greater confusion rather than less? Categorize these "poor' adjustments according to whether they broke the natural discourse or caused confusion because learners were not abte to tell if the teacher's elaboration was a new word or referent or another reference to the previous word. Are there other reasons the adjustments seem unhelpful? Compare your conclusions and findings with those of your classmates.   
2. Mannon (1986) tape-recorded a teacher lecturing (on sound waves) to a class of native speakers and to a class of international students. Do you think that the teacher's use of synonyms or paraphrases following the problematic word would be helptul or confusing for the students? Justity your opinion.

3. Mannon asked other groups of international students to listen either to the taped lecture tor native speakers or to the lecture for international students and then answer a set of intormation questions based on the lecture. The group that listened to the lecture meant for international students answered more questions on the content correctly. Mannon concluded that the adjustments resulted in improved comprehension but she was less sure whether students actually learned vocabulary (or anything else about the language). How might you redesign this study to address the issue of whether the learner acquires more vocabulary when these adjustments are made.

# Unplanned vocabulary teaching

Seal (1991) divides vocabulary teaching into planned and unplanned activities. Unplanned vocabulary teaching happens when the student requests a meaning for a vocabulary item during a lesson or when the teacher realizes that a word that has just come up needs to be clarified. The teacher must improvise on the spot. We are not all equally good at improvising in a way that would promote learning. However, Seal suggests a method he calls the three C's for use in such situations. First, the teacher conveys the meaning, perhaps via mime, synonyms, or an anecdote. Second, the teacher checks that the meaning is understood, perhaps by a series of questions. Third, the teacher consolidates the information by trying to get the students to relate the word to another context or personal experience. To illustrate, Seal uses the example word boring.

# Convey meaning

Teacher: When you go to the movies sometimes the movie is not very interesting, it makes you want to go to sleep. (T puts hand to mouth and yawns.) The movie is very boring. Or sometimes you have a teacher who speaks very slowly and who never makes you laugh and whose Iessons make you go to sleep. The teacher is so boring.

# Check meaning

Teacher: (to S1) Do you like boring teachers? (to S2) Is this lesson boring? (to)

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

S3) Is this book boring? (to S4) Are you a boring person? (to S5) Am I a boring teacher?

Consolidate meaning

Teacher: Turn to the person next to you and ask them if they had a boring weekend. If tbey say "yes," find out wby. (General hubbub) Now ask the person next to you what television shows they think are boring.

No teacher would take this much time away from the lesson without first deciding that the word was important and worth teaching. If the word is low frequency or too specialized, it is better to give a brief definition or none at all. If it is worth teaching, Seal argues that it is worth carrying out all three steps.

If we think of this three C's technique in terms of the vocabulary acquisition sequence discussed in Chapter 15, we can see that the first and second steps deal with the getting of the meaning of the word, and the third step clearly involves the using of the word. The first process, encountering the word, must also have occurred as this is the very trigger that Seal suggests for the implementation of the three C's technique. What is not handled explicitly in this method is the getting of the form of the word and the connecting of the form and the meaning permanently in memory. The teacher might approach the former by writing the word on the blackboard, asking students to say the word, or perhaps spelling the word. The latter step may be more crucial for vocabulary that the teacher intends that the students learn. Ir would be helpful but perhaps difficult to do well in spur-of-the-moment vocabulary teaching.

# Practice 16.2

1. Observe several language classes for learners at different levels of proticiency. For each, note the specitic vocabulary items about which students ask questions. As you observe each class, try to think of how you would answer the questions asked and note how the teacher answers the questions. Can you tell if the answers are satisfactory to the Iearners who asked the questions? Are there any characteristics of answers which you can identify as being more helpful? Compare your notes with those of your classmates. Does the proticiency level of the students make a difference in what kinds of answers are helptul?   
2. Examine some of the classroom recordings which you have made on previous occasions for times when teachers give what appear to be spur-of-the-moment helps with vocabulary. Analyze the spontaneous teaching in terms of Seal's three C's. How many times are all three steps

used? Which step seems to be present most often? Which seems to be missing most often? why do you think this is so? What, if anything, should teachers do in the classroom in order to give greater spontaneous help with vocabulary? 3. in a textbook you are using in one of your classes, have a partner randomly pick a word being used on any page in the textbook and ask you to define it the way you would do it if the question came up in your class. How difficult is it to come up with spontaneous detinitions? Are there any types of words that are more difficult than others to define?

# Planned vocabulary adjustments and teaching

# Materials developers' selections and adjustments in vocabulary

Although teachers must make spontaneous adjustments in vocabulary use and improvise teaching in the classroom, they are also able to take advantage of deliberate adjustments which have been made by textbook authors and editors to help learners. Skierso (1991) notes that "most teachers tend to follow the text's sequence, methodology, pacing, and vocabulary to the letter" (p. 432). It is important for educators to know what kind of vocabulary adjustments are made by these materials developers - to know how vocabulary is selected and in what context it is introduced and reinforced in language teaching materials.

The main issue in materials development is deciding wbat words are basic for language learners. Are these always the simplest, least idiomatic forms? Are they the basic (nor the superordinate or subordinate) level terms? As one way to solve this problem, textbook writers often adopt a basic vocabulary list from some sourcebook such as the old West (1936, reprinted in 1953 and revised in 1971) General Service List, the Thorndike and Lorge (1944) list, or some more up-to-date list based on frequency. Although such sourcebooks contain the most frequent vocabulary in some cross-section of written discourse, they seldom include oral language sources, which can limit their usefulness.

Current popular language teaching methods have influenced and produced other methods or reasons for the choice of vocabulary used and presented in general language textbooks. In the 1950s and 1960s audiolingual textbooks used a set plan for selecting and limiting vocabulary. In addition to a frequency criterion, vocabulary was selected according to an expanding scope for the learners. The lessons began with vocabulary of the classroom, then school, home, community, and work. Later, the list was enlarged to include common vocabulary about the state and the nation. Finally, the scope became communication around the world. This concentric circle approach to theme and vocabulary selection still appears in many ESL and EFL textbooks.

In addition to this expanding scope, writers of audiolingual materials believed that the number of vocabulary items per lesson should be kept to the minimum so that learners would concentrate on pronunciation and grammar. Since contrastive analysis was important during this era, vocabulary was also selected to show contrasts. Many false cognates were highlighted for extra practice.

During the tate 1960s and early 1970s, ESL teaching in the United States turned to more communicative materials and to more directly usable English with such approaches as Survival English, Contextual English, and Situational Reinforcement. Survival English materials, usually produced by school districts, were designed for the immigrant student family. In all of these approaches, the contexts in which the learner would use English were identified and sequence priority was given to contexts that would be crucial for survival purposes in the new country. Vocabulary was selected to match these basic English units, including units on such scripts as obtaining housing, doing banking, shopping, getting a driver's license, and filling out job applications. These approaches are still frcquently used in adult education, Amnesty, and citizenship courses.

Theme-based approaches, still part of the continuing communicative movement and similar to those of Contextual English, go beyond \*newcomer" themes to those that the teacher or textbook writers believe are not only important for practical use but also exploitable for teaching purposes. The selected vocabulary relates to such social or global issues as world peace, the environment, worid communication and technology, space exploration, AIDS, world health, and human rights.

A third communicative approach is the notional-functional syllabus (discussed in Chapter 14). This approach provides teachers and program development specialists with a list of the basic functions of language and the vocabulary related to different notions within functions. The major functions identified in van Ek (1975), listed here along with related vocabulary domains, are:

1. Exchanging factual information Vocabulary domains: identify, ask, report, say, think X, etc.   
2. Exchanging intellectual information Vocabulary domains: agree, disagree, know, remember, etc.   
3. Exchanging emotional attitudes Vocabulary domains: surprise, hope, disappointment, fear, worry, preference, gratitude, sympathy, want, desire, etc.   
4. Exchanging moral attitudes Vocabulary domains: apology, forgiveness, approval, disapproval, ap. preciation, regret, indifference, etc.   
5. Suasion Vocabulary domains: suggest, request, invite, instruct, advise, warn, offer or request assistance, etc.   
6. Socializing Vocabulary domains: greetings, leave-takings, holiday sayings, toasts, etc.

Notions are different from functions. The major notions identified for the threshold level in this approach are similar to the themes used in survival English courses. The threshold level as described by van Ek (1976) lists the following notions for inclusion in a basic curriculum: personal identification; house and home; trade, profession, occupation; free time, entertainment; travel; relations with other people; health and welfare; education; shopping; food and drink; serviccs; places; foreign languages; and weather. Thinking of the possible scripts involved in each of these notions will give you a good idea of the vocabulary needed for each. This list of functions and notions provided a basis for what is called threshold level language. The list gives materials development experts a framework for planning materials and lessons with appropriate vocabulary.

Communicative approaches have continued in the 1980s and 1990s with an increasing focus on authentic materials - materials prepared for native speakers of the language. In beginning language classes, where these materials may primarily supplemenr other course materials, they may include menus, labels, advertisements, various types of forms to be filled out, taped news broadcasts, or soap operas. In more advanced classes, content-based instruction has become important. In these classes, the subject matter of the language course is the subject content of another course. For example, English for Business Purposes may accompany regular business courses. In some cases, these courses are \*sheltered" in that only language learners take the content course. In other cases, students attend the content class with native speakers and then take an adjuncr language class that uses the content material as the basis of language instruction.

In authentic language approaches, the vocabulary materials ideally reflect the needs and interests of the students and their teachers. If the approach is "pure," neither the vocabulary nor the language structures are simplified or sequenced in any way. There is variation in contentbased programs in that some teachers believe that it is acceptable to adapt the content materials (adaptation usually resulting in simplification), whereas others argue that any form of adaptation means the materials are no longer authentic. Madsen and Bowen (1978) argue that adaptation is inevitable when materials are used in the classroom. Teachers constantly change materials to match the needs and interests of their students, just as they often simplify the vocabulary, provide numerous definitions, examples, paraphrases, and synonyms, and even do some improvised vocabulary teaching in the process.

With the growing use of computers in language instruction, the selection of vocabulary to be learned has been placed increasingly in the hands of the learner. Programs such as Hypercard or Toolbook allow teachers to prepare "hypertexts," which are texts linked to other texts, such as dictionaries, thesauruses, or pictures, within the computer. The journal CALICO is filled with articles that show how teachers can use such programs to encourage students to work with authentic language materials. The students using these programs decide when and where they need help with vocabulary. When a student clicks on a word or touches the key indicated in the program, a pop-up dictionary gives the meaning, or grammar or cultural information, or simple translation information related to the word. With computer access to the dictionary, a thesaurus, or large database, the student can search for meanings with ease. Collocational information can also be provided, as in the COBUILD language course and the BBI Combinatory Dictionary computer programs.

In a more traditional vein, many publishing companies have continued to produce readers (usually called guided or structured readers) for language learners. Generally, the publishers use very controlled vocabulary or specifications for ways in which materials should be adapted for learners. The Heinemann Guided Readers Handbook (Milne, 1977), for example, suggests that beginner-level texts have approximately 600 basic words (that is, "not peculiar to the story and fully explained in the text, or illustrated or appearing in the Glossary"), elementary-level texts have 1,100, intermediate-level texts have 1,600, and upper-level texts have 2,200. The basic vocabulary is not given in any particular word list or because of any particular frequency count. The handbook also suggests that writers of the guided readers use "an intuitive, commonsense attitude to the control of vocabulary" (p. 16). Also, the writers are advised to use "the occasional unfamiliar word," especially if they structure the readers so that the meaning of such words is made clear by a "well-chosen illustration" or a gloss of the word in the context of the story -- "that is [they] have used the word in a situation where it is possible for the student to make an intelligent guess at its meaning" (p. 16). The guidelines explain that at beginner and elementary levels, authors have had to use more illustrations since they found that \*the language needed to gloss the word in a Glossary was more difficult than the language used in the text itself."

William Collins and Sons (1979) used a slightly different approach to vocabulary adjustments in its guided readers. Collins' six levels of readers have 300, 600, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, and 2,500 headwords (with singular/ plural and regular verb tense variants counted together as one), respectively. Their instructions include eight guidelines for deciding what these headwords would be:

1. frequency (based on a comparison of nine frequency counts)   
2. range (with "terms that denote classes of objects" being more used "than terms that denote members of that class" producing hierarchies such as "food [1], meat [2], lamb [4], roast lamb [5]")   
3. communicative need   
4. lexical sets (\*words that commonly go together are included together" such as knife, fork, and spoon)   
5. known words (international terms borrowed from English or other languages and basic classroom items)   
6. new words (such as astronaut or hijack)   
7. style ("Words like dawn, dusk, blaze and blossom are included because they are simple, concrete, expressive and pleasing.")   
8. idiom ("a group of words whose complete .. . meaning cannot be deduced from the sum of its parts. Examples: by the way, get up, inside out.")

Other publishers have similar guidelines that they give to authors of guided readers. Because the rationale behind specific criteria is not always stated, Bunker (1988) decided to test several guidelines to see which adjustments actually made materials easier for learners.

Bunker examined seven sets of writing guidelines used by publishers or by organizations preparing materials for nonnative speakers, particularly nonnative speakers who were also newly literate. All of the guideline sets advocated some kind of vocabulary control or adjustments. Six vocabulary guidelines seemed to be almost universally advocated. Bunker divided them into two major classes of adjustments: selection and control. The four general selection guidelines called for use of short terms, use of common or familiar terms, consistent use of tbe same word for the same concept, and use of precise terms (specialized terms) relevant to the topic. The two general control guidelines called for a number of word repetitions for new words and for contextual definitions of terms.

Bunker then found authentic materials on health, social, and economic issues that had been adjusted on-site for newly literate and low-level English learners. The materials preparers had not followed specific guidelines, but had simply made adjustments until they were sure that the users of the materials could understand them. Bunker had a group of very lowlevel ESL learners in the United States read and rate the difficuity of the materials and then she correlated those ratings with vocabulary charac

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

teristics of the texts. Bunker found no significant correlation between word length (both as measured in number of letters in the words and number of syllables) and text difficulty. However, she did find a definite negative correlation between reading difficulty and the percent of words that appeared within the 500, 750, and 1,000 most frequent words in the Brown University corpus (Francis & Kucera, 1982). In other words, the more words in the materials which were among these most common and frequent words, the easier the reading materials.

Next, token/type ratios (the number of total words divided by the number of unique words) were calculated for the materials and the ranking of these ratios was compared with the difficulty ranking to determine if consistent vocabulary made a difference. Bunker found a very high correlation (.83), suggesting that consistency makes a difference. In a second study of consistency, she checked a random sample of 10 percent of the words from each document (set of materials) to see how each content word was used. She then used a thesaurus to find synonyms for these content words and rechecked the documents to see how many of these synonyms appeared in the documents. There was no significant correlation between the average number of synonyms per word used and the difficulty of the text.

The proportion of technical words to total words correlated positively with the difficulty ranking, suggesting that more technical rerms make materials more difficult. The correlation between the percentage of technical words defined in the context (either by a direct definition or a clearly identifiable example) and the difficulty ranking was also significant, but in this case the correlation was negative. In other words, the more technical terms that were defined, the easier the materials were to read.

When Bunker looked at the effect of word repetition, she found that the easiest text repeated about 33 percent of its words more than five times, tbe second easiest had about 20 percent of its words repeated at least five times, the third easiest a little more than 14 percent, the fourth easiest about 19 percent, the fifth easiest a little more than 14 percent, and the most difficult a little less than 14 percent repeated five times. The correlation between these figures and the difficulty ranking was -.80, suggesting that the higher the percent of terms repeated more than five times (a number suggested by several sets of guidelines), the easier the texts were to read.

Overall, Bunker found that the following lexical characteristics contributed to the ease with which materials could be understood.

1. Use of common and familiar words.   
2. Consistency in use of terms.   
3. More than five repetitions of words.   
4. Definitions of words in context.

The following vocabulary adjustinents did not seem to contribute to understanding:

1. Use of short words.   
2. Use of fewer synonyms.   
3. Repetitions of words fewer than five times.

Even though these vocabulary adjustments made materials easier to un derstand, there is no proof that they make vocabulary easier to learr

In addition to general textbooks and readers, there are several other kinds of books for oral and aural practice that have specific kinds of vocabulary information. For example, Tillitt and Bruder's Speaking Naturally and Jones and von Baeyer's Functions of American English: Communication Activities for the Classroom offer practice activities to help students learn the vocahulary of speech acts (how to complain, how to apologize, how to ask for information, and so forth). The Fragiadakis All Clear? series (with cassettes and computer software) gives students practice with conversational interactions on a variety of scripts (ordering fast food, leaving messages on answering machines, and so forth). Such materials give students additional practice working with script vocabulary and especially with lexical phrases. Schecter's Listening Tasks is designed to teach listening and focuses on listening to telephone exchanges, natural conversations, and short public address announcements. The use of materials of this sort would give students more awareness of the vocabulary of communication signals.

Unlike general textbooks, readers, and textbooks such as those just discussed, which have many language teaching purposes in addition to vocabulary development, some textbooks are designed specifically to teach vocabulary. The rationale for what vocabulary is taught in these textbooks sometimes but not always follows the rationale for vocabulary selection in general texts. A vocabulary text that might follow word frequency guidelines is the Advanced English Vocabulary series by Barnard. The words in the course are based on several frequency lists includ. ing West's General Service list and counts made "of non-technical vocabulary in university science and social science textbooks" used in Hyderabad, India, and Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand.

Other familiar approaches used by vocabulary textbook writers for selecting vocabulary to teach are focus on situations, domains, or scripts in which the words might be used. For example, Seal's American VocabuIary Builder volumes have chapters on such topics as housework, sports, party time, money, and space. The Janus Survival Vocabulary Series has

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

separate books with such titles as Banking Language, Clothing Language, Credit Language, Medical Language, and Restaurant Language. Burgmeier, Eldred, and Zimmerman's Lexis: Academic Vocabulary Study, focuses on vocabulary in history, biology, business, and psychology, among others.

Other vocabulary texts, such as Trump, Trechter, and Holisky's Walk, Amble, Stroll, examine words used in particular domains such as the "walk" domain or the "happy-sad" domain, while still others, such as The Words You Need and More Words You Need by Rudzka, Channell, Putseys, and Ostyn use a semantic field approach to words much like that discussed in Chapter 2. Key words that appear in the news articles or readings used as context are listed in "grids" with similar words. Thus, words such as reach, accomplish, achieve, attain, and gain are examined in one grid in a chapter about the human animal and how it compares to other animals, and words like secret, clandestine, secretive, furtive, stealthy, underhand, underhanded are examined in a section of another chapter dealing with hidden romantic relationships.

Other vocabulary textbooks select items to teach in ways not usually followed in more general textbooks. For example, numerous ESL vocabulary textbooks (e.g., Dixson, Essential Idioms in English; Feare, Practice with Idioms; McCallum, Idiom Drills; Reeves, Idioms in Action; Genzel, Getting the Hang of Idioms and Expressions; Adams and Kuder, Attitudes through Idioms; McPartland, Take It Easy: American Idioms; Collis, Colloguial English) treat idioms and phrasal verbs. It is possible that these vocabulary items are selected because of difficulty. They are often not syntactically full formed (e.g., We say, "She hit the ceiling," or "She'll hit the ceiling," but not generally "She is hitting the ceiling"), so the points where there are exceptions to rules need to be learned. Many of them are also frozen, witb little allowance for variation (e.g., We say, "He's in over his head," but not "He's in over his hair" or "over his nose," or \*over his mouth"), so the words making up the idiom have to be learned precisely. However, the main reason so many books choose to treat these vocabulary items is probably not just their difficulty, but also because students find them so interesting and pervasive. Tbey are highly figurative and analogical and they share characteristics with other kinds of word play, so they become fun. Furthermore, they are everywhere, so language students find them vital for understanding.

Other vocabulary textbooks (e.g., Yorkey, Checklists for Vocabulary Study; Keen, Developing Vocabulary Skills; Sheeler and Markley, Words Words Words: A Guide to Formation and Usage; Hymanson, Connections and Contexts) seem to select vocabulary on the basis of word parts or morphemes (roots, suffixes, and affixes). These books seem to help students learn particular words and strategies for figuring out the meanings of other words as well.

# Practice 16.3

1. Review a genera! textbook for the language you teach. On what basis has the vocabulary been chosen? If the choice is based on frequency, what frequency list was used? If it is based on scripts, which scripts were chosen and why? If the organization is theme-based, what themes were selected? If it is a communicative approach that emphasizes the notional-functional approach, do the textbook writers explain which functions were selected and how the vocabulary is linked to functions? If the materials are based on authentic language materials, have the writers adapted the original? To what extent?

2. If you can obtain textbooks from different eras or espousing different approaches to teaching (e.g., audiolingual, Survival or Contextual English, notional-functional), look at how vocabulary is handted. How was vocabulary selected for inclusion or focus? what categories of vocabulary are included? What, if any, kinds of vocabulary exercises are in the book? Are there any similarities about the way vocabulary is handied regardless of approach? which approaches seem most different in their handling of vocabulary? What approach does your current textbook seem to use?

3. Teachers in content-based courses spend a great deal of time planning ways to teach vocabulary within authentic contexts (for examples, see Brinton, Srow, & Wesche, 1989). They may use the texts to teach ways of defining, the uses of synonyms and antonyms in context, and the ways that lexical cohesion works. To investigate lexical cohesion in the following paragraph, underline the words that relate to the notion of perception or vision. In which cases is equivalence of meaning clear? what other problems do you see in using this piece of authentic text with second language readers?

It is as though we -- or the people of any other society - grow up perceiving the world through glasses with distorting lenses. The things, events, and relationships we assume to be "out there" are in fact filtered through this perceptual screen. The first reaction, inevitably, on encountering people who wear a different kind of glasses is to dismiss their behavior as strange or wrong. To view other peoples' ways of tife in terms of our own cultural glasses is called ethnocentrism.

(Source: Brinton, Snow, and Wesche, 1989, p. 172)

What is ethnocentrism? Can you supply an antonym for this word? Do you think that learners would be able to detine the term after reading the paragraph? If possible, ask three international students to read the paragraph and give a definition for this term.

4. It's unlikely that you would supply perceptual screen as a synonym for distorting lenses. Are balloting and voting Synonyms? what about assertions and statements? Cohen et al. (1988) found that students in their case studies were not always sure about synonyms and paraphrases in the texts they read. And they sometimes thought that terms were synonymous when they were not. For example, one reader thought repair mode, repair processes, and repair scheme might refer to the same thing since they all start with the same word. Select a passage that contains synonyms and paraphrases. How close are the synonyms in meaning? How adequate are the paraphrases? Then ask an international student to read a passage and respond to your questions about the selected words. Does the use of either synonyms or paraphrases create a problem for the student?

5. See if you can replicate Bunker's study with materials that you are using. Select five to seven texts and have your students read them and rank them for difficulty. Then try doing some of the tests that Bunker did. What kinds of vocabulary tools (frequency lists, thesauruses, etc.) do you need to carry out this study? Do you have access to such tools in the language you are teaching? How would you test which vocabulary adjustments relate to vocabulary learning and not just understanding?

6. Choose a text in your target language that you would like to use with your !earners but tind too difficult for them. Try to make the adjustments in the text according to the four guidelines that Bunker found to be helpful. Use your adapted materials with a group of your learners. Do they find them any easier? Which of the adjustments do you find to be the hardest to make? Why?

7. Bunker (1988) found that having more than tive repetitions ot a word made materials easier for EsL learners, whereas Brown (1993) found no correlation between the number of times a word was used in a specific context and the learning of the word. How would you explain this contradiction?

8. If possible, find a textbook specifically designed to teach vocabulary that you would consider using. Without reading the preface, forward, or notes to the teacher, look at the chapters or lessons and see if you can tell how words were selected for inclusion in the text. Does the reason for choosing the vocabulary match the reasons for including vocabulary in the more general textbook you might use? What advantages and disadvantages do you see to matching and not matching? Do the advantages and disadvantages you see match those of your classmates or colleagues?

# Planned vocabulary teaching

We have considered the types of vocabulary adjustments that are used to make language accessible to learners. We noted that the language addressed to learners, whether by teachers or other native speakers of the language, is unconsciously adjusted to the level they believe is appropriate for the learner. They do this adjusting in order to make their messages understood and to allow the discourse interaction to continue with as few breakdowns as possible. The aim is not that of teaching the learner. Learning, therefore, is incidental. In this section we will discuss issues that relate to intentional vocabulary instruction.

There are numerous types of approaches, techniques, exercises, and practice that can be uscd to teach vocabulary. The dilemma teachers often face is in deciding which among these numerous rypes would be best for their students and their circumstances. We have found several principles that can inform such decisions.

One principle that we have found useful in all methodological decisions is the principle of time-effectiveness. How much preparation time does the method require of the teacher? How much time does it require of the Hearner? Does the benefit received match the time spent?

Another principle for judging methods is that of content. When the learners are finished using the method, what do they have in the way of content? Will the method help learners acquire the words they want or need? Furthermore, what aspects of words will be known or enhanced as a result of using the method? Will learners see the features, the fields, the core meanings, the prototype structures, or the relations of the words because of the method? Will they be sensitive to the words' potential as figurative language or aware of their differences across cultures? Will they know what scripts, communication signals, or speech acts the words are used in? Will they recognize and use the morphological features of the word correctly? Will they understand any register restrictions the words may have and, thus, be able to use them in appropriate ways and contexts? Some activities will give greater knowledge in some of these areas and some will give greater knowledge in others.

Another way to look at content is to judge what steps in the vocabulary acquisition process - encountering new words, getting the word forms, getting the word meanings, consolidating word form and meaning in memory, or using the words - the method might contribute to. What additional instruction would be necessary in order to have all of the acquisition steps covered and the words fully learned?

Furthermore, methods can be judged by what additional value or learning they bring to the learners: Will the learners just know a limited number of new words or will they also know how to learn words better? Will they have transferrable strategies and techniques for learning that can be used with other vocabulary? Maybe even more important, will they want to continue learning words?

Following are evaluations of the merits of two rather general approaches to vocabulary techniques or exercises, chosen because one is considered a traditional method and the second is considered a more recent development. The evaluations are carried out using the principles just listed as evaluation guidelines.

The first approach to be discussed, which seems decidedly productfocused, and also closely connected to the first step of vocabulary learning (encountering new words), is that of using word lists. The basic technique is to give students a list of words to be learned. Such lists have not been as strong a component of communicative language approaches as they were of audiolingual and grammar translation methods. Yet, Huff (1992) found vocabulary lists in all of the current university foreign language texts (seven in Spanish and ten in German) he examined.

The time-effectiveness of the word list method can be enhanced depending on how we handle several variables. For example, what learners will have in the way of content depends on what words we include in the lists. Lists taken directly from a book may or may not be what learners want or need depending on the topics the book treats. A more likely way to get word lists that match learners' desires and needs is to have the learners make their own lists from materials they use. Students will learn the vocabulary of fields that interest them. For children, this may mean finding picture books with all sorts of vehicles, or buildings, or foods. If students are interested in some particular field of study, there are English for specific purposes materials on business, banking, tourism, hotel management, and a variety of other topics, each with its own specialized vocabulary. Although students may be motivated to seek out the vocabulary that is needed in their areas of interest, the teacher can facilitate selfstudy by making such materials available. In Chapter 15, we noted that students thought television and radio broadcasts were an excellent way to encounter new vocabulary. You may want to encourage acquisition of such materials for your school and encourage students to make their word lists as they use the materials. The ABC News ESL Video Library is a series of authentic broadcast materials on timely topics that may be appropriate. Lee (1994) found that video clips of TV commercials proved very helpful in teaching Chinese vocabulary (and other language aspects) to native English speakers. All materials would need to be previewed to be sure they are appropriate for your students. Another possibility would be to use ideas and techniques like those offered by Dornyei and Thurrell (1992) that will help students to first discover and then practice the lexical phrases needed for successful speech act performance. Working with such materials, students have opportunities not only to list, learn, and use appropriate words and lexical phrases, but also to develop an awareness of and sensitivity to the vocabulary of particular speech acts.

Ashton- Warner's book on teaching among the Maoris, Teacher (1963), shows clearly how letting students choose their own words to learn enhances learning. Ashton-Warner tells of using this technique with the children who were learning to read. Each day she encouraged them to bring words that they wanted to learn. She found that the learners came to have a genuine eagerness to learn the new words and that their motivation level was much higher with this technique than with any other she had previously tried.

If computers are available, you can try a more modern version of the word list method. Classes or individuals can build their own word lists or even complete dictionaries using do-it-yourself computer programs. Entries placed in these lists or dictionaries can then be programmed into a variety of computer word games or multiple-choice activities (Choicemaster is a good program for this latter work). Using the program, students can monitor their work and you can keep track of their progress.

Word lists by themselves are not particularly good for helping learners learn other content features of words such as semantic networks or fields, figurative potential, or morphology. If all of the words on the word lists are given in context, however, there are possibilities that learners will get some of the other information. Contexts larger than single sentences are usually more helpful. Having words in such contexts can also help learners increase their abilities to use the process of guessing meanings from context cues.

Huff (1992) also found that manipulating the arrangement of words in a word list could enhance the learning of some features. In his study, he compared the word learning of students who used a list of Russian words in random order to that of students who used a list containing the same words presented in order by part of speech. He found that the second group (those who received the words listed by part of speech) were able to internalize that information along with the meaning of the words.

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

Sometimes native language translations (a bilingual gloss) or second language synonyms for the words are provided with word lists. When word lists are coupled with glosses, either L1 or L2 glosses, or when learners are encouraged to use context to guess meanings, another step in vocabulary learning - getting the word meaning - has already been taken for the learners. The kinds of activities teachers assign to be done with the word lists may bring in the other steps in the vocabulary acquisition process. In Suggestopedia, a language teaching method, where learners often deal with very long lists of new words, sometimes the lists are presented orally or by the teacher with varying types of pronunciation. For example, the teacher might repeat the words several times varying vocal qualities such as volume (whispers and shouts), pitch (very high and very low), intonation (altering ups and downs), and speed (very fast and very slow). The results have a tendency to stick in memory so that learners remember the word form. Suggestopedia techniques also call for the use of background music, which relieves anxiety and enhances memory. The use of such techniques with the word list helps teach a technique or strategy that learners can use with subsequent vocabulary.

If learners are required to match words with their meanings given in auother list (not in the same order as the word list), the activity helps consolidate word forms with word meanings, another essential vocabulary learning step. In a common variation on this technique, a word from the word list is on one card and its meaning is on another. Students then find matches in some kind of game, like Concentration, where all cards are placed face down in random order and then students take turns turning over two cards trying to match word and meaning. If no match is found, the two cards are put in their regular places face down again and the next person turns over two cards. These kinds of activities, of course, help students see other strategies that they might use in trying to learn words they may encounter later.

Activities can be added which also take students through the final step of vocabulary acquisition - using the word. Written activities can be as simple as asking students to write a sentence for each word studied. Sugawara (1993) found that having students answer questions that necessitate use of the word in the answer also helped students learn words and feel confident in their use. Such questions might be based on information found in natural databases. Levy (1990) gives us a description of English language databases of differing sizes (the Brown corpus, the Survey of the English Language, the Lancaster-Oslo-Bergen corpus, the Australian Corpus Project, COBUILD) and those developed for specific-purpose vocabulary (e.g., English for Business Courses, Corpus of Academic Texts). Students can use concordances to search these databases for information about word use. Concordance programs are becoming more and more readily available (most college campus computer centers have at least WordCruncher and MicroConcord). More and more databases are also being released on other languages (for a description of a French database, see Morrissey, 1993). Furthermore, student roleplaying and responding to oral questions using words from the word list are good ways of encouraging oral use and ensuring a more complete knowledge Of the words.

A traditional vocabulary learning method (word list learning, in this case) thus may or may not be time-effective, depending on what activities and techniques are included as part of the method. Particular activities and techniques can enhance motivation, interest, word usefulness, knowledge of word features and functions, and acquisition of vocabulary learning strategies. In short, the overall choice of approach may be less significant in what is learned or how fast it is learned as are the many small choices of details within the overall approach.

The second method we will evaluate using our guideline principles is something generally considered a more modern way of teaching vocabulary: semantic domains. With this method, words in the same semantic field, such as words for cooking, or loving, or walking, and so forth, are taught together. Most of the instruction with the domains approach consists of giving information about the differences between words. For example, in Walk, Amble, Stroll: Vocabulary Building Through Domains Level 2 (Trump, Trechter, & Holisky, 1992) the following information can be found for the BUILD domain:

Verbs like establish, found, set $\pmb { \nu } \pmb { \nu }$ , and organize are used to describe the first Step in starting a new company, an organization, or even a country.

Some words in this domain give the idea of people working on a building, a bridge, or some other physica! structure. Some verbs like this are: build, construct, erect, and put up.

The verbs make, produce, and manufacture are general words that describe the whole process of making a new thing.

(pp. 48--49)

Exercises following the instructions in this book require learners to substitute one word from the appropriate domain for another, for example, construct for build, or to choose between two possible words to fill a blank in a given sentence, e.g., "Paper was first. in China" (manufactured, constructed). Then students may answer questions on the founding of their own country and about a reading about Thomas Edison. After these exercises have been completed, students are introduced to related forms for the concepts: nouns where words have been introduced as verbs, or verbs where words have been introduced as nouns. The exercises following have students recognize and/or use the new forms Introduced.

Although not all domain approaches are as thorough as the one in

# Vocabulary, semantics, and language education

Walk, Amble, Stroll, it raises the issue of the cost-effectiveness of such exercises. With regard to content, once again the domains' usefulness to students and their desires to learn the words depends entirely upon their individual experiences. Although students could produce their own domain lists, this could take considerable time if done thoroughly. However, it is possible to compromise between handing students a list of words in a domain and expecting them to come up with the words on their own by giving students paragraphs or longer segments of discourse on a single topic. If the passages use several words from the same domain in order to avoid repetition of terms, students could be taught to look for such related words and to make their own small domain lists which could be expanded through dictionary or thesaurus work.

This method can be used to address other aspects of content although they are not necessarily part of it. For example, you and your students can identify core meanings or prototypes within the domain, or potential scripts, registers, and contexts where the different words might be used. These elements often appear naturally as part of the information given in the instructions differentiating words within the domain. Notice, for example, how the instructions given above for the BUILD domain suggest spheres (such as an organization, company, or country) when a particular word might be used.

As with the word list approach some necessary vocabulary acquisition steps are naturally included with the domain approach, and others may require conscious inclusion through accompanying activities. For instance, the domain method automatically provides for encountering specific words listed in the chosen domain, the first step to acquisition. As with word lists, there is little natural focus on the acquisition of form, although, as above, this could be improved with the addition of Suggestopedia techniques. The third step, getting the meaning of the word, is handled explicitly in the domain method with the myriad of instructions for differentiating one word from another. In fact, the information given in this regard appears to be precisely the kind of information which learners need in order to differentiate between words that are similar in meaning, a common problem for more advanced learners (see Table 15.2 in Chapter 15).

Just as with word lists, there are no specific ways for consolidating word form and meaning in memory in the domain approach, although many of the possible exercises for the word list approach could serve this purpose with the domain approach. Flashcards and matching games are also possible in this approach although they are more difficult because differences between words are smaller within a particular domain.

Using words, the final necessary acquisition step, comes naturally in the domain approach. If contexts are given in which different words appear, it is natural to ask written or oral questions about the subject matter of the context, leading to natural use of the words to be learned. Roleplaying also provides opportunities for learners to use new words orally.

As with the word list method, the domain method should help students to pick up vocabulary learning strategies that can be used in other situations. Making a domain list is a strategy that could help students in the future. The habit of searching a semantic field for related terms develops a strategy they can continue to use. Getting used to making fine distinctions in meaning can also prepare students to use thesauruses and even dictionaries better. Processes that will help students learn better in the future may also be taught, whether intentional or not, in the activities and exercises related to working with domains.

Each of these two distinct methods neither motivates nor demotivates learners necessarily. Rather, motivation depends on many accompanying activities and intangible qualities, including teacher enthusiasm and prep. aration and individual student enjoyment of the activities. As mentioned previously, the choice of words also makes a difference, and teachers can facilitate these choices and activities by seeing that appropriate materials are available.

All of this may sound almost impossible if you are just setting up a program or if you teach languages other than English. Fortunately, there are many new materials on the market for a variety of languages. Check current publishers' catalogs for these and subscribe to the Athelstan Newsletter on Technology and Language Learning (2476 Bolsover, Suite 464, Houston, Texas 77005; e-mail: barlow@ruf.rice.edu). The group that puts out this publication tests and evaluates a wide variety of computer-assisted instruction programs for most languages taught in colleges and universities. Their survey of software includes programs for English, Spanish, French, Japanese, Arabic, Italian, German, Russian, and Chinese. The publication also has a "concordancing corner," CDROM news, resources (including computer clearing house information), and ads for new products.

If your school does not have the variety of materials nor the funding needed to support your instructional program, you can still begin to build your own small collection. In many countries, young people are required to do public service as a way of paying for their own education. Such aides can help find and organize materials for a learning center even if it has to be in one corner of your classroom. In visits to language classrooms in very poor schools, vocabulary posters and posters of lexical phrases organized around greetings, invitations, and other speech acts are prepared by the students themselves and proudly posted in the hallways. Not only do these decorate sometimes unattractive buildings, bur they also reinforce the vocabulary the students have learned. Each time students pass by, they may point out the words they contributed and study those contributed by their classmates. The effectiveness of such materials and activities may be very high with little time or money spent.

The key in all vocabulary teaching is to keep motivation high while encouraging students to develop strategies that they can continue to use once they leave the classroom. The effectiveness of these strategies for individual teachers and learners depends on many factors, and language educators must approach decisions about methods and materials systematically, using principles to help us make wise decisions.

# Practice 16.4

1. Select fifty words that you would like your students to learn in a second language. Now list ten different methods that you have seen used by teachers or in textbooks for teaching vocabulary. Make a chart in which you can show which methods you think are most effective for each of the fifty words. Which words would be hard (or easy) to learn by any method? which method do you perceive to be the most usetul for the words you nave chosen? Which method do you perceive to be the least useful? Can you isolate what characteristios cause a rnethod to be more or less eftective? Try various methods with your learners and assess their effectiveness.

2. If you encounter unknown words in a language you are studying, do you stop and look them up, guess from the context, or continue reading with the hope that the meaning will become ciear? Would it help if the teacher pre. sented words before you began a reading? What kinds of clues night a teacher give about meaning that would nelp you understand the text?

3. Krantz (1991) investigated three questions about learning vocabulary in a foreign language: (a) Does vocabulary learning take place in reading words in context? (b) Does vocabulary learning take place by both reading words and looking them up in a dictionary? (c) Which is more efficient, a bilingual or monolingual dictionary? How might you replicate this study but also test the effect of explicit vocabulary teaching as well? What other questions would you like to ask about the effectiveness of teacher techniques (rather than the effectiveness of particular teaching materials)?

4. What other methods and techniques, in addition to the ones listed here, have you used? with students you teach. try out some of these methods and others previously

discussed in this book. Assess the amount of time it takes tor you to prepare to use the method, how much time it takes for the students to use the method as designed, how well you feel your students have learned the words they were trying to use, what aspects of the words the students seem to have learned, what vocabulary learning strategies the students have learned, and how they seem to enjoy the method. What factors are most important in your deciding what methods to use?

5. Make a list of vocabulary learning strategies that have been discussed in this chapter that you can teach your students. Are there any strategies that may not work with the language you are teaching? With your classmates or tellow teachers, devise plans tor how to present the strategies. What kinds of tests would you use to see if your teaching makes a difference? Test the effectiveness of your plans.

# Research and application

1. Huff (1992) examined where and how vocabulary was presented in seven widely used university Spanish textbooks and in ten prominent university German textbooks. All of them had vocabulary lists, but the point in the chapter in which they were presented had changed over the years. Three of the texts Huff looked at (and only one written after l970) had the vocabulary at the front of the chapter like older grammar-translation-type textbooks. In five the vocabulary was only in the middle of the cliapter; in five others it was ouly at the end of the chapter; and in four it was both in the middle and at the end of the chapter. Most methodologists believe that it is better to "prime" vocabulary learning by presenting the words to be learned in a lesson first, asking students if they have encountered the words before, asking for their guesses on definitions, and asking for words they think might be related. This prepares students to encounter the words in the lesson and check the accuracy of their guesses. How might you test the effectiveness of vocabulary placement and the use of planned preliminary activities vs. planned vocabulary teaching following lessons?

2. When Gipe (1979) looked at four different methods of vocabulary instruction with children, sle found that a treatment consisting of definitions and instructional sentence contexts was better than one where the children just studied the words with their definitions. Both of these treatments were better than one in which unfamiliar words and familiar words similar to them in meaning were paired on one list and mixed on another list, and students were asked to categorize the words. The definitions and instructional sentence contexts were also better than a treatment in which the children looked up the words, wrote the definitions they found, and then composed original sentences using the words. Levin, McCormick, Miller, Berry, and Pressley (1982) did a similar study and found no significant advantage for the instructional context sentence group over a group who studied words and their definitions for an equivalent amount of time. Examine the methods of both studies. Whose findings do you find the most convincing? How would you go about doing a similar study with methods for teaching second language vocabulary?

3. Jenkins and Dixon (1983) criticized Gipe's (1979) study on methods of teaching word meanings because she did not control for time. Rank the methods you listed in Practice 16.4.1 according to the amount of time each would take to learn one word. Why would it be important to think about the amount of time each would take? How would you design a study to test timeeffectiveness of different methods? If you can, carry out your study with students and see what conclusions you can draw.

4. Jenkins, Matlock, and Slocum (1989) looked at two approaches to vocabulary instruction - teaching individual word meanings and teaching how to derive word meaning from context. Not surprisingly, these researchers found that the first method resulted in students' having knowledge of specific words and that the second method taught students how to use contextual clues. What general principles about research can be discovered from these findings? Do learners always do better the thing that they practice doing? How would you test these ideas?

5. Beck and colleagues (Beck, McCaslin, & McKeown, 1980; Beck, Perfetti, & McKeown, 1982) combined several vocabulary instruction practices including "defining tasks, sentence generation tasks, classification tasks, oral production taske, game-hke tasks completed under timed conditions, and tasks that take advantage of the semantic or affective relationship among target words and previously acquired vocabulary" (1980, p. 13). The 104 target words were grouped into semantic categories consisting of eight to ten words (e.g., people - accomplice, rival, virtuoso; eyes -- gape, spectator, binoculars) and each category was taught for 30 minutes a day over a period of five days. A subset of words from each semantic category was reviewed two or three days after the words had been taught to see if greater familiarity with the words would produce greater "automaticity'" of recognition under timed conditions.

Beck et al. found that students receiving the combined activities treatment performed better than students receiving no special vocabulary treatment. They also found that the reviewed words were recalled better than the nonreviewed words and that students performed faster for the reviewed words on a sentence verification test than they did for the nonreviewed words. What was surprising was that the students who had received the combined-activities treatment did better than the no-treatment group on a vocabulary test that contained words that had not been studied in the treatment. Beck and her colleagues speculated that the explicit instruction on vocabulary may have made the students more word conscious and, thus, have had a more important effect than the simple learning of the words studied over a five-month period. Read the study and see what was discovered in terms of product and process. Devise a similar study, looking at both product and process results.

6. Although the domain method of instruction is fairly new in second language learning, it has been tried for other verbal learning tasks. Higa (1963) found learning interference when words on lists to be learned were too related. He found that learning of such related words was slower than learning of completely unrelated words. Tinkham (1993) found that students had more difficulty learning new words when they were presented in semantically related groups than when they were presented in unrelated groups. It is unclear if Higa and Tinkham looked at whether the words in the two groups (related and unrelated) were learned to the same depth of knowledge. The unrelated words were never presented or tested in any way that requires making distinctions among closely related terms. How would you design a study to test how initial presentation in related groups or unrelated groups affects the eventual ability to differentiate both unrelated and related terms and the time to reach that attainment?

# Conclusion

In this book we have looked at a variety of ways in which linguists, psychologists, anthropologists, cognitive scientists, and teachers describe the systems that are included in vocabulary, semantics, and language education. The goal of discovering system is one that is shared by most fields of inquiry. Fach of the methods gives us one way of thinking about how words and meanings are related and how they are used in our everyday activities.

Whenever we search for system, we immediately find variation. We have demonstrated the types of variations that exist in the ways that speakers of different languages use words to convey meanings. While there certainly are underlying primitive or universal meanings, the ways these are expressed differ across language and culture groups. Vocabulary selection varies across dialects and across the full range of sociolinguistic variables, which are constantly shifting as we play out our parts in interactions with each othcr. These variations arc as important, and as interesting, as the basic systens that underlie them.

Glance at each of the objectives listed in the introduction to see how well you have met the goals we set for you. If you selected other objectives, check to be sure that you have met them as well. We hope we have given you sufficient practice to connect the objectives of this course and the related information in the text to practical application of that information to the kinds of everyday issues learners and teacher confront in their classrooms.

We also hope that this introduction to yocabulary, semantic, lexical, and morphology systems witl serve as a guide for your teaching, materials development, research, and testing projects. An introduction, however, is only that. We urge you to continue your study of this field of language research, and to feel free to contribute to the field by sharing your ideas, your data, and the outcome of your teaching and research projects. From your work will come better descriptions of the invisible semantic and lexical systems of language. You can also contribute by applying what you have learned to our understanding of how we learn and use these systems in other languages and in cross-cultura! communication not discussed here.
