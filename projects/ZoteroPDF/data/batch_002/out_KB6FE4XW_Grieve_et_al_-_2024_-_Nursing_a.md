Handling Editor: Dr Hilary Nesi

This paper focuses on tertiary English as an additional language (EAL) students' ethical choices, and the factors impacting on them, when deciding whether to engage with artificially-intelligent (AI) machine translation (MT) tools for the writing of university assignments. It also investigates how student responses align with either deficit-oriented or translanguaging theoretical perspectives. Via semi-structured interviews, the voices of 23 EAL nursing and midwifery students indicate an array of ethical positions which are based on three key areas of consideration: 1) ownership of language and ideas; 2) fairness and respect; and 3) personal growth. The study highlights the scalar, strategic and dynamic nature of students' ethical decisions and shows that questions of ethicality tap into individual, social and institutional constructs of fairness and respect, skills recognition, lifelong learning and language dominion. The findings also indicate that discussions of fairness should focus not only on differences between non-EAL and EAL students, but also inequalities within EAL cohorts. Student responses provide evidence of both deficit-oriented and translanguaging perspectives. The researchers call for universities to create clear policies concerning use of MT that recognise the levels of reflection that students engage in when writing their assignments and value the full linguistic repertoires that students bring to global educational settings.

# 1. Introduction

This study investigates English as an additional language (EAL) students' ethical views on the acceptability of using artificilly intelligent (Al) machine translation tools (MT) for the writing of nursing and midwifery assignments in undergraduate and postgraduate nursing education at a large Australian university. It also explores the factors that impact on their decisions to use MT for writing assignments and the ways in which their responses can be interpreted as deficit-oriented or translanguaging approaches to assignment writing.

For the purpose of this research, MT is defined as technology that enables computergenerated translation of text or speech from one language to another and asgnment writing refe to any texs tht are required to be sumitte for summatieassessment as part of students' course requirements. Ethics is used as an umbrella term for moral principles and concerns, while academic integrity describes a narrower se of ethical isues conventionaly addresed in university policies and training, such as plagiarism and cheating.

This research is explicitly positioned as critical of the deficit-oriented treatment of EAL students (see Ryan, 2020; Tardy & Whitig 2017) and interpretation of the data aligns with translanguaging approaches which encourage students to draw on their fullinguistic repertoires (e.g., Garcia & Kleifgen, 2020; Paulsrud et al., 2017; Tai & Dai, 2023; Van Viegen & Zappa-Holman, 2020). As opposed to deficit-oriented aproaches that position multilingual students who use MT as outsourcing learning or undermining language acquisition, this study seeks to reveal a counter-discourse that highlights students use of MT as resources to communicate meaning (se Paterson, 2023), which aligns with translanguaging pedagogical practice. By highlighting the two opposing discourses the study provides a foundation to address the fact that the ethical use of MT and other newly available technologies remains insuficiently addressed by university policies.

The recently released interface ChatGPT has garnered substantial media attention due to concerns about AI-assisted cheatin e.g. Davis, 2023; Hsu, 2023). Although critiqued by some scholars (e.g. Anson, 2022), the widespread panic regarding AI as enabling academic misconduct highlights the importance of investigating the students ethical perceptions towards incorporating technology into their studies. This includes Al-based MT tools such as Google Translate which are already widely used (e.g. Dorst et al., 2022; Klimova et al., 2022). As discussed below, although research is beginning to explore interactions with MT as a productive translanguaging resource (Beiler & Dewilde, 2020; Chen et al., 2019; Heugh et al., 2022; Kelly & Hou, 2022; Tsai, 2022; Vogel et al, 2018; Zhou et al., 202), ittle i known about universt students ethical prcetions of using  for writing assments, ecially beyond language acqusition and translation studies (e.g. Alhaisoni & Alhaysony, 2017; Ata & Debreli, 2021; Jlly & Maimone, 2015; Liu et al., 2022).

In the context of uncertainties surrounding the appropriatenes of technologically assisted writing, scholars have clld for universities to implement clear policies and guidelines, particularly in relation to MT (g, Ata & Debreli, 2021; Dinneen, 2021; Groves & Mundt, 2021; Heugh et al., 2022; Jolley & Maimone, 2015; Paterson, 2023). This includes calls for MT literacy training for both students and academics (Bowker, 2020a, 2020b, 2021; Delorme Benites, 2021; Dorst et al., 2022; Loock & Lechauguette, 2021). A clearer understanding of al stakeholders' views on the use of MT to asst academic writing (including students, educators, and ad. ministrators) is a key step in developing such responses (Mundt & Groves, 2016). This study focuses on the perspectives and decision-making of students, whilethe views of other stakeholders will be explored in future research. Additionall, the paper argues that the routine linking of MT use with plagiarism in some instances (e.g. Dinneen, 2021) can be challenged by translanguaging perspectives, which, as iscussed under Translanguaging in higher education, considers MT not as a means of cheating but a resource allowing EAL students to acces all f their communicative resources, including their multilingual ompetencies and literacy skills Translanguaging approaches to post-secondary education therefore afford an \*asst-oriented lens to the plurilingual competencies learners possess rather than focusing on abilities learners are perceived to lack" (Van Viegen & Zappa-Hollman, 2020, p. 174.

# 1.1. Translanguaging in higher education

Translanguaging in both reearch and pedagogy entails a political orientation. It sees tochallenge the underlying ideologies which have long shaped language attitudes, policies, teaching, and leaning (Li, 2022), including defintions of named languages) (Otheguy et a., 2015), conceptualisations of ilingualism (Garcia & Li, 2014), and defict-oriented discourses concerning multilingual speakers in English as language of instruction environments (Lin, 2020). In the context of international tertiary education (Grie et l., 2022), translanguaging is a theory of language practice and cognition according to which all students, regardless of thir language backgrounds draw not on distinct linguistic codes (e.g. languages), but on a unified, integrated, and dynamic repertoire f communicative resources to make meaning (Beres, 2015; Garcia & Kleifgen, 2020; Garcia & Li, 2014; Garcia & Lin, 2017; Li, 2018; Vogel & Garcia, 2017). Translanguaging theory frames 'named languages' as ideologically-mediated social constructs and rejects the notion that language can be categorised into context-free and discrete linguistic systems (Otheguy et al., 2015).

Translanguaging policies and pedagogies seek to facilitate practices in which \*all students whole linguistic repertoire are invited included, recognised and accepted in the learning act (Paulsrud et a., 2017, p. 16). Individuals engage in translingual practices by, for example, incorporating elements associated with different so-called languages along with other ocal and semiotic resources, e.g. visual and embodied communication, interactions with artefacts and interlocutors (Canagarajah, 2012, 2013, 2018). Of particular interest for this study, though only reently gaining aention among rearchers (seTzirides, 2021), is the role of techology such as MT in allowing students to employ allof ther non-English language resource in their trtiary education, thus enabling and engaging in translanguaging pedagogy and practice.

According to recent studies that iscuss tanslanguaging assed by MT software (Beiler & Dewilde, 2020; Chen et al., 2019, Heugh et al., 2022; Kelly & Hou, 2022; Tsai, 2022; Vogel et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2022, a student's interactions with MT constitute an embodied resource whereby \*the product and proceses of the bilingual learner-machine translationassemblage are valid and valuable classroom biliteracy instances, and that used aropriatl, they can be seen as part of translanuaging (Vogel t al., 2018, p. 103). In line with Vogel et al. (2018), who emphasise the role of diverse linguistic and non-linguistic resources for communication, in this study MT is conceptualised as part of students' diverse repertoires for communicating, rather than merely auxiliary to them.

MT use has also been found to combine with other resources (e.g. other digital tools, interaction) to aid students' additional language writing (Beiler & Dewilde, 2020). As part of their translanguaging practices, leaners can apply a range of skill in their application of MT, including post-editing and criticlly evaluating MT output (Kelly & Hou, 2022; Zhou et l., 2022. These practices result not only in improved writing due to MT-aided revision (Chen et al., 2019; Tai, 2022), but also increased acces to, and sharing

of, knowledge (Heugh et al., 2022).

# 1.2. Student use of machine translation tools

The widespread availability of MT and other online language asstance tools (e.g. online dictionaries, and word processing software), mean that linguisticaly diverse EAL students can interact with a myriad of technologies when writing for academic purposes (Jeanjaroonsri, 2023; Moore t al., 2016). f these tools, use of MT in universty anguage studies contxts has thus far, received the most research attention (e.g., Briggs, 2018; Correa, 2014; Garcia & Pena, 2011).

Often alongside other digital tools (Jeanjaroonsri, 2023; Kennedy, 2021), MT (e.g. Google Translate, DeepL) is widely and frequently used in higher education (Briggs, 2018; Cliford et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2022; ino, 2020), potentially even if prohibited (Heugh et al., 2022; ONeill, 2019). Although isues with using MT, such as inaccurate output or over-reliance, are often noted e.g. Briggs, 2018; ONeil, 2019, Rangarittikun, 2022), student attitude ppear to be broady positive towards the technology (e.. Bahri & Mahadi, 2016; Delorme Benites et al., 2021). This is consistent with views of contemporary students as ap-centric' learners (Ashford, 2021) and translanguaging perspectives that interpret student interactions with artefacts in their spatial repertoires as a means of allowing them to aces iverse semiotic resources (Canagarajah, 2018; Pennycook, 2017; Pennycook & Otsuji, 2014).

# 1.3. Academic integrity and MT

Academic dishonesty is a recurrent theme in the research on MT in language education (see Jolley & Maimone, 2022), with some researchers framing its use as cheating (e.g. Corra, 2014; Harris, 2010; Steding, 2009) and others viewing it as a tool that can be productively incorporated into language learning (e.g. Jolly & Maimone, 2015; Knowles, 2022; Lee & Briggs, 2021). Ilstrating concerns regarding academic integrity, Mundt and Groves (2016) suggest that, regardlessof the focus of their studies, any student submitting MT-assisted work is committing an offence in the sense that the work they are submitting is their, but could not be truly said to be theirs in totality" (p. 395). Similarly, in the contex of Direct Entry English Programs, Dinneen (2021) positions MT (and paraphrasing tools) as problems for academic integrity, describing students' writing as \*the result of an algorithm" rather than their "own cognition' (p. 41). However, Prentice and Kinden (2018) consider use of MT to be "pr academic practice", but not necessrily plagiarism (p. 13), whereas use of online paraphrasing toos to spin uncited source material (i.e. disguising text from plagiarism detection tools through word substitution) is a clear instance of academic dishonesty.

Beyond academic misconduct, scholars have raised concerns about the use of MT in universities, such as negative impacts on the legitimacy of credentials and graduates' preparednes for the workforce (Groves & Mundt, 2021; Klekovkina & Denie-Higney, 2022) This highlights the importance of expanding discussions about student use of MT at university beyond academic integrity to address other ethical issues, including linguistic gatekeeping and student equity (see Paterson, 2022).

# 1.4. Student academic integrity perspectives

Limited research is avalable on university students' ethicality judgements towards MT and is primarily drawn from the use of MT in language acquisition and translation studies contexts (exceptions include de Vries & Groves, 2022; Dorst et al., 2022). Focusing on survey results from a cohort of 37 students studying Spanish at the University of Manchester, Nino (2020) found that $9 0 . 9 \%$ of the participants did not think MT is a plagiarism-inducing technology, although some students reported a preference for other language assistance tools, such as online dictionaries and verb conjugation tools. Comparatively, White and Heidrich (2013) found that some students reported feling that they were cheating when using MT for a German as aforeign language writing task, despite having permission to do so. Liu et al. (2022) found that few translation studies students in their study. $. 4 . 8 \%$ of undergraduates and $1 2 . 8 \%$ of post graduates) agreed that there are no ethical issues involved in the use of MT for assinments, while a majority thought that the extent of modification of MT output affects ethicality.

Language learner attitudes to MT have been found to be reliant on two key variables: length of translated segment and task type. Students perceive shorter translations of words or phrases to be more ethical than longer segments or full text lhaisoni & Alhaysony, 2017; Ata & Debreli, 2021; Jolley & Maimone, 2015). Regarding the type of task, more than half of the language learners in Ata and Debreli (2021) considered it ethical to use MT for reading $( 5 4 \% )$ writing $( 5 3 \% )$ , grammar $( 5 2 \% )$ , and presentation $( 5 6 \% )$ tasks. In Alhaisoni and Alhaysony (2017) more students considered it ethical to use MT in writing assignments than for presentations, work. book/lab, or translation assignments.

The situation in non-language-focused disciplinary study areas is less well documented and is predominantly based on question. naires (e.g. Dorst et al., 2022; Kim & LaBianca, 2018) rather than interview and other qualitative data (for an exception, see Heugh et al., 2022). The few existing studies demonstrate some similarity to the above findings in language acquisition and translation programs. In Kim and LaBianca (2018), a sample of EAL and non-EAL international students rated word/phrase level translations as more ethical than sentence/paragraph level translations. Similarly, de Vries and Groves (2022) report that EAL undergraduate and postgraduate international students consider writing words or short phrases with MT more appropriate than writing for longer seg. ments of text. The humanities students sampled in Dorst et al. (2022) likewise appeared to be sensitive to the size of translated segment, as well as the context of use.

Overall, available research suggests that researchers, language learners and students from non-language-focused disciplines have mixed and often contex-specific attitudes towards the ethicality of using MT for academic writing. Research also highlights that students use MT selectively rather than uncriticall and there is uncertainty as to whether translation of one's own writing can be

This study is motivated by key gaps in current understandings about international and/or EAL students' ethicality judgments towards using MT to write their assgnments. While exising literature suggests that students report varied and context-specific attudes towards the ethics of using MT in language acquisition and translation studies, perceptions of MT in other disciplinary areas remain largely unknown and show mixed results. A growing body of research also highlights the benefit of aplying translanguaging perspectives to the study of MT (e.g. Beiler & Dewilde, 2020; Tsai, 2022; Vogel et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2022), which can provide a counter-discourse to deficit-focused or problem-centric attitudes to international education. There is also a clear need for methodological variation, with the majority of studies focusing on students ethicality judgments relying heavily on questionnaire data e.g. Ata & Debreli, 2021; Jlley & Maimone, 2015; ut se Heugh et a., 2022. This call for use of qualitativedata collction methods such as semi-structured interviews to enable detailed and nuanced exploration of student experiences and beliefs.

# 1.5. Aims of this study

This study aims to explore the following research questions:

1. What are EAL nursing and midwifery students views on the ethics of using MT for the writing of university assgnments? 2. What factors do EAL nursing and midwifery students take into account when deciding whether to use MT for their universty assignments? 3. How do students' views on the use of MT align with deficit-oriented and translanguaging pedagogical perspectives?

# 1.6. Research paradigm, theoretical perspectives and reflexivity

This qualitative research uses a critical interpretivist paradgmatic perspective, wherey realities are seen to be socially constructed and, therefore, subject to change (Kivunja & Kuyini, 2017). Although numbers are provided for transparency, from an interpretivist qualittie pertive the voes fall students in this stdy ae onside f equal value (eny t al., 2022), redesofthe length of interview or the number of codes generated per speaker. Therefore, the results are reported according to concepts and perspectives presented in a large number of extracts.

Linking directly with the researchers explicit citical paradigm, a translanguaging perspective is used to analyse and interpret the data (especiall in response to research question 3). Translanguaging is inherently political because it questions and redescribes as sumptions about the boundarie between languages and normative language practices (Li, 2022; Pennycook, 2019). It i used in this paper to help shift university policy decision-making and societal iscussions from a defit-oriented perspective of international EAL student education (Ryan, 2020) to conceptualising astudent's multiple languages as a semiotic resource on which the student might draw in an English-dominant academic language learning environment (Li, 2022).

# 2. Method

# 2.1. Instruments

Audio-recorded semi-structured interviews with EAL students enrolled in Bachelor of Nursing and Master of Nursing and Midwifery at an Australian university $\left( \mathtt { n } = 2 3 \right)$ were conducted either by ZOOM ${ \bf ( n = 1 1 }$ ) or in-person ${ \bf ( n = 1 2 }$ . They were, on average, 25 mins in length $( 1 3 - 6 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n s } ) }$ . Topic areas for questions were divided into students' use of MT and other language assistance software (not reported in this paper) and their views on the ethics of using MT in tertiary assinment writigs (ee analys section). Semi-tructured interviewing alowed the researchers tocolectdata that was directly comparable to questions asked by previous research via surveys, while at the same time, providing participants the flexibility to discuss their views and the factors that impact on them without being prompted by the researcher.

# 2.2. Participants

In response to the above-mentioned gaps, students enrolled in a non-language focused professional degre and with a high enrolment of multilingual learners were intentionall recruited. Nursing and midwifery students were recruited due to nursing being the biggest clinical workforce in Australia (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2022), with over $4 0 \%$ of the workforce born overseas (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2022). These numbers are refected in international universty student enrolments, whereby 39,636 students with a Subclas (500) student visa were studying a health-related course in 2021 (Australian Department of Education, 2022)

The criteria for inclusion were:

enrolment in a nursing or nursing and midwifery degree. $\bullet$ self-identification as being a writer of English as an additional language

In response to arecruitment email sent to students enrolled in a Bachelor of Nursing, Bachelor of Nursing and Midwifery and Master of Nursing Practice, 1 domestic and 22 international students from a range of year levels self-selected to participate in the semistructured interviews (see Table 1). In response to demographic questions in an anonymous survey, three of the participants identified as male and 20 as female. They were aged between 18 and 36 years (average 24.21 years. The majorit of students identified as nationals of Mainland China, Hong Kong and/or Taiwan $( \mathtt { n } = 1 5 )$ I, with one of them holding dual citizenship in Hong Kong and Canada. In addition to EAL, these students had formal scholing in Cantonese and Mandarin. Two participants were Farsi speakers with Iranian nationalities with formal education in Farsi and English. The remaining students identified as nationals from Indonesia Vietnam, Fiji,Kenya, Korea, and Nigria with formal primary and secondary schooling in Bahasa, Vietnamese, Swahili,Korean, Igbo and English. Years of learning English as an additional language ranged between 4 and 30 years (average 14.6 years), with two students attending primary and secondary school entirely in English. Fiften of the 23 participants completed an IELTS academic or PTE Academic language test in order to enrol in a tertiary nursing degree in Australia.

# 2.3. Analysis

The recorded interviews were transcribed using a paid automated online software service (transcribe by wReally) and were then checked for accuracy. Ritchie and Spencer's (1994) framework for qualitative data analysis was followed to ensure systematic and flexible analysis of qualitative data, whereby the researchers individually familiarised themselves with the data, met to discus their interpretations and, based on team discussions and individual notes, created a framework for thematic analysis.

For this paper, any content relating to the topic of ethics was identified and then coded as per the process described in the previous paragraph. Due to the semi-structured nature of the interviews, the identified extracts were either spontaneously produced by the participant throughout the interviews or elicited in response to questions such as (but not limited to):

O How ethical do you think it is to use machine translation for writing your assignments?   
$\bullet$ What are your thoughts on the ethics of using machine translation for writing the whole assgnment/a paragraph/a sentence or phrase/individual words or phrases?

A total of 75 extracts for first order themes and sub-themes were elaborated in nvivo based on further discussions and interpretations of the coded data (see Table 2) and the final coded data set represents quotes from all 23 participants.

In keeping with the critical interpretivist design of this paper and to answer the third research question concerning defict-oriented and translanguaging perspective, once the codes and themes i the data had been identified, the reearchers met to discuss alignment of the students' ethical views with translanguaging or deficit-oriented educational ideologies.

The study was granted ethics approval by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Commitee (Project No. 26871). To ensure the safety and confidentiality of participants, participant numbers are used for all students and the research data and copies of informed consent forms have been retained electronically on a secure network.

# 3. Results

Analysis of interviews revealed three key themes relating to the acceptabilit f using MT for writing assignments: 1) ownership of ideas; 2) fainess and respect and 3) ethics of personal gowth. thi all thre themes, stdent quotes were demed to reflect a mix of deficit-oriented and translanguaging attitudes towards using MT for writing their assignments.

# 3.1. Ownership of ideas

Ownership of ideas played a key role in determining students' ethical stances towards use of MT, with eight of 16 students positioning themselves as the sole proprietors of their thoughts and language(s). All students considered language as the tool through which knowledge can be expressed. However,student's points of view differed in terms of the degree to which language and knowledge are inextricable and/or a loss of ownership occurs when MT is used.

As exemplified in Extract 1, participants explained that, regardlessof the language from which a concept originates, as long as they produced the text in the firs instance, the content and words legitimately belong to them. Using this logic, which aligns with a translanguaging pedagogical approach, they believed that use of MT does not contravene university plagiarism policies. Such students articulated a separation between content knowledge and language by emphasising that the use of MT does not fundamentally change the depth of knowledge or quality of the text.

# Extract 1 - Participant 23

I feel it's ok beause its sill their own work? . just write in diferent language first and then translat it? But/and if they didnt use other people's work, I think it's it's fine. (P23)

An opposing position taken by nine students was that language and knowledge are inextricably combined and therefore use of MT is unethical and results in loss of ownership of both knowledge and language. For some of these students, ethicality was not seen as dichotomous, but was framed ascalar: the grter the\*chunk f text translated, the esthical it becomes. As shown n Extract 2, this means that use of MT as a dictionary would be aceptable, however using it to translate text chunks at phrase level and above (e.g. sentences and paragraphs) was considered unethical because both the language and the idea would no longer be owned by the original writer.

# Extract 2 - Participant 5

But for translation, usuall I would prefer like translating certain keywords or some kinds of words that you don't understand instead of a whole chunk of text. Because if you translate, the whole chunk of text, it's means like those words is not coming from you, from your idea, ... and it's basically following what the internet gave you. (P5)

Students also expressed a non-scalar view whereby any use of MT equals lossof ownership. From this position, ideas and language were seen to be inextricably linked at all levels and language skill that are not in the target language were deemed irrelevant to academic writing. These students indicated that allstages of aademic writing have to happen exclusively in the English language, arguing that use of MT or any other "external tol' (Extract 3) from the word level upwards is unethical. They explained that this includes bilingual dictionaries, but not monolingual English dictionaries or grammar correction software as they believed the intial text must be produced in English. However, in Extract 3, Participant 13's use of tag-questions (It i, right?") and downgrading of an emphatic "definitely' to an epistemic marker of uncertainty I think" concurrently indicates some hesitation in this position.

# Extract 3 - Participant 13

So, if I type something in Chinese and I translated it into English, with Google Translation? Oh, that's definitely academic integrity violatin It is right? Because you didn't write your own assignment in English. I think it i a violation . it's not really your work in English, right? You just wrote in your mother tongue, or your mother language, and you used like an external tool to basically translate your work. So, I just don't think you technically wrote that piece if you use the translation services. (P13)

By creating a separation between English and any other languages, the views expressed by Participant 13 and the other eight tudents tend to align with a deficit-oriented approach, whereby the possibly extensive non-English components of their linguistic 'epertoires are not seen as a valuable resource for learning.

While this paper focuses on MT use, i is important to note that the data indicated that some students expressed a distinction between ethicality of use depending on whether a language asstance tool provides monolingual or multilingual support (Extracts 3 and 4). In Extract 4, Participant16 adhered to the idea that the dref thicalit of using M iscalar i.. dependent on the length f text being translated), but external toos that focus exclusively on English grammar and spelling corrction were clearly marked as ethical. This idea lins to the second theme of fairnes, whereby those tools that focus on the \*minor problems" of English grammar and spelling are equall accessible and valuabl to both EAL and non-EAL speakers, whereas MT i of exclusive benefit to EAL speakers.

# Extract 4 - Participant 16

I think these are two different topics. Yeah, like fixing the grammar and spelling and translating the whole passage are two different topic ...Because one is about fixing minor problems like spotting erors. Yeah, and the other is, the other is just, the other is not. The other is not really your own words. (P16)

# 3.2. Fairness and respect

Thirteen of the 23 students indicated that fairnessin comparison to other EAL and non-EAL speakers and respect towards in. stitutions and society played a key role in developing an ethical stance towards use of MT. When comparing themselves to non-EAL speakers, they indicated that use of MT levels the playing feld in academic writing by enabling them to enhance the clarity of their ideas, save time and organise their thoughts. However, in comparison to other EAL students, their use of MT may exacerbate ssues of unfairness.

# 3.2.1. Fairness - other students

A key factor in ethical positioning is the high-stakes but perceived uneven playing field in which EAL and non-EAL students are performing. Ten of the 13 students indicated that an uneven playing field has been created due to their elf-perceived limited linguistic resources (i.e. deficits) in English, which not only hinders them from expreing themseles satisfactorily when writing asignments, but restricts thr freedm f choice and  wil (xtract 5). Fr exaple in Extract 5, Participant 9 indicated the sense of fredom they have when writing in Korean i frustratingly restricted when writig in English and use of MT is one of the few tools they have at their disposal to regain the same degree of independence as those with access to this broad vocabulary would enjoy.

# Extract 5 - Participant 9

I think I'm/that's not my free will. There's no free will in writing the assinment these days because it's not because it's just not in/not in Korea. I don't have my free will in writing these days, that's kind of frustrating. (P9)

Participant 3 (Extract 6) decries another aspect of free wil in terms of freedom to chose which language ssistance tools bes suit the student's language and learning needs. They equate their fre choice to use MT as a bilingual dictionary to that of a non-EAL speaker's choice to use a monolingual dictionary. They relate ethical positioning to a sense of independence and agency in which both EAL and non-EAL students "can do what they want' in order to complete their required assessments.

# Extract 6 - Participant 3

if you're not using it, like Australians are at an advantage, so like it doesnt kind of make sense. , its ethical [. even if I knew actual Australians were using, English to English dictionary and I was able to use Persian to English and English to English atthe same time. I'm cool with it. They can do what they want. I can do what I want at that. (P3)

These students indicated that non-EAL speakers hold a privileged position simply by virtue of the fact that they have been raised with English as one of their first languages (Extract 7) and argued that MT provides EAL students the opportunity to equalise the advantages of having had extensive prior socialisation and exposure to the English language. From a translanguaging perspective, these opinions indicate that EAL students are operating in a deficit-oriented educational environment in which only English language skil are valued, but  provides an opportunity to move to translanguaging pedagogical model, where al Ianguage skils are able to be accessed for assessment writing.

# Extract 7 - Participant 22

if you are like an international student like me and sometime t s unfair compared to the local students because you don't have the privilege of having English as your first language. (P22)

While some of these students adhered to a deficit-oriented view of their own abilities and language backgrounds, others argued that EAL students have had the same exposure to words and concepts, the only diffrence being that it was not in an English language environment. For example, in Extract 8, Participant 3 indicated they believed all of the languages a student has attheir disposal should be accessed, utilised and valued in academic writing. Participant 3 indicated that restricting a students' abilit to useMT has moral implications (\*morally wrong")- it is discriminatory (disadvantaged") and nonsensical (it makes no sense). They argue that the reasons for MT inhibiting use are not based on reason (i.e. "sense") and place EAL students at a disadvantage.

# Extract 8 - Participant 3

Yeah, I think it is ethical. I don't think there is anything morally wrong with it [..] Let's say someone who was born, here, has advantage of hearing those words over and over again from the second they were born and up until the time they were writing an assignment whereas someone like me or someone who's been here for a year or even less than me has not heard those words in their lives and they might obviously know that word in their language because they've heard it, but they do not know it in English [ ..] we're pretty much disadvantaged because we don't know it [ .] let'say that person did not have aess to anything then they're not going be able to get those point acrossfor that p-/for that reason only. So it ust makes no sense to not be able to use ths stuf and for them to forbid. Oh you can't use the dictionary. why not? you know like (laughs it doesn't make sense yeah. (P3)

Inequalities in the time it takes for EAL and non-EAL students to write academic asessments was mentioned by two students as another aspect that influenced their ethical stances towards the use of MT. They argued that while the overall time students are provided to complete an assignment is the same, theactual time it takes for an EAL student to write in an aditional language i longer than that of a non-EAL counterpart. One student (Participant 22) reported a discussion with a non-EAL "local friend" who indicated that they typicall spend about two hours writing an essay, which compared directl to Participant 22's own experience of needing to spend like two weeks on it." This argument was applied to the oerall writing proces, and also to the proces f writing the firs drat of the text. For example, in Extrct 9, Participant 8 indicated that a key means of saving time is writing theassignment in the student's non-English languages, which then needs to be translated and revised again.

# Extract 9 - Participant 8

I don't think it's not ethical because ay, someone, their first language is not English, of course, they're better at writing in their own language. So they're beter at at expressing their own thoughts in their own language. So, probably it saves more time and later you can translate. (P8)

At the same time, the time-saving nature of MTs was also used to support claims of unethicality and creation of unfainess by two Jarticipants, whereby those students who use MT can complete their assessments faster than those who do not. However, this argument was only made in relation to other EAL speakers. Inherent to their claim is that use of MT shows student's lack of effort and ime investment, which allows them to gain an unfair advantage over other EAL students who choose not to use MT (Extract 10).

# Extract 10 - Participant 7

cause you learning English, ll the lecture and workshops you do it in English, but in the assessment you write in/like for me if I write in/allin Chinese and translat it's like just not od. It's like, hm, not fir to other students because not everyone will do this. Like my friends if she or he is also Chinese, they will try their best to write the essay in English and use the assessment tools to fix the words but I write all things in Chinese and translate them. So I don't feel good, like, doing this way. (P7)

Students also indicated that by using MT to shorten the length of time required to achieve equal exposure to words and concepts they will become les rliant on those same tols over time. Independence in this sense referred not to ther frdom to write, but their independence from those very tools that assist them to emerge as autonomous writers of English. Students indicated that this process towards independence is linked directly to ethics, particularly in those cases where students do not reduce their apparent reliance on MT. These students argue that use should be a temporary measure that wl gradually lead to writing that is independent of translation devices.

Students both explicitly and implicitly indicated that gradual independence from MT that expands their lexical range must logically be linked to incrsed English language roficiency. Their considerations are, therefore, linked to the thics of language lning in an English medium of instruction teaching environment. Students indicated that they do not see themselves as passive consumers of suggestions produced by MT and part of their ethical decision-making involves evaluating MT output before incorporating it into their assignments. At the same time, their focus on transitioning to an English-only medium indicates they place low value in the contributions of non-English components of their linguistic repertoires and, therefore, adhere to a deficit-oriented perspective of interna tional and multilingual education.

# 3.2.2. Respect - institutions and broader society

The broader context of teaching and learning was another factor impacting on students' ethical decision making. Eight of 13 students indicated that sues such as respect for local languages and educational systems play a role in their ethical considerations, particularly in terms of the language that is used in assessment material (e. rubrics) and by lecturer, assssors and students. As Participant 24 noted, writig asignments in English issign of respect for the country in which they are studying: \*ut we are studying in an English country, that's / who speak English, so I think we need to respect the language that/in a country." (P24)

Stemming from a deficit-orientation, for these students this meant that use of a language other than English is unacceptable at any stage during the writing proces (e.g. planning) because it does not match with the English medium of instruction (Extract 11). They indicated ths creates an ethical dilemma for which they may fel guilty or bad (Extract 10): they do not believe use of MT is ethical. but, as indicated in another section of Participant 12's interview, they use MT under certain circumstances because the stakes in assessed academic writing are high.

Extract 11 - Participant 12

English is our top language. it's like the tool / communication tool between me and the marker. And I think in terms of advancing your grades, you should always try your best to think in Englis.[. its [..] actually not fair to other students [] because some students maybe like me, although they struggle with lik fluent English writing, I will silltry my best to plan, write in English because it's the school and the lecturers allpeople are communicating with English language. (P12)

# 3.3. Ethics of personal growth

Unlike faness and respect, which was positioned in relation to others, ethics of personal growth are exclusively about the elf as a lifelong learner, particularly in terms of language acquisitio, higher order thinking, and career development post-graduation. However, participants' views diffred as to whether using MT could jeopardise or improve their lifelong learning goals.

As exemplified in Extract 12, four students indicated that they believe that use of MT is "good for your thinking" (P4) and. oncurrently, accelerates English language acquisition.

# Extract 12 - Participant 4

it can help you keep learning English as well like, when I do the research like I can learn more English words. (P4)

Eleven other students, however, held the view that using MT might compromise their learning journeys, both in terms of the English language and their disciplinary knowledge. For example, in Extract 13, Participant 12 indicated that reaching their lfelong goals and getting the most out of their time studying and working in an English-medium environment necesstates an English-only mindset whereby they refrain from using their non-English resources. This evokes a monolingual rather than a translanguaging approach to their learning.

# Extract 13 - Participant 12

Chinese is also the language, but then I fel like you dont get the most of it You can't get the best of the assignment experience as in the learning journey. You can't get the best f it [..] because in your future career, you're not communicating Chinese. That's why even like for me, I wil try my best to think in English and write in English, although sometimes, okay in my brain there are some Chinese to be like waiting for translation, but then I will sill try my best. Okay think in English. (P12)

The ethics of personal growth are influenced by several contextual factors such as students' post editing engagement with MTs purpose of use (i.e. saving time vs. language learning) and users intention to return to their country of origin ater graduation. For example, in Extract 14, Participant 4 argues that ethicality depends on how users engage with M. They indicate that, on the one hand, using MT to save time i unthical. On the ther hand, f uers engage wit all of the texts in the traslation process and use them as an opportunity for language learning, MT use is ethical.

# Extract 14 - Participant 4

H look [at] both. Not just the Chinese version directly, lok at both [..] I always check like how they explain this sentence in my language. So thats good way for me to learn English as wel [..] I believe that beingalifelong learner that would be good.So, I always keep learning. So, I prefer to use English. That's the why I study abroad. Okay, so maybe they are lazy, they don't want to do it, it's time-saving, it is too fast for them to finish the assessment. (P4)

# 3.4. Summary of key findings

The above results indicate that students take three main considerations into account when making ethical decisions concerning the use of MT for academic writing purposes: 1) ownership of language and ideas; 2) fainess and respect in relation to other students, society and institutions; and 3) personal growth. However, the results also indicate that within these key themes, student positionings vary widely, resulting in a range of arguments, conclusions and approaches to the ethics of using MT. While ll students seemed cognisant of ethical ssues, their views wer individualised and divergent. The reults show that the student decisions as t whether to use MT are not dichotomous, but scalar, srategic and dynamic and highlight the importance of expanding discussions about student use of MT at university beyond academic integrity to address other ethical ssues, including linguistic gatekeeping and student equity (see Paterson, 2023). Questions of ethicality that move beyond issues of academic integrity tap into broader individual, social and institutional constructs of fainess skills recognition, lifelong learning and language dominion. The findings highlight not only the complexity of this topic, but also the diversity of factors which students consider when deciding on how to ethically write their assignments.

# 4. Discussion

Students in this and previous studies indicate that ethicality is not a blanket yes' or 'no' decision, but one that is dependent on variables such as ength of text and engagement in post-editing practices (Alhaisoni & Alhaysony, 2017; Ata & Debreli, 2021; Clifford et al., 2013; Jolle & Mamone, 2015; Liu et l., 2022). In line with Dors et al. (2022), participants in this research did not mention any concerns regarding the translation of confidential or sensitive information, data management/ownership or the handing of cultural references or bias. This study highlihts other factors that students take into account that ae not linked to the length or content of the text but to their own perspectives and principles of ownership, fairness, respect and personal growth.

Reflecting ongoing societal debates in which the relationship between author and translator in litrary contexts remains highly contested (e.g. Zhang & He, 2018),students focused mainly on the degre to which the student or machine retains proprietorship of the language produced. Institutional clarity concerning the point at which a text no longer becomes the sole property of the writer when using MT does not seem to be available to students, wherey universty guidelines only highlight the distinction between using technology to revise student writing or generate original work (e.g. Monash University, n.d.).

Despite such a lack of clarity in terms of universty policies (Dinneen, 2021; Kim & LaBianca, 2018) and institutional failure to prepare students for what they consider to be appropriate use of MT (Heugh et al., 2022), EAL students in this study semed aware that use of MT is linked to academic integrity. While some students framed use of MT as cheating (Correa, 2014; Dinneen, 2021; Harrs, 2010; Steding, 2009), others described MT as a tool that can be honestly and ethicall incorporated into writing practices. These studentse use of MT s simply a means by which they can expressthir own thoughts and ideas clearly, thereby supporting, rather than hindering, academic integrity processes.

Uncertainty in terms of the ethics of MT use highlight the fact that defintions of academic integrity (including plagiarism) are both locally and socially constructed, therefore ascertaining ownership is invariably contextually-specific (Anson, 2022). A key contextual factor to be taken into consideration is that of assessment. As highlighted by this and previous studies, while ssues of academic integrity arise when the aim of the task i to evaluate students' linguistic competencies in a particular language (e.g. Correa, 2011, 2014), they are essalient when the aim of the assesment is the display of content knowledge. Students from a non-language-focused discipline in this study, indicated that MT allows clear expression of thought, which means they are more able to devote their cognitive resources to demonstrate their content knowledge and disciplinary competencies (Lee & Briggs, 2021).

# 4.1. Translanguaging and deficit-oriented ideological discourses

Although the students were never directly asked to define their ethical perspectives, their views often align with either trans. languaging or deficit-oriented ideological discourses. Similar to the student participants in Heugh et l. (2022), some of the nursing and midwifery students in this study productively drew on multiple languages despite operating within the constraints of an English-medium course. This indicates they viewed their use of MT as an educative (Briggs, 2018; Delorme Benites et al., 2021; Garcia & Pena, 2011; Murtisari et al., 2019) translanguaging resource (Chen et al., 2019; Heugh et a., 2022; Vogel et al., 2018; Zhou e al., 2022) that allowed them to draw on, and advance, thir own semiotic resources (Beiler & Dewilde, 2020; Chen et al., 2019; Heugh et al., 2022; Kelly & Hou, 2022; Tsai, 2022; Vogel e al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2022). In other words, by positioning themselves in what could be considered a translanguaging space (Li, 2011, 2018), they are ale to draw on all f the linguistc ailities and language tools they have at their disposal (Garcia & Kleifgen, 2020; Paulsrud et al., 2017; Van Viegen & Zappa-Hollman, 2020)

Students in this study also saw global education as an exclusively English-only environment, where the use of multiple languages is discouraged and considered ethicall inappropriate. For these students, the E' in English medium of instruction' refers to a static standardised prestigious language system (Kuteeva, 2020), rather than a local practice (Pennycook, 2010) that is malleable to adaptation according to the individualised expression of it users and contexts of use. This aligns with a monolingual English mindset (Clyne, 2005; Sharma, 2021) and a deficit-oriented view of their own language bilities (Ryan, 2020; Tardy & Whittig, 2017), in which students may experience feelings f gilt (  Dikilitas 2022) or discomfort (Beer & Dwilde, 2020) when drawing ontheir other languages, including any of their post-colonial non-standardised English as lingua franca varieties.

Employment of a translanguaging perspective provides students, faculty and institutions the opportunity to chllenge monolingual ideologies and the privileging of English as the sole medium of scholarship (Li, 2022). Atranslanguaging approach could be a means of overcoming the negative repercussions of a monolingual English mindset (Clyne, 2005) in global education and contribute essential insight into decision-making processes for universties to clarify the parameters of ethical use of MT. From a translanguaging perspective, whil languaging and cognition are inextricably entwined (e.g. Canagarajah, 2018), allof a student's language belongs to a unified reertoire and drawing onMT to access the entirety of this reertoire for the expression of thought is ethical. t follows that using M ds not result in a los of ownershi, insted i enables students to aces and expand allof the ngage resources they hae at their disposal. From this point of view, policies and associated training permiting use of MT for tertiary education lay the foundations for allstudents to be provided equal opportunity to utilise their individual cognitive, linguistic and technological resource in often high-stakes universit asment sttings. The dre whch this i efetive is, hwver, dedt on whther aes o MT remains paywall free.

This study highlights the need for universtie to not only take an informed and clear stance on the use of MT in tertiary education, but, in forming such policies, take highly complex issues of fairnes, translanguaging, ownership and individual personal gowth into account. Using semi-structured interviews, the study gives voice to the breadth of ethical considerations students orient towards in relation to the use of MT in academic writing, thereby shifing the debate beyond simple considerations of academic integrity. The voices of the students in this study also highlight the depth and complexity of their thoughts when engaging with MT. They do not blindly utilise MT, but reflect and act upon their own informed value-based ethical decision-making processes.

The perspectives of academic educators are equally important and form part of the larger project in which this paper is embedded, as is data focusing on students actual use of MT and the impact f use of MT and other language assistance software on the perceived quality of a student's writing. While this research provides a valuable snapshot of a range of ethical positionings, i should be kept in mind that data was collcted from a small number of self-selecting EAL nursing and midwifery students, rendering it dificult to generalise the findings of this reearch to all EAL students. Future rearch could expand the focus beyond nursing and midwifery and, in line with translanguaging approaches to languaging, recruit a wide range of students irrespective of their restrictively defined monolingual or multilingual language backgrounds. Other factors that might mediate students ethical positionings (e.g. text type, summative versus formative assessments, discipline of study) should also be explored.

# 5. Conclusion

This study extends our understanding of EAL and international students' attitudes towards technology beyond the tertiary disci plines of language acquisition and translation studies. Analysis of tudent voices reveal the key themes, which highlight the need to broaden discussions concerning use of MT beyond academic integrity to socio-contextual isues of: 1) ownership of both language and thought; 2) fairness and respectacross and within EAL and non-EAL cohort, institutions and society; and 3) the ethics of personal growth.

In light of call for universities to develop clear policies and guidelines for using MT and other online tools for the alteration or generation of tet (e.g paraphrasing tols, Grammarly), findings can contribute to the development of evidence-based and productive approaches to the use of MT in higher education. Of particular significance is the need for universities to broaden restrctive defintions of language as fite entities to translanguaging perspectives that acknowledge the extensive communicative repertoires that students should be encouraged to draw on in order to complete their studies.

This study shows that EAL students themselves are reflecting on philosophical, legal and ethical questions, and not blindly engaging in practices that could potentially harm their learning. They did not necessrily frame their use of MT as cheating, instead they indicated a variety of ways in which MT can be applied to academic writing contexts and drawn upon to access the previously under. alued array of inuistc resources they posses. With this increased understanding of how students think critically about their writing processes and use of MT, educators can take an informed, translanguaging and strength-oriented approach to supporting EAL students' assignment writing, which draws on their expanded repertoire of resources.

In the context of widespread concern that technological advancements will result in students outsourcing their learning (Paterson 2023), the findings of this study indicate a counter-discourse in which EAL students follow ethical principles of ownership of ideas and language, fairnes, respect and personal growth. The study assts, therefore, in moving towards a view of EAL students as "responsible and effective global citizens' (e.g. Monash Universit, 2021, p. 1) possessing a wealth of lnguistic and cultural resources and with inherently ethical approaches to their own lifelong learning and self-improvement practices.
