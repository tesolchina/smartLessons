Knowing how to use sources effectively often poses considerable challenges for first year undergraduate students for whom English is a second language (L2). In this longitudinal case study we investigated the selection and self-reported use of source materials by thirteen first year L2 undergraduate students from a range of disciplines enrolled at a major Australian university. Our findings show that students at the beginning of their studies selected material from a wide range of sources but relied predominantly on Internet sources using Google as a search engine. The main criteria guiding students selection of sources were authoritativeness, ease of understanding and relevance. By the end of the first year, not all students (notably those from Engineering, Science and Music) were able to report further on their use of sources, as they had not undertaken any independent research in the second half of the year. In contrast, students from Arts, who also tended to be more proficient L2 learners, continued to undertake research-based assignments and demonstrated an awareness of the role played by task type, argumentation and writer authority in their selection and use of sources. We conclude this paper by considering the implications of these findings for EAP pedagogy and future research.

# 1. Introduction

Selecting and incorporating source materials effectively into academic writing requires students not only to be familiar with defined areas of disciplinary content, but also to be able to represent themselves through their writing as articulate and authoritative authors. How do students know which authors to select or what kind of source materials to use? What is the role, if any, of disciplinary field of study, background knowledge, lecturer involvement, task type, linguistic complexity and accessibility in source selection? Are sources used to provide all propositional content, or used strategically to provide evidence to support and/or refute students’ opinions? There are other equally important questions to ask: for example, how do students perform the kinds of linguistic and authorial intertextual manipulations that enable them to summarise, paraphrase and synthesise source materials effectively into their own research-based writing? How do students overcome problems associated with copying, and how do they use citation systems and attribution protocols appropriately in order to signal textual ownership?

Being able to meet such demands, especially for L2 students, involves engaging at a deep level with a range of complex and interconnected processes relating to power and representation that underpin the creation of all texts (Bourdieu, 1991; Foucault, 1984). Cultural difference in the use of attribution and sources (Pennycook, 1996; Thompson, 2009), a lack of linguistic resources (Currie, 1998; Storch, 2009) in combination with the demands posed by particular task types and writing contexts (Howard, 1996; Pecorari, 2003), have all been posited as possible factors that may compound the difficulties that L2 students experience as they attempt to construct texts, knowledge and authorial identities in their chosen fields of disciplinary study.

In recognition of these challenges, Australian universities offer L2 students various forms of instruction or support in English for Academic Purposes (EAP). However, it is difficult to establish a correlation between instruction and development in the academic writing of L2 students because of the range and complexity of issues involved (e.g. Leki, 2007). This study, part of a larger research project into the development of academic literacy, aims to enhance our understanding of the nature of the challenges faced by L2 undergraduate students as they attempt to engage with their chosen areas of study in their first year of university. More specifically, the study investigates students’ perceptions of their selection and use of sources, and their authoring practices, over the period of an academic year. We conclude by considering the implications of our findings for EAP pedagogy. Our study is timely since research to date on advanced L2 writing development over time is relatively scarce (Leki, 2007; Storch, 2009; Storch & Tapper, 2009).

# 2. Review of the literature

University-level study requires students to develop a range of advanced literacy practices that will equip them to engage effectively with their chosen fields of disciplinary study. One such literacy practice is the writing of a research-based paper. These papers require students to engage with various source materials to address specific topic areas and task requirements relating to the particular assignments they have been set. When undertaking such research-based writing, students not only need to know what kind of sources to select that align with the aims and scope of their assignment tasks, they also need to know how to incorporate these sources effectively into their writing. An additional characteristic of academic writing lies in its powers of persuasive argumentation which relate to the ways in which disciplinary knowledge is dialectically constructed (Bazerman, 1988). For students to engage effectively with these rhetorical aspects of academic writing, they need to be able to develop a sense of their how their own authoring practices shape the ways in which they represent their own ideas in relation to those of the authors of the source texts they employ. There are a number of studies in the literature that have explored the use of sources in academic writing from the kinds of perspectives outlined above by students for whom English is a first language (L1) as well as by students from L2 English backgrounds.

Some of the studies relating to students’ source selection are in the field of L1 writing. Huon, Spehar, Adam, and Rifkin (2007) for example, investigated the use of sources by 514 first year undergraduate L1 Psychology students found that students selected a variety of source materials which included textbooks, web-based lecture notes and online quizzes. The scope of this study was limited, however, because students’ selections were made only from the resources that were made available to them by their course lecturers and tutors and did not extend to materials that they might have selected independently. The research design of an earlier study by Burton and Chadwick (2000) was more open-ended. The researchers surveyed 543 university L1 students from 97 different study majors on their use of library (print-based) compared with Internet sources. They found that the three factors that were ranked the most highly by all students (approximately $9 3 \%$ of whom were undergraduates) in their selection and evaluation of both types of sources were: availability, ease of understanding and accessibility. The majority of these students $( 7 8 \% )$ used ‘outside sources’ compared with $2 2 \%$ who confined their source use to course textbooks only (Burton & Chadwick, 2000, p. 317). These researchers also reported that the majority $( 6 2 \% )$ of first year undergraduates (50 out of the 81) were required to produce a research-based paper in their first year of university study. This is a finding that conflicts with research by Leki (2007) into the academic literacy practices of L2 undergraduates, in which she reported on the little amount of research-based writing that appeared to be assigned to undergraduate students from across the disciplines.

It is evident that in the last decade or so there has been an important shift in the main types of sources selected by students, from print to electronic-based resources. This has occurred as a result of the development of the Internet as a repository for both scholarly and general information. This major change in the development of information technology has created a generation of so-called ‘digital natives’ (Prensky, 2001) who have grown up using a variety of computermediated technologies. Clearly this change has had a major impact not only on how students approach the research process, but also on how they compose their written texts. As Stapleton (2005) points out, the ease with which students can type key words into search engines to locate source materials raises a number of critical questions to do with the formation of opinions and values, linguistic development and the ethics of scholarship which demand attention from educators across the academy.

In terms of incorporating sources into writing, it is clear that some students will use sources for the purposes of contentbased learning and linguistic development, although not all students may know how to incorporate this source material appropriately into their writing. Plakans and Gebril (2012), for example, investigated the use of sources in integrated reading/ writing tasks by 145 undergraduate L2 university students, out of whom nine students volunteered to participate in think aloud protocols and to be interviewed. The researchers concluded that all students availed themselves of the language resources offered by each source text, with most students using sources in order to form opinions about their composition topics and some to find evidence to support their opinions. However, as Pecorari (2008) found in a study of 17 postgraduate L2 students, over-reliance on reproducing the language and ideas from source texts may lead to inappropriate forms of copying and attribution. Importantly though, Pecorari argued that such behaviours were not deliberate on the part of the students; rather they might signal difficulties relating to paraphrasing, which in some cases resulted in a tendency to ‘patchwrite’ (‘copying from a source text then deleting some words, altering grammatical structures, or plugging in one-for-one synonymsubstitutes’, Howard, 1992, p. 233).

An important aspect of using sources effectively is understanding the rhetorical exigences of academic writing. Scholars such as Angélil-Carter (2000), Clark and Ivani-c (1997), Starfield (2002) and Thompson (2005) have pointed out that knowing how to use the specialised language and discourse features of specific disciplinary fields in rhetorically appropriate and authoritative ways eludes many students, especially those entering their first year of university study. Viewing oneself as an ‘author’ is central to this process:

feeling authoritative . feeling the right to exert a presence in the text . [being] in control of the act of writing . be [ing] not just ‘writers’ but ‘authors’ with the authority to say something (Clark & Ivani-c, 1997, pp. 152–153).

A recent multi-institutional citation project investigated many of these issues by looking at the research-based writing of 174 first year students from 16 colleges and universities in the United States (Jamieson & Howard, 2011). The study showed that almost $2 5 \%$ of citations were to journal articles, $1 8 \%$ to books, $2 5 \%$ to web-based sources and approximately $2 6 \%$ were to sources of two pages or fewer in length. The authors concluded that this indicated that students may not be have been able to distinguish clearly between ‘reliable’ and completely ‘inappropriate’ sources for college and university level research. The researchers also found that only $6 \%$ of students’ citations presented summaries of the ideas they had found in their source materials. A total of $9 4 \%$ of students’ citations were either direct quotations $( 4 6 \% )$ , paraphrases $( 3 2 \% )$ or patchwritten $( 1 6 \% )$ ; approximately $4 \%$ of citations were directly copied with no attribution. Jamieson and Howard concluded that in the majority of cases students had failed to engage with ideas from across their source texts as a whole. The authors also argued that students’ lack of summarising revealed a failure to synthesise ideas from across their source materials; this in turn, was indicative of students’ inability to understand key ideas in depth.

The above review of the literature highlights the importance of source selection as well as source use in relation to emergent authorship in shaping the academic writing practices of university students. Our study aims to extend the scope of this literature by adopting a longitudinal case study approach with a focus on tracking L2 students’ perceptions about their use of sources and development as academic writers over a period of two semesters (24 weeks) of full-time study. Our study thus responds to the call by leading researchers in the field of second language acquisition, such as Ortega and Byrnes (2008), for longitudinal, qualitative research into advanced language abilities. In addition, much of the research in the area of academic writing to date has focused on the perspectives of discipline specialists and English for Academic Purposes instructors rather than those of students (Hyland & Hamp-Lyons, 2005). The focus of our study is therefore on students’ perceptions of their academic writing, thus enabling us as educators to work reflexively on furthering our understanding of ‘our students’ textual and language learning worlds’ (Pennycook, 1996, p. 227).

Our project sought to address three central research questions:

1. What kind of sources do first year undergraduate L2 students select? Do these practices change over time?   
2. How do students describe the ways in which they incorporate source texts into their research-based writing? Do these practices change over time?   
3. How do students describe their authoring practices in relation to their use of sources in their research-based writing? Do these practices change over time?

# 3. The present study

# 3.1. The context

The study was conducted in a large metropolitan university in Australia. The university attracts a large number of international students, particularly from China and South East Asia. The Faculty of Business & Commerce (formerly Economics & Commerce) attracts the largest number of international students. In order to support the academic language needs of international students, a number of credit-bearing EAP subjects have been developed. At the undergraduate level these include two general EAP subjects: Academic English 1 (AE1) and Academic English 2 (AE2) and one discipline specific EAP subject: Academic English for Economics/Commerce (AE Eco/Com). These subjects are semester long (12 weeks). All students who enrol in these subjects have met the standard English language entry requirements for university study (an overall score of 6.5 on the International English Language Testing System, or equivalent on other proficiency tests). Students self-select or are advised by course advisors to enrol in these subjects in order to improve their academic language and literacy.

Placement in these EAP subjects is determined largely by English language proficiency scores (e.g. IELTS writing scores, Australian final year of secondary school ESL scores) or scores obtained on a diagnostic writing test administered by the university. Students with a relatively high proficiency level (e.g. IELTS writing score of 7) are placed in AE2; those with a threshold level (e.g. IELTS writing score of 6.5) are placed in AE1. Students whose primary discipline of study is Economics and Commerce are recommended to enrol in AE Eco/Com. Therefore in this subject, students’ language proficiency is more varied than in AE1 or AE2. However, some Commerce students choose to enrol in AE1 or AE2 rather than AE Eco/Com.

These EAP subjects aim to develop learners’ academic language, with a particular focus on developing academic writing. In classes devoted to the use of academic sources, students discuss what sources need to be acknowledged and why as well as the veracity of various sources of information. For example, we discuss in classes the appropriacy of using wikipedia as a source when completing academic assignments. Explicit instruction and practice on how to incorporate and acknowledge sources to support an argument follow. Students practice paraphrasing, summarising and synthesizing skills and receive feedback on their use of sources. All major assignments in these EAP subjects require students to use sources. (For a more detailed account of the nature of instruction on the use of sources in one of these EAP subjects, see Storch, 2012.)

# 3.2. Data collection

The project employed a longitudinal case study approach. At the start of the year, 13 students volunteered to participate in the project. Four students were enrolled in AE1, four in AE2 and five in AE Eco/Com. Each student completed an initial language and study background survey. Five interviews with each student were scheduled throughout the year: at the beginning, middle and end of the first semester; then at the beginning and end of the second semester. Of the thirteen original students, a total of ten attended all five interviews. Interviews were semi-structured and based in part on students’ written assignments. Data collected included copies of students’ written assignments (once they had been graded), from both their Academic English subjects and their other subjects, as well as any documentation relating to these assignments. However, for this paper we focus mainly on the data elicited in the interviews.

The aim of the first interview (conducted within the first four weeks of Semester 1) was to explain the aims of our project in more detail, and to get to know our participants better. In Interviews 2–5 (undertaken between Week 8 of Semester 1 and the end of Semester 2) we focused on addressing the three research questions outlined above (see Appendix A for interview questions).

Table 1 below summarises the information we gathered from the initial surveys (all names used are pseudonyms). As the table shows, the majority of the students were of Chinese L1 background reflecting the predominant L1 background of international students at our university. Since these were undergraduate students, their age range was 18–21. Only one of the students (Helen) had arrived in Australia at the beginning of the university academic year. All other participants had completed one or two years of high school or foundation courses in Australia, prior to enrolling at the university.

# 4. Data analysis

The interviews were transcribed, and these transcriptions formed the main source of our data for this paper. Data were analysed thematically. In the first stage, an initial broad set of categories was established based on our research questions and an iterative reading of the interview data. Then the categories were applied to a subsample of the data that was coded by each of the researchers. Subsequent comparison and discussion helped to establish a final set of categories that captured the student responses and ensured consistency of analysis.

We also compared students’ responses in the interviews conducted in the middle and end of the first semester with the number and type of sources they cited in their EAP assignments. This enabled us to verify the reliability of students’ responses; that is, whether what they said they did in the interviews aligned with what they actually did in some of their assignments.

# 5. Findings and discussion

The following section is organised around the three research questions. In response to the first question, we describe the types of sources students used and the criteria they used to select sources. The second research question is addressed by reporting on the different ways students incorporated sources in their academic writing. In response to research question three, we summarise how students described their changing relationships with the source materials they read and the texts they wrote. For all three questions, we describe change over time where this is relevant. Importantly, the data that we discuss here are students’ perceptions of their practices.

5.1. What kind of sources do students select? Do these practices change over time?

Table 2 presents the main types of sources students reported that they used. At the beginning of the year, the Internet (websites and wikipedia) and subject materials provided by lecturers were the main sources that students used in their research-based assignments. Nine students of the 13 interviewed mentioned the Internet and eight mentioned subject materials. A check of sources cited, for example, by the students interviewed in their first assignment in AE $\mathsf { E c o } / \mathsf { C o m } ^ { 1 }$ showed that websites were the predominant source ( $3 6 \%$ of sources cited), followed by government websites $( 2 5 \% )$ and texts $( 2 4 \% )$ . When accessing Internet sources, Google seemed to be the favoured search engine to locate websites, with students reporting that they performed key word searches to narrow the topic.

Towards the end of the first semester (Interview 3), websites were superseded by newspapers (particularly for the Economics/Commerce students) and journals as students’ preferred source materials. Wikipedia was no longer mentioned. A check of citations in the final EAP assignment for the semester of the students interviewed found that the predominant type of source cited in the assignments of the AE Eco/Com students was newspapers $4 1 \%$ of sources cited); in AE2 it was journal articles ( $4 4 \%$ of sources cited); and in AE1 it was book chapters $3 9 \%$ of sources cited). However, in AE1 and AE2, almost half of the book chapters and journals cited were provided in the subject readers.

Data from Interview 4 show a resurgent use of websites and a continued reliance on subject materials. However, we also see evidence of some independent text-based research with journal articles and book chapters becoming the most popular source types (mentioned by seven students). Data from Interview 5 show a decline in students’ use of sources. This decrease may reflect the fact that it was mostly the students from Arts who were required to undertake research-based assignments in Semester 2. Others reported that they were required to undertake very little research for their assignments, and where research was required, it was confined to their specific subject materials.

Although students continued to use the Internet to access sources throughout the year, their use generally became more targeted, with most students reporting in the second half of the year that they could use university-based search engines such as Supersearch and that they were becoming more familiar with and more confident with academic search engines. For example, Kath (AE Eco/Com) (Interview 3) reported that she had started using ‘more professional search engines such as Supersearch’ 2 but added that she also used a number of ‘Chinese websites and translated the information into English’. By Interview 4, Fenfang (AE Eco/Com) also stated that she used Supersearch as it was more useful than Google ‘because you get so much waste and too much information’ with Google.

Students were also asked about what criteria guided their source selection. The reasons motivating students’ selection of sources are summarised in Table 3 below. In Interview 2 the most common reasons given were that sources needed to be authoritative and reliable. These reasons were perhaps related to the most common source of information used: websites (see Table 2 above). Students were clearly aware that not all websites provided equally suitable sources of information. However, it was not always clear how they determined what made certain websites authoritative or reliable. One student, for example, (James, AE Eco/Com) said that he googled the topic and then chose books written by professors. Concerns about reliability of information also help to explain the reliance on materials provided by subject lecturers.

Other important criteria guiding source choice were ease of understanding and relevance. Ease of understanding also ranked highly in Burton and Chadwick’s study (2000), even though their student cohort consisted predominantly of first year L1 undergraduate students. Wette (2010), in her study of undergraduates’ use of sources, also drew attention to the importance of being able to understand source materials for both L1 and L2 students. An interesting strategy adopted by one of our participants, Qing (a Biomedicine student in AE1), was to use videos as an initial source to help her gain an understanding of and an interest in her assignment topic (Chinese–European relationships on the goldfields in the middle of the nineteenth century in Australia), before she began her search for sources:

Video or DVD have some ... voice ... I have a better idea [than] ... I will have a better understanding... make me interested in the topic. The book usually have too much new words. With the video recording they use more informal words making me understand first.

By Interview 5, there are indications that some of the students had become more sophisticated in selecting sources, showing an awareness of task and discipline as important criteria in guiding source selection.

5.2. How do students describe the ways in which they incorporate source texts into their research-based writing? Do these practices change over time?

At the beginning of the year (Interview 2) when students were asked why they used sources, the most common response was that they used them to support their own opinions. Qing (a Biomedicine student in AE1) stated that she paraphrased sections of her reading that supported her own argument and ignored those that presented opposing views. Judy (an Arts student in AE2) also struggled to present ideas that differed from her own, recognising that: ‘sometimes I lack of the other side’. Another student, Nhung (AE Eco/Com) commented that generally he began by writing ‘a statement’ or ‘topic sentence’, followed by his ‘argument’, which he then supported with evidence from sources. The second paragraph from the body of his first assignment in AE Eco/Com illustrates this strategy. Key terms (inflation) and arguments (firms’ inability to reject wage demands) are followed by citations.

Firstly, economic growth has strong effects on inflation. If the economy is growing too fast, it leads to high inflation rates. “Inflation is a rising general level of prices” (Jackson & McIver, 2001: 160). When the economy is growing, it leads to an increase in goods and services demand. As a result, the price of goods mounts up due to supply-demand rule. Because of the rising in price, workers ask for higher wages to cover their higher expenses. Besides this, firms’ owners tend to not reject the wage demand as their businesses are doing well (Jackson & McIver, 2001: 161). As a consequence, higher wages for workers leads to a higher cost in producing goods.

This finding that using sources was generally limited to providing support for students’ own opinions concurs with a study by Plakans and Gebril (2012), which showed that L2 undergraduates used sources as evidence to support their own opinions in an integrated reading/writing task.

Knowing when and how often to reference source texts was also identified as an important issue for students in thei nterviews at the start of the year. Only one student talked about the process as being quite straightforward:

When I use people’s ideas I . acknowledge the author said this, the author argues this, and the author believes that .   
and I use the bracket (Alex, AE Eco/Com).

Interestingly, Alex’s EAP assignments were among those with the highest number of citations. Other students expressed concern about when to acknowledge references.

For some, the issue was identified as forgetfulness:

Sometimes I write something that is not my own opinion, but I have forgotten where I found the sources, so I don’t include the source (Nhung AE Eco/Com).

In other cases, the issue was seen in terms of a simple lack of understanding about the mechanics of referencing. For example, Fenfang (AE Eco/Com) admitted that she was not sure how to follow the APA referencing examples provided in one of her subject guides. Her first EAP assignment contained a number of errors including inconsistent acknowledgements and incorrect listing of sources. Another student (Yves, AE2) explained that he used paraphrasing as a way of incorporating source texts into his own writing, but did not always reference these ideas. These findings build on those of previous studies that highlight the challenges undergraduate students face in learning how to reference appropriately (e.g. Angélil-Carter, 2000; Starfield, 2002; Thompson, 2005).

By the middle of the year (Interview 3), it was evident that some students were developing an understanding of disciplinespecific referencing conventions as well as more generally coming to terms with the rhetorical nature of academic writing. On the first point, Fenfang (AE Eco/Com) stated that she felt more confident about using the APA referencing style and indeed in contrast with her first EAP assignment (mentioned above), her second EAP assignment included a correctly set out reference list. Colin (an Engineering student in AE1) commented that he realised that it was not only necessary to use different referencing styles for different disciplines, but that the choice of style needed to be consistent. As has been highlighted in the literature (e.g. Leki, 2007; Pecorari, 2008), awareness of different disciplinary discourse conventions is an important part of students’ academic literacy development. As Prior points out however, enculturation into disciplinary communities is primarily about reading, writing and ‘negotiating trajectories of participation in communities of practice’ (Prior, 1998, p. 32), and not simply about adopting discipline-specific citation protocols. As a number of our students acknowledged, this process of negotiation and participation in disciplinary discourses can manifest itself in different ways.

On the issue of the rhetorical nature of academic writing, several students noted in Interview 3 how they had learnt to adapt their writing to the task. For example, Nhung (AE Eco/Com) talked about the importance of analysing the assignment question first in order to decide which ideas to select, attributing this strategy to the advice provided by his EAP teacher. Judy (an Arts student in AE2) identified the role of task type as an influence on the way she used sources: a factor that has been recognised as a key aspect in L2 students’ academic literacy development (e.g. Plakans & Gebril, 2012).

In addition, a number of students were starting to recognise the dialectical nature of academic knowledge (Bazerman, 1988) and how this was linked to persuasive academic writing. James (AE Eco/Com) explained that he felt he should provide a range of ideas from sources in order to ‘make your writing more persuasive’. Both Kath (AE Eco/Com) and Qing (a Biomedicine student in AE1) highlighted the need to use material that presented contrasting views, while Laura (Arts student in AE2) stated that she wanted ‘to find sources that present different views to my own’. Importantly, the views expressed by these students were reflected in how they actually used sources in their written assignments. Kath’s (AE/Eco & Com) second EAP assignment, for example, contained reference not only to different newspaper articles but also to a blog, all presenting alternative views on government policies. In all these cases, students were clearly becoming more aware of the role sources play in making academic writing persuasive, an issue that has also received considerable attention in the EAP literature (e.g. Leki, 2007; Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011; Tardy, 2005).

By the end of the year (Interview 5), many students were becoming more discriminating and focussed in their use of sources. Alicia (a Built Environment student in AE1), had become aware that the nature of the assignment determined how she approached the research process:

I feel each article that I write is different. depends on the purpose of the assignment and how you are required to meet the requirements.

enfang (AE Eco/Com) was distinguishing between types of sources required for different subjects, for example, for finance you might rely on online materials because you need to talk about the real environment, but for management you need to use academic books for theory.

Alex (also AE Eco/Com) reported that she tried

to work out the relationship between what I learnt and what the assignment try to test me and say which knowledge might be relevant.

Alex was also now differentiating between disciplinary expectations, observing that Commerce subjects were about picking up knowledge, reading and remembering’ and Arts subjects were instead about ‘reading and interpreting’.

It is important to note, however, that a number of students (those from Engineering, Science and Music) reported that they were not required to produce research-based assignments for their disciplinary majors in Semester 2. This lack of researchbased writing in some disciplines of undergraduate study was also apparent in Leki’s (2007) study.

5.3. How do students describe their authoring practices in relation to their use of sources in their research-based writing? Do these practices change over time?

At the beginning of the year (Interview 2) it was clear from students’ interview responses that they felt they were still learning how to be academic writers, rather than authors who possessed the requisite knowledge to write with authority (Clark & Ivani-c, 1997). Kath (AE Eco/Com) for instance, stated that her source texts provided her with learning opportunities:

When I read I try to learn from how other people write.

Judy (an Arts student in AE2) highlighted the authoritative status of academic writers who presented their ideas as ‘factual . in comparison with me’. This reaction is common among students, especially those in their early stages of undergraduate study, as they often feel that they are unable to contribute to the ideas and knowledge bases of their fields of study because they are unable to write with the authority of their source text authors (see Casanave, 2002).

The struggle to establish an academic authorial identity was described by the students in a number of different ways in Interview 2. For Yves (an Eco/Com student in AE2), learning how to use discipline-specific language was critical. Yves spoke of how he wanted to be able to use the specialist language of his sources to show the reader that he could express ideas in an ‘Economics way’. As studies have shown, being able to animate and ventriloquise the words of others in the process of developing a voice of one’s own is a complex, power-related and transformative experience (Ivani-c & Camps, 2001; Kramsch, 2010; Starfield, 2002).

For some of the other students, the focus was on issues surrounding textual ownership. For James (AE Eco/Com), this was related to the difficulty he experienced in establishing a clear connection between his source materials and his own writing:

I can’t fit sources in my essay properly. I use a quote but I can’t connect with my essay. I want to use more of the sources but I can’t make them like my language, so I include less than I research.

Being able to ‘make’ the ideas and words of source texts ‘like my language’ is no easy undertaking for any L2 student (see Currie, 1998; Storch, 2009), but poses an even greater burden on first year L2 undergraduates (Angélil-Carter, 2000; Starfield, 2002).

For both Kelly (a Science student in AE2) and Laura (an Arts student in AE2), becoming an academic author was also abo ownership of ideas:

Sometimes author’s ideas and [my] ideas come together, so it’s not always clear who owns the ideas (Kelly).

Laura spoke of how she regularly talked to her husband about her assignments so that she could work out how to distinguish between her own ideas and those of her source texts. Laura also spoke of being aware that each subject may require different referencing styles and that she needed to adapt to different disciplinary expectations:

I had to change myself to write [for different subjects].

Uncertainty over the ownership of ideas has emerged as a key issue in much of the research into authorship in the literature (e.g. Howard, 1996; Pecorari, 2003; Thompson, 2011). This work emphasises the need for educators to re-consider the concept of original authorship. The authors argue that all texts are multivoiced because each individual writer is part of an ongoing sociohistorical process of textual (re)production. Rather than insisting that students produce ‘original’ work, they suggest that it is more useful for educators to assist students to engage with the concept of authorship in more complex ways so that they can learn to see themselves as part of this cycle of textual (re)construction.

By the middle of the year (Interview 3), students were able to express more clearly what academic authorship meant to them, and some spoke of feeling more in control of their writing. For example, Yves (AE2) described academic authorship in the following way:

Being an academic author means [explaining] things clearly in a proper structure and a proper language use . it’s very different to normal writing because most of the time you are supposed to write academically to explain more complex ideas rather than in your daily life . writing in academic English is much more sophisticated and different.

In terms of control over writing, Kath (AE Eco/Com) commented that she had learned to ‘borrow’ a definition of a particular concept from a source text and then add her own perspective. Kelly (a Science student in AE2) now felt able to organise and summarise her ideas with a reference, as well as being able to change the language of her source texts:

to make it my own sentence but keep the idea the same.

Laura (an Arts student in AE2) also had a number of interesting things to say in Interview 3 about the development of her academic writing. She described how she was now analysing her source texts more critically: ‘You have to evaluate other sides [of an argument].’ As David, one of the EAP teachers in Casanave’s (2002) study of academic literacy practices in higher education, noted: ‘. students in developing their authorial voice . need to be able to evaluate. That puts them in a position that lets them judge the advantages disadvantages, good points weak points. It’s strengthening their voice in a sense’ (p. 70). Laura’s critical engagement with her readings certainly seemed to be helping her to become more confident as writer. She described how she was beginning to see a relationship between her own opinion and the concept of authorship:

Sometimes you don’t know what you think . sometimes you’re more of an author [and] think that your opinion is important enough to be shown... I want to give my side of the story.

Laura, even more than Kath and Kelly described above, seemed to equate authorship with textual control, a point also raised by Clark and Ivani-c (1997, pp. 152–153):

[sometimes] I see my text going exactly the way that I want with that idea [from a source text].

Overall however, Laura’s claims to being an author were still quite tentative:

I don’t think I’m an author yet. I think it’s a process.

When we elicited students’ reflections about their own authoring practices at the end of the year, their responses were quite varied. In several instances students seemed to have developed quite a strong sense of their own authorial presence; in other cases, they still seemed to feel that they had very little authorial input into the texts they had created. Kelly’s reflections on the research-based writing she completed in the first half of the year capture a sense of both of these perspectives. On the one hand, she seemed to feel that she was incorporating her ‘own’ ideas into her writing:

I have to work out what I think first, then find articles to support my ideas.

other hand, she seemed to indicate that she felt she played no authorial role in constructing her texts:

[academic writing] it’s about putting other people’s ideas together; it’s about referencing and that’s it!

Academic authorship for Judy (an Arts student in AE2) lacked the freedom and personal content associated with writing a diary; it was about control (as expressed by other students in Interview 2) and reading the texts of others:

I have to be rigid and strict. It’s not like writing a diary. [you have to] read as much as you can to get ideas.

This was a point echoed by Qing: ‘because I read more I have more ideas’. The use of sources to generate ideas was also one of the key findings in Plakans and Gebril’s study (2012) of undergraduate L2 students’ use of reading material. This corroborates an earlier study by Campbell (1990), which found that L2 university students relied more heavily on the content of their background reading texts, particularly in their introductory paragraphs, than their English speaking counterparts.

In their final interviews, personal investment, confidence in the development and ownership of ideas, as well as critical analysis and copying featured in the following students’ accounts of their authoring practices. Laura (Arts, AE2) for example, seemed to demonstrate a clear sense of personal investment in her writing and talked about the importance of communicating effectively with her reader:

I try to be more direct, to the point, to [get] my reader to a point to say ‘Well, she’s arguing this.’. I feel that I have much stronger views than before that relate to the subjects I’m studying. I have my own opinion now. That has changed. .I would like to impose myself more.

Qing (Biomedicine, AE1) was also gaining confidence in her ability to formulate ideas: ‘I think it first and get some points and use my points to search’, compared with at the beginning of the year when she got an assignment she checked websites first to get ideas, relying on ‘other source rather than trust myself’. Judy (Arts, AE2) said that she felt she was ‘getting better’ at academic writing, and learning that she sometimes had to be willing to change her argument and even her research topic, in order to project a clear authorial voice:

If I can’t find any evidence to support my argument sometimes I have to change my argument or change my topic . in order to fit into the research I have found . I didn’t used to know that it was important to be evidence-based, so it becomes more restrictive . now I have to research first before I develop my argument.

Alex (AE Eco/Com) seemed to be developing her ability to critically analyse her sources, but would resort to copying from these texts at times. She commented that whereas at the start of the year ‘you’re basically describing the info’, she now felt she could analyse the information and

maybe make a judgment about whether it is useful or not and state my point of view although if the text was difficult, she would still copy rather than interpret, she said.

# 6. Conclusion

This paper has examined first year university students’ selection and use of sources, and their authoring practices over a period of two semesters. The focus of the paper has been on the students’ perceptions of their practices. Broadly speaking, we found that whilst there were changes in the ways that students spoke about selecting and incorporating source materials into their own writing, the period of one year was not long enough for students to become confident in this crucial aspect of academic writing.

More specifically, with respect to selection of sources, we found that whilst students continued to use the Internet, they were generally learning to become more focussed in their search strategies over time and were using their University-based search engine to access discipline-specific electronic databases. Students also continued to rely on materials provided by their lecturers, either because they were required to do so or because they deemed such sources reliable. A few students reported that they also used newspapers, journal articles and book chapters, particularly towards the end of the year. Students selected sources that they believed to be authoritative, reliable, easy to understand and relevant. By the end of the year a few students were identifying task and discipline as further criteria influencing their source selections.

In terms of the students’ use of sources, at the start of the year the purpose was largely to support their own opinions. Students also expressed uncertainty over how to use referencing styles appropriately. As the year progressed, some students explained that they were able to evaluate and incorporate sources that represented a broader range of perspectives as well as being able to use specific citation protocols effectively. However, only a few students described a growing, albeit at times tentative, sense of themselves as emergent authors, who had begun to engage more deeply in the process that Prior (1998, p. 32) has described as ‘negotiating trajectories of participation in communities of practice’. There are clearly many factors that can impact on the ways that students select and use sources. In our study, notably it was students such as Judy and Laura, both from Arts and both students who had completed AE2 (the more advanced English language subject we offer), who seemed to be developing a clearer sense of their own authorial voices over the duration of this study.

Being able to construct as opposed to simply display knowledge requires writers to engage deeply and critically with the content of their disciplinary fields. It also requires writers to position themselves as authoritative in relation to the texts they themselves are reading as well as in relation to the anticipated reader of the text that they will produce. Development of such sophisticated levels of academic literacy requires sustained engagement. As in Leki’s (2007) study, we too found that first year students in the majority of disciplines were not required to undertake research-based assignments (apart from in their EAP subjects). For these students (from Engineering, Science, Music, Built Environment and Economics and Commerce), reading was generally limited to textbooks and other prescribed course materials such as lecture notes, with the aim being more about comprehension of reading materials and understanding of key concepts than interpretation and synthesis of sources. This finding supports a recent study of the perceptions of academic staff about the literacy demands of first year tasks, which also found clear differences between the more humanities-oriented and technically-oriented subjects (Moore, Morton, & Price, 2012).

The findings of this study have a number of pedagogical implications. They question the focus of many EAP undergraduate courses, including our own, which favour writing assignments that require students to do independent research. They also raise the larger philosophical question of whether EAP should merely serve the disciplinary agenda, preparing students for the kind of discipline specific tasks they will encounter in their first year of study, or whether EAP should follow a broader set of aims and objectives that relate to students’ overall development as academic writers. Related to this question is the issue of whether EAP should be taught in discipline-specific or generalist subjects. Clearly it is important for EAP practitioners to continue to undertake research that explores students’ textual worlds, including the kinds of writing assignments they undertake from across the disciplines.
