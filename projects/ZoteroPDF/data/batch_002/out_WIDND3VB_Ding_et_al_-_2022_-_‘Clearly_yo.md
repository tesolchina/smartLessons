Challenges

Language teaching associations have very rarely been the subject of academic research and the few publications that do exist tend to focus on uncritically exploring the benefits of association for its members. One promising means of examining the evolving identity and agency of a profession is to closely examine the online discussions that take place among the members of such associations over time. This study explores the debates, discussions, and disagreements of BALEAP members through an examination of a corpus of BALEAP discussion list postings from 1998 to 2021 while also noting who contributes and who does not. The study uses both thematic and discourse analysis of posts and has three aims. The first is to provide a historical overview of the issues and topics that practitioners discuss, their concerns, agreements, and disagreements. The second is to investigate the identity of BALEAP, through a critical reading of recurrent discussions that emerged (and still continue) when The British Association of Lecturers in English for Academic Purposes changed its name to BALEAP' in 2010. The third aim is to explore identity and agency with a focus on the ongoing debates and tensions about the roles of private providers in EAP in the UK and elsewhere. The paper concludes with a discussion of our principal findings in relation to practitioner identity and agency with suggestions as to why and how the interests and concerns of the practitioner deserve more concerted analysis and attention of the whole EAP community.

# 1. Introduction

In this article, we are concerned with tracing the tropes and themes concerning the practitioner i association that are both visible and hidden within the EAP ideational domain - the shared ideas and concepts of the EAP community. The ideational as aframework for exploring the practitioner in ssociation is broader and i certainly more interpretive than the habitual reearch appearing in this and other journals. However, our approach involves trying to capture the positioning, tatus and (non-) representations of the practitioner that extends beyond published works into occuded fora such as associations (BALEAP) and specificaly the BALEAP discussion list that also shapes informs, and represents and reveals practitioners concerns and interests. Our focus here is an examination of the BALEAP discussion list from 1998 to 2021.

We wanted to know: what EAP practitioners talk about (Research Question 1); what these discussions say about their concerns (Research Question 2), and what these discussions say about identity and agency of practitioners in association (Research Question 3).

# 2. How are language teaching associations researched? What are the foci?

The literature on language teaching associations (LTA) is scant even compared to that of the EAP practitioner, and it remains a curiosity as to why this i the case. wo publications, one an edited book (lsheikh et al., 2018) and the other, aspecial edtion of ELT-J (2016), provide the bulk of the research on English Language Teaching Associations (ELTA) alongside Lamb's (2012) study on LTAs and Rimmer and Floyd's (2020) recent study on ELTA and professonalism. Only Ding & Campion (2016) and Ding (2019) regarding critical analyses of the BALEAP fellowship cheme, and Ding & Bruce (2017) and Bruce (2021) focus attention on the roles BALEAP might play in the ideational domain.

Lamb's landmark study of LTAs provides a clear definition of the functions of LTAs that include:

internal-facing functions such as disseminating information about new policy developments, acting as a forum for teachers to share and develop effective practice, and providing in-service training by experts; as well as external-facing functions such as the representation of teachers' views on policy-making bodies (Lamb, 2012:295).

As noted by Paran (2016):

the external advocacy element which is important for subject associations as wellas professional associations is positioned as the last element for LTAs, as an addition to their core activities. (Paran, 2016:128).

Relegated to an almost aferthought, the public outward-facing and ethical-political purposes of LTAs (especially ELTAs) are consistently neglected in the existent literature. This is hardly surprising as organisations such as IATEFL and BALEAP (Ding & Bruce, 2017) have steadfastly refused to engage in advocacy (although others such as TEs0L have done so), and Rimmer and Floyd (2020), in their very small-scale study, sugest that advocacy tended to polarise teachers based on their personal values and experiences (ibid: 134). Reflecting this, the ELTA literature i largely inward facing, focusing on the multifarious benefits of ELTA membership as well as the challenges facing ELTAs. lsheikh et al. (2018) provide an interesting example of this when they state in their introduction that the core of this book is the inward look at the work and impact of TAs' (ibid: xiv) and this orientation is repeated in the ELT-J special edition.

The overarching themes of ELTA research focus on the positive impact of ELTAs on members where: community and belonging (Abatayo, 2018; Motteram, 2016; Paran, 2016): opportunities for networking (Mottram, 2016); developing new ideas and engaging in debates (Lamb, 2012; Paran, 2016); keeping up to date (Mottram, 2016); demonstratig professionalism (Motteram, 2016), and enhancing status al feature as strong motivations to engage with and in associations (Rimmer & Floyd, 2020). Professional development opportunities feature strongly above and in Shamim and Sarwar (2018), Elsheikh and Effiong (2018), and Bicknell and Lo (2018). Professional identit, belonging, instrumental motivations and knowledge-building appear key to association members (Ding & Bruce, 2017). When compared with the claimed benefits of ELTAs in the previous literature, what is surprising is that nine of the 22 chapters in Elsheikh et al. (2018) focus on leadership opportunities and benefits.

Wenger's (1998) theory of communities of practice is used toframe research in some of the publications (cf. Bicknell & Lo, 2018; Elsheikh & Effiong, 2018; Motteram, 2016) and many chapters in Elsheikh et al. (2018) rely on reflection, narrtives, auto-ethnography, anecdotes and/or personal experiences to explore practitioners and associations. In contrast, large-scale data was collected and analysed by Lamb (2012), Smith and Kuchah (2016) and Motteram (2016) through surveys and questionnaires of association members and/or association leaders. Shamim and Sarwar (2018), Elsheikh and Efiong (2018), and Rimmer and Floyd (2020) conducted interviews with small numbers of participants and Rimmer and Floyd (2020) is unique in seeking the views of teachers who are not members of LTAs.

Collctively, this research offers some useful insights into the benefits for practitioners in joining and being active in associations. However, this small body of research is embryonic and, a such, much remains to be explored, especially in EAP. One key domain that requires iestigtion is thics. thics i a key fere f professions nd, throre, ascitios (Sarti aron, 1977/2013). Archer (2000) emphsies th signficance f thcs for profssins as fllows: the yl dein fee of the fessions, thr possession of an ethical standard, is not just a guide to professional conduct but also a moral raison d'etr for the profession itef (ibid: 291). Therefore, it s surprising that thics has not ben  fous f reearch in this aea. Of great significance for our rearch is that none of these studies investigates what association member disuss and specificall how these discussions: indicat practitioners collective and individual gency and identity, reveal dissonance and tensions within an association and reveal the more political and worldy concerns of practitioners. We are also making the case that associations, in this case BALAP, through conferences, discussions, meetings and networks shape the ideational practitioner domain, and form and shape and constrain the practitioner as much as the published scholarship. Underpinning our concens and research in this artice is how ethics infuses practitioners' discussions and shapes ideas about the profession and practices.

# 3. Our research

We have previously argued that EAP practitioners "need to understand the forces, theories, practices and ideologies that shape our work and lives" (Ding & Bruce, 2017, p. 207), and we suggest that this understanding involves both outward- and inward-facing aspects. To further this understanding, the purpose of this study is to explore inward aspects of the disciplinary culture of EAP, which, ccording to Ferguson (1997), is" form of knowledge which is esentily sociological or anthropological (p. 85). To explore a hidden dimension of the practitioner deational domain, we focus on discussions that took place on the BALEAP JISC email discussion list from 1998 to 2001. This reearch is entirely novel within EAP and language teaching associations (LTA) more generall, and we set out to answer these three questions:

Research Question 1 What do practitioners talk about?   
Research Question 2 What do these discussions say about their concerns?   
Research Question 3 What do these discussions say about the identity and agency of practitioners in the association?

# 4. Methodology

The study of the BALEAP discussion list i principally a qualitative study that examined the themes of the messages posted by members of BALEAP on the BALEAP discussion list from its inception in 1998 until March 2021. The wider population of the texts of the study consists of all of the messages that apeared on the list during this time period. The sampling and methodology used to respond to each of the three research questions are outlined as follows.

To respond to RQ1 and RQ2, an overview of the ist was developed by identifying the key themes that were the object of discussion on the ist from its inception until March 2021. To achieve this panoramic overview of the content of the it, the electronic archive of postings tothe list was set to thread view Then, for the years and months of this time period, a chronological spreadsheet index of the subject lines of the discussion threads of postings to the list was created as a basis for identifying and examining the key themes of the discussions that have occurred during the lifetime of the lit. From this index, key themes that were releant to the overall purpose f the research and the research questions were identified and discussed supported by reference to illustrative threads and postings.

Two more specific studies were then carried out to respond to RQ 3; these studies specifically related to two key themes that merged s frequent and rcurring ts wth hih lee fggment in the irt parf th erch. he first relatd the isueof practitioner identity that emerged around the 'naming issue'. Specificall, this study examined discussant views of the name of BALEAP, including recommendations for a name change. Five key threads with 165 messges focusing on this ssu from 2009 to 2012 and again in 2020 were examined irstly by identifying the types of rhetorical move made in the messages (drawing on and expanding the discussion list move schema identified by Bruce, 2010, p. 341). This classficatory work laid the basis fr a close thematic analysis involving constant comparison. In particula, akey focus of this part of the analysis was to consider the identities of BALEAP members that emerge from their postings on the naming ssue. The second detailed study related to the key issues of the outsourcing and privatization of EAP. Specificall, this study investigated practitioner agency within the context of discussions relating to this issue. Outsourcing or privatization was the focus of 19 discussions (threads) that appeared on the BALEAP discussion list from the year 2000-2021. Each thread was treated as a single interactive genre. Practitioners' perceived agency was examined by a single rater analysis of the rhetorical moves adopted by posters to carry out their discussion of the isue raised in each thread that related to the outsourcing and privatization of EAP. Rhetorical moves are defined as a "discoursal or rhetorical unit that performs a coherent communicative function in a written or spoken discourse" (Swales, 2004, pp. 228-9).

# 5. Findings

# 5.1. Overview of the list: themes of $^ { 2 0 + }$ years of discussion

The BALEAP JISC email discussion ist i is current form started in September 1998, and our analysis covers the period from 1998 up to the end of March 2021. Table 1 provides some basic cumulative data on threads and messages during this period. It is worth noting that this list has little interactive discussion, with $7 5 \%$ of threads containing only one message and almost $9 0 \%$ of threads containing three or fewer messages. Although there have been sporadic discussion threads containing up to 47 messages, only $2 \%$ contain more than 10 messages. It should be stressed that this initial analysis does not trace themes across threads.

Fig. 1 shows the number of messages and threads per year and the number of messages posted per year appears to have almost quadrupled during this period. The year 2020 contained an unusually high number of covid-related mesages. Also, increases in threads and messages is uneven with periods of decline alo being noticeable. In addition, the discussion ist opened up to all BALEAP members with institutional membership in 2010 (previously only two BALEAP representatives from each institution could post), but there was not an equivalent increase in messages following this.

Table 1 Overview of threads and messages.   

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2">Period: September 1998 to March 2021</td></tr><tr><td>Number of Threads</td><td>6168</td></tr><tr><td>Number of Messages</td><td>12,268</td></tr><tr><td>Average number of messages.</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Percentage of threads with only 1 message.</td><td>75%</td></tr><tr><td>Percentage of threads with 2 messages</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Percentage of threads with 3 messages</td><td>4.3%</td></tr><tr><td>Percentage of threads with 4 messages</td><td>2.4%</td></tr><tr><td>Percentage of threads with 5 messages</td><td>1.5%</td></tr><tr><td>Percentage of threads with 6 or more messages</td><td>6.8%</td></tr><tr><td>Range of messages</td><td>From 1 to 47 messages</td></tr></table></body></html>

When discussion did take place - within a singl thread - Table 2 shows the range of threads which generated discussion, five of which will be analysed in detail later.

To analyse messages and threads in more detail we selected alternate Novembers e.g. 2000, 2002) as a sample, and Fig. 2 outlines these findings. Alternate Novembers were chosen as they were often the busiest periods on the list providing us with the most messages to analyse which could be classfied as discussion rather than informational or administrative messages that often generate no responses. Two types of threads/mesages dominate the list: nnouncements and requests for help/information. Announcements mainly consisted of information about events ( $6 2 \%$ of all announcements), but they also included job vacancies, external examining, BALEAP business, courses, training, and publications, none of which generated much further discussion. Requests for help were varied and included seeing advice about exams and tes, visa requirements, policies, reviewing programmes, and strategies to persuade senior universty management on various matters. Call for help were much more frequently met with replies. Sharing of unsolicited information, indiscret or private messages, thanks, retirements, and deaths, humour, rritatio, and etiquett reminders also featured. Also of note was mall change in tone, where in early years ther i a sense that participants knew each ther (reulting in a degree of informality), the tone change to a more recent increase in formality with larger numbers and range of active participants.

Participation on the discussion list (se Table 3) provides some interesting data on who participates. The discussion list is very UKcentric (despite the 'global forum' strapline adopted in 2010), with $8 4 \%$ of messages originating from UK universities. The number of UK-based practitioners is undoubtedly higher than this as individual UK members post using.com or.co.uk domain names. Non-UK participation is negligible. Three members of BALEAP (all members of the exec group at one time) contributed $8 . 6 \%$ (1064 messages) of all messages posted in this period.

Taking data from the University of Leeds Language Centre (a large UK-based EAP centre that has ben active in BALEAP since the beginning of the association) as indicative of activity throughout the history of BALEAP, it i clear that senior management dominate posts on the it. This s often to anounce jobs, events and call for extenal examiners ut thy are aso verrepreented in discussions, in comparison to other collagues. Other staff, even those with 15 years or more of service, rarely contribute to the list.

The implications of these findings will be addressed in the discussion section.

# 5.2. The naming debate

Discussions around BALEAP's name and what those working in EAP call themselves isa recurring theme on the List. This theme was chosen for analysis as i speaks clearly tour focus on identity - which is the concer of Research Question 3- loking at who BALEAP thinks it i rather than what practitioners think they do and some of the conflicts and contradictions that emerge from this. From the initial thread view' analysis, BALEAP's name is the specific focus of four threads and intertwined in a further thread around EAP practitioner tites. Across these five threads there were 165 separate messages in total. The longest occurred in 2009 when BALEAP took on charitable status and changed its name from an acronym (British Association of Lecturers in English for Academic Purposes) to the name BALEAP with astrapline the global forum for EAP professionals. These five threads were the focus for this analysis and are summarised in Table 5.

Expanding on the move schema for online postings of statement/justification (Bruce, 2010, p. 341), move analysis of the messages identifies the following moves in the thread leads of: contextualisation, isue; question posed and, in most cases, the initiator's own suggested response. Most of the thread responses incorporate: (dis)agreement with the previous meage; suggestion and a reason for ug. gestion relatin to indvdul situatios. further move in everal mesages was either the provision of some wider context or history or an apology. There are also some messages that follow none or only one of these moves - providing a suggestion with no context or explanation or making a joke or some kind of fatuous comment. For example: Clearly you have nothing beter to do with your time than this .. sd bastard (November 209). However, more interesting when analysing these threads are three key themes relating to the identity and power of: (1) individuals (who participate in the discussion lit; (2) the field of EAP and its practitioners; and (3) BALEAP as both an association and a collective of practitioners..

# 5.2.1. Individual identity

A noticeable feature f the threads is the gender balance among those posting. Although a high proportion of EAP practitioners are women, at least half of the frequent contributors in the earlier threads are men, supporting claims by Mackay (2020) of the continued gender gap in leadership roles in all areas of HE. Pre-2011, accessto the discussion list was gained viaintitutional representatives. This is relevant as an indication and reminder that the voices heard through the discussion list are not only not global but are those of the elite, of those in a position that allowed them to be chosen to rresent. Post-201 asthe discussion lis opened up a wider range of voices is heard, although this took time and can only be clearly seen following the establishment of SIGs and the onset of the Covid pandemic in 2020 - as analysis of the thread from November 2020 attests.

There also appear to be rhetorical diffrences depending on the status of the author within BALEAP itself (see Tables 3-5 for quantitative examples of analysis). As noted earlier, some messages contain an apology alongside a suggestion, for example: Apologies if this sugtio hs ary bn mde, nd if this disssion hs alredy b onudd t.. (Jue 2020). This ove i sually made y those outside the inner circle' of BALEAP, i.e. members or ex-members of the Executive commitee or those with an established reputation in the field via publications. Those more established in the field write more robustly, referencing previous (sometimes occluded) discussions and historical narratives as a means of invoking authority:

As someone who was around (was it 1989? that year of changes??) when we changed the name of SELMOUS to BALEAP, can I add a couple of points to the pot.' (November 2009).

We thought about al these but as various people have said, we greed it was bettr tokeep BALEAP. (June 2020) [Who constitutes 'we' when so few members attend AGMs?]

Apology or self-deprecation is also used as a softener to indicate awareness that the author may be presenting a controversial opinion, but sill remains determined to do so. This type of (non)apology is usually made by those with higher status in the asociation and as part of an argument for maintaining something akin to the status quo. This is noticeable around considerations of whether to naintain the 'B' in BALEAP and the extent to which the association should be/is British':

'Here is a note of expat conservatism to add to the stew.' (November 2009)

'On the going global' side, please don't throw rotten tomatoes at me, but I fel slightly divided, I'm afraid. (June 2014)

The tone and framing of these email, coming from and between individuals with varying degree of power within the profession could be indicative of how inclusive and welcoming BALEAP was at certain periods of its history. Whilst messages asserted that it was: I have always found BALEAP open and inclusive.' they often simultaneously closed down suggestions for greater inclusion:

At the moment BALEAP is primarily an association of instittions. Institutions pay 350 per year, individual 60.00. Do we want to change that? Probably not.' (November 2009).

At times, this closing down was implied through tone' in the email, for example the short and rather combative quote $^ +$ question rame that in essence implies the suggestion made is meaningless and, therefore not worth considering:

'an open access and inclusive BALEAP" Can someone tell me what this means in practice?' (June 2014)

There appears, then, to have been a power ifferential between those with established status in the BALEAP community and those operating more at the periphery, which is played out in the rhetoric and tone of some of the messages and in who (pre-2011) was able and (post 2011) chooses to participate in discussions.

# 5.2.2. Identity of the field of EAP and its practitioners

Discussions around BALEAP's name inevitably involve analysis of the meaning behind each element of the (former) acronym, deconstructing it to re-build, reinvent or retain. onsiderations of the L' reveal much about how EAP practitioners perceive the work they do, their position within the academy and transitions into the profession.

Status isattributed to being a good teacher in contrast to lecturing. The presentation of what we BALAPERS generally do (October 2010) as being different to the teaching work of others in (higher) education serves to create a collective sense of power amongst the EAP community, positioning an expert us against alesskilful them whe it comes to communicating with students, teaching requres a far greater lel of sill than lecturing. (October 2010). However, underneath this powerful teacherly status, there are also hints that titles are lesa choice and more an imposition from institutions that do not see the academic value in the work done by EAP practitioners:

We agreed at the business meting that most of us are not lecturers. In fact, our Universty made a point of making sure we're not 'lecturers and that pattern is being repeated around the country. Lecturers in EAP seem to be increasingly in the minorit in our field. (November 2009)

In fact, an array of tites are provided in these discussions, including: trainer, instructor, tutor (EAP or English language) associate fellow (hourly-paid work); teaching fellow (permanent work); universty teacher; language facilitator. longside these titles, contributors also consider the language used to describe EAP work as: support, development; remedial; provision; enhancement or mediation. However, there is continued disagreement as to whether and which of thee labels are acceptable. One contributor, working for a private provider within a university, comments that although their centre went through a process of de-academisation, this was countered by an increase in professionalisation. That a choice needs to be made between being either a professional teacher or an academic lecturer is often repeated:

If EAP lecturers dont perate s lecturers ecause they don't do rearch, then I can understand why instittions don't want to pay them as lecturers.' (October 2010)

uch of this positioning seems to be based on what many in the discussion list view as our professional roots:

'we teach English language and skill for our students to function in an English-medium academic context. .. we moved into' EAP, w never actually left EFL, for we still do teach English as a foreign language.' (November 2009)

# 5.2.3. A British vision of a global association

These threads offer a recurring suggestion that BALEAP is at a crossroads' and should make a leap into being fully global. This is then countered by fence siting' and uncertainty as to whether it i desirable, needed or practiclly feasible. This speaks both to an internal conflict in BALEAP around it British identit as well as to the more practical barrier of resources being smallr than aspirations. Despite ssertions from some that Anglophone countries can no longer se themselves as the owners of English including EAP' (April 2011), with which the majority agree in principle, there is also a continued Anglo-centric approach to the discusson: if British EAP is to stay healthy', we may as wll stay with British unles the committe are thinking of conducting oerations ofshore. (November 2009).

'British' is also positioned as a marker of quality:

outside the UK we are very likely to find English' teachers who are unqualifid or poorly qualified: they may be qualified as teachers but not of English; they may have a degree in English, but no teacher training/educ coursework.' (April 2011).

In earlier discussions, when a more global stance is taken it is largely to consider those within the iner circle of English-speaking countries:

a view of EAP as anglo-centric would be wildly inaccurate; in many countrie the American form of English, US materials and program/ me structures are used. British EAP teachers sometimes forget that we don't 'own' EAP .. The Jornal of EAP.. publishes article from the US, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and elsewhere as well as from Britain.' (April 2011).

There appears ambivalence on the ls about becoming global'. Although there are voices that continue to push for a more global positioning of BALEAP (and many of their suggestions have ben taken up), the move towards a truly global vision continues to be slow and gradual. ontributors to the icussion sugest that n organstion is needd that i branded as gloal in staey if not yt in reach. (April 2011) and that the strapline - th global forum for EAP professionals - is aspirational' (June 2014). For some members, though, there remains an unwilingnessto lose the B. In 2009 the assrtion was made that the name IS rcognised and it I a brand. (November 2009), yet eleven years later one contribution noted I ind I am dlways having to explain what "BALEAP" means, even to EAP teachers. (June 2020). Assertions that other brand names began as acronyms and are now a real noun (SCUBA, for example) are used to defend this choice but do not reflect on the realit of how this shift occur- via globally wide public recognition - something that BAEAP has yet to achieve.

What these discussions seem to reveal isa tesion between the perceived power in the Britishness of BALEAP, which at times leans towards the colonial (offshore teaching; The removal of British from the former acronym does indeed reflect the (ic) BAEAP's desire to extend it influence beyond thee shore. (April 2011) and the desire to be more inclusive and global. This tension led to a suggested, and ultimately adopted compromise: Perhaps there is an argument for retaining the name but ensuring that BALEAP is reconised for the excellence of what the membership achieves in a developing field both in Britain and intemationally. (November 2009). This compromise created a name that remains opaque. If No one outside EAP knows what t means.

# 6. The outsourcing theme

The issue of outsourcing EAP by allowing the partil or full privatization of EAP units by companies, such as Kaplan, Study Group and INTO, has provoked ongoing discussion over amost 20 years of the BAAP discussion lis. This third part of the project involved a close examintion of message from the archie of th AP dission list that rlaed directly to this isue, wth disussion threads often initiated by members whose units were faced with privatization along with related issues such as zero hours contracts and the employment conditions of such units. Using the previously created chronological index of threads and informed by the overview thematic analysis, this study was undertaken by developing a micro-corpus of allof those messages that relatd directly or indirectly to the outsourcing issue.

Overall, there were 115 messages from the BALEAP discussion is archive relating in some way to the theme of the outsourcing of EAP. The messages were posted on the BALEAP discussion list from February 2000to March 2021. The total number of words in this micro-corpus was 14,971. The longest message posted on the ist relating to this isue was 1056 words, and the shortest messages were one-word comments. The average length of a single posting was approximately 130 words. The messages on the outsourcing/pri atization theme were organised in terms of threads, consisting of a thred led message, which intiated the discussion of a particular issue or point, and follw-up messges, which were responses to the thread lead'. Overall, there were 19 threads that related to the outsourcing/privatization issue over the time period of the sample. The longest thread consisted of 19 messages (including the thread lead). That thread was about zero hours contracts in 2020, and the second longest thread was about the dissolution of the Universt of Hertfordshire EAP unit in 2009 and consisted of 17 messages.

As explained in the methodology section, the 19 threads of the sample were examined in terms of rhetorical moves', defined as a "discoursal or rhetorical unit that performs a coherent communicative function in a written or spoken discourse" (Swales, 2004, pp. 228-9). Five moves were found to occur within whole threads:

1. issue - announcement of information about a pending privatization, restructuring or changes in employment condition resulting from this type of structural change.   
2. context - any type of background information or clarification that relates to the issue or topic of the thread.   
3. request - an appeal for information about the processof privatization in other contexts or the companies involved or how to take some kind of action.   
4. response - information or advice about processes, other institutional experiences or companies involved.   
5. comment - a personal opinion or position relating to aspects of the privatization proces announced in the thread lead or other message in the thread.

Relating to the privatization or outsourcing of EAP over the time span of the BALEAP discussion list, Table 6 following summarises both the particular rhetorical moves identified within the messages of each of the 19 threads and their frequencies.

Most threads begin with the isue' move, which usually involves an announcement of a proposed or pending privatization of the poster's EAP unit, and a request for information about the company or proceses involved from those on the list who have undergone similar experiences, sometimes with the declared purpose of gathering information to oppose the planned change. The initial messages, the thread leads, usull contained the moves of issue (in 17 leads and 'request (in 10 leads). An example of an isue move is.

University X has rceived  proposal from a private collge [name omitted] .. A to set up a new campus to take over the University' Foundation courses and possibly other English language courses.' (December 2002)

The 'request' move follows later in the same thread lead.

We are concerned about this proposal and in order to resist i would like to hear from any other institutions that have experience f this group.' (December 2002)

Typically the request' is a plea for information from members (possibly those working in other centres that have been in asimilar situation) in order to understand the process and implications of an impending privatization. The response move often results in an offer to share information off-list, such as a response to the previously quoted issue and request.

This is the same organisation (Private Company A is the parent co.) which approached University Y a few years back. Please contact me if you'd like to hear about our experience.' (December 2002)

However, the most frequently occurring rhetorical move in the threads i the comment' move, which is variously used to expres: opinion, agreement, concen, condemation, and congratulations (the lattr in the case of two institutions that succeeded in preventing privatizations). The 100 comments were examined in terms of the previously-mentioned five categories. Although this clasification of these comment moves into these five categories is impressionistc they provide some sense f the general direction of the comments within the threads. Approximately $5 0 \%$ of the 'comment' moves expressed some kind of opinion about an announced privatization, and around $3 5 \%$ were expressons of agreement or solidarity with what was expressed in other postings. Smaller groups of comments were expressions of concern or shock $( 1 0 \% )$ and condemnation $( 5 \% )$ . The word limit here precludes the provision of further quoted examples or micro-analysis of the threads, but it was found that occurrences of the five moves was consistent withi all 19 threads of postings on the privatization issue.

In relation to the exercise of agency by BALEAP members in response to the isue of the privatization of EAP centres, the analysis of these postings on the BALEAP List suggests the willingnes of individuals to support olleagues and exchange information (ofen off list, and sometimes to make moral appeals to BALEAP itself in opposition to privatizations. However, the analysis also reveals a practitioner community that i vulnerable to the vagaries of institutional police relating to privatization which are often negotiated and largely afait acompl bfore those affcted become aware of the process and post something on the BALAP discussion list It was apparent that some individuals incertain situations exercised personal agency in their local contexts and actively campaigned against impending privatizations of their units. In two instance, the takeover attempt did not suceed, but not necesarily because of the opposition of EAP staf, as some candidy point out. While there i certainly moral support and expressions of goodwil from list posters in relation to fellow BALEAP members facing the threat of privatization, the only agency exercised is individual agency in the expressions of olidarit from individual members and sometimes information in response to the request move (although it was evident that some of this communication took place ff-list. What i apparent hrough the discussions of this ssue on the list, however, is no evidence of collective agency by the BALEAP community itlf even though the privatization issue has perstd and troubled AP units as long as the existence of the list. It was interesting to note that mention of union involvement in the sample of messages on the outsourcing isue occurre in only eight messages over the whole sample of 115 messages. The relative role of a union and BALEAP as a professional organisation surfaces in the November 2006 thread in the following comment:

This is not only a professional - ie BALAP- issue surely: it's also a union one, insofar as jobs, careers, and conditions are threatened by INTO and other businesses' (November 2006)

The nature of the discussions and the information, support and information-seeking from members on this sue makes evident the lack of any collective policies or positions by BALAP as an organisation on the isue of privatization. Although appeal from members for information and support have occurred over the $^ { 2 0 + }$ year period of the list, there has been no attempt by BALEAP to establish any working group, organisational repository or clearing house where information about the processes f privatization (or outsourcing) the companies involved, ther strategie, policies and failings, (and cruciall, their ffects on the working lives of BAAP members) could have been documented. Given BALEAP's willingnes toset up working groups to addres other isues, this seems to be a lack in supporting the professionalism of members as EAP practitioners.

# 7. Discussion and conclusion

Before embarking on a discussion about our data and the implications we draw from this it is important to foreground our theoretical motivations for undertaking this novel enquiry. In (Ding & Bruce, 2017:207-208) we drew atention to Ferguson's tripartite domains of practitioner knowledge:

Knowledge of disciplinary cultures and values; a form of knowledge which is esentially sociological or anthropological.

Knowledge of the epistemological basis of different disciplines; a form of knowledge which is philosophical in nature.

Knowledge of genre and discourse, which is mainly linguistic in nature. (Ferguson, 1997: 85).

We stressed that the sociological/anthropological domain of knowledge is the least developed within EAP and merits much greater attention than is currently the case. We still hold the view that practitioners need to develop this outward facing dimension of the practitioner knowledge-base but, inspired by Bourdieu, this reflexive and objective socio-analysis of disciplines needs to be tuned inward to the feld of EAP and specifically the field of EAP practitioners. Along with sociology and any other academic feld, EAP is.

a social field like any other, with its distribution of power and its monopolies its struggles and strategies, interests, and profits (Bourdieu, 1975:19).

This, as Bourdieu would have argued, does not mean that EAP can be reduced to a political feld of struggle but by objectifying the social field of EAP we can asses the limits of knowledge claims in the EAP ideational domain and reveal how ideas people and doxa come o dominate EAP. Through this assesment, we can attempt to rectify some of the liitations within the fed. This, in sum, i our motivation for this study and other research we are involved in (cf. Bond & Bruce, 2022; Ding & Evans, 2022).

Firstly, it is important to stress that the dicssion list i a valuable reource for EAP practtioners,pecilly in trms of devloping and sharing expertise and practical knowledge. Requests for help are answered and knowledge i shared. This was especially noticeable in the early months of Covid (in the UK). Community building and sense of belonging are maintained and enhanced through the generosity of the EAP community in sharing and assting. However, the are caveats to this assesmet. The ist is ery UK-centric and reflects the concerns of UK practitioners. It confirms that BALEAP is very far from achieving its aim of being the global forum for EAP and, indeed, there are vestiges of a somewhat colonial attitude at times to. If the data from the Language Centr at the Universit of Leeds is also true or other EAP centres, then it would semthat very many practitioners do not actiely egag in discssions and those Who do are in more senior positions. Equally, it was noticeable how those with relative power, experience and status can (over-) influence interactions and undertake rhetorical strategies that close rather than open debate. Those with status need to be mindful of how they interact and debate with those who are less powerful..

In conducting this research, the trope that emerges from our analysis of the discussion list is Hadley's (2015) aresting phrase of professional disrtculation, through which much of the iteature on the practitioner and this it can be red. Disarticulation rfers to a sense of divorce or disjointedness between an idea(l) of professional identity and practice. Specificall, Moran (2015) ses identity issues emerging as a symptom or expression of threats to individuals and groups (Ding, 2019:66):

[]dentity only becomes an issue when it isin crisis, when something asumed tobe fixed, coherent and stableis displaced by the experience of doubt and uncertainty. (Mercer, 1990, 43).

Evidence of this disarticulation emerges from the naming debate and the interwoven discussions around practitioner roles, recognition, impact, status (of practitioners as well as EAP centres), which reveal doubts, uncertainty, and disagrements about the international status of BAEAP as well as the identity of practitioners. The trope f remedial provision and support ttes to continuing concerns around status which has long been a concern in the practitioner literature (cf Johns, 1981) and has continued with, for example, Ding & Bruce (2017) and Hadley (2015). This continued aporia within the BALEAP community over a quite long period of time is detrimental to the profession as a lack of clear, consensul, and collective identit, especially in terms of academic identity, facilitate idtities (and threfore status and roles being imposed from without and above. These impose identities are unlikely to be to the benefit of practitioners and their students. In addition, the on-going ambiguities and ambivalence around the international or national tatus of BALEAP as well as limited recognition of BALEAP within the higher education community wil restrict the potential outward facing impact and roles of BALEAP. Combined, these factors leadto a blurred collective identity for BALEAP and a community which may appear opaque to newer members or external practitioners and thus prohibit engagement or interest as well as ading to a sense of confusion as what it means or could mean to be an EAP practitioner.

In terms of agency, we look to Archer's notion of corporate agency:.

Its typical powers are capacitie for articulating shared interests, organising for collectie action, generating social movements and exercising corporate influence in decision-making. (Archer, 2000:266).

Corporate agency is where members share its goals and organisation' (ibid: 267). The collective of corporate agency is a step towards social transformation' (ibid). The power of corporate agents resides in the:

very special punch that they pack as far as systematic stability and change are concerned. Only those who are aware of what they want, can articulate it to themselves and others, and have organised in order to obtain it can engage in concerted action to reshape or retain the structural and/or cultural features in question. (ibid: 265).

Bell (2016) revealed that over 60 universties had some relationship with private providers and numbers have continued to grow since then. The list reveals a great deal of individual support for colleagues undergoing privatization, some examples of individual agency to resist privatization, and some moral appeals to BALEAP. However, there is a distinct lack of corporate agency with no collective potion articulated nor any policy on private roviders and no collctive means to resist. It lacks punch in its outward facing role. Privatization of EAP i  blight and an existential threato AP as a discipline, a field and to its practitioners. It threatens not only employment, status, and oportunities for practitioners, it diminishes the educational and academic roles and impact that EAP can and should aspire to. It ris rendering EAP as an avaricious, profit-seeking service without status, recognition and impact and riss an impoverished future for EAP. The EAP community needs to addres this urgently and begin to articulatecollective values as well as developing a clearing house of expertise and experience in combatting privatization.

Our motivation in undertaking this research has been to objectify a part of the social field of EAP to reveal some of the ideas, people and doxa that circulate within the BALEAP community to critically contribute to making suggestions as to how the community might need to evolve. All thre of us are active BALEAP members who have contributed to the community in diverse ways and all three of us hope that our article conributes to the emergence of a clearer collective identity and an assciation that does indeed pack a punch for the benefit of practitioners and students.
