In contrast with most existing corpus technology (CT) studies which focus primarily on general vocabulary and grammar learning, this study investigates the effectiveness of CT in addressing challenges encountered by novice researchers in improving an advanced linguistic skill in EAP writing: using reporting verbs to express rhetorical functions in citations in literature reviews. An eight-week CT training programme featuring a practical framework of the rhetorical functions of citations and utilising the Parallel EAP Corpora was implemented for 50 Chinese postgraduate students who were L2 English users. A mixed-methods approach was adopted. Paired-samples ttests demonstrated statistically significant improvement with medium effect sizes in the frequency and diversity of reporting verb usage in citations, as well as in the complexity of expressing rhetorical functions of citations. These findings were further corroborated by corpusaided descriptive statistical and textual analyses. Questionnaire data and interviews further revealed students’ positive evaluations towards the training informed by the Parallel EAP Corpora, which facilitated participants’ learning in various ways. These findings hold substantial value for EAP pedagogy, indicating that the incorporation of pedagogically sound CT training can significantly improve novice researchers’ development of academic discourse through nuanced citation practices and advanced rhetorical strategies for composing literature reviews.

# 1. Introduction

Citation, or reference to prior research, is considered a defining feature of academic research writing (Hyland, 2002). The practice allows writers to demonstrate their familiarity with existing knowledge in their field(s) and offer justifications for their arguments and research topics (Hyland, 2000). Mastering advanced citation skills is, however, a challenging task for novice research writers, who are also future academics (Kwon et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018; Petri´c, 2007). It is frequently stated that there is inadequate pedagogical support for such novice researchers, including Chinese novice researchers, to overcome the linguistic challenges they face in producing high-quality academic writing with appropriate citations (e.g. Chen & Flowerdew, 2018a; Gao et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2022).

To address such learning needs, this study focuses on the use of reporting verbs and the rhetorical functions of citations, which are crucial linguistic features in literature review writing. Reporting verbs are lexical devices with which we report information cited from prior studies (Hyland, 2002), while rhetorical functions refer to writers’ intentions and discourse purposes in including particular citations (Petri´c, 2007), such as evaluating or synthesising citations. EAP studies have extensively employed corpus-based analysis to investigate the academic writing of novice researchers, consistently highlighting their challenges with the use of reporting verbs (Kwon et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018; Li & Zhang, 2021; Manan & Noor, 2014; Yilmaz & Ozdem¨ Ertürk, 2017) and expressing the rhetorical functions of citations (Aull & Lancaster, 2014; Lee et al., 2018; Petri´c, 2007; Samraj, 2013; Taylor & Goodall, 2019). However, there have been limited empirical studies exploring effective classroom practices to address these issues, and even less work on the use of corpus technology (CT) to help students learn advanced citation skills.

CT is defined as the ‘use and application of technology associated with corpus linguistics and corpora for language learning and teaching’ (Ma et al., 2024, p. 462). Meta-analyses of CT research have confirmed its effectiveness and wide range of applications in language learning (Boulton & Cobb, 2017; Boulton & Vyatkina, 2021; Chen & Flowerdew, 2018b; Lee et al., 2019). For example, Boulton and Cobb (2017) examined 64 separate studies and identified large average effect sizes for both control/experimental ( $\mathbf { \nabla } \cdot d = \mathbf { \nabla }$ 0.95) and pre/post $\hphantom { - } 2 = 1 . 5 0 \hphantom { - }$ ) research designs. It has been noted, however, that the majority of CT studies focus primarily on the learning of general vocabulary and lexico-grammatical features, with a limited number targeting advanced vocabulary and discourse features in research writing (Boulton & Cobb, 2017; Boulton & Vyatkina, 2021).

Therefore, the present study introduced CT to Chinese novice researchers to facilitate their development of advanced citation skills in using reporting verbs and indicating the rhetorical functions of citations in literature reviews in their dissertations. This application of CT was intended not only to equip these researchers with the essential linguistic skills needed for accurate citation but also to offer substantial empirical evidence and pedagogical insights regarding the application of CT in advanced academic writing contexts. Instead of simply introducing corpus tools, effective corpus-based pedagogy requires teacher guidance and scaffolding to help students develop the skills and knowledge necessary for independent and meaningful engagement with corpus data (e.g. O’Keeffe, 2021; Yan & Ma, in press). We designed, implemented and evaluated an 8-week CT training programme, which utilised both expert and student research writing data from the Parallel EAP Corpora (Ma, 2014) and featured a practical framework for understanding the rhetorical functions of citation.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. The CT approach for academic writing

A significant application of CT for English academic writing lies in the design of genre-/corpus-based learning activities through employing corpora of academic writing, often of journal articles, to enhance learners’ advanced disciplinary and genre-based writing skills (Chen & Flowerdew, 2018b). Examples of the learning activities include the learning of lexical and discourse features for criticising prior research (Charles, 2007), appropriate tense and voice choices for methodology sections (Crosthwaite et al., 2019), stance features and move structures for introductions in social sciences (Chang, 2012), and prototypical move structures for discussion writing (Flowerdew, 2015). However, a review of prior studies and meta-analyses found that there were inadequate experimental studies investigating CT’s effectiveness in facilitating novice researchers’ advanced citation skills.

# 2.2. Reporting verbs in citations

Reporting verbs allow writers to explicitly attribute content to another source, effectively synthesise, incorporate, and evaluate sources, and enhance the information load in literature reviews (Hyland, 2002; Kwon et al., 2018; Swales, 2014). Novice researchers often show low frequency and low diversity in their use of reporting verbs, as well as a poor understanding of those verbs’ evaluative dispositions (e.g. Davis, 2013; Kwon et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018; Manan & Noor, 2014; Nesi, 2021; Sun et al., 2022). To facilitate novice researchers’ learning of reporting verbs, Bloch (2009) introduced CT to American novice researchers to help them make appropriate choices of reporting verbs and correct inappropriately used verbs in given sentences. Callies et al. (2016) employed corpora of both experts’ and learners’ academic writing and designed valuable learning activities to raise novice researchers’ awareness of the lexico-grammatical variability of reporting verbs. Inspired by these two studies, Yan and Ma (in press) introduced the Parallel EAP Corpora (see Ma, 2014), which incorporate expert and learner academic writing samples, to undergraduate students in Hong Kong to help them learn the use of reporting verbs in literature review writing. Our prior work revealed students’ positive attitudes towards the lesson design and the use of corpora, and the authors recommended in that work that future experimental research include the collection of novice researchers’ literature review writing samples to examine CT’s effectiveness in improving students’ frequent and diverse use of reporting verbs.

# 2.3. Rhetorical functions of citations

Various typologies for citations have been developed, and as noted by Petri´c (2007), the most influential one is the distinction of integral and non-integral citations by Swales (1990). An integral citation includes the cited author within the sentence, such as ‘Swales (1986), for instance, found that…’ or ‘the distinction introduced by Swales (1990)…’ (Petri´c, 2007, p. 240), while a non-integral citation places the cited author’s name outside of the text, normally within brackets, such as ‘The CPE procedure (Kim, 1985)…’ (Thompson, 2001, p. 105). Thompson (2001, 2005) developed this typology by incorporating the functions of citations, such as the use of non-integral citations to indicate the origins of concepts or terms. Drawing upon the functions in Thompson (2001), Petri´c (2007) focused precisely on the intentions of citations and summarised the rhetorical functions of citations. This approach has influenced many EAP studies to analyse citations in student writing (e.g. Lee et al., 2018; Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011; Petri´c & Harwood, 2013; Sun et al., 2022), particularly in distinguishing between rhetorically simple and complex functions.

The expression of the complex rhetorical functions of citations is positively related to the quality of learners’ research writing (Li &

Zhang, 2021; Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011; Petri´c, 2007, 2012). Both Petri´c (2007) and Lee et al. (2018) have shown that novice researchers tend to describe existing knowledge in citations through the rhetorically simple function attribution, rather than being critical and analytical in transforming and evaluating existing knowledge through using complex rhetorical functions (e.g. evaluation). Li and Zhang (2021) further stressed that Chinese novice researchers, especially Master’s students, need more pedagogical support to properly indicate the complex rhetorical functions of citations in literature review writing.

Based on Petri´c’s work, Sun et al. (2022) proposed categorising rhetorical functions into macro- and micro-levels. For example, the macro-level evaluation includes positive evaluation and negative evaluation, and the macro-level links between sources can be further divided into contrasting sources, generalising existing knowledge, and exemplifying a synthesised and generalised statement. Compared with Petri´c’s framework, this categorisation allows a more precise exploration of citation use for the complex rhetorical purposes of evaluation and links between sources, but Sun et al. did not include the complex aspect of adopting others’ research to support a writer’s own research. This study therefore proposes a revised framework, building upon the macro- and micro-level categorisations by Sun et al. (2022) and integrating the complex rhetorical functions of Petri´c (2007).

To address novice researchers’ learning needs in rhetorical features, CT has been recognised as an effective approach by several researchers (e.g. Charles, 2007; Chen & Flowerdew, 2018a; Cotos et al., 2017; Crosthwaite et al., 2019), who have designed various useful learning activities. Cotos et al. (2017) examined writing samples from novice researchers and adopted a mixed-methods design to investigate their writing progress. Their findings demonstrated a positive influence of CT in developing participants’ move structures in writing introductions. Inspired by this work, the present study investigates CT’s effectiveness in establishing the complex rhetorical functions of citations in literature review writing.

# 2.4. Research aims and questions

This paper presents the design of a CT training programme for Chinese novice researchers who are L2 users of English to learn reporting verbs and rhetorical functions of citations in literature review writing. The intervention focused on novice researchers majoring in MA programmes related to English language teaching (ELT) and used the corpus tool Parallel EAP Corpora, which is specifically designed for ELT practitioners and novice researchers. A mixed-methods study design, which can ‘provide both rigorous quantitative accounts and ecologically valid qualitative analyses’ (Boulton & Vyatkina, 2021, p. 83), was adopted. The research questions guiding the study are summarised below. Through comparing citations deployed in pre- and post-training literature review writing samples, RQ1 examines the diversity and frequency in using reporting verbs, while RQ2 examines the rhetorical functions, especially the complex rhetorical functions. RQ3 discusses students’ attitudes towards the training programme.

a Modifications of the frameworks of Petri´c (2007) and Sun et al. (2022).

1. To what extent can the use of CT improve the frequency and range of Chinese novice researchers’ use of reporting verbs in their citations in literature reviews?   
2. To what extent can the use of CT improve Chinese novice researchers’ complexity in expressing the rhetorical functions of citations in literature reviews?   
3. What are novice researchers’ attitudes towards the use of CT training to enhance their citation skills?

# 3. Revised categorisation for the rhetorical functions of citations

As discussed above, this study built upon the frameworks established by Petri´c (2007) and Sun et al. (2022) and piloted the resulting framework using data from the expert samples of ELT research writing in the Parallel EAP Corpora. As a result, a typology was developed that included 4 macro-level rhetorical functions and 11 micro-level rhetorical functions. This typology is presented in Table 1, along with relevant samples selected from the Parallel EAP Corpora. The four macro-level categories are 1) attribution of information, activity, and findings to existing studies; 2) links between sources; 3) evaluation of sources through evaluative language; and 4) supporting the writer’s own arguments and research designs by reference to sources. While attribution is a relatively simple rhetorical function, the other three more complex functions demonstrate writers’ analytical skills and require effective instruction for novice researchers to learn their use.

The main difference from the typologies of Petri´c (2007) and Sun et al. (2022) is that this study’s framework sets out two further sub-functions of attribution, namely positive findings and negative findings. This is because many ELT studies focus on investigating the effectiveness of various language learning approaches by measuring learning outcomes or analysing students’ perceptions or experiences, which are liable to generate both positive and negative findings. Other citations with no clear signal or a neutral stance can be coded as simple attribution (Sun et al., 2022).

The macro-level rhetorical functions links between sources and evaluation were adopted from Sun et al. (2022). Links between sources includes four sub-functions: 1) synthesising; 2) exemplification, which normally occurs after synthesising; 3) contrasting; and 4) research lines, a newly generated sub-function referring to citations where the cited author has discussed or incorporated results from another source. Evaluation comprises positive evaluation and negative evaluation, the former expressing agreement with and acceptance of the source’s position and the latter expressing a critical attitude towards that position (Sun et al., 2022).

The two functions application and statement of use elaborated by Petri´c (2007) were re-categorised as supporting. Application supports the writer’s arguments, while statement of use supports aspects of the research design, such as the ‘process of selection’ in the example presented in Table 1.

# 4. Methodology

# 4.1. Participants of the CT training

An online CT training programme was developed as part of a self-guided dissertation writing course for Chinese L2 English users in their second and third years of MA research programmes related to ELT at three universities in mainland China. Three-year MA programmes are common for research MA students in mainland China, during which students typically prepare the literature reviews in the first semester of the second year and complete final dissertations in the third year. The training was conducted when year-2 students had completed the initial drafts of literature reviews. A few year-3 students also participated in the programme, noting that they had primarily focused on data collection and analysis in the previous year, rather than on literature reviews. A total of 50 students participated in the course, the majority of whom were female and aged between 22 and 30 years old. They had achieved good scores on the TEM-8 (Test for English Majors), equivalent to an IELTS score of 6.5 or higher. As part of their graduation requirements, they were tasked with writing a thesis of over 20,000 words, including a literature review of approximately 3000 words. Throughout the CT training, as initially agreed and confirmed through subsequent interviews, students’ supervisors provided only general suggestions regarding students’ writing, such as refining research questions or specifying research topics, without offering extensive feedback on students’ language and citation use in their literature reviews. The research intervention did not affect the supervisor’s normal supervision on dissertations. During the two-month programme, the participants’ supervisors primarily focused on guiding data collection for year-2 students and data analysis for year-3 students. After the programme, the supervisors also examined the participants’ literature reviews and offered suggestions if needed.

# 4.2. The Parallel EAP corpora

The Parallel EAP Corpora, developed by Ma (2014), is an open-access corpus resource comprising two corpora of one million words each: one consisting of expert writing and the other of student writing in the field of English language studies and education. Both expert and learner corpora encompassed several subjects within the field of English Language Studies, and in this study, we only used the component of ELT research with around 200,000 words in the expert and learner writing. The expert ELT Research component consisted of published articles sourced from top-tier (Q1) journals. The learner ELT research component comprised undergraduate Honours Projects from a university in Hong Kong, which included a balance of assignments reflecting a range of high, medium, and low grades. The resource offers various basic functionalities common in corpus tools, including keyword search, collocation, and concordancing, and some advanced functions for comparing the search results and viewing sentences, paragraphs, and even the original academic papers. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the unique Section function enables users to specifically select literature reviews within the subject of ELT Research, which aids ELT students to learn effective citation skills for literature review writing.

# 4.3. Programme design

The CT training programme was conducted by the first author and lasted for two months, including one month containing four 3-h CT sessions (Table 2) and one month for students to revise their literature reviews. Each session was conducted twice to accommodate students from different universities with varying schedules, and 32 participants completed all four sessions. During the CT training programme, the instructor guided participants in directly using the Parallel EAP corpora to learn how to use reporting verbs and express rhetorical functions. The specific learning activities were designed with reference to existing genre-/corpus-based learning activities in academic writing (e.g. Callies et al., 2016; Chen & Flowerdew, 2018a; Cotos, 2014; Cotos et al., 2017; Crosthwaite et al., 2019) and prior research that employed both expert and learner data from the Parallel EAP Corpora to enhance learners’ independent knowledge construction and noticing of target items (Yan & Ma, in press). In addition, the literature reviews written by participants, collected two weeks prior to the programme, were also referred to so as to finalise the learning activities to better cater for participants’ existing problems.

Table 2 provides a breakdown of the session content. Each CT session comprised a 2-h online workshop, followed by a 1-h selflearning tutorial. The tutorial reinforced the workshop content through practical exercises and worksheets, allowing participants to solidify their learning and practise using the Parallel EAP corpora. Session 1 covered the basic functions of Parallel EAP Corpora, such as word search to get collocation lists and concordance lines, for learning the use of reporting verbs for citations. Appendix A showcases sample activities for the workshop and tutorial of Session 1. In Workshop 1, participants focused on identifying reporting verbs (e.g., find), while Tutorial 1 provided targeted practice in exploring frequently less employed reporting verbs. Sessions 2–4 targeted the learning of the rhetorical functions of citations. Participants explored features like collocation lists, sentence view, paragraph view, and text view to gain a deeper understanding of the rhetorical functions of citations used for literature reviews. Appendix A further illustrates sample activities for learning the rhetorical function synthesising by utilising collocation list and sentence/paragraph view in Workshop 3 and the follow-up self-learning tutorial.

# 4.4. Data collection

4.4.1. Pre-/post-training corpora of novice researchers’ literature review writing

To answer RQ1 and RQ2, which concern participants’ learning outcomes in the use of reporting verbs and the expression of the rhetorical functions of citations, novice researchers’ literature review drafts completed before and after the CT training programme were collected and compiled into a pre-training and a post-training corpus using AntConc (Anthony, 2023). Due to time constraints and varying degrees of writing progress, only 12 participants among the 32 students who completed the four sessions were able to submit both written drafts. The pre-training corpus and post-training corpus consisted of 35,502 and 39,032 words, respectively.

# 4.4.2. Questionnaire and interviews

To address RQ3, regarding participants’ attitudes towards the CT training, a voluntary questionnaire (Appendix B) containing six questions answered using a six-point Likert scale was distributed to participants at the end of the training asking about their overall perceptions towards the learning outcomes and the programme. Of the 32 participants who completed all four sessions, 30 completed the questionnaire. Cronbach’s $\alpha$ for the questionnaire items was 0.972, indicating high reliability of the instrument. At the end of the questionnaire, an open-ended question was included, inviting participants to comment on the training; this was completed by 25 participants. 14 participants also accepted the invitation to undergo 30-min individual semi-structured interviews (Appendix C) after the training, which comprised several questions regarding participants’ 1) evaluations of the CT training programme and 2) evaluations of the Parallel EAP Corpora.

# 4.5. Data analysis

As illustrated in Table 3, this study employed a mixed-methods approach, utilising five distinct data analysis methods: 1) corpusaided descriptive statistical analysis of reporting verbs and rhetorical functions, 2) paired-samples t-tests of participants’ learning outcomes in using reporting verbs and expressing the rhetorical functions of citations, 3) corpus-aided textual analysis, 4) descriptive statistics of questionnaire items, and 5) thematic analysis of the open-ended survey question and interviews. The application of these methods to address the three research questions is indicated in Table 3.

# 4.5.1. Data analysis for RQ1 and RQ2

The pre- and post-training corpora were coded for further analysis in three steps: 1) identification of citations, 2) identification of reporting verbs, and 3) coding of rhetorical functions. The identification of citations was based on the guidelines given by Charles (2006) and Kwon et al. (2018), where a clearly referenced point was considered a citation. This study adopted an inclusive approach to identifying reference points, encompassing not only the cited author’s name and publication year but also expressions that explicitly link back to the cited researcher. For instance, in the following example illustrated by Charles (2006, p. 314): ‘Sneddon (1965) derived … His results showed that … ’, the phrase ‘His results’ would be counted as a reference point because it directly connects to the cited researcher, ‘Sneddon (1965)’, guiding the reader to the original source. The reporting verbs used for these citations were identified based on Hyland (2002), and the rhetorical functions were coded using the revised framework outlined in Table 1. It should be noted that, as Petri´c (2007) suggests, a single citation can express multiple rhetorical functions, resulting in the total number of rhetorical functions exceeding the total number of citations. The first author and a trained research assistant independently coded the citations, reporting verbs, and rhetorical functions, with agreement levels of $9 7 . 1 \%$ , $9 5 . 6 \%$ , and $8 8 . 3 \%$ , respectively. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion between the coders.

Three methods of data analysis (see Table 3) were adopted in this study to examine participants’ learning outcomes based on the coded literature reviews: 1) corpus-aided descriptive statistics to measure participants’ learning outcomes in terms of frequency counts for the use of reporting verbs and expression of rhetorical functions; 2) paired-samples t-tests to assess the significance and calculate the effect sizes of the impact of the training programme on participants’ citation skills, specifically focusing on their use of reporting verbs and expression of rhetorical functions; and 3) corpus-aided textual analysis using AntConc to provide concrete evidence of improvement in students’ citation skills.

To answer RQ1, two separate paired-samples t-tests were conducted to examine whether the CT training provided resulted in increased 1) frequency and 2) diversity of reporting verbs.

To answer RQ2, paired-samples t-tests were conducted to examine whether the CT training provided resulted in increased expression of the three complex rhetorical functions, 1) links between sources, 2) evaluation, and 3) supporting. As previous studies have noted (e.g. Lee et al., 2018; Petri´c, 2007), compared with the simpler function of attribution, complex rhetorical functions are

Similar to the studies by Lee et al. (2019) and Boulton and Cobb (2017), this study adopted Hedges’ $g$ to measure effect size, since 12 writing samples in each corpus constituted a relatively small sample overall. Unlike Cohen’s $d$ , Hedges’ $g$ is calculated by multiplying the bias correction factor (Hedges & Olkin, 1985), making it more appropriate for small sample sizes (Lee et al., 2019). Similar to Boulton and Cobb (2017), this study adopts the benchmarks suggested by the meta-analysis in Plonsky and Oswald (2014), which utilises the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of effect sizes found in second-language acquisition studies, as indicators for classifying small, medium, and large effects, with values of 0.6, 1.0, and 1.4 respectively.

# 4.5.2. Data analysis for RQ3

To answer RQ3, a descriptive statistical analysis was conducted to quantitatively characterise participants’ responses to questionnaire items, and a thematic analysis was conducted to qualitatively characterise participants’ responses to the open-ended question and the questions posed in their interviews. The two types of qualitative data were coded independently by the first author and a trained research assistant (Yin, 2009). As in Yan and Ma (in press), data from open-ended question responses and interview responses were used as references for each other during the coding process. The two coders subsequently compared their findings and resolved any disagreements.

# 5. Results

As shown in Table 4, a total of 832 citations were detected in the pre-training corpus, resulting in a density of 23.44 citations per thousand words (ptw). In the post-training corpus, 1024 citations were identified, indicating an increased density of 26.23 citations ptw. The citation densities in both corpora are considerably higher than those observed in Petri´c’s (2007) study focusing on Master’s students majoring in gender studies (14.17 citations ptw). This may be because the length of the literature reviews collected by Petri´c (2007) was approximately twice that of the literature reviews collected in the present study, allowing the students in the former group sufficient space to describe and discuss individual citations in greater depth, resulting in a lower density.

A paired-samples t-test (Table 5) showed a relatively small effect size $( g = 0 . 6 3 )$ , significant at the $p < . 0 5$ level $( p = . 0 2 )$ , of the training on novice researchers’ citation densities.

Textual analysis revealed that during the process of independently revising their literature reviews, participants added several citations to support their arguments and rephrased many statements to include appropriate citations so as to enhance the credibility of those arguments and statements. This can be observed in Examples 1 and 2, where the participant added a citation (‘(Sweller et al. 1998)’) and made corresponding revisions to the accompanying statement. This resulted in the increased citation density and length of literature reviews illustrated in Table 4.

# 5.1. Enhanced abilities in using reporting verbs

Table 6 summarises participants’ use of reporting verbs for citations in the pre- and post-training corpora. The number and proportion of citations involving reporting verbs increased from 555 $6 6 . 7 1 \% )$ to 769 $7 5 . 1 0 \%$ ), showing participants’ increased ability of using more reporting verbs to cite previous studies.

The total frequency and standardised frequency of reporting verbs increased from 682 to 987 and from 19.21 to 25.59 ptw, respectively. Both standard frequencies are substantially higher than the 16.34 ptw observed by Kwon et al. (2018) in the work of undergraduate students with lower citation abilities. A paired-samples t-test (Table 7) revealed a significant difference $( t ( 1 1 ) = 4 . 4 8 , p$ $< . 0 0 1 $ ) between the standard frequency of reporting verbs used by participants before training $( \mathbf { M } = 1 8 . 6 6$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 5 . 7 6 ) $ and after training $( \mathrm { M } = 2 6 . 1 6$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 6 . 6 0 $ ). The effect size was 1.20, indicating a medium to large effect. As shown in Tables 6 and in the pre-training corpus, a total of 159 different reporting verbs were identified. This number increased by $4 2 . 1 4 \% - 2 2 6$ in the post-training corpus. A paired-samples t-test (Table 7) revealed a significant difference $( t ( 1 1 ) = 3 . 5 3$ , $p = . 0 2 )$ in the number of different reporting verbs used by participants before training $( \mathbf { M } = 3 3 . 3 3$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 1 3 . 7 5 )$ and after training $( \mathbf { M } = 4 6 . 4 2$ , $\mathbf { S D } = 1 4 . 5 3 )$ . The effect size was 0.95, indicating a medium-sized effect. These results demonstrate that the CT training programme effectively helped participants use reporting verbs with a higher frequency and higher diversity, resulting in an increase in the information transmitted to readers.

The newly used reporting verbs cover a wide range of purposes. For example, verbs such as guide, differentiate (Example 3), and distinguish refer to the procedural aspects of cited authors’ investigations, acknowledge (Example 4) and appraise show a positive attitude towards the material cited, and oppose (Example 5) and challenge illustrate a critical stance or objections with regard to the reported message (Hyland, 2002).

Corpus-aided textual analysis further showed that in the post-training corpus, participants were more skilful than they had previously been in selecting reporting verbs to explicitly express meaning and authorial stance. In the pre-training Example 6, for instance, the participant used the words analyse and report, which transmit information objectively without further interpretation (Hyland, 2002). In the post-training revision, however, these two words were replaced by point out and state (Example 7), both of which signal the participant’s support of and agreement with the cited information.

In summary, these findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the CT training programme in improving the frequency and diversity of participants’ use of reporting verbs and helping them learn the evaluative dispositions associated with this use.

# 5.2. Improved skills in expressing rhetorical functions

A total of 947 rhetorical functions were identified in the 832 citations of the pre-training corpus, with an average of 1.14 rhetorical functions per citation. The post-training corpus included 1248 rhetorical functions identified in the 1024 citations present. An additional paired-samples t-test (Table 8) revealed a significant difference $( t ( 1 1 ) = 4 . 4 0$ , $p < . 0 0 1 $ between the rhetorical functions expressed by per citation before $( \mathbf { M } = 1 . 1 4$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 0 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ and after training $( \mathbf { M } = 1 . 2 4$ , $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 0 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ), with a large effect size of 1.27, showing an enhanced complexity of discourse through the use of citations.

Table 9 presents the frequencies and percentages of the different rhetorical functions of citations in the pre- and post-training corpora. The density and percentage of attribution decreased from 16.17 ptw and $6 8 . 9 9 \%$ of total rhetorical functions to 15.19 ptw and $5 7 . 9 1 \%$ .

Conversely, the results reveal a higher density and percentage of each of the three macro-level complex rhetorical functions in the post-training corpus, including links between sources (from 7.24 ptw and $3 0 . 8 9 \%$ to 11.66 ptw and $4 4 . 4 3 \%$ ), evaluation (from 1.63 ptw and $6 . 9 7 \%$ to 2.82 ptw and $1 1 . 1 3 \%$ ), and supporting (from 1.63 ptw and $6 . 9 7 \%$ to 2.20 ptw and $8 . 4 0 \%$ ). There were also noticeable increases in the density and percentage of all micro-level rhetorical functions under the three complex macro-level functions. The increase in the complex rhetorical functions which featured in participants’ post-training writing demonstrates that the training enhanced their ability to analyse cited information for the purpose of knowledge transformation, helping improve the quality of their literature reviews.

# 5.2.1. The use of attribution for description

Among the micro-level rhetorical functions under attribution, only simple attribution presented an apparent decrease in terms of density and percentage of total functions, declining from 10.82 to 8.86 ptw and $4 6 . 1 5 \% - 3 3 . 7 9 \%$ . As the simplest micro-level function, simple attribution reflects no evaluative disposition on the part of the writer (Example 8). Citations of positive findings and negative findings indeed embed certain dispositions, as shown in Example 9 which discussed the benefits of a teaching process, and Example 10 which pointed out the disadvantage of ‘comprehensible language input’.

sources in the pre- and post-training corpora $( t ( 1 1 ) = 4 . 7 5 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ , with a medium to large effect size of 1.27. This indicates that the CT training effectively enhanced the participants’ analytical ability to discuss the relationships among cited sources.

In addition, there was a significant difference $( t ( 1 1 ) = 2 . 7 0 , p = . 0 0 3 )$ between the participants’ expression of evaluation in the preand post-training corpora, with a medium effect size of 0.94. This indicates that the CT training effectively enhanced the participants’ critical ability to evaluate cited sources.

Lastly, there was also a significant difference $( t ( 1 1 ) = 2 . 7 5$ , $p = . 0 0 9 \mathrm { _ { \it . } }$ ) between the participants’ expression of supporting in the preand post-training corpora, with a medium to small effect size of 0.74.

# 5.2.3. Enhanced ability in synthesising

As Table 9 illustrates, the macro-level links between sources witnessed the largest effect size. Among its micro-level rhetorical functions, synthesising was the most important, increasing from $2 2 . 4 8 \%$ to $2 8 . 5 4 \%$ of all citations (Table 8). A paired-samples t-test revealed a significant increase $( t ( 1 1 ) = 2 . 8 3$ , $p = . 0 0 8 )$ with a medium to small effect size of 0.76. This indicates that through the CT training programme, the participants learned to detect and express existing knowledge in the field by summarising the information provided by multiple citations (Petri´c, 2007; Thompson, 2001). This is evidenced in Examples 11 and 12, where participants added the underlined sentences in post-training revision to synthesise a common issue summarised from a list of cited sources.

11) Wang Chuming (2010) revealed … Wang Chuming and Wang Ming (2015) implemented … Wang Qi and Wang Fenglan (2016) carried out … All previous studies are consistent with the fact that … [post09p15s01-06]

Participants also learned to provide further exemplifications of synthesised statements, making their writing more formal and credible. For instance, while the wording of Example 13 remained the same in the pre- and post-training corpora, in post-training revision, the participant added further elaboration supported by a citation (the underlined sentence), increasing the credibility of the synthesised statement.

# 5.2.4. Increased confidence in evaluation

Evaluation is divided into positive evaluation and negative evaluation. Through participating in the training programme, the participants learned to positively evaluate previous studies to help them justify their adoption of methods or concepts, as seen in Example 14 with the mention of ‘Baddeley’s three component model’ and in Example 15 with the reference to ‘Erin Jame’s econarratology’.

In post-training revision, participants also demonstrated greater confidence in critically assessing previous studies to highlight knowledge gaps. Example 16 illustrates a common pattern seen with this rhetorical function, in which it co-occurs with synthesising to avoid directly criticising a specific study.

16) However, both the research at home and abroad has the following deficiencies. [post12p15s01]

In summary, the CT training programme successfully helped the participants learn and skilfully express the complex rhetorical functions of citations.

# 5.3. Positive evaluations of the CT training programme

Table 11 shows the results of the questionnaire items investigating participants’ attitudes towards the CT training they received, which were completed by 30 participants. All items, judged on a six-point Likert scale, received mean scores of 5.30 or higher, revealing the participants’ positive evaluations of the training. The high mean scores were not surprising, as we also received many informal letters of thanks and acknowledgements from the student participants. Specifically, participants believed that the training showed them how to use the Parallel EAP Corpora and interpret corpus data, enhanced their knowledge of literature review writing, matched their expectations, and was well-organised and worth attending.

Thematic analysis of responses to the open-ended question (O) and the interviews (I) revealed that the participants positively evaluated the CT training as ‘effective’ (O-07, I-14), ‘useful’ (I-06, I-03), ‘helpful’ (O-26, I-06, I-10), and even ‘perfect’ (O-08). Three key themes were identified: 1) the useful functions of the Parallel EAP Corpora, 2) the valuable activities provided by the CT-based pedagogy, and 3) the successful learning of literature review writing skills.

Firstly, similar to the findings of Charles (2018), participants indicated that novice researchers could benefit from various corpus functionalities, including the ‘abundant examples’ provided by the Parallel EAP Corpora (I-03), ‘keyword-search and the function to view original texts’ (I-08), and having ‘collocations clearly shown’ (I-08). The Section function was also appreciated by many participants, as it ‘allows us to search the corpus with specific sections, and greatly help us improve our writing in a more targeted writing style’ (I-01). A feature mentioned by most interviewees was the incorporation of both experts’ and learners’ writing samples. This helps participants to develop a ‘deeper understanding of the issues faced by learners’ (I-05) and ‘find ways to address these issues’ (O-30) by ‘referring to expert writing samples’ (I-05, I-09).

Secondly, participants believed that the pedagogical design of the CT training programme provided ‘sufficient’ (O-06) and ‘valuable’ (O-27) corpus search and analysis activities. They appreciated the ‘clear illustration’ (O-27) of the use of the Parallel EAP Corpora, the ‘detailed explanation’ (O-29) of key concepts, the combination of ‘corpus practise [sic] with learning’ (O-19), the independent corpus search as an opportunity to ‘do something by myself’ (O-25), and the ‘well-organisation [sic] of the workshop’ (O-29), all of which were critical for the effective conducting of the CT workshops. In summary, the learning activities could ‘pave the way for literature review writing’ (I-07) for ELT novice researchers.

Thirdly, due to the useful functions of the Parallel EAP Corpora and the learning activities, the participants considered the CT training programme effective in achieving ‘a good-standard of literature review’ (O-26). They felt that they learned the ‘appropriate usages of reporting verbs in different situations’ (I-10) and the relevant lexico-grammatical features, with I-14 noting, ‘I can choose appropriate tenses of reporting verbs for use, and then choose collocations’. The participants deepened their understanding of the rhetorical functions of citations, as expressed by I-09, who commented that ‘I learned to clearly articulate the relationship between previous research and my own through citations’. Additionally, I-04 noticed a general enhancement of her analytical abilities and cognitive skills, saying that ‘I made improvement in analysing sentences and literatures’.

There were, however, several limitations observed by participants. Both O-11 and O-12 pointed out that some learning tasks were a little difficult, requiring more time and guidance to complete. In addition, I-06 expressed the concern that ‘I learned the knowledge points, but it is still [a] challenge for me to apply them in writing’.

# 6. Discussion

# 6.1. The value of using CT for learning reporting verbs

This research builds upon previous studies (e.g. Bloch, 2009; Callies et al., 2016; Yan & Ma, in press) that have developed effective learning activities using CT to address learners’ difficulties in using reporting verbs. In contrast with previous studies that used purposely designed tests (Bloch, 2009; Yan & Ma, in press), the collection of participants’ literature review writing samples allowed for both quantitative examination of participants’ learning outcomes in using reporting verbs and qualitative investigation of how those participants addressed the real difficulties they faced in their own writing.

The quantitative results of this study showed significant positive outcomes, with medium effect sizes for improving the frequency $( g = 1 . 2 0 )$ and diversity $( g = 0 . 9 5 )$ of participants’ use of reporting verbs. These effect sizes were slightly smaller than the mean effect size of 1.50 found across 71 pre-/post-CT designs in Boulton and Cobb (2017), the majority of which focused on general vocabulary and grammar learning. Among these 71 studies, 19 focused on language for general academic purposes, with a medium mean effect size of 1.14. Given that the present study focused in part on the advanced academic writing skill of using reporting verbs, which is crucial for academic writers to situate their work in a larger disciplinary narrative (Hyland, 2002), the results are particularly encouraging for the application of CT in teaching advanced and complex linguistic skills.

Furthermore, qualitative text analysis revealed that after CT training, participants tended to replace non-evaluative reporting verbs with verbs expressing evaluative dispositions and used various reporting verbs to achieve a wide range of discourse purposes, such as expressing procedural aspects of prior research and critically evaluating cited sources. Therefore, we can confidently conclude that the programme successfully addressed novice researchers’ poor understanding of the evaluative dispositions behind reporting verbs (Sun et al., 2022) and that this study can be used as a reference for future EAP classrooms seeking to use CT-based pedagogical activities to address such issues.

# 6.2. The value of using CT for learning complex rhetorical functions

Our findings reveal that CT-based training effectively improved participants’ abilities in expressing the three macro-level complex rhetorical functions of citations, namely links between sources, evaluation, and supporting. According to previous studies (Petri´c, 2007; Sun et al., 2022), the expression of more complex rhetorical functions is a typical feature of high-scoring theses, as they demonstrate writers’ analytical skills in handling citations (Lee et al., 2018). In quality literature review writing, writers must conduct the processes of knowledge processing and transformation (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1987) through application of the complex rhetorical functions, going beyond the use of attribution, which shows writers’ descriptive skills, does not require advanced rhetorical skills, and serves the purpose of low-level knowledge description rather than high-level knowledge processing and transformation (Lee et al., 2018; Petri´c, 2007; Sun et al., 2022). Therefore, a decline in attribution and increase in the complex rhetorical functions could be expected in the results.

Another important contribution of this study is its expansion of the previously attested value of CT in enhancing general academic writing skills, revealing medium effect sizes for the use of CT in developing more advanced and complex discourse skills, that is, the effective expression of the rhetorical functions of citations regarding links between sources $( g = 1 . 2 7 )$ ), evaluation $\begin{array} { r } { ( g = 0 . 9 4 ) } \end{array}$ , and supporting $( g = 0 . 7 4 )$ ). Meta-analyses (e.g. Boulton & Cobb, 2017; Boulton & Vyatkina, 2021) have shown that prior CT studies have tended to focus on teaching general lexico-grammatical features, while the research base for teaching advanced discourse features in academic writing is limited. Therefore, the successful enhancement in this study of participants’ expression of the three complex rhetorical functions of citations offers more empirical evidence for CT’s effectiveness in the teaching and learning of discourse features in academic writing.

However, the effect size in learning supporting $\begin{array} { r } { ( g = 0 . 7 4 ) . } \end{array}$ ) is lower than others. This is mainly due to the view among the participants that the methodology section is the appropriate place to discuss how previous studies support their own research, rather than the literature review, as expressed by one participant (I-4) in their interview: ‘I thought that I should only mention the methods and theories in Methodology’. Therefore, although the CT training programme effectively enhanced the participants’ ability to express the rhetorical function of supporting, more CT-based pedagogical assistance should be provided to Chinese novice researchers to help them understand and explain how other research supports their statements and research designs in Literature Review and Methodology sections.

The revised framework of rhetorical functions also has practical implications for EAP studies and academic writing classrooms. As indicated by Sun et al. (2022), the clarification of macro- and micro-level functions allows for a more specific examination of students’ citation use. For example, the distinguishing of simple attribution, positive findings, and negative findings under the macro-level attribution highlights the nature of simple attribution as the most straightforward function, which contributes the descriptive element of literature review writing; the micro-level positive evaluation can indicate the approaches to be adopted, while negative evaluation often points to the research gaps to be addressed. In summary, our revised framework offers practical guidance for exploring writers’ citation behaviours and can inform the effective instruction of novice researchers in understanding and expressing the rhetorical functions of citations.

# 6.3. Suggestions for future CT research and pedagogy

The participants’ positive evaluations of the training programme provide further evidence for the successful implementation of CTbased training, as well as pedagogical insights into the design of genre-/corpus-based learning activities, with elements such as the clear demonstration of the Parallel EAP Corpora’s features, abundant independent activities in corpus searches and analysis, and detailed explanation of the key concepts in literature reviews all emerging as important aspects. These results further support the claim that the selection of appropriate corpus tools is crucial in CT training (Crosthwaite & Anthony, 2024), as the Parallel EAP Corpora interface used in this study offers two unique corpus functions. Firstly, the Section function allows users to search different sections of academic articles, which facilitates more targeted learning (Chen & Flowerdew, 2018b). Secondly, the inclusion of learner corpus data can improve learners’ awareness of target items, leading to enhanced learning outcomes (Schmidt, 2010; Yan & Ma, in press). The results therefore encourage the inclusion of more pedagogical corpora with these functions to enhance CT-based pedagogy (Ma, 2024) in academic writing.

This quasi-experimental study, despite a limited sample size, yielded promising results regarding the effectiveness of the CT training programme. Chinese MA students demonstrated significant improvements in both the diversity and frequency of reporting verbs used in citations and enhancements in employing rhetorical functions. Our study demonstrates positive impact of CT on EAP writing development, particularly in the crucial area of dissertation writing. The success encourages further exploration and implementation of similar pedagogical approaches, including the use of Parallel EAP Corpora and the development of comparable pedagogical corpora, to support novice researchers across academic disciplines and levels.

# 7. Conclusion

In contrast to prior CT studies, which largely focus on general vocabulary and grammar learning, this mixed-methods study successfully confirms CT’s effectiveness in enhancing Chinese novice researchers’ advanced citation skills in literature-review writing. The findings demonstrate that participants performed significantly better after CT-based training in using reporting verbs and expressing the rhetorical functions of citations, with a higher frequency and diversity of reporting verbs, clearer expression of meaning in citations, and greater deployment of complex rhetorical functions (e.g. establishing links between cited sources, evaluating citations, and adopting citations to support their research). Moreover, participants positively evaluated their CT training, informed by the Parallel EAP Corpora, which has practical implications for future corpus design and CT training.

This research highlights the multifaceted role of corpora and CT training in language learning. Before beginning a course of instruction, instructors can use corpus-informed insights to identify student needs and difficulties and design targeted pedagogical interventions. After completion of a course, corpus tools such as AntConc can be effectively used to assess student learning outcomes. This cyclical process demonstrates the value of corpus linguistics and methods in informing, implementing, and evaluating EAP pedagogy.

This study is subject to certain limitations, such as a limited number of participants who provided post-training writing samples. In addition, since this study employed a quasi-experimental design with a focus on citation practices, it is likely that participants may have intentionally increased the number of citations in their revised literature reviews. Furthermore, as Chambers (2019) points out, CT training is often led by researchers (including the current project), limiting its practical classroom application for practising teachers. To bridge this gap, future research should develop and implement teacher training programs of using Parallel EAP Corpora to facilitate EAP teachers’ effective citation instruction.
