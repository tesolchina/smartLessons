There has been a prolonged public debate over the health risks associated with coffee consumption, emphasized by three recent articles that consider both the advantages and disadvantages of indulging in coffee and caffeine (“Caffeine in Coffee”, 2012; Poole, Kennedy, Roderick, Fallowfield, Hayes, & Parkes, 2017; Sifferlin, 2015). All three studies have similar views in that as long as coffee is consumed in moderation it has a beneficial impact on health (“Caffeine in Coffee”, 2012; Poole et al., 2017; Sifferlin, 2015).

Whether as a result of myth, conjecture or concrete scientific research, coffee drinkers are subject to repeated warnings over the harm the beverage has with regards to health. Sifferlin (2015) refers to research from TIME that coffee was viewed as  C1 unhealthy a few decades ago and was believed to be connected with heart and cancer problems. “Caffeine in Coffee” (2012) agrees with Sifferlin (2015) that coffee may A1 A2 lead to various heart disorders when too much sugar and cream are added which are high in calories (“Caffeine in Coffee”, 2012). Evidence is additionally provided to show an underlying concern that higher intakes of coffee may increase the risk of low  B1 birthweight, preterm birth or even pregnancy loss for pregnant women (Poole et al., 2017). Caffeine in coffee can also adversely affect women by increasing their risk of fracture if they have inadequate calcium in their diets or suffer from osteoporosis B2

(Poole et al., 2017).

The advantages of drinking coffee are portrayed as equally compelling as the disadvantages. In fact, recent studies support the premise that coffee consumption is associated with a lower death rate (Sifferlin, 2015). “Caffeine in Coffee” (2012) states that without the sweet extras, coffee may in fact produce more benefits than harm. Poole et al. (2017) believe that coffee consumption can even benefit people’s diet with regard to antioxidants more than tea, fruits and vegetables. Coffee will also result in lower risks of health problems connected to the heart, liver, stroke, cancer, and diabetes (Poole et al., 2017). Overall, coffee drinkers face fewer challenges to their health than those who abstain with one major reward being the relationship between coffee consumption and deferred Alzheimer’s disease (“Caffeine in Coffee”, 2012; Poole et al., 2017). The influence of caffeine is so powerful that it even helps those who endure mild cognitive impairment reduce their proneness to dementia (“Caffeine in Coffee”, 2012; Poole et al., 2017). However, there are two main drawbacks of the articles. The studies by Sifferlin (2015) were merely observational and cannot clearly

reflect coffee drinking habits over a length of time. More importantly, in the article entitled “Caffeine in Coffee” (2012), readers are reminded that coffee can postpone aggravation of the Alzheimer’s disease but it is not a cure.

Although all three articles offer well-supported arguments and evidence, they also have some weaknesses. As Poole et al. (2017) note, the existing evidence is mainly observational of different studies with possible bias due to a selective inclusion of certain studies only. They also admit a difficulty in ascertaining the cause and effect, so “randomised controlled trials” are needed to verify and fully understand coffee’s potential to prevent specific health outcomes (Poole et al.,

2017, p. 2). In addition, Poole et al. (2017) present one-sided data as they focus mostly on the positive benefits of coffee and rarely the negatives, only citing risks to pregnancy and chances of fracture for women. For example, they could have highlighted the drawbacks of coffee towards the heart, an aspect that “Caffeine in Coffee” (2012) and Sifferlin (2015) focus on, rather than only the benefits in order to balance the argument. The article titled “Caffeine in Coffee” (2012) cites evidence from a study indicating a relationship between coffee consumption and deferred Alzheimer’s disease but a definitive conclusion on this cannot be drawn given that a number of other confounding factors such as one’s diet might have affected the results of the study.

In conclusion, “Caffeine in Coffee” (2012), Poole et al. (2017) and Sifferlin (2015) state that a cup of coffee is still a controversial drink with several cautions over excessive consumption, but it has notable perks too.
