Virtual conferences and webinars are increasingly transforming the nature of academic communications. In their transition from conventional to digital academic venues, researchers require guided mentorship, hands-on experience, and consistent feedback. In this study, the aim was to explore the effectiveness of an online EAP course in developing researchers' virtual presentation skills. The participants included the researchers $( \Nu = 2 0 )$ from different departments of sciences in a state university in Iran. Through narrative interviews, the needs analysis phase was completed. The findings demonstrated that the researchers' virtual presentation needs are characterized by academic language competence, pragmatic communication skill, and remote audience engagement. To meet these needs, an online short-term EAP course was designed and held. Through participatory observations and peer feedback, the effectiveness of the course was investigated. The results showed the positive contributions of the course. The participants' attitudes towards their immediate learning experiences were further probed through focus-group interviews. The findings highlighted the researchers' revived self-confidence, live demo experience, digital academic competence, multimedia-enhanced presentation skill-building, collaborative community-based learning, awareness of audiences' affective engagement, and increasing attention to communicative language choices in this course. The findings have potential relevance and application to those involved in the design, delivery, and teaching of online EAP courses - and not only for academics from non-English speaking background, but also English-speaking background.

# 1. Introduction

In the digital era of contemporary academic communications, online conferences and webinars provide ubiquitous forums for the researchers to virtually share the latest research findings, promote international research collaborations, and establish scientific networks. To keep up with the growing interests in virtual exchanges of scientific update, researchers are increasingly becoming involved in integrating themselves into international academic communities and attending conferences to showcase their research findings and communicate with other scientists (Englander & Corcoran, 2019). According to Jalongo and Machado (2016), conference participation keeps scholars up-to-date, builds expertise, promotes professional development, creates a research network, enhances productivit, facilitates cllegue menorship, and raes the presenters awareness of ifferent types of audience. Due to its pivotal role in circulating research, foregrounding academic reputation, and establishing interactions between researchers, conference esentation merits further exploration (Perez-Llantada et al., 2011).

Scientific communication is an indispensable academic skill that both early-career and established scientists need to master (Ruiz-Madrid, 2021). In conferences, presenters attempt to represent themselves as competent members of the scientific community (Valeiras-Jurado, 2020). To meet the demands of academic presentations, there is a need for developing meaning-focused commu. nicative competence and ensuring natural interaction efectivenes (Wright et al., 2022). The transition from traditional to virtual presentations could be more daunting for the researchers who need practical guidelines to develop their digital academic competence.

Online conferences are graduall transforming the nature of presenting research findings and interacting with audiences. In this changing environment, researchers are not expected to directly transfer conventional conference norms to the virtual contexts. Research on the spoken discourse of conference presentation is scant (Ferguson, 2013). As Perez-lantada et al. (2011, p. 28) similarly stated, spoken interaction in academic setigs, including conference presentations, deserves a considerably greater weighting in instructional programs'. This research gap becomes more evident in online conferences, where the aim of an oral presentation is not simply transferring information, but encouraging the audiences to react and interact (Connor & Rozycki, 2013). In a recent study, Valeiras-Jurado and Ruiz-Madrid (2019) adressed the three main features of conference presentations: recurrent linguistic features, rhetorical patterns, and multimodal dimensions. Although previous studies investigated the key properties of conventional conference presentations, the salient features of virtual conference presentations, an emerging academic genre, need to be explored. Furthermore, even though written academic discourse has been extensively addressed in the literature, more attention should be paid to the oral discourse of conferences (Xu, 2022) and there is a need for gaining insights into the discourse of virtual conference presentations.

Academic communication plays a crucial role in conference presentations. In this context, language facilitates interactions among professionals in conferences (Ferguson, 2013). The language of conference presentations is more casual than academic writing and the presenters attempt to establish common grounds with audiences (Hood & Forey, 2005). To fulfil efective communication goals in conference restations, knowledge f genre and discursive features is more critical than high-evel proficiency in English Nickerson, 2013). According to Valeiras-Jurado (2020), in conference presentations, the speakers employ persuasive strategies common in academic oral discourse: atention grabbing (atracting and sustaining the audience's interest), emphasis (highlighting salient ponts), evaluation (assessing), processing aids (using resources to facilitate comprehension), context projection (using agreed-upon information), and rapport (establishing sympathy and reciprocal understanding).

Language is a critical dimension of conference presentations. As Fernandez-Polo (2014) mentioned, the current scientific communication is both argumentative and persuasive as scientists establish the value of scientific claims and strengthen personal interactions with audiences. English stands as the lingua franca of research communications (Xu, 2022). According to Webber (2005) the distinctive features of conference presentations that set them apart from research artices include speaker engagement and audience involvement characterized by frequent use of first and second pronouns, reliance on transitions and discourse markers, and use of indefinite quantifiers. Fernandez-Polo (2018) further showed that in conference presentations, personal pronouns facilitate showcasing the presenters' rapport with audiences. Researchers employ second-person pronouns to create a shared interpretation, address audience as recipients, thank the audences, show positive politenes, direct ttention to data, crate dialogue, guide through presentations, and emphasize shared knowledge. By doing so, presenters communicate scientific knowledge, safeguard mutual in. terpretations, attract audiences' attention, and strengthen interpersonal relations. However, researchers lack adequate language knowledge to deliver ffctive English preentations (Barrtt & Liu, 2016) which imposes even more pressures on researchers in virtual presentations.

The purposeful use of pedagogically-oriented didactic materials educates the researchers as competent conference presenters and prepares them for overcoming the challenges of international conference presentations. As Jalongo and Machado (2016) stated, educators need specialized skills and pedagogical repertories to teach the researchers how to present papers at conferences. Building conference presentation competence requires "remedial interventions" (Perez-Llantada et al., 2011, p. 28). As Querol-Julian and Fortanet-Gomez (2019) pinpointe, modelling and joint deconstruction, joint construction, and independent construction represent the thre-stage collaborative and learning-oriented instruction of conference presentation skill. In modelling phase, the focus is on learning how to use common linguistic and non-linguistic resources. The joint deconstruction and construction of genres and dialogic exchanges empower the learners to share experiences and predictions, and develop their critical, creative thinking skill in inter. personal relationships. In independent construction, students engagement in simulation tass raises their awarenes of how to play different roles in academic conferences. In this context, training reearchers to effectively employ discipline-specific evaluative and persuasive strategies and enhancing their awareness of academic presentations and discussions through multimodal and interactive pedagogical resources gain significance.

Since the outbreak of Covid-19, researchers have been attending different international conferences and webinars as participants and moderators. However, in transition from conventional to digital platforms, researchers need to learn how to adapt their oral presentations to the emerging academic communication requirements. Since online conferences and webinars are turning into dominant means of scientific communication, researchers are increasingly using virtual platorms to disseminate reearch findings and receive feedback on in-progres research projects. Therefore, instead of restricting reearchers to one-size-fits-ll website guidelines and YouTube tutorials for online conference presentations, there is a need for providing them with basic principles and hands-on experiences of virtual discipline-specific conference presentations. The aim of this study is threefold: exploring the researchers virtual conference presentation needs, examining the effctivenessof an online EAP course in developing reearchers virtual conference presentation skills and investgating the reearchers attitudes towards their lening experiences in this program. To these ends, the following research questions were addressed:

RQ1. What are researchers' virtual conference presentation needs? RQ2. To what extent does an online EAP course improve the researchers' performance in virtual conference presentations?

RQ3. How do researchers perceive their learning experiences in an online EAP course?

# 2. Method

In this qualitative study, ased on the researchers initial nees analysis the course syllabus was developed to meet the researchers immediat learning needs, build on their strengths, and assst them in addressing their weaknesses. The coure was divided into seven sections: warm-up, introduction, method, results, discusson, conclusion, and question-and-answer to be compatible with the overal structure of online conference presentations. Each section (e.g., introduction) incorporated into the syllabus is broken down into four sub-sections: presenting rhetorical moves at macro-level and highlighting common language problems at micro-level, sharing comments on the researchers live mini-presentations, using tutorials to showcase the functions of digital tool for online audience engagement, and engaging the researchers in making their own presentation podcast series.

First, the move patterns of each section (eg., ntroduction) were briefly presented and a samplevirtual conference presentation in Skyroom (a local laform for holding online classes) forum was critically evaluated to practically examine the rhetorical move pattern (which moves are included and which ones are missing) and move order. Furthermore, at micro-level, the participants were scaffold to learn how to use researcher-assistant toos such as Corpus of contemporary American English (cocA) for finding collocations, comparing key words in context, etc. Common grammatical errors (subject-verb disagreement, unparallel structure, dangling structures, etc.) were also highlighted to raise the researchers' consciousness of micro-level linguistic properties.

Second, for each section, the participant researchers attempted to apply the rhetorical patterns and share their live mini. presentations of that specific section. They received comments from the instructor and colleagues. The researchers either took notes or recorded the discussions to refine their presentations accordingly.

Third, the participants were practically guided to use digital tols to facilitate academic communications with remote audiences. The researchers learned how to use interactive presentation tools such as Slido, Mentimeter, Poll everywhere, etc., and collaboration platforms such as Mindmeister, Miro, Coggle,ec. They were also introduced to cientific inforgraphic-making wesites such as Canva and Visme. By navigating these platforms, the participants reflected on adapting their potentials to virtual presentations.

Fourth, in asynchronous weekly tasks, to boost the researchers confidence and engage them in openly talking about their pre. sentations, the participants recorded short three-to-five-minute audios (presentation podcast series) on the same target section and sent them to the instructor through WhatsApp to receive feedback.

# 2.1. Participants and context

The participants included twenty faculty members from different departments of sciences in one of the state universties in Tehran, Iran. Nine male and eleven female researchers with the average age of 38.7 participated in ths study. Thirten faculty members were assistant professors and seve were associat professors. Wheras the asstant professors worked for an averag of 4.38years n higher education, the associate professors worked for an average of 9.85 years in higher education.

The participants had limited prior experiences of virtual conference presentations. They had the experience of at least one remote conference presetation. In particular, out f twenty participants, twelve faculty members had one virtual conference presentation, six faculty members presented two online conference papers, and only two faculty members delivered three remote presentations.

Upon the faculty members frequent requests for joining a short-term course that professonally prepares them for international virtual conference presentations, the preliminary needs analysis was performed and atraining course in the EAP center of the university was designed. An announcement was then made so that the interested faculty members could voluntarily join the online course. Upon fulfilling the course requirements, they could be awarded a certificate of attendance.

Since the shift from fac-to-face to online presentations was abrupt, the faculty members sought step-by-step mentorship, peer feedback, and live hands-on experiences. To preserve the participants' anonymity, pseudonames will be used hereinafter. In this context, the first author with at least five years of experience in designing AP syllai, producing (digital) EAP materials, and teaching EAP courses in higher education was the course instructor.

# 2.2. Data collection

# 2.2.1. Pre-course narrative interviews

Before the course, narrtive interviews with the potential participants were conducted to explore their previous experiences of online conference presentations, peeptions of thr trengths and weaknese in virtual conference presentations, and expectations of the course. These narrative interviews that functioned as the preliminary needs analysis were done in the researchers native language so as to encourage them to frly share their personal experiences and eallife stories. These oral narratives asted about 30 minutes on average. The researchers were encouraged to send their complementary notes to the instructor if they had any. Four participants sent further notes through WhatsApp.

# 2.2.2. Two-phase observations

Two-phase participatory observations were fllowed: The researchers virtually presented their conference papers once before the course (the first version) and once after the course (the refined version). In accordance with the first-phase results (needs analysis) macro-level structure (rhetorical moves), micro-level language use (lexical-grammatical choice), and online audience engagement were included in the field notes. The results of these two phases were then compared.

# 2.2.3. Peer feedback

In mini-presentations, the researchers were assigned to present a specificsection of their presentation (e.g., introduction). After each mini-presentation, the participants were asked to freely share their specific comments on colleagues presentations either through microphones or the chatbox on Skyroom.

# 2.2.4. Post-course focus-group interviews

In post-course focus-group interviews, the researchers were asked to collctively share their real-life learning experiences of the course. The interviews lasted for 90 minutes on average. The researchers preferred totalk in Persian. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim (see Fig. 1).

# 2.3. Data analysis

The interviews and peer comments were transcribed to gain in-depth insights into researchers real-life experiences and viewpoints. The six phases of recursive thematic analysis (Terr et al, 2017) were taken into account: getting familiarized with the dataset for immersion purposes, identifying the emerging patterns to generate the codes and systematicall attach a meaningful label to the data segments of interest constructing the organizing themes, reviewing probable themes and checking if they worked optimally with the dataset, defining the themes representing the core ideas, and ensuring the cohesion and clarity of data. Data triangulation, thick context description, member checking,coding-recoding practice, and inter-rater rliability were considered to ensure the trustworthiness. The inter-rater reliability was estimated and the discrepancies were resolved. To compare presenters pre-course and post-course performance, chi-square tests were performed.

# 3. Results

# 3.1. Participant researchers' virtual conference presentation needs

In response to RQ1, the participants' perceptions of virtual conference presentation nees were investigated. The findings demonstrated the researchers' experiences from thre perspectives: academic language competence, pragmatic communication skil, and remote audience engagement.

# (i) Academic language competence

The participants acknowledged that the irt salient feature of an online conference presentation rests on briefly communicating the most significant research findings in an easily comprehensible language. By so doing, online audiences could smoothly follow the specialized contents integrated into the rhetorical structure. Dr. Rad, a researcher in Biochemistry, mentioned, "Compared toface-toface presentations, you ned to provide more rticuat nd wellganzed content. Othewse you ose your udience intrest nd enion". This indicates that the genre-based structre of a conference paper plays a more critical role invirtual conferences.Likewise, Dr. Emad, an assistant professor in Microbiology, asserted, In introduction, I made th wrong choic of extensively reviewing the itrature at the expense of failing to ink th research gaps to the statement of purpose". This statement demonstrates that rhetorical moves positively contribute to sharing research findings with audiences in virtual conferences.

Dr. Radan, an associate professor in Pharmacology, further admitted that his inadequate attention to organizing the conclusion led to confusion: \*when my presentation was over, an audience mentioned that she had been seeking how our clinical trial could ole clincians problems. Then, I realized that acrucial dimension of my conclusion was mising". Therefore, to properly guide the remote audiences, researchers should more systematically observe the moves.

At micro level, the researchers raised concerns about inadequate lexical resources while explicating diffrent dimensions of their papers. For instance, Dr. Iman, a denl rearcher, admitted that I o 7.5 in S, t whil reenting I stmble to remember the proper academic terms which interrupts the flow of my talk". Dr. Rezvan, a researcher in Biotechnology research center, further approved it

![](img/34d13a58f8a963185e7945c0f832a2a1142480843c50cc8a95d20e2dc32984c7.jpg)  
Fig. 1. Data collection steps.

Despite my experience of moderating international webinars during the pandemic,I am afraid of running out of academic terms and going blank. I desperately need a database with common words/phrases for giving examples, discussing the findings, counteracting the current arguments, etc.

Researchers need immediate access to spoken academic corpora that provide the phrases/collocations required for orall pre senting different sections.

The participants also referred to the risk of using repetitive words and simple sentence patterns which may leave the audiences bored. For instance, Dr. Rahnama, an Anesthesiology researcher, stated that My nighmare isthat my presentation loos tedious because of repeatedly using simple words". The participants were further aprehensive about the monotonous transmission of findings induced by similar structures/sentence patterns because as Dr. Amiri mentioned, In remote presentations to kee your audience engaged and avoid distactio, d vriet  yor sentence paten. . Thus, the rerchers ned to ain aces to common sentence pattens that could be employed in oral academic discourse.

# (ii) Pragmatic communication skill

The researchers highlighted their dificlties in three pragmatic facts of live presentations: Opening and cloing, critical incidents, and question-and-answer sessions. The participants pressing problems pertain to low confidence in online context-relevant communications with moderators and audiences.

First, the researchers mentioned that in online conference presentations, they need to immediately draw the audiences' attention by setting the context-specific hook and ignitig their interest. Dr. Pouya, a senior researcher in Emergency Medicine, shared a recent story of opening her virtual presentation:

I think ice-breaking is a game changer in online presentations. All you nee is winning the audiences attention and building a friendly context. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, we have been involved in moderating international webinars. This experience helped me figure out that I should open my talk by raising questions or making a flashback to real lab stories.

This indicates that due to the absence of face-to-face interactions and audiences' immediate feedback, in warm-up phase, the resenters should contextualize the study, affectively engage audiences, and make them connected.

The researchers admitted that the presentation closing also requires pragmatic communication skills. For instance, Dr. Samin, doing Neurology fellowship, recommended providing take-home messages. She mentioned, "I intend to creat 5-min video to present take-home messages and show the missions of our rearch center". This demonstrates that reearchers could integrate multimodal features into efficiently sharing their conclusive summaries and take-home messages.

Second, the researchers highlighted the dificulty of using survival language if they confront criticl incidents such as running into technological glitches or geting interrupted by moderators. For instance, Dr. Niaz, a researcher in Biochemistry, said, I dred asking for help when the microphone isnot working or my slides do not emerge". This shows that researchers need to accesscommon phrases required for immediate troubleshooting in online presentations. Therefore, mastering survival language for addressing unexpected issues is an immediate concern.

Third, in online question-and-answer forums, the researchers raised their concerns about two daunting scenarios: question incomprehensibility and response inadequacy. For example, Dr. Razi, a Pharmacologist, shared her recent experience: "An audience posed a question about the medicine used in my experiment I asked him to rephrase the questin thre times. The moderator's hint literly saved me. Such an awkward moment!" This shows that virtual question-and-answer forums are more demanding than presentations because researchers should comprehend the questions in two-way international academic communications.

To save their faces as wellestablished researchers, the presenters are intimidated by going blank in question-and-answer sessions because of insuficient language resource for technical details and academic arguments. Dr. Saber stated, I may lack the words for answering simple questions. To me, it is embarrassing to misunderstand questions or answer them wrongly".

The researcher also highlighted the difficulty of spontaneous technical talk in online presentations because "debating in English over controversial isue i frightening. You need to have high proficiency in English to properl defend your position". This indicates that researchers find the post-presentation question-and-answer/discussion sessions more challenging due to communicatie and linguistic inadequacies.

# (iii) Remote audience engagement

Audience engagement gains more prominence in online presentations. Since eye contact is absent, creating visually appealing slides not only wins the audiences atention, but also links the findings to multimodal sources. Dr. Arsalan said, I put myself in my audiences shoes by designing visuall fascinatin slides and dapting contents to their reearch intres" As the audiences find the slides relevant to immediate research/laboratory concerns, they get cognitively and affectively connected.

Furthermore, the researchers shared their experience-based interests in making their presentations interactive so as to actively involve the participants. For example, Dr. Arad stated,

I believe that one-way traditional presentations may not work miracle in online events. We need audiences' involvement. We cannot transfer face-to-face presentation norms to the virtual contexts and expect a pleasant surprise. We should invite the audiences to act as active contributors than passive listeners. I wonder how to make these happen in online venues.

Researchers welcomed a shift in traditional presentations by using digital tools because in online conferences, researchers could not easily adapt presentations to audiences' feedback.

The researchers further referred to using mini-videos though they lacked the linguistc/multimedia resources for fulflling this goal. In this case, Dr. Arad contended,.

Gone are the days when the researchers presented their static slides. The nature of virtual science communication differs. Video abstracts are becoming a popular trend in journals. I believe one-minute science animations/videos are far more effective than dull Google images for online audiences.

This statement highlights the need for digitalizing not only the presentations, but also EAP materials by using researcher-friendy tools. Therefore, to engage audiences, researchers could practice presenting papers to colleagues, spontaneously speak about their projects, receive feedback on their performance, and employ survival language for interpersonal communications.

Consequentl, to perform effctively in virtual conference presentations, the reearchers need to develop their academic language competence, pragmatic communication skill and online audience engagement. First to build their academic language competence, the researchers are expected to systematicall follow the genre-based rhetorical patterns of remote conference presentations for intelligibly communicating scientific contents at macro-level, and boost lexical resources, add sentence structure variet, and employ spoken academic corpora for properly using language at micro-level. Second, they are required to build pragmatic communication skills by contextualizing presentations in thir immediate academic-profesional live, gaining genuine experiences of spontaneous context-relevant talks, using survival language in critical incidents, and managing question incomprehensibility and response inadequacy. Third, to engage their online audiences, the researchers should make their presentations interactive and purposefuly employ multimedia resources/digital tools.

# 3.2. Participant researchers' performance in virtual presentations

In this section, i response to RQ2 addressing the extent to which an online researcher education course improves the researchers performance in online conference presentations, the observation results of macro-level rhetorical organization, micro-level language use, and audience engagement are reported. The chi-square test showed that the researchers' performance was statisticall significant at micro-level $( \chi 2 = 1 1 2 . 6 6 , d f = 1 , p < . 0 1 )$ (See Table 1).

Furthermore, it was found that researchers differed significantly in using macro-level structure $( \chi 2 = 5 0 . 4 0 , d f = 1 , p < . 0 1 )$ Accordingly, the researchers learned to more systematically develop the macro structure of online presentations (see Table 2).

As shown in Table 3, the results revealed that the researchers' participation in the course positively afected their adaptation of audience engagement skills to virtual environments $( \chi 2 = 3 2 . 8 8 , d f = 1 , p < . 0 1 )$

In comments on colleagues presentations, the participants mainly concentrated on the rhetorical pattern and remote audience engagement. From macro-level perspectives, they addressed the clarity of moves, specificity of moves, and confusion/skipping of moves. The collagues' comments showed the vagueness dominant in the introduction, iscussion, and conclusion of presentations. For example, Dr. Emad mentioned, Clarity talks first i distant academic communications. Statement of the purpose was not straightforward". This statement shows that in remote presentations, the researchers should not leave any confusing part for the audiences. Specificity was another critical point. For instance, Dr. Rastin pinpointed, "Saying that the study provides implications could not give insights. The researcher should have stated how the findings specifically contributed to clinical practices". Remote audiences expect the presenters to make move patterns content-specific. Confusing and skipping the moves were also pinpointed. Dr. Rad asserted, "Interpreting the findings in the resuls section could make th audiences bewildered". This showed the need for raising the researchers awareness of the function and order of moves. Researchers may skip a move. For instance, Dr. Neshat pinpointed, I impatiently waited for recommendations for future research which was obviously missng". Therefore, researchers should met audiences' expectations by including specific moves and observe their order.

In remote audience engagement, the researchers addressed the local scope of studies lengthy presentations, ineficient time management, overcrowding slide, lack of visually appealing slides, and absence of two-way interactions. Dr. Iman stated, The text busy slides are nther dazzling nor comprehensible", which highlights using digital visuals and interaction tols for communicating with audiences.

In summary, the findings demonstrated that joining the online EAP course that amed to develop researchers virtual conference presentation skills improved their micro-linguistic knowledge for resolving structural isues (subject-verb disagreement, dangling structure, run-on sentence, fragmented/improper structures), lexical isues (wrong word choice, improper collocation), and pronunciation isues (inappropriate tres pattern, general word mispronunciation, and technical word mispronunciation). Additionally, the researchers could develop their macro-rhetorical knowledge f observing move patterns i different sections of conference papers. In pragmatic communications, the researchers attempted to more frequently employ multimodal tools and avoid text-dominant presentations, more meaningfully interact with remote audiences, and more transparently use warm-ups and wrap-ups for opening and closing presentations.

# 3.3. Participant researchers' attitudes and experiences

In response to RQ3 that explores the researchers' perceptions of their learning experiences in the online researcher education course, the researchers highlighted their attitudes towards the course from seven perspectives:

(i) Revived self-confidence in virtual presentation

The participants unanimously stated that the experience of presenting conference papers online and reflecting on the critical eedback to refine them positively influenced their confidence. This is reflected in Dr. Farahmand's comments,

It was a win-win for both presenters and observers. I was always dubious if I could share my findings because I had the pre monition that my mediocre presentation may negatively affect my identity. Attending this course changed my attitude because I had the chance to polish my presentation before sharing it with real audiences. My colleagues also observed presentations, critically evaluated them, and learned about the tricks to make a presentation flourish.

This statement represents that the authentic experience of online conference presentations raised the researchers' awareness of their strengths and weakneses. As Dr. Noura further pinpointed, Now that I leaned to organize presentations in English, communicate with rmote udience, and manage question-nd-nswer essons, I cannt wt to pent in the upcoming vir onfernce" This comment shows that researchers transfer their learning experiences to the upcoming conferences/webinars.

Furthermore, since in weekly asignments, the researchers talked about different sections of their presentations in short podcasts, they could gain the confidence in sharing findings in English. Dr. Aralan said, This regular engagement pushed me to reflect onmy topic in English, organize my thoughts in English, and seek proper colocations/terms/transitions". Regarding task design, the researchers addressed three points: micro-tasks, stuation-based scnarios, and virtal simulations: \*Since we have hectic schedules, we prefer mini tasks. ine we ed  prctily use langage n nine confeence, we enjy cenario-as ass. Sic we should practice ntral speaking skills we like virtual simulations". Accordingly, in EAP courses that am to develop researchers' digital academic competence, the nature of tasks might differ, where multimodal tasks such as video mini-presentations and short podcasts are favored.

Finally, before the course, the researchers frequently mentioned that question-and-answer sessions are daunting. However, since in this course, they were introduce to diffrent types of questions and responses, they could predict potential questions and audience expectations. The researchers encountered real question-and-answer scenarios to prepare for critical incidents. Dr. Radan stated, "We presented or papers and the cleges asked questions. This proes motivatd us o gain experiece. Thus, reearchers ned to exprience real-time question-and-answer scenarios to practice communicating with remote audiences and using language resources for coping with different question types and interacting with different audience types.

# (ii) Genuine experiences of live demos

By sharing research findings with real audiences, the researchers gained the field experiences of live presentations. Dr. Arad mentioned that It was like a demo for real online presentations. Intead of merely memorizing the principles, we walked the walk". This indicates that demo presentations resembling online presentations could involve the researchers in introspectively and retrospectively reflect on different dimensions of their presentations. In this regard, Dr. Rahnama said, I asked for the pemssion of my colleagues to record their fedback o refine the presentation". In a friendly learning environment, the researchers could benefi from comments to refine their research without losing reputation.

# (iii) Digital academic competence development

The researchers stated that in this course, they learned how to use academic corpora as reliable asstants for properly using ac. ademic terms/collocations/chunks/transitions. Dr. Emad mentioned, In this course, it was for the first time that we were introduced to COCA tutorias. Since then, I have een using COcA for finding the colocations I need for drafting different sections of my papers". This statement demonstrates that by navigating corpora, the researchers are empowered to analyze and use diffrent sentence patterns word choices, and collocation types. Dr. Amiri similarly said, Manchester phrasebank is a roadmap for researchers. You have acess to common phrases". Thus, the researchers use of academic corpora facilitates selecting recurrent lexical and structural pattrns that could be purposefully contextualized. Dr. Razi further stated, "Participating in this course motivated me to compile my academic word/ phrase notebook It worked miracle because my self-made academic corpus is real life-saver. Therefore,self-constructed academic corpus could raise the researchers' awareness of linguistic patterns and scafold them to properly use language resources.

However, as Dr. Rezvan stated, We wish we had acessto disciplinary corpora to check common words that could be extensively used in our field". Dr. Rad also referred to the absence of video corpora and high-quality online conference presentation samples by stating: TED and Youb vids proide ianeus uic sehe. W wihe hdoms for rtions indiffen fieoh we watch presentations, follow transcrips, and learm basic rules". These statements cl for developing discipline-specific corpora for the researchers and giving them access to video corpora of conference presentations in different fields.

# (iv) Multimedia-enhanced presentation skill-building

In online presentations, for establishing more natural communications with remote audiences, researchers extensively rely on visually enhanced presentations and ensure two-way communications through interactive platforms. As Dr. Amiri contended, In this course, I found isation  i virl ptions. in hgh-ion mge, rel b pte, nd elf-d pmion vides could make a huge diffrence". By employing multimediaresources, audiences meaningfull communicate with presenters and pre sentations. To prepare researchers for virtual presentations, building their competence in using digital resources (e.g., video editing tools, interactive quizzes/oll, infographics/slide-making tool, etc.) for efficient communications with audiences gains signficance. Dr. Samin sad, used iore the professional dsig f my slides. Ever since ttended the course, instd f simpy coping Google images, ! have made my slides more visually appealing".

Researchers further learned that \*instead of being a PowerPoint-servant presenter", they should establish a balance between textual and visual features. Accordingly, the findings demonstrated that online platorms are gradually changing the nature of conference presentations which are no longer text-bound and need to purposefully use multimodal resources.

For the engagement of remote audiences, researchers welcomed the idea of using interactive platforms. Dr. Radan said, \*by using interactive resentation sites such as Mentimeter, Padet, or Slido, as presenters, we leaned to have live polls". Accordingly, virtual conference presentations require diffrent presenter-audience interactions, where real-time feedack through onlie collaboration platforms could facilitate communicating scientific findings beyond linear transmission of contents.

# (v) Collaborative community-based learning

The participants mentioned that the course acted as a fertile learning environment to feel attached to a friendly academic com munity, where they could obsere conference papers and exchange critical comments. This is reflected in Dr. Raha's statement, It was like a small leaning community. I flt attached to this community because what motiated us was the desire to support than the urge to challenge".

Another researcher similarly referred to the growing tendency for presenting her ideas with the collagues in the department:

I used to avoid sharing my findings with the colleagues due to our academic culture that prevents us from sharing our in. progress projects. This course encouraged me to change the attitude. In our department, we began to share our findings in English in presentation clubs. This experience also made us interested in becoming critical than flattering friends.

This statement reveals that peer learning, observation, fedback, and scafolding could gradually prepare the researchers for real. time conference preentations. Furthermore, rearchers support the academic culture that inspire them to become critical friends in a flourishing researcher community.

# (vi) Growing awareness of audiences' affective engagement

In virtual presentations, in the asence of face-to-face interactions, the researchers need to more affctively engage the audiences by using facial expressions through the webcam and showing emotions in reporting their findings. Dr. Neshat said,

Your audiences need to get connected to you as the presenter and interact with your presentation. In remote presentations, emotional engagement is the linking chain. Sometimes under intense tension, we even forget to smile. Creating a friendly atmosphere and a welcoming attitude make the difference.

This demonstrates that in distant presentations, researchers need to link findings to the audiences' emotions and enhance their understanding of contents. Conference openings and closings account for more meaningfull connecing the audiences. Dr. Rezvan said, "seasoned online presenters set the warm-up to engage the audiences. They share a short story, narrat real scenario, or invite the audiencesto ask questions. But novice reearchers directl go to the introduction'. This emotional connection is shown in Dr. Arad's words, "Covid-19 is a pandemic chllnge. How you show your emotio about deathtoll must e diferent from how you show your attitude twards great news about the vaccine". Thus, reearchers should integrat atitudes into communicating cientific findings to effctively engage the audiences.

# (vii) Increasing attention to communicative language choices

Researchers acknowledged that they used to ignore language nuances that could play a decisive role in establishing two-way interpersonal communications. The researchers addressed three critical micro-level linguistc features (structure: pronoun, verb tense, and active/passive voice, transition marker, and pronunciation). Dr. Arsalan admitted,

In academic writing, there is a non-written law: Do not use first-person pronouns or active verbs. We inadvertently transfer academic writing rules to oral presentations. I used to extensively rely on passive voice, but my colleagues' feedback changed my mind. I also learned to frequently use present tense in conclusion.

This statement shows that written academic rules could not be directly transferred to oral academic genres. Additionall, making small changes to the structural patterns could dramatically influence how presenters interact with audiences.

Furthermore, instead of sporadically employing transitions, the researchers began to more systematically use them to guide their audienes through different phas. For instance, Dr. Ian mentioned,  abrt shf frm one toc nther might be confusin for the audiences". Therefore, to help audiences smoothly follow the content, the researchers need to rely on transitions for cohesive presentations.

Pronunciation was the third micro-level feature addressed by the researchers: "Mispronunciation of a technical term may lead to misunderstanding. This becomes more evident in remote Q-&A sessions". Dr. Rastin recommended watching science documentaries, listening to journal podcasts, and shadowing the speakers to improve pronunciation.

At macro-level, researchers mentioned that by participating in this course, they learned how to organize diferent sections of conference papers. efore the course, I had dificuly oganzing th diusson section. But i this corse, we practced how  interpret the findings, how to connect the findings to the literature, and how to add new research lights".

The researchers' comments indicated that before the course they had difficulty organizing the introduction, discussion, and conclusion of their papers. However, in this course, they became familiar with the genre of diffrent sections to organize their presentations.

The results demonstrated that from the researchers' perspective, the online EAP course revived their self-confidence, provided them with hands-on experiences of live demos, developed their digital academic competence, bult their multimedia-enhanced presentation kills failitated their ollaboratie larning, rae their awarenes of audiences affetive engagement, and extended their communicative language choices.

# 4. Discussion

In this study, the researchers' virtual conference presentation needs, virtual presentation performance, and attitudes towards the course were investigated. The findings demonstrated that the researchers academic language competence, pragmatic communication skill and online audience engagement significantly improved as the result of participation in the online EAP course. The results are discussed from six perspectives:

First, the findings demonstrated that in this course, the researchers learned how to prepare their virtual conference papers through the hands-on experiences of sharing their research findings with remote audiences, receiving comments on their performance, and boosting their confidence in delivering their refined presentations. As Perez-Llantada et al. (2011, p. 27) stated, \*working with a welletalished research group and under effctive mentor supervision would indeed quicken the cculturation of young reearchers into academic communication in English'. Furthermore, the findings revealed that delivering demo presentations and receiving feedback made the reearchers aware of observing the rhetorical moves of each section (especially the introduction, discusion, and conclusion), properly using micro-level linguistic patterns, and learning the appropriate pronunciation to avoid international aca demic miscommunications.

Based on their immediate experiences of online presentations, the reearchers further stated that virtual presentations, compared to traditional presentations, reemble nutrient-rich snacks beause reearh stries are narrate as multimodal snippets i an atempt to appealingly communicate the main findings with the audiences. As Ruiz-Madrid (2021) pinpointed, the communicative purpose of academic presentations could be fulfilled by multimodal meaning-making sources.

Since the transition from conventional to virtual presentations is not straightforward and presenters need to be more casual to establish a friendly context for two-way scientific exchanges, there is a need for training presenters. According to Fernandez-Polo (2014), in the competitive scientific communications, reearchers are increasingly expected to convince others to establish the value of their scientific clams. Therefore, the researchers learned to modify presentations for remote oral communications. Accordingly, researcher training courses could be developed to graduall build their digital academic competence and motivate them to educate the future generation of international researchers.

Second, beyond transmission-based performative competence, academic interactional competence should be strengthened (Wright et al., 2022) in conference presenters. This becomes more evident in virtual venues because the researchers should purposefully use digital tools for remote audience engagement due to the diffrent nature of presenter-audience communications, absence of face-to-face interactions for receiving audiences' uptake and feedback, and high tendency for having passive audiences with short attention span. Furthermore, since spontaneous online communications could be demanding for non-native scientists, designing a series of virtual scenarios, simulation vide games, and immersive digital games for reearchers to experience natural interactions with remote audiences in EAP courses could be helpful.

As Valeiras-Jurado (2020) pinpointed, conference presentation as oral academic persuasive genre uses multimodal resources to disseminate findings. The reults similarl showed that the flexility of onine preentations pemits the reearchers to more creatively use digital resources for posing just-in-case questions, running opinion poll, designing visull appealing slides, and making short promotional videos/science animations/infographics. Thus, \*the teachability of multimodal competence .. can lead to a more comprehensive genre-awareness and eventually to an improved communicative event" (Ruiz-Madrid, 2021, p. 3). Therefore, EAP courses preparing the participants for academic presentations need to consistently develop their multimodal communicative competence. Although the researchers benefited from using visual asstants (e.g., Visme and Canva), they were more interested in using visual sources specifically designed for academic/scientific purposes.

Third, this course set arich context for the researchers to build their own corpora by using spoken data such as podcasts and written data such as papers because as Barret and Liu (2016) mentioned, researchers may not have adequate language knowledge to deliver effective academic presentations. The researchers mentioned that by using online corpora in this course, they learned to properly employ lexical bundes and collocations. Although the researchers began to gradually master using different corpora such as COCA by watching tutorials and experientially trying their basic features (e.g, Kwic, collocates, etc.), they called for having access to discipline-specific corpora that could be frequently updated. The participants further acknowledge the ned for more in-depth presentation of researcher-made corpus design, compilation, analysis, annotation, and use. Therefore, to provide researchers with a comprehensive guideline for using corpus linguisics tools and establishing their own corpora, there is a need for systematic data-driven learning instruction, purposeful classroom task design, and practical materials development (Friginal, 2018).

The findings further revealed that researchers' access to online academic repositories and their interest in compiling self-made academic databases could empower them to more accurately use language in their presentations and add variet to sentence patterns. In this course, the participantsatempted to more frequently use transitions as academic signposts to properly guide the audiences. Moreover, using video clips involve the researchers in analyzing the verbal and non-verbal features of ectures (Camiciotoli, 2021). Although gaining aces to conference data due to privacy reasons is challenging (u, 2022), video corpora could provide rich pedagogical materials. Investigating researchers real experiences through their reflective journals could also provide better under. standing of data-driven instruction.

Fourth, the researchers asserted that in online conferences, they need to develop pragmatic competence for opening and closing presentations, dealing with critical incidents, and managing question-and-answer sessons. Therefore, going beyond rehearsed presentations to develop effctive academic interactional competence (Wright et l. 2022) is required. To more cognitively and affectively inolve the a, rhr neo rely ondgtl) ami stytelling, shrt rlifetfic/meal narios, and context-specific puzzle-solving/question-raising. Question-and-answer sessions pose challenges due to their dialogic nature (Xu, 2022), where presenters provide situationally proper responses, persuade the audiences, and manage interpersonal relations (Rowley-Jolivet & Carter-Thomas, 2005). In this course, the researchers became familiar with predicting, understanding, and para phrasing questions, taking positions, justifying responses, and answering questions. However, pragmatic communications skills and effective performance in question-and-answersessions need to be further enhanced in longitudinal course series and in different authentic contexts under EAP mentors' supervision. The EAP centers could also prepare ready-made survival language resources for researchers.

Additionally, Three-Dimensional Virtual Worlds (3Dvws) could be designed for researchers to create their academic avatars and navigate virtual conferences to socialize, introduce themselves, and attract audiences' attention. 3vws underscore "user-created contents alowing user-defined purposes" and permit \*users to navigate and manipulate objects in the virtual environment'. In this context, \*avatars also provide the opportunity for users to develop a virtual identity" (Ghanbarzadeh & Ghapanchi, 2021, p. 312). The virtual worlds empower the researchers to build their confidence and practice academic speaking strategies. 3Dvws contribute to learner satisfaction, positive leaning outcome, learner engagement, self-paced, supervised, intractive, selforganized leaning style, environmental-friendliness, retention, social, professional, and technological skill development, and social and universal connect edness (Ghanbarzadeh & Ghapanchi, 2021). By creating digital fictional worlds, researchers learn to spontaneously use language in different conversational role-playing scenarios as they take academic tours to virtual labs, virtual meetings, virtual field trips, etc.

Fifth, this course acted as a small learning community for establishing friendly communications and sharing papers, receiving feedback, and refining preentations through peer cafolding. To develop digil academic competence, researchers need to havetheir own specific social media, where they record video mini-presentations, and become academic vloggers y sharing real-life conference presentation experiences and video reflections. Creating a global community of intenational researchers sharing genuine experiences could meaningfully involve them in building academic speaking strategies and creating academic networks.

Sixth, the researchers recommended digitalizing materials and task designs to prepare the academicians for effctive performance in virtual academic venues. For instance, the researchers recommended using smartphone applications and asynchronous self-paced courses (EAP moOcs) specifically designed for conference presentations so that in thir hectic schedule, they rely on multimodal micro-contents (e.g., journal podcasts, animation series, short video clips, etc.) and mobile-assted tasks (e.g., app-enhanced minitasks) that adres academic language competence, pragmatic communication kill, and remote audience engagement. Furthermore, the researchers asserted that such apps need to facilitate learning-by-doing experiences and employ EAP mentors to observe the learning process. EAP instructors could also use these apps in their flipped and blended classes/workshops.

Finally, the participants favored using elf-paced tasks that could be designed by content-producing websites (e.g., H5P) or content authoring software (e.g., Storyline and Adobe Captivate). In digitally mediated tasks, tracking reearchers' progressthrough e-portfolios and providing adaptive eedback gain prominence. Acording to Garcia-Sanchez (2022), collaborative tasks ik journal writing positively contribute to communicative mediation and professional knowledge construction.

# 5. Conclusion

The findings demonstrated that online researcher training courses not only improve their digital academic competence, but also positively affect their attitudes. This study provides promising implications for EAP course designers, EAP materials developers, EAP teachers, and EAP teacher educators. Acordingly, EAP course designers need to reflect on how to implement technology-enhanced instructional designs, define needs-based EAP MoOcs, and revitalize traditional linear curriculums. Due to the lack of pedagogical resources in EAP courses, the teachers may be pushed to either produce materials themselves or adapt remotely relate sources to their specific pedagogical goals. This indicates that one-size-fitsall approach could not properly serve EAP teachers' pedagogical and assessment goals. To educate the emerging generation of digital EAP materials developers, professinal training workshops, project based hands-on experiences, financial id, and basic infrastructures are required. To produce micro-tutorials anddigital contents, EAP teachers, content teachers, and educational technologists should systematically cooperate.

EAP teachers that typically rely on conventional teaching methods need to transform their pedagogical approaches to meet online EAP course requirements. EAP teachers, computer-assisted language learning (CALL) teachers, and content teachers could jointly facilitate esson plan, task design, and assessment rubric. Furthermore, educating EAP teachers to purposefull integrat technology into pedagogy and normalize it could be the most urgent concern of EAP teacher education programs. In such programs, the educators should consistently receive the participants' reflective feedback on their learning experiences to met their immediate instructional needs.

Future studies may investigate how flipped EAP courses with asynchronous e-contents and synchronous live performance affct researcher preparation as several seemingly hands-on workshops are mainly principle-based webinars that hardly prepare the re searchers for virtual academic events. CALL EAP teacher education initiatives that aim to develop the teachers technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) could be another ie of inquiry. Future reearchers may addres novice researchers' preparation for virtual poster presentation and experienced researchers preparation for virtual keynote speeches. Other researchers may explore Whether researchers' engagement in digital research storytelling and video mini-talks could improve their academic speaking strategies. Future studies may investigate how producing discipline-specific multimodal corpora for researchers could asist them in mastering micro linguistic features (e.g., collocations, lexical bundles, grammatical patterns, etc.).

The potentials of gamification tools for motivating higher education researchers and faculty members, riggering their sense of competition, and improving their learning outcomes could be also addresed. Examining the efects of virtual reality (VR)-enhanced games and simulation games on developing academic community members' linguistic knowledge and communicative performance could be another area of inquiry. Researchers may further explore whether training EAP teachers tocollctively develop digital minigames in educational game design studios could enhance digital EAP materials development and facilitate the researchers professional

development.
