Korean EFL learner

L2 English learners are often reported to incorporate features of spoken language into their academic writing, blurring the lines between written and spoken genres. However, previous corpusbased studies have predominantly focused on L2 writing, leaving L2 speaking relatively unexplored. It is thus unclear whether learners lack genre awareness - as previously claimed - or if they indeed attempt to differentiate their language across genres, but lack ability to do so. This study explores lexical bundles in academic L2 English in parallel corpora of written and spoken data produced by the same learners, with the same prompts pertaining to argumentation. The findings show that learners employ phrasal/referential bundles, typical of academic prose, significantly more in their essays than in their speeches, where clausal and stance-expressing bundles are more prevalent. Notably, the students were found to employ identical bundles differently in argumentative essays and argumentative speeches produced in response to the same prompts. This finding implies that learners may have a better understanding of how to use formulaic language in both spoken and written genres than previously believed, suggesting that they are aware of genre distinctions, although other factors related to mode (e.g., the cognitive demands of speaking vs. writing) are likely to be involved as well. Furthermore, in comparison with previous findings on L1 bundles, these findings hint at the possibility of argumentative genre conventions unique to L2 learners, in which, broadly, L2 argumentative speech resembles an L1 conversational genre, while L2 argumentative essays seem to navigate a middle path between conversational and academic prose conventions.

# 1. Introduction

Awareness of academic conventions and the abilit tocommunicat effectively through both written and spoken genres are integral elements of higher education. Yet these aspects of communication have not been fuly explored in second language (L2) research on learners' academic production. The existing literature on genre-appropriacy has primaril focused on writte language (e.g, Wette, 2017; Negretti & McGrath, 2018; Kesser, 2021; Jiang, Yu, & Le, 2022), with a notable lck of comparative analyses of academic written and spoken genres produced by the same student cohort. The scarcity of research on L2 English spoken language limits our understanding of the extent to which learners are aware of genre-specific language in academic settings.

To bridge this gap, we examine how learners produce academic language acros spoken and written genres responding to the same prompts. This study is among the very few attempts to explore how the same group of EFL universty students produces argumentative essays and speeches i response to the same prompts. Investigating laners' genre awareness by focusing on the appropriate use of formulaic sequences, the study williluminate learners understanding of these two genres of academic language and document the strategies they employ to enhance their academic production.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Argumentation genres

In academic contexts, the term argument" essentiall refers to a set of claims supported by reasoning, forming a logical basis for a particular viewpoint (Toulmin, Reike, & Janik, 1984). Effctive argumentation involves clearly expressing epistemic and affective stances, which requires students to adely onvey their positions regarding the suject and thir audience ., Jiang & Hyland, 2015; Pessoa, Mitchell & Miller, 2017). In pedagogical terms, argumentation plays acrucial role in assessing and enhancing the academic literacy of novice students, as well as acquainting them with common rhetorical practices in academia (e.g., Jaworska, Krummes, & Ensslin, 2015; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Weigle & Friginal, 2015).

The theoretical view of genre that we adopt in this paper comes from Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL; Halliday & Mathiessen, 2004). SFL views genre as a staged, goal-oriented social process (Martin, 1992), and examines language use for meaning creation and goal achievement within genres. While recognizing that language varies across contexts, SFL is concerned with consistent underlying patterns, as Feez (2002) observed, which structure texts t function effctively in cultual and social setigs. Although agumentation could itself be considered a genre, in this study, we differentiate between argumentative writing and argumentative speaking as distinct genres following the SFL view. This distiction is based on thir iffering social contexts and communicative goal, reflecting how they are adapted to their respective environments and purposes.

Studies grounded in SFL have highlighted a range of obstacles faced by students in argumentative genres, frequently noting that, for novice students, particularly L2 leaners, articulating epistemic and affective stances efectively in academic arguments presents a significant challenge (e.g., Hirvela & Du, 2013; Lancaster, 2014; Pesoa et al., 2017; Wingate, 2012). Several studies have pinpointed the origins of such difficulties. For example, Schleppegrell(2006) observed deviations from genre conventions regarding essay structure and failure to communicate a clear stance due to missing modality features and consequential connections. Lancaster (2014) found inappropriate lexical choices that conveyed undue personal involvement and lack of lexical diversity, which indicated limited understanding of the topic. Wingate (2012) noted a lack f textual cohesivenes that made it ifficult to follow the logical structure Such challeng can be partl atributed to the fact that 2 novice tdents are till deeloping their mastry of the recognized genres of academic communication (Tardy, 2009).

Several corpus-based studies have focused on linguistic features of the argumentative essay genre in L2 writing. Taguchi, Crawford and Wetzel's (2013) study revealed that higher-rated L2 argumentative essays ofte feature more complex noun phrase modifications, hinting at astylistic resemblance to the compressed style of research articles (Biber, Gray, & Poonpon, 2011). In a diffrent vein, Weigle and Friginal (2015) compared both native and non-nativeagumentative essays gainst corpus of successul student academic writing. Their findings highlighted notable diference, particularly in the use of \*involved and narratie academic discourse and "argumentation," which points to the importance of managing syntactic features like verb categories and complement clauses. This perspective contrasts with Taguchi et al's (2013) focus on phrasal-level complexity as a defining characteristic of argumentative prose. Such divergences underline that the defining features of argument gnre remain an "underresearched area" in the fied (Pessoa t al., 2017, p. 42).

More often than not, existing research on students argumentation has focused on writing rather than speaking. Yet, particularly in EFL environment, both argumentatie speeches and argumentative essays are common tasks required of novice academic students e. g., Charles, 2007; Jiang, 2015), and are intrinsic features of academic foreign language programs (e.g, Jaworska et al., 2015). Despite their prevalence at the university level (Miller, Mitchell, & Pessoa, 2016), there is a notable gap in research regarding how English language learners produce arguments in both spoken and written genres.

# 2.2. Lexical bundles used by L2 learners

One type f formulaic language sequence that has atracted some research attention is lexical bundles (LBs), which are simply any recurrent combination of a given number of words (often three or four). Data-driven studies that have used corpora and concordancing software to identify frequent Ls have shown that thir distribution indeed differs across types of texts ., Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad, & Finegan, 1999). For instance, studies have compared LB usage of different populations f writers in different types of ac. ademic prose, sugesting that specific bundles are characteristic of highly rated student writing or professional writing (e.g, Appel, 2022; DeCock & Granger, 2021; Li, Franken, & Wu, 2020; Lu & Deng, 2019; Shin, 2019, 2020; Wright, 2019). Given the ubiquity of certain LBs in certain kinds of writing, the use of the expected LBs contributes to discourse coherence, efective communication, and reader aceptance of the writer as a member of a particular academic discipline (e.g., Farhang-Ju, Jalilifar, & Keshavarz, 2024; Kim & Kessler, 2022; Li et al., 2020; Northbrook, Allen, & Conklin, 2022; Wright, 2019).

In this context, prior corpus-based studies comparing the characteristics of first language (L1) academic prose and L1 conversation suggest that the former i more structurally compressed than the later (e.g., Appel, 2022; Biber, Conrad, & Cortes, 2004; Biber et al., 2011; Pan, Reppen, & Biber, 2016). These studies have documented that the structural compreson of academic prose istypically accomplished through the use of nominalization and phrasal modification, while the less compressed language of face-to-face talk is more elaborated, which llows for more subordinate clauses such as verb complements and adverbials. An explanation offeed for this difference is that writig, as a planned, revised, and edited process,contrasts with the sontanty of conversation (eg., Shin, 2018a); moreover, academic writing is guided by discourse conventions demanding it to be both detailed and concise (Staples & Reppen, 2016). Several studies have explored LBs as an index of L2 writing development, often drawing comparisons with native speakers of English (e.g., Chen & Baker, 2010; Dahunsi & Ewata, 2022; Paquot, 2017; Adel & Erman, 2012). A study by Bychkovska and Lee (2017), for instance, investigated the use of bundles in argumentative essays by undergraduates. The study found that L2-English writers tended to use verb phrase (clausal) bundles integrating main clauses, which are, in L1 production, more common in spoken than in written genres. Meanwhile, their L1-English counterparts mostly used the noun phrase (NP)- and prepositional phrase (PP)-based phraal bundes typical of academic proe. In addition, when 2 writers did use phrasal bundes in their essays, their usage differed from that of L1 writers, particularly in including informal expressions.

Furthermore, qualitative analyses examining broader contexts by reviewing concordance lines with lexical bundles have shed light on the discourse functions these bundle flfill across various genres. Among the few studies that have targeted both spoken and written genres, Biber et al. (2004) analyzed the frequency of lexical bundles used for stance, discourse organizing, and referential purposes in L1 faceto-face conversation and academic prose. Their findings indicated a higher frequency of stance and discourse-organizing bundles in conversation, as opposed to a greater revalence of referential bundes in written texs. This functional variation in bundle usage highlights the distinct applications of formulaic language and its specific purpose in speech versus writing.

An increasing number of studies have explored the characteristics of L2 writers' lexical bundle use in comparison to L1 writers. For instance, Chen and Baker (2010) compared L1 and L2 academic writing, finding that L2 writers heavily relied on certain expressions rarely used by L1 writers meanwhile, expressions used frequently by the L1 writers (both students and published authors) were used infrequently by the L2 students. Specifically, they found that L1 students often used mitigating language, such as hedging, while L2 learners tended to neglect the nuances offered by such devices and to overstate their arguments. Chen and Baker further claimed that the L2 learners writing was typicall overly wordy and elaborate, but also pointed out that higher proficiency L2 learners eventually acquired mastery over the strategies favored by L1 writers, including hedging. In another study, however, Shin (2019) found that both L1 and L2 novice academic writer (i.e., university freshmen) failed to use the textual functions of LBs characteristic of proficient academic writing, suggesting that competence in English academic writing conventions must be intentionally acquired by both native and non-native speakers.

Overall, the majority of relevant studies to date suggest that universty-level L2 learners have a higher tendency to use spoken expressios in their academic writing, compared to their 1 peer or professional witers ., Daunsi  Ewata, 2022; Perez-Llantda 2014; Adel & Erman, 2012). According to Leedham (2015), for example, learners are likely to use spoken language features across genres due to "a lack of suficient discrimination betwen different communication purposes" (p. 32). However, most corpus-based research has consistentl focused on L2 writig, with L2 speaking receiving les attention, partly due to the challenges in collecting and transcribing large amounts of spoken data (Granger, 2021). Consequently, our understanding of learners' ability to distinguish between spoken and written academic genres, and to adapt their anguage use accordingly, is stil limited. This gap is particularly crucial for understanding L2 leaners use of genre-specific language and for pedagogical purposes. Given the carcity of intructional materials for academic speech compared to the plethora of resources for academic writing, new findings on this topic could be invaluable in providing meaningful insights and developing targeted pedagogic materials for EAP courses.

To address the existing gap in research, this study systematically compiled corpora of both spoken and written data from L2 learners, allproduced by the same group of students. It specifically focuses on argumentative spoken and writen genres of L2 bundle usage. In addtio, the study discuse its findings alongside those from previous rearch on1 spoken and written genres, specifically the work of Biber and his olleagues, treating the L1 findings as a baseline. Our approach of using both internal comparison (betwen L2 argumentative spoken and written genres in the current study) and external comparison (between the current study's L2 findings and previous L1 findings) offers meaningful insights into whether and to what extent the leaners in this study conform to, or depart from, conventional patterns of spoken and written LB usage.

# 3. The study

The current study explores the use of two genres of academic English, argumentative esays and argumentative speeches, produced by Korean university students learning English as a foreign language. To do so, it employs paralle corpora, specificlly designed for this research, comprising essays and speeches produced by the same individuals on identical topics.

The study firs identifies the LBs in the two corpora, and then analyzes their structural and functional categories, comparing the findings across the two genres. The findings are then discussed together with the findings from previous research targeting L1 spoken and written genres as a baseline. This external comparison will explore whether the Korean students in this study use each of the structural and functional types of bundles in ways that either align with or diverge from established patterns of LB usage. Such comparisons willallow us to paint a detaled picture of how these learners use academic English in both spoken and written argumentative genres. To this end, the following three research questions are posed:

1. What are the most frequently occurring four-word lexical bundes in the argumentative essays and speeches produced by the same group of students?   
2. Do the LBs identified in the essays and the speeches differ with respect to LB structural types?   
3. Do the LBs identified in the essays and the speeches differ with respect to LB functional types?

# 4. Method

# 4.1. Data collection

# 4.1.1. Procedures for administering the speaking and writing tests

The study established comparable corpora, consisting of data from argumentative speeches and essays. These were produced by Korean universty students twice year, from the first semester of 2020 through the first semester of 2023. Each test-taker tok a face to-face oral test and a paper-based written tes. Both the oral and written test components required the tet-taker to produce argumentation in an academic genre by responding to a prompt. The same sets of questions were used in each testing round, allowing for control over topic efects within the same semantic domains, which refers to specific types of contexts (e.g., Cortes & Hardy, 2013). Considering semantic domains is crucial for understanding how lexical bundles are tailored to various academic contexts. In this study, the semantic domains include topics such as technology, education, and the impact of Covid-19. By adopting this approach, we controlled for topic ffects that could potentially nfluence the usage of bundes in the two corpora. In adition, to avoid a prearation effect, half of the students took the speaking tet first and the writing test second, while the other half took the tests in the opposite order.

The prompts covered academic matters such as critique or analysis of recent isues. An example question is Some students learn best from reifeck h  wi fr s, sc  th or . t fin t eic oi forms such as ChtGT, to rive feack nther eys. In yor onin whch f thee w feack methods is more ffetive in improving your academic writing skils? The argumentative genre was chosen because previous research has demonstrated higher levels of syntactic complexity in argumentative essays than in other genres, and because argumentative essays are a basic academic genre (e.g., Shin, 2018a). For the writing test, students were given $5 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ to compose an argumentative essay on a given topic, with no access to outside sources. In the speaking test, two instructors administered the test to each student individually, giving the test-taker about $2 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ to deliver an argumentative speech in response to the test question.

# 4.1.2. Data transcription

The spoken and wrten data were prepared for upload to a concordance program, AntConc (Anthony, 2023). Handwritten essays were transcribed into text files, while the recorded speech videos went through two procedures. First, the audio was transcribed using Whisper (released by OpenAI in September 2022), a spech recognition system that converts spoken content into text. These transcripts were then manuall reviewed and any spellig or typing errors were corrected. Next, each speech and essay was saved as an individual text file. The two files (one speech and one essay) produced by the same student were indicated by the filename, which included an anonymous participant number (e.g., a corpus data filename S1 202306_0001 represents Type of test [Spech/Essay] Topic number, Test date, and Student number). Any personal data that could identify the participants, such as names, were removed. As shown in Table 1, the spoken corpus (SC) and the written corpus (WC) each contain 212 text, of 782.1 words on average, amounting to 333,621 words.

# 4.2. Data analysis

# 4.2.1. Identification of lexical bundles

Lexical bundles were identified in the two corpora using AntConc. Biber et al. (1999) established a criterion of a four-word expression occurring at least 10 times per million words (pmw) to be classified as a lexical bundle. For the present study, a more conservative pproach was adopted. Thefrequency threshold was se t 10 times in the SC, which contains over 200,000 words, and 5 times in the wC, which contains approximately 100,000 words. A range threshold was also set, such that a lexical bundle must appear in a minimum ofsix different texts in the SC, and three in the WC. In addition, two kinds of LBs were removed from the final datasets: any exact quotes from the esay prompts, and overlapping four-word sequences from the same longer sequence. In the case of overlapping bundles, we checked for these manually Following procedures outlined in previous literature (e.g., Chen & Baker, 2016; Shin, 2019), we retained one instance of each unique bundle, and then selected the most frequent of those that occurred within the same longer sequence. For instance, Alplaform is more and I think Alform are overlapping bundes from the longer sequence I think AI platform is more. The former occurs more frequently (10 times in the SC corpus) than the later and was therefore chosen for the analysis. Using frequency as a criterion prioritizes bundes that appear more consistently. The es frequently occurring of the over. lapping bundles were excluded because they inflat the number of bundes and fail t rflect the leaners use of language efectively (Chen & Baker, 2016).

# 1.2.2. Structural and functional analysis of lexical bundles

Two types of analysis were conducted using the LBs that had been identified in the two corpora as the data. The first analysis focused on the LBs' grammatical structure, and the second analysis focused on the LBs' discourse functions. Both of these analyses mployed previously stablishd taxonomies for LBs i argmentatie prose (e., Biber et al., 199; Biber et al., 2004; Staples, gert, Biber, & McClair, 2013).

The grammatical structure analysis first grouped the identified LBs into two main types. One main category is clausal LBs, which are based on verb phrases (VP) such as have a lot of. The other main category is phrasal LBs, which begin with either a noun phrase (NP) or a prepositional phrase (PP). The irst word, a noun, in NP-based LBs, can be followed by prepositional phrases or postmodifier phrases, whole or fragmentary, as in the range of courses and students who have used. In contrast, the PP-based Bs have reposition as the initial word, and a noun phrase fragment makes up the rest of the LB, such as in the case of. For the second analysis, the LBs functions in context w cri s ste resson. nk we should) ore zr  onh thr hd);  ree esion (e.g., there are so many). LBs that had more than one such function were categorized acording to their most frequent function in the data, in line with the methods of prior stdies (e.g., Biber e al., 2004; Chen & Baker, 2016). The functions of al bundles were manually categorized across several lines of concordance, sometimes extending the analysis beyond a paragraph to accurately determine their functions in context It was observed that bundles typically exhibited one predominant function rather than multiple functions. On all occasions where a bundle did have multiple functions, the functions were within the same main function category (i.e., stance. discourse organizing, or referential), and one of the functions was clearly predominant. For instance, the bundle onthe other hand had two common functions, topic introduction and topic clarification, which both fall under the broader main function of discourse organizer, and the bundle overwhelming skewed toward the topic introduction function.

# 5. Findings

# 5.1. Identification of lexical bundles

This section presents the lexical bundles identified in the argumentative essays and speeches produced by the L1-Korean EFL students. Table 2 provides the types and frequencies of LBs in each corpus (SC: 183 types, WC: 126 types) after overlapping and prompt-based bundles were removed. Of the 183 types of LB in the spoken corpus, 160 occurre i that corpus only of the 126 types in the written corpus, 103occurred in that corpus only. Twenty-three LBs were found in both corpora; these "shared LBs" made up $1 2 . 6 \%$ (23/183) of all LB types in the spoken corpus, and $1 6 . 9 \%$ (23/126) of all LB types in the written corpus. In Table 2, the shared LBs are in bold.

In earlier studies, such as those by Biber e al. (2004) and onrad and Biber (2005), 1 bundle in spoken and written genres showed little overlap, indicating distinct, gnre-specific bundle usage, particularly at the extremes of the pectrum, with conversation at one end and academic prose at the other. I contrast, our study identifies 23 bundle common to both argumentative essays and speeches as shown in Table 3. The presence of these shared bundles i somewhat expected, considering the identical authorship and topics. Out of these shared bundles, 15 are clausal, a type typically associated with spoken language. The rest are either noun phrase $( n = 3 )$ or prepositional phrase $( n = 5$ based. These bundles resemble previously identified academic bundles in structure, yet the specific bundle types significantly differ from those typically sen in academic prose. Examples of these unique leaner bundles' include for a long time, f prt-tm work, and s olle stdet. onxl analyis, hower, shws diffent usgf th ame undes in eh gre. As in the examples below (1-4), the bundles are frequently used with postmodification, anticipatory i-clauses, and passive voice in essas, ligning with academic prose standards (.., Biber e l., 999 Pan et al., 2016). In contrast speches tend to mploy the same bundles as subject or in active voice (e.g., Shin, 2019, 2020). While these patterns indicate a student tendency toward spoken lan. guage features within the bundle structures (with $6 5 \%$ of the shared bundles being clausal), they also suggest that students adapt the bundles to essays and speeches in distinct ways.

# 5.2.  Structural analysis of lexical bundles

Fig. 1 presents the structural distribution of the LBs identified in each corpus. As shown in the figure, the proportions of the three main categories diffr in the spoken and written corpora, although the ranks are the same: VP-based bundles are the most common, followed by NP-based and then PP-based bundles. Notably, VP-based bundles are far more frequent in the SC (142 types; $7 7 \%$ of all LBs in the SC) than in the WC (53 types; $4 0 \%$ of all LBs in the WC). Meanwhile, phrasal bundles, comprising both NP-based and PP-based bundles, occur much less frequently in the SC ( $2 3 \mathrm { N P }$ types, 15 PP types; together about $2 0 \%$ ) and much more frequently in the WC (38 NP types, 33 PP types; $6 0 \%$

This pattern contrasts with the findings from prior research on L1 conversation and academic prose, which underscore a clear divergence between spoken and written genres. In L1 contexts, about $9 0 \%$ of the bundles in conversation are clausal, compared to roughly $7 0 \%$ in academic prose, which are mostly NP- and/or P-based (Biber et al., 2004; Conrad & Biber, 2005). Drawing paralls, the L2 argumentative speeches seem to align more closely with conversational structures in containing primarily clausal bundes, similar to L1 conversation. On the other hand, the L2 argumentative essays exhibit a divergent trend. With approximately $5 0 \%$ of their bundles being phrasal, these essays align somewhat with the structure of academic prose, which generall features about $7 0 \%$ phrasal bundles. However, the significant presence of clausal bundles (over $4 0 \%$ ) in the essays also indicates an influence from spoken language. This mixed structure in L2 argumentative essays suggests that they occupy a midde ground between L1 spoken and writen genres: They do not fully miror the structure of either genre, but rather display a unique amalgamation of characterisic from both. This finding reall prior claims that the nature of argumentation allows a distinctive blending of elements from both spoken and written forms (e.g., Jaworska et al., 2015).

Table 4 summarizes the distribution of structural categories and subcategories in SC and wc, along with examples. Overall, no1 only do the main structural types in the two corpora greatly diffr (Fig. 1), but the analysis of subcategories also reveals that student significantly favored different structural types of bundles in the spoken and written contexts (Table 4).

![](img/3dbdb6cfcda006e0ea5286119dff7df6a8b4eb457d8be8aa1cef68ec8698a7b4.jpg)  
Fig. 1. Distribution of main structural categories.

Among the NP-based bundles, the students most often used NPs with embedded of-phrase fragments, which are characteristic of academic prose in thir esas , the deelome f th, on of the most). Intetingly, this is the subcatgory found lest frequently in the speeches produced by the same students. When they do appear i the speeches, the specfic phrases ., a thd y of and the range of courses) usually involve vocabulary related to topics such as student life and do not correspond to NP-based bundles generally reported as characterizing academic prose.

The LBs categorized as "other noun phrase" involve atributive adjectives across both corpora, with several shared bundles (i., found in both corpora). For instance,the shared bundle the most important thing was used in both speeches and essays produced to respond to the prompt \*What positive leons can we learn from the CoviD-19 pandemic?" Note that the bundle tends to take the same syntactic role of subjec in a subordinate clause in the two corpora, as shown in the following examples. However, in speches, students are more likely to preede the bunde wit I think, as in (1), while in esays, it i often preedd by the main clause of an anticipatory it verb phrase, as in (2). LBs are indicated in bold in the examples.

(1) I think the most important thing for nowadays pandemic is that how much can we regulate to, for our public health against our own will and freedom to go anywhere and protest like the kind of thing that we believe that is a very basic and we have our own rights since we born. (SC)   
(2) Just as iron was made in the event of an oil cris due to a lack of oil akey resource for the global economy, it sems the most important thing we need to do now is overcoming COvID-19. (WC)

As for PP-based bundles, their usage in the two corpora is markedly diffrent. PP-based LBs with embedded of-phrases (e.., t the end of, in the case of), previously identified as typical of academic prose, account for approximately $7 \%$ of all LBs in the WC but only about $0 . 5 \%$ in the SC. In addition, the other subtypes of PP-based bundles were also significantly more common in essays than in speeches. The manner in which these bundles are constructed in a broader context tends to deviate in speech and in writing, as demonstrated in the examples below, both in response to the same prompt. The bundle fo ong time more commonly ocurs in active voice sentences in the speeches, as in example (3), and in passive voice sentences in the essays, as in example (4). Passive voice constructions are typical of academic prose (e.g., Baratta, 2009; Hinkel, 2004; Salazar, 2014).

(3) Without covid, even the doctors, some doctors and professors do wear masks for a long time, but it's not necessary for all the doctors to wear the mask. (SC) (4) This is because companies will be closed and some workers will be unemployed for a long time. (WC)

Finally, we turn to VP-based LBs, which, as mentioned, are the most frequent main type in both corpora, although the proportions differ, with VP bundes occurring far more ofte in the speeches.Consistent with example (3) above, VP bundes with active verbs are significantly more frequent in speeches ( $1 6 . 4 \%$ of all LBs in the SC) than in essays (about $9 . 5 \%$ of all LBs in the wC). This trend in speeches cosely mirrors the findings from L1 conversation: Conrad and Biber (2005) reported a similar frequency of such bundes (e., have a look at) in L1 face-to-face conversation, which accounted for approximately $^ { 1 3 \% }$ Of all LBs in their data.

Furthermore, another VP bundle type, particularly characteristic of spoken language, shows a significant disparity between the SC and the wC. This type, involving personal pronouns, is far more common in the SC, where it comprises $4 2 . 1 \%$ of the LBs, compared to only $8 . 7 \%$ in the wC. Once again, the proportion in the SC is quite similar to that reported by Conrad and Biber (2005) for L1 con. versation, where VP bundles with pronouns (e.g., I don't know what) represent around $4 4 \%$ of all LBs. This comparison underscores a similarity between the structural characteristics of the L2 argumentative speeches in our study and L1 conversational language.

Despite the disparity between SC and wC, certain bundles are consistently used in both, and these bundles tend to reflect traits often found in spoken anguage. A notable example is the shared bunde,I think it is used in both corpora to directly address one of the writing prompts (i.e, about the usage of technology). However, the usage of I think bundles is more extensive in the speeches, comprising 20 types based on the I think bigram, such as I think this is I think it wil, and I think we should, which is significantly more than in the essays, with only seven types that occur with far less frequency.

In summary, these findings reveal that students do adapt their usage of different bundle types based on the two genres of academic English. In their speeches, students mainly employed clausal bundles, which are typically associated with L1 converstion, while in their essays, the same students strongly favored phrasal bundes, which are characteristic of academic prose (Biber et al., 2004). Prior studies, focusing solely on L2 writing, showed that learners heavily depend on clausal bundles in their writing. These studies consistently ae that lners undrstnding f acadmic rediffernes is limite, reultig in blurry boundries across genres in their production (e.g., Bychkovska & Lee, 2017; Leedham, 2015). By comparing spoken and writen data from the same student group, the present study confirms the reliance on clausal bundes in academic esays, but the comparative analysis further uncovers that students do demonstrate some awareness of the genre differences between their essays and their speeches.

# 5.3. Functional analysis of lexical bundles

Fig. 2illustrates the three primary functional categories found in the C and WC corpora. According to Biber et al. (1999, 2004),the most common bundles in conversational language express personal stances or opinions, whereas the most prevalent bundles in academic writing are primarilyrferential. The distribution of LB functions in the current data corresponds with these genre-specific differences, with the most frequent being stance bundles in the speeches (113 types, $6 1 . 7 \%$ of all LBs in the SC), and referential bundles in the essays (60 types, $4 7 . 6 \%$ Of all LBs in the WC).

In the SC, the two less frequent functions together account for $3 4 \%$ of all bundles, showing a distribution remarkably similar to that in L1 conversation, which stands at about $3 1 \%$ (Biber et al., 2004). In contrast, the wc displays a different pattern, where stance bundles, the second most common type at $4 4 . 4 \%$ hold a proportion nearly equivalent to that of the referential bundles. This markedly differs from the pattern observed in academic prose, where stance bundles represent approximately $1 5 \%$ . Such a trend suggests a propensity among L2 writers to expres personal stances in the argumentative esay genre, a predictable inclination considering the genre's primary unction is to expressa stance on a position (e.g., Shin, 2020; Wingate, 2012). When combined with the insights from the structural analysis (Section 5.2) these findings sugest that 2 argumentative speech closely mirrors conversational style, while 2 argumentative essays appear to bridge the gap between spoken and written genres.

Table 5 displays the function-based subcategories of LBs, revealing pronounced discrepancies between the L2 spoken and written genres.

With respect to stance expressions, the speeches exhibit a significantly greater quantity of epistemic bundles than the essays $( 1 5 . 3 \%$ of all LBs in the SC; $7 . 1 \%$ of all LBs in the wC). There are 28 epistemic bundles in the spoken genre, out of which 18 contain the term I think, which serves as a clear marker of stance and is considered typical of speech (Staples & Reppen, 2016).

Discourse organizer bundles, the least common type acrosthe two corpora, comprise two main subtypes, topic introduction and topic elaboration/clarification, with the students using more of the lattr in both spoken and written genres. Nevertheles, the two genres show considerable differences in specific bundles. Notably, the speeches often include discourse organizing bundles beginning with the coordinating conjunction so, which is commonly used in face-to-face conversation (e., Biber et al., 2011; Shin, Kim, Park, & Yu, 2019), these Bs account for 12 types. Examples of these bundes include o I ave to, s I m goingt, and so it's kind of. In contrast, in their writing, these same students tend to produce more discourse organizing bundle that begin with formal conjunctions and that introduce explicit supporting statements for their arguments, such as however due to the, irs of all the, and for these reasons I.

The examples below illustrate the use of LBs functioning as discourse organizers in the spoken (5) and written (6) contexts, responding to the same prompt (regarding the use of technology). In the spoken context, the student constructed two bundles both

In terms of referential bundes there is asignificant difference between the two corpora, with a higher usage of bundes serving this discourse function in the essays than in the speeches $( 2 3 . 5 \%$ of all LBs in the SC; $4 7 . 6 \%$ of all LBs in the wC). Every subcategory of referential LBs is used considerably more in the essays, but the difference is especiall large for identification/focus bundes (SC: $1 2 . 6 \%$ WC: $1 9 . 8 \%$ . Moreover, the types of bundles within this category differ between corpora. Some examples from the SC are young people in Korea, and I am a, and a high school student; in contrast, most of those in the WC are closer to phrases typicall found in academic witing  i one fthe) andthose fring apsition e. lfoms such as). nther sigficant stinctionin the use of referential categories between the two genres is evident in the employment of place/time/text-deixis. Students often employed location-related phrases such as t go back o and I m in the, which manifest as VP-bundes, in their seches. Conversely, they tend to use time-related phrases such as at the end of, by the end of, and in a short period in their eays. These phrases are primarily P-based, and they align with the academic-genre bundles previously documented in prior research.

Earlier studies that examined exclusively written data have shown that L2 learners use higher rates of stanceexpressing bundles in their written work than L1 or expert writers, who use more referential bundes (e.g., Bychkovska & Lee, 2017; Chen & Baker, 2010; Huang, 2015; Shin, 2019; Staples et al., 2013; Y0 & Shin, 2022). The present study confirms these findings, demonstrating astrong preference for stance bundles in student essays. However, the comparatie analysis of the spoken and written data reveals a marked difference: The speeches contain significantly more stance bundles, such as those including informal sequences like I think and I want to, but fewer referential bundes. The opposite pattern is observed in the essays. This disparity between spoken and wrtten genres, in production by the same group of students responding to the same prompts, suggests that learners do differentiate between the two styles of academic English to some degree, contra previous suggestions that they are unable to do so (e.g., Leedham, 2015).

Echoing the findings of Biber et al. (2004), who identified astrong correlation between structural types and discourse functions in lexical bundles across 1 spoken and written genres, the present study further elucidates this relationship. Biber and his colleagues observed that stance bundles are typically clausal in nature, while referential bundes lean toward a phrasal structure, with discourse organizers employing a variety of structures. This correlation, they argue, is closely linked to genre, with conversational speech favoring clausal bundles for stance expression and academic writing preferring phrasal bundles for referential purposes.

However, in this study, divergent pattens emerge in the L2 data, particularly in referential functions. In L2 argumentative essays, $8 3 . 3 \%$ f referential bundles are phrasal (e.g., in the case of, in the number of), aligning with the L1 genre pattern. In stark contrast, L2 argumentative speeches show a different trend: Only $1 6 . 7 \%$ of referential bundles are phrasal, while a substantial majority of over $6 0 \%$ are clausal (e.g., have got  few, go back in time). This striking contrast highlights that L2 learners' aplication of form and function in lexical bundles does not consistently mirror L1 patterns, particularl in spoken context. The finding sheds light on an inriguing aspect of L2 genre adaptation, especially evident in the argumentative speech genre.

Table 6 compares the bundles common in L1 data and in L2 data by presenting the functional distribution of 23 shared bundles between L1 conversation and academic prose (Biber et al. 2004) alongide their usage in the bundles identified in this study. The comparison reveals how both L1 and L2 speakers use these specific bundles across spoken and written genres. Notably, over $5 0 \%$ of the bundles $( n = 1 2 )$ , such as I think it was and $i f$ you want to, are found in both conversation and L2 argumentative speeches. A smaller proportion of bundles, about $2 6 \%$ $( n = 6 )$ , including is one of the and in the case of, are shared between academic prose and L2 essays. Two bundes, I would ik to and it is mportant to, are common across three geres. The former, typically assciated with onversation, also appears in L2 peeches and essays. In the context of argumentative writing, its presence is somewhat reasonable, as the bundle serves the function of ffectively conveying stances on propositions (Shin, 2020). The later, commonly found in academic prose is found in both  seches and essays. Given that i is importn t serves to clerly direct the reader t take some action Biber t al. 2004, p. 391), its use in formal spoken contexts, particularly in argumentative settings, seems appropriate. Moreover, this bundle is frequentl deployed in the argumentative essay genre by both L1 and L2 speakers (Shin, 2019). This pattern suggests that learners application of such bundle in argumentatie contexts is appropriate and indicative of their understanding of genre-specific language use.

In addition, certain bundes, such as one of the most and at the same time, transcend genre, appearing in both L1 conversation and academic prose as wellas in L2 essays and speeches. Itriguingly, the presence of what I want to, a topic-introducing bundle typically associated with conversation (Biber e l., 2004), in L2 essays suggests that L2 writers may be inadvertently blending conversational elements into their academic writing. This indicates a potential blurring in their understanding of genre-specific language requirements, although this observation is limited to one bundle.

# 6. Conclusion

The present study is among a few attempts to explore the extent to which L2 learners produce the formulaic language expected for spoken and written genres of academic English. The study used closely matched corpora of argumentative essays and speeches produced in response to the same prompts by the same group of EFL Korean tertiary students. Overal, a significant amount of the LBs in the students production across genres involved atitudinal/modal expressions (e.g., Iwould ike to) and informal quantity expressions (e., have t f) as el as Bs wth gramatical eors therein (., the deveoment of \*the ollectively rerred to as leaner bundles' in the literature.

However,adetailed comparative analysis of spoken and written contexts within the same semantic domains revealed that students LB use significantly diverges, both in types and tokens, in each genre of academic English. The findings indicate that students tend to employ features of academic written language in their esays, frequently drawing on nominal/prepositional bundles, whereas their spoken language relies more on clausal bundle. In practice, even the shared bundles (those found in both spoken and written corpora) are not always used in the same manner in the two genres. For example, they varied in the word ombinations used before or after these bundles in different contexts. Contrary to previous assumptions that L2 English learners do not distinguish between informal and academic genres, or between speech and writing - often intereted as a lack f awarenessor inbility to adapt language production to genre- this study demonstrates that leners constct the contexs fBs, incudin idntical sets of bunde, in ways that ifferentiate oral and written language, even when responding to the same prompts, suggesting that learners may have a more nuanced understanding of how to use formulaic language in both spoken and written genres than previously recognized.

It is important to clarify that our results are certainly also influenced by the inherent nature of language production in speaking versus writing. That is thediffernes in bundl sage ae aso relat mode, refleting thedistinct contive and ingistic demands of producing language in real time versus in planned and edited formats, in addition to the learners intentional choices to adapt their language to the given gere. Thus, while our findings support the possbilit that learners have a more complex understanding of genre than they are often assumed to have, they also highlight the need for multifaceted approaches to studying language use that consider communicative context In short, we suggest that our participants were able to adapt their use of bundles to the specific genres of argumentative speeches and argumentative essays, but were alo, inevitably, affcted by the distinct processing demands of the two language modes. The learners made strategic language choices to meet their communicative goals while producing language under these diffrent types of constrints. Future research should help us further elucidate the complexities of language use across ifferent modes of communication and the interaction of mode and genre in learner production; meanwhile, this study emphasizes that genre awarenesand communicative competence in an aditional language are not static skils but dynamic and complex social processes.

This position is further supported when we juxtapose our findings with previous findings on 1 bundles (Biber et al., 2004; Conrad & Biber, 2005), which we consider as abaseline; the comparison makes it evident that L2 argumentative genres have distinct char. acterisics: L2 speech closely aligns with the conversational genre, while L2 essays seem to occupy a middle ground betwen conversational and academic prose. Looking ahead, a more effctive external comparison would require tictly matched data of L1 bundles in these two genres to ascertain genre-specific LB usage. Such a comparison iscrucial to determine whether the relatively higher use of clausal bundes in 2 agumentatie essays is a charactristic of Eglish lners, or if i is inherently linked to the nature of the argumentative essay genre isef, which often combines features typical of spoken genres, such as personal statements, with elements of academic writing, like nominalization and critical analysis e.g., Jaworska et al., 2015). It is also conceivable that both of these factors influence the patterns we observed. Future research that systematicall compares L1 and L2 spoken and written genres promises to be of great interest.

The research results preented here could have significant implications for the teaching of L2 academic English. Specificll, the list of frequentlyoccurring multiword sequences found in the poken and written dat of the L1-Korean students presented in Table 2, and the subsequent structural and functional analysis of these sequences (Tables 4 and 5), provide a clear picture of how this student population manipulates formulaic sequences across diferent genres. This information could prove invaluable for asssing learners understanding and application of conventional practices of professional academics. Furthermore, a unique and noteworthy charac. teristic of the leaner bundles observed here is the repetition of the same bi-grams or tri-grams across multiple bundles and across genres, as evidenced by the data in Table 2. This finding suggests that L2 learners have a tendency to depend on smallr units when constructing longer phrases or sentences. A prime example involves the students use f the phrase Ithink. They employed three times as many tyes and over seven times the number of tokens contaning this bi-gram in their speeches than in their esays. Specifically, n the speches, 18 ts f undes were idtifie, mounting to 324 tokns  IthinI ca, I thk i wil, think thee ae), hile the essays yielded six types with 42 tokens e.g., thin it is I think we should). Moreover, al of the types in the eas are shared bundes: They occur in the speeches as well. ccording to Biber et al's (2011) proposed developmental stages of L2 writing, such tructures are indicative of an initial stage, characterized by the use of dependent clause structures with verbs commonly found in conversational language, such as think, know, and say. The findings of this study, based on a comparative analysis of spoken and written academic data from the same cohort of student, reveal that whil I think bundles still ppear in the students essays, they are significantly less frequent than in their speeches. This discrepancy indicates that the students are developing an awarenes of the genre differences between these two genres of academic English, and are adjusting their language use accordingly.

In addition, the findings of the study have pedagogical implications for data-driven learning (DL) implemented in classroom settings. For example, as an in-clss activity, a class can discuss how the same bundes are incorporated in context. Recent studies have shown that learners do not necessarily embed bundles in larger structures in the same way that native peakers do. For instance, Shin (2018b) showed that whil L1-English writrstend to incorporate LBs into phrasal structure inacademic essays, L2-English writers are more likely to embed the same bundes in clausal stuctures; this finding implies that to fully exploit LBs as tols for L2 pedagogy, analyses need to go beyond their internal structures to understand their use in context by different populations. To demonstrate different ways recurrent sequences are constructed in concordance lines, as well as to explicitly intruct leaners in which sequences are appropriat for a target genre (e.g., spoken/written genres), comparable spoken and written texs could be of great help in L2 writing settings and EAP programs.

Moreover, during the data analysis, it was not uncommon to observe learners' misuse of function words within LBs. These findings align with research (e.g., Lee, Yo0, & Shin, 2020; Shin, Cortes, & Yo0, 2018) highlighting the challenges English learners face with function words within B, often producing partilly correct tructures like one of most and at he midde of insted of the target bundes one of the most and in the middle of. Automatic, data-driven, frequency-based procedures used to identify LBs cannot detect such learners' attempts to produce a bundle. Given that LBs are fixed sequences with embedded specific linguistic items, and that almos all the bundles identified in academic prose include articles and/or prepositions (e.g., Biber et al., 199, 2004), several studies have suggested that bundes have strong potential as a pedagogical tol. Some of this reearch has shown that explicit instruction using LBs can lead to significant improvements in the usage of articles (Shin & Kim, 2017) and prepositions (Kang, Shin, & Yoo, 2024) among English leaners. Such evidence supports the effectiveness f explicitl teaching these elements by leveraging the structured nature of bundes, whil the indings f the current study - especilly in the written academic genre - indicate the merit of teaching English learners the usage of challenging linguistic elements, such as function words, in recurrent multiword sequences in context.

To conclude, most corpus-based research on learner production targets academic writing, with very few studies comparing it to academic speech. To the best of our knowledge, there are no publicly available EFL corpora of academic spoken and written data produced by the same group of English learners. The findings of ths study, which suggest laners' genre awarenes, underscore the potential of these students to show growth and mastery in academic writing and spoken language, which should encourage further investigation into teaching methods that can make use of this awarenes, refining and channeling it for more precise and effective language usage. Future studies should focus on developing strategies to bridge the gap between recognizing distinctions i spoken and written language and applying this knowledge effectively in language learning.
