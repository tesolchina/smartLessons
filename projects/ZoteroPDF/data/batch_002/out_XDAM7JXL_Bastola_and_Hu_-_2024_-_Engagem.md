Supervisory feedback

Student engagement has attracted much research attention in higher education because of various potential benefits associated with improved engagement. Despite extensive research on student engagement in higher education, little has been written about graduate students' engagement with supervisory feedback. This paper reports on a study on student engagement with supervisory feedback on master's theses conducted in the context of Nepalese higher education. The study employed an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design that drew on interviews and a questionnaire-based survey involving supervisors and students from four disciplines at a comprehensive university in Nepal. Analyses of the qualitative and quantitative data revealed significant differences between supervisors' and students' perceptions of all types (i.e., affective, cognitive, and behavioral) of student engagement. Significant disciplinary variations were also observed in supervisors' and students' perceptions of negative affect, cognitive engagement, and behavioral engagement. Furthermore, disciplinary background and feedback role interacted to shape perceptions of student engagement. These findings have implications for improving student engagement with supervisory feedback.

# 1. Introduction

Interest in student engagement was initially motivated by the desire to enhance the academic achievement of at-risk students (Reschly & Christenson, 2012). However, over the years, it has developed into an ever important approach to learning, teaching, policy-making, and educational reearch in higher education (Kahu, 2013; Zepke, 2017). Contributing to its widespread uptake are a range of benefits that can arue to improved student engagement: cognitive, psychological and moral development; practical competence and skil transferability; improved social relations and social capital; positive self-images and higher academic achievement (Harper & Quaye, 2015). Against this backdrop, one important trand of research on student engagement has examined students agentic involvement in learning (Kahu, 2013; McMahon & Porteli, 2004; Zepke, 2017), undergraduate students' engagement with feedback on coursework (Carles t al., 2011; Handey et al., 2011), and graduate students' engagement with supervisory fedback on their theses (Zheng et al., 2020). This paper focuses on student engagement with supervisory feedback.

A thesis is \*erhaps the most significant piece of writing that any student willever do, a formidable task of intimidating length and exacting expectations (Hyland, 2004, p. 134). In their thees, students nd to present themselves as knowledge producers. Therefore, they must engage in linguistically complex and cognitively demanding academic litracy practices by drawing on various sources of information and developing a line of reasoning, which sometimes can be overwhelming. In this regard, supervisory feedback plays a crucial role in socializing students into disciplinary knowledge-making and discourse practices (Kumar & Stracke, 2011; Yu & Lee, 2013) and ensuring research quality because it is \*talored to the specific needs of students at the point when they are most likely to benefit from it (Bitchener, 2017, p. 90). It is worth noting that academic writing, written feedback, and communications between supervisor and supervisee are sophisticated written genres, though supervisory feedback and related interactions can also be conducted orall or oline. Since supervisors have typically acquired disciplinary norms and conventions through tact practice, they may struggle to articulate these norms and conventions for their students even if they recognize problems in student texts (Pare, 2011). While explicit instruction from supervisors is reorted  impact student liteacy skill significantly (Ba & Feng, 2023), inuficient or confusing feedback can seriously undermine their acquisition of disciplinary literacy practice (Pare, 2011; Salter-Dvorak, 2017). It should be noted that supervisory fedback is helpful only to the extent students (are willing to) engage with it (de Kleijn et al., 2016). Engagement with feedbackis a multi-stage proces ranging from reception to enactment (Price et a. 2010). Importantly, engagement is not students' sole responsibility because feedback is a dialogic process profoundly medated by factors related to students, feedack content,feedback providers, and institutional contexts (Winstone et al., 2017). Research on engagement with supervisory feedback, however, is thin on the ground. Despite a growing number of students writing their master's thesis (Cornelius & Nicol, 2016; Ginn, 2014) littlehas been written on their engagement with supervisory feedback (Zheng et al., 2020). There is a clear need for further research if we are to develop a fuller understanding of how supervisory feedback can best support masters students learning and development.

# 1.1. Conceptualizing student engagement

Previous scholarship has explored student engagement from behavioral, psychological, sociocultural, and holistic perspectives (Kahu, 2013; McMahon & Porteli, 2004). The behavioral perspective focuses on student behaviors and emphasizes their investment of time and effort in purposeful activities intended to promote good academic conduct and achievement (McMahon & Portell, 2004; Reschly & Christenson, 2012). While it underscores the importance of student behaviors in institutional contexts, the behavioral perspective, with its typical focus on at risk' students, takes a largely defit view of engagement, suggesting that if the student is disengaged, then the problem is with the student (Zyngier, 2008, p. 1771). The psychological and sociocultural perspectives, n contrast, recognize personal, interpersonal, and institutional contributors to engagement (Axelson & Flick, 2010; Harper & Quaye, 2015; McMahon & Portell, 2004; Zepke, 2017). The former views student engagement as a multidimensional psycho-social process that unfolds over time, and the latter see student engagement as the product of a larger socio-cultural context (Kahu, 2013). Both perspectives tend to reduce the complex relationships between quality support and student engagement t strightforward cause-ffect relationships. Finall, the holistic perspective, grounded in a critical-democratic tradition, considers student engagement as a dialectical relationship in a temporal and social context that contributes to personal transformation and empowerment (McMahon & Portelli, 2004). The perspective also recognizes the central role of students' motivation and expectations in their engagement (Kahu, 2013). Despite the differences in scope, all these perspectives agree that engagement leads to success (academic, personal, or life-wide).

Thanks to the four perspectives, student engagement is generally conceptualized today as a multidimensional meta-construct with dynamicall intlad behavioral , investment of time and ffort), cogntiv ., elf-egulation, pereverance, mental efort, and concentration on learning), and affective (eg, happiness, sadness, anxiety, sense of belongingness, and identity) dimensions (Axelson & Flick, 2010; Fredrics et l., 2004; Khu, 2013; Zeke, 2017). In adtion, its antdnts (., tctural and psycholgical factors) and proximal (ie, learning achievement, satisfaction, and well-eing) and distal (i.e., retention, work sucess lifelong learning, citizenship, and personal growth) consequences have been emphasized (Kahu, 2013).

Influenced by the perspectives outlined above, current research on student engagement with feedback on their work characterizes the construct in affective, behavioral, and cognitie terms (Yu et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2020). Affectie engagement with feedback refers to students' emotional states and processes (i.e., affect, judgment, appreciation, enthusiasm, and interest) involved in responding tofeedback (heng et al., 2020). Such emotions mostly hinge upon the types of fedback that they receive. While positive feedback may provide them with a sense of support, encouragement and the incentive to act on the feedback (Fin & Zimmer, 2012), negative and upseting fedback can damage their elf-confidence (Henderson et al. 2019) and may even lead to failure and eventual drop-out (Tai et al., 2019). Cognitive engagement with feedback involves students' cognitie states and processes, such as understanding and processing the information contained in the feedback, monitoring the revision proces, and self-regulating learning (Yu et al., 2019; heng et al., 2020). Behavioral engagement with feedback oncerns the behavioral states and proceses of responding to the feedback, for example, spending time revising an assignment to improve its quality (Han & Hyland, 2019; Yu e l., 2019; Zheng et al., 2020). Extant research has shown that students' affctive engagement has an impact on their behavioral and cognitive engagement (Wagener, 2018; Zheng et al., 2020).

# 1.2. Research on master's students' engagement with supervisory feedback

Research on student engagement with supervisory feedback at the master's level i rather limited. Despite our extensive searches, we have been able to locate only a handful of published studies conducted in the context of master's supervision. Two studies (i.,

Cooper, 2019; Wagener, 2018) underscored the role of affct. Wagener (2018) demonstrated that afect played a central role in students interpersonal relationships with their supervisors as well as their success. Therefore, he accentuated the need to limit negative emotions and promote positive ones, although some amount of negative affect might be unavoidable. Similarly, Cooper's (2019) case study revealed that the focal student's passionate engagement with her work, reflcted in her questioning perspective, critical reflection, concern for reearch integrit and the courage to go beyond received wisdom, led her toauthentic transformations in knowledge, understanding, and perspective' (p. 12).

Three studies, particularly relevant to our inquiry, explored student engagement with supervisory feedback as a multidimensional construct. Zheng 's et al. (2020) study of three master's students at a Macau university showed that the students were emotionally, cognitively, and behaviorally engaged with feedback. Positive reassurance, complimentary comments, and trust in supervisors feedback promoted the students' affective engagement. They selectively attended to feedback focusing on the comments that were explicit, instructional and related to macro issues, and engaged with academic discourse by incorporating more literature than was demanded by the supervisor. Converely, unclear feedback, limited research skills and experience, and differing expectations compromised their cognitie engagement, prompting them to be strategic in revising their writig. In a recent study (Neupane Bastola & Hu, 2021c), students rported high levels of affctive, conitive, and behavioral engagement with feedback, which was mediated by care, motivation, inspiration, and support from supervisors. The researchers noted that a les-optimal supervisor-student relationship and overly negative supervisory fedback contributed to students plummeting self-confidence, demotivation, and negative attitudes towards thesis writing itself. Like students in Zheng 's et al. (2020) study, these students did not attend to comments that were less binding and unclear. However, a study (Neupane Bastola & Hu, 2023) exploring supervisors' perceptions of student engagement revealed that supervisors, in general, tended to atribute students negative affct and inadequate behavioral and cognitive engagement to a limited understanding of research as an academic activity, negative attitudes towards multiple revisions of their theses, and the prioritization of graduation over learning from the research process.

Although these studies have added to our understanding of student engagement with supervisory feedback, there is a paucity of research comparing supervisors and students' perceptions of student engagement with supervisory feedback. Such a comparison is neessary to reveal points of dferences, idntify problematic ars in supervisory feedback and student engagment, and sugest ways of moving forward to improve student engagement. The present study is an endeavor to this end.

# 1.3. Disciplinary variation in feedback practices

Disciplines have varying needs, preference, and feedback cultures (Winstone & Carless 2020). Therefore, supervisory feedback is vital in socializing students into discipline-specific academic culture and familiarizing them with legitimate ways of writing and meaning-making in their discipline (Heerden et al., 2017; Hyland, 2013; Kobayashi et al., 2017; Kumar & Stracke, 2011). However, research on discilinary variation in feback in general and supervisory feedack in particular is sill t an embryonic stage Hyland 2013). Extant research has shown that tutors across disciplines seemed to consider academic literacy as naturalized, self-evident, non-contestable and common-sense knowledge (Hyland, 2013). Corroborating Hyland's (2013) finding, two studies on supervisory feedback (Basturkmen et al., 2014; Bitchener et al., 2010) did not find disciplinary variation in supervisory feedack However, other studies (Neupane Bastola & Hu, 2021a, 2021b, 2021c, 2023) have reported such differences. To account for disciplinary differences Herden et l. (2017) drew on Maton's (2014) Legitimation Code Theory and posited that appropriate tutor fedback in English studies (operating with a knower code) i different from that i Law (a disciline dominated by a knowledge code) because the former should focus on tacit knowlge and critil onse rather than accuracy butth ltter nusig conci, grmmticlly coc entnce as being essentia to realizing clarit of meaning and attention to detil (p. 974). A recent study by Carlesset al. (2023) on undergraduate courses in four disciplines uncovered some signature feedack practice of these disciplines. For example, in architecture, feedback interactions were planned and designed within the curriculum to provide students with opportunitie to discuss and clarify feedback through critcal reviews. In contrst, in education, end-of-semester assinments with summative feedback were common, although there were  few cases of two-stage asignments supported by audio or video feedback In enginering and medicine, there were imited opportunities for students to receive individualized feedback as the focus was on collective feedback, automated feedback, and portfolio-based tutorials. Critical reviews in architecture and bedside rounds in medicine were isciplinary-specific signature practes.

A small body of research has also explored disciplinary variations in supervisory feedback. For example, Pare (2011) observed that while establishing a specific and generally agred-upon knowledge gap is valued in thesciences and quantitative social research with an incremental and collaborative accumulatio of knowledge, the researchers in the humanities and the qualitative traditions of social sciences are les concerned with such generally understood knowledge gaps, \*although they would need to argue that the questions they were addressing deserved attention (.68). Ba0 & Feng, (2023) study demonstrated that adoctoral supervisor in a department of English aplied linguisics ocused on genre conventions when providing feedback on his four doctoral students' manuscripts for publication. In general, the students' attention was drawn to \*what content i communicated, to whom it is communicated, and how it is communicated' (p. 13).

More directly relevant to the present study is research exploring disciplinary variations in supervisory feedback on master's thees. In this regard, Eriksson and Nordrm (2018) highlighted the need for feedback on data commentary for chemical engineering students. Five studies (Neupane Bastola, 2021; Neupane Bastola & Hu, 2021a, 2021b, 2021c, 2023) involving four disciplines (i.e., English ducation, Eglish stdies, psics, and eginerig at  Nepale unverst entified diciplr riations in fack practices as well as students' and supervisors' perceptions of supervisory feedback. In the applied disciplines (i., English education and engi. neering), directive comments focusing on implications, practical values, and contributions of research were more emphasized than in the pure disciplines (i.e., physics and English studies). In physics, the practices of matching supervisors' and students' research interests, helping students select a researchable topic, and providing pre-writing, peer, and group feedback were common. Engineering students rceived fewer in-text comments than those in the other disciplines because of the predominance of oral fedback. Since the theses in English studies mostly focused on textual analysis, the need for supervisory feedback on certain part-geres (i.., research design and data analysis) was mostly obviated. In English education and English studies, students opportunities to receive constructive feedback were compromised by a heavier supervision load and an inconducive institutional research culture ., absence of a clear stipulation on supervisory workload and unavailabilit of separate office space). While physics supervisors were wiling to proofread students work, English studies supervisors expected their students to take care of their own language isues because they believed that too much corrective fdback would negatively impact students' creativity. Students in English Education, English Studies, and Engineering were more dissatisfied with supervisory feedback and reported experiencing more negative emotions than their counterparts in Physis did. English education and English studies students faced more acute language constraints than Physics and Enginering students did (Neupane Bastola & Hu, 2021a), and similar perceptions were held by supervisors in the respective disciplines (Neupane Bastola & Hu, 2023). Despite the profound role of supervisory feedback in helping students engage with disciplinary knowledge-making, experienced members of the disciplinary communities tend to take the disciplinary requirements for granted (Heerden et al., 2017; Hyland, 2013). Therefore, disciplinary variation in supervisory feedback practices warrants more focused research with a view to enhancing students' disciplinary socialization and improving graduate research and supervision (Becher, 1994). This study aims to bridge this research gap.

In response to the research gaps identified above, the present study set out to answer the following research questions:

1. How do supervisors perceptions of student engagement with supervisory feedback diffr from students' own perceptions? 2. How do supervisors' and students' perceptions of student engagement with supervisory feedback vary across disciplines? 3. How do discilinary background and feedback role (i.., supervisor as fedack provider vs. student a feedback reiver) interact to shape perceptions of student engagement?

# 2. Methodology

# 2.1. Research design

This study was conducted at a comprehensive university in Nepal, involving master's thesis supervisors and students from four disciplines. The four disciplines were selected following Becher's (1994) typology of disciplines and Bernstein's (1999) distinction between hierarchical and horizontal knowledge structures. These four disciplines included physics (hard-pure), engineering (hard-applied), English studies (soft-pure), and English education (soft-applied). In all selected disciplines, students must write a master's thesis in English, a foreign language in Nepal. Although both Nepali and English are the official languages of instruction in higher education in Nepal, English is preferred because of its prestge and the ailability of materials in the language. Even though English is not the mandatory language for a master's thesis students tend to belie that they wil be awarded bettr marks if they write their theses in English (Shrestha, 2008). However, despite English being taught as a compulsory subject from Grade 1 tothe undergraduate level, it i one of the subject that many students ail (ryl t al., 2016), espeially in overment-unded schools. Most of the students in the focal university come from Nepali-medium schoos and, therefore, tend to have developing English academic literacy. However, there is no provision of English academic writing support, and the university-level mechanism for ensuring research ethics and integrity is yet to be established firmly. At the focal universt, thesis writing is compulsory in English education and engineering but optional in English studies and physics. Students who have to write a thesis against thir will tend to find the thesis-writing process more challenging than those who willigly choose to do so. The focal universit's centralized teaching-learning system seems to give more priorit to teaching, knowledge transmission, and the use of examinations as the dominant mode of assessment (Tripath et al. 2020). Faculty members are expected to supervise master's theses, regardlessof their research experience. Supervisors are always involved in the final evaluation of the theses that they have supervised. Therefore, supervisors play the dual role of supporting their supervisees and gatekeeing. It is common for supervisorsto present themselves as experts' and gatekeepers, with students mostly assuming subservient positions (Neupane Bastola & Ho, 2022).

We employed an exploratory sequential mixed-methods design to develop two new self-report questionnaires for colecting supervisors' and students' perceptions of student engagement with supervisory feedback, respectively. This design allowed us to triangulate our findings through qualitative and quantitative data and achieve complementarity in our interpretations (Greene, 2007). In the first phase, we selected four supervisor-student pairs from each discipline by means of maximum variation in supervisors experience, age, academic qualification, and research output (Flyvbjerg, 2004). Each supervisor was then asked to select one student. Each supervisor and their student were interviewed twice and separately to ensure the confidentialit of the interviews and triangulate the interviewees views (Patton, 2015). The first interview, about 15 min long, was used for building rapport collecting background information, and setting up the second interview. The second interview, lasting between 45 and $6 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ , was guided by an interview protocol containing questions on various aspects of supervisory feedback, including student engagement (see Appendix B). The interviews were conducted in Nepali, audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and sent to the participants for verification to ensure ac. curate representation of their views. The extracts presented in this article were translated into English by the first author, and the accuracy of the translation was checked by a second person highly proficient in both languages.

In the second phase, 250 supervisors and 650 students in the four selected disciplines were invited to complete a questionnaire administered via Google Forms. Among them, 102 supervisors and 462students completed the questionnaires. The supervisors (males $= 8 6$ , females $= 1 6$ ) were aged between 30 and 67 years ( $M = 4 4 . 9 3$ $S D = 8 . 2 4 _ { . }$ , with teaching experience ranging between 2 and 45 years $\mathbf { \zeta } M = 1 8 . 3 8$ $S D = 8 . 8 3 $ ). Fifty-seven $( 5 5 . 9 \% )$ supervisors held a PhD, 24 $( 2 3 . 5 \% )$ an M.Phil., and 21 $( 2 0 . 6 \% )$ a master's degree. They were more or less evenly distributed across the four disciplines: English education $= 2 6$ , English studies $= 3 0$ physics $= 2 7$ , and engineering $^ { = 1 9 }$ Of the 462 completed student questionnaires, 434 were valid (males $= 3 0 6$ , females $= 1 2 8$ ; English education $^ { } = 1 0 8$ English studies $= 9 3$ , physics $= 8 6$ , engineering $= 1 4 7$ ). The students were aged between 20 and 32 $\textstyle ( M = 2 4 . 0 6$ $S D = 2 . 8 3 $ . Prior to the data collection, IRB approval of this study was given by the Human Subjects Ethics Subcommitee of the authors univerty (Reference No.: HSEARs20180326003). All the participants gave informed consent in writing to participate in the study.

# 2.2. Instrumentation

Informed by the relevant literature, a corpus-based analysis of supervisory comments on master's theses and a thematic analysis of the interviews with the 16 supervisors and their students in Phase 1, we developed two parallel questionnaires (i.e., Supervisor Perceptions of Supervisory Feedback and Student Perceptions of Supervisory Feedback) covering five diffrent aspects, namely feedback purposes, feedback foci, student expectations, chllenges, and student engagement with supervisory feedback. Both ques tionnaires contained the same items worded acording to the respondents' statuses (i.e., supervisor or student) and required them to indicate their extent of agreement with the given statements on a 6-point Likert scale (i.e., ${ \bf 1 } =$ strongly disagree, $2 =$ disagree, ${ \boldsymbol { 3 } } =$ somewhat disagree, $4 =$ somewhat agree, $5 =$ agree, $6 =$ strongly agree) (see Appendix A). The questionnaires also contained two open-ended questions asking the participants to describe their memorable experiences and provide sugestions for improving master's thesis supervision. The questionnaires were piloted with 60 supervisors and 120 students, and principal component analyses (PCA) with direct oblimin rotation were run on the pilot data to establish the construct validity of the various scales. The component solutions of the PCAs from the pilot study were compared with the component structures obtained for the data collected for the main study. The PCAs run on the two datasets yielded the same factor structres, indicating the good construct validty of the scale for both supervisors and students. In this paper, we focus only on the questionnaire items addressing student engagement with supervisory feedback. Table 1 summarizes the scales of student engagement and reliability estimates based on the main study dataset. As the Cronbach's alphas indicate, most of the scales were at an accetable level (0.6-0.7) or a very good level f reliabilit (0.8 or above) (Ursachi t al. 2015), but the scale of negative affect for supervisors had low reliability.

# 2.3. Data analysis

Two-way ANOVAs were run on the engagement scales to answer the thre research questions: (mis)alignment between supervisors and the students' peceptions of tudent engagement, disciplinary variation, and the interaction between feedback role and discipline in the supervisors' and the students' perceptions of engagement with supervisory feedback. A thematic analysis adopting Braun and Clarke's (2006) six-stage procedure was conducted on the interviews and the responses to the open-ended questions in the survey. First, the interviews were transcribed verbatim and read multiple times by the first author to develop an initial familirity with the data. Second, the interviews and the answers to the open-ended questions in the surveys were coded according to ascheme of in. dicators of engagement with supervisory feedback identified quantitatively in the questionnaire responses. Allthe initial codes, together with related data extracts, were reviewed and revised by the first author to ensure that the finalized codes weredistinct from each other and captured the meanings of the dataset well. Next, themes were constructed by examining the identified codes; combining, clustering and collapsing them into bigger coherent and meaningful pattens; and identifying central organizing concepts. The preliminary themes, together with all the subsumed codes and relevant data extracts, were reviewed by the second author, and all instances of disagrement were discussed and resolved between the two authors. This proces led to the identification of four themes capturing stdent egagment with supervisory fedack ., postie affect, ntive afft, bavioral engagment, and conitive engagement). Finally, the themes were defined and related to the research questions, and representative data extracts were selected to illustrate them (see Appendix C).

# 3. Results

# 3.1. Supervisors' vs. students' perceptions of student engagement with supervisory feedback

The supervisors and the students held significantly different views on all four engagement scales (i.e., positie afect, negative affect, cognitive engagement, and behavioral engagement, with the latter perceiving themselves as more engaged with supervisory feedback. Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics for the supervisors' and the students' perceptions.

# 3.1.1. Positive affect

The ANoVA run on perceptions of positive affect found a significant main effect for feedback role, $F ( 1 , 5 2 8 ) = 8 0 . 0 3 $ $p { = } . 0 0 1$ $\boldsymbol \eta ^ { 2 } \boldsymbol \ p$ $= . 1 3$ with the students rating their positive afect markedly higher than the supervisors did. Feedback role explained $^ { 1 3 \% }$ of the variance, evidencing a large effect size.

Altogether 11 of the 434 student respondents to the questionnaire commented on their positive affect in their responses to the open-ended questions in the survey. They mainly associated their pleasant experience with supervisors' interest, availability, encouragment, guidane, and support  diecting thm to relevant resources). They felt motivated when ther supervisors focused on \*improvement rather than criticizing for many errors and deficiencies" $\left( \mathrm { P S t 2 4 } \right) ^ { 3 }$ and provided \*valuable instructions, suggestions, guidance, and strong cooperation (st30). Students were also grateful to their supervisors for understanding their life dificulties and showing care, as illustrated in the following quote:

I had a 1-year-old baby then. I faced many dificulties while writing my thesis, but my supervisor fully supported me by understanding my difficulties. I really salute him. (PSt69).

Some students considered thesis writing a positive and joyful experience because it provided them with opportunities to \*learr something new (PSt26), become \*more active and creative" (PSt59), and \*experience diffrent aspects of study (PSt59)

Six supervisors who commented on students' positive affect said that their tudents were grateful because they could understand the research proce.through the series of feedback esions" (Es20), lean at last one thing important in every sitting [with the supervisor]" (EES3), and receive non-academic support such as obtaning "leave approval from the company to complete the thesis' (ESS93).

# 3.1.2. Negative affect

There was a significant main effect of feedback role on the perceptions of negative affect, $F ( 1 , 5 2 8 ) = 1 7 . 0 1 , p = . 0 0 1 ,$ $\boldsymbol \eta _ { \mathsf { p } } ^ { 2 } = . 0 3$ with the supervisors perceiving greater negative afect than the students did. However, the large standard deviation for the students perceptions showed considerable intragroup variations. Feedback role explained only ${ } ^ { 3 \% }$ of the variance, which was a small effect.

A much larger number of student respondents $( n = 2 2 7 .$ ) shared negative affect as their unforgettable experiences, identifying four main sources of their ngative emotions (i.., supervisors, inadequate kills the daunting nature of thesis writing, and fear). ome of the common expressions used to describe their negative feeings include: disappointed, frustrate bitter experience, insulte, worried, scolde, h i, th stes c, d, tr kd trril rril, iel wt, d ul h w e when their supervisors provided negative feedback impolitely, \*commented on their personal qualities rather than issues related to the thesis' (Esst39), were unavailable for consultation, imposed challenging requirements, failed to provide clear guidelines, or underestimated their potential, as can be seen in the following quotes:

It is very frustrating to keep waiting for the supervisor. He was not available when I needed him. (EsSt18)

Originally, I had a different mental map about writing my thesis, but the whole plan changed when my supervisor asked me t take a different path. That was the reason why I went through hard times during my thesis writing. (EESt91)

At the beginning, when I told my supervisor that I wanted to conduct a study on texts written in Nepali, he asked me, Can you do it?" This is not bad language in itself, but I felt underestimated and took it as a challenge. (Esst2-Interview)

Sometimes negative emotions stemmed from the need for multiple revisions, the conflicting perspectives held by thesis commitee members, students partially deloped English academic literacy skill, lack of knowledge about citation and referencing, and limited access to required resources. For example, one student commenced the journey with fear and faced multiple rejections:

I was personally very scared of thesis writing .. and I had no experience of writing and zero ideas on choosing atopic and doing research. As a result, my proposal was rejected, later, my thesis was rejected, and I started doing another project. (EESt49)

Another student equated thesis writing with a terrible choking experience:

Yes, it is true that dealing with research is not easy work but sometimes, it becomes like a stone that i stuck in your throat. One can neither swallow it nor throw it out. I have felt the same emotional tragedy while completing my thesis because it was completely different from what I initially proposed. (EsSt30)

Four supervisors who commented on negative affct atributed students' native emotions to their lack of resilience to face critical comments and their limited understanding of research as a serious academic undertaking. One supervisor lamented that \*it is hard to make students realize the gravity of writing the thesis. Most of them tend to think that the supervisor is intentionally giving them a burden" (EES18).

# 3.1.3. Cognitive engagement

There was asignificant main effect f feedback role on the supervisors and the students perceptions of cognitive engagement, F(3, $5 2 8 ) _ { \mathrm { ~ = ~ } } 2 0 5 . 5 4$ A $p { = } . 0 0 1$ $\eta _ { \mathrm { p } } ^ { 2 } = . 2 8$ , with the students rating their cognitive engagement higher than the supervisors did. Feedback role explained $2 8 \%$ of the variance in the perceptions, which indicated a very large effect.

Twenty-seven student respondents commented on their cognitive engagement, characterizing thesis writing as an excellent op. portunity for thm tongage in dee leig though succsive revisions ause there is nothing like finl, complete, and perfect in research' (EEst104). They also read relevant literature closely, "aimed to produce a good-quality thesis' (EEst3-Interview), and reflected on their work regularly. Commenting on her self-regulation, one student said:

I was very conscious of not giving an impression to my supervisor that I was careless in my work. Being independent and self regulated are also skills developed through thesis writing. The more dependent we are, the more trouble we face. (EESt2- Interview)

A second student highlighted the role of the supervisor in promoting independent learning:

My supervisor told me to review the literature and find the solution every time I asked him for help. He said that his motive was not only to help me in thesis writing but alsoto transfer both the research knowledge and skills that would help me in the future. I felt that the hard work I did during that time helped me to work independently. (PSt75)

In contrast, another student felt that supervisors' expectations for student independence from the begining without necessry scaffolding made students \*procrastinate and get anxious when the deadline approached' (ENst2-Interview).

Only a few supervisors commented on students cognitive engagement in their response to the open-ended survey questions. They shared both positive and negative experiences. Two supervisors were proud that \*some students can work beyond your expectation with your support (PS6) and that even students with average GPAs performed well when supported with \*the standard practice of thesis upervision (Ps7). One supervisor was proud that one of his students had one paper published in a peer review journal prior to his thesis defense" (s23). However, some supervisors were frustrated when students took thesis writing indifferently and negl. gently (ss83),did not \*ay attention to feedback and committe the same errors every time (Es8, and looked for ready-made materials" (ESs25).

# 3.1.4. Behavioral engagement

There was a significant main effect of feedback role on the supervisors and the students' perceptions of behavioral engagement $F$ $3 , 5 2 8 ) = 6 9 . 7 7$ $p = . 0 0 1$ $\mathfrak { \eta } _ { \mathtt { p } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 2$ , where the students again rated their behavioral engagement higher than the supervisors did. Feedback role accounted for $1 2 \%$ of the variance.

Eighteen students explicitly commented on behavioral engagement, sharing the experience of taying up the whole night to revise all the graphs as instructed by the supervisor (ENst73), making \*more than twenty attempts to come closer to the expected results" (ENSt74), and taking joint responsibilit \*to selfstudy the process first and teach each other (Pst33). However, some students behavioral engagement was compromised due to insuficiently detaled feedack illegible handwriting, and inabilit to remember some comments, as illustrated by the quotes below:

My supervisor suggested I follow a typical theory or a specific school of thought for my work which I couldn't get then nor til now upon the completion of my research work. (EsSt16)

Sometimes when it was difficult to understand the supervisors handwriting, I removed the sentence. (EESt4-Interview)

Whenever I handed him the draft, he asked me to bring the first draft and pointed out the areas where he suggested correction Sometimes, I forgot his oral comments and did not make the changes he expected. (Esst3-Interview)

The supervisors mainly highlighted students lack of behavioral engagement in their responses to the open-ended survey questions and in the interviews. For example, they complained that their students did not make "any correction after rceiving the feedback" (EES1), disappeared "after getting feedback given to improve their work (EEs12), \*submitted the same draft carelessly without following any suggestions (s15), igored the suggestions for six times (97), and did not mee the deadlines (ENs9). There were only a few positive comments. For example, a supervisor appreciated a student's perseverance:

One of my students failed in his first threeattempts to get the desired product during his experiments. But he did not give up. He carried out the experiments repeatedly, taking all precautions, and ultimately became successful in preparing the desired compound. (PS3)

In general, the supervisors' comments portrayed students' behavioral engagement with supervisory feedback as inadequate and unsatisfactory.

# 3.2. Perceptions of student engagement with supervisory feedback across disciplines

Table 3 presents the descriptive statistics for the supervisors and students' perceptions of student engagement with supervisory feedback by discipline.

The two-way ANoVA revealed a non-significant main effect of discipline on perceptions of positive affect, $F ( 3 , 5 2 8 ) = 0 . 2 2 , p = . 8 8 ,$ $\boldsymbol \eta _ { \mathrm { p } } ^ { 2 } = . 0 0 1 )$ , but a significant main effect was found for negative affect, $F ( 3 , 5 2 8 ) = 6 . 2 7$ $p = . 0 0 1$ $\boldsymbol \eta _ { \mathsf { p } } ^ { 2 } = . 0 3$ Discipline explained only ${ } ^ { 3 \% }$ of the variance in negative affect. Bonferroni post hoc tes revealed significant differences between English education and physics $( p = . 0 0 1$ $d = 0 . 5 4 \AA$ , English studies and physics $( p = . 0 0 1$ $d = 0 . 6 1 { \dot { } }$ , and engineering and physics $( p = . 0 1$ $d = 0 . 2 6 )$ . Corroborating the quantitative results, higher proportions of participants from English education $( 6 1 \% )$ , English studies $( 6 5 \% )$ , and engineering $( 4 5 \% )$ than from physics $( 3 5 \% )$ commented on students' negative affect, associating it with supervisor-, student- and institutionrelated factors. While English education and English studies participants attributed their negative afect mostly to supervisor- and student-related factors, those in physics and engineering pointed to institutional issues (eg., limited reading, lab and financial resources).

Discipline had a significant main effect on the perceptions of cognitive engagement, $F ( 3 , 5 2 8 ) = 7 . 5 2 , p = . 0 0 1 , \mathfrak { \eta } _ { \mathrm { p } } ^ { 2 } = . 0 4 ,$ with the variable explaining $4 \%$ of the variance. Bonferroni post hoc tests identified a significant difference between physics and English studies $( p = . 0 1$ $d = 0 . 3 3 { \mathrm { ~ } }$ , with physics respondents rating student engagement higher than their counterparts in English studies. The qualitative data corroborated the quantitative paterns. While the physics supervisors and students shared positive cases of cognitive engagement (e.g, producing excellnt work, publishing in a pr-reviewed journal, working beyond expectations, learning independently, and developing various skill), their counterparts in English studies remembered examples of inadequate cognitive engagement (e.g., plagiarism, premature submission, and limited understanding of research).

Discipline also had a significant main effect on perceptions of behavioral engagement, $F ( 3 , 5 3 5 ) = 6 . 3 9$ $p = . 0 0 1$ 3 $\boldsymbol \eta _ { \mathsf { p } } ^ { 2 } = . 0 4 )$ , accounting for $4 \%$ of the variance. Post hoc tests located significant differences between physics and English studies $( p = . 0 2$ $d = 0 . 3 7 \mathrm { . }$ and between engineering and English studies $\left( p = . 0 2 \right.$ $d = 0 . 3 3 )$ . The qualitative data showed that, unlike physics and engineering participants, English studies supervisors highlighted students' lack of seriousness toward feedback and the repetition of the same mistakes.

3.3. Interaction between supervisors' and students' perceptions and disciplinary background

Table 4 presents the descriptive statistics for perceptions of student engagement by discipline and feedback role.

# 3.3.1. Affective engagement

The interaction between feedback role and discipline in perceptions of negative affect was non-significant, $F ( 3 , 5 2 8 ) = 2 . 4 1$ $p =$ .06, $\boldsymbol \eta _ { \mathsf { p } } ^ { 2 } = . 0 1$ . However, the role/discipline interaction was significant for perceptions of positive affect, $F ( 3 , 5 2 8 ) = 3 . 5 3 , p = . 0 2 , \mathfrak { \eta } _ { \mathtt { p } } ^ { 2 } =$ .02, though the efect size was small. As can be seen in Fig. 1 and confirmed by follow-up analyses, when discipline was the cond. tioning factor, the supervisors rated positive affect significantly lower than the students did in each discipline: English education $\left( p = \right.$ .001, $d = 1 . 5 5$ , English studies $( p = . 0 0 1$ $d = 1 . 2 5$ , physics $( p = . 0 1$ 3 $d = 0 . 5 7 $ , and engineering $( p = . 0 2$ $d = 0 . 6 0 $ . The effect sizes ranged from medium to large. When feedback role was the conditioning factor, no significant cross-disciplinary differences were observed in supervisors perctions. However, significant differences i students perctions were found betwen English education and physics $( p = . 0 3$ $d = 0 . 3 1 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ), English education and engineering $( p = . 0 3$ $d = 0 . 2 8 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } }$ , and English studies and engineering $\textstyle ( p = . 0 4 .$ $d = 0 . 2 6$ , with students from the soft disciplines rating their positive afect higher than their counterpart from the hard disciplines. As indicated by Cohen's $d$ values, the effects were small.

Sizeable proportions of students from all the disciplines (English education $= 2 3$ , English studies $= 2 8$ physics $= 3 0$ , and engineering $scriptstyle = 3 0$ ) shared positive experiences in response to the open-ended survey questions. The following quotes are some examples:

My supervisor created a homely and friendly environment which helped me to do my work so easily. She treated me like her daughter and led me accordingly to write my thesis, which I wil always remember because we can't find every supervisor like she is. (EESt10)

I have had a very comfortable time with my supervisor. His supervision, guidance, constructive criticism, and the way he motivated me to undertake research work is the best thing that ever happened to me. (Esst14)

My supervisor always gave me enough time to work on my work. He always made positive comments and even helped to complete my defense presentation. (ENSt33)

My supervisor said I have done work beyond his expectations and openly praised my work. Ifeel happy about it. (PSt56)

# 3.3.2. Cognitive engagement

The interaction between feedback role and discipline on the perceptions of cognitive engagement was significant, $F ( 3 , 5 2 8 ) = 6 . 1 4$ $p = . 0 0 1$ 3 $\mathfrak { n } _ { \mathtt { p } } ^ { 2 } = . 0 3$ Fig. 2 plots the interaction patterns. With discipline as the conditioning factor, the supervisors rated cognitive engagement consistently lower than the students did in all disciplines: English education $( p = . 0 0 1$ $d = 2 . 3 4 )$ , English studies $( p = . 0 0 1$ $d = 1 . 2 7 $ , physics $( p = . 0 0 1$ $d = 1 . 4 0 $ , and engineering $( p = . 0 0 1$ 3 $d = 1 . 0 1 \dot { }$ . The effects were large in all cases. When feedback role was the conditioning factor, significant differences in supervisors perceptions were found between physics and English education $( p = . 0 0 1$ $d = 1 . 2 \AA$ , physics and English studies $\left( p = . 0 3 \right.$ $d = 0 . 5 8 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } }$ , and engineering and English education $( \boldsymbol { p } = . 0 0 3$ $d =$ 0.94). Supervisors from the hard disciplines rated students' cognitive engagement markedly higher than thir counterpart from the soft disciplines, with medium to large effct sizes. Students' perceptions of cognitive engagement differed significantly between physics and English studies $( p = . 0 0 3$ $d = 0 . 3 1$ ) and between physics and engineering ( $\begin{array} { r } { p = . 0 0 3 } \end{array}$ $d = 0 . 3 1$ ), with physics students rating their cognitive engagement higher than their counterparts in English studies or engineering.

Responses to the open-ended survey questions revealed that whil supervisors in physics and engineering tended to comment on students' cognitive engagement positively, their ounterparts in English education and Englishstudies often emphasized the lack of such engagement, as illustrated in the following quotes:

Sometimes students bring appropriate thinking about the academic problem that I am not aware of or bring better ideas than myself. (PS27)

I often find them in a hurry, though they might not have done anything in their thesis. (EsS5)

Well in general, students seem to concentrate more on getting through the undertaking as early as possible than on taking it as an opportunity for learning. (EES13)

Consistent with the quantitative results reported above, physics students reported that they learned various software applications (e.g, Latex, GIs, Matlab, gnu plot, python, Aladin) individuall or through group interaction, had a great time learning new things, tried their best to solve problems before seeking supervisory support, enjoyed deep involvement in content, and experienced different aspects of research. For example, a student proudly related,

Writing a thesis was a productive time for me that I thoroughly enjoyed... efore writing the first draft of my thesis, I read several pertinent materials, synthesized important materials on the bas f relevant categories, and comprehended all the terms and terminologies that I will be penning in my thesis. Therefore, writing the first draft was easier for me. (PSt67)

Some physics students also appreciated their engagement being supported by their supervisors, who were available when needed. :ovided guidance in both labs and fieldwork, motivated them for improvement instead of picking on problems, facilitated their access relevant resources, and helped them make sense of their findings. As an example, a student shared the following experience.

I was unable to speak a word when I was presenting my findings in front of all. I just showed the slides, and my professor explained all the slides for me so that I understood how to explain my results. (PSt23)

Fig. 2. Interaction between feedback role and discipline on perceptions of cognitive engagement.

Similarly, many engineering students also appreciated the learning opportunitie offered by thesis writing and the support from their supervisors. However, quite a few belied that the quality of their reearch was compromised by limited acesto resource, ack of enough time to invest i thesis writing due to their job-related responsibilities, and mismatches between supervisors and students research interests.

# 3.3.3. Behavioral engagement

The interaction between feedback role and discipline was significant for perceptions of behavioral engagement, $F ( 3 , 5 2 8 ) = 5 . 0 3$ $p = . 0 0 2$ $\mathfrak { \eta } _ { \mathtt { p } } ^ { 2 } = . 0 3$ (see Fig. 3 for the interaction patterns). When discipline was the conditioning factor, the supervisors rated behavioral engagement significantly lower than the students did in all four disciplines: English education $( p = . 0 0 1$ $d = 1 . 5 9$ ), English studies $( p = . 0 0 1$ $d = 0 . 6 4 \AA$ , physics $( p = . 0 1$ $d = 0 . 5 7 $ , and engineering $( p = . 0 0 1$ $d = 0 . 8 8 \mathrm { \AA }$ . When feedback role was held constant, there were no significant cross-disciplinary differences in students' perceptions of behavioral engagement but larg or medium differences in supervisors' perceptions between English studies and English education $( p = . 0 0 1$ $d = 0 . 5 6$ , physics and English education $( p = . 0 0 1$ $d = 1 . 2 8 { \dot { } }$ , physics and English studies $( p = . 0 1$ $d = 0 . 6 1$ ), and engineering and English education $( p = . 0 1$ $d = 0 . 7 6$ . The hard-discipline supervisors rated behavioral engagement markedly higher than their soft-discipline counterparts did.

In responding to the open-ended survey questions, physics supervisors tended to emphasize students satisfactory behavioral engagement, but English education supervisors recalled students' suboptimal behavioral engagement, as ilustrated by the following examples:

Some students can work beyond your expectation when you give your time and provide guidelines. (PS4)

A large group of students neither listen to feedback nor pay attention to it. (EES7).

# 4. Discussion

# 4.1. Do supervisors and students differ in their perceptions?

The findings indicated that the supervisors and the students held significantly different perceptions of student engagement in all hree dimensions (i. affctive, coive, and behavioral, with th ltter rating ther engagmet consistentl higher or les ngative than the former did.

The discrepancies between the supervisors' and the students' perceptions of affctive engagement appeared to be perspectival. In line with previous literature, the students atributed ther positie emotions to suportive, encouraging, and inspiring supervisors who showed a geuine interest in their work, the develoment of their cademic competence, and their cces to reources (u et al., 2019; Skinner & Pitzer, 2012). The supervisors, in general, tended to link negative affect to student-related factors such as negative dis positions, low research commitment, aversion to multipl revisions, and little understanding of the value of research. However, the students atributed their negative emotions to less than optimal supervisor-student relationships, expressly negative and overly judgmental feedback comments, and inconducive research environments, in line with the extant iterature (Skiner & Pitzer, 2012) Some students confided that they were subject to humiliation in interactions with their supervisors or other research commitee members. Such upsetting comments reulted in their plummetig slf-confidence, demotivation, and negative atitudes toward tesis writing (Henderson et al., 2019). The supervisors in our study appeared to be unaware of such unintended consequences, unlike academics in previous studies (e.g., Hyland & Hyland, 2001; Hyland & Hyland, 2019).

![](img/cf804b3dcd497e13ccb9a88214d7de4e9dadba2a49f2684e6c324033bc54e8a2.jpg)  
Fig. 3. Interaction between feedback role and discipline on perceptions of behavioral engagement.

The students, as a group, believed that they had a higher level of cognitive engagement with supervisory feedback than their supervisors perceived. They also indicated a higher level of behavioral engagement than their supervisors did. They reported that they persisted in the face of difficulties, self-regulated their learning, appreciated learning opportunities (Finn & Zimmer, 2012), and attended to meaningful and relevant fedback (Beaumont et al., 2011). The supervisors, by contrast, were les positive. Previous research also suggested that, in teachers' view, students tended to ignore feedback (Beaumont et al., 2011), did not engage with feedback as expected (Han & Hyland, 2019), or engaged with feedback passively (Ali et al., 2018).

Notably, both the supervisors and the students acknowledged inadequate cognitive and behavioral engagement. However, while the supervisors atributed inadequate engagement to student-related factors such as their limited understanding of research as an activity, focus on completion rather than learning and insufficient academic literacy (Neupane Bastola & Hu, 2023), the students identified thr different antednts: themelve (.., their rerh kowlge and time at their disosal), supervisor (.e, unclear feedback and limited support), and institution (ie, limited aes to resources). Four explanations can be offeed for the diverging perceptions. First, the supervisors' perceptions appeared to be based on their general observations because they tended to draw examples from students that they supervised over the years. In contrst thestudents talked about their own experiences. The supervisors generalizations might have overlooked individual students' endeavors to engage with supervisory feedback Second, some supervisors appeared to asume that students aproached thesis writing like themselves, although it was th first time for the latte to undertake such an arduous writing task. Therefore students might not have been cognitively prepared to met their supervisors' expectatins. It should be noted that students experienced greater cognitive engagement with supervisory feedback given by caring, motivating, and inspiring supervisors who were competent and showed a genuine interest in their work (Neupane Bastola & Hu, 2023; Paran et al. 2017). Third, while the supervisors aeared to gauge students' cognitive and behavioral engagement in terms of observable revision efforts and changes in writing quality, the students might have considered active inaction i.e, rejection of comments afer careful consideration or inability to make improvements due to lack of support or resource access as engagement (Xu, 2017). In this regad, most supervisors seemed to subscribe to a behavioral, deficit perspective on engagement (blaming the students themselves for insufficient engagement), whereas many students took a broader perspective recognizing the role of personal and sociocultural factors (Kahu, 2013; McMahon & Portell, 2004) inll, self-presentation bias, namely "a tendency of individuals to present themselves and their practices in a favorable way' (Kopcha & Sullivan, 2007, p. 628), might have some impact on the students' views.

# 4.2. Do supervisors' and students' perceptions vary across disciplines?

Significant crossdisciplinary variations were observed in the supervisors' and the students' perceptions of negative affect, cognitive engagement, and behavioral engagement, coroborating the findings of previous studies (Heerden et al., 2017; Neupane Bastola & Hu, 2021a; Winstone & Carless 2020). Specificall, physics supervisors and students perceived a lower level of negative affect and a higher level of cognitive and behavioral engagement in students than their counterparts in English education, English studies, and/or engineering did. Four factors could explain these findings. First, writing a thesis was optional in physics and only competent students in term of GPA) were llowed to writ a thesis. Therefore, those opting for thesis must have been motivated as well as willing and able to take challenge, as suggested in the extant literature (Wagener, 2018). Second, interviews with physics supervisors and students revealed good alignment betwen supervisors' and students' research interests, which might have contributed to ashared understanding (of purposes, goals, expectations, roles, and responsiblities) and lowered negatie emotions (Breunig & Penner, 2016). Third, there was usually a cllborative learning environment in physics (Byers et al., 2017), which could provide students with mutual support and reduce negative emotionalit. Finall, lower negative affect experienced by physics students might also have contributed to their higher cognitive and behavioral engagement (Wagener, 2018; Zheng et al., 2020). Converely, the greater negative affct and the lower cognitive and behavioral engagement perceived by English studies and/or English education participants could also be plausibly atributed to disciplinary characteristics and the rlatively low academic competence of students (Neupane Bastola & Hu, 2021b) in these disciplines at the focal universty. Unlike physics and engineering, where research is primarily collaborative, English studies and English education as knower-oriented disciplines require students to work independently, develop individual understanding and acquire a personal voice (Becher, 1994; Heerden et al., 2017). The greater autonomy expected by su. pervisors, coupled with inadequate self-regulated learning capacities and insufficiently developed academic literacy in the students, would be more likely to invoke negative emotions and detract from cognitive and behavioral engagement (Wagener, 2018; Zheng et al., 2020).

4.3. Do disciplinary background and feedback role jointly affect perceptions of student engagement?

Several interaction effcts between disciplinary background and feedback role were found on perceptions of student engagement with supervisory fedack First although the superviors from the four disciplines dd not dfer in their erctions of positie affect, significant cross-disciplinary iferences were found in students' perceptions, with students from soft disciplines rating their positive affect higher than those from hard disciplines. The observed interaction effct could be explained by the eforts that students made to obtain supervisory feedback and the opportunities they had to interact with their supervisors. Students from the soft discipline ., English education and English studies) reported less frequent and les regular contact with their supervisors compared to their counterpart from the hard disciplines (i.e, physics and engineering). The former also reported having to take greater intiative in seeking supervisory support and feback, manage their study progres independentl, and troubleshoot isues with minimal supervisory guidance between intermittent meetings. In contrast, physics students highlighted more structured and frequent interactions, such as regular progress meetings. These disciplinary differences could explain why soft-discipline students scored markedly higher than their hard-discipline counterparts for two questionnair items asessing positiveaffect: I look forward to feedback from my supervisor' and "I actively approach my supervisor for feedback on my thesis'. The qualitative results were consistent with these quantitatie pattns, revealing that students in the soft discilines placed grater value n supervisory fdback due to its relative scarcity and had to seek it more proactively, compared with students in the hard disciplines.

Second, while smaller cros-disciplinary differences were located in the students' perceptions of cognitive engagement, the su. pervisors from the four disciplines differed markedly in their perceptions. Similar patterns were also found for perceptions of behavioral engagement Soft-discipline supervisors rated students lower on cognitive and behavioral engagement than hard-disipline supervisors did. These variations could have stemmed from students' varying academic literacy skill and supervisors' differing support. Frst soft-discipline students at the focal university tended to have lower academic litracy skill, compared with their hard discipline counterparts (Neupane Bastola & Hu, 2021b, 2023). Given that language and content are closely intertwined in soft dis ciplines (Hu & Lei, 2015), their nadequate literacy kills could have compromised their cognitive and behavioral engagement. Second, compared to hard-discipline supervisors, sft-discipline supervisors were overcommtted did not meet their supervisee regularly, had lower research productivity, and had to supervise theses not aligned with their research interests (Neupane Bastola & Hu, 2021a). These contextual particularities would have made it more difficult for them to provide constructive feedack to promote students engagement. In contrast, feback from productive supervisors with matching research interests and regular supervisor-supervisee communication were more likely to induce hard-discipline students' cognitive and behavioral engagement (Gunn, 2014; Neupane Bastola & Hu, 2021a, 2023). Further research on discipline-specific supervision norms could enrich our understanding of potential differences in research training experiences.

# 5. Conclusion and implications

This study identified significant differences between supervisors' and students' perceptions of student engagement with supervisory feedback in all three dimensions. Acros the four disciplines, the students consistently rated their positive affect, cognitive engagement and behavioral engagement higher and their negative afect lower than the supervisors did. The participants atributed these differences to various supervior, student, and institution-related factors. Significant cross-dsciplinary variations were also observed in supervisors' and students perceptions of negative afect, cognitive engagement, and behavioral engagement. Furthermore, disciplinary background and feedback role interacted to shape perceptions of positive affect, cognitive engagement and behavioral engagement. These findings have several implications.

First, students are able to tell whether and why they are or are not engaged with supervisory fedback, and supervisors need to monitor the "engagement temperature" of their supervises and act accordingly (McFadden & Munns, 2002). The major purpose of supervisory feedback i to promote students' leaning and development Therefore, supervisors need to be mindful and reflective on their supervisory practices (i.., nature and language of fedack, interpersonal relations, availability for consultation, and respect), with due attention to students affective needs. Although a certain level of negative afect toward supervisory feedback might be inevitable because of its very nature, overly negative fedback that demotivates, discourages, and underestimates students can and should be avoided.

Second, it is natural for supervisors to feel frustrated when they se limited commitment by students. However, it is unfair to hold a deficit view of engagement by focusing only on the behavioral aspect and placing the sole responsibility of engagement/commitment on students. It should be noted that although improvements ften follow from behavioral and cognitive engagement, affet is likely to mediate behavioral and cognitive engagement (Skinner & Pizer, 2012). Therefore, it is necessary to view student engagement as a psycho-social proces influenced by a wide range of individual, interpersonal and insttional factors (Kahu, 2013; Mann, 2001; Zheng et al., 2020). Students also need to undersand that supervisors want them to engage with thesis writing or supervisory fedback for their own development (Han & Hyland, 2019), rather than giving them a "burden'. They need to be agentive in learning (Zepke, 2017). In this regard, students' own expectations, background, and personality can profoundly influence the relationship that they develop with their supervisors and the nature of support that they receive (Kahu, 2013; Zepke, 2017). Therefore, it is necessary to empathize with and take into consideration the sociocultural conditions that supervisors and students are embedded in, working toward removing \*the separation between 'them', the students, and us the academics" (Mann, 2001, p. 17).

Third, engagement is a dialectical and dialogic proces between supervisors and students in a shared space and can be an opportunity of personal transformation for both supervisors and students. However, only supervisors who are engaged in their transformation through the promotion of understanding can lead students down the path (Freire, 1998; McMahon & Portell, 2004) Productive and authentic relationships between supervisors and students contribute to engagement because engagement is a process rather than a product (McFadden & Munns, 2002). Therefore, the voices f supervisors and students are equally important. Finall, institutions should strive to support learning by optimizing student engagement (Zepke, 2017). Doing so requires helping students develop their academic competence and literacy skill through intitution-organized courses that ffectively cater to students' disci plinary needs, and offring welldesigned professional development programs to supervisors that promote best supervisory practices (Neupane Bastola & Hu, 2023).

Our study has contrbuted to a growing understanding of how supervisors and students perceive engagement with supervisory feedback. The findings, however, should be considered along with the limitations of the study. First,self-rport data collected through semi-structured interviews and open-ended questions in questionnaires might have elicited perceptions abstracted from experiences and consequently biased. Future researchers might conduct text-based interviews to explore context-specific perceptions and practices. Second, we did not examine or assess students' actual academic literacy It would be interesting to explore how students' level of academic literacy may impact their engagement with fedback. Third, our study did not track how student engagement contributed to improvements in their writing. Future research could examine various drafts produced by students to document the specific ways in which student engagement with supervisory feedback can enhance or inhibit the development of their academic writing skill.
