Tertiary-level English as a foreign language (EFL) learners in Taiwan are often required to read English-medium textbooks in their disciplinary courses. In science and engineering, it is a common practice for teachers to assign students English text but lecture in the local language, Chinese. In this study, we provided a situated picture of how these students interact with the text in their disciplinary context by triangulating multiple knowledge sources available to them. This includes analysis of the subject textbook in L2 (English), lectures in L1 (Chinese), and artifacts produced in the class, such as syllabus, exam sheets, and students’ notes. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate the students’ and an instructor’s perceptions of the role of these sources and their interrelationships. The findings reveal that students exploited various meaning-making resources to comprehend the ideas covered in the textbook. In addition, the instructor’s explanation of the teaching materials, homework problem sets, and exam questions all proved to be important and interconnected resources that students rely on in their reading practices. Notably, problem sets and equations captured the students’ attention while reading the textbook. We discuss the role of problem sets in scientific textbooks and suggest implications for further research.

# 1. Introduction

Textbooks in the fields of science and engineering are considered cognitively demanding for readers because of their use of technical terms and specialized grammar (Biber, 2006; Fang, 2006; Halliday and Martin, 1993; Lemke, 1998). Science majors and engineering majors around the world, however, often need to decipher such materials written in their second language (L2), English, in their disciplinary courses, especially in the introductory courses such as Calculus, Fundamental Physics, and General Chemistry. Tertiary-level learners in Taiwan have reported that reading English-medium textbooks demands more effort than reading Chinese textbooks and that it is a skill most needed yet inadequately taught (Liu et al., 2011). Other studies have also pointed out that English language learners found the textbooks used in their academic disciplines more difficult than general English reading (Atai and Hejazi, 2019; Hakuta et al., 2013; Pecorari et al., 2012). In light of this, many studies in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) seek to analyze textbooks in terms of their linguistic features, such as vocabulary frequency (Hsu, 2014; Huang and Tsou, 2013; Quero and Coxhead, 2018) and lexico-grammatical patterns (Biber et al., 2004). These studies have identified linguistic features of disciplinary textbooks, yet the investigated texts are treated as operating in a vacuum, with little attention put on how classroom practice and teacher expectations affect student readers’ purposes and choices, and the role the students ascribe to the course textbooks and their content. Reading, as Haas (1994) points out, is a dynamic activity that involves social interactions and goes beyond the Simple View of Reading with word recognition and language comprehension. It is a situated activity because “authors create texts and readers read texts in a complex of social relationships, motivated by goals sanctioned (or not) by the surrounding culture” (Haas, 1994, p. 44).

The act of reading disciplinary textbooks is an especially intricate one, since textbook content is not confined to the printed text, but shows up as well in the class handouts, lecture slides, the instructor’s oral explanations of the text, and in homework assignments, for example. Serving as a medium of instruction whose value to learners can be understood only in light of this role within that larger context, course textbooks stand as a highly specialized genre. One compelling reason that textbooks deserve to be considered in light of such contextual factors is that students’ reading behaviors of these textbooks are largely influenced by the course design and the instructor. These students read with a view to extracting textual knowledge that best helps them succeed in the course. Syllabi and exams dictate which parts of the textbook need extra attention. Throughout the class sessions, instructors’ selection and explanation of the text shape how students make meaning from the textbook content. Luke et al. (1989) view the textbooks in classroom settings as the locus of information exchange and state that assessments, exams, and daily reinforcement of ‘correct’ student responses collectively form a specific way to interpret the text. For many science and engineering students, the locus of information exchange is often represented not only through linguistic modes, but also through extra-linguistic modes such as formulae and equations found in the text and exams. However, for undergraduate students in Taiwan, comprehending this information exchange is further complicated by the cooccurrence of two languages in their learning context, which brings us to the second reason why contextual factors surrounding textbooks should also be considered.

As Jordan (1997) points out, EAP takes places in a variety of school settings, ranging from learning contexts in Englishspeaking countries to English-medium instructions programs in non-English-speaking countries. These latter countries may have English as an official/second language (ESL) or a Foreign Language (EFL). However, in many EFL settings a common practice of college teachers is to assign students English reading materials but lecture in the local language. In these settings, both the instructor and students have the first language (L1) at their disposal in teaching or learning from the English-written textbook, which Pecorari et al. (2012) call “parallel language contexts.” This is typical for Taiwanese undergraduate classrooms, with L2 (English) in written form and L1 (Mandarin) in spoken form, a pattern observed in many other EFL settings elsewhere as well (Airey, 2009; Kaewpet, 2009; Malmström et al., 2017; Me-zek et al., 2015). Although the Taiwanese government launched “The Program on Bilingual Education for Students in College” with the aim of designating 30 universities as flagship bilingual institutions by 2030, the data from 2021 reveals that only $4 . 5 5 \%$ of undergraduate courses were delivered in English as a Medium of Instruction (EMI), and the majority of undergraduate courses are still taught in the local language (Ministry of Education, 2021).

In the study context of Taiwan, English plays a vital role in shaping students’ success within their respective majors. This influence is particularly profound due to the widespread adoption of English textbooks by college professors in various specialized fields. While the use of textbooks sparks debates between proponents and opponents, reflecting the debate of the pro-textbook and anti-textbook views (Zare-ee & Hejazi, 2018), it remains a pervasive practice. One of the motivations behind this practice in Taiwan is to enhance students’ reading skills as a beneficial side effect (Huang, 2006; Hung and Good, 2016). Another motivation, from the perspective of the broader context of EAP, can be attributed to the overarching impact of globalization on universities, which has entailed that proficiency in English and engagement in English-medium environments can bring substantial economic advantages (Ding and Bruce, 2017). In Taiwan, programs designed to help students develop English academic skills go by different names, such as English for Specific Purposes (ESP) or EAP courses. Despite the growing number of such courses across different universities, there is considerable divergence in both administrative structures and requirements. Some universities categorize these courses under general education, while others integrate them at the departmental level as mandatory components for students of particular majors (Kao, 2019). As a result, the status of EAP in Taiwan’s higher education institutions is somewhat ambiguous, occupying a position between being a “support service” and being a “research-informed academic field of study,” as discussed by Ding and Bruce (2017, p. 4).

In parallel language contexts like Taiwan, where both English and the local lingua franca are used in learners’ disciplinary context, a pertinent question arises: how would students’ reading practices be influenced by the use of two languages? Since current literature puts more emphasis on analyzing the isolated text, little is known about how readers put together the meaning-making resources available to achieve their purpose in parallel language contexts. Even if we turn to the studies investigating how students read academic text, the center of discussion has been ESL students (Adamson, 1990; Fang, 2006; Lee and Spratley, 2010) or EFL students in English-medium instruction programs (Lee et al., 2021; Tang, 2021; Çoban and Razı, 2022). Çoban and Razı (2022), for example, researched the metacognitive reading strategies used by Turkish students in EMI contexts. They found students predominantly employ analytic strategies such as understanding the meaning of key words or reviewing for better comprehension. While this study provides some insights into reading strategies that could be relevant for the parallel language contexts, it is unclear to what extent the findings can be applied to understanding students’ reading of

English textbooks for settings where course lectures are conducted in the local L1. A few exceptions in the literature have addressed academic reading in such parallel language environments (Pecorari et al., 2012; Ward, 2001), but they rely heavily on questionnaires and offer little empirical description or qualitative account of the setting and its role in how students cope with the textbook content.

Therefore, this study aims to provide a richer, situated picture of how EAP students interact with the text in their disciplinary context by triangulating multiple knowledge sources available to them as part of the setting for their textbook reading and their goals for the course. This will include analysis of the subject textbook in L2 (English), lectures in L1 (Chinese), and artifacts produced in the class, such as syllabus, exam sheets, and students’ notes. Also, the role of these sources and their inter-relations as perceived by students and an instructor will be investigated through semi-structured interviews. It is through connecting the textbook with the communicative events and artifacts surrounding it and through piecing together the meaning-making resources available to readers in both languages and across different communication channels, we argue, that the dynamic nature of reading English for academic purposes can be understood. In what follows, we first review relevant studies on disciplinary textbook reading. Then, drawing upon literature from translanguaging and multiliteracies research, we investigate the various meaning-making resources that may influence the role students ascribe to their textbooks, adopting a mixed-methods approach. Data were collected in a university engineering course, Mechanics of Materials. Combining different sources of data, we seek to answer two key questions:

(1) What are the meaning-making resources and their interrelations available for Taiwanese students to learn and understand the content of the textbook in the disciplinary course?   
(2) How do the student readers make use of the textbook and deploy the network of related resources in this situated setting to construe meaning from the textbook?

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Disciplinary textbooks in EAP literature

Textbooks play a central role in the knowledge construction in a discipline. Students who are English language learners rely on them to gain expertise in the disciplinary community and develop academic English. Current EAP studies on disciplinary textbooks have mainly centered the discussions on analyzing two aspects: (a) lexico-grammatical features such as frequent vocabulary and lexical bundles (b) rhetorical moves and organizations. Among the studies investigating the lexicogrammatical aspects of subject textbooks, a substantial proportion of them are corpus-informed. There are vocabulary lists targeting specific disciplines such as medical education (Quero and Coxhead, 2018), engineering (Hsu, 2014; Huang and Tsou, 2013), and business (Hsu, 2011). Other studies examine the multiword constructions in school texts of tertiary education, comparing the textbooks designed for EAP language learning with introductory-level textbooks in subject fields such as business and engineering (Chen, 2010; Wood and Appel, 2014). Biber et al. (2004) identify the lexical bundles frequently used in university textbooks in America across six disciplines, including education, engineering, natural science, business, social science, and humanities. Collecting data from four different schools, they compare the written lexical bundles with the spoken ones used in classroom teaching.

The second type of research analyzing the linguistic features of disciplinary textbooks aspect of analysis focuses on their rhetorical structures. Love (1991) studied the discourse features of introductory geology textbooks, uncovering the cognitive model embedded in the pedagogical discourseda process–product cycle manifested through the linguistic and structural organization. Parodi (2010, 2014) analyzed 126 university textbooks from four disciplines for the rhetorical moves in these academic Spanish texts. Although the textbooks in his study are written in Spanish, Parodi’s framework is commonly cited in EAP literature on the textbook genre (Bondi, 2016; Li et al., 2020; Shahab et al., 2020). Examining the rhetorical organization of the entire textbook content on a macro-level, he concludes that the way academic textbooks are organized can be best summarized by a framework with three fundamental rhetorical moves: (a) Preambledintroducing thematic organization of the textbook and reader orientation (b) Conceptualization and Exercisingdpresenting key concepts with supplementary examples and practices–and (c) Corollarydrevealing solutions and answers to the practice problems, and ending the books with appendices, glossary, or bibliography.

Up to this point, the studies have narrowed to textual analysis of disciplinary textbooks. Pedagogically speaking, understanding the linguistic features of textbooks in different academic fields certainly helps to inform the design of EAP teaching materials, but researchers and practitioners would not meet the needs of EAP learners if students’ reading practices and their perceptions of the role of textbooks are excluded from the discussion. A select few studies noticed such a gap and shed light on student’s reading of textbooks in a second language. Ward (2001) surveyed undergraduate engineering students in Thailand on their habits and views toward reading subject textbooks written in English. Pecorari et al. (2012) conducted a larger scale survey on Swedish university students across six different disciplines to uncover their behaviors and attitudes toward reading English subject textbooks. Both studies bring L2 readers in parallel language environments center stage, but show somewhat different results regarding students’ reading practices. While the subjects in Ward’s study are reported to avoid the prose and focus selectively on the examples in the textbook, their counterparts in the survey of Pecorari et al. engage with most parts of the assigned reading in the course, although resources other than textbooks such as lecture notes and class meetings are deemed more helpful by the students.

These questionnaire-based studies offer a glimpse of reading practices of a specific group of EAP readers. However, since how students read their textbooks in parallel language environments remains understudied in the literature, it is difficult to draw implications for pedagogy without extensive description of the disciplinary contexts. Additionally, although the subjects in both studies interact with at least two languages in parallel in their disciplinary course, the role of L1 and how that contributes to understanding the English-medium textbook is minimized. The uniqueness of a parallel language environment calls, therefore, for a dynamic view of literacy that takes into account the complex set of resources and interactions between L1 and L2 that shape the context of academic reading.

# 2.2. Reading as a dynamic activitydtranslanguaging perspectives

The monolingual view of literacy leads one to overlook the complex interplay between different languages and forms of communication. Rejecting this traditional view of literacy, translanguaging acknowledges that “spoken and written literacies are always intertwined and shifting, surrounded by other modes in mutual elaboration” (García and Kleifgen, 2020, p. 558). This alternative view is better suited to capturing the communicative needs and practices of EAP readers in parallel language environment, with the purposes of “understanding language and communication in which its multilingual, multimodal and multicultural nature is foregrounded” (Baker, 2021, p. 24). Translanguaging differs from codeswitching or code mixing in that it recognizes the linked nature of different modes of communicationdincluding listening, speaking, reading and writing (Vaish and Subhan, 2015). In other words, when learners read in their L2 and speak in their L1, they are not simply switching from one language system to another, nor are they just mixing different communicative modes. From a dynamic perspective such as translanguaging, the variations of languages or modes are all integral to the meaning-making process. As García (2020) argues, “the act of reading does not depend on the language of the written text .. Rather, the act of reading is about readers assembling all their meaning-making resources and acting on them to read themselves” (p. 557). In this sense, translanguaging serves as a fitting approach for the present study investigating the role of textbook reading in a classroom where the English written text is surrounded by spoken discourse mixed with Chinese.

# 2.3. Reading as a dynamic activity d from multiliteracies perspectives

A pedagogy of multiliteracies long ago distinguished itself from the traditional view of literacy by embracing textual multiplicity. Proposed by the New London Group (2000), this approach acknowledges the diversity of texts and modes of communication. While translanguaging transcends the limitations between different languages and forms of communication, multiliteracies extends the concept further and treats the act of reading as a communicative event encompassing all the meaning-making modes, both the linguistic and extra-linguistic ones such as visual, gestural, spatial, and multimodal representations. Essentially, the New London Group uses the term “Design” to describe the dynamic process of meaning-making, which consists of three aspects: Available Designs, Designing, and The Redesigned. Taken together, these three elements underscore that meaning-making is “not something governed by static rules” (p.20).

Among the three elements they identified, Available Designs are especially relevant to this study. The term refers to the available resources for meaning-making, including for example the linguistic design, visual design, audio design, and spatial design. In other words, the non-verbal modes of representations share an equally important role and should also be incorporated in the investigation of meaning–making processes. Although it is not the intention of this paper to discuss the multiple modes of representation in student readers’ construal of meaning from the textbook in an exhaustive manner, it is crucial for our purposes to note that the nature of scientific discourse is multimodal. From our pilot investigation based on class observations of science courses such as Fundamental Physics at a research university in Taiwan, it was found that when a learner tries to make use of the textbook to understand a scientific concept in their discipline, they rely heavily on mathematical equations and Greek symbols. Previous research has also emphasized the significance of both prose and extralinguistic modes for expert readers (Shanahan et al., 2011; Trevelyan, 2014). Therefore, the notion of including not only linguistic representations but also the extra-linguistic representations helps to illuminate our investigation of what shapes textbook reading. However, given the scope of this paper, we focus our consideration of extra-linguistic modes to one particular type, the mathematical representations.

# 3. Methods

Based on the premise that the act of reading is dynamic and crosses boundaries of languages and of modes of communication, we gather data by incorporating all the potential meaning-making resources available to the students that relate to the content of the disciplinary textbook.

# 3.1. The context

Data from diverse sources were gathered during a semester-long university engineering course, which is a mandatory offering in the Department of Civil Engineering. The class comprised 49 students, primarily sophomores $( \mathsf { N } = 4 1$ ), along with a few juniors $( \Nu = 6 ) $ ) and two seniors. Weekly, students dedicated $^ { 3 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ to lectures and an additional $^ { 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ to Teaching Assistant (TA) sessions. In the beginning of the semester, the students were asked to choose teammates and form groups of three to four people. While opportunities for collaboration during lectures were limited, students were instructed to work collectively on homework assignments and during TA sessions.

Aside from the 5-h weekly class, students also needed to complete frequently assigned problem sets as homework. Throughout the semester, there were thirteen assignments and each one included 20–30 problem sets taken from the textbook. Students were asked to work with teammates for each assignment, distribute the problem sets in equal amount among the group members, organize the answers in written form and submit the file as a team.

In terms of grading policy, the full score for the course was 110 points and of these, 95 points were dedicated to the exams. The remaining 15 points were distributed among attendance, homework assignments, and work submitted in the TA sessions. To pass this course, students needed to get at least 60 points. The grading breakdown presented on the course syllabus is shown below:

The first exam $23 \%$   
The second exam $23 \%$   
The third exam $2 4 \%$   
The fourth exam $2 5 \ \%$   
Homework assignments $5 \%$ ; Work submitted in the TA sessions $5 \%$ ; Attendance $5 \%$

In what follows, we provide descriptions of the assigned textbook as well as typical lecture and TA sessions as groundwork for showing their crucial inter-relations.

# 3.1.1. The textbook

The Taiwan Adapted Version of Mechanics of Materials (Hibbeler, 2017) was the assigned textbook. The book is basically identical with its Tenth SI Edition except that the Chapter Objectives and Chapter Review in the beginning and end of each chapter is in Chinese translation. Each chapter is divided into several major sections. A typical section consists of the following subsections (italics are the original sub-titles in the book).

(a) Explanation of a concept/theory/formula   
(b) Important Points: A short review of the main points covered in the section.   
(c) Procedures for Analysis: Explanation of the specific procedural steps on how to apply the theory or formula introduced earlier in the section when solving problems, with the reminders of pitfalls to avoid in numerical application. (Further explanation of this part will be provided later in the data analysis.)   
(d) Worked Examples: Problem sets (on average 1–3 sets per section) with explanations of the step-by-step solutions to illustrate the ideas introduced in subsections (a) ${ \sim } ( \mathbf { c } )$ .   
(e) Preliminary and Fundamental Problems: These problem sets consist solely of problem statements and are crafted to prompt students to apply the concepts or theories introduced in the respective section. The goal is to develop students’ “problem-solving skills before attempting to solve any of the standard problems that follow” (Hibbeler, 2017, p. 7). Answer keys are provided in the back of the book, but no detailed solutions are available.   
(f) Standard problems: Problem statements only. No answer keys or solutions are provided. The assigned homework problems were chosen from here.   
(g) Chapter Review: Provided at the end of each chapter, it contains a summary of the important points, diagrams, formulae and equations that the author wants to highlight.   
(h) Conceptual Problems: Problem sets with problem statements only.   
(i) Review Problems: Problem sets with problem statements only.

As outlined in the syllabus, students were required to read 12 out of the 14 chapters, with specified sections clearly indicated. Each exam covered 10 to 12 sections from the textbook, serving as an evaluation of students’ comprehension of the material. No special announcements or reminders were made in class regarding the need to preview the text before class.

# 3.1.2. The lectures

In the weekly lectures, the instructor used a combination of traditional blackboard techniques and PowerPoint slides to explain conceptual knowledge or demonstrate calculations. The slides were primarily written in English, and the majority of the content was images, excerpts, and problem sets taken from the textbook, with some brief annotations or highlights added by the instructor. Occasionally, she would show some supplementary materials, such as schematic diagrams of a construction project, or pictures of a construction site. Figure 1 shows a typical scene of lecture, where the instructor made use of the slides and writing on the blackboard to explain the textbook to students.

![](img/5c5d0564c5355f656aa30365df34632f52f585c950fe7aad6d3cded7c33fe05b.jpg)  
Figure 1. Students listening to the lecture.

During lectures, the instructor mainly used Chinese to explain the teaching materials, and translated key English technical terms orally for students whenever she felt it necessary. Her explanation regularly involved mathematical operations or demonstration of problem solving, in which case she would use the blackboard to show the calculations or drawings of diagrams. To emphasize technical terms, she would write them on the blackboard in both English and their corresponding Chinese equivalents. Occasionally, she would write them down using sign conventions represented by Greek symbols. However, for less important technical terms or those that she did not have time to cover, she would just orally explain the Chinese translation and quickly use a pointer to indicate the English equivalents on the slides. As a result, the students often needed to infer the corresponding meaning on their own.

# 3.1.3. The teaching assistant sessions

The 2-h Teaching Assistant sessions were arranged in the evening on a weekly basis. Unlike the lectures during the day, students sat in groups of four. The class consisted of approximately $1 2 \sim 1 3$ groups, with three TAs available to provide assistance. Every week there were two problem sets (written in English) distributed to each student. As a group, students were expected to engage in group discussions and document the solutions individually on their worksheet. While there were no explicit instructions on which language to use in their discussions and written responses, most students did both in their native language Chinese. When they were unsure of the English expressions in the problem statements or encountered difficulties in solving the problems, students would approach their TAs, who would provide explanations in Chinese for them. All students were required to complete solutions in written form before the sessions ended, and students could leave when they had completed their work.

# 3.2. Data collection

Data were collected through regular on-site observations after gaining informed consent from both the instructor and students. Observations were recorded in two ways, field notes and video filming by digital camera. Artifacts such as the assigned textbook, documents distributed by the instructor, problems sets in TA sessions, homework assignments and graded exam sheets (without student identities) were also collected. The other data source, the semi-structured interviews conducted individually, were arranged at the end of the course and conducted in the interviewees’ first language Chinese. Interviewees included the course instructor and 12 students, comprising seven males and five females, with samples from high performing groups and low performing groups. Students were approached as follows. The teacher suggested a list with 15 students based on their attendance rate and performance in previous exams. The list included three groupsdhigh, medium, and low achievers. The investigator then contacted these students, inviting them to participate in individual interviews. It was emphasized that participation was entirely voluntary, and should they choose to take part, gift cards would be offered as a gesture of appreciation. Among these students, 12 agreed and signed a consent form that granted permission to access their academic records, submitted homework, exam sheets, and class notes. An overview of all the data sources in this study is presented in Table 1.

Table 1 Overview of data sources.

As for the relationship between observer and observed, this study adopted the “observer as participant” stance (Gold, 1958), where an investigator’s observing activities were known to the group members, but her primary role was an information gatherer rather than a participant. This ethnographic-oriented approach can better document the spontaneous communication surrounding the text. Class observations could also inform the design of the subsequent interview questions. Since the purpose of the interviews “is to generate data which give an authentic insight into people’s experiences” (Silverman, 2001, p. 87) and the current EAP literature provides limited description of learners’ disciplinary classrooms, how to make interview questions closely related to learners’ experience can be challenging. Therefore, the artifacts collected from class observations or the communicative events observed in class all helped the investigator gain a better understanding of the experience and informed the interviews.

It is worth mentioning that in order to elicit how students exploit the meaning-making resources related to the textbook content, the interview included questions related not only to the textbook but also to the relevant materials that students encountered in class (i.e. lecture slides and the instructor’s explanation of the teaching materials, homework assignments, exam questions, problem sets distributed in the TA sessions). The interview questions (see Appendix A) were developed based on two major categories: (a) learning resources students encountered (i.e. input) and (b) learning products students produced (i.e. output). This approach allows us to examine both the input and output aspects, offering insights into students’ meaning-making process. Selected video footage of the class sessions was also shown to the interviewees to stimulate recall of how they used the textbook and how they approached understanding the conceptual knowledge in class.

In the individual interviews, students were first asked generally what kind of resources they would refer to when studying for the course, Mechanics of Materials. Then a list of relevant learning materials created by the investigator based on artifacts collected in on-site observations was given to them. The students were told to add any other items freely if not listed, check the items that they referred to when studying for the subject, and give an estimate of the percentage of effort they spent on each checked item the whole semester. Next, the checked items were used as prompts to elicit explanations for their reading behaviors, that is, why or why not they chose to refer to those resources. If students gave only a brief response or mentioned some other resources they use for studying, follow up questions that were not planned would be used to encourage them to elaborate. When the interview was conducted, other selected artifacts such as the instructor’s PowerPoint slides, problem sets distributed in the TA sessions, and exam sheets were also shown to the students to help them recall how they may have used the materials. The questions centered on what they encountered in class first, and moved to a more abstract aspect on their general reading strategies. After addressing questions related to the input of learning resources, students were then presented with a hard copy of the textbook. They were asked to demonstrate which part of the textbook they typically read and articulate the reasons behind their choices. Every interviewee was then directed to look at Chapter 7, using it as a specific example to provide further elaboration.

# 4. Data analysis

Building on the Translanguaging view of reading as an activity whereby readers assemble all their meaning-making resources across different languages and communicative forms, we gathered all the resources made available to the students within the interconnected network of textbook content, resources such as artifacts collected from on-site observations, video recordings of the lectures, and interviews. Interview data were transcribed verbatim and the transcripts were first coded inductively by the first author, where codes were derived from the data through iterative inspection. Then after categorizing, patterns were identified and themes were built (Coffey and Atkinson, 1996; Shank, 2002). Two broad categories emerged initially: students who read textbooks and students who did not. However, upon closer examination of the transcripts, it became apparent that some students who claimed not to read textbooks were actually engaging in selective reading. They were skipping the prose and focusing solely on the mathematical representations within the texts. This selective reading pattern prompted the first author to develop a new coding scheme. Each category within this scheme specified which parts of the textbook students paid attention to when reading. Categories included “checking the worked examples,” “checking the Chinese summary,” “checking the formulae,” and others. A single segment of text could receive more than one code if it contained multiple pieces of information.

Next, the first author collaborated with another coder to refine the coding scheme, engaging in discussions about potential additions or revisions to each set of codes. For instance, the code “checking the formulae” was merged with “checking the derivations of formulas,” resulting in a revised code name, “checking the equations and formulae.” The second coder’s expertise was particularly beneficial, given her role as an English lecturer with 14 years of experience teaching at the university level. Her extensive experience in instructing undergraduate students has enhanced her ability to interpret the students’ responses in the interviews, providing valuable insights into their intended meanings. After coding independently, the second coder discussed the results with the first author and worked together to resolve any disagreements. Due to the small dataset and the highly collaborative nature of the coding process, interrater reliability calculations were not conducted.

# 5. Results

In this section, we present our analysis by triangulating the various sources of data to answer the research questions. Using specific examples drawn from these sources, we illustrate the meaning-making resources being exploited by students and how they construe meaning from the textbook in the parallel language context. To answer Research Question 1:

What are the meaning-making resources and their interrelations available for Taiwanese students to learn and understand the content of the textbook in the disciplinary course?

We compare the artifacts collected from observations of lectures and TA sessions, together with the survey results from the student interviews. By examining the overlapping results, we compile an inventory of all the meaning-making resources related to textbook content as follows (see Table 2).

As mentioned earlier, the students being interviewed were asked what resources they relied on to understand the content of the textbook, then given a list of relevant learning materials to add to, check off, and estimate the percentage of effort they spent. While a majority of students mainly use the materials provided by the instructor and teaching assistants, some students reported that they would search for relevant videos online to help themselves better understand the textbook. After tabulating the estimated percentage all the students reported in the interviews, it is found that overall they allocate more effort to studying problem sets and notes taken in class. What is particularly noteworthy is that problem sets, including those found in the textbook (such as homework problem sets and worked examples), as well as previous exam questions provided by the instructor, seem to capture students’ attention, as they reported investing more time in studying these materials. During the interviews, students acknowledged that due to the collaborative nature of the assigned homework problem sets, they sometimes did not work through every problem set on their own before submission. Therefore, when reviewing the subject, they would revisit the homework problem sets in the textbook and work through them individually to ensure comprehension of the course material. The average of the percentage of effort that the interviewed students spent on each type of learning material is shown in Table 3, with the following four items being the most frequently utilized (presented in order of frequency): (A) homework problem sets, (E) exam questions in previous years, (D) study notes, and (B) worked examples in the textbook.

Note. Codenames for interviewees were assigned sequentially, starting with S01 and continuing in chronological order based on the timing of the interviews.

Although the students reported that on average only about $6 \%$ of effort was spent on studying the teacher’s PowerPoint slides (item F), class observations revealed that most of the slides contain the same information as the textbook. Furthermore, the instructor’s oral explanations closely follow the textbook, and when combined, they become influential meaning-making resources for students to understand the textbook content. We describe and illustrate this dense inter-relationship across these multiple sources below with an extended example using selected slides, interview results, and a sample of student’s notes all concerning the same item of conceptual content.

Figure 2 displays the PowerPoint slides that largely repeat the textual knowledge found on page 387 of the textbook, featuring identical diagrams and key points (Hibbeler, 2017). The instructor also mentioned in the interview that the publisher provided her e-book files as presentation resources from which she would select the more important parts to present to students. Using these slides, the instructor was able to navigate students through information from the textbook through her oral explanation, which entailed regular translation of the text and emphasis on key technical terms.

Figure 2. An example of the instructional slide shown in class.

One typical example can be found when the instructor was using her PowerPoint slides to explain the technical term “warp.” The textbook paragraph states:

When the shear force V is applied, it tends to deform these lines into the pattern shown in fig. 7–3b. This nonuniform shear-strain distribution will cause the cross section to warp; and as a result, when a beam is subjected to both bending and shear, the cross section will not remain plane as assumed in the development of the flexure formula. (Hibbeler, 2017, p. 387).

In the lecture, the instructor explained this part of the text in a parallel fashion, providing similar information in Chinese translation. We now break down the paragraph into individual segments for the sake of analysis, with the instructor’s oral explanation on the side (see Table 4). The underlined parts indicate the repeated ideas across the text and the oral narration.

As can be seen, the instructor was literally translating several key expressions from the text. In Segment (2) she mentioned biàn xíng (deform), and in Segment (3), qiào píng de xiàn xiàng (warping) was used to explain the technical term, warp, from the original English text. In Segment (4) she emphasized bú huì píng miàn bǎo chí píng miàn (will not remain plane) two times, first in the form of a rhetorical question: “Do the plane sections remain plane?” and then in the conclusion “the plane sections do not remain plane.” We see then from a student’s lecture notes that reveal the information she deemed important from her reading of this part of the text. The student wrote down: bú shì píng miàn bǎo chí píng miàn (will not remain plane), with an arrow leading to the technical term “warp” on the side, as shown in the circled part in Figure 3.

Figure 3. A student’s note.

One student in the interview also pointed out the similarity between information on PowerPoint slides and the textbook and explained how she utilized the slides to assist reading comprehension. Below is her response, which was originally in Chinese but has been translated into English for presentation purposes.

I have compared the textbook with the PowerPoint slides and found them to be quite similar. Perhaps the reason is that the textbook contains a lot of text, so the teacher just condensed the information into key points on the slides. Therefore, every time when I can’t find the key points in the textbook, I would look at the teacher’s PowerPoint slides to make sure I understand what the textbook is trying to convey. (S04).

So far we have demonstrated the interrelations between multiple meaning-making resources surrounding the textbook for EAP learners to understand the content of their textbook in their disciplinary context. Among them, problem sets from the textbook and previous exams, study notes, and the instructor’s oral explanations of the textbook are the most influential ones. Furthermore, in a parallel language context such as this one, L1 can be a useful learning resource that readers exploit in reading academic English.

Next, we present our findings for Research Question 2:

How do the student readers make use of the textbook and deploy its network of resources in this situated setting to construe meaning from the textbook?

Coded results from the semi-structured student interviews have shown that “checking the worked examples” and “checking the equations and formulae” were the most frequent responses among all the interviewees. Out of the 12 interviewed students, 11 of them mentioned they found the worked examples in the textbook most helpful to their learning and in each chapter mainly checked the parts that gave the worked examples.

In the textbook, the worked examples are arranged right after the explanation of a specific topic to illustrate how the concept or the formula can be applied. These example problem sets are presented in a one- or two-page spread layout, with detailed textual explanation on the procedures and the mathematical calculations of the solution. In each chapter, a section may contain one to three worked examples and on average these example problems occupy $2 5 \%$ of all the pages in a chapter.

# THIRD EXAM

1.A cantilevered beam is fabricated from two equivalent structural tees and two plates bolted together as shown in Figure. Each plate has a height of 6 in. and a thickness of 0.5 in.The beam supports a concentrated load of $P = 5 0$ kip at the free end of a $L = 8$ ft span.Each bolt can resist a shear force of 15 kips.

Figure 4. A problem set from the third major exam.

In the interviews, some students reported that they would read each line in the worked examples and see how each line or each step of calculation follows another.

I usually go to the worked examples in each chapter first before I started doing homework problem sets. And then I check my notes, and see how the worked examples solve the problem. (S01)   
- I find the worked examples in the book most useful, because I can see what the problem is usually asking and learn which equation or formula should be used. (S05)   
- Mostly I check the worked examples because they teach you how to solve problem sets step by step. (S10)

The reasons behind such choice are quite similar among the responses: reading the worked examples helps them learn the solution “step by step” and know “which equation or formula should be used” when solving problems. One student even acknowledged that after reading the problem statements, he would simply skip the textual explanation and go directly to the calculations in the worked examples to save time.

For the example problems, I would read the question first and then check the diagram provided to see what the problem set is asking. Then I go directly to the formulae or equations in the worked solutions, skipping the textual explanations on the procedures. (S02).

Another student explained her choice of reading only worked examples in an explicit way:

I just ignore all the prose in each chapter and go directly to the worked examples. I don’t think reading the prose is helpful at all. The important thing to me is to master problem solving. Even if you understand what the prose is saying, you still need to know how to solve problems. (S06)

Obviously, these students have prioritized reading the parts that they think helpful in developing problem-solving skills: the worked example problems. But in many parts of each chapter the textbook actually offers a separate section called “Procedures for Analysis” to advise student readers that when solving problems, what are the internal logical moves they should pay attention to when applying a specific theory or formula. It is an independent section that directly follows the introduction of an important concept or formula and precedes the worked example problems. The purpose is stated in the preface by the author:

Found after many of the sections of the book, this unique feature provides the student with a logical and orderly method to follow when applying the theory. The example problems are solved using this outlined method in order to clarify its numerical application. It is to be understood, however, that once the relevant principles have been mastered and enough confidence and judgment have been obtained, the student can then develop his or her own procedures for solving problems (Hibbeler, 2017, p. 8).

Although the intention of this design is to show the readers the logical moves between each step in the worked examples that follow, none of the interviewed students mentioned ever checking for this specific feature. After all, among all the tasks they complete in the TA sessions and the assignments they do out of class, practicing how to solve problem sets took up a large proportion of their time. Also, from a practical perspective to pass the course one would need to score high enough in the four major exams, which take 95 points of the course grade. It is not surprising, therefore, to see that with the help from the instructor translating important points in the textbook, the students opted to check the example problems as their main use of the textbook; it seems to be an economical way to allocate their time and attention when reading an 877-page textbook.

Figure 5. Answer from student A.

In fact, if we take a look at how the students answered the exam questions and the way they were graded, we can see that the students’ grasp of textual knowledge was evaluated by problem sets mostly. And in solving these problem sets in the exam, the students found it unnecessary to explain the logical steps in prose. This phenomenon seems to mirror how the function of the explanatory prose in the textbook was upstaged by problem sets. To illustrate this point, we will now analyze the answers of three students from their third major exam.

The third major exam was arranged in the 14th week of the semester, covering the content in Chapter 6, 7, and 12 of the textbook. Figure 4 shows one of the problem sets from the exam, which is related to textual knowledge in Chapter 7 about shear stress.

Figure 6. Answer from student B.

There were three sub-questions in this problem set, each worth 10 points. To make the explanation straightforward without delving into intricate content knowledge, let us focus on sub-question (b) now and examine how the students responded. The question is asking about maximum shear stress, which requires the application of the shear formula $\textstyle \tau \ = \ V Q /$ It. To answer this question correctly, the students need to locate and calculate the values for the four variables in the formula: $V , Q , I ,$ and t. The variable Q is more complicated because one also needs to use another equation $Q = { \vec { y } } A ^ { \prime }$ to calculate its value, which varies depending on the condition given. Student A received the full score for this question (see Figure 5). She specified the item the question is asking for: shear stress, the formula applied $\tau = V Q / I t$ , and the calculation of the variable Q in a very clear way.

![](img/a7589f8dee368c1cbb77cc91023302821722b2352d71e9c20a4dbcf627583617.jpg)  
Figure 7. Answer from student C.

Student B, however, answered in a more succinct way (see Figure 6). He only wrote down the process of calculation without specifying explicitly the formula he applied here.

This style of answering also qualified as a full score response, and he got 10 points just as Student A. Finally, when we compare Student B’s answer with Student C, the latter one did more work specifying the formula he used (see Figure 7), but he misjudged the condition and went into the wrong direction calculating the variable Q and t. With the wrong values for two out of the four variables, he got 3 points only.

From the three students’ answers above, we can see that these students did not find it necessary to demonstrate their grasp of textual knowledge through words when solving problems, as the quantitative representations appear to be sufficiently self-explanatory. Correspondingly, the teacher seemed to treat this style of answering as acceptable, judging from the fact that full score was given to answers with little explanation on the formula being used, so long as the process and result of calculations were correct. This pattern was found in the other 3 major exams too, each of which were filled with problem sets to be solved like the one shown in Figure 4.

Evidence from our data suggests that although the assigned text is multimodal in nature, assessing the understanding of the textbook among student readers was achieved by focusing on certain modes, i.e. mathematics and equations. The result aligns with our analysis of the survey data regarding frequently used learning materials and the feedback provided by students during the interviews, which indicate that they prioritize problem sets and extra-linguistic modes.

# 6. Discussion and implications

Data from this study has shown that students exploited various meaning-making resources when making sense of the ideas covered in the textbook. Aside from the book itself, the instructor’s explanation of the teaching materials, homework problem sets, and exam questions all proved to be important and interconnected resources that students rely on in their reading practices. Among the multiple resources, the students reported that problem sets and equations (in worked examples especially) were parts that drew their attention when reading the textbook. This particular way of reading resonates with what Ward (2001) found in his survey of Thai undergraduate students in chemical engineering, who focused mainly on examples and practices in the textbook. It may seem from these findings that the students are evading textbook reading. However, if we take into account the disciplinary nature of science and engineering, problem sets stand as a substantial component in scientific textbooks. In his analysis of academic textbooks, Parodi (2014) points out the drastic difference in rhetorical strategies between the two domains of knowledge: Basic Sciences and Engineering (BS&E) and Social Sciences and Humanities (SS&H). In the rhetorical move named “Practice,” which includes practical tasks such as problem sets, exercise, guided solutions or examples based on the contents covered in the section, the frequency in BS&E is significantly higher than that in SS&H. He further concludes that “in the BS&E texts, once a conceptual nucleus has been determined, exemplification and exercising are the fundamental means to integrate and stabilize new knowledge” (p. 74). Similarly, in the textbook of the course in the present study a large proportion of the textbook content is also allocated to problem sets, and the same is true of the design of homework assignments and exams in this course. In addition, the latest edition of this textbook also features that 430 new problems were added compared to the previous edition (Hibbeler, 2017, p. 8). Thus, when the multiple resources available in the course and the overall purpose of the course are taken into account, it would not be accurate to say that the students are avoiding reading the textbook.

The student readers’ preferences for selective parts of the textbook and selective modes of the text (i.e. the equations) revealed in this study, however, raises concerns, because this dichotomous view on prose and non-prose content contrasts with the reading practices of the expert readers. Previous research has shown that subject specialists in the field of science and mathematics treat prose and extra-linguistic modes as equally significant modes that contribute to text comprehension (Shanahan et al., 2011). Consequently, it is crucial for students to understand that the explanatory prose in the textbook should not take a less important role compared to problem sets. This is because when solving problem sets, the assumptions that one is based on and the logical thought process of how each step connects are the primary foundations of numerical application. We can see how essential these primary foundations are from the “Procedures for Analysis” sections that the author of the textbook arranged before showing the solutions for example problems. In fact, students’ over-reliance on using chains of numerical calculations only to tackle a problem set (the so-called plug-and-chug strategy) have worried professors in science and engineering (Durfee et al., 2011; Hohmann and Pielsticker, 2022; Kortemeyer, 2016). As an engineer, teacher and researcher, Trevelyan (2014) conducted extensive research into engineer practices and delineated the differences between novice and expert engineers. He points out that students and novice engineers often consider explanation of assumptions in problem solving unnecessary because they perceive the inherent logic of mathematical calculations as selfexplanatory. But a critical distinction between expert engineers and their less experienced counterparts is that the experts regard logical explanations in prose as an essential component. That is, although proficiency in mathematical language is undeniably vital for engineers, neglecting the development of verbal reasoning skills can lead to serious errors due to “inappropriate assumptions, critical thinking mistakes, or even conceptual misunderstanding” (p. 61). In light of this, the students in the present study may aim to improve themselves in problem-solving skills, yet their approach of focusing on reading the worked examples exclusively and skipping the explanatory prose that details the assumptions and logical thought behind the problem-solving process could have unintended consequences. This approach may hinder rather than improve their ability to solve problems effectively.

Regrettably, the literature on content area reading indicates that subject-specific teachers often minimize literacy instruction, a practice also observed in this study. This practice leaves students to grapple with the complexities of textbooks independently. While the subject teacher in our study acknowledged in the interview that she thinks it is essential for students to learn to read textbooks, in many undergraduate courses such as this one, she has no choice but to condense the textbook content and summarize it in Chinese for students. Her main reasons are: (1) She suspects many students do not even read textbooks after class, so she needs to explain the content orally and (2) This is the most efficient way to cover all the targeted materials within the limited timeframe of one semester. This is in line with the findings in previous studies (ACT, 2006; Draper, 2002), showing literacy instruction being marginalized in disciplinary classrooms. One of the underlying factors in content-area teachers’ struggle to embrace literacy instruction, as noted by Siebert and Draper (2008), is that they often have difficulty perceiving the connections between teaching predominantly prose-based texts and students’ grasp of the multimodal texts containing graphs, diagrams, and mathematical symbols that are prevalent in their disciplines.

To address this persistent challenge, we propose a multimodal approach to EAP lesson design, which involves integrating literacy instructional activities that respond to the extra-linguistic elements frequently found in the textbooks in science and engineering, such as diagrams and mathematical equations. The pivotal role of content knowledge and authentic materials in EAP instruction has been acknowledged by EAP practitioners (Kaivanpanah et al., 2021). This approach adds layers of authenticity and would be most effective with strong collaborative effort between subject experts and EAP professionals. Such collaboration would facilitate disciplinary teachers in enhancing their literacy instruction while equipping language teachers with a deeper understanding of the subject matter. The prose the EAP instructors may tend to focus on and the extralinguistic features of graphs and equations that students attend to more are mutually illuminating. It is important to begin from the motivating premise and guide students to uncover and exploit these inter-relations across different modes. Accordingly, learning tasks can be designed to require students to explain, in written or spoken English, the information they attain from diagrams or equations, and to articulate the connections between those extra-linguistic modes and prose in selected textbook excerpts. This process of “translation” across modes follows closely with the reading practices of disciplinary experts, as illustrated in Shanahan et al.’s (2012) study.

Another way to engage students in cross-modal interpretations is to ask them not only to record quantitative representations but also to incorporate verbal explanations to elucidate their logical progression. Doran’s (2015) discourse analysis of physics problems offers a valuable framework that can serve as a scaffolding tool for students. In his examination of the inherent grammar of mathematical language in physics, Doran outlines the four stages that textbooks use when illustrating solutions to problem sets: Situation, Reorganization, Result, and Interpretation. In the first stage, Situation, the initial phase of the calculation is established by identifying the mathematical formula to be used and describing the parameters involved in the calculation. Then the second stage, Reorganization, shows the manipulation and rearrangement of the selected equations and numerical values. After the calculations, the third stage Result is presented, either in numerical or symbolic form. Finally, the mathematical outcome is rephrased into words in the last stage, Interpretation, which highlights the critical information that the textbook authors want students to remember. In the context of EAP lesson design, the first three stages can become particularly relevant. For example, after writing down their solutions in quantitative representations, students can be prompted to use English to identify the different stages within and elaborate their logical progression in each stage in written or spoken language.

A multimodal approach to literacy instruction helps bridge the gap between traditional text-based materials and the extra-linguistic content in science and engineering classrooms. Embracing multimodality allows us to bring new dimensions to the development of EAP materials, lesson planning, assessment techniques, and the design of teacher professional development programs. EAP curriculum and pedagogy could then in turn better address the specificity of academic disciplines.

# 7. Limitation and suggestions for future studies

This study draws on a diverse range of data sources, including on-site observations, interviews with both students and the teacher, examination of course artifacts, and analysis of subject-specific textbooks and lectures. While we have strived to provide a comprehensive and coherent depiction of how contextual factors impact students’ EAP reading practices, it is important to note that our study is confined to a single disciplinary classroom with one instructor. There is ample room for similar investigations into the reading practices of EAP learners across various disciplinary settings.

Moreover, we would like to draw attention to the fact that although the significance of genre analysis and addressing learners’ needs in EAP materials development have been widely acknowledged (Basturkmen, 2021; Hyland and Jiang, 2021; Stoller, 2016), problem sets and worked examples as significant rhetorical components in disciplinary textbooks have received limited attention in EAP literature to date. Further research is needed to illuminate how within this component the use of extra-linguistic modes, such as mathematical representations, interacts with the textual explanation, as well as how this rhetorical component interacts with other components throughout the textbook.

In conclusion, in order to fully understand how to enhance students’ use of their textbooks to meet the sense-making demands of such courses, much more work is needed in further investigating the characteristics of parallel language contexts in EAP settings. So far there is little research examining how second language learner students read their disciplinary textbooks in such an environment and the potential impact of teachers’ gender and teaching experiences on these students. This group of EAP students are multilingual learners who are required to read multimodal text in a highly specialized disciplinary discourse. Their diversity demands a more extensive and holistic approach to understand their reading practices and address their needs. It is hoped that the current study provides some example of how such further work may be carried out in a way that acknowledges the network of mutually illuminating relations in which textbooks are situated and how such a network shapes learners’ sense-making of both linguistics and extra-linguistic modes.
