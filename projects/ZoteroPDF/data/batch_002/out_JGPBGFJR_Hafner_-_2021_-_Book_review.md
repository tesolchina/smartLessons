The importance of the public communication of science has been thrown into relief by recent events surrounding the global Covid-19 pandemic. As well as a public health crisis, the world has also been confronted with a crisis of communication and the Internet has played a major role in this second crisis. This issue of the communication of science to non-specialist audiences is one of the topics that María-Jose Luz on and Carmen P erez-Llantada deal with in their edited volume Science Communication on the Internet published by John Benjamins in 2019. The book amply addresses the notion that the Internet enables scientists to reach out to wider, more diverse audiences, including for the purposes of promoting public understanding of science. But the volume also goes much further than this, tackling a range of topics of interest to researchers and practitioners of English for academic purposes (EAP), including the implications of the use of digital media for communication between specialists as well.

The editors have succeeded in assembling an exciting line-up of leading scholars in science communication, genre analysis, and language for specific purposes (LSP) to take up the question of how specialized communication practices change as they go online. They do this utilizing a variety of methodological approaches, from corpus-assisted discourse analysis to ethnographic case study. Unlike some edited volumes, the chapters form a neatly coherent and unified whole, and the editors should be commended on the way that they have brought together such diverse yet complementary contributions.

In the opening chapter, Luzon and P  erez-Llantada provide a comprehensive overview of research into digital genres in the  domain of science, highlighting themes of genre remediation, genre development, and genres for diversified audiences. The remaining chapters are organised in a rough progression from more specialized to more popular genres. Chapters 2 and 3 by Joseph E. Harmon, and Ashley Rose Mehlenbacher and Brad Mehlenbacher respectively, focus on the digital scientific research article. Chapter 4 by Graciela Rabuske Hendges and Cristiane Salete Florek provides a multimodal genre analysis of the graphical abstract. This multimodal focus is maintained in Chapter 5 by Elizabeth Rowley-Jolivet and Shirley Carter-Thomas, examining three-minute thesis presentations, author videos and scientific podcasts. In Chapter 6, Ruth Breeze analyses the specialized genre of public author responses to online peer reviews. Chapters 7 and 8, by Carmen Daniela Maier and Jan Engberg, and Ivana Mirovic, Vesna Bogdanovic, and Vesna Bulatovic, move to more overtly hybrid digital articles, aimed at scholars and practitioners. Public facing genres are covered in Chapter 9 by Deborah Orpin (Twitter), Chapter 10 by Graham Smart and Matthew Falconer (papal encyclicals), and Chapter 11 by Gwendolynne Reid and Chris M. Anson (citizen science).

In reading the contributions to this volume, one is struck by the fascinating balance between generic innovations, on the one hand, and generic stability on the other. Harmon’s consideration of the digital scientific article, for example, focuses on innovations like enhanced visualizations, semantic markup, and open reviews. Breeze provides a detailed linguistic analysis of the latter practice, in which peer reviews and responses to them are made public in a range of ways. She emphasises the interplay between generic stability and change, comparing a corpus of ‘traditional’ author response texts with a corpus of open responses and noting both similarities and differences. As she points out, ‘the author response genre is evolving in response to the digital transition: authors are now aware that they are explaining themselves to a wider potential audience, and are willing to invest more time in defending their own position’ (p. 119). It is also noteworthy that, as pointed out by a number of contributors, genre change does not arise from technological developments alone, though this is certainly an important factor. For example, in their treatment of the innovative genre of registered reports, Mehlenbacher & Mehlenbacher suggest that social developments and generic exigence play an important role.

An important theme to emerge from the volume is the diversification of audiences (and attendant generic hybridity) made possible by digital media. Indeed, most of the contributions acknowledge, in one way or another, the ability of scientists to reach a wider audience and the associated tendency of digital media to potentially restructure social relationships and participation frameworks (Goffman, 1981). We see a striking example of this in the final contribution to the volume by Reid and Anson, which provides an ethnographic case study of members of a team of scientists in the process of composing a research article based on findings from citizen science, a practice that draws on crowd-sourcing methods to involve members of the public in conducting scientific research. The authors describe how this team ‘used the thinking generated by their writing for a public context in order to advance thinking and writing for a scientific context’ (p. 228, emphasis in original). That is, the team’s efforts to popularise their scientific activity, whether through books, blog posts, social media, or public presentations could lead them to generate important scientific insights to be investigated. This process of communicating with a wide public audience is one that is greatly enhanced by digital media and the kinds of internet platforms it provides scientists with.

By highlighting the diversification of audience in digital media contexts, the contributions draw attention to potential theoretical issues in genre analysis, a concern shared by other scholars of EAP engaging with the online context (Kuteeva & Mauranen, 2018; Hafner & Pun, 2020). As Luzon and P erez-Llantada put it, there is a need to ‘reconsider whether audience can still be deemed as a defining criterion of genre analysis’ (p. 12). This is clearly linked to the important notion of discourse community in genre theory (Swales, 1990). In Chapter 5, Rowley-Jolivet and Carter-Thomas show how such considerations of audience and community work themselves out at a rhetorical and linguistic level. In particular, their analysis of three-minute theses by novice researchers identifies heavy use of dramatisation through ‘scenarios’, contributing to more of a ‘show’ than a research presentation (p. 96). They express concern that the ‘mediatization’ of science for this wider, non-specialist audience, accompanied as it is by selection of content and simplification, could have a negative impact on specialized genres.

Many scholars have commented on the forms of representation associated with hypertextual and multimodal affordances of digital media that accompany the shift from the logic of the page to the logic of the screen (Kress, 2003). The scientific genres that are considered in this volume also frequently make use of such new forms of representation. The contributions demonstrate how such scientific genres can be seen as forming part of sophisticated ecologies, with both digital scientific articles and popularisations supplemented by hyperlinked and embedded genres that ‘expand’ and ‘enhance’ the construction of knowledge (as the contributions by Maier and Engberg, as well as Mirovic, Bogdanovic, and Bulatovic would have it). As noted above, the importance of multimodal forms of communication facilitated by digital media is also highlighted in a number of contributions, for example that of Rabuske Hendges and Salete Florek.

There is an understandable tendency in EAP research to eschew historical or diachronic treatments of genre development. At the same time, the rapid change that can be observed in digital contexts offers a unique opportunity to observe the evolution of genres, in rhetorical and formal terms (Hafner, 2018). It is therefore pleasing to see two of the contributions to this volume actively engage with this historical perspective. Orpin’s chapter on the popularisation of science on Twitter demonstrates increasing structural complexity and greater use of images over a five-year period from 2013 to 2018. Smart and Falconer trace the representation of science in papal genres all the way from a 1964 address to the Pontifical Academy of Science by Pope Paul VI to the 2015 papal encyclical Laudato Si’ by Pope Francis. The latter is seen as a genre in transition from print to digital, made available online to a wide audience and accompanied by tweets from Pope Francis’ Twitter account at its launch, as well as online public responses in the form of e-newsletters, e-bulletins, blog posts, news articles, press releases, and tweets.

One question that could be addressed more directly throughout the volume is the question of what all of these observations mean to stakeholders - the scientific writers who draw on digital tools in their communication practices. How do they perceive the evolution of communication practices described in the volume and to what extent do they embrace them (Perez- Llantada, 2013)? One potentially interesting way of gaining access to such views is to invite collaborating specialists to write contributions to the volume themselves (Bhatia and Bremner, 2014). In the present volume, the voices of the scientific specialists do come through, for example in the surveys conducted by Rabuske Hendges and Salete Florek, and in the ethnographic case study of Reid and Anson. Secondly, only a few of the contributions appear to contemplate the implications of findings in terms of language and literacy skills, and in particular, what it all means for language and literacy education in the scientific domain. While this might be a bit beyond the scope envisaged for the present volume, there is still an ongoing need for future work in EAP to determine how pedagogy can account for the kinds of ‘emerging needs’ reported here (Hafner & Miller, 2019). The present volume succeeds in delineating in some detail what some of these needs look like.

All in all, Luzon and P erez-Llantada have produced an impressive work of scholarship. The book is rich in insights on digitally mediated communication for science and provides an exhaustive overview of the state of the art in this quickly developing field. It is to be hoped that researchers and practitioners in EAP can apply the findings presented here both in order to better understand genres in the digital age as well as to refine their teaching practices accordingly.
