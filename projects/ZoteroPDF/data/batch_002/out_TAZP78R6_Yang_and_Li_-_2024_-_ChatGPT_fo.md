Second language (L2) learning

Despite a recent proliferation of studies on ChatGPT for second language (L2) learning, there is still a lack of systematic and updated review of its current status. To narrow the gap, this study collected data from 44 selected studies on ChatGPT for L2 learning in terms of six dimensions of the revised technology-based learning model, including ChatGPT, participants, objectives, theories, methodology, and outcomes. The results showed that (1) The most prevalent ChatGPT's roles included content generation, feedback and teaching support. Context control and output customization were the two main prompt patterns. (2) Most studies focused on investigating English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) college learners with small sample sizes. (3) Learner perceptions (general attitudes, satisfaction, motivation, and engagement) along with writing skills were the major objectives. (4) Social (sociocultural and constructivism), linguistic (input hypothesis, informal digital learning), and cognitive (self-determination theory, autonomy) theories were frequently adopted. (5) Most studies used qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods, with a particular eye on questionnaire surveys, interviews, log data and written texts. (6) Benefits and challenges were summarized from the selected studies. Implications were discussed for future research.

# 1. Introduction

In the era of digital technology, emerging computer-assted language learning (CALL) devices or technologies have offered a vast array of opportunitie for second/foreign language (L2/FL) acquisitio, among which traditional chatbots have received considerable attention, as they could serve as conversational agents/tutors to engage L2 learners in language communication (Li, 2024; Wu & Li, 2024a, 2024b). However, those traditional chatbots, or rule-based chatbots, have a limited capacity to understand L2 learners inputs and could merely provide pre-defined guidance on certain L2 topics step-by-step, regardless of learners' personalized demands (Kohnke et al., 2023). The advent of OpenAI's ChatGPT in the year 2022 together with the increased use of ChatGPT has dramatical changed traditional L2 learning and teaching scenarios, because ChatGPT could outperform traditional chatbots with clear and specific prompts to harnessits ful L2 education potentials in a dialogue form (Kohnke et al., 2023), provide 2 learners with enhanced input and human-computer interaction from the interactionist theory perspective (Chapelle, 2005), and \*process long input, generate innovative responses to varying prompts, and maintain a continuous chat flow" (Su et al., 2023, p.2). The affordances of ChatGPT for L2 learning have been well documented, including fostering positive learner perceptions (Agustini, 2023; Marzuki et al., 2023), facilitating writing and general language sills (Athanassopoulos et a., 2023; Vera, 2023), and supplementing teacher support in L2 learning (e.g., Barret et al., 2023; Jeon & Lee, 2023; Mohamed, 2024), among others.

While a growing body of empirical studies has been steadily conducted, athorough, systematic review of ChatGPT for L2 learning remains rare (Barrot, 2023), and the accumulation of suficient empirical evidence also necesstates a panoramic vision of its state-of-the-art research trends. In other words, a comprehensive synthesis, based on the dimensions of revised technology-based learning model (Li, 2022a), could not only contribute to the holistic understanding of ChatGPT for L2 learning that informs pedagogy, but also provide some seful implications for future reearch. As such, this rearch sees o synthesie tdies of ChatG for L2 learning, with a particular eye on such dimensions as ChatGPT (ChatGPT's roles and prompt patterns), participants (educational lels, sample sizes and target languages), objective (language skills and lening percetions), (lingustic, social, cognitive, and others) theories, (general and specific) methods, and outcomes (advantages and challenges).

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Related studies

While ChatGPT's facilitative effects have been widely obtained, more detailed content with regard to its effectiveness for L2 learning is yet to be discovered.

On the one hand, proponents have claimed the advantages of integrating ChatGPT into L2 learning (e.g., Guo & Wang, 2023; Jeon & Lee, 2023; Vera, 2023. Specificall, Jeon and Lee (2023) contended that ChatGPT could promote English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) learners learning efficacy, because it could not only provide leaning resources and feedback, but also serve as chat partner and evaluator. Li and colleagues (2023) adopted a mixed-method design to explore the use of ChatGPT on L2 learners' writig sil development, and posited that ChatGPT could afford leaners with personalized feedback, content generation, and teaching support. Based on the sociocultural theory, Vera (2023) investigated ChatGPT's pedagogical benefits for EFL learners' language proficiency, and the results demonstrated that learners of the experiment group receiving ChatGPT-based instruction outperformed those of the control group receiving traditional classroom instruction, sugesting that ChatGPT could improve EFL learners language proficiency more effectively with personalized, interactive, and engaging affordances.

On the other hand, critics have raised concerns about the potential challenges of ChatGPT for L2 learning (e.g., Lee et al., 2023; Mohamed, 2024; Yan, 2023). As highlighted in arecent qualitative study (Yan, 2023), EFL leaners expressed concerns with ChatGPT's danger to educational quality and academic honesty in L2 writing practicum, because learners' L2 writing processcould be simplified from \*reading-writing-revision' to text-generation and post-editing" when using ChatGPT as ashortcut for writing practice. Adhering to contextual language learning, Lee et al. (2023) integrated ChatGPT into augmented reality (AR) glases to establish a contextual learning stting and explored its impacts on EFL learners affctive perceptions. By adopting a quantitative aproach, they obtained that ChatGPT had limited effects on enhancing learning satisfaction and engagement in immersive learning activities and suggested more investigations into EFL learners perceptions of ChatGPT be conducted in future research. Drawing on input hypothesis, Escalante et al. (2023) compared the effect of ChatGPT- and teacher-generated feedback on L2 learners' writing skill development and claimed that no significant difference existed between two types of feedback, i.e., ChatGPT-vs. teacher-generated feedback.

# 2.2. Related reviews

Despite those empirical studies, reearchers have also conducted several review studies (e.g., Hwang & Chang, 2023; Kuhail t al. 2023; Smutny & Schreiberova, 2020) on traditional chatbots pertinent to this study. For instance, Huang et a. (2022) systematicaly synthesized 25 selected studies on chatbots social, technological, and pedagogical affordances along with challenge for L2 learning. Results indicated that chatbot-supported language learning can offer such advantages as interaction, fedback, teaching support, and recommendation, while challenges of failure to launch long conversations, novelty effect, and increased cognitie load should be cautioned as well Similarly, J et al. (2023) reviewed 24articles on chatbot roles in L2 education, and found chatbots were commonly adopted for content generation, feedback, assessment and grading, and teaching support. Due to the rapid advancement of speech-recognition technology, Jeon, Lee, and Choi (2023) paid renewed attention to the 32 studie on speech-based chatbots for L2 education regarding publication trends, participants, methodology, research foci, chatbot roles, adopted devices, and learning con texts. They recommended that future researchers should investigate roles of chatbots beyond that of conversation partner and explore the effects of those functions on L2 outcomes. In a recent study, Jon, Lee, and Choe (2023) presented an overview of the features and benefits of chatbots for L2 education by proposing a thre-dimension framework, viz. multimodality, embodiment, and goal-orientation. Their findings suggested that future research should explore ChatGPT's characteristics and affordances through the lens of solid theoretical framework.

# 2.3. Research statement and questions

While the aforementioned quantitative investigations and qualitative reviews are insightful to ChatGPT for L2 learning research, several important gaps remain underexplored. First, despite the importanceattached to ChatGPT and the large amount of research that has been cared out, the i no systmatic synthesis f ChatGPT for L2 learning research, and the growing interest in ChatGPT calls for a review on the existing studies for the purpose of acting as a one-step pathfinder where the reader has a comprehensive acess to knowledge about ChatGPT for L2 learning. Second, considering that sufficient quantitative investigations of ChatGPT for L2 learning have been done, the mixed findings suggest the necessity to revisit the benefits and challenges of utilizing ChatGPT for L2 learning. Third and importantly, existing reviews only explored the limited dimensions of chatbots that lacked a comprehensive theoretical underpinning of investigation, e.g., participants, methodology, and research foci. Other important dimensions-technologies, ob jectives, theories, and outcomes also warrant detailed scrutin in ChatGPT for L2 learning (Jeon, Le, & Choi, 2023; Yang et al., 2024; Zou et al, 2022). In this regard, the current research was carried out by taking revised technology-based learning model as the theoretical underpinning, because it has been widely applied in explaining the multi-dimensionality of CALL technologies for L2 learning, such as language massive open online courses (LM00cs, Fang et al., 2022), blended language learning (Li, 2022a), and mobile-assted language learning (MALL, Liu & Hwang, 2023), which would serve as an appropriate framework in this study with a comprehensive coverage of technologies-related (viz. ChatGPT), participants-related, and research-related (e.g, objectives, theories, methods, and outcomes) dimensions.

As apparent in Fig. 1, there were six dimensions as ChatGPT (ChatGPT's roles and prompt patterns), participants (educational levels, sample sizes and target languages), objective (language sils and lerning perceptions), (linguistic, social, cognitive, and others) theorie, (general and specific) methods, and outcomes (advantages and challenges). Specificall, ChatGPT's roles refer to the use of ChatGT for content generation, feedack, teching support, aessment and recommendation, whers prompt patterns refer to the prompt pattrn catalogs that precisely outline the desired content of the materials ChatGPT users intend to generate, such as context control, output customization, zero-shot prompting, eror identification, etc. (White et al., 2023). Objectives include L2 learner's learning perceptions and language skills. Theories are the rlated social, linguistic, cognitive, and other theories. Based on Jeon, Lee, and Choi (2023), participants cover educational levels, sample sizes and target languages. Methods involve general and/or specific methods employed in the reviewed studies. Last, outcomes include ChatGPT's benefits and disadvantages.

As a consequence, this study attempts to systematicall synthesize studies of ChatGPT for L2 learning in terms of ChatGPT, par. ticipants, objectives, theories, methods, and outcomes. The scope of this review is based on the research questions that follow.

1. What are ChatGPT's roles and its prompt patterns reported in the studies of ChatGPT for L2 learning?   
2. What are educational levels, sample sizes and target languages reported in the studies of ChatGPT for L2 learning?   
3. What are language skills and learner perceptions reported in the studies of ChatGPT for L2 learning?   
4. What are related theories adopted in the studies of ChatGPT for L2 learning?   
5. What are research methods reported in the studies of ChatGPT for L2 learning?   
6. What are advantages and challenges in the studies of ChatGPT for L2 learning?

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Literature retrieval

The following literature retrieval procedures were diagramed in Fig. 2 to exhaustively retrieve literature on ChatGPT for L2 learning. First, based on existing qualitatie reviews (e.g., Ansari et al., 2023; Jeon et al., 2023; Lo, 2023), online databases (Fig 2) were searched by using those Boolean expressions and truncation (\*)of key terms pertinent to L2 learning (second language OR foreign language OR L2 OR EFL OR ESL OR language learning OR language teaching OR language acquisition OR speak\* OR communicat\* OR listen\* OR read\* OR vocabulary OR writ\* OR grammar) AND ChatGPT (ChatGPT OR AI Chatbots OR artificial intelligence agents. Second, though cheking reeencs in the identified articles (., Anri et a., 2023; Cai et a., 2023; Lo, 2023; allam et al., 2023), a backward and forward search of the selected studies was launched by adopting snowballing technique (Biernacki & Waldorf, 1981). Third, manual rerieval of language education and educational technology journals (Fig. 2) was done to avoid the incompleteretrieval (Zou et al., 2021, 2022; Li, 2023b, 2023c).

# 3.2. Data trimming criteria

As shown in Fig. 2, the selected studies were further trimmed in relation to the following proposed criteria.

1. Articles written in English should be confined to 2022-2023, because ChatGPT was initially developed in 2022 (Lo, 2023). Studies that are written in any other languages or time range were excluded.   
2. Articles selected should be peer-reviewed journal articles or conference proceedings for two considerations: On the one hand. academic rigor of peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings could be warranted, because they reported original findings of ChatGPT for L2 learning based on stict research design (e.g., participants, methods, objectives, and outcomes). On the other hand, the inclusion of both peer-reviewed journal articles and conference proceedings could reduce the risk of publication bias and capture the most up-to-date information of ChatGPT for L2 learning (Huang et l. 2021). Studies in other forms (e.g., preprints, dissertations, or non-academic articles) were not considered.   
3. Empirical data should be reported in the selected studies. Studies that only propose the development or technology review of ChatGPT without the involvement of L2 learners were excluded.   
4. Only studies of ChatGPT for L2 learning should be considered. Those that deal with the use of self-developed chatbots, automated writing evaluation, or other AI tools without any involvement of ChatGPT for second or foreign language learning were not considered.

# 3.3. Coding scheme

The detailed illustration of coding scheme was presented in Appendix 1, including dimensions, coding types, subtypes, definition of subtypes, and sources.

# 3.4. Coding procedures

Three coding procedures were performed: First, two coders iscussed mutually to improve the consistent understanding of each item. Second, they separately coded al the 44selected studies related to ChatGPT's roles, ChatGPT's prompt patterns, participants, language skill, learning perceptions, theoretical frameworks, methods, and outcomes with spss 24.0. The overall intercoder agreement of $K = 0 . 9 5 0$ $( p < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ had been obtained at this stage. Third, the discrepancies were addressed through negotiation and analysis of the coding scheme.

others, e.g., activity theory $( k = 1 )$ , contextual learning $( k = 1 )$ , experiential learning $( k = 1 )$ , social cognitive theory $( k = 1 )$ , peer comments $( k = 1 )$ , and peer scaffolding $( k = 1 )$ , were less frequently considered.

Besides those social theories, linguistic theories were the second most frequently used $( k = 6 )$ , including informal digital learning of English $( k = 1 )$ , input hypothesis $( k = 1 )$ , error analysis $( k = 1 )$ , theory of universal grammar $( k = 1 )$ , process writing $( k = 1 )$ , and creative writing $( k = 1 )$

Researchers also used cognitive theories $( k = 5$ and other theories $\left( k = 4 \right)$ . Among those cognitive theories, motivation/selfdetermination theory $( k = 3 )$ received considerable attention, followed by autonomy $( k = 1 )$ ) and theory of planned behavior $( k =$ 1). Other frameworks included technology acceptance model $( k = 3 )$ and reflective learning $( k = 1 )$

# 4.5. Methods

As displayed in Table 3,all the three general methods were frequently adopted in the selected studies, including quantitative $( k =$ 16), qualitative $( k = 1 5 )$ , and mixed methods $( k = 1 3$ , respectively.

The popular quantitative methods contained questionnaire $( k = 1 2 )$ and tests $( k = 1 )$ . For qualitative methods, qualitative methods including interviews $( k = 1 0$ , class observation $( k = 2 )$ , log data $( k = 1 )$ , audio/video recordings $( k = 1 )$ , and reflection $( k = 1 )$ were used to evaluate learner perceptions and performance. Regarding mixed methods, combinations of both quantitative and qualitative methods, such as close-ended questionnaires $^ +$ interviews $( k = 5 )$ , close- and open-ended questionnaires $^ +$ tests $( k = 1 )$ , tests $^ +$ reflections $( k = 1 )$ , questionnaires $^ +$ interviews $+ 1 0 { \bf g }$ data $( k = 1 )$ , questionnaires $^ +$ tests $+ 1 0 { \bf g }$ data $( k = 1 )$ , and close- and open-ended questionnaires $( k = 1 )$ , were frequently used.

# 4.6. Outcomes

Table 4 summarized the advantages and challenges of adopting ChatGPT for L2 learning.

The most frequently reported benefits included improving perceptions and attitudes towards L2 learning $( k = 1 9 )$ , improving four language skills $( k = 8 )$ , facilitating autonomous learning and increasing L2 practice $( k = 3 )$ , providing an interactive, enjoyable, and engaging learning environment $( k = 2 )$ , reducing teachers' workload and facilitating flexible teacher roles $( k = 2 )$ , among others.

Those challenges should be cautioned, such as plagiarism or privacy issues $( k = 1 2 )$ , inaccurate or inappropriate responses $( k = 1 0 )$ learners' over-reliance on ChatGPT $( k = 8 )$ , technical issues and learners' unfamiliarity with ChatGPT $( k = 7 )$ , failure to improve language skills $( k = 6 )$ , cultural insensitivity, language biases, and limited personalization $( k = 4 )$ , lack of emotional or empathetic responses $( k = 3 )$ , failure to generate texts with syntactic simplicity and deep cohesion. $( k = 3 )$ , failure to integrate ChatGPT into curriculum $( k = 2 )$ , and failure to facilitate advanced L2 skills or offer higher-order feedback $( k = 2 )$ , etc.

# 5. Discussion

The first research question dealt with ChatGPT's roles and prompt patterns. Regarding ChatGPT's roles, results demonstrated that the primary function of ChatGPT for L2 learning was content generation,feedback, and teaching support. This finding was in apparent contradiction with Ji et al. (2023) who postulated that traditional chatbots were most commonly adopted for conversational practice in language learning. A plausible explanation might rest on the ChatGPT's artficial intelligence generated content (AIGC) feature as compared to traditional chatbotsutilizing Al tools to generate the required content automatically, including standard writing samples (Li et al., 2023a), exercises for L2 use (Lashari et al., 2023), and L2 quzes (Han et al., 2023). For instance, Yan (2023) explored the influence of ChatGPT's automatic text generation on learner perceptions of EFL writing, and suggested that ChatGPT could improve their writing performance in grammatical accuracy and lexical diversity by generating wel-structured writing samples for reference. Besides content generation, ChatGPT could provide L2 learners with personalized feedback, including err detection (Ahmed, 2023), eror corction (Escalante e al., 2023), and proofreading suggestions (Faiz et al., 2023), among others. As Guo and Wang (2023) claimed, different from the traditional chatbots that provide one-size-fits-for-all feedback, ChatGPT could not only reiterate fdback in easier terms for learners o understand, but lso further explain the rationale for the feedback. Besides, ChatGPT has been documented to offer L2 learners with necessary teaching support, including conversation agent (Bin-Hady e l., 2023; Jeon & Lee, 2023) and intelligent question-answering (Samarasinghe & Prasangani, 2023). This was because ChatGPT provided learners with unlimited opportunities for L2 practice without temporal and spatial constraints, which could reduce teachers' workload and shift their fcus on other important tasks, such as presenting new content, scaffolding activitie, and leading discussions Jeon & Le, 2023; Ji et al., 2023).

The context control was one of the most frequently adopted prompt patterns, which could be partly due to ChatGPT's failure of understanding EFL leaners intended prompts for specific contexts and the output of irelevant responses (Kohoke et al., 2023). In other words, ChatGPT could better proces instructions and elicit more accurate output with the provision of explicit and specific contextual information. For instance, Escalante et al. (2023) required ChatGPT to focus on the main idea, transitional phrases, and grammatical accuracy in L2 writing, and found that the clarity and specificity of ChatGPT-generated feedback could be improved. Similarl, Barrt et al. (2023) required ChatGPT to generate essays on certain topics such as global warming and climate change, and asserted that through the context control, ChatGPT could serve as a useful tool to brainstorm ideas for the L2 writing process. The second commonly implemented prompt pattern was output customization-allowing learners to tailor the complexity, format, or other properties of ChatGPT output, which could be explained by two possible reasons: On the one hand, learners with different L2 proficiency levels might have distinct preferences for the diversity of ChatGPT's outputs (Jeon & Lee, 2023), and the use of output cus. tomization would enable learners to modify the "one-size-fits-al output toaccommodate their personalized needs. On the other hand, the output customization assigning ChatGPT a persona (e.g., waiter and game partner, Jeon & Lee, 2023; hotel receptionist, Javier & Moorhouse, 2023) could take it s a waiter and a game partner to associate learning tasks with the authentic scenarios, which could facilitate learners' L2 use and improve their willingness to communicate (Yang & Li, 2024). Besides the high frequency of context control and output customization, while zero-shot prompting, error identification, and interaction were lesfrequently adopted, the feasibility of those prompt patterns for L2 learning remains open for debate, warranting further investigation in this regard.

Concerning the second research question, most studies focused on using ChatGPT for EFL learning, because English has been included as a compulsory subject in K-12 education and also been considered as an important skillin undergraduate and graduate programs among various non-English speaking countries (Shadiev & Yu, 2022). Results also indicated that ChatGPT was most frequently applied in higher education and teacher training, resonating Lo (2023) who maintained that most ChatGPT studies were conducted among college students. It comes as no surprise to observe that those researchers of ChatGPT for L2 leaners who are college teachers would recruit college students as their participants under investigation. Another possble explanation lies in that college students are also easier to gain ethics than those in pre-school, primary school or secondary education levels. The reason why primary and pre-school students were scarcely investigated is that ChatGPT usually generates texts with high syntactic complexity and lexical richness, which might pose challenges for primary students who are stil in the early stage of L2 learning to understand the output (Escalante et al., 2023). Most selected studies recruited participants of small sample sizes, probably because ChatGPT was recently released since the year 2022, and large-scale empirical investigations with larger samples might not be currently available.

Regarding the third research question, most ChatGPT studies were conducted under social, linguistic, cognitive, and other theories, since they could provide insights into the interplay between ChatGPT and L2 outcomes. In other words, researchers utilizing ChatGPT attempted to enhance learners social interactive (e.g, sociocultural theory, Rakhmonov & Kurbonova, 2023; experiential learning, Yan, 2023; social constructivism, Vera, 2023), linguisic (e.g., scalante et al., 2023; Imran & Lashari, 2023), and cognitive outcomes (e.g, motivation, Ali et al., 2023; autonomy, Agustini, 2023; behavioral intention, Cai et al., 2023), among others. Additionally, twenty-eight studies faled to ground on theoretical underpinnings due to researchers interest in exploring other aspects of ChatGPT, such as evaluation on ChatGPT output (e.g., Shin & Lee 2023; Zhou et al., 2023), eaures of ChatGPT feedback (Guo & Wang, 2023), and learners' ChatGPT use (Han et al., 2023; Javier & Moorhouse, 2023).

The fourth research question investigated objectives of the selected studies. Concerning language skill, ChatGPT was commonly adopte for the delomet of wting skils, ligng wth  t al. (2023, as it can ass ers in ddessing diloial, stctral, and linguistic chllenges in writing. Apart from writig skill, leaners' general skills were also frequently examined. Vera (2023) reported the use of ChatGPT for the development of learners' L2 performance and perceptions, and posited that due to ChatGPT's personalized, interactive, and engaging features, ChatGPT-based instruction could effctively enhance learners' language skil. Moreover, it indicated that learners' atitudes were most frequently investgated, such as general atitudes (Barret et al., 2023) satisfaction (Ahmed, 2023), motivation (Cai et al., 2023), and engagement (Le et al., 2023). For instance, Agustini (2023) postulated the argument that ChatGPT enhanced EFL learners motivation, confidence and autonomy by encouraging self-assessment, afording a non-judgmental learning environment and empowering personalized instruction.

Regarding the ifth research question, for qualitative methods, researchers would adopt open-ended questionnaires (Zulfa et al. 2023), interviews (Agustini, 2023; Ahmed, 2023), or log data (Javier & Moorhouse, 2023; Jeon & Lee, 2023) to explore students general atitudes towards ChatGPT (Imran & Lashari, 2023), satisfaction (Ahmed, 2023), motivation, autonomy, and confidence (Agustini, 2023). For quantitative methods, rearchers would adopt questionnaire surveys (Ali et al., 2023; Barrt e al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023) or tests (Vera, 2023) to understand ChatGPT's role in geeral language sils development (Vera, 2023) attitude (Barret et al., 2023), perceived learning, satisfaction, and engagement (Le et al., 2023), and technology accetance (Liu & Ma, 2024). Re searchers also adopted a number of mixed methods, such as close-ended questionnaires $^ +$ interviews (Nguyen, 2023), tests $^ +$ questionnaires (Escalante et al., 2023), and questionnaires $^ +$ interviews $^ +$ log data (Han et al., 2023), because they used multiple (quantitative $^ +$ qualitative) sources of data to further triangulate their research findings.

Lastly, the advantages together with challenges of ChatGPT use were obtained. Concerning advantages, enhancing language skils and learner perceptions received considerable atention. It was well-documented that ChatGPT could not only bolster learners general perceptions (e.g., Liu, 2023; Xia0 & Zhi, 2023; Yan, 2023), motivation (Agustini, 2023; Rakhmonov & Kurbonova, 2023), and engagement (Mohamed, 2024; Shahid et al., 2023); but also enhance their general language skill (e.g., gustini, 2023; Lashari et al., 2023; Vera, 2023) and writing skill (e.g., Athanassopoulos t al., 2023; Marzuki et al., 2023), fcilitate autonomous learning and L2 practice (Agustini, 2023; Bin-Hady et al., 2023; Mohamed, 2024), among others. On the other hand, challenges were also reported, such as plagiarism or privacy issues (Barret et al., 2023; Imran & Lashari, 2023), inaccurate or inappropriate responses (e.g, Mohamed, 2024; Nguyen, 2023; Riyadini & Triastuti, 2023), and leaners over-reliance n ChatGPT (e.g., Caiet al., 2023; Harunasari, 2022; Imran & Lashari, 2023). For instance, Yan (2023) reported that learners might copy ChatGPT-generated texts to complete writing assgnments, as ChatGPT could avoid plagiarism detection by producing seemingly original content It was also mentioned that ChatGPT might provide inaccurate and biased contextual information (Javier & Moorhouse, 2023; Mohamed, 2024), because it had limited understandings of cultural context and was pre-trained on data corpuses that contain biased or inaccurate information (L0, 2023). Marzuki et al. (2023) also criticized that learners might lean too heavily on ChatGPT for profreading, since its immediate feedback may undermine learners' motivation to check and thoroughly understand their mistakes.

# 6. Implications

# 6.1. Implications for teachers

First, since ChatGPT has potentially nnovated L2 learning, teachers should integrate ChatGPT into their teaching practice and utilize ito enhance L2 teaching processes. By using ChatGPT-powered tools and strategies, teachers can personalize 2 learning, improve L2 learning outcomes, and better prepare learners for success in the digital age. Second, since prompt patterns could help learners customize outputs and interactions with ChatGPT to meet their personalized needs (White et al., 2023), teachers should train learners how to adjust prompts through the use of context control and output customization (Jeon & Lee, 2023). Teachers could develop a customized plan for implementing ChatGPT that aligns with their L2 educational goals and train their learners regarding how to use a variety of ChatGPT prompts with the aid of the existing prompt lbrary. Third, to tackle with student plagiarism via ChatGPT (Li et al., 2023b; Liu, 2023), teachers should emphasize the importance of academic integrity, establish guidelines for appropriate ChatGPT use, and assign higher-order tasks that highlight the application, analysis, and creation of knowledge (Ansari et al., 2023; Lo, 2023). Fourth, despite ChatGPT's pedagogical affordances for L2 education, teachers should not only mitigate learners' potential riss of becoming over-reliant on ChatGPT, but also minimize the negative impacts on their problem-solving skils and critical awareness. One soution is to raise learners citical awareness of ChatGT's limitations (g, inaccurate or inappropriate output) and encourage them to use authoritative sources, evaluate and validate the factual correctness of ChatGPT-generated content (Barrot, 2023).

# 6.2. Implications for designers

First, since ChatGPT had imited background knowledge about learners' personalized needs (Guo & Wang, 2023), designers could consider incorporating ChatGPT into student information systems, analye student data, and deliver personalized material tailored to their individual ifferences, such as L2 proficiency, cognitive styles, and learning preferences (Li, 2022b, 2022c, 2023a; Yang & Li, 2024). Second, given that ChatGPT might generate iaccurate or biased output (Cai et al., 2023; Javier & Moorhouse, 2023), designers should guarantee the accuracy of ChatGPT responses and develop it with cultural sensitivit to avoid language biases and stereotypes (Mohamed, 2024; Zou & Huang, 2023). Third, designers should offr user-friendly interface with clear navigation, simplify ChatGPT operation, and interate gamified elements (Zou et al, 2021) to facilitate uman-computer interaction or collaboration with ChatGPT.

# 6.3. Implications for researchers

First, since learning theorie could inform what variables tend to affct ChatGPT's effectiveness and explicate how ChatGPT could be integrated into 2 curriculum (Li et al., 2021; Zou et al., 2022), researchers should explicitly tat the adopted social (socioculural, constructivism, and experiential learning), lingustic (input hypothesis, informal digital learning), and cognitie (self-determination theory, autonomy) theories in their future studies. Second, while a predominant focus has been paid on students of higher education, little is known about the effectiveness of ChatGPT for L2 learning among K-12 students. As such, researchers should not only investigate how ChatGPT could bolster K-12 students' perceptions (e.g., motivatio, satisfaction and engagement) and facilitate their language skills (Meng & Li, 2023), but also develop their AI competencies regarding the ethical use, potential benefits and riss of utilizing ChatGPT for L2 learning. Third, given that most studies employed questionnaire survey and interviews to explore learners attitudes towards ChatGPT, future study may adopt pre-/postes experimental designs or other mixed methods t triangulate findings of ChatGPT for L2 learning. Fourth, as L2 learners are likely to be over-reliant on ChatGPT's desired outputs generation that would pose challenges to their higher-order thinking skill (Kohnke et al., 2023), future research could investgate ChatGPT's long-term influence in L2 learners' critical awareness, creativity, and problem-solving skills.

# 7. Conclusion

This study indicated that ChatGPT was frequently adopted for content generation, feedback, and teaching support i L2 learning. The majority of learners utilized such prompt patterns as context control and output customization to elicit effective output. Most studies employed ChatGPT for EFL learners in higher education institutions and adopted small sample sizes. The majorit of studies focused on learners' general atitudes/perceptions and writig skill. Sociocultural theory, social constructivism, and technology acceptance model were more frequently adopted than other theories. Most studies used qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods, with a particular eye n questionnair surveys, interviews, log data and written texts. Lastly, detailed llustrations of advantages and challenges were reported as well. The current study could not only contribute to presenting a panoramic vision about ChatGPT for L2 learning, but also inform future research and pedagogy in relation to ChatGPT role, prompt patterns, learning theories, methodology, advantages and challenges.

Despite those promising findings, there were several limitations as well. First, this study only considered journal articles and conference proceedings for analysis. Future research may include other types of literature, such as PhD dissertations and monograph chapters. Second, since this study only involved such dimensions as ChatGPT's roles and prompt patterns, participants, objectives. theories, methodology, and outcomes, future endeavor could consider other important coding categories, such as role of learners individual differences and application effectiveness.
