# Abstract

One of the key means by which knowledge is disseminated in the academic discourse community is the spoken presentation of papers at an academic conference. In contrast to the written research article, the spoken presentation remains relatively under-researched from a linguistic perspective, limiting the knowledge available for explicating this kind of discourse in academic language programs. In this paper, we draw on a social semiotic theory of language (Systemic Functional Linguistics) and of gesture, to frame a multi-layered exploration of interpersonal meaning in this register that incorporates attention to generic staging, to expressions of attitude, and to the coexpression of attitudinal language and gesture. The data are a set of plenary presentations at an academic conference, and the study aims to explore means by which the speakers construe a relationship of solidarity with their audiences in the introductory or ‘set-up’ stage of their talk.

# 1. Introduction

The context for a spoken academic conference presentation may range from an invited plenary to a short parallel paper or workshop. In terms of audience, the forum may vary from one that is large in size and mixed in expertise to a small group of colleagues and fellow experts. The paper may also present research at various levels of completion, from work in progress to post-publication dissemination, and the presentation is likely to represent just one step on what Ventola (2002) refers to as a ‘semiotic spanning’ across a sequence of events. Across the varied contexts of spoken conference presentations there are, nonetheless, a number of features that are likely to be characteristic of the discourse. In most instances, for example, the oral performance is strongly associated with the development of a parallel written text. As such, a spoken conference presentation is likely to be a highly reflective text with many features that correspond to written research writing. On the other hand, there is an immediacy of audience in time and in place. This suggests a pressure in the other direction, towards a more interactive text, as the writer shapes the message in ways intended to connect with the immediate context.

In our research, we consider this latter characteristic of the discourse. We explore ways in which speakers shape their talk to (inter)act interpersonally with their audience, to setup a relationship of solidarity. The data we analyse in this paper are plenary presentations, and we focus on the initial stage, referred to as the set-up. Our assumption is that this initial stage will represent a valuable site for exploring the discourse strategies speakers employ to resolve inherent tensions and to construe a relationship of solidarity or rapport with their audience. These inherent tensions exist, for example, around the status of the speaker as relative expert in their field, and the fact that the success of the presentation rests largely on audience approval and a positive judgement or appreciation of the speaker’s contribution. From the point of view of the audience, there is a tension to be resolved in terms of the extent to which they feel accommodated in the presentation, as part of the relevant discourse community, off-set against the cost of attendance.

To date, the extensive and rapidly growing body of literature on the language of research reporting has been overwhelmingly focused on reporting in a written form, for example as research articles, theses, essays or proposals. Some of this research focuses specifically on interpersonal meanings, on evaluative stance and on ways in which the reader is taken account of in the written text (e.g., Hunston & Thompson, 2000; Hyland, 1998). Literature which addresses the spoken dimension of research as seminar or conference presentations, is often in the form of pedagogic guides targeted primarily to undergraduate or graduate students (e.g., Madden & Rohlck, 1997), or is focused on business or professional settings (e.g., Kline, 2004). Valuable contributions to applied linguistic research into the language of academic conference presentation include studies by Thompson (1997) who compares interactive features found in research articles and presentations, and Charles and Ventola (2002) who address connections within the presentation between the spoken text and the visuals of the slide show. They discuss, for example, how in referring to contextualising slides, the speaker’s evaluative language functions to bring the speaker and the audience closer together as they share emotive responses. The interpersonal aspect of conference presentations is also addressed in Frobert-Adamo (2002) who points to the important function that humour plays in this kind of interaction.

Also informing this study is a body of research within Systemic Functional Linguistic (SFL) theory that considers interpersonal meaning across different kinds of texts, both spoken and written (e.g., Eggins & Slade, 1997; Martin & Rose, 2003; White, 2003). The theory enables us to explore the ways in which interpersonal meanings are encoded in a whole range of grammatical and lexical choices, and most importantly how they pattern and flow across texts. The notion of interpersonal meaning as one of the three metafunctions of language (along with the ideational and the textual) also provides us with a semiotic framework to explore meaning-making beyond language. Because SFL theory models language as social semiotic (Halliday, 1978), that is, as a social meaning-making system, it has provided a theoretical foundation for studies of other social semiotic systems, notably those of visual image (Kress & van Leeuwen, 1996), gesture and positioning (e.g., Martinec, 2000, 2001), and space (Martin and Stenglin, 2005). The common theoretical basis for modelling these different semiotics provides for integrated multimodal discourse studies, where meaning is seen to be constructed both through different semiotic systems, but also importantly in the interaction of these different systems (e.g., van Leeuwen, 2005). In this study, we aim to incorporate a multimodal analysis of interpersonal meanings by considering the role of gesture alongside that of language (Kendon, 2004; Martinec, 2004). Whereas gesture is most typically used to refer to movements of the hands and arms, we also incorporate analysis of both head and facial movements, for example, nodding, and raising of eyebrows, that co-occur with speech (Scollon, 1995).

Drawing on Kendon (2004) and Martinec (2004) we interpret gesture as intimately connected to language, as a kind of embodied expression that is integral to the utterance. In this sense, we could consider parallels to phonology on ‘the expression plane’ of language (Halliday, 1994). Phonology itself would clearly add a further dimension to research such as we undertake here, but for reasons of space we have chosen to focus on the less well explored resources of gesture.

While gesture can be studied from many perspectives, we are concerned in this study with the co-occurrence of gestures with interpersonal choices in the language of the speaker, and in particular with how they function in relation to expressions of attitude. It is important to note that, as with the interpretation of interpersonal meanings encoded in language, we acknowledge the possibility of varied reader positions related to our social and cultural positioning. We also note that our focus is on the construal of meanings through the discourse of the text, with reference to a comprehensive theory of language and gesture as social semiotic. There is no attention given in the design of this research to issues of evaluation of the effectiveness of any of the presentations.

# 2. The study

Our research explores features of language and gesture in a set of five conference plenary presentations in English at a language testing conference in Hong Kong in 1998. The conference involved plenary papers only, presented by a group of invited speakers, all experts within their field. The audience numbered approximately forty including the presenters. As such it represented a relatively intimate conference setting.

The conference presentations were audio and videotaped, then transcribed and claused. An initial analysis of generic structure identified a set-up stage in each presentation. The boundary between the set-up stage and the main body of the presentation is signalled in all cases by discourse markers such as “well,” “OK,” “right,” “alright,” and/or by lexis signalling the shift, for example: “let’s get started,” “let me start then by.,” “alright so now,” “one of the first issues,” as well as in marked shifts in aspects of gesture or positioning. The set-up stage functions on the one hand to situate the talk in the immediate context, and on the other to provide the point of departure for the presentation ‘proper’. In this study, we focus on a more detailed analysis of this stage in each talk, and in particular on interpersonal meanings in the discourse. Towards this end, we undertake a closer analysis of sub-staging or phases within this stage of the genre, and an analysis of expressions of attitude and how these expressions pattern across the discourse. Video data were used to analyse and develop categorisations of facial, head and hand gestures, and descriptions of gesture were aligned with the corresponding language on transcriptions of the data.

# 3. Genre and interpersonal meaning

An analysis of the generic structuring of the texts reveals that while the set-up stage itself is evident in all the presentations, there is considerable variation in how this stage is realised across the different presentations. Table 1 provides a summary representation of the length (with the number of words shown brackets) and identifiable sub-stages of each set-up.

In terms of length, S3 is the shortest text at only 14 words. Yet, in this brief set-up we can identify three components that include thanking the convenor, thanking the audience, and signalling the transition to the talk proper: “Thank you very much (convenor’s name) /Thank you very much everybody/Let’s get started.” The longest text, S4’s extended 695 word set-up, also includes thanks to the convenor and ends with a transition to the presentation proper. However, in addition the speaker identifies the topic, contextualises the presentation, previews the content and structure of the talk, and includes references to the contribution of others who are present as well as a number of jokes. If we take a metafunctional orientation to the identified stages we could argue that five of the six speakers include at least one sub-stage which foregrounds ideational meanings (identify topic, or contextualise research), one sub-stage which foregrounds textual meaning (preview structure of presentation; signal transition to next stage) and one sub-stage which foregrounds interpersonal meaning (introduce, greet/thank; refer to contribution of others; joke). In this sense these set-up stages function in accordance with Martin’s (1992) notion of Macro-theme, functioning as predictive of the presentation as a whole. Speaker S3, noted above as having the shortest set-up stage, does not include any ideational orientation, that is, he does not indicate the topic of the talk in this stage. This presentation is also the only one in which the speaker read a paper. In this case, the paper proper begins with a statement of the content focus. Examples of instantiations at each sub-stage are included in Table 2.

An analysis of moves or sub-stages in the genre enables us to identify particular phases of text in which interpersonal meaning is foregrounded, for example, in phases of thanking or joking (see Eggins & Slade, 1997; Frobert-Adamo, 2002). However, this does not take us far enough. We know that interpersonal meanings pattern prosodically in texts (Halliday, 1994; Martin, 1992). They spread across the discourse rather than being confined to discrete generic stages, or specific grammatical or lexical instantiations. So we expect to find interpersonally loaded language throughout the talk. Of interest is the ways these meanings pattern in the text, and how they shift from one phase of text to another.

# 4. Discourse semantics and interpersonal meaning

The next stage of analysis, then, is to consider interpersonal meaning from a discourse semantic perspective, and here we make reference to Appraisal theory (Martin & Rose, 2003) as represented in Fig. 1.

The system of Engagement, referred to in Fig. 1, has to do with the space that is opened up or closed down to other voices in the text-the degree to which a text is relatively monoglossic or heteroglossic (after Bakhtin, 1935/1981; see White, 2003). The extent to which speakers allow space for negotiation of meanings into their talk, even as monologic text, construes the listener as having more or less potential to ‘interact’ with the presentation. Opening up heteroglossic space might be expected to encourage the inclusion of the audience. Within Appraisal theory one resource for Engagement is the projection of others’ words into the text, either in direct quotation or as in the following cases, indirectly.

Table 2 Examples of each sub-stage of the introductory section   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Sub-stage</td><td>Example text</td></tr><tr><td>Introduce co-presenter</td><td>I&#x27;m co-presenting with xx,.. [S1a]</td></tr><tr><td>Introduce self</td><td>I haven&#x27;t got anyone to introduce me, but probably during your second day here in this room, you got a general idea of who I am. For those of you who only came today, I&#x27;m xx...

[S4].</td></tr><tr><td>Joke/humour</td><td>Okay, I&#x27;m just giving myself a two-item criterion reference test. Can see paper, but cannot see audience [laughter]. Can see audience, but cannot see paper</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>[laughter]. Ah, I have to make a high stakes decision here. (I&#x27;m going) for option A. Can see paper, but cannot see audience. Um, so you&#x27;ll excuse the blank stare</td></tr><tr><td>Signal transition to next</td><td>on my face. ...[S4] Right. Quickly into the background. [S2]</td></tr></table></body></html>

S4: .we’ve heard that from a lot of previous speakers.   
S2: .xx mentioned earlier that their program is ..

However, such references to other speakers are unlikely to engage the audience as a whole. More common in the data are ways of signalling degrees of openness to other unspecified voices through uses of modality and counter-expectancy (Martin & Rose, 2003). In the following extracts, for example, the speakers construe propositions as in negotiation with other voices through encoding modality as possibility or inclination (underlined). In the same examples, counter-expectancy markers (boxed) also function to imply the other countered voice (Martin & Rose, 2003).

So, basically what I want to do is to take you through a series of ah if you like very very tentative generalisations.

S2: and so I’d like to give you a quick background

S1b: I suppose one of the first issues.

Our focus from a discourse semantic perspective is with how these kinds of choices pattern in the text, and as the examples above suggest, we find that within the set-up stage these choices occur predominantly in phases of the text where the speaker is previewing or transitioning to the content of their presentation. The speakers present their own contribution as one position among others, and in the process they provide space for an audience that may well include some whose views do not readily align with their own. (For a much more extensive exploration of the Engagement dimension of Appraisal see White, 2003, and Martin & White, 2005).

The other key dimension to Appraisal theory (as represented in Fig. 1) is that of Attitude. Martin and Rose (2003) suggest that expressions of attitude play a key role in aligning people in relationships of solidarity. We focus particular attention, therefore, on how and where attitude is expressed in the discourse. Attitude is analysed as representing either Affect—the expression of feelings or emotions, Judgement—the valuing of people’s character or behaviour, or Appreciation—the valuing of things, events, phenomenon. One feature of this evaluative lexis is that it can be graded up or down in value. The grading of evaluative meanings is referred to in Fig. 2 as Graduation (see Hood, 2004, and Hood & Martin, 2005, for a detailed system of options in Graduation). In the following instances of graded Appreciation, the explicit Attitude is in bold and the Graduation is in italics.

S1a: .areas that are certainly for me are quite interesting S2: .I’d be very interested in feedback S4: .things .which are of great interest

An analysis of explicit Attitude in the data reveals that there is a strong attitudinal orientation to the set-up stage of each presentation. Explicit Attitude is expressed as Appreciation, as in

S4: . A very high-stakes form of assessment ( $^ +$ valuation) S4: . this research is not going particularly well (Kvaluation) S5: . the pre-eminent locus for research ( $^ +$ valuation)

as Affect, for example

S1a: . I am pleased to be able to introduce. ( $^ +$ happiness)   
S2: .it normally gets people amused ( $^ +$ happiness)   
S3: .thank you very much ( $^ +$ happiness)   
S4: .I also enjoy coming back to Hong Kong ( $^ +$ happiness)   
S5: . I always wanted to sit in the Vice Chancellor’s chair. ( $^ +$ desire)

and as Judgement, as in

S2: . sorry to be officious (Kcapacity) S2: . because we abuse each other (Kpropriety) S4: .the blank stare on my face (Kcapacity) S4: .I have to confess (Kpropriety)

Affect encodes feelings and emotions, and Judgement encodes the evaluation of people and their behaviour. It can be argued that Attitude expressed as Affect or Judgement is, therefore, in a sense more personal than Appreciation that is to do with the institutionalisation of Affect in the realm of aesthetics, and the valuing of things. Expressions of Affect or Judgement in the discourse therefore contribute to a more personal stance on the part of the presenter.

A further step in an analysis of Appraisal is to consider patterns in the data in terms of what is being appraised, and how. To this point, we have considered the explicit encoding of evaluation in terms that carry an intrinsic positive or negative value (e.g. interesting $^ +$ ; blank $-$ ). This explicit expression of value is referred to as inscribed Attitude. However, we also need to consider the potential for language choices to imply an evaluative reading even though there is no explicit inscription of value. In analysing the data in this study for choices that flag an attitudinal reading, we draw on Hood (2004) who identifies the key role played by resources of Graduation in this respect. As Hood identifies, when speakers grade a meaning that is not in itself attitudinal, that is where they grade some objective meaning of, for example, quantity or location, they give that meaning a subjective slant. The listener is clued in to interpreting the meaning as evaluative in some respect, as implying a value. So, for example, when presenter S4 refers to the fact that “an awful lot of things” have been happening in a particular place, the grading up of quantity in “an awful lot” encourages an interpretation that the location is significant in some way. A similar evaluative interpretation is evoked when issues are described as “common to all sorts of educational systems” (S4).

A detailed analysis of what is appraised and how it is appraised is presented in Table 3 for the set-up stage for S4. The categories of Appraised are in column 1. Column 2 lists the instances of both explicit Attitude (bold) as well as instances where the grading of nonattitudinal meanings evokes an attitudinal interpretation (italics). Column 3 identifies the instance as either inscribed (Ins) or evoked (Ev). The fourth column identifies the Attitude as positive $( + )$ or negative $( - )$ , as Affect (Aff), Appreciation (App) or Judgement (Jud) and as subcategories of each (see Martin, 2000). In these data, subcategories include Affect as happiness (hap) and desire (des); Appreciation as valuation (val), composition (comp) or reaction (react); and Judgement as tenacity (ten), capacity (cap), veracity (ver), or propriety (prop).

Table 3 reveals patterns in the distribution of different kinds of Attitude. Of note, for example, is the strong preference for inscribed Affect and Judgement in the presenter’s evaluations of himself or his audience. This is in sharp contrast to the dominance of evoked Appreciation in reference to the presenter’s own paper, or to other research in the field. The presenter’s own research is flagged as positive and other research most often as negative (c.f. Hood, 2004 on Attitude in written research paper introductions). The knowledge domain, that is the world that is being researched, is initially evaluated indirectly, but this builds progressively in the discourse and culminates in a strengthening of the negative Appreciation, in “demands”; “new demands”; “increased demands,” and finally in negative Judgement in “impose.”

.What for example, teachers thought of them, how it changed teachers’ practices, how administrators used the information which was yielded by these systems and how people on a day to day basis were managing to handle the demands of assessment, new demands, increased demands that such systems imposed on them.

The evaluation of the knowledge domain functions to establish the presenters’ contribution as worthwhile in that it is addressing a problematic field.

Resources for encoding Attitude function in different ways in different phases of the discourse, establishing different kinds of interpersonal relationships between presenter and audience. In some phases of the set-up, for example in thanking the audience, expressions of Affect encourage a positive solidarity of a shared sense of well-being (happiness). In previewing the presentation, positive Affect encourages a rapport of positive anticipation (desire). In referring to the location of the conference, the audience is strongly encouraged, we could say compelled, to align with the speaker’s explicit positive Appreciation. In other phases of the discourse, the encouragement is less explicit. In relation to the content of the talk, the audience is encouraged to align both through an implied positive Appreciation of the presenter’s own contribution as well as through some negative Appreciation of the contribution of others. The resources of Attitude function not only to make interpersonal connections with the audience, but sometimes overtly and sometimes subtly and implicitly to align the audience with the speaker’s position.

A closer look at each category of Appraised in Table 3 can reveal more about the presenter’s strategies for alignment. One interesting feature that emerges in the presenter S4’s evaluations of himself is the number of instances of positive Judgement as tenacity (e.g. ‘for 16 or 17 years’) accompanied by instances of negative Judgement as capacity (e.g. blank stare; not. well). Negative self-evaluations might at first seem somewhat out of place in a talk by an expert in the field. The impact of this apparent disjunction of values in the context is, however, to elicit laughter from the audience, as it is apparently interpreted as self-deprecating humour (see Eggins & Slade, 1997 on humour and disjunctive meanings). This text corresponds to our identification of a joke phase in the set-up. In this context, the expertise of the speaker is not in dispute, and the disjunction functions to support solidarity in shared humour. In a different context, for example where a presenter is discussing the research that is the basis of the main body of their presentation, or where the presenter has less acknowledged expertise, a quite different reaction might result.

A discourse semantic perspective on Attitude, allows us to account for the fact that evaluative language can be encoded across multiple systems of lexicogrammar, as is evident in the examples in Table 3. It also allows us to consider how different resources interact with each other across the discourse, how they co-pattern in phases of the genre, and how values are developed throughout the text. Such a perspective offers an important alternative and complementary take on interpersonal meanings from the quantification achieved in corpus studies.

# 5. Gesture and interpersonal meaning

To this point, we have considered an analysis of phases in the set-up stage of conference paper presentations as well as the discourse semantic patterning of expressions of Attitude across the stage. The next step in our analysis is to move beyond language to consider the co-expression of interpersonal meanings in the semiotic of gesture.

The discussion in this section is based on an analysis of gesture as facial, head, and hand movements that co-occur with speech, resulting in a comprehensive though not exhaustive categorization of movements. Analyses reveal that the extent and nature of the gestures used vary markedly from speaker to speaker. Speaker 5, for example, was seated behind a desk and used minimal gesture. Others, such as Speaker 2, were standing away from furniture and were highly animated, using a wide range of hand gestures with high frequency. The variations suggest both individual and contextual variables in the extent of use of gesture. However, our primary focus is on patterns in the co-occurrence of gesture with language. Following Martinec (2001), we consider the role of gestures metafunctionally, and in this paper the focus is on how gestures function interpersonally. We map the gestures on to the corresponding clauses and wordings identified within phases and stages of the text, in order to identify correspondences between gesture and interpersonal resources of language. This is illustrated in an extract from S4 in Table 4. Such an analysis enables an exploration of ways in which the two semiotic systems of language and gesture relate in the construal of interpersonal meaning.

Analyses reveal several ways in which gesture functions interpersonally in relation to language choices. There are instances where gestures function to signal stance in a phase of discourse, before that stance is signalled linguistically. That is, the gestures encourage the audience to interpret what is about to be said in a particular way. In Table 4, 10.1, the speaker initiates an episode of humour through the use of gesture, with a subtle shift in facial expressions. The speaker raises an eyebrow as he begins this phase of discourse. A similar gesture accompanies the commencement of a second episode of humour in 13.2. For this speaker, the eyebrow raise seems to function as a discourse marker, signalling shifts in orientation from the serious to the humorous.

There are also instances where the speaker’s gestures and language are semantically parallel. An expression of explicit positive Affect, such as ‘thank’ is paralleled in a gesture that embodies pleasure, typically a smile. The co-articulation in language and gesture can be interpreted as a kind of amplification of the positive Affect. In Table 4, 14.2, a downward turned mouth and dropped head amplify the negative Appreciation encoded in ‘not . particularly well,’ by embodying an additional meaning of negative Affect, of disappointment.

There are many other instances where expressions of explicit Attitude are accentuated by an accompanying gesture. There are also instances where the implication of attitude is strengthened in this way. For example, in 10.1 the speaker’s utterance ‘big’ is accompanied by a quick up–down nod of head, further encouraging the listener to interpret this as evaluative. However, while we can argue that in the phase of text below, the graded experiential meanings (underlined) encourage an evaluative interpretation, they do not explain the audience’s laughter:

And every time I come back here there is something new and something big that is happening (laughter)

An explanation of the audience reaction can, however, be explained with reference to the accompanying gestures. The raised eyebrow on ‘every,’ the half smile embracing ‘new,’ and the nod to exaggerate ‘big’ all function to signal playful, cynical surprise. The speaker’s full smile in response to the audience laughter confirms their interpretation. Speaker and audience commune in a shared response to the object of appraisal.

Interestingly, both the episodes of humour discussed above are immediately preceded by a gaze that scans the audience back and forth (9.1–9.2, and 13.1). We could interpret this kind of gesture as an embodiment of projection, as the speaker bodily constructs the audience in its entirety as interlocutor for the forthcoming phases of discourse, phases that culminate in audience participation in laughter. Gestures that function to construct all members of the audience as interactants in this way have parallels in the resources of Engagement discussed earlier. They function to establish inclusivity.

This account of some of the ways in which gesture functions in relation to language in the construal of interpersonal meaning is necessarily very brief. It serves only to highlight the importance of considering interpersonal meaning-making beyond language itself, and alongside language. We have indicated, for example, some ways in which we can consider the interpersonal function of gesture in relation to Appraisal, in the expression of Attitude, Graduation and Engagement. However, more research is needed on the ways in which gesture can expand the meaning potential of the speaker, interpersonally as well as ideationally and textually.

# 6. Conclusion

In this study, we identify a number of rhetorical strategies that speakers draw on in the set-up stage of conference presentations, as they aim to connect with and align their audience in a shared face-to-face context for dissemination of academic knowledge. We identify ways in which particular stages or phases of discourse foreground interpersonal over ideational meanings, how resources of Appraisal can represent a speaker’s position as more or less open to negotiation, and can encourage a sense of solidarity around shared attitudes and values, and we consider how gesture can function, in tandem with language, to encourage an alignment of the audience with the speaker. When these resources are considered together we can begin to see the complex nature of the rhetorical strategies employed by speakers in resolving tensions and in helping to construe a positive relationship of solidarity with their audiences. The resources are rich and their interrelationships are complex, considerably more complex than is presented in prescriptive do’s and don’ts in some pedagogic contexts. Yet, while we would argue the value in advanced academic literacy programs of modelling and deconstructing the discourse to see how connections between speaker and audience are intensified or diminished, and how they change in nature from one phase to another as the talk unfolds, we acknowledge the need for a great deal more exploration of how such insights can inform teaching/training practices. We also acknowledge that in this paper we focus on just the initial stage of a small selection of plenary presentations. More extensive research is needed across a range of contexts and speaker expertise.
