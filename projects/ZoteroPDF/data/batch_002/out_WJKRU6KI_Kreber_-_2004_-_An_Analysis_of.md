# An Analysis of Two Models of Reflection and their Implications for Educational Development

Carolin Kreber\* University of Alberta, Canada

Reflection has become a buzzword in the education literature. Differences in the conceptualizations of reflection underlying different studies and lack of theorizing over how these frameworks relate to one another, however, can diminish the contributions such studies can make to our understanding of educational development in higher education. This article considers two models of reflection, Mezirow’s (1990, 1991) theory of transformative learning and Zimmerman and Schunk’s (1998) notion of self-regulated learning, and explores how each can enhance our understanding of educational development in tertiary settings. The assumptions each theory makes about the validity of the outcomes of the reflective process are addressed. Two recent qualitative studies, each informed by one of two theories of reflection, are discussed with the goal of making a first attempt at addressing the lack of theorizing over the meaning of findings from different studies. The article concludes with concrete suggestions for future research on reflection and the practice of educational development.

# Introduction

The notion of reflection has been widely researched in the field of teacher education for the past two decades (for example, Calderhead, 1989; Hatton & Smith, 1995; Zeichner, 1986) and more recently many conceptual and empirical studies have appeared that explore why and how reflection plays an important role in academic staff members’ pedagogical growth (for example, Amundsen, Saroyan, & Frankman, 1996; Brookfield, 1995; Cranton, 1996, 1998; Kreber, 2000; McAlpine, Weston, Beauchamp, Wiseman, & Beaucamp, 1999; McAlpine & Weston, 2000; Ramsden, 1992; Saroyan, Amundsen, & Li, 1997; Trigwell, Martin, Benjamin, & Prosser, 2000). Given that reflection has been described as “poorlydefined” (Moon, 2000) and as being “used rather loosely to embrace a wide range of concepts and strategies” (Hatton & Smith, 1995), it is not surprising that different studies espouse very different conceptualizations of reflection. Such differences, however, make it difficult to see how these inquiries into academics’ reflection on teaching might inform, let alone build on, each other. Though many of these studies are very thought-provoking in their methodological approaches and findings, as a whole they contribute only in a limited way to our understanding of how reflection may improve teaching practice and, by extension, to the design of educational development initiatives intended to promote reflection on teaching. This will remain true unless a deliberate attempt is made to identify the definition of reflection underlying individual studies and to explore how their respective findings might be linked.

In this article I introduce two recent qualitative studies that explored the extent to which full-time academic staff members reflect on their teaching. The first study applied the lens of transformative learning theory (Mezirow, 1990, 1991) and the second that of self-regulated learning theory (Zimmerman & Schunk, 1998). The main purpose of the article is not to disseminate the results of these studies, which has been done elsewhere (Kreber, 2004; Kreber, Castleden, Erfani, & Wright, in press), but to draw on them as examples from which to theorize. I begin by comparing the two theories and discuss the assumptions each makes about the outcomes of reflection. Specifically, for each of the models, I will address the issue of validity of the outcomes of the reflective process. If the outcomes of reflection do not constitute valid knowledge about teaching, one might ask, how would such reflection be valuable? I will address the contributions each model makes to our understanding of educational development and explore the question of whether reflection, as defined by either one of these models, necessarily leads to valid knowledge about teaching. Then I will turn to a discussion of the actual findings from both research projects with the intent of relating the two separate studies, each espousing a different conceptual framework, to one another. Rather than focusing on each study on its own terms, the goal in this article is to present a first attempt at addressing the above-mentioned problem of lack of theorizing over the findings from different studies on reflection. I will discuss how future research may build on these findings and conclude with some suggestions for how to promote forms of reflection that promise to yield valid knowledge about teaching, and, at least in theory, lead to good teaching practice.

# Academics Reflecting on Teaching

# The First Study

In the first study, thirty-six instructors participated in individual interviews based on Kreber and Cranton’s (2000) scholarship of teaching model, a model that they deduced from Mezirow’s transformation theory. Each also completed a repertory grid (described below). Of the thirty-six participants, thirty had more than ten years of experience as an academic staff member and six had less than two years of experience.

The theoretical framework. Mezirow (1991) distinguishes between three kinds of reflection: on content, process and premises. In clarifying the distinction between them he contends: “We may reflect on the content or description of a problem …, the process or method of our problem solving, or the premise $( s )$ upon which the problem is predicated” (Mezirow, 1991, p. 117, italics in original). Simply put, when engaged in content reflection we ask “what do I know?” and when involved in process reflection we ask “how do I know my method of problem-solving works/if I am effective with what I do?”. Finally, when engaged in premise reflection we question the presuppositions underlying our knowledge. We would engage in critical reflection or in double-loop learning (Argyris & Schön, 1974) and ask “why does it matter that I attend to this problem, does it matter that I chose this problem, is there an alternative?”. Note that in content reflection we basically draw on what we presently know or believe. As such, content reflection is a process in which we “are not attending to the grounds or justification for our beliefs but are simply using our beliefs to make an interpretation” (Mezirow, 1991, p. 107). In other words, whether our knowledge is valid is not a question that is posed through content reflection.

The scholarship of teaching model (Kreber, 1999; Kreber & Cranton, 2000) proposes that individuals who learn about teaching engage in content, process and premise reflection in three different domains of teaching knowledge. The three domains are instructional, pedagogical and curricular knowledge. Instructional knowledge is concerned with various aspects of instructional design and the instructional process, for example, writing and sequencing learning objectives, planning lectures, choosing readings, facilitating discussions and group work, preparing PowerPoint presentations, designing overheads, preparing syllabi, constructing tests, evaluating examinations, etc. These are the basic things teachers do. Instructional knowledge, at least in theory, is the logical consequence of what was called pedagogical knowledge. Pedagogical knowledge is knowledge about how students learn. It is inclusive of Shulman’s (1987) pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) but it also addresses pedagogical questions that go beyond the discipline and PCK. These include questions such as how to respond to different learning styles and approaches to studying, how to facilitate critical thinking and self-management in learning, or how to influence students’ motivation to learn. Curricular knowledge is knowledge of the goals, purposes and rationales for our classes, courses or programs. It includes, for example, knowledge of how a particular course fits into the larger curriculum and how our teaching contributes to the university’s societal and cultural role. Ideally, the instructional strategies we use are based on our understanding of how students learn and are influenced also by our understanding of the purposes, goals and rationale for our courses and programs. In summary, the model suggests that academics can engage in content, process or premise reflection in each of the three knowledge domains, yielding nine different forms of reflection.

What constitutes valid knowledge according to this model? Let us now consider the assumptions this model makes about the outcomes of reflection. In doing so, it is necessary to explore Mezirow’s notion of transformative learning in somewhat greater depth. Borrowing heavily from Habermas’s (1971) theory of knowledge-constitutive interests, Mezirow distinguishes three different forms of learning, which he labels instrumental, communicative and emancipatory. Instrumental learning relies heavily on the empirical-analytical method and as such is basically about testing a hypothesis. A belief or assertion then could be verified by subjecting it to the empirical-analytical method; that is by posing it as a hypothesis that can be tested by gathering data that will either support or defeat it. Communicative learning, on the other hand, relies on the notion that through communication with others we can reach a common understanding or consensus on what is true. An assertion or belief is valid, therefore, if agreement on it can be reached within a community. Obviously, consensus then is based on what the community at some point has accepted as the norm. While communicative learning is very valuable if the goal is to reach greater understanding within a framework of given norms, communicative learning does not concern itself with the question of how these norms have come about. Simply put, through communicative learning we do not ask “why did we ever say that this should be this way?”. In addressing this problem, Mezirow suggests that important aspects of learning do not occur on the basis of subjective understanding and consensus within a given social context but involve a critical analysis of how certain norms and conditions have come about. This is the nature of emancipatory learning (see Kreber & Cranton, 2000). Depending on the kind of reflection individuals engage in, the nature of their learning will vary. It might be instrumental, communicative or emancipatory or some combination thereof.

Let’s look at some examples. When we are engaged in content reflection our thinking may proceed like this: “The problem I need to solve here is clarifying my goals (I describe the content of the problem and this time for the domain of curricular knowledge) and my main goal is to encourage deep approaches to learning”. “The problem I need to solve here is to help students engage in deep approaches to learning (here, again, I describe the content of the problem but this time for the domain of pedagogical knowledge) and I do this by providing them with choice, challenge, control and collaboration in their learning tasks” (for example, Donald, 1997). “The problem I need to solve here is (for example) to provide students with choices (here I describe the content of the problem I need to address in the domain of instructional knowledge) and I do this by using learning contracts”. What is given at this level is merely a description of a problem and how it is habitually solved by us. Content reflection gets at what we presently know or believe. As such it actually does not constitute learning but rather remembering or drawing on what we know. Clearly, while we may just recall what we already know (as the above examples demonstrate), we may go on to further enhance our knowledge by recording what we do in a teaching journal, discussing alternative ideas about teaching with colleagues, or reading a book or articles on good teaching practice. The nature of our learning then becomes both instrumental and communicative. In the conceptual model that was developed by Kreber and Cranton (2000) a few years back content reflection was considered as a form of learning. Recently, this conceptualization seems to have shifted somewhat (for example, Kreber, 2001).

To stay with the domain of instructional knowledge for demonstration purposes, we engage in process reflection as we ask “How effective have I been in using these methods?”. Leaning on the above example, I may ask “Was my use of learning contracts effective in providing students with choices?”. In exploring this, we might collect data from students on how they liked working with learning contracts, ask a colleague to give us some feedback, or look for evidence of its effectiveness in the available literature on teaching. The nature of our learning then is both instrumental and communicative. On the one hand we try to predict how students will respond to our teaching methods (here the use of learning contracts) and on the other we try to learn through interactions with others whether we are on track with what we believe is true.

We engage in premise or critical reflection on instructional knowledge as we ask “Why does it matter that I use this method (here learning contracts). Is there an alternative?”. At this point we might compare different instructional strategies for their suitability in a given context, discuss teaching approaches with a colleague and change approaches as a result, or experiment with different instructional strategies, keeping track of the results, and making changes if results so suggest. Our learning in this case could be instrumental, communicative, and emancipatory. Through critical questioning we might develop a more open and discriminating perspective on teaching methods, a feature of emancipatory learning. Figure 1 provides a visual illustration of this model. It should be stressed that the term “critical reflection” has been shown to mean different things to different people. Hatton and Smith (1995) report that for some scholars “critical reflection” refers to no more than constructive self-criticism while for others it implies considerations of ethical and moral criteria such as equity and respect, and again for others, locating analyses of personal action within wider socio-historical and politico-cultural contexts.

The Scholarship of Teaching (SofT) Model (adapted from Kreber & Cranton, 2000) Content, process and premise reflection in the three knowledge domains Mezirow has been criticized for discussing “emancipatory learning” without paying sufficient attention to the latter. Specifically, Clark and Wilson (1991) suggested that although Mezirow’s transformation theory borrows heavily from Habermas’s formulation of critical theory, it does so very selectively and in the end “fails to maintain the essential link between the meaning of experience and the context in which it arises and by which it is interpreted” (p. 76). This is to say that though Mezirow’s notion of critical or premise reflection involves calling into question underlying presuppositions we have come to take for granted, it does not necessarily imply a critique of ideology and considerations of how historical, political and social contexts influence human experiences (though it may include these processes, of course).

To sum up, what, according to this model, then constitutes true or valid knowledge in teaching? Obviously, content reflection does not address the question of validity of the outcomes of reflection. Process and premise reflection, however, get at the notion of validity testing. In process reflection we find out whether what we do works by seeking some form of evidence for its effectiveness. This evidence might be found through published research we read about, research we conduct ourselves, or through experience such as talking to others. In premise reflection we engage in critical scrutiny of the presupposition underlying what we believed was true; this presupposition was left unquestioned in process reflection.

Is it enough to encourage instructors to “be reflective”? Reflection can be reasonably assumed to enhance the practice of teaching only if its outcomes are valid. If these do not constitute valid knowledge, how would reflection be valuable? If our goal is to improve teaching, Mezirow’s model would suggest that it is imperative that we encourage process and premise reflection rather than content reflection on teaching. Process and premise reflection occur through instrumental, communicative and emancipatory forms of learning. One can also argue that these learning processes represent indicators of reflection (Kreber, 2004).

Let’s now consider the method and findings from a study that was based on transformative learning theory.

Method. The nine questions asked during the interview with each of thirty-six academic staff members in the first study are featured in Appendix 1. Each of the nine questions was intended to explore one of the nine different forms of reflection (that is content, process or premise reflection in the domains of instructional, pedagogical or curricular knowledge). It is important to highlight that the questions were not primarily intended to promote reflection of the nine forms described; hence, our goal was not to study “reflection-in-action”. Rather, the intent was to explore whether academic staff members usually engage in actions or behaviours that suggest engagement in any of the nine forms of reflection suggested by the SofT model. Their verbal accounts of what happened as they were engaged in these reflective processes in the past was of particular interest to us and allowed us later to distinguish between declarations of reflection (saying one reflects) and actual indicators of reflection (engaging in particular behaviours from which reflection can be inferred). Essentially, we gathered interviewees’ recollections of their reflections on teaching and only of those nine forms of reflection that were stipulated by the model. Hence, we were testing the applicability of a given model of reflection rather than studying the totality of reflective processes these academics might engage in.

According to this model, instructors, ideally, would be involved in all nine forms of reflection thereby constantly examining and validating their knowledge about teaching. However, what if instructors consider the knowledge resulting from any of these nine forms of reflection not to be relevant for their practice? For example, what if they considered “knowing whether they were conscientious in identifying the goals and purposes of their teaching” (addressed through process reflection within the domain of curricular knowledge) not to be relevant? Or what if they considered “knowing whether the goals and purposes of their teaching are meaningful, whether alternative goals and purposes of teaching are possible, whether these are more meaningful, or less meaningful” (addressed through premise reflection within the domain of curricular knowledge) not to be relevant? Presumably, if they don’t consider the knowledge resulting from certain forms of reflection to be relevant, then they are also unlikely to be motivated to engage in these forms of reflection. Following this line of reasoning, we were asking ourselves whether academic staff’s motivation (or lack thereof) to engage in any of the nine forms of reflection on teaching could be explained somehow. Hatton and Smith (1995) cite a study that researched the obstacles to the implementation of a reflective teacher education program (Valli, 1992). The study showed that program participants’ own conceptualizations of teaching proved to be a considerable barrier to them engaging deeply with strategies used to encourage reflection. In line with this finding, we explored whether an explanation for academics’ motivation to engage in any of the nine forms of reflection described in the model might be found in the specific beliefs they hold about teaching. We also explored whether a further explanation might lie in the number of years they have been teaching.

With these goals in mind, each of the thirty experienced and six inexperienced academic staff members were asked to complete a repertory grid (Kelly, 1955). Simply put, a repertory grid is a tool used in constructivist psychology that has the potential to make a person’s thinking about a given phenomenon explicit (the phenomenon, here, was “reflection on teaching”). As the term suggests, a grid consists of rows and columns. Usually, a series of specific items (referred to as grid elements) that are representative of a particular phenomenon are listed horizontally, and a series of beliefs that the individual holds about these items (referred to as constructs) are listed vertically. The elements are eventually rated on a Likert Scale in relation to each of the constructs. A very clear and readable introduction of how to work with repertory grids can be found in Candy (1990).

In the reported study, a modified repertory grid technique was used. It was modified in a sense that the constructs used were the specific beliefs academics hold about their teaching, and these were identified through the Approaches to Teaching Inventory, $A T I$ (Prosser & Trigwell, 1999). Though ATI items address concrete intentions and strategies rather than conceptions or beliefs about teaching, the items are of course directly related to the latter. For example, the item “I design my teaching in this subject with the assumption that most of the students have very little useful knowledge of the topic to be covered”, suggests a belief that it is the teacher’s responsibility to make the students more knowledgeable about the subject. This belief, in turn, is linked to a conception of teaching that is teacher-focussed and oriented towards transmitting information. Only those ATI items that the respondent scored highly on were used for the grid task.

The grid elements were derived from the nine forms of reflection discussed earlier, namely content, process and premise reflection in the domains of instruction, pedagogy and curriculum. As suggested above, we were interested in exploring whether the beliefs academics hold about teaching and their years of teaching experience might play a role in the extent to which they feel motivated to engage in any of the nine forms of reflection. Following the understanding that a) reflection is a process of knowledge construction, and b) if knowing is not considered relevant reflection is not likely to take place, we used the resulting nine forms of knowing, rather than the nine forms of reflection, as elements in the grid task (see Figure 2). The respondents’ task was to look at each of their beliefs separately (those ATI items they scored highly on) and ask themselves the question: “Considering that I believe this, how relevant do I consider each of the nine forms of knowing to be?”. Expressed more generally, the ATI items served as constructs from which to rate the nine forms of knowing (the grid elements) in terms of their perceived relevance. An example of the grid is provided in Figure 2.

Findings. What follows is just a brief summary of the main findings. For a more comprehensive discussion of this study refer to Kreber (2004). As for the interview data, drastic differences were found in the extent to which academics said they reflect, and in the extent to which they could provide concrete examples of actions they engage in that would demonstrate they do. This is to say that generally, much fewer objective indicators (or evidence) of reflection were provided in the interview than what one might call declaration of reflections (for example, “sure, I reflect on this all the time”). Not surprisingly, all instructors offered evidence of engagement in content reflection. This means that they all were able to articulate what they presently know about instruction, pedagogy and curriculum. Needless to say, of course, some needed considerably more probing than others to make their knowledge explicit and there were vast differences in what participants knew, or more to the point, in what they thought they knew. About two thirds of respondents were able to describe incidents or specific behaviours that suggested they engaged in process reflection in the domains of instructional and pedagogical knowledge. Only twenty percent of respondents were able to recall incidents that gave evidence of process reflection in the domain of curricular knowledge. An intriguing finding was that premise reflection, the questioning of presuppositions, or “critical reflection” (Mezirow, 1991), was not common in any of the three knowledge domains.

It should be noted that there are obvious limitations associated with studying reflection in an interview situation. Boud and Walker (1998), for example, highlight the importance of context in reflection suggesting that contextual features such as unrecognized issues of power can curtail reflection. Clearly, in an interview situation between educational researchers and staff members the latter may easily feel evaluated by the educationists and may also experience a sense of inferiority or vulnerability due to how they perceive the nature of their teaching knowledge (their knowledge being predominantly experience-based whereas the

researchers’ knowledge being predominantly theoretical or research-based, the latter typically being valued more highly by academics). Such perceptions, in turn, are likely to have an effect on the comments they are prepared to volunteer in the interview situation. It is possible that staff members thought that admitting ever having experienced phases of doubts or discomfort regarding their teaching goals, for example, would be interpreted as a sign of poor teaching by the researchers. Anticipating such inferences, they may have decided to mention only those experiences they thought the researchers would associate with good teaching. Though establishing an atmosphere (or space) of trust between interviewer and interviewees was certainly an explicit objective in the study, it is important to keep in mind that the findings reported here are limited by the comments participants chose to make within the context of the interview.

As for the grid data, the findings pointed to the possibility of experience playing a role in reflection. Specifically, experienced staff considered knowing through process reflection within the domain of instructional knowledge as well as knowing through process and premise reflection within the domain of pedagogical knowledge, to be more highly relevant than their inexperienced peers. Interestingly, experienced staff considered knowing through premise reflection to be more highly relevant across all three domains, though only for pedagogical knowledge did this difference reach statistical significance. Following the logic of the argument introduced earlier we can now speculate that since experienced staff consider certain forms of knowing to be more highly relevant than their inexperienced peers, they may also be more motivated to, and hence more likely to, engage in the reflective processes that give rise to these forms of knowing.

The grid data also pointed to the possibility that beliefs about teaching play a role in reflection. Particularly with inexperienced staff, the results indicated that beliefs that represent a student-focused approach to teaching are related to perceived relevance of knowing through reflection within the domain of pedagogical knowledge. One could also say that experience seemed to make less of a difference when staff espoused beliefs about teaching that represented a student-focused approach to teaching than when they represented a teacher-focused approach to teaching.

# The Second Study

In this study, thirty-one science instructors, all full-time academic staff members, participated in an interview that was based on Zimmerman’s (1998) description of the self-regulatory learning cycle. Four participants in this study had less than two years of experience (inexperienced staff) and the others more than ten (experienced staff).

Theoretical framework. Self-regulated learning theory is concerned with specific beliefs and various meta-cognitive and affective processes that influence learning (for example, Hofer, Yu, & Pintrich, 1998; Pintrich, 1995; Schunk & Zimmerman, 1989; Winne, 1997; Zimmerman, 1998). The various reflective processes that define self-regulated learning (SRL) constitute a very different form of reflection than Mezirow’s transformative learning theory, and are based on very different assumptions. Zimmerman’s (1998) self-regulatory learning cycle consists of three phases: forethought, performance and volitional control, and self-reflection. According to Zimmerman (1998), the forethought phase “refers to influential processes and beliefs that precede efforts to learn and set the stage for such learning” (p. 2). The second phase “involves processes that occur during learning efforts and affect concentration and performance” (p. 2). The third phase involves “processes that occur after learning efforts and influence a learner’s reactions to that experience” (p. 2). Characteristic of each phase are certain beliefs and processes that have a direct influence on learning. Skilful self-regulators are described as:

# (in the forethought phase)

setting specific hierarchical learning goals,   
holding a learning rather than a performance goal orientation, having high self-efficacy,   
being intrinsically interested;

(in the performance and volitional control phase)

managing to focus on their performance, using self-instructional techniques, self-monitoring the learning, seeking self-evaluation;

(in the self-reflection phase)

attributing success or failure to the strategies used rather than ability, having positive self-reactions, and showing a high level of adaptivity (Zimmerman, 1998).

The process is described as cyclical as each past experience is seen to have an influence o how future learning events will be approached.

According to this model, how do we know that the outcomes of the reflective process represent valid knowledge about teaching? Let us consider three assumptions underlying this model. First, as long as instructors are able to identify learning goals, are successful at achieving those, and make appropriate attributions regarding this success, they would be assumed to be successful self-regulators. Second, instructors who manage to self-regulate their learning about teaching enhance their knowledge about teaching. Third, as a result of being more knowledgeable about teaching they will teach better. While it might be true that through continuous learning about teaching we will enhance our teaching knowledge, and by extension, our teaching practice, it may not be true that this applies to all kinds of learning. Who decides, one might ask, what is to be learned? Who decides what constitute relevant or important learning goals? Looked at from that perspective, it would appear that the self-regulated learning model, when applied to teaching in higher education, leaves some important questions unanswered.

Is self-regulated learning enough? Surely, I may be a successful self-regulated learner without my goals ever being perceived as challenging by me (see also Brookfield’s, 1986, discussion of the self-directed learner). Perhaps even more importantly, my learning goals may do little by way of enhancing teaching. For example, upon observing some teaching award winning colleagues making use of PowerPoint or using a lot of cartoons to the joy of their students, I may decide to learn about how to incorporate PowerPoint or more humorous cartoons into my own teaching. Both these learning goals are based on certain assumptions I now hold about what makes teaching more effective; however, at no point are these assumptions themselves being questioned. PowerPoint might actually be a rather inappropriate choice for the particular course that I am teaching, and the psychological make up of the majority of my students might be such that they actually would not respond well to my attempts to spice up my lectures with cartoons. It follows that self-regulated learning about teaching may indeed enhance the practice of teaching, but only if the learning goals themselves are relevant. This question of relevance, however, is not addressed in the self-regulated learning model. Hence, we might conclude that self-regulated learning about teaching is “not enough” to enhance teaching practice.

Let us now consider the method and findings from a study that was based on self-regulated learning theory.

Method. Since we were interested in whether participants engaged in self-regulated learning in the three knowledge domains described earlier (that is, instructional, pedagogical and curricular), we developed an interview guide based on the self-regulated learning model and asked the same questions for each domain. See Appendix 2 for the interview guide used in this second study. Clearly, self-report data may not validly reflect self-regulated learning in action (Winne & Perry, 2000); however, we surmised that interview data can uncover important variables that then can be investigated more systematically through follow-up studies. As very little research presently exists on academic staff’s self-regulated learning about teaching, the interview method was considered an appropriate choice.

Findings. What follows is a brief summary of the findings from the second study exploring the extent to which academic staff members engage in self-regulated learning about teaching. For a comprehensive discussion of the methodology and findings refer to (Kreber et al., 2003, in press). In so far as participants’ responses to the interview questions are honest reflections of their engagement in SRL, the study indicates that academics engage in SRL to different degrees. The study identified several variables that might be associated with engagement in SRL. The most interesting results were observed for the domain of instructional knowledge. Individuals more likely to engage in SRL processes within that domain, were also more likely to have had certain educational development experiences. This was not the case for the other two domains, possibly because enhancement of instructional knowledge, rather than pedagogical and curricular knowledge, is typically the target of most educational development activities. Presumably, though our data only yielded indirect evidence of this, experimenting with alternative teaching approaches, reading theoretical articles on teaching and learning, being involved in peer consultation programs, taking workshops on teaching, actively soliciting feedback from students, and attending conferences on teaching and learning, is linked to self-regulated learning within the domain of instructional knowledge.

Though significant differences in the patterns of responses were observed on every process of self-regulation within the domain of pedagogical knowledge, and on almost every process of self-regulation within the domain of curricular knowledge, the study could only shed limited light on the factors that might account for this difference. Reading theoretical articles on teaching was shown to play a role in self-regulated learning within the domain of pedagogical knowledge and participating in peer consultation programs seemed to be related to selfregulated learning about teaching in the domain of curricular knowledge. Interestingly, in this study, experience as an academic staff member did not seem to account for any of the observed differences in reflection. Instead disciplinary affiliation, a variable not considered in the first study, seemed to play a role, with chemists showing greater evidence of engagement in self-regulated learning in the domain of pedagogical knowledge and biologists in the domain of curricular knowledge (it should be noted, however, that the $N$ in both groups was very small).

# Taken Together, What do the Results Mean?

Is this all, one might ask, that these two studies could show? What are we supposed to learn from that? Each of these studies provided no more than a tiny piece of the big puzzle we generally refer to as “reflection on teaching”. Particularly in the area of teaching and learning, such incremental progress can be frustrating at times as, ideally, we would like the results of research to be of use to our practice as educators. When we make an attempt to relate the results from two different studies to each other, we basically try to get a better sense of the larger picture that we hope to uncover over time. Putting two pieces of the puzzle together, exploring whether there is a good fit, is the intent here.

An intriguing finding of the first study was that although most people said they reflect, few could provide convincing accounts that demonstrated engagement in the kinds of reflection that could lead to a transformation of assumption. Both process and premise reflection were identified the least often for the domain of curricular knowledge (knowledge about the purposes and goals of teaching) and premise reflection the least often across all three knowledge domains.

The results from the second study are intriguing in that they suggest that engagement in self-regulated learning is associated with participation in certain educational development activities. In light of recurrent discussions regarding the impact of educational development initiatives (for example, Ferren & Mussell, 1987; Friedman & Stomper, 1983; Gaff & Morstain, 1978; Gibbs & Coffey, 2004; Hoyt & Howard, 1978; Kreber & Brook, 2001), establishing such a connection is indeed an important finding. Basically, however, as was already determined in the discussion earlier, self-regulated learning about teaching is relatively meaningless unless the learning goals we set for ourselves are relevant ones. So how do these results inform or relate to each other, if at all?

In deciding whether or not our learning goals are relevant ones, Mezirow’s transformative learning theory is very helpful. It seems that when we critically question whether it is important to learn about PowerPoint, or to incorporate (planned) humour in the classroom, we need to engage in premise reflection. Learning about teaching, then, may sometimes need to begin with premise reflection in order to be meaningful. Interestingly, premise reflection, however, was the least often identified form of reflection in the first study. Indeed, we may be successful self-regulators in our learning about teaching, but all we ever do when setting our learning goals is to engage in content reflection. This is to say, that we proceed from assumptions we take for granted about what constitutes important learning. Furthermore, considering that across all three knowledge domains reflection within the domain of curricular knowledge was identified the least often, we might be successful self-regulated learners in the domains of instructional and pedagogical knowledge, but we might never engage in the same process for curricular knowledge. That is to say that we may never choose to learn more about the goals and purposes of college teaching. To what extent, however, does it make sense to talk about good teaching if the goals and purposes of that same teaching remain unquestioned? In reference to this point, I recently suggested that the scholarship of teaching movement is perhaps too much concerned with how to teach rather than with what to teach and why (Kreber, 2003).

Experience was shown to play a role in the first study but not in the second. Note that in the first study, these differences were identified only through the grid but not through the interview data. It is possible, therefore, that the interview method is not a sensitive enough research tool to recognize differences in participants’ responses as a function of their experience. Future research exploring experience as a possible variable in the reflective process should not rely exclusively on interviews but perhaps include methods such as observations and logs.

# Suggestions for Future Research and Educational Development

So what implications arise from this discussion for future research and the practice of educational development? One suggestion that follows closely from what has been proposed here is to base a future study of reflection on teaching directly on an educational development initiative. The main purpose of such an initiative would be to help participants identify relevant learning goals for themselves. This would involve promoting premise reflection on what is meaningful knowledge about teaching. As instructors are involved in self-regulating their learning towards the identified goal, the second purpose of the initiative would be to help participants to engage in self-regulated learning. To this end, they would record their experiences in a journal. That is, for each of the various steps in the self-regulated learning cycle they could be asked to record their reactions as truthfully and specifically as possible (for example, how do they self-monitor the learning process?, what attributions do they make regarding the outcomes of their learning?, etc.). For the journal entries to be of greatest relevance for the study, educational developers would be wise to provide some guidelines on how to keep the journal. This might be easily achieved in a workshop setting. Such journal entries would provide much richer data about individuals’ engagement in the various phases of selfregulated learning about teaching than could ever be achieved through interviews alone.

It would then be interesting to explore whether a link can be established between the types of educational development activities that were shown to be associated with engagement in self-regulated learning about teaching in the study reported earlier, and the specific experiences of these academics. This would imply that data be systematically collected from study participants as regards to the specific educational development initiatives they have been involved in. It would then be important to know details such as when they were involved, for how long, how often, what they think were the goals of the activity, what they feel they learned from it, etc. Such data would allow us to determine whether staff members who self-regulate their learning about teaching are more likely to engage in educational development activities, or whether these activities promoted their self-regulatory skills in regards to teaching, or possibly both.

The third purpose of the educational development initiative would be addressed once learning goals have been attained. For example, an instructor might have enhanced his or her knowledge about what motivates the students in his or her course (an aspect of pedagogical knowledge). Now this instructor could be encouraged to engage in process reflection in this knowledge domain by asking “How effective am I in motivating my students” and eventually also in premise reflection by asking “Are there alternatives to what I am doing in order to motivate my students?”. The models of self-regulation and transformative learning, when considered together, provide clear and useful guidelines for the design of both educational development initiatives and research.

If the goal of educational development is seen as instructors taking control over their own learning about teaching, the models hold promise as well. The very idea of self-regulated learning is that individuals develop positive beliefs about themselves as learners, and as a result seek out further learning opportunities independently. However, for this to happen it would seem important that educational development is conceptualized, at least in part, as helping instructors to think about teaching in new ways. The purpose of the educational development initiative then would be two-fold. First it would mean to portray and introduce teaching as a field of inquiry that can be just as intellectually stimulating as the subject or discipline these academics teach. A second purpose would be to instill in academics a sense of self-efficacy as “learners of teaching” by ensuring that they have positive experiences when pursuing their first learning goals in this field.

Cranton (1994) discussed the link between transformative learning and self-directed educational development. As academics engage in reflection on what it is they want to learn, they are involved in setting their own learning goals, an important feature of self-directed learning (Brookfield, 1985; Candy, 1991; Knowles, 1975). As they engage in critical interrogation of what it is they want to learn and why, they are also involved in transformative learning.

This article attempted to answer a simple question: “Is any form of reflection equally meaningful?”. From the previous discussion we can conclude that merely advising instructors to “become reflective practitioners” may not be very meaningful as their interpretation of the notion of reflection might be quite different from that of the educational developer. Most instructors in the first study said they reflected on their teaching. Though their statements were likely very sincere, analyses of the accounts they gave indicated that what most of them really did while “reflecting” was to think within a set of taken-for-granted assumptions. In other words, they engaged in content reflection. If the reason we encourage reflection on teaching is to enhance teaching practice, then it is imperative that assumptions are not just taken for granted but are tested for their validity, as in process reflection, and critically interrogated, as in premise reflection. Content reflection then is not sufficient. If enhancement of teaching, and by extension student learning, is our goal, it would appear that reflection on teaching is not so easy but instead is very hard work! The actual questioning of assumptions is difficult to imagine without at some point either turning to other colleagues or the available literature. Reflection on teaching then is not just, as some skeptics might think, a “solitary armchair activity” whereby we merely recall and think through recent teaching experiences, though it surely will require such “quiet time” as well. Reflection on teaching begins with identifying the assumptions and beliefs we take for granted, but it must not stop there. It needs to go further and involve engaging in particular learning processes (instrumental, communicative and emancipatory) that will either lead to a validation or rejection of our assumptions. Examples of what these learning processes might look like were provided in this article. Kreber and Cranton (2000) also provided several examples and introduced them as “indicators of reflection”. While Kreber and Cranton derived these conceptually, a recent study identified such indicators empirically (Kreber, 2004). When instructors are encouraged to engage in self-regulated learning about teaching, it was argued, the same processes need to be considered for their learning to be meaningful.

# Appendix 1

Interview guide derived from the scholarship of teaching model (Kreber & Cranton, 2000). The study explored the question “Do science instructors engage in content, process and premise reflection in the domains of instructional, pedagogical and curricular knowledge?”

Question One (Reflection on Content within the Domain of Instructional Knowledge)

● As you go about teaching your course this term, did you give any thought to how to set up this course, what instructional strategies or approaches to use? Of the various things you mentioned, what do you consider to be the most important strategy or approach you use? I will ask you to elaborate on that one a bit.

Question Two (Reflection on Process within the Domain of Instructional Knowledge)

What led you to make use of this particular method or approach?   
● How did you learn that this would be effective? Can you think of something specific you do or did that helped you learn that that this is a good method or approach to make use of?

Question Three (Reflection on Premise within the Domain of Instructional Knowledge)

If someone said to you I don’t think it makes a difference whether or not you use (the method or approach the instructor talked about)? What would be your reaction?   
Have you ever explored or questioned whether or not this approach makes a difference in “how well you feel your courses $\mathbf { g o } ^ { \mathsf { , , 1 } } \sharp$ Have you ever explored alternatives? Can you think of anything in particular that you did when you questioned if making use of makes a difference?

Question Four (Reflection on Content within the Domain of Pedagogical Knowledge)

What do you know about how students learn?

Question Five (Reflection on Process within the Domain of Pedagogical Knowledge)

Considering the undergraduate science course you are presently teaching, how do you know that you are successful with helping your students learn?   
Can you think of anything you do in order to find out whether the way you facilitate the learning of your students is effective?

Question Six (Reflection on Premise within the Domain of Pedagogical Knowledge)

Have you ever questioned whether the way you attempt to facilitate the learning of your students makes a difference in how well they learn?

● Have you ever explored alternatives? Can you think of anything in particular that you did when you questioned whether it makes a difference that you facilitate the learning of your students in this way?

Question Seven (Reflection on Content within the Domain of Curricular Knowledge)

What is/are the main goal(s) and purpose(s) of your teaching as you are teaching this course?

Question Eight (Reflection on Process within the Domain of Curricular Knowledge)

Can you think of something specific you do or did that helped you identify that this (these) should be the goal(s) or purpose(s)?   
● How have the goals and purposes come about; have they changed or evolved over time? Can you think of anything specific you did or do in order to find out whether these goals or purposes needed to change?

Question Nine (Reflection on Premise within the Domain of Curricular Knowledge)

Have you ever critically reflected on whether the goals, purposes and rationale that you identified for your course make a difference to student learning? Have you ever experimented with alternative goals? Can you think of anything in particular that you did when you questioned whether the goals and purposes you selected make a difference to student learning?

As one goal was to identify whether individuals engaged in reflection on experience-based knowledge or on research-based knowledge, or both, we added the following questions for both process and premise reflection in each of the three knowledge domains:

● The example you have just given is a very good one. We would classify this as experiencebased knowledge (or research-based knowledge depending on what it was that the person said) Would you think your learning (in the particular area that was described) is also informed by some theoretical, formal, research-based, or public/published knowledge about teaching (or your own teaching experience depending on what the person said earlier). If so, how?

We also developed for each question additional probes to be used if needed.

# Appendix 2

Interview guide based on Zimmerman’s self-regulatory learning cycle. The study explored the question “Do instructors engage in self-regulated learning in the domains of instructional, pedagogical, and curricular knowledge?”

General question:

Can you think of the last time you made any changes to your teaching and tell me a little more about that? What did you decide to change and why (what prompted the change)? We then would like to discuss this a little further.

Specific questions:

1. When thinking about the specific science course you were teaching last term…   
2. Did you have some ideas about changing how you would teach the course this term? Probe if answer is “no”: How about compared with the last time you taught this course? How about after you received your course/teaching evaluation? Probe if answer is “no”: How about compared with other courses you have taught?   
3. Could you elaborate on what it was that you wanted to change? State: We would consider this idea as a learning goal you had set for yourself. Would you agree?   
4. In hindsight, what motivated you to pursue this goal?   
5. Goals can sometimes be very difficult to attain. In retrospect, to what extent did you trust your ability to attain the goal that you had set for yourself? Put differently, to what extent did you trust your ability to successfully address the questions or challenges that were posed by your goals?   
6. How would you describe your commitment to this goal? How much priority did it have? Was it something you lost sight of again as the term went on or was it something that you came back to regularly?   
7. Let’s explore a little further what you did when you worked towards this goal. Did you, for example, try to imagine how another teacher would go about this? Did you imagine yourself in the classroom before trying it out? Did you read related material, talk to a colleague, verbalize things to yourself, for example, keeping a journal, talking to yourself, etc. Please be as specific as possible. Perhaps none of these apply and you used another self-instructional learning strategy?   
8. Would you think you collected any feedback on the process you undertook to learn about this idea [learning goal] (did you self-monitor the learning process)? How so? Probe: Use the book analogy if necessary—that is, read a book, close it, perhaps right down the salient points, then reopen the book to confirm accuracy.   
9. Did you personally evaluate the success of your attempt to attain your learning goal? How so?   
10. Would you think you attained the learning goals you had set for yourself?   
11. How would you explain the level of your success with your learning? What would you attribute the level of your success to? (Probe: “the learning strategies used, how much you practiced, your ability…”.) Please be specific.   
12. How did you react to your level of success with your learning? (Probe: Did you experience enjoyment or frustration…)   
13. Has this learning experience led to any changes in how you would approach any further attempts to make changes to your teaching?

The same thirteen questions were also asked for the domains of pedagogical and curricular knowledge.
