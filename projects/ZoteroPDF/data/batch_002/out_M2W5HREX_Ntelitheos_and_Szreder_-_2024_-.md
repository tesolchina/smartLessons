# ABSTRACT

# ARTICLE HISTORY

We provide an account of the developmental trajectory of Emirati Arabic negation particles. We treat the non-verbal predicate negator (NVPN) mub as a negative copula, in contrast to the verbal predicate negator (VPN) maa, which encodes sentential negation in verbal and existential contexts. The analysis is supported by evidence from a longitudinal corpus of six Emirati children. Given the high frequency of occurrence of maa in the ambient language, we show that an input-frequency account predicts maa-mub substitutions in early stages of acquisition. However, confirming previous findings by Becker we show that when mub emerges in later stages, its distribution exhibits an asymmetry: mub is used frequently with individuallevel nominal/adjectival predicates but it almost never appears with stage level adjectival/prepositional/ adverbial predicates, mirroring the distribution of copular elements in child English (and other languages).

# 1. Introduction

This paper discusses the properties of verbal and non-verbal predicate negation in Emirati Arabic and provides an analysis of the two negators from a language acquisition point of view based on data from a longitudinal study of the language.

In Emirati Arabic, negation is expressed with two different particles: maa for verbal predicate negation (VPN) (1) and mub for non-verbal predicate negation (NVPN)1 (2):

(1) maa ʃərab-t əl-maaj. not drink.PERF-1SG the-water ‘I did not drink the water.’   
(2) ʔaħmad mub gəwi Ahmed not strong ‘Ahmed is not strong.’

Following standard grammatical analyses of this type of particles in Arabic (see for example Ryding’s (2005) treatment of the Modern Standard Arabic particle ‘laysa’ as ‘not to be’), we assume that mub is a negative copula. In such an analysis, mub acts as a copular particle2 with negative semantics. VPN maa is a lot more frequent than mub in the adult language and appears in several diverse environments including existential sentences and cases of secondary predication (see discussion in the second section for details).

The higher frequency of maa in the input as well as the proposed categorial status of mub as a negative copula make certain predictions about the development of negation in Emirati child language. Specifically, since maa is a lot more frequent than mub in the adult language (and childdirected speech), it is predicted to emerge earlier in language development and possibly substitute for mub in NVPN contexts. A number of morphosyntactic structures in early language development follow developmental trajectories that are predictable from the statistical distribution of the target structures in the child’s input, the ambient language and child-directed speech (for a literature review see Ambridge et al. 2015). Input-frequency effects have been widely studied and demonstrated to be relevant to the acquisition of a wide range of items and structures cross-linguistically, and recently in morphological development in Emirati Arabic (Szreder et al. 2022). As Ambridge et al. (2015) point out, sensitivity to input frequency cannot be the only driving force behind language acquisition but there can be no account of language development without incorporating at least some components based on statistical patterns in the child’s input. As uncontroversial as these effects are, they are by no means simple, and often interact with phonological and syntactic complexity, as well as communicative function. This leads to a second prediction about possible patterns of NVPN development in child Emirati Arabic: if NVPN mub is a negative copula, then it is expected to at least partially match the developmental trajectory of copular elements in other languages, for example, English.

Based on data from child Emirati Arabic, we provide evidence supporting both predictions. We show that there are clear input-frequency effects in the developmental trajectory of the two particles in Emirati Arabic. VPN maa is acquired earlier and substitutes for mub in NVPN contexts. In addition, the distribution of maa-mub substitution errors follows an asymmetric pattern in individual-level and stage-level predicate contexts, similar to that of copular verbs in languages like English (Wexler 2000; Becker 2000a, 2000b). We take this as evidence supporting the categorial status of mub as a negative copula. All our analyses are based on quantitate data from a longitudinal corpus of child Emirati Arabic. However, because of the small number of children in the corpus as well as the limited number of target tokens, statistical analyses would not provide reliable results and were therefore not performed. Thus, further work will be needed in this domain when a larger corpus becomes available or through experimental work.

The paper is organized as follows: the second section provides the theoretical, typological, and historical motivations for treating mub as a negative copula. The third section provides a discussion of the development of copular elements in child language, based mainly on the analysis of English child language patterns in Becker (2000a, 2000b). The fourth section presents a study of the acquisition of NVPN patterns in child Emirati Arabic exhibiting the role of input-frequency effects in the developmental patterns observed and showing that the observed distribution of mub follows similar patterns with the distribution of copular BE in child English. The fifth section provides further discussion of the observed child data and shows that while an input-based approach accounts for the bulk of the observed data, an additional account of morphosyntactic complexity needs to be implemented to fully explain the observed patterns. Finally, the sixth section presents our concluding remarks.

# 2. NVPN mub as negative copula

In Emirati Arabic, the proclitic maa marks negation in verbal contexts irrespective of the tense specification3 of the verbs involved:

(3) Fatima maa gəfla-t əl-baab. Fatima not lock-3SG.F the-door. ‘Fatima did not lock the door.’

(4) Ahmed maa ba-eetˤarʃ haðii əl-rəsalh li-moodjər-ah. Ahmed not will-send this the-letter for-boss-3SG.M.POSS. ‘Ahmed will not send this letter to his boss.’

In addition, the particle maa is used in existential contexts:

(5) Maa fii4 koofee fii koob-i not there_is coffee in cup-1SG.POSS. ‘There is no coffee in my cup.’   
(6) Fatima maa ʕənd-ha malaabs ɣaaləjh. Fatima not with-3SG.F.POSS clothes expensive. ‘Fatima does not have any expensive clothes.’

The negative marker mub is used with non-verbal predicates such as nouns, adjectives (including comparative and superlative forms), prepositions, and participles:

(7) Mub əl-joom banrooħ əl-baħar not the-day go the-sea ‘(It is) not the day to go to the beach.’   
(8) iɣa mub ʤahez, momken t-agʕad fii l-bjet. if not ready, maybe 2SG-sit in the-home. ‘If (you are) not ready, maybe stay at home.’   
(9) Mub b-əl-galəm ktəb-t-ah, b-əl-kambjawtr not with-the-pen write-3SG.F-3SG with-the-computer. ‘(It is) not with the pen that she wrote it but with the computer.’   
(10) mub b-əl-məgasˤ t-gəsˤsˤ-in-ah haa. not with-the-scissors 2SG.F-cut.IMPERF-2SG.F-3SG this ‘You don’t cut this with the scissors.’   
(11) haaj mubʔ a-ħla ʕan-ha. this.F not more-beautiful than-3SG.F ‘She is not more beautiful than her’   
(12) mub ʔa-kbar ʃaj not most-big thing ‘not the biggest thing.’

Finally, anaphoric negation is expressed with the particle laa:

(13) b-truħ-een əl- ʤtimaʕ? (Speaker A) FUT-go-2SG the-meeting? ‘Are you going to the meeting?’ laa, laazəm ʔxlusˤ məʃruʕ-i əl-ləjlh. (Speaker B) no, must finish project-1SG.POSS the-night. ‘No, I must finish my project tonight.’

The particle laa is also used in negative imperatives:

(14) Laa, tə-sakər əl-dəriʃah ħar. not you-close the-window hot ‘Don’t close the window, it’s hot.’   
(15) Laa tə-gətˤəʕ əl-ward not you-cut the-flowers ‘Don’t cut the flowers!’

In Emirati Arabic (non-negative) non-verbal predicate contexts in present tense there is no overt copula:

(16) ʔaħmad ləɣawi. Ahmed linguist ‘Ahmed is a linguist.’ (17) ʔaħmad mub ləɣawi. Ahmed not linguist ‘Ahmed is not a linguist.’

In past and future contexts, a copular element kaan is used obligatorily:

(18) ʔaħmad kaan ləɣawi. Ahmed be.PERF-3SG.M linguist ‘Ahmed was a linguist.’   
(19) ʔaħmad ba-j-kuun ləɣawi. Ahmed will-3SG.M-be.IMPERF linguist ‘Ahmed will be a linguist.’

In negative sentences, when the copular element is present, VPN negation maa is used:

(20) ʔaħmad maa kaan ləɣawi. Ahmed not be.PERF.3SG.M linguist ‘Ahmed was a linguist.’   
(21) ʔaħmad maa ba-j-kuun ləɣawi. Ahmed not will-3SG.M-be.IMPERF linguist ‘Ahmed will be a linguist.’

Thus, there is a complementary distribution between maa+kaan and mub in different contexts:

(22) maa COPULA NON-VERBAL PREDICATE (past/future) (23) mub NON-VERBAL PREDICATE (present)

It thus seems that mub occupies a position which incorporates both the semantics of negation as well as the linking role of a copular element between a subject and its non-verbal predicate.

Negative copulas are in many cases grammaticalized compositions of VPN negators with a copular element (a light verb, a focus/topic marker, a pronominal form, or a grammaticalized verb of perception, see Eriksen 2011:294). Some examples include the negative copular forms değil ‘not be’ in Turkish (Lewis 1967); laysa in Modern Standard Arabic (Ryding 2005); rpkomha ‘3SG-be /do-not’ in Kwamera (Lindstrom & Lynch 1994); anida ‘not be’ (c.f. ida ‘to be’) in Korean (Martin 1992), alla ‘not be’ in Malaylam (Asher & Kumari 1997); among many others. The following example (from Ryding 2005) illustrates the negative copula use of the particle laysa in Modern Standard Arabic:

(24) lays-a l-usta:ðu muʔarrixan not.be the-professor historian ‘The professor is not a historian’

Typological studies of negation patterns show that NVPN is often expressed with particles distinct from the ones used in VPN, especially in languages which lack a copula. Croft (1991) lists three types of (existential) predicate negation that form a ‘cycle’: Type A, where the negation of the existential predicate is identical to that of verbal predicates; Type B, with a special negative existential predicate, distinct from the verbal negator; and Type C where there is still a special negative existential predicate, but which is formally identical to the verbal negator. The transitions follow the cycle as follows:

$\mathbf A > \mathbf B$ : While in a Type A language there is no special negative existential predicate, in the transition one is formed as separate from regular negative existential form.   
$\mathrm { ~ B ~ } > \mathrm { ~ C ~ }$ : The grammaticalized negative existential predicate begins to be used for ordinary verbal negation but only in some contexts.   
$\mathrm { C } > \mathrm { A }$ : The negative existential predicate which now acts also as a verbal negator is being reanalysed as a general negative marker accompanying an existential verb in negative existential constructions.

Synchronic variation seems to follow this pattern with attested variations between Type A-Type B, Type B-Type C, and Type C-Type A. Croft (1991) argues that these synchronically variable types imply grammaticalization processes that follow the principles of a directionality of change expressed as $\mathbf A > \mathbf B$ , $\mathrm { B } > \mathrm { C } ,$ and $\mathrm { { C } } > \mathrm { { A } }$ . For Emirati Arabic, this would indicate a grammaticalization stage of an $\mathbf A > \mathbf B$ direction, where an earlier stage in which the negation of non-verbal predicates was expressed by the verbal predicate negator maa (Type A) has evolved to a stage where a special negator (mub) marks non-verbal predicates (Type B).

Veselinova (2006, 2013), in a small typological study of verbal, non-verbal, and existential negators finds that the data available in her study seem to point to a correlation between absence of a copular element in NVPN contexts and a NVPN negator that differs from the VPN negator. Eriksen (2011) proposes an explanation for this tendency in terms of a universal avoidance of non-verbal predicates under the direct scope of negation, which he terms ‘Direct Negation Avoidance’ (DNA). In this account, languages that use VPN negators for non-verbal predicates need a ‘mediator’, which is frequently an auxiliary verb or a copula of some type, which mediates between VPN negation and the non-verbal predicate. Eriksen (2011) proposes that in cases where a DNA mediator is only found in negative clauses, it might easily merge with the VPN negator and be grammaticalized into a NVPN negator. If this is correct, then copulas are expected to be in complementary distribution with NVPN negators, as a copula would make the latter superfluous (Eriksen 2011:293).

Following this line of analysis, based on typological and grammaticalization studies, we assume that mub is derived from a historical process of grammaticalization, based on VPN negation maa and some copular element. Holes (2004:243) assumes that all different instantiations of non-verbal predicate negators in different Arabic dialects, including muʃ/miʃ (Egypt, Libya, parts of Yemen, and Morocco), mu (Levant generally), mu/mi/mub/muhub/hub (Gulf Arabic varieties), and maʃi (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and parts of Yemen) are etymologically cognates. More particularly, he proposes that they are all reduced composite forms, which are derived by various combinations of elements from a closed set of building blocks which include: the VPN negator ma(a) ‘not’; a 3rd person singular pronominal element huu/hii which acts as a copula; a semantically null prepositional element bi; and the generic nominal head ʃi ‘thing’.5

In Arabic there is variation as to whether the VPN negator can be used in negating present tense non-verbal predicate constructions. Thus, in Sudanese Arabic this is allowed:

(25) ʔaħmad huu maa gawi SUDANESE ARABIC Ahmed 3SG.M.is not strong ‘Ahmed is not strong.’

However, in Emirati Arabic, this is not possible. The only way to allow for VPN to appear with a nonverbal predicate copular structure is by prefixing the functional morpheme $^ { b }$ - to the predicate, and with the reverse word order (a pattern marginally acceptable in Emirati Arabic but which is more widespread in dialects of Saudi Arabia):

(26) ʔaħmad maa huu b-gəwi Ahmed not 3SG.M.is strong ‘Ahmed is not a strong person. (Ahmed is not strong.)’ (27) ʔaħmad mub gəwi Ahmed not strong ‘Ahmed is not strong.’

The structure in (26), which is marginally grammatical in Emirati Arabic, gives us linearly the sequence maa-huu- $^ { b }$ which is claimed to consist of the different elements that have grammaticalized into the NVPN mub in Emirati Arabic (as in (27)).6

Finally, Hoyt (2010) also refers to the variants miʃ, mub, mu as negative copulas, near-synonyms of the actual so-called “pronouns of negation,” which are morphological combinations of the negator maa and one of the pronouns, for example, maahu for 3rd person masculine singular, with the meaning ‘he is not’, expressing usually additional emphasis or polarity contrast (Hoyt 2010:100). There is, therefore, considerable evidence that mub may be historically derived by a maa-huu- $^ { b }$ sequence of elements, resulting in a synchronic interpretation of the particle as a negative copular element.

# 3. The development of copula in child language

We will be discussing two main issues related to the acquisition of negation in Emirati Arabic and, thus, we need to explore how they are supported by crosslinguistic analyses of similar patterns in other child languages. A first important issue has to do with the effects input-frequency has on the development of copular particles and negation cross linguistically and the second issue has to do with the possible existence of underlying biases, which may affect children’s language use in the production of copular structures. The idea is that children across different languages follow very similar developmental paths with respect to the expression of different types of predicates and these similarities are evident irrespectively of whether the language has overt copular particles or not.

With respect to issues related to effects of input-frequency on acquisition in general, Ambridge et al. (2015) point out that sensitivity to input frequency cannot be the only driving force behind language acquisition and that very often input-frequency factors interact with other developmental factors in driving development.

In studies of negation, an example of such an interaction between frequency and other factors can be found in Cameron-Faulkner et al. (2007), who provide data from English child language exhibiting early non-adult-like use of negator no in environments where the predicate negator not is expected in English (e.g., ‘no move’). Such use is never attested in the ambient language, which in general very rarely exhibits multiword expressions containing the negator no. Despite this fact, the authors argue that these early errors are frequency-driven if one considers frequencies of both the surface form occurrence and the communicative functions. In the first stages of acquisition, children seem to just use the most frequent overall negator in the input $( n o )$ , which is additionally functionally generic and salient. They combine this negator directly with verbs, a sequence that is not attested in adult language. In later stages, they start using the less frequent negator not with verbs, (e.g., ‘not going there’). Again, this is not very frequent in adult language where auxiliary-negation contractions (won’t, can’t, and so on) dominate. However, multiword expressions with not are more frequent in the input than expressions with no, and it is this kind of frequency they claim determines child production. In the final stages of negation acquisition, children use auxiliaries, but this shift is dependent on the function of the utterances (e.g., prohibitions like ‘don’t sit down there’ or inability, e.g. ‘I can’t talk’) and is tied to the frequency of particular contracted forms (e.g., don’t, can’t) to express particular functions in the input.

Thus, input-frequency is an important factor in the developmental process, but certain other factors seem to interact with frequency to produce the patterns observed in child language. For our discussion, one significant such factor is the status of the predicate involved in the target negative constituent, irrespectively of whether the target language has overt copular elements or not.

As we have seen in example (16), Emirati Arabic (on a par with other Arabic dialects) allows for non-verbal predication to appear without a copular verb in present tense. This seems to also be the case in other languages, for example Russian (Chvany 1975), where in non-existential predication cases, the copula verb byt is not expressed in the present tense:

(28) On student. he student ‘He is a student.’   
(29) On byl student/studentom. he was student ‘He was a student.’

English, conversely, unlike Emirati Arabic and Russian, does not allow copulaless predication7

(30) Ahmed is a linguist.   
(31) \*Ahmed a linguist.

Despite this fact, early work on language acquisition has shown that children in early stages of development produce predication structures like (31), as reported in Bloom (1970), Brown (1973), Radford (1990), Becker (2000a, 2000b), examples from Radford (1990:156-157):

(32) Geraint naughty. (Bethan, $2 0 ^ { 8 } )$ ) (33) Hand cold. Fire hot. (Elen, 20) (34) It hot. (Angharad, 22) (35) Sausage bit hot. (Jem, 23) (36) Claire full. (Claire, 24) (37) Mouse in window. It in bag. (Hayley, 20) (38) Daddy away. Mummy away. (Jem, 21) (39) Truck outside. (Allison, 22) (40) Light up there. (Andrew, 23) (41) Dolly on horsey. (Daniel, 23)

Based on these patterns, early approaches to copula omission assumed that the copula is often dropped due to being a functional element without a real lexical/semantic contribution (e.g., Brown 1973). However, later formal models emphasised the fact that children develop syntactic structure in an incremental fashion, starting from a core lexical domain containing the predicate and its arguments, and adding progressively more functional layers as they are exposed to the relevant input, following a maturational process, as implemented for example in Radford’s (1990, 1995) “small clause” hypothesis or Rizzi’s (1994) “truncation model”. In both accounts, in non-verbal predication of the type in example (32), ‘Geraint naughty’ would be derived from a small clause where the subject ‘Geraint’ merges in the specifier position of the predicate adjective ‘naughty’. In adult language an additional higher functional layer would introduce Tense/ Agreement features, expressed by the semantically null copular verb BE in the appropriate form: ‘Geraint is happy.’ However, child English lacks these higher functional layers in early stages and thus children produce copulaless sentences of the type in (32)-(41).

Becker (2000a, 2000b), examines the acquisition of copula in English, based on an extensive longitudinal study of five children (ages 2;0-3;4: Adam, Eve, Naomi, Nina, Peter), which is available within the CHILDES database (MacWhinney & Snow 1990). She finds the same pattern of copula omission with copulaless sentences alternating with target sentences, in many different environments:

(42) You’re so dirty (Naomi 2;0) (43) me tired (Naomi 2;0) (44) Daddy’s at school (Peter 2;2) (45) I in the kitchen (Nina 2;1) (46) he’s a dog (Nina 2;0) (47) I not honey. (Adam 2;11)

However, this pattern of copula omission does not seem to apply across the board; certain environments appear to resist omission:

(48) He’s a dog. (49) @ He a dog9

Any developmental account of these patterns needs to address both the omission of copula in the cases of (32)-(41) and the fact that certain environments resist such omission. Becker (2000a, 2000b, 2004) assumes a structural distinction between the copulaless utterances of examples (32)-(41) and the obligatory presence of copula in the utterance in (48). The predicate ‘a dog’ in the obligatory copula sentence of (48) denotes a permanent property attributed to the pronominal subject ‘he’, while in the copulaless structures in (32)- (41) the predicates ‘tired’ and ‘at school’ attribute temporal properties/states to their respective subjects. This permanent versus temporary distinction of predicates is formally modelled on the individual-level (IL) versus stage-level (SL) distinction respectively, in Carlson (1977, 1980), Schmitt (1992) and Kratzer (1988, 1995). In some of these accounts the distinction is syntactic in nature, i.e., in Kratzer (1995) it depends on the height of merger for the subject of the predicate: inside the predicate domain for SL predicates or in a higher functional projection in IL predicates; in other accounts (e.g., Schmitt 1992, 1996) it is a semantic distinction, where SL predicates are aspectually ‘marked’ as stative, while IL predicates are not specified and therefore can appear in numerous contexts.10

Returning to copula omission in child contexts, an interesting observation (see, for example, Becker 2000a, 2000b, 2004) is that while the copula is omitted with both nominal (IL) and locative (SL) predicates, its rate of omission differs vastly in these two constructions. The average rates of an overt copula in nominal and locative predicative constructions, for five children, are given in Table 1:

Table 1. Average rate of overt be in children’s nominal and locative predicative constructions.   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td colspan="2">Predicate nominal</td><td colspan="2">Predicate locativea</td></tr><tr><td>Child Nina</td><td>74.1%</td><td>(143)</td><td>14.0%</td><td>(115)</td></tr><tr><td>Peter</td><td>81.2%</td><td>(401)</td><td>26.7%</td><td>(90)</td></tr><tr><td> Naomi</td><td>89.7%</td><td>(102)</td><td>38.1%</td><td>(31)</td></tr><tr><td>Adam</td><td>44.4%</td><td>(303)</td><td>4.9%</td><td>(26)</td></tr><tr><td>Eve</td><td>39.8%</td><td>(206)</td><td>54.8%</td><td>(33)</td></tr><tr><td>Avg. % overt be</td><td colspan="2">65.8%</td><td colspan="2">27.7%</td></tr></table></body></html>

a This category includes PP locatives, e.g., in the kitchen, as well as adverbial locative phrases such as there (as in, My toy is (over) there).

The data clearly show that the copula is largely overt in cases of nominal predication, but it is mostly omitted in locative predicate structures (except for Eve’s data, see Becker 2000a:90-91). The reason for the difference in copula omission between the two structures could be related to the semantico-syntactic differences between the two types of predicates: the stative aspectual character of SL predicates results in copulaless structures, while the more generic, ‘unmarked’ character of IL predicates requires the presence of an overt copula (see Becker 2000a for the mechanics of the syntactic derivations on these two patterns). In simple terms, Becker (2000a) assumes that SL predicates are non-finite counterparts of tensed sentences with IL predicates, in the same way that Optional/Root Infinitive structures are the non-finite counterpart of tensed verbs. Given that IL predicates are finite, the obligatory presence of the copula is expected. SL predicates on the other hand, are assumed to have a reduced structure (c.f. Radford’s (1990, 1995) “small clause” hypothesis or Rizzi’s (1994) “truncation model”) and thus the projection where the copula would have been realized is not available (see Becker (2000a) for a slightly different formal model). The projection where finiteness is expressed, and which hosts the copular element, may not necessarily be completely unavailable but just ‘underspecified’ in the sense of Hyams (1996). This would explain why the copula can sometimes appear with SL predicates, while at the same time explaining its frequent omission in these contexts.

Further work has shown similar facts to hold in the acquisition of other languages. Czinglar et al. (2006), based on data from two longitudinal child language corpora, show that in German child language the preferred context for the expression of nominal (IL) predicates includes a copula while locative (SL) predicates are most often expressed with the copula omitted. In addition, they show that copulaless contexts usually appear with lexical subjects, while nominal predicates show a preference for pronominal subjects.

In Spanish and Portuguese, IL and SL predicates are expressed with different copulas. Specifically, the copular ser is mainly used with IL predicates ascribing more permanent properties to their subjects, while the copula estar is inserted in SL predicate contexts which ascribe temporary and/or accidental properties to their subjects (Roldán 1974; Schmitt 1992, 1996; Maienborn 2000; examples from Schmitt 1996:358):

(50) Bombeiros são/\*estão altruístas. IL (ser) Firemen are altruistic.   
(51) Bombeiros \*são/estão disponíveis. SL (estar) Firemen are available.   
(52) # Um homem é altruísta. IL (ser) A man is altruistic.   
(53) Um homem está disponível. SL (estar) A man is available.

Aspectual analyses of the distribution of the two copulas (see, for example, Camacho 2012, Schmitt & Miller 2007) assume, on a par with Becker’s (2000a, 2000b) work, that the distinction between ser and estar is based on differences in morphosyntactic properties, including their feature specification (Camacho 2012) or different structure (as in Becker’s analysis, see Gallego & Uriagereka 2009). In most of these approaches, estar contains aspectual information that, unlike ser, links the interpretation to some external context imposing a stative interpretation of an evaluative adjective (Arche et al. 2017). In developmental studies, corpus-based research has indicated that young Spanish-speaking children combine adjectives with the two copulas based on the semantics and morphology of the adjectives and use estar with adjective to refer to contrasts or to temporary changes in properties (see, for example, Espinosa-Ochoa 2019). In experimental work, Requena (2021) using a Picture Selection Task that included pictures of characters in either a permanent state or a temporary (changed) state, found that children at age four or older interpreted estar as more temporally bounded than ser, and were more restrictive in their interpretation of estar but less restrictive in their interpretation of ser. Conversely, children below the age of four did not show evidence that they distinguish the two copulas with either known or novel adjectives indicating that the required discourse/pragmatic information to distinguish between Spanish copulas ser and estar with adjectives are not fully mastered at this age. In terms of commission errors, Reyes (2017) showed that both bilingual (Spanish English) and monolingual Spanish speaking children exhibit a general overextension of IL copula estar with temporary states denoted by adjectives and event locatives.

Finally, there are cases of languages where there seems to be no copula omission, even in early stages of acquisition, and thus no distinction between IL and SL predicate structure patterns in child language. Czinglar et al. (2006) report data from a Croatian-speaking child, showing that even at the early two-word stage the child produces consistently the copula in non-verbal predicate structures and in fact corrects herself when she accidentally produces a copulaless sentence. Czinglar et al. (2006) attribute the lack of copula omission in Croatian child language to the fact that the language does not have a Root Infinitive stage, that is, finite verbal forms emerge very early and are used consistently in a target-like fashion. This means that the tense projection is activated early in Croatian and thus it has to be expressed with an overt copula in non-verbal predicate contexts.

In the following section, we will investigate the development of NVPN in Emirati Arabic, based on the assumption that the target NVPN negator is in fact a negative copula, exhibiting a similar IL-SL distributional developmental pattern as the one shown to hold for copula acquisition in English, Spanish, and German.

# 4. The development of non-verbal predicate negation in Emirati Arabic

We test the development of NVPN in Emirati Arabic in the light of the discussion of copula development in the previous section and taking into account certain statistical facts about the distribution of the two types of copulas in the ambient language.

Given our treatment of VPN maa as a negative particle while assuming that NVPN mub is a negative copula, we predict that the development of the latter in child Emirati Arabic will follow a similar pattern to the development of copulas in languages like English, as discussed in the second section. Thus, while maa is predicted to substitute for mub in NVPN environments, due to its higher frequency in child directed speech (CDS), we expect different distributional patterns in stage-level versus individual-level predicate contexts. If the data confirms this prediction, it will provide further evidence of the hypothesised diachronic development of mub.

We base our description of the relevant developmental patterns on a two-year longitudinal corpus of six Emirati children11 (the EMALAC Corpus, Ntelitheos & Idrissi 2017). The EMALAC corpus is drawn from 41 half-hour recordings of six Emirati children, three girls and three boys, and an Emirati woman marked as ‘investigator’, taken roughly every two weeks, for a period of two years. The children come from a middle-class socio-economic background with high school and university educated parents employed in government positions or staying at home. The language in their home environment is Emirati Arabic, while they are also minimally exposed to a pidgin variety of Arabic and English, spoken by domestic helpers working in the house. The investigator visited the children’s house and recorded interactions between the children themselves as well as between the children and the investigator. The length of each recording was around 30 minutes and took place at two-week intervals. After completion of the recording phase two Emirati Arabic native speaker assistants transcribed the recorded sessions, using IPA transcription. Transcription was entered directly into a customized database platform using CLAN software, which is freely available in the CHILDES12 language acquisition website. The transcription and coding format followed a simplified version of Codes for the Human Analysis of Transcripts (CHAT). A simplified MinMOR grammar was created for the dialect for annotation purposes and the transcripts were annotated semiautomatically and checked manually by the assistants for accuracy. The annotation included part-ofspeech taggers, morphological annotation, and English gloss for each word in the transcript.

Both the children and the investigator in the database are from the same family (first- and seconddegree relations). The investigator, being a close relative (fraternal aunt), spent considerable time with the children prior to the corpus recordings. Thus, given the absence of a dedicated adult CDS corpus, the investigator’s speech in EMALAC can provide a reliable approximation of the properties of the input.

Most of the children were available for most of the recordings, while two children participated in only around half of the available 43 sessions. Table 2, provides some basic statistic information of the database, including child names and age-ranges with number of words and number of utterances per child, as well as the total of adult, child-directed utterances. The EMALAC corpus was annotated for all cases of negation, including the anaphoric negator laa, as well as VPN negator maa and NVPN negator mub. In addition, all commission errors (including replacements of mub by maa) were coded. Finally, each instance of non-verbal predicate context was coded as nominal, adjectival, or locative (including both prepositional phrases and adverbials).

A first look at the data reveals that children use negators at frequencies that match CDS frequencies in the cases of both anaphoric and VPN negation. Table 3 presents all different types of negation in the CDS and child data, including numbers of tokens as well as percentage of occurrence for each negator (out of the total of negative contexts).

As visible from Table 3, the frequency of use of all three negators by children reflects their frequency in CDS. The negator mub is the least frequent negator, appearing in only $2 . 4 7 \%$ of negative contexts.

CDS, child directed speech.

Investigating the negative contexts in the child data we find that children frequently substitute maa for mub in non-verbal predicate contexts, confirming our prediction. Some examples of these errors are provided below:

(54) . . . wbaba salem maa helu sejjatah (Hamad, 30.01) . . . and-father Salem not beautiful car-3SG.M . . . and my father Salem, his car is not beautiful.”   
(55) ʔana maa laan (Alreem, 31.19) I not sad “I am not sad.”   
(56) maa ʕalft ʔəbuuh laa maa ʃərti (Mohammed, 46.20) not knew father.his no, not policeman “Did not know, his father no, not a policeman.”   
(57) maa haaða maa mǝntuus (Fatima, 47.03) not this not Mentos ${ } ^ { \prime \prime } \mathsf { N o } ,$ this (is) not Mentos.”

In all above cases, the target is mub followed by the corresponding adjectival, nominal, or prepositional predicate and this is what would be expected in the adult language. However, children erroneously substitute maa for mub in most of these cases. In total, children substitute maa for mub in 267 cases, out of a total of 333 contexts where the target negator is mub, an extremely high error percentage of $8 0 . 1 8 \%$ (cf. Table 4).

It is worth noting that, as Table 4 clearly shows, the high percentage of maa-mub substitutions is not because of defective negation production in these contexts by one or two children in the database but is observed across the board.

The data therefore indicate strong effects of input frequency on the observed patterns of negation development. Frequency effects in acquisition can be expected to manifest in (i) frequency (more common CDS forms are used more often by the child); (ii) order of acquisition (more common forms are acquired earlier); (iii) accuracy (more common forms are more accurate), and (iv) error patterns (more common forms substitute for less common forms). Indeed, in the Emirati Arabic data, there is evidence for at least three of these effects. As Tables 3 and 4 indicate, children’s production frequency of the different negators mirrors the pattern in CDS frequency: the more frequent VPN negator maa is acquired earlier and the less frequent NVPN mub emerges later and more frequent maa substitutes for the less frequent mub in a great majority of cases. Nonetheless, these relationships are not strictly proportional. Specifically, while maa is approximately 9 times more frequent in CDS than mub, it is no less than 28 times more frequent in child productions. Furthermore, when the environments where maa-mub substitution occurs are taken into account, it becomes clear that a frequency account alone cannot readily explain the full range of the observed data.

The EMALAC corpus was checked for each environment where NVPN negation would be the expected/required mode of negation, following the patterns observed in the adult language. As we have seen, the NVPN negator mub in adult language precedes nominal, adjectival, and prepositional/ adverbial predicates. A careful examination of these environments in our data reveals an interesting pattern of maa-mub substitution. More specifically, when at later stages (after age 3;6) children start using the correct form mub in non-verbal predicate contexts, this use is not consistent across the different types of predicates. Children seem to use mub more frequently and more accurately with nominal and adjectival predicates, but not with prepositional/adverbial predicates.

The distinction between the different types of predicates in our data is based on both the categorial status of the different non-verbal predicates (nominal, adjectival, prepositional, adverbial) as well as ensuring that the categorial status corresponds to temporal restrictions, reinterpretation of the target predicates as time-bound or atemporal. On the one hand, all cases of nominal predicates denoted permanent properties, such as family relations (e.g., mub ʔmmǝk ‘not your mother’) or substances (haaða mub mǝntuus ‘this is not Mentos’). On the other hand, all cases of adverbial or prepositional predicates denoted temporal properties, for example adverbials (such as maa hni ʔablatna ‘not here our teachers’) or locative prepositional phrases (e.g., maa felyebal ‘not on the mountain (talking about where the father is)’). For the case of adjectival predicates, the distinction was not always clear — see the following discussion.

The class of adjectival predicates can be divided among individual-level adjectives (e.g., intelligent, beautiful, big) and stage-level adjectives (e.g., bored, hot, happy). The former assign more permanentlike properties to the subject of the predicate while the latter assign temporary properties which are only true for a given time t. Thus, stage-level adjectival predicates can be the complements of a perception verb while individual-level adjectival predicates cannot:

In addition, individual-level adjectival predicates behave like nominal predicates and stage-level adjectival predicates behave like prepositional/adverbial predicates with respect to a number of diagnostic tests used in the literature (see Becker 2000a:46-47 for several such tests).

To obtain more precise and relevant measures, we checked all adjectival predicates in the speech of the six children and we separated individual-level adjectival predicates (children most commonly use some version of ħəluu ‘beautiful’ and less frequently size adjectives like kbiir ‘big’) from stage-level adjectival predicates representing temporal properties, such as ħaar ‘hot’, or zǝʕlaan ‘sad’. Table 5 below presents the distribution of mub in different types of nominal, adjectival (IL and SL), and prepositional/ adverbial predicate contexts in the adult, child-directed speech. NVPN mub is required in all of these contexts while maa is illicit. Table 6, provides the commissions errors in child language, where maa substitutes for mub in all of these contexts and where such use would be illicit in adult language.

As is clear from Table 6, mub is about ten times more likely to appear correctly with nominal and adjectival predicates than with prepositional and adverbial predicates. It appears correctly in $1 8 . 1 8 \%$ cases of nominal predicates and $2 6 . 6 6 \%$ of adjectival predicates but only in 1.88 cases of PP and AdvP predicates. This pattern matches the pattern found in the acquisition of copula in English and other languages (discussed in the third section), where we saw that the copula is more likely to appear with nominal and/or adjectival (individual-level) than with prepositional or adverbial (stage-level) predicates.

If we now add the nominal and individual-level adjectives together and the PP/AdvP predicates with the stage-level adjective, we get the following totals (cf. Tables 7 and 8).

In stage-level contexts we only found one case $( 1 \% )$ where mub is used correctly. In all other cases in the database, maa consistently substitutes for mub in both stage-level adjectival predicate contexts and in prepositional and adverbial contexts. In contrast, in both nominal predicates and individual-level adjectival predicates, mub is used correctly in about a bit more of a third of the cases, with the latter used with mub accurately a bit less than half the time. This is a very robust difference in distribution and confirms the results obtained from the distribution of copular elements in languages like English.

In the following section, we discuss possible alternative accounts for these patterns, showing that phonological complexity-based analyses or input and frequency-based analyses run into problems.

# 5. Discussion

We based our discussion on the acquisition of negation markers in Emirati Arabic on two basic assumptions about language development: i) the robust effects of input-frequency on the order of acquisition (as well as the direction of possible commission errors) of morphosyntactic markers in general and negative particles in particular; and ii) the effects of underlying children’s bias on the distribution of IL and SL predicate forms and how it affects patterns of omission and commission errors in the development of VPN and NVPN particles in child EA.

Following an input-frequency account of emergence, we predicted that the NVPN negator mub in Emirati Arabic will be substituted by its more frequent VPN counterpart maa in early stages of acquisition and that its later emergence and frequency of occurrence would follow a similar pattern: mub would emerge earlier and more frequently with individual-stage (nominal/adjectival) predicates and much later with stage-level (prepositional/adverbial) predicates. Both predictions are confirmed by the Emirati Arabic child acquisition data from the EMALAC corpus.

If we separate the data on maa and mub distribution in child language in three different age ranges,13 starting from the earlier stages of acquisition recorded in the database, we see that mub is not produced at all in the early stages (from the first age of 1;9 recorded in the data up to the first occurrence of mub). After it is first recorded at the age of 3;6, it remains at its very low frequency of occurrence for the remainder of the data, showing no significant improvement with age:

As Table 9 shows, VPN negation with maa follows a stable path of production frequency throughout the database, in contrast to mub which is not produced at all in roughly the first three and a half years of age. NVPN mub emerges later and then it is produced in only around $2 . 7 2 \substack { - 2 . 8 0 \% }$ of the total negative contexts in the data, a percentage much lower (less than half) than that of CDS (c.f. Table 3).

An unexpected individual result here is the case of Alreem whose age-range (2;7-4;6) during the data collection period overlaps completely or partially with all three stages listed above and yet we could not find a single occurrence of NVPN mub in all the recorded utterances with negation. Even with the predominance of maa in the input, this is surprising given the predictions that the three-stage development proposed in Table 9 makes and, especially, given the data from other children, such as Hind for example who starts producing mub at her last recorded age of 3;7, as predicted from the Table. We can only attribute this to an individual developmental trajectory, assuming that this particular aspect of development is delayed in Alreem. Obviously, data from many more children would need to be collected in order to accurately establish statistically supported representative stages of negative particle acquisition in the dialect.14

Before discussing these issues further, it is worth noting that additional factors may be relevant in the development of negation markers in Emirati Arabic, but we decided not to explore these here for reasons of parsimony. For example, issues related to phonological complexity may also be relevant given that the NVPN negator mub is phonologically more complex having a coda, in contrast to maa (frequently simplified to ma in child Emirati Arabic), which does not. Studies have shown that morphemes with coda may be phonologically marked and acquired later than open-syllable markers (see studies in Dutch (Fikkert 1994), English (Demuth 1995, Fee & Ingram 1982, Vihman 1992), Spanish and German (Lleó & Prinz 1996)). It is natural then to assume that the overuse of VPN negation maa by Emirati children, in environments where mub would be expected, is simply because of the phonological markedness of the latter, being formed on a closed CVC syllable.

In the analysis proposed here, we have assumed, and the data has supported, an input-frequency based account of the observed patterns of negation emergence in child Emirati Arabic. The more frequent negator in the input maa appears earlier and substitutes for the less frequent negator mub. However, we have also seen that this substitution is context-sensitive. While IL predicate contexts are almost 3 times more common than SL in CDS, they are 30 times more accurate in the children’s production. Finally, even though laa is much more common than mub in the input, it never substitutes for it. In addition, in the total of 746 contexts of anaphoric negation (or imperative negation) where the particle laa is expected/required, maa substitutes for laa in 39 cases, at around $5 . 2 \%$ of error rate. This is an expected result given the much higher frequency of VPN maa in the input compared to the anaphoric negator laa (see Table 3).

If frequency by itself does not provide an adequate explanation of the developmental patterns of negation in Emirati Arabic, with respect to the statistical patterns of maa-mub substitution in SL and IL predicate contexts, how can we capture the statistical patterns observed in the previous section? Why would the NVPN mub appear earlier and accurately with IL predicates but not with SL predicates, where it is substituted by the VPN maa? Here we revisit the distributional differences between IL and SL predicates as discussed in the second section on the development of the copula in child language. We assume, following the discussion in Becker (2000a, 2000b, 2004), that IL predicate structures are ‘richer’ than SL-predicate structures. IL predicates are the equivalent of finite verbs in the verbal predicate domain while SL predicates are the equivalent of non-finite verbal predicates. The ‘richer’ syntactic structure of IL predicates contains a projection where finiteness is expressed, requiring a copular element to be present (realizing this finiteness syntactic projection). This results in mub being selected in Emirati Arabic negative contexts with IL predicates as mub encompasses copular properties (i.e., it is a negative copula). Thus, it is predicted that IL contexts will express NVPN more frequently using the mub negator and will allow for less commission errors where maa substitutes for mub, partially compensating for input-frequency effects. This is exactly what the data show: in nominal predicates mub is used correctly in more than a third of all cases, while in individuallevel adjectival predicates, mub is used accurately a bit less than half the time.

SL predicates, conversely, are assumed to be ‘marked’ in terms of aspectual semantics, encompassing a temporality in the situation described by the predicate. This is syntactically encoded in a reduced syntactic structure where the projection where finiteness is projected is missing. As we have seen in crosslinguistic studies (the second section), this usually results in dropping copular particles in child language. Thus, in the case of Emirati Arabic negation, SL predicates are predicted to allow more commission errors where the non-copular VPN particle maa substitutes for the copular NVPN marker mub, since the projection where the copula should be projected is not available in the SL predicate truncated structure. Again, the observed data confirms this prediction, as we found only one case $( 1 \% )$ where mub is used correctly with SL predicates. VPN maa consistently substitutes for mub in all remaining stage-level adjectival predicate contexts and in prepositional and adverbial contexts.

If this analysis is on the right track, it suggests that while input frequency is important for the availability of the structure to children, the latter remain active participants in the learning process.

Just like in the acquisition of negation in English (Cameron-Faulkner et al. 2007), the children acquiring Emirati Arabic are developing generalisations and hypotheses in their use of the different negators: hypotheses informed, on the one hand, by input frequencies and use and, on the other hand, by their semantic and syntactic complexity.

We propose that the grammaticalization of mub as a negative copula can be construed as one of the factors accounting for its patterns of distribution in IL/SL predicative contexts and its substitution with maa. We argue that if the children were simply replacing a more frequent form for another, we would expect a closer relationship between all three negators maa, laa, and mub, as well as a more direct correspondence between child and adult frequencies. Instead, we postulate that the children parse the negator mub not as a single negative particle but as a negative copula and, facing the learning challenges related partially to its low input frequency, substitute the negator with its more frequent VPN counterpart maa, following a cross-linguistically common child language process of copula development.

# 6. Conclusion

In this paper we examined the distribution of the NVPN negator mub in Emirati Arabic. We have shown that mub is frequently substituted by VPN negator maa, following an expected patterns of development based on the statistical properties of these particles in the input. However, these substitutions follow an asymmetric pattern which resembles the acquisition pattern of copular elements in languages that use copulas in non-verbal predication, such as English. In particular, we have shown that most errors appear with stage-level predicates, the same environments where copulas are frequently dropped in child English (and other languages). We have argued that this seems to indicate that NVPN mub in Emirati Arabic is a negative copula, derived by a grammaticalization process of a string that contains VPN negation maa and a pronominal copula.

It remains to be seen if this can be supported by further evidence in related dialects (some very limited data from Kuwaiti Arabic seems to indicate that this may be the case, see Aljenaie 2008). In addition, it would be interesting to see if similar paths of acquisition are observed in the development of Modern Standard Arabic copular negation laysa (see discussion in the second section, example (24)), as well as related nonverbal predicate negation elements in other dialects of Arabic as well as other languages which use distinct negative elements in such contexts.

It is important to note again that the data reported here is not sufficient to elucidate sufficiently the extent to which the underlying bias in children’s choice of negator in IL and SL contexts affects commission errors. While we show that there seem to be strong indications that Emirati children’s path to the acquisition of the two negative markers is affected by both input-frequency and access to the aspectual/temporary properties of the negated predicates, the data are too sparse to allow for needed statistical analyses. To further elucidate these aspects, it would be necessary to support the preliminary results reported here with experimental work, which would be able to control for certain variables related to frequency and type of predicate.

One possible example would be an Elicited Production Task, consisting of several tokens testing variable conditions that required either the VPN particle maa (e.g., with, adverbial, prepositional, or SL adjectival predicates) or the NVPN particle mub (e.g., with nominal or IL adjectival predicates). The task can include both visual and linguistic clues, eliciting negative predicate responses from children and recording the number of correct answers in the appropriate contexts and the number of possible commission errors. Such an experiment could control for the frequency of the predicateenvironments used in the study (e.g., high-low frequency of adverbial, nominal, adjectival predicates). An experimental design would help us disambiguate the types of predicates used, for example, we could exclude adjectival predicates which can be ambiguous between a permanent or temporary interpretation and use unambiguously IL nominal predicates with permanent properties and SL prepositional or adverbial predicates with clearly temporal properties. Such a design would be able to provide robust results with respect to both frequency effects as well as children’s access to the aspectual properties of the target predicates in choosing the appropriate type of negation marker.
