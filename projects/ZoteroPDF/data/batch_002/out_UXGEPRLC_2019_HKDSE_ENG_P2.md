Paper 2

# General Comments

In general, canddates perfomance ws saisactor as the task was straightforward and the topic relan adperonal xriVey few scris were off topic.High-end scripts containd ouchin ommes eronal feeigs and iting anotes about meorable incidents which conveyed an appropriate sense of nostalgia. The majority of candidates provided ample information in both parts but a few overlooked the specific requirement of the question in the first part, focusing on school life in gneral insted of writing about a subject they had enjoyed Studying or found challenging. Overall, most candidates were able to complete the task using an appropriate tone and style.

# Content

A common approach to the first part of the task was to describe the difficulties encountered when first studying a particular subject and then explain how these were overcome, for example with the help of a particular teacher. This proved to be a successful approach. Some candidates wrote more of an academic essay, however, giving reasons for why a subject was their favourite or trying to build an argument for the subject as the most challenging. Although many of the ideas in such answers were relevant to the topic, this approach was not consistent with the usual style of a yearbook.

In the second part of the task, many candidates wrote movingly on how much they loved their school life, recounting interesting events and citing the uplifing words of teachers or classmates. A graphic was given in the prompt, and although it was not intended that candidates would describe it some weaker candidates did this, which led to restricted answers of limited relevance. Some candidates used the picture more strategically, for example by referring to the hand gesture seen in the photo, to add veracity to their entry. This was considered a sensible approach, although many scripts scored well without making reference to the graphic.

Some candidates chose to write on events which took place outside school premises, e.g. a school picnic. This approach was effective as long as it linked the events described with what the writer would miss most about being a student, such as camaraderie or how classmates supported each other in times of trouble.Anecdotes of this nature were uplifting and fitted the yearbook genre very well.

Stronger candidates tended to include personal touches which revealed their personality, such as messages of goodwill to their classmates and amusing remarks. Weaker scripts lacked these personal touches and were more repetitive, e.g. talking about a teacher in both parts or presenting similar content. Some candidates used the task as an opportunity to grumble about school life, which was not really in the spirit of the task.

# Language

The task required recounting past events and reflecting upon these, so using tenses correctly was important to helping the reader follow the train of thought. The yearbook entry was in the first person but often referenced the experiences of a group of students so it was important for candidates to maintain a consistent voice and identity, and have a clear sense of who the intended reader was.

Question 2 on social issues was the most popular question, with $2 8 \%$ choosing it. The question on popular culture (Q.5) also proved popular while those on drama (Q.6) and poems and songs (Q.7) were the least popular.

The following is a summary of candidates' performance in each question.

Question 2: Learning English through Social Issues

This question required candidates to write an essay for their English teacher on the issue of overseas talent in the context of Hong Kong workplaces.

Most candidates showed an understanding of the requirements of the question and were able to address thebenefitschallenges' and suggestionsSome candidates chose to put forward one or two arguments and to develop these ideas in some detail whereas others presented several Dath annroaches were acceptable.

Question 3: Learning English through Debating

This question required candidates to write a one-sided argumentative esay giving ther opinion on Whether or not socil meda pos cogr sife tol and logical public deate. Arguments were expected obe suppored by cr and convincing reasons, and elaborated on with relevant evidence.

Some candidates strugged with the task requirements. As a result, some essays incuaea ureevant or vague ds and ansrmple some andda deried diffr feresof certain platforms without addressing the issue of public debate. This may be a result of not understanding the meaning of stile or wrongly mterpreting public debate' to mean general communication with friends and family. A further problem was that some candidates failed to follow the reuirements of the question and gae both ides of the argument.

Poor organisation and irrelevant content characterised weaker essays, while stronger canaiaaes wrote convincing arguments with valid and salient examples. Some possessed a wide range of lexical knowledge related to social media and the internet. This made their essays lexically rich and diverse in terms of ideas.

On the whole, candidates had a reasonably good grasp of the language of argumentation, with stronger candidates using more varied and more complex forms for presenting, developing and structuring their arguments.Most candidates were able to adopt a neutral to formal tone, with stronger essays showing a greater sense of audience awareness and using a variety of means to address and engage with the reader e.g. rhetorical devices, different types of pronouns.

Question 4: Learning English through Sports Communication

This question required candidates to write a report on \*the final game of the season' between two rival schools and include a description of an unexpected incident that happened during the game. It was also a requirement to include thoughts and opinions from different people involved'. It was not specified which sport was involved and most candidates wrote about football or basketball.

Candidates who attempted this question were generally familiar with the language used to describe sports and some did include quite imaginative incidents' and provided added description from the points of view of spectators, players or managers. In most cases, though, the incidents described were mundane, such as red cards or injuries to players.

Candidates scoring highly on this question were able to include the required content and write in a style corresponding to a news report, i.e. with short paragraphs and dialogue included, in an engaging and imaginative style.Candidates who received lower marks often failed to provide sufficiently coherent descriptions of the match or incident, or did not add the views of people involved.

# Question 5: Learning English through Popular Culture

Candidates were required to write a news article in which they described where they looked for information about the latest trends in pop culture'. They were given five areas of pop culture to areas of pop culture themselves.

Candidates who did not core highy on this question tended to writ abou the areas of pop they used. lo quie omon was for ad towie mor f s on th r and cons

Question 6: Learning English through Drama

In this queston candidates were required to write a review of a film elling a contemporary version of a children's fairy tale in which Cinderella is a comic book heroine. Candidates had to briefly describe the plot of the new film, how the characters are porrayed in it and why the

There were some very imaginative answers to this question, telling how the director had developed a new story based on the comic book adventures of Cinderella and relating it to modern society by explaining the message that the director wanted to get across in the film.

Candidates who scored lower tended to focus too much on the story and wrote it more as a narrative than a film review. Many also omitted details about the director's reasons for making the film or comparisons with the original story of Cinderella.

Question 7: Learning English through Poems and Songs

This question was only attempted by a small number of candidates.It required them to write a speech for club members in their role as an after-school arts club leader. The focus of the speech was on the role of a critic and how to give and receive criticism. Candidates were expected to focus on all three areas though not necessarily in equal depth nor in the order in which they were listed in the question.

Candidates' definitions of critic' varied, ranging from haters and bullies to people making suggestions to help others improve'. These varying definitions were judged within the context of the speech and how the candidate was able to develop these ideas into a speech for art club members. Criticism that was related to producing art was considered more relevant to the topic than criticism in general.

On the whole, candidates showed that they were familiar with the genre and were able to open and close the speech in appropriate ways. Stronger candidates were skilled in effectively using features of spoken discourse.

Question 8: Learning English through Workplace Communication

Candidates were required to adopt the identity of a volunteer in a local district council office and to write a formal email explaining the thinking behind the design of three campaign posters.Two completed posters were provided and candidates were required to explain these and suggest ideas for a third poster.

Some candidates struggled with interpreting the demands of the task.Some misunderstood campaign' or wrote about employee/employer relationships, while others failed to link the purpose of the posters to the context of the elections. A further problem was that some candidates wrote to Ricky Kwan while some wrote a letter to the editor.

More than half of the candidates successfully explained the messages behind the two poster designs.Stronger candidates focused on both the graphics in the posters and the slogans and made strong connections between these and how they would make a good campaign theme. They limited details.

# Recommendations

Language

Languaghud e onse in f t es aopr th  te and the i exical a gtc evarity of snte strctures ad fm ned to be used where appropriate to the context and intended meaning.

# Coherence

Candidates should shape or sequence ideas within paragraphs and across paragraphs. The flow of ideas should be clear and logical. Longer responses should maintain coherence. If oo many details are included wthout appropriate links or effecie cohesive device, there is a risk of losing the reader. The text should be coherent and structured according to the text type.

Length

Part B requires candidates to write around 400 words. Longer responses will not necessarily gain higher marks simply by virtue of length. If writing beyond the suggested number of words, the length should not impede the communicative effectiveness.
