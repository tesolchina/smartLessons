# ABSTRACT

Event-related potentials (ERPs) have become widespread in second language acquisition (SLA) research and a growing body of literature has been produced in recent years. We surveyed 61 SLA papers that use ERPs to study L2 sentence processing in healthy late learners. Our main aim was to provide a critical summary of findings from the decade 2010-2020. The qualitative review reveals that proficiency plays a major role in determining ERP components, but its effect is modulated by language similarity and individual differences. The statistical analysis (a multinomial logistic regression) suggests that ERP components are uniquely predicted by learners’ proficiency level and the linguistic phenomenon at issue, while no effect of language distance is found. We also made a cursive methodological overview, which evidences several gaps in the literature and raises some concerns on the way proficiency is factorized across studies.

# 1.1. Event-related potentials in language studies

# 1.1.1. The technique

High-temporal resolution experimental techniques, such as Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and Electroencephalography (EEG), reveal that language processing unfolds millisecond-by-millisecond and involves multiple functional processes. EEG records electrical activity coming from post-synaptic potentials by means of electrodes placed on the subject’s scalp. Since the propagation of the signal is instantaneous, EEG has an exquisite temporal resolution. Conversely, given the distance and the variety of tissues—among which grey matter, bones, and skin—that separate signal detectors and signal sources, the resulting spatial resolution is quite poor (for a recent survey of its strengths and weaknesses, see Leckey & Federmeier 2019). Event-related potentials (ERPs) exploit the EEG technique to get insights into cognitive functions. While the EEG is recorded, some kind of stimulus, (e.g., a sentence, a picture, a sound) is presented. This is the ‘event’ to which the brain signal is temporally related, that is, ‘time-locked’. Utilizing ERPs in an informative way first requires establishing a link between a perturbation (amplitude variation) in the EEG waveforms and a certain cognitive operation, which is a problem of forward inference (Kappenman & Luck 2011). Perturbations consistently associated with a certain latency, amplitude, scalp distribution, polarity (positive or negative), and functional interpretation are called ERP components1 (Kappenman & Luck 2011). Once a component has been defined, it can serve as a proxy to infer what cognitive processes are at play in a given experimental condition, which is a problem of reverse inference (Kappenman & Luck 2011).

# 1.1.2. ERPs in first language studies

Thanks to their manageability and efficiency, ERPs have become increasingly popular in both first and second language research. In the early 2000s, Friederici and colleagues conduct a series of seminal experiments on both L1 and artificial language processing. The product of their work is an influential model of language comprehension in which (i) linguistic levels are processed sequentially, (ii) syntactic information is processed first, and (iii) each functional step correlates with a specific ERP component (Friederici 2004, 2002; Hahne & Friederici 1999). Very early morphosyntactic operations, indexed by an early left anterior negativity (ELAN), are followed by categorial evaluation which is marked by a left anterior negativity (LAN). Only after such (morpho)syntactic analyses are completed, semantic elaboration takes place, eliciting an N400, that is, a negative deflection peaking at $4 0 0 \mathrm { m s }$ with a centro-parietal distribution. Finally, the sentence undergoes a third-pass syntactic reanalysis that correlates with a P600, that is, a positive deflection peaking at about $6 0 0 \mathrm { m } s$ with a posterior distribution. This model has been subsequently revised and criticized after new empirical findings challenged the idea of serial processing and syntactic primacy, in favor of a parallel dual-stream hypothesis (for review and proposals, see Baggio 2018, 2021; for theoretical perspectives, see Culicover & Jackendoff 2005, 2006a, 2006b). Moreover, the interpretation, as well as the very existence, of some components has been questioned. In their critical review, Steinhauer & Drury (2012) argue that the cases in which ELAN has been genuinely found are rare and what is reported as ELAN is often just a byproduct of context effects, namely, spill-over and offset effects.2 Moreover, as we see later on, although generally taken as a marker of nativelikeness, the LAN is nevertheless subject to a certain variability among native speakers. The functional connotation of the N400 as the lexical-semantics component by definition has been enriched in recent years, and it is now often associated with anticipatory mechanisms as well (Van Petten & Lukas 2012). Likewise, the P600, which was deemed to be an index of syntactic reanalysis tout court, has been re-evaluated as a signal of global reanalysis, both for syntactic and semantic anomalies that are not necessarily violations (Brouwer & Crocker 2017; Van Petten & Luka 2012; Brouwer et al. 2012). Despite this, the core set of linguistic components can still be identified with LAN, N400, and P600 (for an overview, see Beres 2017; Swaab et al. 2011).

# 1.1.3. ERPs in second language acquisition studies

In this section, we introduce some key findings and models in SLA.

1.1.3.1. Neural correlates of proficiency and acquisition-. Findings in first language research inform the SLA field, as native speakers’ responses were (and are) taken as a benchmark to measure how successful learners are in second/foreign language acquisition: the closer their neural responses are to those of the native speakers, the more proficient they will be. Osterhout and colleagues (Osterhout et al. 2008; McLaughlin et al. 2004, 2010), for example, have observe that after a few months of classroom instruction, the same violations (e.g., subject-verb agreement) that initially elicited an N400 start to cause a P600, which is a more native-like pattern. This shift would track a progress towards the attainment of the target language as learners’ proficiency grows, and Osterhout et al. (2008) call this “proceduralization” or “grammaticalization”. This view is compatible with the Declarative-Procedural Model (DPM) of language acquisition proposed by Ullman (2016, 2001) and Paradis (2009, 2004). In this framework, two memory systems are distinguished on anatomical, physiological, and functional grounds. The declarative memory system supports explicit knowledge and learning, which, generally, can be verbalized and are accessible to introspection. It is instantiated in temporal networks and regulated by acetylcholine. The procedural memory system deals with implicit, automatized knowledge and learning, which are largely unavailable to awareness. This system is mainly located in the basal ganglia, BA 44, 45, and the supplementary motor area, and its activity is modulated by dopamine. Since dopamine and acetylcholine are competing neurotransmitters, the two systems do not support each other, but rather operate in parallel with different timing. In other words, they can handle the same contents with different implementations, which makes them complementary and partially redundant. Learners would initially rely more on declarative memory, whose functioning is marked by an N400. As proficiency increases, though, procedural memory would gradually take up part of the L2 processing workload, which correlates with the emergence of the P600 and, possibly, the LAN.

1.1.3.2. Hypotheses on L2 development and ultimate attainment. Akin to accounts such as the Full Transfer/Full access hypothesis (Schwartz & Sprouse 1996) and the convergence hypothesis (Steinhauer et al. 2009), the DPM does not exclude in principle that native-like attainment is possible. In contrast, many scholars claim that a fundamental difference exists between learners and native speakers (Paradis 2009; Bley-Vroman 2009, 1989, 1988). Evidence in support of this position has mainly come from studies on morphosyntax involving very advanced learners. Several discrepancies between native and nonnative speakers’ responses have been indeed detected in the kind, latency and distribution of ERP components elicited (Díaz et al. 2016) as well as in production data (Prévost & White 2000; Lardiere 1998a, 1998b). However, among the authors just mentioned, only Díaz et al. (2016) have taken such differences as the signal of an unbridgeable gap. Some weaker versions of the Fundamental Difference hypothesis envisage the possibility of a patchy ultimate attainment, in which bits of a native-like system are interspersed with areas of persistent nonnativelikeness. Depending on the account, the latter are ascribed to syntax (e.g., in the Shallow Structure Hypothesis, Clahsen & Felser 2018, 2006), morphosyntax (e.g., the Failed Functional Features Hypothesis/Representational Deficit Hypothesis, Hawkins & Chan 1997; the Bottleneck Hypothesis, Slabakova 2019, 2006), or interfaces (e.g., the Interface Hypothesis, Sorace 2011; Sorace & Filiaci 2006).

1.1.3.3. Predictors of L2 development as indexed by ERP components. The literature individuates several factors that may modulate ERP components, namely, proficiency, the age of L2 onset (AO), language similarity (or language distance), context of acquisition, and individual differences.

Proficiency. As presented in paragraphs 1.1.3.1 and 1.1.3.2, many authors infer the progress in L2 acquisition from the convergence between native speakers’ and learners’ neural patterns (Steinhauer et al. 2009; Osterhout et al. 2008). In that sense, proficiency can be considered a dependent variable that is estimated based on the ERP components. Conversely, proficiency is usually also measured through (standard) assessment tools and questionnaires before the experiment. The scores obtained are then included among the independent variables to explain behavioral and brain responses. The relationship between these two kinds of proficiency is not always straightforward, as high test scores do not necessarily correspond to native-like ERP patterns and vice versa (Díaz et al. 2016; Bowden et al. 2013). Nevertheless, as previous reviews indicate (see Section 1.2), a certain degree of consistency exists between the two, and proficiency scores can explain the great amount of variance found in the results. Much of SLA research has investigated how other factors complement and/or modulate the effect of language skills on electrophysiological data. Another lively debated issue concerns the methodology to factorize, that is, to score, such skills. Some scholars maintain that language performance rises from a complex network of abilities that should be assessed globally using multiple modules (Lehmann 2007; CEFR, Council of Europe 2001; ACTFL, American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Language 2012). As we will see, many researchers choose official tests of the European or American framework to pre-screen their participants. Such tools tap into language comprehension and production in both written and oral modalities. Perhaps a less thorough assessment is provided by sentence (e.g., cloze tests) and word completion tests (e.g., C-test, Raatz & Klein-Braley 1981), which nonetheless involve morphosyntax and discourse integration besides mere lexical knowledge. Other scholars claim that vocabulary size alone can be a reliable proxy for

L2 proficiency (Milton 2013; Meara 2010). Common tests in this domain are naming tests (e.g., Peabody Picture Vocabulary test, L.M. Dunn 1959; D.M. Dunn 2019), and lexical decision tasks (e.g., LexTALE, Lemhöfer & Broersma 2012). Recently, Gaillard and Tremblay (2016: 420) argue that “the selected proficiency test should be sufficiently global that it does not rely on circular logic by being too similar to the target L2 measure investigated.” As a solution, they propose the elicited imitation task which should not favor rote repetition by using sentence of length $7 ( \pm 2 )$ , the critical threshold for items to be retained by working memory (WM) for 2.5-3 seconds. They recommend combining this method with cloze tests to measure bottom-up and top-down knowledge at once. Another method to assess proficiency are questionnaires of self-evaluation (e.g., LEAP-Q, Kaushanskaya et al. 2019), which are considered a resourceful complement to other behavioral tools (Ma & Winke 2019; Oscarson 1989). However, as observed in Section 3.1.5, in many studies, this is the only proficiency assessment tool used, as participants are asked to rate their own language skills without being tested further.

Age of onset (AO). The idea of AO as a predictor of learning outcome dates back to the 1960s and is the main tenet of the Critical Period Hypothesis (CPH, Weber-Fox & Neville 1996; Lenneberg 1967), which states that language, just like other faculties such as vision, must develop within a certain age, otherwise the process becomes impossible (see Steinhauer 2014 for a review). AO effects have been studied by contrasting early and late learners, as well as early learners and native speakers. Some scholars have also started to incorporate it as a continuous variable in state-of-the-art models, like GAMs (Meulman et al. 2015).

Language similarity. According to the language distance hypothesis, proficiency is modulated by the degree of similarity between the L1 and L2. Thus, models like the Competition Model envisage a competition between the features of the two systems, with facilitative transfer for fully overlapping ones, but non-facilitative transfer for conflicting or L2-specific ones (MacWhinney 2005). Unlike the Full Transfer/Full access Hypothesis, the Competition Model maintains that transfer effects cannot be eventually overcome by proficiency, hence, true nativelikeness is precluded. The role of language distance has been assessed by comparing groups of learners with different L1 backgrounds, or native with nonnative speakers on features that are shared, partially shared, or not shared between the two languages.

Context of acquisition. Over forty years ago Krashen (1981) proposed the distinction between “learning” and “acquisition”. By the former he indicates a conscious process whose product is declarative knowledge on a language. Conversely, the latter is subconscious in nature and results in procedural knowledge of a language, which can be applied automatically without the contribution of monitoring mechanisms. This theoretical intuition has found later support in neurolinguistic literature that distinguishes between the declarative and procedural memory systems (Paradis 2009, 2004; Ullman 2016, 2001). A branch of SLA research tried to outline the relationship between the context of acquisition and the outcome of acquisition. People who learn their L2 in a classroom are usually taught grammatical rules explicitly, whereas those who—like immigrants—are exposed to the language in a more naturalistic setting can benefit from massive and meaningful input. Some studies show that immersion-like (i.e., implicit) training leads to native-like neural patterns earlier than explicit training (Faretta-Stutenberg & Morgan-Short 2018; Morgan-Short et al. 2012a, 2012b), while others do not report such an advantage (Batterink & Neville 2013). Further investigation is needed to see whether an isomorphism holds between the context and the content/quality of the acquisition. To date, however, there is evidence that often the correspondence between what is taught and what is learned does not obtain (Van Patten et al. 2012; Lightbown 1983).

Individual differences. Another set of factors contributing to explain language acquisition are “individual differences”. This term encompasses aspects that display a certain degree of variability across individuals. Traditionally, the most studied aspects have been motivation and personal L2 experience (Gardner 2010; Dörnyei & Schmidt 2001), cognitive control (Luque & Morgan-Short 2021), and working memory (WM, Wen et al. 2015). They are often regarded as possible predictors of ERP responses. Over the last decade, however, variance has been observed in neural profiles themselves. In this subsection, we devote our attention to WM and examine extant evidence on variability in neural profiles.

Traditionally defined as a module of the memory system which retains information during the completion of a complex task (Baddeley 1983, 2010), WM is composed of the visuospatial sketch pad, the phonological loop, and the episodic buffer, which are coordinated by the central executive (“MultiComponent Model,” Baddeley 2010). WM capacity is the ability to retain a variable number of objects —usually 5 to 7—for a limited time span—generally 2 to 4 seconds. It is commonly measured via span tests, wherein subjects are presented with a sequence of stimuli for subsequent recall while performing a secondary task (see Conway et al. 2005, for a review). High WM scores have been associated with better learning abilities, which also extend to language acquisition and syntactic processing (Conway et al. 2005). WM is also thought to have a role in phonological decoding and in item reactivation, which is crucial to establishing long-distance dependencies.

The other individual characteristic we discuss has to do with neural responses. In recent years, some authors have started questioning the validity of the grand average method. They argue that computing the mean waveform over all subjects does not return a reliable picture of real responses. When they compare by-subject and by-group averages, they find remarkable discrepancies. For example, what appears to be an N400-P600 biphasic pattern in the group analysis, looks very different in the bysubject analysis, as some subjects show either component and some subjects show both (Tanner et al. 2013). This piece of evidence is relevant to both L1 and L2 literature since it highlights that some variability exists not only among learners but also among native speakers. As a consequence, some of the extant criteria of interpretation of the findings in L2 research might need to be revised. We address these issues throughout the article, first, by discussing how previous reviews treat and address such issues, later, by reporting what emerges from our survey.

# 1.2. Previous reviews of SLA ERP research

Several reviews of the ERP technique have been produced in the field of SLA. In this section, we provide a brief overview of those that examine several factors at once and thus resemble ours in scope and methods. Other works, which deal with specific components (Caffarra et al. 2019; Brouwer & Crocker 2017; Brouwer et al. 2012; Steinhauer & Drury 2012), aspects of processing (Reichle et al. 2016; Kaan et al. 2016) or paradigms (Morgan-Short 2020; Grey 2020), are described in later sections.

Moreno et al. (2008) compare L1 and L2 processing across a wide range of domains, including all linguistic levels, as well as phoneme discrimination in adults and children, and language control (executive control, cognitive control, inhibition, code-switching). These authors do not separate syntactic and morphosyntactic phenomena. Unlike later reviews, they suggest that native and nonnative speakers might engage in qualitatively different analyses even when it comes to semantics. They conclude that nativelikeness can be achieved for more conscious mechanisms (P600) but not for early and automatic ones (ELAN and LAN), hence arguing in favor of a sensitive (rather than a critical) period for language acquisition. In their concluding remarks, they underline the need for more longitudinal studies and designs that go beyond the traditional violation paradigm.

Steinhauer et al. (2009) aim to contribute to the debate on the CPH and propose a model of L2 development over time. After examining both L1 and L2 processing studies, they conclude that there is no evidence that SLA is subject to a critical period. However, they acknowledge that an influence of AO does exist, and it affects (morpho)syntax more than semantics acquisition. AO influence should be disentangled from proficiency, something that previous studies have rarely achieved. They suggest that a good way to do so would be to carry out longitudinal studies using artificial language paradigms; this method would allow researchers to control for the amount of input delivered and the age of onset. Steinhauer et al. (2009) also dissect the construct of proficiency. First, they observe that the native speaker population is not as homogeneous as it is usually assumed to be. Second, they note that we should investigate structure-specific rather than global proficiency because the mastery of a specific construction can be gained regardless of global proficiency. Third, they point out that similar proficiency levels may be characterized by distinct brain signatures depending on the context of acquisition. In the final section, based on previous findings, they outline a six-phase model of L2 acquisition in which each phase corresponds to certain neural patterns and functions: (i) Novice learners do not show any sensitivity whatsoever; (ii) At very low proficiency levels, learners rely on semantic and extralinguistic cues and may show an all-purpose N400; (iii) At low to intermediate levels, a weak P600 starts to emerge as an early index of grammaticalization; (iv) Intermediate learners show a stronger and earlier P600 for sentence repair; (v) Advanced L2 learners start displaying a bilateral AN-P600 pattern; (vi) Native-likeness is indexed by a LAN-P600, which implies automatic processing. Steinhauer et al. (2009) also stress that different constructions and features may be acquired at a different pace. In a later review, Steinhauer (2014) adds other elements to the above picture. First, he argues that many studies supporting the CPH either confound AO and proficiency or are prone to artifacts because the pre-target context differs across conditions. Second, he observes that the influence exerted by the L1 is greatest at lower proficiency level, but it is still present at advanced levels due to bilingual activation. Third, he recognizes that implicit learning mechanisms are still available in adults and may boost the acquisition of native-like competence.

In their review, Van Hell & Tokowicz (2010) analyze some of the issues discussed by Steinhauer et al. (2009). They present three leading accounts in SLA, namely the CPH, the Competition Model, and the Declarative-Procedural Model, and examine them in relation to the available empirical literature. Their conclusions are that nativelikeness in the semantic domain is easier to reach than in the (morpho)syntactic domain. In particular, phrase structure can get to be processed in a nativelike way—with an ELAN-P600 response—only under some circumstances, namely, (i) if the construction is salient enough, (ii) if proficiency is sufficiently high, and (iii) if L1 and L2 are not too dissimilar from each other. As far as morphosyntax is concerned, though, they claim that proficiency is a stronger predictor than AO and language distance. They also echo Steinhauer et al. (2009) in tracking a change in neural responses as proficiency increases. Finally, they underscore that crossstudy comparability is sometimes undermined by proficiency being factorized in too diverse ways, and that AO effects are often confounded with proficiency.

Morgan-Short (2014), draw similar conclusions, namely, that L2 development has a neural counterpart, that proficiency is the most important factor in acquisition, and that implicit (as opposed to explicit) learning speeds up native-like attainment. However, they also point out that language similarity has an impact on the acquisition process, which can be slowed down if there is only partial overlap between L1 and L2 features. Additionally, there are other variables which deserve some consideration, e.g., verbal attitude, length of residence, and motivation.

The first empirical review on L2 syntactic processing was performed by Caffarra et al. (2015). They systematically examine 41 articles to assess the influence of target linguistic features, language distance, AO, proficiency, and learning context on ERP components. They observe that most L2 acquisition models (including The Full Transfer/Full Access Hypothesis, the Competition Model, and the Functional Features Model) are based on the assumption that the L1 is the baseline for L2 syntactic analysis and L1 processing influences L2 processing. To test such an assumption, in their final logistic regression model, Caffarra et al. (2015) include L1-L2 similarity, AO, proficiency, training, and immersion duration, as independent and the presence/absence of ERP components (ELAN, LAN, N400, P600) as dependent variables. They create two separate models for L2 speakers (who learned the language naturalistically through immersion) and L2 learners (“traditional” classroom learners). The two groups differ from each other in relevant ways. The ELAN is associated with phrase structure violations due to word omissions, word category violations, and/or wrong word order. It is more frequent in L2 speakers but none of the factors prove a reliable predictor. The LAN correlates with (morpho)syntactic violations and immersion duration in L2 speakers. N400 is found in cases of person and case violations in both groups alike. With respect to L2 speakers, the N400 correlates with AO (though the authors suggest that experimental design might be the cause of its emergence instead); as for classroom learners, the N400 is independent of proficiency. Conversely, P600 is linked to morphosyntactic violations and conscious processes, and is explained by (self-declared) proficiency in L2 speakers, while in L2 learners it becomes more likely with longer training. Remarkably, they detect no significant effect of L1-L2 similarity. Commenting on their results, they call for studies able to disentangle L2 exposure and AO, for example, by recruiting subjects who moved from the L2 speaking country early in life.

In sum, previous reviews converge on four main points; (i) proficiency is a major factor in acquisition and (ii) has visible neural correlates; (iii) AO and language similarity also explain some variance in ultimate attainment, but (iv) further investigation is needed to tease apart AO from proficiency effects, and better characterize the role played by L1 influence and individual differences.

# 1.3. Present review

The present review aims to replicate and possibly enrich the insights from the aforementioned reviews. We followed the general structure of Caffarra et al.’s (2015) work. We considered AO, proficiency, language similarity, target linguistic features, mode of acquisition, and individual differences as predictors, and the ERP components found in the experiments as dependent variables. However, our review differs in some respects from the reviews discussed in the previous section. First, we examined all linguistic levels involved in sentence processing, including semantics, pragmatics, and interfaces, as well as the type of group contrasts under investigation. Second, although this was not our main goal, we tried to provide a critical overview of current research practices. To this end, we reported data on the number of stimuli and participants per condition, presentation modality, task, and measures of proficiency and working memory. We paid special attention to proficiency assessment tools because we believe they are a crucial methodological issue. Indeed, some scholars note that cross-study comparability is unattainable since proficiency is measured in too varied ways (Rastelli 2018; Van Hell & Tokowicz 2010). Rastelli (2018), for example, observes that self-reports are often used as the only proficiency indicator or are complemented by tests in which no spoken interaction is required. Rather, subjects are mostly evaluated by paper-and-pencil tests, with no time constraints. As he points out, such methods cannot hope to capture the ability of using the L2 in the real world. Since researchers take certain ERP responses (e.g., the N400 to $\mathrm { P 6 0 0 }$ shift in McLaughlin et al. (2010), to name one) as neural correlates of acquisition and proficiency, it is essential that the latter is operationalized and that the criteria are shared among the scientific community. This practice may at least partly reduce the risk of circularity between explananda—the ERP signals—and the proposed explanations, for example, learners’ proficiency level.

Our guiding questions were:

(1) What features are held to be processed in a nativelike way by adult L2 learners? (2) What is the impact of proficiency, AO, language distance, context of acquisition, and individual differences (i.e., WM and neural profiles) on the ERP components?

To address these questions, we collected a sample of 61 papers and examined it in three steps. First, we analyzed the distribution of each feature descriptively. Then, we made a qualitative review of the studies to summarize their major findings. Finally, we performed inferential statistics to evaluate the relative weight of a subset of predictors in the presence of ERP components, namely, the P2, LAN, N400, ANTERIOR NEGATIVITY, P600, LATE POSITIVITY, LATE NEGATIVITY. Unlike LAN, N400, and P600, whose importance is evident from the above, we did not include the other ERP components a priori, but rather as we found them reported in the studies. We chose not to consider the ELAN since its very existence is questionable (Steinhauer & Drury 2012).

Finally, two notes on terminology are needed. The first regards the use of the word “nativelikeness.” Following the works cited previously (Section 1.1.3.1), our criterion to define “nativelikeness” is the similarity between learners’ and native speakers’ responses. Likewise, a feature is considered “acquired” when it is processed in a native-like way, that is, when the associated ERP components in learners closely resemble those in native speakers. The present review, then, is not concerned with nativelikeness in terms of behavioral performance. In fact, neural changes may or may not be accompanied by changes in behavior, and vice versa (Díaz et al. 2016; Bowden et al. 2013). The second note is about the use of the words “paper,” “study,” and “experiment.” In general, we use them interchangeably. However, especially in section 3.2, we sometimes say that a certain parameter is observed in, for example, 7 papers and 6 studies. This is because it may be the case that a study comprises multiple experiments which are reported each in a separate paper.

# 2. Methodology

# 2.1. Search and selection process

The present paper is a scoping review of studies that use the ERP technique in SLA research (Munn et al. 2018). Unlike systematic reviews, a scoping review provides an initial map of the existing literature without assessing the quality and the statistical comparability of the results. We focused on a specific time window, stimulus type, and learner population. We included articles from the decade 2010-2020 that investigate sentence processing in healthy late learners. By “late learners” we mean people who acquired their L2 after the age of ten (Caffarra et al. 2015) or are so defined by the authors of the study. We were interested in subjects who received some classroom instruction, possibly enriched by a variable amount of immersion in the L2-speaking country. We excluded special instances of this category such as interpreters and spontaneous learners (e.g., immigrants).

We conducted multiple searches on the Scopus and PubMed databases, two of the main aggregators of research articles. We used the same set of keywords for both databases (Online Supplementary Table 1). The last search was run on February 5, 2022. We identified 3,870 records in PubMed and 2,343 in Scopus. Seven more records were identified among the papers suggested by an anonymous reviewer. After duplicate removal, we were left with 1,903 records for abstract screening, which resulted in 1,829 exclusions. We thus read 74 articles in full and removed further 13 records for not meeting participant inclusion criteria, namely, AO and context of acquisition, or because they did not provide enough information on their subjects. Therefore, in the end, 61 papers were included in our analysis. The process is summarized in the PRISMA flowchart (Figure 1; Moher et al. 2009).

# 2.2 Features of interest

We chose our features of interest prior to the review process. We coded papers along six main dimensions, which were further analyzed into multiple features. A detailed inventory is provided in the following paragraphs. The complete descriptive comparative grid is available as SM.

# 2.2.1. Design, task and presentation

We divided the studies under analysis into cross-sectional and longitudinal. A study is defined “crosssectional” when participants are tested in a single session, whereas if the same participants are tested at different points in time, the study is called “longitudinal.”

Under “task,” we reported the task(s) participants had to perform during the EEG recording. In Acceptability Judgment Tasks (AJT), subjects have to decide whether a sentence is well-formed or not. In the “comprehension task” category, we included tasks involving passive reading or listening, optionally accompanied by comprehension questions. Based on the tasks used in the reviewed papers, we introduced three more task categories, i.e., “sentence boundary decision” (press a button when you detect the end of the sentence), “semantic relatedness” (“is this word related to the preceding sentence?”), and “word recognition” (“was this word present in the last sentence?”).

Figure 1. PRISMA flowchart of the selection process.

# 2.2.2. Languages

By $^ { \mathfrak { e } } \mathrm { L } 1 ^ { \mathfrak { n } }$ we mean participants’ first language, by “target language” the language they are learning and which is also tested in the experiment. We reported the name of each language together with its typological genus (Romance, Sinitic, Germanic, etc.) and family (Sino-Tibetan, Afro-Asiatic, IndoEuropean, etc.) according to the WALS classification3 Artificial languages were assigned to “artificial” for both genus and family unless they were miniature versions of natural languages, in which case they inherited the typological categories of the original language. Obviously, in the case of native controls, L1 and target language coincide.

# 2.2.3. Number of participants and stimuli

Under “final number of participants” we reported the number of participants whose data were eventually included in the analyses. We also computed the “number of participants per condition.” Along with the number of stimuli, this information aims to provide an indication of the statistical power of the study.

# 2.2.4. Contrast

When experiments involved more than one group of participants, we registered the feature they were contrasted on under “contrast.” Some studies involve more than one contrast, while some others involve none. The “native-nonnative” contrast means that learners are compared with a control group of native speakers or the same group of participants is tested both on their L1 and their L2. The “proficiency level” contrast involves the comparison of learners at different proficiency levels. We named the contrast $^ { \mathfrak { e } } \mathrm { L } 1 ^ { \mathfrak { n } }$ when L2 speaker samples with different L1s are recruited to examine the influence different L1s may exert on acquisition. The “Training” contrast applies to those experiments in which groups receive different types of laboratory training prior to performing the task. Finally, other contrasts we occasionally individuated in the papers under analysis are “monolingual-bilingual” (in Grey et al. 2018), “early-late bilinguals” (in Foucart et al. 2014 and Díaz et al. 2016), and “context of acquisition” (in Bowden et al. 2013). The first two are not relevant to the present review, but since the experiments that contain them were worth including in the survey, we reported these contrasts in the comparative grid (see SM) and considered them when describing feature distribution (section 3.1.4). To simplify inferential analyses, as for Foucart et al. (2014), we excluded the early bilinguals’ group and only kept the high-proficient late learner and native speaker groups, while from Díaz et al. (2016), we kept both the late and early learner groups and we reassigned them to the intermediate and high proficiency groups, respectively. As for the last contrast, i.e., “Context of acquisition”, it captures those studies in which subjects acquire their language outside of a laboratory in a different way, e.g., abroad in an immersive environment or in a classroom in their home country. This feature was not included as a predictor in the inferential statistical analysis.

# 2.2.5. Pre-screening information

Within pre-screening information, we included proficiency level, proficiency measures, AO, the presence/absence of working memory testing, and the context of acquisition.

Under “proficiency” we recorded the scores obtained or declared by participants in the prescreening phase. For the statistical analysis, we then relabeled them as “high proficiency”, “intermediate proficiency” and “low proficiency”, which correspond to $7 5 \%$ and $5 0 \%$ correct as cut-offs between levels (Caffarra et al. 2015). In the “proficiency measure” column we also reported the type of proficiency assessment employed. “Questionnaire” is a broad label that applies to any kind of pre-screening questionnaire, where subjects are typically asked to evaluate their language skills on a Likert scale. When a standardized test was used, we reported the name of the test in the descriptive grid (e.g., TEM-4, DELE, etc . . .), but for statistical purposes, we eventually classified it into broader categories (see Online Supplementary Table 2 for correspondences). Each test was named “language test” if it assesses global proficiency, “grammar test” if it focuses on grammatical features, “vocabulary test” if it addresses lexical knowledge, “cloze test” if participants have to fill in blanks in a text with words of various categories, “lexical decision task” if participants have to judge whether the target is a real word, “experimental” if behavioral experimental measures are taken as indicators of proficiency (e.g., in Morgan-Short et al. 2010, accuracy in an online chess game). There are also minor tasks which are employed only in one or two of the sampled studies, i.e., “verbal fluency task”, “sentence completion task”, “translation task”, and “elicited imitation task” as well as “interview”. If the test used was normalized, we added the word “standard” to the aforementioned labels, and obtained the following three categories: “standard language test”, “standard lexical decision task”, and “standard vocabulary test”.

“Age of onset” is the age at which participants, reportedly, started to be significantly exposed to the target language.

“Working memory” refers to whether participants’ WM capacity is tested. For completeness, in the general descriptive grid (see SM), we also reported specific WM memory assessment tools.

“Context of acquisition” indicates how nonnative speakers learned their L2. “Instructed” refers to classroom-based learning that normally takes place in the home country; “immersion” is used for people who acquired the L2 mainly by natural exposure abroad; “immersion instructed” concerns those L2ers that received formal foreign language instruction but also spent some time (more than one month) in an L2-speaking country (e.g., Erasmus students).

# 2.2.6. Target linguistic feature

The “target linguistic feature” is the linguistic phenomenon under investigation. For the sake of simplicity, specific features were further grouped into more general linguistic levels: “syntax”, “morphosyntax”, “semantics”, and “pragmatics”. We also included the interface levels “syntaxdiscourse interface”, “(morpho)syntax-prosody interface” and “semantics-pragmatics interface”. The resulting classification, which can be found in Online Supplementary Table 3 was agreed upon by the two authors (interrater agreement $= 0 . 9 1 6$ , measured via Cronbach alpha from the package ltm, R version 4.1.3 (R Core Team 2020)).

The category “syntax” includes phenomena regarding either surface relations among linearized items at the sentence level or displacement and hierarchical phrase-structure, such as – respectively – word order and filler-gap constructions (e.g., Carnie 2021; Koeneman & Zeijlstra 2017).

We considered as pertaining to “morphosyntax” those inflectional features that relate systematic changes in word form to systematic changes in word meaning (e.g., tense, number and gender agreement, etc.) (Aronoff 2013).

The category “Semantics” includes (in)congruency phenomena in which a word is (not) appro priate given a certain preceding context.

We classified as “pragmatics” the tasks testing participants’ world knowledge (Foucart et al. 2015a, 2015b), for example, the (in)congruency between the content of the message and the speaker’s voice.

The category “Interfaces” encompasses multiple linguistic levels at once. The “syntax-discourse interface” deals with the interaction between sentence structure and discourse structure, which, for instance, is at play in anaphora resolution and focus processing. The “(morpho)syntax-prosody interface” pertains to cases in which (morpho)syntax is influenced or expressed by prosodic means, as in prosodically cued phrasal boundaries and stem tones with morphosyntactic values. Manipulations of both semantic and world-knowledge consistency fall into the “semanticspragmatics interface” category, and, finally, when prosody affects semantic acceptability, such as in sentences uttered in a nonnative accent, we refer to “semantics-prosody interface.”

# 2.2.7. ERP components

ERP components are the dependent variables in electrophysiological research, as well as in our analysis. In the comparative grid (see SM), each of the seven components found in the papers reviewed is reported in a separate column: P2, LAN, ANTERIOR NEGATIVITY, N400, P600, LATE NEGATIVITY, LATE POSITIVITY. We followed the classification adopted by the author(s) of each study. Together with the presence/absence of the component, we provided details on the linking between the component and the stimuli. Although we included the full range of components in the statistical analysis, we were mainly interested in the LAN, N400, and P600, which are well established indexes of language processing (see Section 1.1).

# 2.3. Statistical analysis

We ran a multinomial logistic regression (MLR) using the R software (version 4.5.0., R Core Team 2020) to see whether participants’ proficiency, L1, target language (TL), target language proficiency level (TLEVEL) and feature (TFEAT), typological genus of the L1 (L1GEN) and of the target-language (TLGEN), contrast between language genera (GENCON), kind of task (TASK), and context of acquisition (KACQ) predicted the number and type of ERP components found by the sampled studies. The number of ERP components (COMPONENT) was regressed onto the predictors in the domains of syntax, morphosyntax, semantics, pragmatics, and interface phenomena. The MLR technique allows to employ a logistic regression in cases of multiclass problems, when researchers must deal with more than two possible nominal outcomes. It assumes that the dependent variable is a probabilistic event which is a function of cumulative probabilities ranging from 0 to 1 (Agresti 2015).

In our analysis, first, we examined data from learners and native speakers separately, then we pooled them together including only those studies in which the two groups are directly contrasted. We repeated the analyses twice, first with TLEVEL, and then with TFEAT instead. In this latter case, we focused on those features that are most represented in the sample, so as to obtain more robust results. We always started with a maximal model, and then we dropped less significant predictors stepwise.

The output of the models was evaluated using the function analysis of variance (ANOVA, type II) employed in between-model comparisons. Finally, we conducted pairwise contrasts for each factor of the selected models through emmeans (R software, library emmeans). Contrasts are reported as significant with a Tuckey-corrected $\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 5$ . The full datasets and markdown files are provided as Online Supplementary Materials. Since each paper is the source of multiple datapoints we decided to check whether our results were driven by any specific paper. To this end, we included TITLE as a factor and reran the best model (see the following section) for each unique title found, each time leaving out the datapoints provided by one study.

# 3. Results

In the next paragraphs we present, in this order, descriptive statistics of feature distribution, a qualitative overview of the literature, and the results of inferential statistics.

# 3.1. Feature distribution

# 3.1.1. Design, task, and presentation

Fifty-five out of 61 studies $( 9 0 . 1 6 \% )$ adopted a cross-sectional design. Most experiments used either an acceptability judgment task $( 6 6 . 1 0 \% )$ or a comprehension task $( 2 7 . 1 2 \% )$ . Stimuli were presented visually in $8 2 . 7 6 \%$ of the studies.

# 3.1.2. Languages

Among the 11 target languages, English is the most frequent $( 4 2 . 6 2 \% )$ , followed by Spanish $( 1 9 . 6 7 \% )$ . Consequently, Germanic $( 5 9 . 0 2 \% )$ and Romance $\left( 3 4 . 4 3 \% \right)$ are the most frequent genera, while the Indo-European family represents the majority of the target languages tested in the sampled studies $( 9 3 . 4 4 \% )$ ).

The picture for the L1s is more varied since there are 15 different L1s. English $( 2 6 . 3 9 \% )$ shares its primacy with German $( 1 9 . 4 4 \% )$ , Mandarin $( 1 8 . 0 6 \% )$ , and Spanish $( 1 1 . 1 1 \% )$ . Therefore, Germanic is the dominant genus $( 5 1 . 3 9 \% )$ , while Sinitic and Romance make up $1 9 . 4 4 \%$ of the genera each. IndoEuropean $( 7 6 . 6 1 \% )$ and Sino-Tibetan $( 1 9 . 4 4 \% )$ families make up almost the total of the L1s.

We also examine the typological distance between the target language and the L1. Out of 57 unique studies, 43 $( 7 5 . 4 3 \% )$ feature languages that belong to different genera; of these, 21 ( $3 6 . 8 4 \%$ of the total) feature languages which also belong to different families.

# 3.1.3. Number of participants and stimuli

A total of 1,788 learners take part in the studies we review, with an average of 19.86 $\mathrm { \Delta  ^ { \circ } S D } = 8 . 0 7 \mathrm { \Omega } ,$ ) subjects per group and 5.42 $\mathrm { \Delta } \left( \mathrm { S D } = 3 . 4 3 \right) ,$ ) per condition.

Data from 823 native speakers are analyzed in the experiments we collect, distributed over 41 groups with an average of 20.07 $\mathrm { S D } = 5 . 6 8 ) $ ) participants per group and 5.51 $\mathrm { \ S D } = 2 . 2 0 )$ per condition. In each experiment, each subject is administered an average of 149.91( $\mathrm { S D } = 7 0 . 2 4 ,$ experimental stimuli in total and 37.64 $( \mathrm { S D } = 1 4 . 6 0 ) $ ) per condition.

# 3.1.4. Contrast

Eleven studies out of 61 involve two group contrasts, 8 none, resulting in a total of 65 contrasts. The comparisons between native and nonnative speakers $( 6 3 . 0 8 \% )$ and proficiency levels $( 2 0 \% )$ are the most frequent contrasts, while those between contexts of acquisition are investigated in $7 . 6 9 \%$ of the studies. The remnant is represented by the contrasts between early and late bilinguals $\left( 3 . 0 7 \% \right)$ , L1 $( 3 . 0 7 \% )$ , monolingual and bilingual $( 1 . 5 3 \% )$ , and context of acquisition $( 1 . 5 3 \% )$ .

# 3.1.5. Pre-screening information

Proficiency is measured in various ways. All studies gather information about proficiency using a questionnaire. Fourteen of them $( 2 4 . 1 3 \% )$ do not test it any further, 34 use a questionnaire together with another measure, and 13 $( 2 2 . 4 1 \% )$ employ more than one measure besides the questionnaire. Among these assessment tools, standard language tests $( 3 8 . 9 8 \% )$ and standard lexical decision tasks $( 1 1 . 8 6 \% )$ together make up half of the total sample. The remainder is formed of sparse non-standard methods.

Eighty-four different groups of learners are involved in the experiments collected here. For 77 groups, information about proficiency is available, and the breakdown is as follows: 46 groups $( 5 9 . 7 4 \% )$ include high-proficiency learners, 17 groups $( 2 2 . 0 8 \% )$ include intermediate-proficiency learners, and 14 groups $( 1 8 . 1 8 \% )$ include low-proficiency learners (Figure 2).

Information about AO is available for 44 learner groups, and the overall average is 14.31 years (SD $= 4 . 2 1 \dot { }$ ).

In $7 . 9 4 \%$ of the groups, learners acquired the TL through lab training, but among those who learned it in a natural environment, $6 0 \%$ were instructed and spent a variable time in immersion $( 5 . 7 1 \%$ of these learners are also administered lab training), while $4 0 \%$ only received classroom instruction $( 4 . 3 5 \%$ of these learners are also administered lab training).

# 3.1.6. Target linguistic feature

For simplicity, we collapse our fine-grained interface labels into the more general category “Interfaces.” Among the 71 papers we examine, 16 (15 studies) target syntax, 34 (27 studies) morphosyntax, 18 (18 studies) semantics, 2 (2 studies) pragmatics, and 12 (12 studies) interfaces (Figure 3). Five experiments address two to three linguistic levels at a time. As for the targeted linguistic phenomena, agreement is the most frequently investigated (28 studies out of 71), followed by semantic consistency (17 studies) and word order (nine studies).

# 3.1.7. ERP components

N400 and P600 are the components that are most consistently found both in general and across proficiency levels.

If we contrast all learners with native speakers, we see that $6 1 . 8 5 \%$ of the experiments report P600 values for learners and $7 2 . 7 2 \%$ for native speakers. N400 is reported $4 7 . 4 2 \%$ of the times for learners and $3 8 . 6 3 \%$ for native speakers. LAN is reported $1 4 . 4 3 \%$ of the time for learners and $1 8 . 1 8 \%$ for native speakers. Early positivities, non-lateralized anterior negativities and late positivities are not frequently reported for both learners ( $8 . 2 4 \%$ ; $7 . 2 1 \%$ ; $3 . 0 9 \%$ , respectively) and native speakers ( $6 . 8 1 \%$ ; $6 . 8 1 \%$ ;

$4 . 5 4 \%$ . Late negativities are included in $1 4 . 4 3 \%$ of the studies for learners and $6 . 8 1 \%$ for native speakers. Counts are shown in Figures 4 and 5 for native speakers and learners, respectively.

When analyzing the studies that directly compare native and nonnative speakers, we counted how frequently a component elicited by controls is also elicited by learners. This obtains 1 out of 3 times for the P2, 5 out of 8 times for the LAN, 13 out of 17 times for the N400, 2 out of 3 times for the non-lateralized anterior negativities, 25 out of 32 times for the P600, 2 out of 3 times for the late negativities, and 2 out of 2 times for the late positivities. This indicates that, overall, $7 3 . 5 2 \%$ of the experiments comparing native and nonnative speakers observe at least one qualitatively similar component in the two populations.

We address the relationship between linguistic features and ERP components in Section 3.3.

# 3.2. Qualitative overview of the findings

# 3.2.1. What can learners learn?

3.2.1.1. Syntax. Sixteen papers (15 studies) address syntax either alone or in combination with semantics and/or morphosyntax. The syntactic structures tested involve word order for the most part, but also include filler-gap dependencies (Jessen et al. 2019, 2017), passive constructions (Chang & Wang 2016), and ellipsis (Kaan et al. 2016; Chang & Wang 2016).

![](img/1d0715552b87328c11346b48b6cc9cd0102b87820262432c63f1df8ecc918a0f.jpg)  
Figure 5. Number of learners’ groups eliciting each component.

Word order violations elicit a P600 in native speakers and also advanced learners. Nonetheless, there is a certain degree of variability in earlier components. For instance, with respect to native speakers, a LAN is observed for some but not for all. Bowden et al. (2013), report a LAN for both learners and native speakers, followed by a P600 and a late negativity, respectively. In Batterink & Neville (2013), while a P600 (but not a LAN) is observed only in learners with higher behavioral, a LAN-P600 pattern is found for the French native speakers tested on word order violations in “MiniFrench.” The LAN, and to a lesser extent also the P600, may have lower amplitude, later onset, and slightly different distribution (e.g., a right-lateralized LAN as observed by Andersson et al. 2019) in nonnative speakers. Learners at higher levels of proficiency show P600 effects that are qualitatively similar to those shown by the native speakers in response to filler-gap dependencies, passive constructions, and ellipsis violations. However, even advanced learners might be less efficient when it comes to syntactic computation per se. In Jessen et al. (2019), for example, learners, but not native speakers, show a larger P600 at disambiguating regions for plausible (as opposed to implausible) fillers, indicating that, for learners, syntactic repair is more difficult when no additional (semantic) cues are available. In Dallas et al. (2013), the reverse is observed, that is, the load of syntactic processing impinges on semantic processing. Using both filler-gap and non-filler-gap sentences containing semantic violations, they record a native-like N400 in learners only when no gap is involved, while in native speakers the effect is not reduced in the more syntactically complex condition.

In sum, the P600 seems to signal native-likeness when it comes to syntactic violations (although not exclusively), while the LAN is more subject to variation, even in native speakers. As reported in Section 3.1.7, learners and native speakers converge on P600 in 25 out of 32 cases.

3.2.1.2. Morphosyntax. Thirty-four papers (27 studies) address morphosyntax alone or along with syntax and/or semantics. The most investigated features are number agreement and gender agree ment. Four experiments consider other phenomena, namely, verb tense inflection (White et al. 2012; Esfandiari et al. 2020), ergative case marking in Basque (Díaz et al. 2016), and Italian auxiliary-gerund /infinitive constructions (Citron et al. 2011). The studies reviewed contribute to the long-standing debate on whether L2ers can acquire features that are absent in their L1. The typical native-like response to morphosyntactic violations is a P600 possibly preceded by a LAN, while nonnative-like reactions can be either null or take the form of an N400.

There is a minimal amount of evidence supporting non-learnability. In Díaz et al. (2016), SpanishBasque early bilinguals exhibit nonnative reactions to object-verb agreement and ergative case alignment, that are unique to the L1, irrespective of AO, while they perform in a native-like fashion it comes to shared features, like subject-verb agreement. Conversely, many studies demonstrate that native-like processing is possible. Dowens et al. (2010) report more native-like responses (stronger $\mathrm { P 6 0 0 }$ and a LAN) to number agreement than to gender agreement, and attribute this behavior to transfer from L1 English to L2 Spanish. In Morgan-Short et al. (2010), a P600 is only elicited by determiner-noun violations, while adjective-noun gender agreement violations cause an N400 in highproficiency learners. However, Foucart & Frenck-Mestre (2011, 2012) note that native-likeness (P600) is independent of the L1. They recruit German and English learners of French and test them on gender agreement, a feature that is present in German but not in English. German speakers display a P600 in the determiner-noun condition, but not in the noun-adjective and in the L1-like adjective-noun conditions. English speakers, by contrast, show a P600 in the non-L1-like noun-adjective condition, but not in the L1-like adjective-noun and noun-predicative adjective condition. The authors suggest that these different reactions might be due to processing demands. Determiner-noun and nounadjective agreement is indeed more salient in French than adjective-noun agreement and more local than the agreement between a noun and a predicative adjective. Plus, as Morgan-Short (2014) point out in their review, features that are shared between the two languages but are realized in different ways might pose the problem of detrimental competition. Experiments by Alemán Bañón and his colleagues (Gabriele et al. 2013; Alemán Bañón et al. 2014, 2018) point to similar conclusions. They observe that English learners of Spanish show sensitivity to number and gender agreement violations as their proficiency increase, even though this is more pronounced in within-phrase than acrossphrase violations; this difference obtains also for native speakers. Finally, turning our attention to subject-verb agreement, even learners whose L1 lacks this feature (e.g., Mandarin speakers) can learn to processed it in a native-like manner, though this might require e a very long time and/or exposure to large amounts of input (Deng & Cheng 2019, Deng et al. 2015; Xue et al. 2013). Deng et al. (2016) and Son (2020) observe that higher-proficiency learners are more able to decompose incoming words into stem and suffix, as indexed by both early components (LAN) and later (P600) components. This seems to be true even for L2ers whose L1 lacks verb morphology, like Mandarin. Some studies also test subjective grammatical representations, that is, what learners believe to be possible/impossible in the L2. Lemhöfer et al. (2014, 2020) set out to compare responses to objective and subjective gender and number agreement violations. They see that as far as subjective representations are concerned, learners react to violations in a native-like way, as a P600 and even a LAN are recorded. It should be noted, however, that they test L1-German learners on Dutch determiner-noun agreement, a feature common to both the L1 and the L2. A final remark on Lemhöfer et al. (2020) has to do with their experimental task. This is the only study in our sample that directly contrasts a comprehension task with an AJT. Interestingly, native-like components are only recorded when participants perform the AJT, but not when they read a text for comprehension or learning purposes.

3.2.1.3. Pragmatics. Only two studies in our sample focus solely on pragmatics (Foucart et al. 2015a, 2015b). This is partly because we adopt a rather strict notion of pragmatics as a world-knowledge phenomenon disentangled from other linguistic levels. Interactions between pragmatics and other linguistic subfields are considered interface phenomena. Overall, it seems that advanced learners can integrate non-linguistic information online, though not exactly in the same way as native speakers do. As for moral values (Foucart et al. 2015a), while native speakers detect immorality as early as $4 0 0 \mathrm { m s }$ after word onset (N400), L2ers only do so at a later time and show a late positivity, which is also common to native speakers. In the other study (Foucart et al. 2015b), where the speaker’s gender or age consistency is at issue, the late positivity induced by pragmatic violation arises earlier in learners than in native speakers, although the latter are faster in detecting semantic anomalies. A possible interpretation of these findings is that learners tend to defer sentence repair as late as possible and rely more on extralinguistic cues to accomplish this task.

3.2.1.4. Semantics. Eighteen experiments target semantics alone or together with another linguistic level. The typical response to semantic violations or lexical expectations in native speakers is the N400 and learners are found to display similar patterns even at non-advanced proficiency levels (Bowden et al. 2013).

The interpretation of N400 may be challenging at lower proficiency levels as it looks more like an all-purpose response that indexes a general anomaly detection without being restricted to lexicon and semantics (see for instance Esfandiari et al. 2020).

At higher proficiency levels, while patent semantic violations in simple sentences are usually processed by learners and native speakers alike, some discrepancies emerge when it comes to more complex cases. Xue et al. (2014), for example, observe a robust N400 for violations in the spatial metaphor condition but not in the temporal metaphor condition. Along the same lines, the reader may recall that learners in Dallas et al. (2013) prove neurally sensitive to semantic violations only in the nogap, i.e., the syntactically simplest, condition.

Regarding prediction abilities, while Martin et al. (2013) report that learners, unlike native speakers, cannot anticipate incoming nouns before the article appears, Foucart et al. (2014) claim that they can. They explain these divergent results in terms of typological distance between the L1 and the L2. Martin et al. (2013) test learners whose L1 (English) is further apart from the L2 (Spanish) compared to Foucart et al.’s (2014) learners (French-Spanish bilinguals). Therefore, typologically closer languages would give rise to more native-like anticipation processes.

3.2.1.5. Interface phenomena. Twelve papers investigate interface phenomena, but since the target features tested are quite varied, it is not easy to draw general conclusions from the results of these papers. However, some facts can be reasonably outlined.

Across the board, even at very high proficiency levels, learners struggle to integrate multiple interrelated cues. What is often evident is that they do notice hints and incongruencies in the input, but do not use them as native speakers typically do, as indicated by qualitatively distinct components (Reichle & Birdsong 2014; Romero-Rivas et al. 2017). In Reichle & Birdsong (2014), both native and nonnative speakers are sensitive to contrastive focus as opposed to informative focus, but while the former elicit a LAN, the latter elicit an N400. Romero-Rivas et al. (2017)’s Italian, French and Portuguese participants pattern with Spanish native speakers in the N400 time window when world or semantic knowledge is violated. However, the two groups differ in that native speakers do not try to make sense of bad sentences any further, while learners recruit additional resources at later stages, as indicated by anterior negativities.

Nickels et al. (2013) and Nickels & Steinhauer (2018) show that learners can become sensitive to prosodic and syntactic boundaries, and to mismatches between them, and this would be a function of proficiency rather than L1 background (Nickels & Steinhauer 2018). These studies also find that learners, just like native speakers, report a closure positive shift (CPS) at boundaries4 , as well as an N400 to superfluous boundaries and a P600 for syntactic reanalysis. This latter, though, is less consistent and more centrally distributed than among native speakers.

Interfaces involving morphosyntax are particularly challenging for learners. This can be seen especially in the Nref component that, in learners, is subject to more variation and interference from other cues, such as conjunctions (Xu et al. 2019) and the speaker’s accent (Grey et al. 2019). In addition, Berthelsen et al. (2018) report that while Swedish native speakers exploit the tonal information of the stem to predict the incoming suffix (with a PrAN in correspondence with highly predictive tones) and engage in repair for mismatching suffixes (with a P600), nonnative speakers only respond to whole word accent (with a later negativity). It must be noted, however, that their participants are not very proficient and that a trend towards more robust negativities at higher proficiency levels is observed. In fact, there is some evidence that learners can effectively acquire morphosyntactic stem tones, irrespective of their L1. Hed et al. (2019) expose non-advanced speakers with no experience with tonal languages to Swedish morphosyntactic tones during a training session. They observe an increase in the native-like PrAN at tone onset from test session 1 to test session 2, and a LAN at mismatching suffixes at session 2.

# 3.2.2. Which factors impact acquisition the most?

3.2.2.1. Proficiency. The vast majority of the experiments aims to find the neural correlates of L2 proficiency. This conclusion can be reached in several ways, the most common being to correlate variously obtained proficiency scores with experimental measures in a cross-sectional design. Another, though less frequent, approach is to test participants in one single session after training or instruction without recording any physiological measures before administering the treatment. An even rarer method is to monitor EEG signals and behavioral performance in multiple sessions over a time span in a longitudinal study. This last choice, while very demanding, can give extremely revealing results since participants can act as their own controls. Since all authors recognize that proficiency plays a major role, it is more interesting to focus on those studies that explore the influence of other factors which can modulate the effect of proficiency.

3.2.2.2. AO. Although all experiments factorize AO in the screening phase, only a few – two in this sample – test its role in language acquisition. Díaz et al. (2016) restrict AO influence to the features shared between the L1 and the L2, as neither their learners nor their very early Spanish-Basque bilingual controls behave in a native-like fashion in processing ergative case and object-verb agreement in Basque. Fromont et al. (2020) exclude any AO effect that is independent of proficiency and exposure. However, ours is perhaps not the most suitable pool of articles to address the contribution of AO in SLA, since we focused on late learners. In fact, some papers that we excluded because they concern immigrant populations and/or participants with too low AOs argue for AO to be a significant predictor of ultimate attainment (Nichols & Joanisse 2019; Meulman et al. 2015; Tanner et al. 2014).

3.2.2.3. Language similarity. Twelve studies investigate language similarity effects. Two studies in our sample maintain that L1 background overrides proficiency effects. Xue et al. (2014) observe that Mandarin speakers process English temporal metaphors as if they were spatial expressions because, in their L1, these expressions are closely intertwined. Thus, when tested in their L1, they report a P2, an N400, and a P600 to both temporal and spatial violations, while when tested in the L2, they exhibit a P2 and an N400 (but no P600) in the spatial condition only. As for morphosyntax, Díaz et al. (2016) observe that Spanish-Basque bilinguals cannot process in a native-like way features absent in their L1, no matter how early they started acquiring the L2: instead of a (LAN)-P600, they show an N400 in object-verb agreement violations and an N400 followed by a late negativity in ergative case violations. Both Xue et al. (2014) and Díaz et al. (2016) acknowledge that the complete acquisition of features shared by the L1 is a function of proficiency, as advanced learners present a native-like P600 in subjectverb agreement violations.

Most experiments support an interaction between language distance and proficiency: the closer the L1 is to the L2, the sooner learners will master the new language. In Dowens et al. (2010), English learners of French are more sensitive (stronger LAN-P600) to number than gender agreement, while in Foucart & Frenck-Mestre (2012) they cannot detect gender agreement violations between nouns and predicative adjectives, as shown by the null ERP effects. Chang & Wang (2016) report more native-like processing—in terms of a more pronounced N400—for ungrammatical English passive sentences if they are literal translations from Mandarin. When we turn our attention to typologically similar languages, facilitative transfer seems to occur selectively. For instance, learners are more sensitive to gender agreement violations—as indicated by stronger P600 values—when they involve nouns that have common gender in the two languages (Mickan & Lemhöfer 2020, for German-Dutch; Carrasco-Ortíz et al. 2017, for Spanish-French). When learners with different L1s are directly contrasted, similar patterns are observed. In Andersson et al. (2019), German speakers, whose L1 is a V2 language, are better than English speakers when tested on Swedish V2 word order in that, along with P600 (also observed in the English group), they show a slightly right-lateralized anterior negativity. Nonetheless, their performance is a function of proficiency. Interestingly, White et al. (2012), investigating the acquisition of English tense inflection before and after training, find no advantage for Korean over Mandarin speakers in the quality of the component—a P600 in both groups —but rather in latency, which is delayed in the Mandarin group. Other authors rule out any L1 influence and explain their results uniquely in terms of proficiency (Nickels & Steinhauer 2018; Alemán Bañón et al. 2014; Gabriele et al. 2013). Nickels & Steinhauer (2018) compare German and Mandarin learners on the acquisition of prosodic-syntactic boundaries in English and find no substantial differences once proficiency is controlled for: both groups display a native-like closure positive shift at all boundaries and an N400-P600 garden path effect, despite the latter being more evident in the German than in the Mandarin group. The same is observed by Alemán Bañón et al. (2014) and Gabriele et al. (2013), who contrast English learners of Spanish at low, intermediate, and advanced proficiency levels on gender agreement, not shared with either L1: high-proficiency learners show a $\mathrm { P 6 0 0 }$ in both gender and number agreement violations; intermediate-proficiency learners only show it in number violations; low-proficiency learners do not show it at all.

3.2.2.4. Context of acquisition. In our survey, learners are mainly classroom instructed either with or without any immersion experience. If we read through the responses obtained from these two categories of participants in across all the studies, we could hardly spot any substantial difference. However, such a comparison might be rash because we cannot control for group specific characteristics that go beyond the context of acquisition. Rather, it would be advisable to devote our attention to the five studies in our sample that are designed to explore this specific matter.

An outstanding issue concerns the opposition between implicit and explicit learning. As described in the introduction, the procedural and declarative memory systems, respectively, are believed to support these functions (Ullman 2016). According to the Redundancy Hypothesis, these two systems can acquire the same contents, albeit in a qualitatively different form, and the redundant information remains available even when one of the two systems has overcome the other in a given task or function (Ullman 2016). With respect to SLA, learners at initial stages of acquisition would rely more on the declarative system, thus showing an N400 for both semantic and (morpho)syntactic violations, but veer towards a native-like N400-P600 pattern as proficiency increases. Consequently, a context favoring implicit learning (as opposed to explicit learning) should accelerate this shift. MorganShort et al. (2012a, 2012b, 2010) and Faretta-Stutenberg et al. (2018) test this hypothesis. MorganShort et al. (2012a, 2012b, 2010) train their participants on an artificial language called Brocanto2. One group is simply exposed to the language via an online chess game, the other is also taught grammatical rules. When tested on Brocanto2 gender agreement, high-proficiency learners from both groups react to determiner-noun gender agreement violations showing a P600, but only low-proficiency learners from the implicitly trained group show sensitivity—in the form of an N400—to such violations. Data on word order violations are perhaps even more compelling. Again, at low proficiency, only the implicit group detects word order violations (N400). At high proficiency, both groups display a P600, but they diverge in earlier components, which are a right anterior positivity for the explicitly trained subjects and an anterior negativity for the implicitly trained subjects. When tested again after not being exposed to the target language for a few months, the implicitly trained group shows a stronger $\mathrm { P 6 0 0 }$ that is accompanied a LAN followed by a sustained negativity, which were absent in the previous session. As for the explicitly trained group, a more robust P600 and long-lasting anterior negativities, instead of nonnative-like early positivities, are reported.

Faretta-Stutenberg et al. (2018) compare subjects who learned the TL through immersion with subjects who learned the TL at school in their home country on word order violations. While the two samples perform similarly at follow-up, only the former shows a P600 (even though with a slightly anterior distribution) already at baseline. Furthermore, this study takes individual brain profiles into consideration, demonstrating that some subjects are more positivity-oriented and others more negativity-oriented (more on this in the following section). These findings give some support to the DPM. First, at lower proficiency levels, participants recurrently show N400-like negativities for syntactic violations, while later on, in response to the same phenomena, a P600 is more frequently observed; second, this shift from negativities to the P600 is somehow boosted under implicit training conditions.

By contrast, in Batterink & Neville (2013), who train their subjects on a Mini-French language, successful and rule-aware learners from both the implicitly and explicitly trained groups display a P600 as a reaction to grammatical violations. It should be noted, however, that, unlike Morgan-Short et al. (2012a, 2012b, 2010) and Faretta-Stutenberg et al. (2018), this is not a longitudinal study, so we do not know whether the two groups follow two different developmental trajectories, despite reaching the same endpoint. Other studies give some insight on the role played by training methods. Deng et al. (2015) and Deng & Cheng (2019) claim that structure-specific input can lead to structure-specific proficiency, which is independent of global proficiency even for English subject-verb agreement, which for L1-Chinese learners is relatively hard to acquire. Citron et al. (2011) report that a long uninterrupted training period is more beneficial than multiple shorter sessions interspersed with breaks to the acquisition of verb subcategorization in Mini-Italian. Whereas in the case of subjects exposed to multiple sessions only an N400 is recorded, in the case of learners trained in one continuous session, also a P600 appears.

3.2.2.5. Individual differences. Seven studies analyze and appeal to individual differences to account for their results. A long-standing issue in SLA pertains to the precise characterization of bilinguals and monolinguals. Our survey cannot add much to this debate, since in our sample there is only one study (Grey et al. 2018) that contrasts these two categories of learners presented with a novel artificial language. Rather, this study belongs to another body of research—not represented in our sample— which investigates lexicon organization and lexical retrieval by bilinguals and monolinguals via picture naming, semantic categorization, lexical decision, and word recognition tasks. Grey et al. (2018) trains bilinguals and monolinguals on Brocanto2, and while in the second testing session, they observe a P600 in both groups (accompanied by an additional early positivity only in monolinguals), in the first testing session, they only observe it in the bilingual group.

Working Memory (WM). Many authors maintain that working memory capacity correlates with syntactic processing ability and L2 learning. An efficient WM would be key to phonological decoding, which underlies the acquisition of vocabulary, and to processing of (long-distance) dependencies between constituents. Comprehension and production of an additional language are generally thought to tax WM resources, as indicated by late anterior negativities. Despite this putative role, only six studies include participants’ WM scores in analysis (Fromont et al. 2020; Zheng & Lemhöfer 2019; Faretta-Stutenberg & Morgan-Short 2018; Kaan et al. 2016; Elgort et al. 2015; Dallas et al. 2013). Among those, only Fromont et al. (2020) single out WM as one of the explaining factors independent of daily usage and proficiency. WM correlate with the N400 specific to semantic violations and a sustained negativity in both syntactic category and semantic violations.

Individual neural profiles. In recent years some authors have questioned the homogeneity of neural profiles, suggesting that the same processes might elicit a negativity in some people and a positivity in others. In our sample, three studies focus on this matter. They all find evidence of individual variability, though with some distinctions. On the one hand, Tanner et al. (2013), who target subject-verb agreement in L1-Mandarin learners of English, detect such variability among lowproficiency subjects—who display either an N400 or P600—but not among advanced L2ers and native speakers, who only report a robust P600. On the other hand, Qi et al. (2017) observe that the relative strength of N400 and P600 detected when participants are tested in their L1 on semantic and syntactic violations, respectively, predict the amplitude of these components when the L2 is tested. Furthermore, in Faretta-Stutenberg & Morgan-Short (2018), the effect of participants’ individual neural profiles is visible at both low and higher proficiency levels in both classroom and immersion learning contexts.

# 3.2.3. How are these factors weighed?

Although the present review does not specifically deal with statistical methods, we will underscore some aspects relative to factor evaluation. In recent years, the statistical toolkit used in psychological and linguistic studies has been considerably enriched. However, when we look at our sample, we notice that most studies employ traditional methods, such as ANOVA. ANOVA allows to compare the means of different groups, but cannot integrate both random and fixed effects into the analysis. Individual characteristics—both subject-specific and item-specific—have become increasingly relevant to SLA research. More refined models allow us to treat them as continuous variables, thus obtaining more nuanced results, rather than forcing us to split participants or stimuli into clear-cut categories. Linear mixed models are a flexible alternative or complement to ANOVA, as they can cope with random and fixed factors that are either dependent on or independent of each other (Baayen 2012; Baayen et al. 2008). They are added as “adjustments” to the simplest linear equation, thus enhancing model fitness because they can account for a greater amount of variance in the dataset.

Other models have a much more articulated structure. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs, Wood 2017), for instance, comprise smoothing parameters that approximate the data even further, thus allowing for non-linear relationships between variables. Thanks to GAMs, Meulman et al. (2015) find a continuous AO effect on neural responses, while ANOVA indicates a spurious discontinuity between early learners $( { \mathrm { A O } } < 1 7 )$ ), who are native-like, and late learners $\left( \mathrm { A O } > 1 7 \right)$ ), who are not. Fromont et al. (2020) propose something even more refined when they introduce “Random Forests,” a machine learning algorithm, into neurolinguistic research. In their model, factor analysis takes the form of a decision tree in which the weight of each contributor is recomputed over N iterations for each (sub) category of dependent variables.

# 3.3 Inferential statistics

# 3.3.1. Native speakers

We considered the following factors of interest: TLEVEL, TASK, TLGEN, L1GEN. We fitted the five models reported below:

$\mathrm { \ m } 1 < .$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~TLEVEL $^ +$ TASK $^ +$ TITLE $^ +$ TLGEN $^ +$ L1GEN, data $\equiv$ pap)   
$\mathrm { m } 2 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~TLEVEL $^ +$ TASK $^ +$ TITLE, data $\equiv$ pap)   
$\mathbf { m } 3 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~TLEVEL $^ +$ TASK, data pap)   
$\mathrm { m } 4 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~TLEVEL $^ +$ TITLE, data $\equiv$ pap)   
$\mathrm { m } 5 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~TLEVEL, data $\equiv$ pap)

Pairwise comparisons via the function ANOVA reveals that $\mathtt { m } 5$ is the best model (Residual Deviance $= 1 9 1 . 8 2 8 5$ ; AIC:251.8285) where TLEVEL is highly significant (LR Chisq $= 7 5 . 1 7$ ; $\mathrm { D f } = 2 4$ ; Pr $( > \mathrm { C h i s q } ) = \mathrm { p } { < } 0 . 0 0 0 1 \rangle$ ). We included TASK, although it is very unevenly distributed, and TITLE to see whether the same study was the source of multiple datapoints. Neither factor was significant. We plot the TLEVEL effect below (Figure 6).

We further explored the data in search of significant contrasts. LAN is more likely for morphosyntax than pragmatics and semantics. N400 is more likely for semantics and interface than morphosyntax. P600 is more likely for morphosyntax than interface, pragmatics, and semantics, for syntax than pragmatics, and for interface than pragmatics.

We then ran the following models replacing TLEVEL with TFEAT employing a subset of the original dataset that only included the best represented levels of TFEAT, namely, gender agreement, number agreement, verb agreement, word order, and semantic consistency.

![](img/245701a2ca436a0a121b08288c3722f9d4e5d442bc258845ab392166a295354c.jpg)  
Figure 6. Plot of the TLEVEL effect in native speakers.

Using ANOVA, because neither of the two terms had a main effect in m1, we selected $\mathrm { m } 2$ (Residual Deviance $= 1 3 1 . 2 9 9 9$ ; AIC: 171.2999), where TFEAT was significant (LR Chisq $= 2 7 . 8 9 $ ; Df $= 1 6$ ; $\mathrm { P r } ( \mathord { > } \mathrm { C h i s q } ) = \mathrm { p } = 0 . 0 3 2 5 9 ,$ ). The effect is plotted in Figure 7. Contrasts indicate that the N400 is more likely for semantic consistency than gender, number, and verb agreement, while the $\mathrm { P 6 0 0 }$ is more likely for gender agreement (and, marginally, for verb-agreement too) than for semantic consistency.

# 3.3.2. L2 learners

We considered seven factors of interest: PROFICIENCY, TLEVEL, TASK, TITLE, TLGEN, L1GEN, GENCON, and KACQ. Missing data for proficiency were removed before fitting the following four models.

$\mathrm { m } 1 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~PROFICIENCY $+$ TLEVEL $^ +$ TASK $^ +$ TITLE $+$ TLGEN+L1GEN+ GENCON $\dot { + }$ KACQ, data $\equiv$ pap1) $\mathrm { m } 2 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~PROFICIENCY $\mathrm { \dot { + } }$ TLEVEL $^ +$ TITLE, data pap1) $\mathbf { m } 3 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~PROFICIENCY $\mathrm { \dot { + } }$ TLEVEL, data pap1) $\mathrm { m } 4 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~PROFICIENCY $\mathrm { \dot { + } }$ TITLE, data=pap1)

Results from ANOVA selected $\mathbf { m } 3$ (Residual Deviance $= 6 2 5 . 7 2 1 8$ ; AIC: 723.7218) as the best model with PROFICIENCY (LR Chisq $= 3 3 . 0 8 2 $ ; $\mathrm { D f } = 1 4$ ; $\operatorname* { P r } ( \mathrm { > C h i s q } ) = \mathfrak { p } = 0 . 0 0 2 8 0 4 )$ and TLEVEL (LR Chisq $= 1 3 8 . 5 9 2$ $\mathrm { D f } = 2 8$ ; $\operatorname* { P r } ( { \mathrm { > C h i s q } } ) = \operatorname { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 0 1 .$ ) as main effects. We also checked for a PROFICIENCYxTLEVEL interaction, but it did not prove significant.

We plot them in Figure 8. We then performed pairwise comparisons for such factors. With respect to PROFICIENCY, ANEG and LPOS are more likely at intermediate and low than high proficiency levels, and the P600 is more likely at high and intermediate than low proficiency levels.

Regarding TLEVEL, significant contrasts suggest that the ANEG is more likely for interface and pragmatics than morphosyntax, semantics, and syntax; the LAN is more likely for interface and morphosyntax than semantics and pragmatics; the LPOS is more likely for pragmatics than all other levels; the N400 is more likely for semantics than all other levels, and least likely for pragmatics in all contrasts; the null component is more likely for morphosyntax than interface and pragmatics; the

Figure 9. Plot of the TFEAT and PROFICIENCY effects in learners.

P600 is more likely for morphosyntax than interface, pragmatics, and—marginally—semantics, for syntax than pragmatics and interface, and least likely for pragmatics in all contrasts.

Afterward, we conducted analyses including TFEAT instead of the more generic TLEVEL, fitting the following models:

# m1 $<$ -multinom(COMPONENT $\sim$ PROFICIENCY $^ +$ TFEAT $^ +$ TASK $^ +$ TITLE $^ +$ TLGEN $^ +$ L1GEN+

GENCON $^ +$ KACQ, data papfeat) $\mathrm { m } 2 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~PROFICIENCY $+$ TFEAT $^ +$ TITLE, data $\equiv$ papfeat) $\mathbf { m } 3 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~PROFICIENCY\*TFEAT, data papfeat) $\mathrm { m } 4 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~PROFICIENCY $\dotplus$ TFEAT, data $\equiv$ papfeat) $\mathrm { m } 5 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~PROFICIENCY $\mathrm { \dot { + } }$ TITLE, data $\equiv$ papfeat) $\mathrm { m } 6 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~PROFICIENCY, data $\equiv$ papfeat)

ANOVA shows that neither the effect of TITLE nor the interaction between PROFICIENCY and TFEAT is significant. ANOVA comparisons show that $\mathrm { m } 4$ is the best model (Residual Deviance $=$ 328.9377; AIC: 412.9377), where TFEAT is a more influential predictor (LR Chisq $= 5 9 . 0 4 9 $ ; $\mathrm { D f } = 2 4$ ; $\operatorname* { P r } ( > \mathrm { C h i s q } ) = \mathfrak { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ than PROFICIENCY (LR Chisq $= 2 6 . 4 3 5$ ; $\mathrm { D f } = 1 2$ ; $\operatorname* { P r } ( < \mathbf { C } \mathrm { h i s q } ) = \mathfrak { p } =$ 0.009309). The effects are visualized in Figure 9. PROFICIENCY contrasts reveal that the null component is more likely at low than high proficiency levels, and the P600 is more likely at high than low proficiency levels. With respect to TFEAT, the N400 is more likely with semantic consistency than with gender and number agreement and word order, whereas the P600 is more likely with number agreement than gender agreement and semantic consistency.

# 3.3.3. Native speakers & L2 learners

We merged together learners’ and native speakers’ data from studies that originally feature the nativenonnative contrast. In this case, PROFICIENCY beside the usual “high”, “intermediate,” “low” levels, took the additional “native speaker” level. We fitted the following five models:

$\mathrm { m } 1 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~PROFICIENCY $\dotplus$ TLEVEL $^ +$ TITLE, data $\equiv$ pap1) $\mathrm { m } 2 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~PROFICIENCY $+$ TLEVEL, data pap1) $\mathbf { m } 3 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~PROFICIENCY $+$ TITLE, data $\equiv$ pap1) $\mathrm { m } 4 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~PROFICIENCY, data pap1) $\mathrm { m } 5 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~TLEVEL, data $\equiv$ pap1)

ANOVA shows that TITLE is never significant except for $\mathtt { m } 3$ , but $\mathrm { m } 2$ (Figure 10) still proves the best model (Residual Deviance $= 4 8 2 . 6 5 1 8$ ; AIC: 594.6518), with PROFICIENCY (LR Chisq $= 4 7 . 7 4 2$ ; $\mathrm { D f = }$ 21) and TLEVEL (LR C $\mathrm { h i s q } = 1 3 6 . 4 2 7$ ; $\mathrm { D f } = 2 8$ ) resulting highly significant $( \mathrm { P r } ( > \mathrm { C h i s q } ) = \mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ . Proficiency contrasts show that the LAN is more likely in native speakers than low-proficiency learners; the LNEG is more likely in high- than intermediate-proficiency learners; and the null component is more likely in low-proficiency learners than in native speakers. As for TLEVEL, the LAN is more likely for morphosyntax than pragmatics and semantics; the LPOS is more likely for pragmatics than all other levels; the N400 is more likely for semantics than morphosyntax, pragmatics, and syntax, and for interface than pragmatics; and the P600 is more likely for morphosyntax than semantics, pragmatics, and interface, while it is least likely for pragmatics in all contrasts. Again, we fitted additional models including TFEAT rather than TLEVEL:

$\mathrm { m } 1 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~PROFICIENCY $+$ TFEAT $^ +$ TITLE, data $\equiv$ papfeat) $\mathrm { m } 2 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~PROFICIENCY $+$ TFEAT, data $\equiv$ papfeat) $\mathbf { m } 3 <$ -multinom(COMPONENT\~PROFICIENCY $\mathrm { \dot { + } }$ TITLE, data $\equiv$ papfeat)

ANOVA shows that TITLE is significant in m1 and $\mathbf { m } 3$ , while TFEAT is only significant in $\mathrm { m } 2$ . Nonetheless, between-model ANOVA comparisons indicate $\mathrm { m } 2$ (Residual Deviance $= 2 9 5 . 0 6 7 6$ ; AIC: 375.0676) as the best model, with both PROFICIENCY (LR Chisq $= 4 3 . 2 8 8$ ; $\mathrm { D f } = 1 5$ ; $\operatorname* { P r } ( { \mathrm { > C h i s q } } ) = \mathfrak { p } <$ 0.001) and TFEAT (LR Chisq $= 5 9 . 0 2 0 $ ; $\mathrm { D f } = 2 0$ ; $\operatorname* { P r } ( > \mathrm { C h i s q } ) = \mathtt { p } < 0 . 0 0 0 1 )$ being highly significant. The effects are showed in Figure 11. PROFICIENCY contrasts suggest that the LAN is more likely in native speakers than low-proficiency learners; the N400 is more likely in native speakers and high-proficiency learners than in intermediate learners; the null component is most likely in low-proficiency learners; the P600 is more likely in native speakers, high- and intermediate-proficiency learners than in lowproficiency learners. Regarding TFEAT, the N400 is more likely for semantic consistency than all the other target features; the null component is more likely for gender agreement than verb agreement, semantic consistency, and word order; and the P600 is more likely for verb agreement than semantic consistency and gender agreement.

Finally, in order to exclude the possibility that one particular study determines our results, we reran $\mathrm { m } 2$ , each time leaving out the datapoint from one of the papers in turn. None of the 26 resulting models proved significantly different from the others, as evidenced by goodness-of-fit tests between LR Chisq scores.

# 4. Discussion

In the introduction, we proposed two questions that guided and motivated our research. In the following subsections, we address them in turn based on the quantitative (both descriptive and inferential) and qualitative surveys we carried out and reported on in this paper.

# 4.1 What features can be processed in a native-like manner by adult learners?

# 4.1.1. Semantics

In line with previous reviews, we find that learners reach native-likeness in semantics earlier than in other domains, as indicated by the emergence of N400 even in low-proficiency learners when tested on semantic violations (Bowden et al. 2013). However, with more complex phenomena, like metaphors (Xue et al. 2014) and across-syntactic gap anomalies (Dallas et al. 2013), advanced learners are still found to diverge from native speakers.

# 4.1.2. Syntax

Word order phenomena seem to be more accessible to learners than long-distance dependencies. Advanced speakers may end up displaying a P600, while less proficient ones only display an N400, if anything.

# 4.1.3. Morphosyntax

Morphosyntactic violations normally elicit a P600 (frequently preceded by a LAN) in native speakers. Learners at higher levels of proficiency usually show a P600 as well, but often not preceded by a LAN, while those at lower levels of global or structure-specific proficiency might display an N400 or lack any response whatsoever. From our survey, it emerges that number agreement might be internalized by learners earlier than gender and verb agreement. Especially for the latter, intense training and practice seem to favor (near)native-like processing (Deng & Cheng 2019). Case marking posits long-lasting difficulties (see the review of Díaz et al. 2016 in Section 3.2.2.3), but we should be careful on this point since such phenomenon is underrepresented in our sample. According to the studies reviewed, besides proficiency, language distance particularly affects morphosyntax acquisition (Dowens et al. 2010; Morgan-Short et al. 2010; but see Foucart & Frenck-Mestre 2012, 2011 for a different perspective), as we discuss in Section 4.2.3.

# 4.1.4. Interface phenomena

As previously mentioned, interfaces do not receive much attention in other reviews. In our collection, we find varied and sparse cases, so it is hard to outline a coherent picture. Nonetheless, it seems safe to conclude that interfaces involving (morpho)syntax are the most challenging for L2 learners, who generally find it hard to integrate multiple cues and tend to rely more on situational than structural ones. Learners prove similar to native speakers in detecting syntax-prosody mismatches, and display a closure positive shift at all prosodic boundaries as well as an N400-P600 garden-path effect after wrong boundaries (Nickels & Steinhauer 2018; Nickels et al. 2013). They also show a tendency toward nativelikeness with respect to the PrAN component in response to morphosyntactic tones (Hed et al. 2019), as well as in cases of anaphora resolution, where their responses are qualitatively similar to those of native speakers (a negativity called “Nref,” Xu et al. 2019; Grey et al. 2019). Learners’ reactions to tonal cues, however, are not native-like and only show an anterior negativity, while native speakers report an N400-anterior negativity-P600 pattern (Berthelsen et al. 2018). Even when tested on information structure (Reichle & Birdsong 2014), learners show a positive shift which is followed by an N400, whereas for native speakers, it is followed by a LAN.

The fact that learners find it hard to take in multiple pieces of information at one time inspired some researchers to investigate anticipatory mechanisms, which are crucial in native processing. Native speakers may be better able to integrate several cues because they do not deal with them all at once, but rather they start processing the elements of an utterance even before actually hearing or reading them. We cannot elaborate much further on this topic since it is only addressed by a few studies (Martin et al. 2013, Foucart et al. 2014, and Berthelsen et al. 2018), which also yield mixed results. Predictive (lexical) processing in the L1 has been linked to the N400, which is elicited by any word and reduced to expected ones, as well as to the P600 and late frontal positivities, which have been interpreted as anomaly resolution and cognitive costs, respectively (Van Petten & Luka 2012). Kaan et al. (2016), when reviewing L2 studies on predictive processing, claim that there are no reasons to believe that learners are qualitatively different from native speakers in this respect. In fact, the efficiency of this mechanism depends on the same conditions in both populations, namely, (i) the frequency information stored, (ii) competing information, (iii) the accuracy and consistency of the lexical information retrieved, (iv) task-induced processes and strategies, and (v) other factors such as motivation, resources, and cognitive control.

# 4.1.5. Summary

Out of 61 papers, only one concludes that learners cannot process a feature like native speakers. Díaz et al. (2016) find that, irrespective of AO and proficiency, learners show a late anterior negativity to ergative case marking violations rather than the P600 typical of native speakers. It should be noted that among the studies surveyed, Díaz et al. (2016) is the only one that targets case marking; therefore, this linguistic aspect deserves further investigation. Apart from this unique instance, the literature we examine supports the accounts predicting that nativelikeness can be attained by L2ers.

# 4.2 What is the impact of each predictor of L2 attainment?

# 4.2.1 Proficiency

Our survey confirms what is stated in previous ERP reviews: learners’ proficiency is undoubtedly the primary modulating factor of ERP components. Advanced learners, compared to less proficient learners, are more similar to native speakers with respect to their neural responses. This fact can be discussed in the light of various models that take into account the electrophysiological markers of L2 learners’ developing competence (e.g., the Declarative-Procedural Model, the Convergence Hypothesis, among others).

# 4.2.2 AO

AO is factorized in almost every study but none of them evidences any AO effect independent of proficiency. As the reader may recall, our sample is only composed of late learners and, thus, it is not suitable to address the question of whether very early bilinguals are more nativelike than late learners. However, in the only study where early bilinguals are present as controls, AO and proficiency together explained ERP results for features shared between the L1 and the L2, while for those unique to the L2, only language distance does. Additionally, similar findings are reported by Caffarra et al. (2015) who also include earlier bilinguals. Experiments using GAMs provide some evidence of a gradual effect of AO (Meulman et al. 2015), but further investigation is needed to disentangle it from that of proficiency, as noted in previews reviews (Steinhauer 2014; Van Hell & Tokowicz 2010; Steinhauer et al. 2009).

# 4.2.3 Language similarity

Caffarra et al. (2015) in their empirical review find no significant effect of L1-L2 similarity on participants’ responses. The experiments that explicitly test this factor in our sample yield mixed results. Apart from Díaz et al. (2016), none deems language distance to determine whether a trait is acquirable or not. As already pointed out in Morgan-Short (2014), language distance has a complex modulatory effect. In particular, facilitative transfer occurs only when features are not only shared between the L1 and the L2 but also realized in the same way in the two languages, otherwise they become less accessible; as for feature that are unique to the L2, they might be acquired more or less easily but they are not precluded in principle. Finally, available cognitive resources seem to play a role, as across-phrase dependencies are more taxing than local ones, which proved true for both native and nonnative speakers.

# 4.2.4 Context of acquisition

Out of the seven studies that manipulated the context of acquisition, six find that learners who spend time in immersion or receive implicit training are more likely to show native-like brain responses than those who receive classroom-based instruction or explicit training. Therefore, there seems to be a connection between implicit and immersion learning on the one side, and classroom and explicit learning, on the other. The former would be supported by procedural memory, while the latter by declarative memory. This would also imply a certain degree of isomorphism between mode of instruction and type of learning, which, however, is not guaranteed and should be cautiously assessed.

As already mentioned, since the majority of participants we survey are highly proficient and spent some time in immersion it is hard to disentangle proficiency and exposure over the whole sample.

# 4.2.5 Individual differences

Individual differences have become more and more central in SLA research over the last few years. WM has been associated with language learning and processing for a long time. Recent work, however, reconsiders the role of this faculty. Reichle et al. (2016) evaluate available evidence of WM effects on language processing. They find that higher WM correlates with stronger LAN (for example, in the case of subject-verb agreement violations) but not with P600 in native speakers. In learners, on the other hand, WM modulates the processing of mid-difficulty structures (e.g., within-phrase agreement) but not that of very simple or very demanding structures. They also report the findings of one of their experiments in which WM scores measured in the L1 are better predictors of ERP responses (N400 and LAN) to both languages than those measured in the L2. In our sample, among the six studies that factorize WM, only Fromont et al. (2020) find it to predict a semantic N400 as well as a late anterior negativity in response to both categorial and semantic violations. More convincing, albeit limited, is the evidence that brain profiles are subject to inter-individual variability. Among the studies we survey, three treat this matter (Faretta-Stutenberg & Morgan-Short 2018; Qi et al. 2017; Tanner et al. 2014) and record either a P600 or an N400 in the same group of participants presented with the same phenomenon. Tanner et al. (2014) introduce the response magnitude index and the response dominance index to capture the tendential strength and polarity of the components elicited by the individuals. They link the N400-dominant index to declarative memory-based and good-enough processing strategies, and the P600-dominant one to deeper and procedural processing. Note that such variability is present in native speakers as well, and may predict selective learning abilities in the L2 (Qi et al. 2017).

# 4.2.6 Summary

With respect to our second research question, there is convincing evidence that proficiency is the main predictor of ERP components, while language similarity, context of acquisition and individual differences (in particular neural profiles) seem to have a modulatory effect. The contribution of AO cannot be evaluated based on the present sample. Inferential analyses which consider native and L2 speakers together partially confirm the conclusions drawn from the qualitative survey. The MLR shows that target linguistic features and proficiency are the only significant predictors of the ERP components, while fails to find any effect of task, languages (L1 and L2), and language similarity (this last finding is also reported by Caffarra et al. 2015). Robustness of collinearity between proficiency, target features, and ERP might support the view that brainwaves can be taken as reliable signatures of learners’ developing L2 competence as far as certain language domains are concerned. As for proficiency effects, our analysis suggests that: (1) the LAN is more likely to be present in native speakers than in low-proficiency learners, but no difference is found between native speakers and high-proficiency learners; (2) the N400 is more likely to be detected in native speakers and advanced L2 learners than in low- and intermediate-proficiency learners; (3) the P600 more likely occurs in native speakers and learners at high and intermediate proficiency levels than in beginners. With respect to the role played by target features, we observed that (1) the N400 is strongly linked to violations of semantic consistency; (2) a null effect is more likely when gender agreement is involved rather than verb agreement, word order, and semantic consistency anomalies; (3) the P600 is more often elicited when verb agreement rather than semantic consistency or gender agreement violations are encountered. Our model does not detect any significant interaction between the target feature (e.g., verb agreement vs. semantic consistency) and learners’ proficiency (e.g., advanced vs. beginning levels). However, this finding is controversial since in many studies (e.g., Osterhout et al. 2008), a strong correlation is found between proficiency, type of violation (e.g., syntax vs. semantics), and ERP components (e.g., P600 vs. N400). In conclusion, the present analysis supports convergence accounts of L2 acquisition (Steinhauer et al. 2009) and confirms that N400 and P600 are the most robust components across native speakers and learners, while LAN is subject to considerable variability (see Caffarra et al. 2019; Tanner et al. 2014, for critical discussion). We cannot definitively affirm that some features are easier to acquire than others as the

PROFICIENCYxTFEAT interaction never proved significant. However, null effects in learners are especially associated with gender agreement.

# 4.3 Current methods in ERP SLA research: An overview and some remarks

# 4.3.1. Contrasts

In our sample, most studies involve a group contrast, with the native-nonnative comparison being dominant. Native speakers are held to offer a baseline to evaluate how advanced learners are. Variability among learners in relation to L1 background, proficiency, and AO is less frequently assessed by recruiting multiple groups. Proficiency and AO are often treated as continuous variables and statistically incorporated. Nativeness, on the other hand, is categorical in nature and, for this reason, it is typically used as a grouping factor. Even though a few studies recruit subjects with different mother tongues, the topic of language similarity is nonetheless present in the sample. This is because some—such as Foucart & Frenck-Mestre (2011, 2012)—code L1 similarity feature-by-feature, so that the relevant comparisons are between traits of the same language that are more or less similar to the L2.

# 4.3.2. Participants and stimuli

Standard deviations (as reported in Section 3.3) show that while the number of participants is quite homogeneous, the number of stimuli displays higher variability. This is hardly attributable to variability in the types of stimuli since we only surveyed studies that employ full sentences. Further, the majority of them administer the same task – an AJT- in the same modality, that is, visual.

# 4.3.3. Languages

As for languages, we find two distinct patterns: (1) a genus contrast between the L1 and the L2 is present in over $7 5 \%$ of the studies; (2) $9 0 \%$ of the L2s and $8 0 \%$ of the L1s investigated belong to the Indo-European family, with English being the single most frequently tested language. These impressive data can be only partially accounted for by the distribution of the L2s over the world. According to official reports (Eurostat $1 \dot { 3 } 8 / 2 0 1 3 ^ { 5 } )$ ), in 2011, English was the most studied L2 in Europe (and also China), and the majority of European students chose German, French, Spanish, or Italian as an additional language. In 2016, those language ranked at top positions in the U.S. as well (source: Modern Language Association $2 0 1 9 ^ { 6 }$ ). In recent years, however, many other languages (e.g., Russian, Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, etc.) have become increasingly popular in secondary education in Western countries, and yet they have been largely neglected by SLA ERP research. Despite critical advances in this field, we are still unable to factor out language specificity in the functional interpretation of ERP components. We are mainly aware of the effects observed in subjects from various L1 when tested in their L2 English, but we are still left to wonder what elicits a LAN, an N400, etc. in learners of Russian, Chinese, or Italian. We do not know whether our knowledge about ERP components would still hold if more varied L1-L2 pairs were taken into account.

# 4.3.4. Pre-screening measures

Generally, proficiency is measured through at least one objective test. However, almost one-fourth of the studies reviewed only employ questionnaires and self-assessment. Furthermore, among the tests, only half are standardized, while the others are designed by the experimenters or are derived from experimental measures, such as behavioral scores. Such inconsistency raises the issue of reliability and comparability between results (Rastelli 2018; Van Hell & Tokowicz 2010). Proficiency is the most investigated factor in SLA and ERP studies primarily look for its neural correlates. This might be arguable in many respects, primarily because there seems to be variability in individual brain profiles (Tanner & Van Hell 2014), and, indeed, some scholars have started taking this source of variability into account. Cross-study inconsistency in factorizing proficiency, though, is far less discussed in the field. Another related issue is the very construct of proficiency, which has long been conceived as global competence in a language. Some scholars, like Steinhauer (2014) and Steinhauer et al. (2009), have argued that we should narrow down the notion of proficiency to structure-specific proficiency, at least for the purpose of empirical investigation. In this view, structure-specific proficiency and global proficiency are partially independent of each other, that is, a learner may well be classified as high proficient even without mastering certain constructions, or vice versa. As for other predictors of acquisition, while almost all studies include AO in their analyses, less than $2 0 \%$ take WM scores and indexes of brain profiles into consideration. As a consequence, our ability to evaluate their relative contribution is severely limited.

# 4.3.5. Design and paradigm

Over the years, reviewers have noted that studies featuring cross-sectional design and violation paradigms are by far the most frequent and they could be substituted by (or at the least complemented with) more ecological designs that monitor development over time through, for example, passive reading or listening (Caffarra et al. 2015; Morgan-Short 2014). Despite such recommendations, we report that AJTs are employed in nearly $7 0 \%$ of the experiments and that less than $2 0 \%$ administer the stimuli auditorily. It is, therefore, reasonable to wonder whether different tasks and presentation modalities would yield different outcomes. A good way for testing this would be to directly contrast tasks and modalities. In our survey, the only authors who do so (Lemhöfer et al. 2020) observe that the same stimuli elicit a P600 when subjects perform the AJT, but do not when they perform the reading task. The task-dependency of this component has already been acknowledged by Brouwer & Crocker (2017) and Brouwer et al. (2012). As for the presentation modality, it might play a role in learners’ (but not in native speakers’) processing, as listening tasks are deemed to be particularly challenging for this population (Fernandez et al. 2019).

With respect to design, only a minority of experiments are longitudinal, which means that most studies are not interested in accounting for the trajectory of the acquisition process. We believe that since SLA models are explicitly crafted to predict such trajectories, it should be a priority for empirical research to test their hypotheses as directly as possible. A valuable way to do so is represented by artificial language paradigms (Steihauer 2014; Steinhauer et al. 2009), which have proven to offer significant advantages over natural languages while giving equally reliable results (Morgan-Short 2020; Grey 2020).

# 4.3.6. Statistical methods

A final remark concerns statistical methods. Although it is beyond the scope of the present review to assess the appropriateness of the techniques used in research, we highlight a couple of facts. A qualitative inspection of the sample reveals that most studies opted for ANOVA, while only a handful employed mixed-effect models. Several methodological papers in recent years have encouraged the adoption of mixed (or more complex) models because they offer several advantages over ANOVA (Plonsky et al. 2018, 2017; Plonsky 2013). Compared to traditional methods, state-of-the-art models can identify more articulated patterns in the data structure, as observed by Meulman et al. (2015) and Fromont et al. (2020), who employ GAMs and Random Forests, respectively. It might be good practice to perform analyses with multiple methods. This would be a way to cross-validate the results while helping methodological advances in the field.

# 4.3.7. Summary

This methodological overview evidences that current research mainly (i) focuses on high proficient learners and (ii) tests morphosyntax, (iii) employs violation paradigms and (iv) visual presentation (v) in cross-sectional designs, (vi) involves Indo-European languages, (vii) takes native speakers as controls, and (viii) chooses traditional statistical approaches (e.g., ANOVA) over more recent ones (e.g., GAMs).

# 5. Limitations

We are aware that this study suffers from three major limitations:

(1) Although we screened thousands of papers, it is possible we missed some relevant records.   
(2) Since this is not a meta-analysis, we did not assess the relative reliability of each experiment, hence we cannot provide a general evaluation of research quality.   
(3) We focused our attention on sentence processing, leaving out cognitive, inhibitory, and executive control, single-word processing, code-switching, and phoneme discrimination, which are all crucial issues in bilingualism.

# 6. Conclusions and future directions

We examined 61 SLA papers that report on ERP experiments involving adult learners. Our analysis encompassed a descriptive and an inferential part.

In relation to our first research question—what features are held to be processed in a nativelike way by adult L2 learners?—we can conclude that in principle any feature can get to be processed in a nativelike way but different features may be acquired at a different pace. In particular, nativelikeness seems to be achieved earlier and more easily in the semantic domain, while syntax (especially long-distance dependencies), morphosyntax, and interfaces are less accessible to automatic processing, as signaled by the P600 components. Moreover, features that only partially overlap in the L1 and the L2 are acquired more slowly than those which are shared between the two languages or are unique to the L2. Regarding question number 2—what is the impact of proficiency, AO, language distance, context of acquisition, and individual differences on the ERP components?—our qualitative review indicates that proficiency is the most important factor, but its effect is modulated by language similarity, available cognitive resources, context of acquisition, and, possibly, individual neural profiles. However, virtually no study has argued that AO and language similarity can determine the full acquisition of a linguistic trait. Statistical analyses find that only learners’ proficiency reliably predicts the type of ERP component detected, and confirm that the N400, P600, and LAN components are associated, respectively, with semantics and (morpho)syntax.
