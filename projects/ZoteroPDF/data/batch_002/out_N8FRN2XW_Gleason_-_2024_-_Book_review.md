International Perspectives on Teaching and Learning Academic English in Turbulent Times, James Fenton, Julio Gimenez, Katherine Mansfield, Martin Percy, Mariangela Spinillo (Eds.). Routledge, New York, NY (2023). pp. i-302 Paperback, ISBN: 9781032254784

The edited volume, International Perspectives on Teaching and Learning Academic English in Turbulent Times, brings together research from across the globe to record a unique time in the history of academic English (AE) teaching, as the result of the Covid-19 pandemic. As the five volume editors: James Fenton, Julio Ginenez, Katherine Mansfield, Martin Percy, and Mariangela Spinellodall from the University of Manchester in Manchester, Englanddassert this book leaves a “legacy of the experiences and actions of colleagues working in many varied, yet similar contexts of higher education [who] teach academic English in turbulent times” (p. 5). While the immediate disruption of the Covid-19 context may have already lulled since the book’s publication, the global challenges humanity faces continue to grow and change. This manuscript marks a unique and particularly challenging point in our world’s history, while at the same time it points toward a new normal that has yet to be fully understood.

Across 27 sections (21 chapters, an introduction by the five co-editors, a lead chapter for each of the four parts written by one of the co-editors, and an afterword by one of the co-editors), the number of international voices about the educational response to the Covid-19 pandemic in AE contexts in this volume includes those from six continents and 22 countries: Africa (Qatar), Asia (China, Russia, Thailand, Uzbekistan), Europe (Albania, Belgium, Czech Republic, Czechia, Finland, Montenegro, Slovakia, Sweden, the United Kingdom), North America (Canada, the United States), Oceania (Australia, New Zealand) and South America (Argentina, Chile, Ecuador). This symphony of voices is just one of the book’s strengths, and its authors’ narratives intertwine. Each case is unique and yet somehow collectively shared by the human and more-than-human characters on the current world stage.

The first part of the book outlined by Spinillo summarizes six chapters, all of which relate to the rapid response to the Covid19 crisis and each from a different global AE context. In the first chapter, Bolster and Levrai from the University of Turku in Finland share how e-tools were implemented to address issues of teacher wellbeing and student isolation. In the second chapter, Donovan from University of Westminster in the UK examines how pre-sessional induction courses helped the development of instructor resilience, technology-informed teaching, and research-informed content. In the third chapter, Knezevic from the University Mediterranean Podgorica in Montenegro describes the insufficient support teachers from two universities received during the rapid transition to online instruction because of the pandemic, and a project to reform foreign languages in academia (ReFLAME Erasmus $+$ ), which encouraged lecturers to explore resources on their own to adapt to the crisis. In the fourth chapter, Manasreh, Raza and Sarfraz from Qatar University’s Foundational English Department used culturally-based strategies such as student training for online learning to effectively transfer traditional in-person classroom skills into a virtual learning environment. In the fifth chapter, Mezek and Kaufhold describe how the teaching of an interdisciplinary AE postgraduate course at the University of Stockholm, Sweden faced challenges by harnessing two key tools: videoconferencing and an online learning platform, and how each brought its own advantages and disadvantages. Finally, in the sixth chapter, Wette from the University of Auckland in New Zealand outlines how flipped learning was implemented in a graduate-level academic writing course in order mitigate student disinterest, passivity, and a lack of engagement in online courses.

The second part of the book focuses on adaptations made to teaching academic skills online. Mansfield outlines five chapters from different countries, and how each was able to introduce sustainable and successful innovations which continue to evolve post-pandemic. In Chapter 7, DeRoey and Skipp from the University of Luxembourg and Trier University in Germany focus on a PhD course for writing journal articles at a multilingual university in Luxembourg, focusing on design and delivery during the Covid-19 pandemic. In Chapter 8, Pereira-Rocha from Pontificia Universidad Católica in Chile describes a doctoral course which focused on research writing in STEM, and how pandemic-induced educational modifications, such as asynchronous instruction and online learning communities, were beneficial for cultivating greater flexibility and participant sense of ubiquity. In Chapter 9, Colombo homes in on post-doctoral writing workshops in Buenos Aires Argentina that took a dialogic approach, and how teacher-centered patterns had to transform into wider dialogic spaces that rely on collective decision-making. In Chapter 10, Alhasani (Dubhali) describes the different developmental literacy skills students developed during a postgraduate academic reading and writing course at EPOKA University in Albania, and their overwhelming resistance to fully online coursework. In Chapter 11, Akhmedjanova and Akhmedova from Westminster International University in Tashkent Uzbekistan describe an academic English module focused on academic reading, writing, and listening skills, later developing a roadmap for teaching AE online across the country.

In the third part introduced by Fenton, collaboration and online learning communities are the focus. In Chapter 12, Caplan describes how collaboration was utilized on an institutional level at a university in Delaware USA to reconcile new standards and strategies. In Chapter 13, Steyne and her colleagues from institutions across Europe showed how teamwork helped redesign and ultimately improve online academic writing courses for university teachers in Slovakia and Czechia. In Chapter 14, Rodas relates how online writing groups were implemented at the University of Cuenca in Ecuador to sustain and support stakeholders in their professional writing courses during the pandemic. In Chapter 15, Lennon and his colleagues take us to Masaryk University Language Center in the Czech Republic, where key virtual spaces allowed writers and presenters an opportunity to share ideas, build community, and develop their academic writing skills. In Chapter 16, Ishii describes how mostly Chinese international students participated collaboratively and actively cultivated their social presence during an undergraduate academic writing course offered at Massey University in New Zealand.

In the fourth section, Percy outlines the dramatic changes in online assessment practices that occurred because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The six chapters in this section deal with key aspects and changes that occurred across multiple contexts. In Chapter 17, Dineen from the Macquarie University Language Centre in Sydney Australia discusses how in their search towards greater community, engagement, and academic integrity, a shift occurred towards integrated skills tasks and sustainable digital assessment. Tchekpassi and Zhang in Chapter 18 highlight how two courses at the American Language Institute of Indiana University of Pennsylvania adapted their formative online assessment practices during the pandemic through teacher-student rubric co-construction and negotiated instructional policies that relied heavily on student input. In Chapter 19, Shchemeleva and Smirnova from the research-intensive HSE University in Russia illustrate how English assessment during the pandemic were impacted by broader sociopolitical, historical, and educational factors. A case study presented in Chapter 20 by Li, Jing, and Guoying from Donghua University in Shanghai China examined remote reading and writing courses, exploring how formative and summative testing practices were adjusted to ensure validity and reliability. In Chapter 21, Sitthitikul and Tuvajitt from Thamassat University and Assumption University in Thailand explore alternative assessment and collaborative learning during AE courses during the pandemic, showing how crisis contexts offer opportunities for teachers to evolve their beliefs and approaches and ultimately can lead to improvements and useful insights about how to manage future challenges.

Through the wide-reaching breadth of international voices included in this volume, the reader comes to appreciate the differences in educational processes, practices, and products evidenced during the Covid-19 pandemic. At the same time, one silver lining that this volume clearly points out is the shared human experiences that were brought to light during the unstable times humanity endured during the global pandemic. In his afterword, Gimenez reiterates the range of technological and pedagogical responses to the crisis, the creative adaptations educators needed to make to the rapid transition to online teaching, the undoubtedly necessary collaborative efforts that resulted from a need to find creative solutions to the crisis, and the opportunity that many educators had to rethink their assessment practices. Readers are left feeling a combination of both admiration for the resourcefulness, determination, and dedication of AE students and educators across the planet, as well as a sense of being better prepared for the turbulent and challenging moments certainly yet to come.

One of the real merits of this volume is the sheer number of perspectives that it brings together. However, what is wide in breath, is understandably often limited in depth. Although the diverse voices and realities shared in this volume weave together common threads and themes, readers are left with the burden of interpreting the new normal unearthed in the years following the crisis. While the innovation, resilience, and creativity of multiple authors are skillfully showcased; the volume may lack a certain degree of future-oriented direction and implications, perhaps since the chapters contained therein focus on the tempestuous conditions immediately following the crisis context rather than those which came about in the years after the dust had begun to settle. Nevertheless, the editors and authors of this volume have brought together a commendable amplitude of outlooks, circumstances, and reference frames, which will hold retrospective insight and value for years to come.
