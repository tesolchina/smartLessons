# Abstract

Studies on classroom interaction have typically focused on relationships between turn-taking patterns and some larger unit of analysis of varying length and nature. However, two questions still left unanswered are how teachers talk differently from students in general and how linguistic variation between two participants might relate to differences in discipline or level of instruction.

The present study takes a corpus-based approach to explore differences between ‘teacher talk’ and ‘student talk’ analyzing a large collection of spoken texts collected in American university classrooms. The corpus comprises 196 transcribed sessions recorded at five universities across the United States, totaling 1.4 million words.

Results indicate that students in American classrooms take more turns than teachers. However, over $80 \%$ of student turns contain fewer than 30 words at a time. When comparing linguistic differences manifested in longer turns, it is apparent that teachers use significantly more linguistic features associated with a contextual, directive orientation in Engineering, Business, and in Education, and in five of the six disciplines examined (except Engineering) students use mostly linguistic features associated with ‘personalized framing’ elements. Patterns of variation are also present across levels of instruction.

# 1. Background

Over the past three decades, most classroom interaction studies (Cazden, 2001) have been carried out in elementary school settings (e.g., cultural differences in interactional sequences by Poole, 2005) or in language classrooms (Bygate, 1988), focusing mainly on interactional patterns as they relate to larger functional units of analysis (e.g., Initiation–Response–Feedback models by Sinclair & Coulthard, 1975). These studies are invaluable as they provide us with detailed analyses of interaction in the classroom; however, large-scale investigations into patterns of language use by teachers and students are still missing. Additionally, while a number of studies have discussed student writing in academic contexts from multiple perspectives (e.g., Hyland, 2002; Johns, 1997), little attention has been given to the characterization of participants’ patterns of language use in university class sessions.

# 1.1. University classroom talk

Linguistic studies investigating academic lectures have focused on one or a few class sessions at a time to ‘‘reflect the general interest in the lexical, rhetorical, and topical structures of discourse’’ (Csomay, in press). For example, numerous studies have reported on the varying functions of individual linguistic and lexical items in lectures (e.g., lexical phrases by Nattinger & DeCarrico, 1992; idioms by Simpson & Mendis, 2003; reflexivity by Mauranen, 2001; evaluative adjectives by Swales & Burke, 2003; pronouns by Fortanet, 2004). As for the rhetorical perspective, most studies were carried out in the 90s, and reported on disciplinary differences as they relate to variation in discourse organization (e.g., Dudley-Evans, 1994; Young, 1994). After examining the topical structure of a few lectures, Hansen (1994) concluded that topic shifts can be identified most reliably through tracing those discourse markers that signal topic shifts; others have looked for discourse markers and their functional variants in a corpus of lectures (Camiciottoli Crawford, 2004). Although these studies investigate university classroom discourse from different perspectives, nearly all of them focus on lexical items and their functions, while neglecting individual grammatical features or a group of grammatical features and their functional correlates. Additionally, they mostly investigate teacher-led monologic class sessions.

In order to provide comprehensive descriptions of linguistic variation in university classrooms, computational methods and quantitative analyses are needed to carry out large-scale investigations. Corpus-based approaches to research provide this framework. They explore linguistic variation among spoken and written registers in the academic context (Biber, 2006) and have successfully described patterns of co-occurring linguistic features in university settings in general (e.g., Biber, Conrad, Reppen, Byrd, & Helt, 2002; Biber et al., 2004) and in the classroom in particular (Csomay, 2005). Supported by this methodology, other studies also show that North American university classes display linguistic features of both face-to-face conversation and written academic prose (Csomay, 2000, 2006).

Investigating class sessions further, corpus-based studies include both monologic and interactive types of classes and report on the relationship between language use and degrees of interactivity. For example, Csomay (2002) tracks varying patterns of turn taking in class sessions to identify degrees of interactivity and describes linguistic variation in classes in relation to this classification. Finally, Csomay (2005) concludes that interactive features are an integral part of the variation within class sessions.

As seen, previous corpus-based studies took a comprehensive approach to describe variation in class sessions and as such complement other analytical frameworks to classroom discourse analysis; yet they have neglected the differences in patterns of language used by the two participants in this context. Hence, missing in studies from this analytical framework to date is a large-scale investigation of variation in language use specific to the two primary participants in classroom interaction: teacher and student.

# 1.2. The goal of this study

The goal of the present study is to describe the way in which teachers and students talk in North American university classrooms, taking a corpus-based approach to the analysis. The following question guided the present investigation: How does teacher talk vary from student talk in six disciplines and in three levels of instruction as measured by the linguistic features in three feature groups identified in university classroom talk? In this study, each participant’s turn is taken as the basic unit of analysis to further identify its linguistic characteristics. This approach opens up further avenues to explore teacher talk and student talk.

# 2. Methodology

In this section, the design of the study and the analytical framework are described. Decisions were made concerning the corpus of participant talk, operational definitions of turns and their further categories, and the selection of the linguistic features in the analysis.

# 2.1. The corpus

In the initial analysis, 196 transcripts of university classroom talk were taken from two corpora (T2KSWAL1 and MICASE) with a total of about 1.4 million words. The T2KSWAL corpus (Biber, 2006; Biber et al., 2002) was collected at four universities across the United States (Biber et al., 2004), and the MICASE corpus (Simpson & Swales, 2001) was collected at the University of Michigan. All class sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed based on pre-defined transcribing conventions (Biber et al., 2004), and all texts were tagged for interactional features (turn, turn length) and for grammatical features, the latter using Biber’s grammatical tagger.

Turns in these class sessions were identified and classified based on who took the turn (teacher, student), in which discipline (Business, Education, Engineering, Humanities, Social Sciences, Natural Sciences), and at which level of instruction (Low level, Upper level, Graduate). The turn distributions are illustrated in Table 1 (by discipline) and in Table 2 (by levels of instruction).

# 2.2. Definitions

Tao’s (2003, p. 189) broad definition of a ‘turn,’ namely, ‘‘any speaker change will be treated as a new turn’’ was used in the present study to determine the basic unit of analysis. Each turn was characterized further from multiple perspectives. First, every turn was marked for who took the turn (teacher or student) and how long the turn was. Second, each turn was classified based on their lexical or non-lexical content. On the one hand, turns with lexical content included two further subcategories: turns with one word only, for example, ‘right’ or ‘good,’ and turns with two or more words (multi-word turns) such as, ‘let’s look at this exampley’ On the other hand, turns with non-lexical content were marked for transcription remarks such as ‘laughter,’ ‘unclear words’ or for vocalizations of various kind, for example ‘uh,’ or ‘mhm.’

# 2.3. Feature groups and their linguistic features

The linguistic investigation in the present study relied on the analysis of variation in university classroom talk (Csomay, 2005) and was based on the co-occurring patterns of a large number of linguistic features in that context. In this earlier work, factor analytical techniques were used to describe the dimensions of linguistic variation in university class sessions, adopting Biber’s (1988) approach to investigate variation across speech and writing. Table 3 lists the linguistic and interactional features found to co-occur on three dimensions of university classroom talk reported in Csomay (2005). A description of each dimension follows.

The first dimension (Dimension 1) is interpreted as ‘Contextual orientation’ versus ‘Conceptual, informative focus.’ The linguistic features together on the positive side of Dimension 1 are associated with context-dependent interaction or discourse, where participants make constant reference to the immediate context. The linguistic features are, for example, first and second person pronouns, modals, contractions, third person inanimate pronouns including reduced forms, activity verbs, commonly used words, and conditional clauses. These features are included in the first feature group, called ‘Contextual orientation’ in the present study. The text extract below (Extract 1) illustrates the accumulation of these features in a text segment. Positive Dimension 1 features are in bold italics.

Extract 1

Teacher : y well I’m going to say I don’t mind y you’re doing a nice job but we ought to give some of these other brilliant folks a chance. anybody want to summarize the hot stove rule for us? . . Ok. you do it. I don’t want to make anybody do it. Student: alright. page three twenty-one.

Table 3 Overall distribution of total number of turns taken by each participant   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Number of turns</td><td>% distribution</td></tr><tr><td>Teacher</td><td>11,364</td><td>44</td></tr><tr><td>Student</td><td>14,775</td><td>56</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>26,139</td><td>100</td></tr></table></body></html>

Teacher: yeah . . . . we had a I know one answer marked wrong on my crib sheet $\pmb { I }$ gave you um [xxx] so I’m going to save about six or eight minutes to review that uh so um nobody else give me a paper to correct and we’ll [xxx] at the end of the class.

In contrast, the features co-occurring on the negative side of Dimension 1 are associated with a conceptual, informational focus. The dominant features on this side of Dimension 1 are, for example, nouns, prepositional phrases, attributive adjectives. In this study, all of these features are included in the feature group called ‘Conceptual focus’. Extract 2 illustrates this side of Dimension 1. Features of this dimension are in bold.

Extract 2

Teacher: y and uh usually I stick pretty close to the text in going through the lesson somewhere along the line some people have said that helps them follow the material and notes but today there’s a lot of material in that chapter that sort of clutters it up. it’s more cluttered and worthwhile so I’m going to while an abbreviated lecture notes that I have and I will skip quite a few of those what I think are less important items in there we will have a brilliant dissertation on the hot stove rule and then we will take uh six eight minutes to talk about the case and uh which I think has some value uh with that are we about ready to go? ok. what what’s our chapter about today?

The linguistic features on the second dimension (Dimension 2) are: different types of verb controlling that-complement clauses, third person pronouns, and particular fixed expressions. As discussed in previous work, the main clause in a that-complement controlled by a verb provides framing to the proposition made in the dependent clause (Biber, 1988, p. 231). Three kinds of verbs controlling the complement clause co-occur in this dimension: mental verbs, for example, think, know, guess; factual verbs, as in mean, realize; and likelihood verbs, as in appear, hypothesize, and predict (Biber et al., 2004). Together with other features such as personal pronouns, they reflect the way in which participants frame statements as they overtly express their own personal perspectives (Csomay, in press). The co-occurrence of discourse frames (I mean and you know) in this dimension indicates that participants formulate their ideas on-line. All in all, this dimension (Dimension 2) is interpreted as ‘Personalized framing.’ Extract 3 illustrates the features apparent on this dimension. Personalized framing features are bold italics underlined.

Extract 3

Student: y Now that’s really a question. Did the uh the Soviets pull their people out? Or did the Chinese push them out? I get, I get both, I get both sides. Well, I, if you take a look at this from you know, purely pragmatic viewpoint, I mean you know, of course you can probably find evidence to both. But why would, I mean, why would, uh, China want to throw out Soviet technocrats when that was basically the only area at this point in time where they were getting the technology that they needed in order to-to advance industry at that time. And later on, yeah y

Finally, the third dimension (Dimension 3) is interpreted as reflecting ‘Interactive dialogue’ versus ‘Teacher monologue.’ One side of this dimension contains interactional features evidenced by intensive turn taking, one-word turns, and discourse particles, hence reflecting highly interactive discourse. In contrast, the other side of this dimension contains turn length features such as long teacher turns, indicating a monologic type of discourse.

Since this study investigates turn content from a grammatical perspective, the features of this particular dimension are not in the scope of the present work. They are, however, the focus of on-going research (Csomay, 2007).

For the purposes of this study, the linguistic features in the first two dimensions, especially relevant to the two participants’ talk in a classroom context, are discussed in detail. To depict detailed differences between the two participants’ talk, the linguistic features co-occurring on the two sides of Dimension 1 are discussed separately. In order to separate the linguistic groups at the two poles of this dimension, they are referred to as ‘feature groups’ in the present work. Accordingly, three groups of features are discussed in this study: (1) contextual orientation, (2) conceptual focus, and (3) personalized framing.

# 2.4. Computer programs

Multiple computer programs were developed to track the types of information needed for the further linguistic analysis. One program was designed to deal with turn identification and turn counts. It was developed to automatically identify speaker change (turns) in the transcripts, and to count the number of turns taken by each participant, and keep track of the number of words in each turn for each participant. Another program was developed to calculate proportions of turns, and to count an array of linguistic features in each participant’s turns.

# 2.5. Analytical procedures, counts, and statistical procedures

The corpus contains transcripts from classes with lecture and seminar style teaching, reflecting teacher monologues, student discussions in small groups, and dialogues between the teacher and a student. Hence, an uneven number of turns are noted for each participant. Table 3 shows the distribution of number of turns taken by each participant.

# 2.5.1. Turn length

Turn length ranged between 1 and 8000 words at a time. Table 4 illustrates the proportion of turn length taken by participants in the classroom. Earlier findings (Csomay, 2005) have shown that one-word turns are dominant in interactive discourse in classrooms; however, this fact was not indicative of who actually takes those short turns.

Notably, as Table 4 shows, only $1 . 5 \%$ of the total turns teachers take contain one word while $21 \%$ of the total turns students take in the class are this length. What the most typical words are in these short word turns, and what functions these turns would hold in a classroom dialogue is not in the scope of the present study but is discussed in work in progress (Csomay, 2007). At the same time, . $7 \%$ of the students’ talk exceeds 230 words at a time while teachers have longer stretches of talk nearly $1 0 \%$ of the time they take a turn.

Table 4 Proportion of turn length by the two participants in university classroom talk   

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2">Participant 1 word turn</td><td colspan="2"></td><td colspan="2">2-29 word turns</td><td colspan="2">30-230 word turns</td><td colspan="2">More than 230 word turns</td><td colspan="2">Total</td></tr><tr><td>Number %</td><td></td><td>Number</td><td>%</td><td>Number</td><td>%</td><td>Number</td><td>%</td><td>Number</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>Teacher</td><td>164</td><td>1.5</td><td>6390</td><td>56.2</td><td>3728</td><td>32.8</td><td>1082</td><td>9.5</td><td>11,364</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Student</td><td>3047</td><td>20.6</td><td>9921</td><td>67.1</td><td>1708</td><td>11.6</td><td>99</td><td>.7</td><td>14,775</td><td>100</td></tr></table></body></html>

In an attempt to balance these differences, and to assure that most of the student talk is accounted for, careful consideration was given to the proportion of number of turns taken by each participant and the average turn length measures: the decision was made to consider turns with at least 30 and no longer than 230 words for further, quantitative analysis.

# 2.5.2. Statistical procedures

To identify the statistically significant differences between participants in the use of the linguistic features in the three feature groups mentioned above and in the different disciplines and levels of instruction, a Factorial Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test was used. SPSS 11.5 statistical software was applied.

In order to successfully interpret the results, it is crucial to understand what this statistical procedure actually does. Conceptually, a two-way ANOVA tests the significance of the independent variables (i.e., speaker, discipline, level of instruction) as well as the interaction between them as predictor variables for the combined scores of the dependent variable (i.e., the linguistic features in the three features groups in this study). If the F score is statistically significant $( p < . 0 5 )$ for any one or two of the predictor variables in any one of the feature groups, the variation in the scores for the dependent variable can be attributed to that predictor. However, if the $\mathrm { F }$ score is high (and is statistically significant) for the two variables combined, there is strong ‘interaction’ in the effect of the two variables in influencing the change in the score. Hence, the effect of interaction between the two main effects over-rides the importance of the two main effects considered separately.

In the present study, if the interaction shows statistically significant results, our interpretation will need to reflect that, concluding that neither the discipline nor the speaker alone could account for the variation in that particular feature group. Hence, the variation in the given feature group must be attributed to the fact that teachers talk differently from students but that this variation is in interaction with the discipline and cannot be attributed to participant talk alone. In the present study, interaction between the two main variables is favorable.

# 3. Findings

As outlined before, the primary goal of the present study is to explore patterns of variation between teacher talk and student talk across six disciplines and three levels of instruction. The two sets of main effects in the present study are: (1) speaker and discipline, and (2) speaker and level of instruction. Tables 5a and b display the statistical results gained through the ANOVA tests.

As Table 5 shows, there are statistically significant differences in the way the three features groups (Contextual orientation, Conceptual focus, and Personalized framing) are used, however, with varying patterns. Both in terms of disciplines alone and level of instruction alone, the first two feature groups show statistically significant results. We might conclude that these two predictors alone are responsible for the variation of the linguistic features used on these feature groups; however, in all three features groups the interaction between the two main effects also show statistically significant results.

Because the interaction effect is statistically significant in all three feature groups, we conclude that the differences in the way the linguistic features vary must be attributed to the interaction of variable pairs together. That is, the participants’ (teacher and student) use of the various linguistic features identified in a given feature group will vary depending on which discipline we look at, and which level of instruction we investigate. However, the mere fact that there is a statistically significant difference in the way the two participants talk in these settings will fail to tell us where the differences lie. The mean scores for each feature group will tell us how close teacher talk is to student talk with regard to the particular linguistic features in a feature group and in which disciplines and which level of instruction there might be a large difference, as discussed in the subsequent sections of this paper in more detail.

Differences in teacher talk versus student talk in six disciplines are discussed first, followed by discussions of those differences across the three levels of instruction.

# 3.1. Teacher talk versus student talk in six disciplines

# 3.1.1. Contextual orientation and Conceptual focus

The mean dimension scores for ‘Contextual orientation’ differ depending on who speaks and in which discipline. As Fig. 1 shows, in Business, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences, students tend to use more linguistic features associated with context-dependent discourse. In contrast, in Education and Engineering classes the teachers use more linguistic features from this feature group.

The features clustering together on this feature group suggest that an involved type of discourse is occurring in shared space and under time duress (Biber, 1988, pp. 225–226). The participants in a classroom setting are usually in the same physical and mental space, and classroom discussions often being spontaneous spoken discourse, the participants are under time constraints as well.

Extract 4 below illustrates how the teacher uses these features in an Engineering class, while Extract 5 shows a student turn from a Natural Science class. Linguistic features of Contextual orientation (Dimension 1 positive features) are in bold italics.

(Natural Science)

In turns where these features co-occur, often references are made to objects or materials physically apparent in the classroom (e.g., if we deduct this from this, we get this), hypothetical situations are brought up or concrete connections are made (e.g., if we deduct this from this, we get this), alternative solutions are offered to a particular problem, or an action linked to the object in the shared space is called for (e.g., let’s look at the example in the book).

In Education and Engineering classes, teacher turns contain features from this group. As Extract 4 illustrates, the teacher demonstrates a software program in an Engineering class. In the other disciplines (except for Humanities) the students use more of the features associated with contextual orientation. In Extract 5, a student spontaneously expands on a previous thought making connections in mental space. The overall purpose of both turns above in Extracts 4 and 5 is ‘presentation,’ but they are different in that the teacher presents procedures on line as making connections with the physical context while the student presents his thoughts formulated spontaneously where the connections are made in a mental space. As this example shows, the linguistic features co-occurring together correspond to particular functions, but whether those turns differ in any other aspect when taken teacher or by student awaits further research.

As for ‘Conceptual focus,’ Fig. 1 also shows teachers in the Humanities are most inclined to use language (e.g., nouns, attributive adjectives, nominalizations, past tense, etc.) associated with a conceptual focus. The following text extract (Extract 6) further illustrates this. Linguistic features of Conceptual focus (Dimension 1 negative features) are in bold letters.

Teacher: Okay. All righty um what I want to do is continue with this discussion that we’ve been trying to show, between the interaction of history and, language change, and again as I state we’re using the Romance languages as sort of our test case, because we have an abundant documentation of the situation both of the historical development of the Romance languages the historical background of real world events which occurred from the start of the Roman Empire right up through the fall of the Roman Empire, and the ultimate uh fate of the various provinces of the Roman Empire, and we also have an abundant corpus of linguistic documentation. so to a large extent the Romance languages present an ideal case, uh for studying, the development of language against the background of history. or conversely how history affects language. One of the issues that I want to particularly concentrate on today is the issue of the linguistic, uh impact of language contact. y

(Humanities)

Earlier work has discussed the various functions of individual features alone. For example, previous studies reported on the academic reporting functions of past tense in written academic prose and its narrative functions in spoken discourse. Furthermore, nouns have been considered to be ‘‘the primary bearers of referential meaning in a text,’’ and attributive adjectives, embedded in noun phrases, are used to ‘‘further elaborate nominal information’’ (Biber, 1988, p. 105). Research analyzing the co-occurring patterns of these individual features concludes that the high frequency of these and other cooccurring features (e.g., nominalization) in a text indicates dense informational packaging, and is a characteristic of written discourse (Biber, 1995). Initial attempts have been made to describe the functions of the co-occurring patterns as they relate to the instructional purposes in university classroom talk (Csomay, 2005, in press), especially in the light of earlier findings on academic classrooms being an interface between oral and written discourse (Csomay, 2000, 2006). For example, the instructional purpose of the turn in Extract 6 is exposition, where the teacher provides background information first, then starts the topic of the day.

# 3.1.2. Personalized framing

The use of personalized framing features varies depending on who speaks and in which discipline. First of all, neither of the participants’ talk in Engineering classes contains many of the linguistic features of this feature group, hence the negative mean dimension scores for both teachers and students. Secondly, only in three of the six disciplines (Education, Humanities, and Social Sciences) do teachers express their thoughts with language from this group at all, leaving the remaining two disciplines (Business and Natural Sciences) with negative scores.

On the other hand, students tend to use more personalized framing features in all of the remaining five disciplines (except for Engineering, as mentioned above) but to varying degrees. As the mean dimension scores in Fig. 2 show, Business and Social Sciences students use the constellation of these features with similar intensity.

Fig. 2. Dimension 2 features by participants across disciplines.

The linguistic features in this feature group indicate the presence of on-line processing, where the thoughts, opinions, and interpretations of the material are expressed with the help of these framing elements. In contrast, the lack of these features (negative mean dimensions scores) suggests that propositions are made more concisely. The lack of personalized framing features is present mostly in teacher talk (except for Engineering). This may be due to the differences in instructional focus across disciplines. Teachers’ styles of expression vary depending on disciplines, with teachers in the ‘hard’ sciences having a different approach in expressing the proposition. Further research could describe the differences in instructional and communicative purpose of teacher turns in the ‘hard’ sciences versus others in more detail. At the same time, students are similar in ways of expressing their thoughts across other disciplines, even though with a slight variation in intensity. Since Engineering students also lack those personalized framing features, it might be interesting to examine the possible purposes of those turns in a later study. The way these patterns may change across the three levels of instruction is discussed in the next section.

# 3.2. Teacher talk versus student talk in three levels of instruction

# 3.2.1. Contextual orientation and conceptual focus

Contextual, directive orientation is the dominant characteristic feature group in all three levels of instruction. At the same time, the scores for contextual orientation differ depending on who speaks and in which level of instruction. Fig. 3 illustrates the patterns of difference.

As Fig. 3 shows, the most dramatic difference between teachers and students in using linguistic features associated with this feature group is visibly in undergraduate lowdivision classes. In upper division undergraduate classes the mean scores for students are lower than for teachers and finally, in graduate classes students use just slightly more of the contextual features than teachers. Since both participants use overwhelmingly more of the contextual features across levels, they outweigh scores for the conceptual focus (hence, no scores apparent on the left hand side of the graph with negative values).

mSystematic growth through the levels. kSystematic decline through the levels. a Teachers use consistently more or less of this feature across levels. b Students use consistently more or less of this feature across levels.

If we look at the distribution patterns of each linguistic feature in this group (see Table 6), a consistent pattern across all levels seem to be apparent. In general, teachers at all educational levels tend to use more activity verbs, adverbial clauses of condition, and directive verbs. As for present tense and commonly occurring vocabulary, this pattern is only true for undergraduate-level classes. This distribution suggests a strong explanatory and directive orientation from the teacher across levels.

At the same time, student talk consistently contains more contractions, first, second, and third person (inanimate) pronouns and pro-forms. Compared to teachers, student turns also tend to display more active voice at all levels, and in graduate classes, more of the commonly occurring vocabulary items as well. The constellation of these features characterizes the way students present their thoughts and as discussed before, suggest an interactive, dialogic type of discourse.

Examining the results from another perspective, we see a tendency of steady change in both teacher talk and student talk throughout the levels. Teachers tend to include more of the following features in their talk as we progress from low-level undergraduate classes to graduate classes: present tense, first and second person pronoun, third person pronouns including pro-forms, modals, and adverbial clauses of condition. At the same time, there is a consistent drop in their use of activity verbs and commonly used vocabulary items. For students, there seems to be a steady growth in their use of activity and directive verbs, and in personal pronouns.

# 3.2.2. Personalized framing

As mentioned before, personalized framing features include that deletion, likelihood verbs with that complement clauses, factual verbs with that complement clauses and expressions such as I mean and you know. Overall, teachers hardly use the linguistic features in this feature group compared to students in all levels of instruction, but when they do, it is most dominant in graduate classes. In contrast, a clear lack of these features is apparent in low-division teacher talk, hence, the negative mean dimension score there (Fig. 4).

Examining the individual linguistic features in this feature group, it is apparent that third person pronouns, that deletion, likelihood verbs with that complement clauses, and $I$ mean appears consistently more in student talk across the three levels. At the same time, factual verbs with that clause and mental verbs are in teacher talk more often at all levels. Extract 7 below illustrates how these features appear in a student turn in a graduate-level class. Personalized framing features are in bold italics underlined.

Extract 7

(Graduate)

Looking at patterns of change from another perspective (Table 7), a tendency of growth through levels of instruction (from low division to graduate) is noticeable in both participants’ talk.

A consistent growth in the frequency of a few specific framing features is noticeable. The only feature in this group that both participants use consistently more of and across levels is verb complement clauses with that-deletion (e.g., I thought [that] he was a poet.). The two features consistently used more by teachers only as we move across the levels are factual verbs with that-complement clauses (e.g., demonstrate, realize) (Biber et al., 2004) and the discourse frame you know. On the other hand, only students use steadily more mental verbs and the expression I mean. Their use of third person animate pronoun shows a consistently declining tendency throughout the levels.

mSystematic growth through the levels. kSystematic decline through the levels. a Teachers use consistently more or less of this feature across levels. b Students use consistently more or less of this feature across levels.

This finding suggests that teachers accumulate verbs to ‘‘express information as fact or a true state of affairs’’ (Biber et al., 2004, p. 34) as they maintain their turn in a shared physical and mental space with expressions like you know. At the same time, as we go towards graduate-level classes, students express themselves with verbs denoting ‘‘a wide range of activities and states’’ excluding physical action or volition (Biber et al., 1999). As they verbalize their ‘‘cognitive and emotional meanings’’ (e.g., attitudes and desires), ‘‘perceptions,’’ and ‘‘receipt of communication’’ (Biber et al., 2004, p. 30) with mental verbs, they stay on-line in the shared mental space by inserting expressions like I mean. Further research could explore in detail how the patterns of varying types of verbs by the two participants may relate to perceived participant role and/or instructional purpose in university classrooms.

# 3.3. Summary of findings

In sum, teachers talk differently from students in North American university classrooms from multiple perspectives. Students take more turns than teachers do however, saying fewer than 30 words nearly $8 8 \%$ of the time they speak.

As for the disciplinary differences between teacher talk and student talk, three major patterns seem to emerge that could group or contrast particular disciplines. First, the results show that overall, in Business, Education and in Engineering classes, teachers use language associated with contextual features more intensively than in the other disciplines. However, these three disciplines markedly differ in the way personalized framing features are distributed between the two participant groups. In Education, both teachers and students use the personalized framing features while in Engineering, teachers and students equally lack language associated with personalized framing features in their speech. In Business, teachers are short of personalized framing features in their speech while students use them most robustly, in fact, among all of the six disciplines. Second, Natural Science and Social Sciences teacher talk is unmarked, and student talk is characterized by contextual features in both disciplines. At the same time, Natural Science teacher talk is without personalized framing features, while Social Sciences teachers use them. Third, in Humanities classes, teachers use features associated with a conceptual, informational focus while student talk is unmarked and both participants use personalized framing features.

As for levels of instruction, in low-division classes, student talk is comprised of dominantly contextual features, and differs from teachers in the high use of personalized framing features. In both upper division and in graduate classes, contextual features are used similarly by teacher and student alike, while personalized framing features are used dominantly by the students. However, the results also show that both teachers and students prefer particular linguistic features as we move across the levels. In terms of the first feature group (Contextual orientation), the two participants differ in that only teachers tend to use more modals and adverbial clauses of condition as well as fewer common vocabulary as we move across the levels, while only students tend to use a growing number of activity verbs. In the third feature group (Personalized framing), it is apparent that teachers prefer complement clauses that are introduced by verbs stating a proposition as fact (Biber et al., 2004) and the expression you know, while students use more mental verbs and the expression $I$ mean. Further discussion of these findings, implications, and further research is in the next section.

# 3.4. Further discussion

The present study contributes to earlier work on characterizing academic language use in native English speaking university settings. Applying corpus-based methods to the analysis, the work presented here explored patterns of linguistic variation in teacher talk versus student talk in six disciplines and three levels of instruction in North American Universities.

Resemblance in language use by the teacher on the first feature group (Contextual orientation) in Business, Education, and Engineering suggests that the material is presented to the students in similar ways in these classes. Teachers might exploit contextual support more intensively in these classes for their presentation by utilizing visual clues such as, graphs, computer software, or textual data. In contrast, the difference in the use of the third feature group (Personalized framing) among these three disciplines indicates a fundamentally different way to process the material in these class sessions. As it appears, both participants in Education classes display linguistic evidence of involved, on-line discourse suggesting that the material is processed through collaborative efforts where the teacher might be equally involved in the discussion. However, the lack of linguistic features associated with such discourse in Engineering classes suggests that propositions are made in a different manner there. Instead of emerging discussions, the material might be presented through monologic discourse, whether by teacher or student. In Business, the fact that teachers tend to lack personalized framing features while students use most of them indicates a third variation in involvement. While discussions may be apparent in these classes as well, as we have seen in Education, the teacher might take a more passive role in the discussion. Whether this difference between Education and Business is due to diverse views on the role of a mentor needs further research. Finally, in Humanities classes, the material seems to be presented without relying on the context, but the classes reflect an interpretative, discussion-oriented type of processing, as in Education.

The individual grammatical features preferred by the teachers across the levels of instruction indicate a characteristic all teachers share in all classes. They create a mental space for their students by bringing up several hypothetical situations in their presentation, as evidenced by the use of modals and adverbial clauses of condition. At the same time, they acculturate their students into the academic discourse community. This process is most commonly discussed in teaching writing; however, as we see here, it is also apparent in the classrooms. The declining number of common vocabulary by the teacher suggests that more specialized, discipline-specific concepts might replace those common words as they move across the levels.

# 4. Implications and further research

This study discussed the systematic differences in language variation between teacher and student as it relates to disciplines and levels of instruction. The implications of this study could be of interest to discourse analysts as well as teachers. First, corpus-based quantitative approaches to analyzing classroom discourse allow for comprehensive linguistic analyses of a register dominantly researched through qualitative approaches. While other studies are invaluable in describing subtleties of the classroom context as they focus on topic content, purpose, participant identities, and relationships in great depth, the strength of this approach is that it provides comprehensive descriptions in reporting on the general patterns of linguistic variation. In this particular study, results show what is typical of the two participants’ talk in North American university classes, shedding light on how the two participants’ language use differs in various disciplines and across the three levels of instruction. In this analytical framework, a quantitative approach is applied to linguistic profiling first, and issues of participant roles and instructional purposes are discussed as they surface through the linguistic analyses, offering new avenues to approaching such issues.

Following the same analytical approach, the second implication is for studies of classroom discourse. Identifying turn length before examining turn content offers an alternative perspective to describing turns, their lexico-grammatical content, and their functions. Due to space limitations, this study was unable to reach as far as describing turn functions for the chosen turn length. However, it is possible to identify turn types based on the linguistic characteristics of a turn, and relying on those types, identify turn functions. This is an area for further research. As mentioned above, the principles of the analytical framework supporting this approach are different from those that initially identify turns based on their pre-defined categories of function, and offers new ways to analyzing not only classroom discourse but perhaps face-to-face conversations or other types of dialogic discourse as well.

Third, perhaps the most difficult job for an ESL/EFL learner in a university class session is to keep up with the changes in language use as they relate to changes in communicative or instructional purpose. By showing the types of linguistic features teachers use as they shift communicative and instructional tasks could help ESL/EFL learners identify types of linguistic clues in teacher talk other than the well-researched discourse markers. With that, instructional materials could be further developed to train students on how different linguistic features signal these aspects of a university class. Additionally, training could also be extended to students formulating questions on line, and in a way that is perhaps longer than a clause.

Fourth, this study raises awareness about how university teacher language changes through the different levels of instruction. Knowing these patterns will help university instructors prepare their classes from a linguistic point of view besides the content. That is, keeping the content in mind, teachers could think about alternative ways to present the material and to facilitate the processing of the material. The results in this study indicate that teachers already think about differences between a ‘professional’ and a ‘novice’ group in terms of their vocabulary use.

Further immediate research is called for in two additional areas. First, the present study was limited to characterize teacher talk versus student talk to turns between 30 and 230 words, leaving turns both below and beyond these limits untouched. Given the fact that students tend to take many short turns and teachers tend to take many longer turns, if the present study had included all of those, our results would have been somewhat skewed. The optimal solution was to include the most possible language by both participants, which seemed to be between these two turn length measures. However, both the shorter and longer turns also need further exploration for both lexical and grammatical content. For example, research focusing on short turns (e.g., one to five words) and exploring the lexical variation in those turns to see patterns of distribution between the two speakers and their functions in the discourse is already in progress (Csomay, 2007).

Second, a more detailed analysis is due to the patterns of change in individual linguistic features across levels of instruction but within each discipline. In this study, the overall patterns were described briefly, but this may also vary in different disciplines. A fuller picture could be gained about how language used by teachers and by students might change in the different disciplines throughout the educational experience. Most insightfully perhaps, we could see whether students tend to talk more like their teachers the closer they get to graduate-level classes in the different disciplines as well.
