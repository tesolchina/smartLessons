# Abstract

This article is the result of a grounded theory investigation into the ways PhD topics are assigned by supervisors in engineering and selected by students in the social sciences/humanities in UK universities, broadly referred to as ‘topic arrangement’, which can be regarded as one aspect of academic socialisation into academic Discourse communities. Interview data was collected from thirteen Iranian PhD students studying in different UK universities and six of their supervisors during 2000e2001. One further interview was conducted with a professor of sociology. The interviews were transcribed, thematically coded, and analysed using NUD.IST. The results show that PhD students themselves often select PhD topics in the social sciences/humanities, whereas PhD topics are often assigned to PhD students by engineering supervisors. The reason for this difference in practice between these two fields seems to stem from different ideologies on what constitutes a PhD across disciplines, as well as funded projects, which are more likely to be available to engineering supervisors and students. Throughout the paper, a modest attempt has been made to draw the attention of EAP practitioners to a redefinition of the concept of Discourse with a big $\mathbf { \hat { \mu } } ^ { \mathbf { \hat { \mu } } } \mathbf { D } ^ { \prime }$ , which includes linguistic and nonlinguistic aspects of advanced academic literacy.

# 1. Introduction

The concept of discourse community is a core notion in EAP research. As Hyland and Hamp-Lyons (2002) observe, ‘‘[I]t is difficult to imagine EAP without some notion of community’’ (p. 6). This emphasis reveals an aim of EAP, i.e. to explore generic features of academic disciplines and transfer these to ESL students to facilitate acquisition of academic literacy. The underlying assumption of this objective is that EAP should primarily be concerned with linguistic, or more specifically, generic patterns of academic discourse communities. However, as Hyland and HampLyons (2002) also state, EAP experts have not limited themselves to ‘‘an exclusive focus on texts’’, but have also started to look into non-linguistic issues such as ‘‘aims, social behaviours, power relations, and political interests’’ (p. 6) of such communities. Within this latter trend, two objectives will be pursued in this paper. First the linguistic orientation of ‘discourse community’ will be considered. Building upon Gee’s (1999, p. 7) concept of ‘capital D Discourse’ and Wenger’s (1998) social learning theory of ‘communities of practice’, it will be argued that nonlinguistic aspects, for example, relations between university PhD students and their thesis supervisors and the way PhD topics are arranged, should also be included in the concept of Discourse communities. This is important in that it raises a very important issue for ESL research students. While research in EAP has traditionally been concerned with linguistic issues, it seems research with broader social orientation is needed to enhance our understanding in this area. The second and more specific objective is to look at the particular way PhD topics are arranged in a number of UK universities, which unlike US PhD education, is a main initiation rite in PhD education in the UK.

In this paper we will use ‘‘topic arrangement’’ to refer to either ‘‘assignment’’ of topics by supervisors or ‘‘selection’’ of topics by students. We will use ‘‘assignment’’ or ‘‘selection’’ whenever a distinction is needed.

# 2. Background

Casanave (1995) attributes the concept of ‘communities’ of scientists to Kuhn, which is probably based on the following quotation:

A scientific community consists,. of the practitioners of a scientific specialty. [who] have undergone similar educations and professional initiations; in the process they have absorbed the same technical literature and drawn many of the same lessons from it. (Kuhn, 1996, p. 177)

Though Bizzell (1982) and Herzberg (1986) had earlier discussed the concept of discourse community from a social standpoint, they were criticised for using the concept as a ‘‘convenient translation of the long-established concept of speech community common to sociolinguistics and central to the ethnography of communication’’ (Swales, 1990, p. 23). Swales (1990), however, further clarified the concept and drew distinctions between discourse and speech communities. He defines discourse communities as ‘‘socio-rhetorical networks that form in order to work towards sets of common goals’’ (p. 9). Though not made explicit, it can be inferred that his understanding of discourse is linguistically oriented. This is particularly manifested in the three distinctions he draws between speech and discourse communities. First the medium is different in these two concepts. Members of a discourse community often tend to communicate with each other via writing. Second, the ‘‘primary determinants of linguistic behaviour [in speech communities] are social’’, whereas those in a discourse community are ‘‘functional’’ (p.24). Members of a discourse community often have similar objectives to pursue, but speech communities tend to have different communicative priorities such as ‘‘socialisation or group solidarity’’ (p. 24). The third reason for the distinction between speech and discourse communities is that a speech community ‘‘inherits its membership by birth, accident or adoption,’’ while members of a discourse community are often ‘trained’ in order to receive membership credit (Swales, 1990, p.24).

Unlike researchers who have emphasised linguistic features for defining discourse communities, Rafoth (1990) suggests that the concept of discourse community should be associated with much more than language and should also take into account ‘‘how language operates to define one’s identity, to maintain the divisions of social class, to constrain access to power, and . to shape personal consciousness’’ (p. 147). Connor (1996) likewise argues that ‘‘novices in discourse communities need to learn both the conventions of language and writing as well as the accepted world view of the disciplinary values and practices’’ (p. 77).

Braine (2002) in an excellent review of research on academic literacy criticises Spack for narrowly defining academic literacy as ‘‘the ability to read and write the various texts assigned in [university]’’ (Spack, 1997), and argues that ‘‘the acquisition of ‘academic literacy’ that is essential for graduate studies is more than the ability to read and write effectively’’ (Braine, 2002, p. 60). After reviewing survey, case study, and interview research carried out on academic literacy (Canseco & Byrd, 1989; Casanave & Hubbard, 1992; Jenkins, Jordan & Weiland, 1993; Belcher, 1994; Schneider & Fujishima, 1995; Dong, 1996; Riazi, 1997; Gosden, 1996), Braine emphasises the importance of non-linguistic aspects and writes: ‘‘. as far as academic literacy is concerned, a fundamental shortcoming of most of these studies is their focus on writing tasks alone’’ (p. 63). He adds:

. graduate students not only need to build interactive relationships with their teachers, thesis supervisors, and peers, and develop effective research strategies and good writing skills, they also need to adapt smoothly to the linguistic and social milieu of their host environment and to the culture of their academic departments and institutions (Braine, 2002, p. 60)

Casanave, too, in her recent works has drawn attention to the ‘‘localized and political’’ (2002), as well as ‘‘sociopolitical’’ (2003) aspects of academic literacy.

EAP experts have not been alone in addressing issues relating to academic literacy. Colleagues in Higher Education (HE) have investigated non-linguistic aspects relating to academic disciplines, such as contrasting expectations of academic staff and students of what constitutes good academic writing in UK universities (Lea & Street, 1998), the role of supervisor feedback in students’ writing (Caffarella & Barnett, 2000), writing practices of experienced science writers (Parkhurst, 1990), student-supervisor relationships (Hill, Acker & Black, 1994; Youngman, 1994), and quality issues in the PhD (Phillips, 1994), among others.

It seems that experts in EAP and HE are in fact pursuing the same objective, i.e. exploring higher education cultures (Becher, 1981, 1989). But culture is a more inclusive concept than discourse. Our solution is to use a concept which is less panoramic than culture and more encompassing than language. In the next section, we will attend to this issue.

# 3. Academic discourse communities with a big ‘D’

Building upon Gee’s (1999) concept of ‘Big D’ Discourses as consisting of ‘‘language plus other stuff’’ (p. 17), we suggest that the arrangement of PhD topics be considered part of socialisation into ‘big D’ Discourse communities. Previous studies (e.g., Shaw, 1991; Jenkins et al., 1993) have made reference to the ways in which topics are selected in different disciplines, but these have only been at the descriptive level. An aim of this paper is to offer a conceptual structure within which to view some aspects of this issue. To achieve this aim, we base our analytical frameworks upon three ‘social turn movement’ (Gee, 2000) theories, namely: Discourse communities (Swales, 1990; Berkenkotter, Huckin & Ackerman, 1991; Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995); academic literacies (Lea & Street, 1998), and communities of practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998). We hope these frameworks will help us better understand the way PhD topics are arranged in the social sciences/humanities and engineering.

If we agree that full membership of academic communities of practice entails being able to conduct research and produce knowledge within the confines of that community, we can conceptualise PhD students as ‘newcomers’ to academic ‘communities of practice’ (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998) who should learn the ‘norms’ (Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995; cf. Gee, 1996, 1999 on ‘Discourses’) of their ‘Discourse communities’ if they are to be considered ‘legitimate members’ of their communities of practice. One of these ‘norms’ seems to be the initiation ritual in UK PhD programmes, namely the way topics are arranged for the PhD project.

We emphasize the contested nature of topic arrangement in line with the academic literacies tradition. Following Lea and Street (1998) on the contestations among tutors and students about what constitutes good writing, we regard topic arrangement in Discourse communities in a similar manner and try to capture perspectives of students and supervisors regarding this issue. Therefore, it would be reasonable to believe that looking at topic arrangement within this framework helps us understand the contested nature of this issue and see how this might address related issues in academic socialisation. This is why we will look at topic arrangement from the point of view of both the supervisors and students in this study.

# 4. Methodology

This study used a constructivist version of grounded theory (Charmaz, 2000, 2005; Schwandt, 2000), which has been a reaction against criticisms made of its earlier positivistic versions (Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Glaser, 1992; Charmaz, 1994). This version is based on the position that reality is constructed as a result of the interaction between the researcher and the data, and it emphasizes a systematic and rigorous approach to research involving simultaneous collection and analysis of data, open thematic coding, categorisation and integration of categories, and a gradual focusing of the research project. Implicit in the concept of ‘gradual focusing’ is that the researcher does not have very explicit research questions in mind when starting a project, but a series of broad research objectives, which are narrowed down as a result of data collection and analysis. That is why, as we will see later, our initial research questions were revised throughout the research process.

Table 1 Distribution of students, who took part in stage 1, on the basis of topic assignment.

Following a contrastive rhetoric perspective (Kaplan, 1966, 1987; Connor, 1987), we initially hypothesised that Iranian ESL students would have writing problems stemming from contrasting rhetorical organisations between Persian and English. In the first stage of the study 42 short interviews were conducted by Hasrati, taking between 5 to 15 minutes, with Iranian PhD students in different UK universities at various stages of their PhD. The aims were to know these students in person, ask for their email for future contact, see what type of writing was more important to them, categorise their writing problems, find out whether they were required to work in groups, and if that was the case, to explore if it had any impact on their writing. The sample was opportunistic and the data was collected in March 2000.

We assumed that all students needed to write a proposal at the start of their PhD, but we encountered students who had not written one. This was a ‘rich point’ (Agar, 1996, p. 35), as we had observed something the meaning of which did not fit in our frame of mind, and as a result the subsequent research objectives and data collection took a different turn. The next important question was: If some students do not need to write proposals, where do their PhD topics come from?

In the second stage, the same students were contacted through email and asked about the origins of their PhD topics. We received 30 responses, in which we encountered some students whose supervisors had assigned their PhD topics to them and others who in contrast had selected their PhD topics themselves.

The distribution of these students did not seem to be random. The assigned students were mostly from engineering and science-based fields while the non-assigned students were mostly from the social sciences/humanities. This finding had a dramatic effect on our research, leading us to start asking particular questions about the nature of topic arrangement and more general questions on the nature of academic socialisation into different academic disciplines. In this research, then, we started with a contrastive rhetoric orientation, but the focus of our research shifted to topic arrangement in PhD education.

Based on the data collected up to this stage of the research, we categorised the students as follows:

1) assigned: students who had received their specific topics and the methodology to answer the research questions from their supervisors; 2) semi-assigned: students who had received a broad topic, which they had to narrow down themselves; 3) non-assigned: the students who had formulated their own research questions and methodology.

The following table shows the distribution of the students according to the above criteria (Table 1):

At this point, the grounded theory approach of the study had led to two important categories, namely assignment and non-assignment, which were more apparent in engineering and social sciences/humanities respectively. Therefore, in the next stage we decided to focus only on social sciences, humanities and engineering students. This focus was also motivated by the links the primary researcher had with the students in these two areas. There were 16 engineering students in this stage of the study, 8 of whom agreed to be interviewed in the next stage. Moreover, in addition to the initial 3 social science/humanities students, 2 more were recruited to participate in the next stages (Table 2).

Informed by the data collection and analysis reported above, new research questions were formulated as follows: (1) How were the participating PhD students initiated into their courses? (2) How were their PhD topics arranged? And (3) What is the role of their supervisors and other students in their PhD work? In this stage of the study, qualitative data were collected through semi structured interviews with the 13 students referred to in the previous paragraph (Appendix A). In addition, interviews were conducted with 6 of the supervisors of the same students, who had positively replied to invitations to participate (Appendix B). Bizhan and Dr Smith, Farokh and Dr James, Koorosh and Dr Taylor, Shahram and Dr Scott, Farhad and Dr West, and finally Reza and Dr Jordan were student-supervisor pairs. A further interview was conducted with Dr Sanki, a sociologist, resulting in interview data from four supervisors in engineering and three in the social sciences/humanities. The student and supervisor interviewees were based in 5 different universities in the UK. All interviews with the students, except one, were conducted in Persian, and all interviews with the supervisors were conducted in English (Table 3).

# 5. Supervisors’ perspectives on topic arrangement

The participating engineering supervisors felt they were responsible to assign students with PhD topics for reasons to be discussed later. Shaw (1991) reported a similar finding in his study of the writing practices of science research students and observed that ‘‘Many [science] supervisors had had some influence on the choice of topic’’ (p. 192). The social sciences/humanities supervisors, on the other hand, believed that students themselves were responsible to select PhD topics, though they often helped their students narrow down the scope of their proposed topic.

It can be hypothesised that these disciplinary differences regarding topic arrangement stem from different assumptions on what a PhD entails. As is clear in the following quotation, it seems that selecting PhD topics is not part of the process of doing a PhD in engineering:

In science and engineering, students don’t know what to work on anyway. So you have to tell them (Dr Smith, Telecommunications).

The social sciences/humanities supervisors, however, believed that doing a PhD entails choosing a topic, evident in the following three quotations:

[Doing a PhD] is choosing a particular subject, a particular interest, and wanting to take that subject beyond its current boundaries of existing knowledge, and to take it into new areas, however modest that new area might be (Dr West, Education).

We have an expectation which is fairly standard in British Universities these days. After the first six months of the research onwards, every student is expected to present to the department a research report about 15000 words summarising what their . topic is, the work that has been done by other people and what they propose to do themselves (Dr Jordan, Anthropology).

I suppose for the community it’s . a rite of passage, it’s a test, a way of judging people’s skills and competence, as potential members of the disciplines, like in some African tribes where a young boy is sent out into the jungle to hunt tigers or lions. If they come back, they come back as men, so if you finish your PhD, you come out as a mature member of the community . (Dr Sanki, Sociology).

The engineering supervisors often conceived of topic assignment as a strategy to initiate students into their disciplines. Before assigning PhD topics, however, they assigned small tasks, the answer to which they already knew:

The first thing I would do is, actually, be somewhat Machiavellian, in that I would set them short assignments for which I already know the answer (Dr Taylor, Rock Mechanics).

There was a concord among three of the engineering supervisors in adhering to the above strategy. These small tasks were meant to motivate students and to evaluate them in terms of their capabilities in doing research. After this initial assignment of small tasks, engineering supervisors assigned their students the ‘real topics’ of their PhDs:

And when they get on board, I give them . their real topic of research (Dr Smith, Telecommunications).

As observed above, among the engineering participants of the present study, the initiation ritual of assigning topics to PhD candidates seemed to be part of the ‘big D’ Discourse of these fields, while this was not the case in the social sciences/humanities.

# 5.1. Funding

It seemed that decisions on topic assignment in the engineering Discourse communities under study, although to some extent regulated by assumptions on what constitutes a PhD, were affected in non-trivial ways by funded projects referred to university departments from industry and other funding bodies. In other words, there were both ideological and material considerations that affected topic assignment. There also seemed to be a sharp difference between the number of funded projects in the social sciences/humanities and engineering fields. None of the social sciences/ humanities supervisors involved their PhD students in funded projects, while at least two of the engineering supervisors did so. In fact one reason for which the engineering supervisors assigned topics was the request of students:

But many times they [students] come to me, because I have money not because they are interested in my topics. So money talks actually, not my research background or interest, or even my knowledge. (Dr Smith, Telecommunications).

Other reasons mentioned by the engineering supervisors to assign PhD topics were the need for ‘manpower’ to do supervisors’ ‘current funded projects’, and answering the many ‘unanswered questions’ the supervisors had, but had never had the time to answer themselves. It is interesting to consider this from the perspective of an engineering student:

When I met my supervisor, he had the topic already. So it wasn’t the case that I had a topic beforehand. In fact my supervisor had a bigger project which he had divided into smaller ones and had each of his students to do one of them. So there’s been no decision on my part. The project was decided upon before I arrived here (Farokh, Electronics)

The engineering supervisors, however, did not rule out the possibility of students selecting topics, but they believed that this was very rare in engineering and in addition, the supervisor would not be able to offer much help to students who had selected their own topics. As a result students would be left alone to work through their projects. Shaw (1991), too, reported that science students who had selected their own topics felt isolated because ‘‘they had little to do with departmental projects’’ (p. 193). As we will see in Section 7.2, Armin, a naval architecture student, had a similar experience.

The two social sciences/humanities supervisors did not assign topics. This could be explicable in terms of the prevalent assumption in these fields according to which a PhD entails choosing topics. Social sciences/humanities supervisors have less access to funded research, and those who do rarely involve their PhD students in such projects. The practice of ‘laying topic choice with students’ has been reported to be creating some difficulties for the successful progress of the PhD in the social sciences (Burgess, 1994, p. 6).

The fourth engineering supervisor was very much in the same circumstances as the two social sciences/humanities supervisors, in that she had no access to funds from industry. The reasons for this lack of access to funding will be discussed later, but it is important to emphasize that she still assigned topics to her students, although she only assigned broad areas of enquiry rather than specific topics. In other words, her students were semi assigned whereas students of the other engineering supervisors were assigned.

# 6. Students’ perspectives on topic arrangement

As mentioned earlier, seven out of the eight engineering students were assigned topics by their supervisors, while this was not the case for any of the social sciences/humanities students, who were considered capable of determining what constituted a legitimate PhD topic:

And he gave me a copy of his book, and a copy of his CV, and said, ‘‘You can choose a topic compatible with my experience. Or you can choose whatever else you want. I don’t want to limit you’’. (Reza, Anthropology).

However, they were not considered full experts, and their supervisors often had some influence in narrowing down their topics:

[My PhD topic] was something general at first, i.e., I wanted to compare the Balochi language with Sogdian in all aspects. But after some discussion, my supervisor asked me to focus on only one aspect, so I narrowed down my topic to the comparison between the verbs in Balochi and all other Iranian middle languages (Hamid, Ancient Languages).

A similar influence is evident in the following quotation:

My main question remained almost untouched. But because [my supervisors] believed that my research was too broad, they narrowed [it] down. (Dariush, History).

In contrast, the engineering students were not considered at a level to select a topic, and topic choice was left to the supervisors to decide. As Bizhan (engineering) put it, his supervisor knew what topics were ‘‘fashionable’’, or as Berkenkotter and Huckin (1995, p. 3) point out ‘what winds were blowing’ and what issues were ‘at the cutting edge’ in the field. That was why he had accepted a topic by his supervisor. Some engineering students had asked for topics themselves. One, for instance, mentioned ‘a guarantee for success’ as his reason for asking to be assigned a topic. He had been advised by senior students in his department to do so, because, as he put it, supervisors would not assume any responsibility if something went wrong for topics selected by students. In addition, if such topics were not among the specialties of the supervisors, they would not be able to give as much support as they would to students with assigned topics. It is interesting to note that these beliefs were common among the engineering supervisors and students under study.

Topic assignment had a negative side as well. For instance, Saeed, an engineering student, believed that his initial consent to be assigned a topic had an effect on his identity:

From then on I changed into a person who had to accept whatever my supervisor said since I had no expertise or background in that area. (Saeed, Fluid Mechanics).

Another engineering student, Farokh, reported that for the first few months it had not been made explicit to him that the topic assigned to him was part of a bigger funded project of his supervisor. After two years, the project had been completed and he had upgraded from MPhil to PhD, but the extent of his share of the project was not sufficient for him to be granted a PhD. As a result he was left wondering what to do with the rest of his study:

Now I don’t know what to do. I know what I have done is not enough for a PhD, and I should find a way of expanding it to make a PhD out of it (Farokh, Electronics).

Assignment of topics by engineering supervisors seemed to be part of the big ‘D’ Discourses of the engineering Discourse communities under study. And being responsible to find one’s own line of research seemed to be among the

Discourses of the social sciences/humanities Discourse communities. This distinction and its consequences, however, were not often made explicit.

# 7. Boundary cases

In this section we consider an engineering supervisor and two engineering students who seemed to be showing features outside the mainstream practices of engineering sites under study, and refer to them as boundary cases. We believe that boundary cases are important in that they help us understand different disciplinary cultures (Also see Deem & Brehony, 2000).

The issue of topic assignment was a borderline between the social sciences/humanities and engineering. Whenever an engineering student selected their own topic, they crossed the borderline and we may say we are dealing with a boundary case. Likewise, involving PhD students in funded projects seemed to be specific to engineering supervisors. So an engineering supervisor who did not have access to funded projects or did not involve their PhD students in such projects could be regarded as a boundary case.

Based on the discussion above, we can hypothesise that if an engineering supervisor did not have access to funding, he or she would not assign topics. However, a participant engineering supervisor did not believe in funded projects, yet she assigned topics. We will refer to this engineering supervisor as Dr Scott, and elaborate on her case in more depth.

# 7.1. Dr Scott as an engineering boundary case

Dr Scott worked in a computing department. She mentioned two purposes for doing a PhD in computing, a ‘mercenary’, and a ‘utopian’ one:

The main reason is that the student wants to move into academic life, the mercenary reasons for it. But also people do PhDs simply because they’re very interested in something, and they simply want to pursue it further, . the kind of utopian view of doing a PhD (Dr Scott, Computing).

According to Dr Scott, students often had mercenary purpose although they could have started with a utopian one. She adhered to a utopian view herself, which was quite different from the pragmatic views of other engineering supervisors, e.g., Dr Smith’s expression ‘‘money talks’’ and Dr Taylor’s need for ‘‘manpower’’ to help him answer his unanswered questions. In contrast, it was similar to what social sciences/humanities supervisors expressed regarding students’ motives for doing a PhD. This particular distance between Dr Scott and the prevalent ‘big D’ Discourse of engineering Discourse communities is the reason why we have categorised her as a boundary case. As we will explain shortly, this seems to be an important finding and probably explicable once the issue of funding in computing in UK universities is explained.

According to Dr Scott, contrary to the situation in the US and some European countries, there was very little liaison between computing departments and industry in the UK. Industrial partners in the UK are usually reluctant to have their projects conducted by computing departments for two main reasons. First, PhDs often take three to four years to complete, and given the speed with which the applied side of computer science is progressing, it is not economical to refer their projects to universities. Second, research projects are often secret for business reasons and companies do not want students to give seminars on them in public. These factors have made it almost impossible to conduct applied research in computing in UK universities. As a result, most computing PhD students study theoretical topics.

Though we do not wish to generalise, it seems that there is a relationship between funding and topic assignment. As we saw earlier, Dr West (Education) was an idealist about the purpose of doing a PhD and believed that doing a PhD entails ‘‘pushing the boundaries of science further’’. Dr Scott had exactly the same idea. It is an interesting coincidence that neither of them had much or any access to funding. On the other hand, all the other engineering supervisors (Dr Smith, Dr James, and Dr Taylor) had current funded projects, which they had divided into manageable units to be carried out by their PhD students. Their view on doing a PhD was more practical and applied than utopian, as is evident in their beliefs about the purpose(s) of doing a PhD. Dr Smith believed that doing a PhD helped one become a better teacher and researcher, which would in turn contribute to social development. Dr James mentioned ‘pursuing an academic career’ as a reason why people do PhDs. And finally Dr Taylor believed that one purpose for doing a PhD is to help one teach more efficiently at undergraduate level. In contrast, Dr Scott, our boundary case, criticised the status quo, i.e., assigning topics to PhD students, and argued for ‘student self development’ and ‘freedom’ to pursue their individual line of interest. She was not rigid about research topics selected by students so long as they fell within the broad framework of her interests. She often offered her PhD students suggestions for the first two or three months and let them explore and decide what they wanted to do within the framework she had pointed out. Dr. Scott acknowledged that the process of selecting a topic could be a source of tension between her and her students in the initial stages:

Usually there is a slight tension because the student comes knowing what they want to do, the supervisor knows what they want the student to do, and it’s not always exactly the same. And you sort of have to compromise both sides a little bit (Dr Scott, Computing).

In sum, it seems that while assignment of PhD topics was part of the ‘big D’ Discourses of engineering Discourse communities, topic arrangement was also influenced by material conditions, i.e. access to funding.

# 7.2. Armin and Shahram as engineering boundary cases

In this section, we will focus on two engineering PhD students who had trespassed on the borderlines of their respective Discourse communities, one by refusing to be assigned a topic by his supervisor, and the other by not feeling happy about it. They will act as ‘telling cases’ (Mitchell, 1984, p. 239) to help us better understand norms and expectations regarding PhD education in engineering.

Armin was an engineering student studying naval architecture, categorised as non-assigned in the pilot study. He had come from Iran with a definite idea of what he was going to do. Upon arrival, he had found that his supervisor wanted to divert him to his own areas of interest, which he had rejected, and he had had to change his supervisor. As a result of an unfortunate accident, this second supervisor was paralysed, and the graduate tutor of the school had accepted to supervise him. He had been very helpful in providing him with the facilities he required for his experiments, but he wasn’t able to offer him much technical advice, as Armin’s topic was not among his areas of interest. In addition, Armin did not communicate with other members of his department because his selected topic was not among mainstream topics in that department. To cut a long story short, he had not finished his PhD after seven years.

The second student boundary case was Shahram (computing). Neither Shahram nor his supervisor, Dr Scott, believed in doing research for funding. Dr Scott, as we saw in Section 7.1, believed that funding restricted students and did not allow them to develop. Nonetheless, she had assigned a framework for Shahram and restricted him in his choice of topic. This created some degree of tension at the beginning between them, but at the end Shahram decided to oblige by adhering to the framework:

I feel I am working on something other people are interested in. So my main purpose for the time being is to get the certificate . and then work on something I am interested in myself (Shahram, Computing).

Shahram and Armin were similar in that they did not believe in funded projects and had an idealist view on doing a PhD. They wanted to pursue their own interests, a practice common in the social science/humanities, not in their own field. Their difference was that Armin had not accepted to follow expectations in an important aspect of the prevalent Discourse in his field, namely topic assignment, whereas Shahram had decided that he had no choice other than to agree to pursue the topic assigned by his supervisor.

# 8. Discussion

In this article we have tried to frame the idea of topic arrangement in the broader context of academic socialisation into Discourse communities, and have argued that PhD students can be regarded as novice members of ‘communities of practice’ (Wenger, 1998) trying to participate in the practices of their respective research communities. This involves getting to know the ‘shared repertoire’ of their communities of practice and engaging with other members.

We have particularly problematized ‘assignment’ of topics by supervisors or ‘selection’ of topics by students as different realisations of ‘topic arrangement’. Though at the start of this research it seemed that topic arrangement was mainly influenced by prevalent assumptions on what constitutes a PhD, we later found that it was modified by material conditions such as funds available to conduct research in engineering. In fact funding was so important that it was often the main determining factor wherever it was available.

Though not intending to generalise beyond the confines of the present study, we identified topic assignment by supervisors and student involvement in funded projects as norms in engineering, and topic selection by students as a norm in the social sciences/humanities. Then we identified two engineering boundary students and an engineering boundary supervisor and argued that these were located at one of the borderlines of defining categories identified for the social sciences/humanities and engineering.

Following Gee’s (1996, 1999) distinction between big ‘D’ and small ‘d’ discourses, we have argued for a redefinition of the concept of discourse communities written with a small ‘d’ and Discourse communities written with a big ‘D’. Within the latter perspective, ‘Discourse’ is much more than merely linguistic and rhetorical conventions. It is much broader in scope and deals with issues such as relationships between members of a community, specifically those between novices and established experts, the ways novices are recruited and initiated into Discourse communities, and even the conventions regarding legitimate topics and legitimate research methodologies. Topic arrangement as an initiation ritual in British universities is particularly important because it is rarely made explicit. As shown in section 7.2., this lack of explicitness might lead to tensions between supervisors and students. It would be plausible to assume that making such implicit Discourses explicit would improve PhD submission and completion rates.

Ivanic (1998) on the development of academic writing in native English speakers in UK universities writes: ‘‘they [mature students] have not had a smooth, uninterrupted path through the education system like regular undergraduates, so what is demanded of them is unlikely to ‘come naturally’ ’’ (page 5). We can extend this argument and state that all aspects of Discourse are unlikely to ‘come naturally’. The need to clearly explicate such Discursive issues is even more pressing for ESL students. Though it might seem paradoxical, we assume that a formal training course of some sort would be needed to prepare students for what they should expect to learn informally (see Cheetham & Chivers, 2001; Eraut, 2000; and Hasrati, 2005, on formal and informal learning).

It is interesting to note that linguistic aspects of Discourse communities have been extensively studied to help graduate students acquire academic literacy, but relatively few attempts have been made to investigate issues which might prove more important. In this paper, we have problematised only one such issue, i.e. PhD topic arrangement, which can be situated among initiation rites of academic Discourse communities, or practices upon doing a PhD. It would be interesting to see further research studies investigating practices through doing a PhD, including interpersonal communications in the academic arena, and practices related to finalising a PhD, such as discursive practices at oral exams. Conceptualising Discourse communities with a big ‘D’ will, we hope, lead to further research in these areas and help us incorporate the findings in our teaching.
