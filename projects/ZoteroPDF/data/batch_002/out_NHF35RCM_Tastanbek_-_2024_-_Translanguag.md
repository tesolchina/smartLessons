Translanguaging Critical pedagogy Academic writing EAP   
Multilingualism

English for Academic Purposes (EAP) instructors may struggle to capitalize on students' multilingual practices in teaching and demystifying academic writing, considering the expectation to use standard English. My teaching report is situated in Qazaqstan, where I worked as an EAP instructor with first-year undergraduate students for whom Qazaq and Russian are the dominant languages, English is a foreign language, and translanguaging is a commonplace practice. The paper shares how I built on my shared linguistic and cultural background with my students to implement translanguaging pedagogy for teaching EAP writing in a hybrid course at an Englishmedium university. A major takeaway from my teaching experience is to establish a translanguaging space, in which students with different translanguaging beliefs can explore pedagogical translanguaging. The pedagogical translanguaging instructions used in writing one academic essay were focused on developing an outline, citations, and rough drafts. Throughout the essay completion in person and online, students and I discussed translanguaging writing examples, drew on our metalinguistic awareness, and critical discussions of linguistic choices. Overall, this paper illuminates on how an EAP instructor with a similar linguistic background to their students can disrupt monolingual norms, and use translanguaging pedagogy for linguistically just academic writing instruction

During one of my sessions in an English for Academic Purposes (EAP) clas, I decided to employ translanguaging as a scaffolding technique. o my surprise, a student remarked, It'sso unusual to hear you speak a language other than English. This comment led me to a moment of reflection. I realized that, despite having a shared linguisic repertoire with most of my students that includes Qazaq and Russian, I had been predominantly using English in my teaching. This realization raised questions about my translanguaging stance that I had started developing during my MA in Multilingual Education. As argued by Garcia et al. (2017), ths stance allows educators like meto draw on students' entire linguisic rpertoire to support their learning, creating space for academic development through multilingualism, and fostering their growth in developing multilingual identitie. Recent research indicate that adopting a translanguaging perspective can significantly enhance EAP instruction, leading to positive learning outcomes (Liu et al., 2020; McIntosh et al., 2017; Sun, 2022). While pedagogical translanguaging trategies typically involve alternating languages of input and output and using translanguaging to scaffld learning (Williams, 1994), i is essential to understand that translanguaging pedagogy extends beyond these approaches (see Garcia et al., 2017).

To ilustrate how translanguaging pedagogy can be purposefully used in EAP writing instruction, in this paper I build on my teaching experience as a Qazaq multilingual EAP instructor. I situate my practice by laying out the restraints of the larger sociopolitical context, my institution, and my classroom. Following that, discus the ideas of translanguaging space and translanguaging pedagogy in EAP writing instruction and draw attention to their implementation in how I teach writing a problem-solution esay. Finall, I share the lessons I learnt from my translanguaging pedagogy in EAP writing instruction.

# 1. Context

Having discussed the importance of translanguaging pedagogy, let's delve into the contextual backdrop against which I applied this approach. In Qazaqstan, multilingual Qazaqs, including both my students and me, ften practice translanguaging. Translanguaging involves creatively and criticall crossing the boundaries of named languages such as Qazaq, Russian, and English to facilitate meaning-making, earning, and teaching (Goodman & Kerimkulova, & Montgomery, 2021; Li, 2011). I want to highlight that translanguaging is a sensitive topic for the wider public and teachers in Qazaqstan, where a trilingual policy promotes parallel monolingualism(s). Qazaq people tend to cl translanguaging for making meaning \*shala Qazaq" (Half Qazaq) out of concern for the recovery and development f our titular language, which was almost fully erased by the colonial language Russan. Meanwhile, Qaza English language educators tend to expres conflicting (hegemonic, reistant, and transformative) beliefs about translanguaging, positioning it as a pedagogically detrimental tool, a last resort, or a pedagogical resource (Goodman & Tastanbek, 2021; Tastanbek, 2019).

I also observed conflicting beliefs about translanguaging at the English-medium instruction (EMI) university where I worked as an English language instructor for two years (2019-2021). Despite the universty's English-only orientation and policy, my impression was that students and instructors sill surretitiously relied on translanguaging as a set of multimodal and multisensory learning and teaching straegies. Translanguaging seemed especially relevant since our universty admitted emerging multilingual students who officialy did not meet the minimum English proficiency level. Even if students entered below the required B1 level according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), they took a B1 level EAP course during the first trimester and a B2 level course in the second trimester. In this paper, I discuss my experience teaching five B2 level groups during the second trimester.

Several isues and affordance Inotied as an instructor motivated me to apply translanguaging pedagogy in teaching EAP writing Some students seemed to struggle to write essay outlines and rough drafts in English only, both of which required citing complex academic publications, and using academic language beyond their comfort zone. I assumed it was because their English level was lower than required, and they were also new to the problem-solution essay genre, a proces-based writing pedagogy, and citing ac. ademic publications to develop their outlines and support their claims. When I fllowed our institution's English-only policy and the monolingual teaching approaches promoted among EAP instructors, many students either did not write much or wrote something that raised suspicions of academic misconduct I saw hope in using translanguaging pedagogy because I noticed how both my students and spontaneously engaged in pedagogic translanguaging. Through metalinguistic commentary, students demonstrated a significant amount of academic genre knowledge during clases, which motivated me to use a more planed translanguaging pedagogy as a means for improving students' EAP writing experience.

# 2. Translanguaging space in EAP classroom

Now, as we move forward, let's explore the concept of creating a translanguaging space within the EAP classoom. To enact multilingual students' entire inguistc reertoire in the ehancement of their EAP writing, tachers can use the inovative practice of translanguaging pedagogy (Hiller, 2021; Sun, 2022). Doing so requires establishing a translanguaging space where both teachers and students feel empowered to engag in crtive and critical cros-boundary angaging practices (Li, 011). The full potntial of critical pedagogies such as translanguaging can be reached if both the classroom, intitutional and communal practices empower and support multilingual learners' dynamic language use (Allard, 2017).

As a part of an ecological approach to implementing translanguaging pedagogy, teachers can contrbute to the creation of a translanguaging space in several ways. They may encourage students to demonstrate their whole linguistic repertoire and asert ther multilingual identities (Machado & Hartman, 2019, p. 18), as well as model and give examples of translingual writing practices (Zapata & Laman, 2016). In a translanguaging space, a translanguaging approach to writing (Canagarajah, 2011) may be used to redefine and shift away from monolingual writing. However, McIntosh et al. (2017) maintain that teachers should be considerate of students beliefs and provide instruction for both translanguaging and monolingual ways of EAP writing (p. 17).

# 3. Translanguaging pedagogy for developing outlines, citations, and rough drafts

As we shift our focus towards the practical aplication of translanguaging pedagogy, I wil discus my pedagogical approach to the development of outlines, citations, and rough drafts. While translanguaging pedagogy can enhance English learners agency to redesign and transform writing (Ranker, 2009) at any level of English proficiency, it i especially useful for those with emerging EAP writing skills eachers can achieve better engagement with EAP writing tasks as pedagogic translanguaging can improve students participation during lessons and understanding of writing concepts (Ngubane et al., 2020).

Research also shows that translanguaging pedagogy helps with scaffolding the development of outlines,citations, and rough draft. Prilutskaya and Knoph (2020) state that a translanguaging approach can be used to generate ideas and structure information, while Hungwe (2019) demonstrated its implementation in paraphrasing to increase academic text comprehension. Similarly, based on the work of Canagarajah (2011), students can translanguage to write drafts and to expres creativity and metalinguistic awareness

# 4. Implementation of translanguaging pedagogy

# 4.1. EAP course structure, format and writing assignment

With the above-mentioned strategies in mind, next I share their implementation within my EAP course. In the summer of 2020, after working with first-ear students at a Qazastani universty for over a year, I submitted a proposal to my department head with the idea to implement a translanguaging-based aproach in teaching EAP writing. After obtaining permission, I proceeded to prepare lesson plans and materials to use translanguaging in teaching writing a problem-solution esay of 600-800 words in the frame of a hybrid EAP course. According to the standard B2 level sllabus developed by me and my colleagues, the mult-ste essay needed to be completed during the ten-week long second trimeser (January-March 2021). As llustrated in Table 1, the steps included an outline, citations, problem paragraphs, solution paragraphs, an introduction, a conclusion, and the final draft. Students had no essay-writing deadlines during weeks 5 and 10 due to mid-term and end-term exams.

It should be noted that each of the eight essay-writing weeks in this hybrid course consisted of four forty-minute lessons: three synchronous and one asynchronous. Out of three synchronous lessons two were conducted in person back-to-back and one was online on a diffrent day via the digital platform Microsoft Teams. The two synchronous faceto-face esons with strict covid-19 safety mandates included introducing and doing guided practice tasks for each essay part. The third leson was geared to students working with their essays, sharing their work with peers, ealuating their peers work i a breakout room geting feedack from the intructor, and making adjustments.

Students completed the synchronous and asynchronous guided practice exercises on Padlet, a digital canvas-like platorm. Each group had their Padlet where the posts were visible to ll the group members. Therefore, every student was able to share their work with others and see their peers' writing strategies and style of translanguaging.

# 4.2. Creating translanguaging space for all students

To implement my translanguaging pedagogy in EAP writing instruction, I tarted with strategicall creating a translanguaging space in my classoom. At the instittional level, my irst step was discussing my ideas withcolleagues and receiving permission from my department head to implement translanguaging pedagogy. At the classroom level,I started by generating critical discussions of academic English language, students' multilingual practices and examples of translanguaging both in and out of the classroom. For instance, during the first wee of the course, students and I discussed their challenges with academic writing in connection to the first trimester's EAP course. They also shared how and if their translanguaging could be harnessed in writing afer I provided examples of translanguaging in informal genres and the more formal genre of EAP writing.

The provided examples of informal translanguaging or translanguaging \*in the wild" included screenshots of my social media posts (See Fig. 1). An example of my translanguaging texts is "Bacouna #codeswitching Men #translanguaging romyenrrepini anau3i 60nn) acranfan KMoic coHoua autobiographical nrative iquiry-re ananet" which translates into \*The paper that was initilly the conceptual analsis of #codeswitching an #tanslanguaging turned into an autobiographical narrative inqury." As most if not all the students shared the same linguistic and cultural background as me, they were invited to discuss the post and how it ollows or disrupts the monolingual norms of writing. I used students metalinguistic awareness and drew their attention to the transcended boundaries of grammar, vocabulary, script, and other linguistic features. I also stressed the role of translanguaging in performing one's multilingual identity, making meaning by critical drawing on allthe ailable multilingual resources as wellas expressing creativit. At the same time, I noted that the examples only show one way of translanguaging and encouraged students to find their voice and perform their idiosyncratic (trans)languaging.

After the initial activities for creating a translanguaging space, I gave students information about my planned pedagogy and answered any of their questions. I explained the purpose of implementing my pedagogy with an emphasis on its potential to improve their writing using the languages they know. To avoid confusing the students, I alled translanguaging a creative use of Qazaq, Russian, English, and ther languages. The students were iven the choice to us this creative approach in writing the outine and the firt drafts of the esay, including citations, main body, introduction, and conclusion. I highlighted that they could stop using this approach in writing at any moment and instead write their whole essays in English only. To adhere to the English-only policy of the university, I instructed the students to produce the final draft of the essy in standard English. In other words, found an optimal way of integrating translanguaging into the standard EAP curriculum that mainly uses monolingual ways of teaching academic writing. As a result fthis compromise, stdents had a choico build on ther fll linguistc rertoires but alsoopt for lening to write esas only in aademic English. It means each essay part's instructions included both translanguaging and monolingual approaches to EAP writing, allowing students to decide what works best for them. I provided students with two template for writing their problem-solution essays: one for writing it in English only and another with translanguaging-informed writing steps.

Once I formally started instructing students to translanguage in their writing, I purposefully maintained a translanguaging space n my classes. Translanguaging was formally acknowledged and regarded as a learning resource. Throughout the term, for instance, I created a space for discussing students' creative language use in writing and providing relevant critical commentary from both the instructor and the students. Particularly, I used Padlet to collaboratively provide formative feedack to students' written work. Once each student uploaded and/or copy-pasted their relevant essay, their prs and I provided constructive fdback on what i done well and what could be improved regarding translanguaging and beyond. Similarly, students and I discussed their work further via Microsoft Teams chat and during my office hours in person.

While I undersood that not allstudents would be interested in applying the suggested translanguaging strategies in writing, I decided to create a translanguaging space for all. I did so by explaining my pedagogy to allstudents and providing both translanguaging and monolingual intructions for the relevant tasks. By increasing all students' awarenessof this creative languaging, I hoped to create the feeing of togetherness instead of otheness when it comes to diverse translingual aroaches to writing. That way, those who wanted to translanguage in writing their essays would find solidarity and support from their peers opting for monolingual strategies.I saw this as necesary because embracing translanguaging both in and out f the classoom might take more time for some students than others. A possiblexplanation is that they resist critical pedagogies such as translanguaging pedagogy in writing due to their established monolingual ideologies (Yuan & Yang, 2020).

# 4.3. Translanguaging pedagogy for outline development

During the first week, I started using translanguaging pedagogy to scaffold students' work on their outlines. irst, students learnt how to work with the outine template to create their outlines, use academic sources to pick key ides they want to include in the essay and build the outlines using the monolingual outline sample. Then, they were introduced to the translanguaging outline sample (See Table 2). Drawing on their metalinguistic awareness, encouraged them to discs the language choices in the translanguaging outline sample and give the reasons why it could be helpful to translanguage in the outline.

As students narrowed down their topics and found five academic references during the first week, they needed to identify the main points they would iketo include in their ody paragraphs and post them on Padlet. During the third leson of the second week, I paired up students to work in Microsoft Teams breakout rooms to complete two tasks: 1) to explain their outlines to each other; 2) to give peer feedback. Basd on my impressions, in additionto translangaging in wriing, students also translanguagd orall. If stdents hesitated to continue translanguaging orall, I assured them it was not an issue and that they continue communicating the same way. While visiting the breakout rooms, I reviewed the outlines on Padet to prepare fedback for the whole group. Once the students were back from pair work, I gave them general feedback and tips for improving the outlines for submission. The submitted outlines suggested that students took the keywords and phrases from their sources in English, and then provided some elaboration through translanguaging.

# 4.4. Implementation model for citations: original transitional final

During the second week, I provided instructions for using translanguaging to develop citations. The suggested three steps for paraphrasing were original transitional final. At the original stage, students had to choose a part of their academic source they wanted to paraphrase. At the transitional stage, they could translanguage to put the original text in their own words and process the information in the source. Meanwhile, the last stage required them to produce an English-only version of the paraphrase. The slides I used during lessons contained the instructions and examples for each step of making citations (See Table 3).

Although I encouraged my students to cite academic publications in any named language, they chose to work with English. language sources. Perhaps, i isdue to my use of reliable English-language sources in the examples. The translanguaging citation template contained stages, instructions, and examples that students could take to write the paraphrases and summaries using translanguaging. Students would need to follow the same steps in case they worked with sources in Qazaq and Russian.

As a guided practice, I intructed my students t find a quote from one f their sources and work on paraphrasing it on Padlet using the three stages from Table 3. To that end, they had to.

1. Write one paraphrase with an in-text citation in APA   
2. Share the paraphrase with a partner   
3. Assess the partner's paraphrase and give recommendations using the assessment rubric   
4. Discuss the faced challenges in paraphrasing and their recommended strategies.

When working on the first tep, each student worked individuall with a choice t follow the three stages of paraphrasing (Table 3). To complete the second and third steps, students were paired to work in breakout rooms. In pairs, they were instructed to read each other's paraphrases, discussed their work proces and result, and gave peer fedback. I asumed that students were able to help each ther, a all of them shared a similar linguistic repertoire with the same named languages. Regadless,I visited the breakout rooms to give additional guidance and feedback. After students discussed their challenges and recommendations in the fourth step, I gave feedback to the whole group and answered any additional questions about both monolingual and translanguaging approaches to paraphrasing.

# 4.5. Translanguaging pedagogy: Completing the writing assignment

Afer the explicit demonstration of translanguaging strategies and instructions for their use in developing outlines and citations, continuously encouraged students to strategicall translanguage in thir esay rough drafts. To that end, each subsequent week students had a choiceto engage in translanguaging exercises like the ones completed during Weeks 1-2. The final stage of esay writing involved compiling the drafts of the esay parts and revising them. Per the course requirements, I asked my students to turn in their essays in English. During week 9, we completed exercises for prooreading and peer feedback, which allowed my students to polish their esays before submision for grading. As we approach the conclusion, I would like to reflect on the insights gained from applying

# 5. Lessons from applying translanguaging pedagogy in EAP writing

In summary, the exploration of translanguaging pedagogy in EAP writing instruction leads us to draw key takeaways. A major takeaway i to establish and maintin a translanguaging space when implementing translanguaging pedagogy. While there was no explicit pushack from the administrators of my MI university that promotes the use of English only, I felt aprehensive about the fficial use of my translanguaging methodology. I was able to implement translanguaging pedagogy more ecologicall (Allard, 2017) after 1) sharing my ideas with my colleagues and department head to gain their support, and 2) receiving my department head's permission. Instructors like me are likel to feel more confident about thir teaching in aformally recognized translanguaging space supported by their colleagues and supervior. Such space sems more conducive to learners agency to assert and perform their inguistic repertoires and identities as a resource (Li, 2011; Machado & Hartman, 2019). In my sustained translanguaging space, I put effrts to make translanguaging not a surprising crutch but a normal resource. Considering my positionality as a multilingual EAP instructor who shares a similar linguistic repertoire with my students, I was able to use my translanguaging to model its use in writing as well s to encourage embracing thir translanguaging and multilingual identities (Zapata & Laman, 2016). To transform students' writing and shift away from monolingual norms, we also continuously collaborated to discuss students translanguaging use in writing during classes and feedback sessions (Ranker, 2009; Zapata & Laman, 2016).

Additionally, EAP instructors like me need to be ready to finetune their translanguaging pedagogy based on their students course of action. For instance, my students chose to work with only English-language sources. Although I told them they could use sources in multiple named languages, my instructions included only examples of original texts in English (Table 3). The takeaway isto show not just tll, which means providing examples of original text in multiple named languages. Similarly, some students might think that translanguaging is only a playful linguistic practice for showing off their creativity. In my case, I acknowledged their creativity and translanguaging for fun. However, during our guided practice and ffice hours, I made sure to additionally remind students that they can and should use translanguaging to better generate ideas and structure the esay outlie (Prilutskaya & Knoph, 2020), better engage with academic sources and paraphrase (Hungwe, 2019), and draft the whole essay (Canagarajah, 2011). It is helpful to rfine your pedagogy and provide feedback that guides students back toward your EAP writing learning objectives.

Overall, educators and learners in multilingual contexts like Qazaqstan can tap into their shared linguistic and cultural resources via translanguaging pedagogy in EAP writing instruction. In a sustained translanguaging space, EAP instructors like me can take steps to formally harness translanguaging pejoratively known as "shala Qazaq' in Qazaqstan.
