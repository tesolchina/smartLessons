This study examined eight measures of syntactic complexity across published research article part-genres (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) and three social science disciplines (Applied Linguistics, Psychology, and Economics). The corpus of 240 complete texts was analyzed using a modified version of the Syntactic Complexity Analyzer (SCA), and the measures were compared across disciplinary and part-genre variables using a Two-way MANOVA and a series of follow up MANOVA and ANOVA tests. The findings highlight a significant large effect of both discipline and part-genre on all eight syntactic complexity indices, as well as a significant but small effect size for the interaction of move and discipline on the complexity measures. Important disciplinary and part-genre based differences in the use of syntactically complex structures are discussed, as are the implications of these findings on EAP writing research and pedagogy.

# 1. Introduction

There is a rich tradition in Applied Linguistics research of utilizing syntactic complexity as a means of measuring and benchmarking learner development (through a large set of indices; see Wolfe-Quintero, Inagaki, & Kim, 1998), and the scope of syntactic complexity scholarship within English for Academic Purposes (EAP) has expanded, as it is increasingly adopted as a means of analyzing the academic writing practices of disciplinary specialists and the texts produced by second language (L2) English student writers. The preponderance of syntactic complexity research overall has targeted the written production of L2 English writers, and such scholarship has considered the interplay between the production of syntactically complex structures in L2 English writing and genre (e.g., Lu, 2011; Staples & Reppen, 2016; Yoon & Polio, 2017), topic (e.g., Yang, Lu, & Weigle, 2015), and writing quality (e.g., Biber, Gray, & Staples, 2016; Bulte & Housen, 2014; Casal & Lee, 2019; Crossley & McNamara, 2014; Kyle & Crossley, 2018; Taguchi, Crawford, & Wetzel, 2013), with many studies emphasizing writing in first-year composition or standardized testing contexts. EAP studies have utilized syntactic complexity as a means of examining a broadening range of topics, such as the use of English as an academic lingua franca (Wu, Mauranen, & Lei, 2020), or comparisons of complex structures in expert and learner texts (e.g., Ansarifar, Shahriari, & Pishghadam, 2018), and interest in the ways in which academic texts are ‘complex’ has grown since Biber and Gray’s (2010) description of the compressed nature of academic writing overall.

An emerging line of research continues an important EAP aim of exploring the linguistic realizations of writers’ rhetorical goals by analyzing writers’ variable use of syntactically complex structures across rhetorical stages of research article (RA) writing (e.g., Casal, 2020; Liu & Lu, 2020; Lu, Casal, & Liu, 2020). This is part of broader EAP efforts to systematically integrate corpus-based analysis of formal linguistic features with move-based analysis of rhetorical features in academic writing (e.g., Casal & Kessler, 2020; Cortes, 2013; Durrant & Mathews-Aydınlı, 2011; Le & Harrington, 2015; Omidian, Shahriari, & Siyanova-Chantura, 2018). Overall, these studies provide important insights into the role that syntactically complex structures play in disciplinary RA writing practices, and they highlight both that writers dynamically vary their use of such structures in the realization of rhetorical and functional goals and that syntactic complexity research is a potentially rich means of analyzing academic registers. Nevertheless, such research tends to emphasize RA introductions over other partgenres, leaving questions regarding writers’ decisions to produce syntactically complex structures over the other major RA part-genres largely unanswered.

More broadly, analyses of RA writing practices from phraseological and lexical perspectives have largely analyzed RAs in their entirety (Cunningham, 2017; Gilmore & Millar, 2018; Gray, 2010; Hyland, 2008; McGrath & Kuteeva, 2012; Valipouri & Nassaji, 2013), and part-genre, which has been the emphasis of a number of rhetorically focused investigations into RA writing practices (e.g., Bruce, 2008, 2009; Hirano, 2009; Jian, 2010; Lim, 2010; Parkinson, 2011; Samraj, 2002, 2005; Yang & Allison, 2003), has generally been adopted as a means of narrowing focus and analyzing specificity, rather than as a point of comparison itself. One notable exception is Martínez (2005), which includes part-genre as one of several focal comparisons of ‘we’ use in RA writing in Biology.

While the considerable attention that genre analysts have dedicated to profiling the linguistic and rhetorical construction of part-genres has highlighted notable conventions of particular part-genres, as well as important trends in disciplinary variation, little is known regarding how the use of syntactically complex structures varies by RA part-genre. This is true in spite of a wide-spread understanding that the rhetorical demands of RA part-genres (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion/Conclusion; IMRD) vary considerably and growing understanding of how writers vary their use of syntactically complex structures according to their rhetorical goals. The insights gained through such analysis is of particular value to the assessment and teaching of academic disciplinary genre writing, as it can both further understandings of the choices that academic disciplinary specialists make regarding the production of syntactically complex structures and provide insights into how such choices vary according to the diverse aims of writers across RA part-genres. This paper responds to these considerations by examining eight previously established measures of syntactic complexity that reflect the multidimensional nature of the complexity construct across IMRD RA part-genres in three social science disciplines.

# 1.1. Research article part-genres

With a strong orientation towards EAP pedagogy and genre theory, a considerable body of EAP scholarship has examined individual RA part-genres within and across disciplinary contexts (e.g., Bruce, 2008, 2009; Cotos, Huffman, & Link, 2017; Hirano, 2009; Jian, 2010; Lim, 2010; Parkinson, 2011; Samraj, 2002, 2005; Yang & Allison, 2003). Much of this scholarship has attended to the rhetorical and linguistic conventions of particular part-genres as a means of identifying the communicative aims of writers, exploring the linguistic means through which such aims are realized, and thus opening windows into disciplinary identities and knowledge-making practices. While it is undeniable that this line of research has contributed considerably to both theoretical and pedagogical endeavors within EAP, it is also true that variation of RA writers’ linguistic choices across part-genres has been the subject of notably fewer studies. Nevertheless, that linguistic differences in RA partgenres exist and are connected to the local rhetorical activity of particular part-genres is hardly controversial, and comparing the rhetorical move frameworks created for individual RA part-genres captures the apparent and striking differences in the rhetorical activity associated with various RA part-genres. Fittingly, Basturkmen (2009) notes that student writers “often struggle to understand the forms and functions of sections of the research report” (p. 242), in spite of the availability of example texts. An understanding that the rhetorical activity, and somehow the language, of RA part-genres diverge can hardly help a novice writer learn to construct a successful text.

Investigations into the rhetorical stages of IMRD part-genres has highlighted their distinct communicative purposes, even as RA part-genres functionally comprise a cohesive contribution, artifact, and practice. It is evident that the Introduction partgenre has received a disproportionate amount of scholarly, and perhaps pedagogical, attention, relative to the other major part-genres. This is likely due practically to the salience and identifiability of Introduction sections as the first portion of RA prose and pragmatically to the difficulties that novice writers often face when synthesizing extant scholarship in which to situate their work. Swales (1990) highlights the importance of ‘situating’ one’s work to effectively “re-establish in the eyes of the discourse community the significance of the research field itself” (p. 142). Other scholars, such as Hirano (2009), effectively support this argument through their findings that other Introduction-oriented rhetorical activity, such as gap-building, is not consistently present across disciplinary (or in this case linguistic) contexts due to community-related characteristics (such as aversion to pointing out weaknesses or gaps in the work of an individual or the overall community). Thus, the rhetorical work of the Introduction is highly interpersonal, as writers construct intertextual networks in which to situate their work.

As Cotos et al. (2017) point out, Methods sections have received comparatively less attention, relative to other part-genres, perhaps due to the highly specialized nature of disciplinary research practices described therein. The authors highlight that previous research on Methods sections had indicated the writing to be “largely factual” (p. 92) in nature, and organized around details, procedures, precedents, and validity. While their cross-disciplinary analysis did reveal the predominant importance of descriptive writing, they also detailed the presence of more abstract social activity, such as contextualizing and building credibility of methods. This suggests that learner and instructor assumptions that Methods sections are more ‘straightforward’ linguistically may obscure important components of effective methodology sections, even while such assumptions may have a basis in the primarily descriptive drive of the part-genre.

Similar to the realization that Methods sections are less uniformly descriptive in nature, there has been considerable discussion regarding the extent to which Results sections are truly characterized by the objective exposition of results and reporting of facts, with many scholars noting that commenting on results is acceptable within the Results sections, and that “this appears to be a widespread practice in RAs across disciplines” (Yang & Allison, 2003, p. 381). Thompson (1993) highlights that authors of Biochemistry RA results sections, for example, comment on findings within the Results sections to justify methodological decisions, make interpretations regarding the meaning of findings, evaluate the quality of the data itself, make external comparisons to extant work, highlight or explain discrepancies in findings, or note findings which are difficult to explain, while Yang and Allison note a more general trend of commenting on results within Applied Linguistics. Nonetheless, the authors conclude that Results and Discussions sections “differ in terms of primary communicative purpose” (p. 390). Parkinson (2011) furthers this line of argumentation by differentiating between the “proof of the data,” which is associated with the Results section activity, and the Discussion section “proof of the claim” (p. 174), which is more argumentbased and abstract in nature. Further, Parkinson notes that student writers struggled in particular with the linguistic features that enable the “journey from data to claim” (p. 174). Underscoring the pedagogical importance of RA part-genre comparisons. Basturkmen (2009) notes the particular need for “bringing together parts of the research project to meld content from the literature review with the design and results of the study at hand” (p. 242), in essence bridging the other three major partgenres into the argumentative ‘proof of claim’ that advances new disciplinary knowledge.

While these and other authors have made significant contributions to our understanding of part-genre writing practices, few direct comparisons of the linguistic conventions of part-genres exist. Part-genre comparisons represent a feasible basis for analysis of text-internal linguistic variation in disciplinary writing practices, given the lack of large, freely available moveannotated corpora of complete RA texts and the considerable manual effort involved in such an endeavor. Already, recent analyses have revealed part-genre internal variation in writers’ decisions to produce syntactically complex structures (e.g., Lu, Casal, & Liu, 2020; Casal, 2020), as will be discussed in the following section.

# 1.2. Syntactic complexity in English for academic purposes writing research

Definitions of syntactic complexity in writing research emphasize both the range and the sophistication of utilized syntactic structures (Housen & Kuiken, 2009; Lu, 2011; Ortega, 2003), and within research on second language writing, particular emphasis has been placed on syntactic complexity as a means of analyzing language proficiency and developmental trajectories (e.g., Biber et al., 2016; Crossley & McNamara, 2014; Kyle & Crossley, 2018; Norris & Ortega, 2009; Ortega, 2003). However, particularly over the past decade and since Biber and Gray’s (2010) important arguments regarding the value of analyzing written academic genres through the lens of phrasal complexity (and particularly noun phrase complexity), the role of syntactic complexity in research on academic writing practices has expanded, with considerable attention paid to L2 English writers of academic genres (e.g., Ansarifar et al., 2018; Casal & Lee, 2019; Lu & Ai, 2015; Mazgutova & Kormos, 2015; Parkinson & Musgrave, 2014; Staples & Reppen, 2016).

A large body of scholarship on the complexity of L2 English writers exists, but far fewer studies have provided insights into the use of syntactically complex structures in English language writing practices of target disciplinary communities. When disciplinary communities are included in such analyses, they often represent a point of comparison as a target for developing writers. For example, Ansarifar et al. (2018) conducted a graduate student-expert writer comparison in the production of complex noun phrases in abstract writing in which they found significant differences in noun phrase modification across MA, PhD, and ‘expert’ writer populations. In their dataset, they uncovered that PhD and expert RA abstract writers used more noun, participle, adjective, and prepositional noun modifiers than MA students, but expert RA abstract writers used only prepositional noun modifiers in significantly greater abundance than PhD writers. These findings underscore the importance of noun phrase modification in academic writing practices and the potential usefulness of including a focus on noun phrases in EAP writing pedagogy, highlighting the importance of examining the use of complex noun phrases and other complex structures in other academic genres.

In a more recent analysis, Wu, Mauranen, & Lei, 2020 divided disciplinary experts into L1 and L2 English groups and compared RA manuscripts produced by English as a Lingua Franca writers with those produced by American English writers along 14 measures of syntactic complexity (representing the multidimensional nature of the syntactic complexity construct). Their findings revealed that ELF writers created longer sentences with more coordinate phrases and complex nominals than their American English counterparts. Wu et al. outline the potential value of these findings for addressing disadvantages that ELF research writers may face and provide useful insights into how ELF writers often utilize different linguistic structures for the creation of similar meanings. While these findings do reveal differences in the syntactic complexity of research writing within academic writing communities, the divisions are not along disciplinary boundaries, but rather L1 boundaries. Both

Ansarifar et al. (2018) and Wu, Mauranen, & Lei, 2020 provide insights into syntactic complexity variation within academic writing practices, but neither adopt a cross-disciplinary perspective to examine the community-specific genre conventions in the use of syntactically complex structure.

More to this aim, Lu et al. (2020) and Casal (2020) included analysis of text internal variation in their cross-disciplinary analysis of syntactic complexity in published RA Introductions. Lu et al. (2020) found significant differences across five syntactic complexity measures (mean length of sentence, nominalization density, finite dependent clauses per sentence, nonfinite dependent clauses per sentence, and sentence left-embeddedness) in the rhetorical functions associated with the most complex sentences (according to internally defined thresholds) in a mixed corpus of 600 Social Science RA Introductions. In summary, these findings indicate important differences in how writers employ syntactically complex structures variably even within a single part-genre. Similarly, Casal (2020) found significant, large effects of both discipline and rhetorical move on four measures of syntactic complexity (mean length of sentence, complex nominal density, nominalization density, and left-embeddedness) in a corpus of 400 RA introductions from Applied Linguistics, Chemical Engineering, Economics, and Electrical Engineering. Both studies indicated that writers vary their use of syntactically complex structures according to their functional aims, and Casal (2020) also found strong disciplinary tendencies.

These findings once more point towards text internal variation in the use of syntactically complex structures, but they also highlight disciplinary variation in such linguistic choices. However, both of these analyses have emphasized the introductions of RAs, leaving notable space for cross part-genre analysis of the use of syntactically complex structures. Such an investigation will contribute to genre analysis by further considering the ways in which academic research article writing conventions vary linguistically across part-genre, as well as how such variability may be discipline specific.

# 1.3. The present study

The present study contributes to the body of scholarship which analyzes the syntactic features of and part-genre differences in research article writing practices within and across disciplinary contexts by examining disciplinary and part-genre differences in syntactic complexity (eight measures following Jin, Lu, & Ni, 2020; Yang et al., 2015) in a corpus of 240 social science research articles. It is motivated by the following research questions.

1. Are there significant differences in the syntactic complexity, as assessed from eight established measures, of research articles across the three analyzed disciplines?   
2. Are there significant differences in the syntactic complexity, as assessed from eight established measures, of research article part-genres?

# 2. Materials and methods

# 2.1. The corpus

The corpus consists of a 240-text subset of the Corpus of Social Sciences Research Articles (COSSRA), with 80 published RAs each from Applied Linguistics, Economics, and Psychology. Previous scholarship has uncovered clear disciplinary differences in the linguistic and rhetorical conventions of research article writing practices when traditionally ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ disciplines are compared (e.g., Basturkmen, 2012; Bruce, 2009; Cotos et al., 2017), as well as when sub-disciplinary fields are compared (e.g., 11 sub-disciplines of Civil Engineering in Gilmore & Millar, 2018). The emphasis on social sciences in the present study reflects an attempt to select distinct disciplinary communities while at the same time limiting topic variability at a macro level through the broad focus on human behavior.

Within each discipline, texts were selected from five top-tier, non-niche journals (according to impact factor and expert member checking) evenly across the years of 2012e2016, inclusive. The texts were stored in UTF-8 format and segmented into IMRD part-genres following section labels when possible and content when necessary. A small number of texts in Applied Linguistics contained combined results and discussion sections, and those texts were excluded from the analysis and replaced with other texts from the larger COSSRA corpus. The introductions had been processed for syntactic complexity analysis by a team of seven researchers as part of previous research on the COSSRA corpus, and the researchers applied the same procedures to the processing of the remaining part-genres. This involved manual segmentation of texts into constituent part-genres, removal of journal tags, page numbers, parenthetical components of citation, replacing non-English/alphabetic characters with comparable English alphabet forms, correction of textual issues that arose from conversion from. pdf to UTF-8 format, and replacing formulas with the label ‘FORMULA’ when embedded within prose. Tables, which were common across all three disciplines and contained mostly numeric and phrasal elements, were removed from the corpus as well. These modifications were made as minimally as possible with the syntactic parsing methods employed by the automated complexity analyzer in mind. The corpus is described in more depth in Table 1, and it includes over 2 million words overall with a somewhat even distribution across disciplinary and part-genre sub-corpora. The Economics Results sub-corpus is an exception, as it is more than double the length of results sections in Psychology and Applied Linguistics.

# 2.2. Syntactic complexity analysis

Values for each of the eight syntactic complexity measures were calculated using an adapted version of the Syntactic Complexity Analyzer (SCA; Lu, 2010), which is a freely available automatic syntactic complexity analyzer. The SCA tallies words, sentences, clauses, dependent clauses, T-units, complex T-units, coordinated phrases, complex nominals, and verb phrases, which are used in the reliable calculation of 14 indices. High F-scores (0.916) were reported for all structural elements except for complex nominals (0.83) in the manual validity assessments conducted as part of Lu (2010), and Yoon and Polio (2017) similarly reported high correlations between the SCA and human annotators (0.81) for 11 of the 12 measures evaluated. Importantly, these assessments were conducted on L2 English writing samples, where learner errors may have resulted in more inaccuracies and disparities than in published RA text.

Syntactic complexity analysis targeted eight previously established measures based on Yang et al.’s (2015) hierarchical representation of syntactic complexity and their non-redundant operationalizations of each complexity sub-construct (see also Jin et al., 2020). Fig. 1, reproduced from Yang et al. demonstrates these eight component sub-constructs and the complexity index through which it is measured, with the terminal nodes representing “nonoverlapping discrete subconstructs” and nonterminal nodes representing “composites of discrete subconstructs” (Jin et al. p. 197). These measures and basic calculation procedures are presented in Table 2. Importantly, while the original SCA (2010) adopted a broader definition of complex nominal phrases, based on Cooper (1976), the current study defines complex noun phrases as noun phrases that contain pre-modifying adjectives, post-modifying prepositional phrases, and post-modifying appositives, following the work of Biber, Gray, and Poonpon (2011) and in line with Jin et al. (2020) and Yang et al. (2015). This is a narrower approach to defining complex nominals, but other complex noun phrase structures (e.g., relative clauses) are represented in other included measures. The LCA does not directly report the non-finite elements per clause, but this was calculated using the LCA output by subtracting one from the verb phrase measure per clause “since by definition a clause contains one finite VP, and the other VPs are therefore non-finite” (Yang et al., 2015, p. 59). Further discussion of and motivation for the syntactic complexity subconstructs, descriptions and examples of the established indices, and the calculations for each individual index are presented in both Yang et al. (2015) and Jin et al. (2020).

# 2.3. Statistical analysis

To examine the interaction of discipline and part-genre on syntactic complexity, a two-way MANOVA was conducted with discipline and part-genre as independent variables and the eight complexity measures as dependent variables. Follow-up MANOVAs and ANOVAs are reported in the results section. To examine disciplinary variation in syntactic complexity (RQ1), a one-way MANOVA was conducted with discipline as the independent variable and the eight complexity measures as dependent variables. To examine part-genre variation in syntactic complexity (RQ2), a one-way MANOVA was conducted with part-genre as the independent variable and the eight complexity measures as dependent variables. Follow-up ANOVAs with Tamhane’s T2 post-hoc comparisons were conducted to further examine significant results, and all inferential statistics are presented in the Results section. The Levene test indicated that the data fails to meet the homogeneity of variance assumption among the three disciplines and four part-genres. Given that we had a relatively large sample with equal group sizes, we proceeded with our analyses using Pillai’s trace, which is more robust than Wilk’s Lambda when the assumption of homogeneity of variance is violated, and Tamhane’s T2 post hoc tests, which do not assume homogeneity of variances across groups (Field, 2017). These statistical tests were carried out through SPSS 27.

# 3. Results

A two-way MANOVA revealed significant effects for discipline (Pillai’s Trace $= 0 . 3 7 3$ , $\mathrm { F } ( 1 6 , 1 8 8 4 ) = 2 7 . 0 2 2$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $\boldsymbol \eta _ { \mathsf { p } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 8 7 )$ , part-genre (Pillai’s Trace $= 0 . 5 3 6$ , $\vec { \cdot } ( 2 4 , 2 8 2 9 ) = 2 5 . 6 3 8$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $\boldsymbol \eta _ { \mathsf { p } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 7 9 $ , and the interaction between both variables (Pillai’s T $\mathbf { \dot { r a c e } } = 0 . 1 6 4$ , $\operatorname { F } ( 4 8 , 5 6 7 6 ) = 3 . 3 2 8$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $\boldsymbol \eta _ { \mathrm { p } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 2 7 )$ . Following Cohen’s (1988) guidelines for interpreting $\boldsymbol \eta _ { \mathsf { p } } ^ { 2 }$ effect sizes, the effects of discipline and part-genre are large $( \eta _ { \mathrm { p } } ^ { 2 } > 0 . 1 4 )$ , and the effect of the interaction of discipline and part-genre is small $( 0 . 0 6 > \eta _ { \mathrm { p } } ^ { 2 } > 0 . { \overset { \mathrm { . } } { 0 } } 1 )$ . To further explore the effect of discipline and part-genre on the syntactic complexity of social sciences research articles in eight measures, a series of follow-up ANOVA tests with pairwise post-hoc comparisons were conducted to explore significant results.

# 3.1. By discipline

As previously reported, the two-way MANOVA yielded a significant result for the impact of discipline on syntactic complexity (Pillai’s Trace $= 0 . 3 7 3$ , F(16, $1 8 8 4 ) = 2 7 . 0 2 2$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $\Upsilon _ { \mathsf { p } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 8 7 )$ , with the effect size being interpreted as large (Cohen, 1988). To more closely analyze disciplinary variation in the eight measure of syntactic complexity, a series of followup ANOVAs were conducted with discipline as the independent variable and each of the eight measures as the dependent variable of a separate test. No significant between-group differences were found in terms of TU/S $\operatorname { F } ( 2 , 9 6 0 ) = 1 . 7 7 3$ , $p = . 1 7 0$ , $\boldsymbol \eta _ { \mathsf { p } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 4 )$ . Table 3 summarizes the pair-wise comparisons.

# 3.2. By part-genre

As previously reported, the two-way MANOVA yielded a significant result for the impact of part-genre on syntactic complexity (Pillai’s Trace $= 0 . 5 3 6$ , F $( 2 4 , 2 8 2 9 ) = 2 5 . 6 3 8$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $\boldsymbol \eta _ { \mathsf { p } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 1 7 9 )$ , with the effect size being interpreted as large (Cohen, 1988). In order to more closely analyze part-genre variation in the eight measure of syntactic complexity, a series of follow-up ANOVAs were conducted with part-genre as the independent variable and each of the eight measures as the dependent variable of a separate test. No significant between-group differences were found in terms of MLC $( \mathrm { F } ( 3 , 9 6 0 ) = 1 . 7 8 1$ , $p = . 1 4 9$ , $\boldsymbol \eta _ { \mathrm { p } } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 0 0 6 \boldsymbol \theta$ .

# 4. Discussion

Overall, notable patterns emerge from these findings at both the disciplinary and part-genre level. Broadly speaking, there was a clear and important separation between writers’ choices to produce text which was complex along eight examined measures across disciplinary and part-genre variables. Applied Linguistics texts were generally the most complex, while Economics texts were generally the least complex, which suggests broad disciplinary writing tendencies that warrant further examination. With regard to part-genre, Introductions and Discussion sections emerged as significantly more complex than Results and Methods sections overall. This may be attributed at least in part to the more descriptive nature of Methods and Results sections, which are more oriented around reporting, than the more interpretive and somewhat more abstract Introduction and Discussion sections, which connect findings to a broader research community. It should be noted that these comparisons are corpus-internal, and thus do not suggest that Economics writing, Results part-genres, or Methods partgenres are not complex linguistically. The existence of large-scale and significant differences in the syntactic complexity of RA part-genres and disciplinary RA texts overall was rather unsurprising. However, the clarity of disciplinary and part-genre differences in syntactic complexity were somewhat more surprising, not in the fact that differences existed, but in the consistency of both disciplinary and part-genre complexity rankings.

Across four complexity measures (overall sentence complexity, overall T-unit complexity, elaboration at clause level, and complex noun phrases per clause), Applied Linguistics writers employed syntactically complex structures significantly more frequently than writers in other disciplines, and Economics writers employed significantly fewer syntactically complex structures than writers in other disciplines. For two measures, non-finite subordination and phrasal coordination, Psychology demonstrated significantly higher levels than Economics, and Economics showed the highest levels only for finite clausal subordination, which was significantly higher in Economics than Psychology. Thus, Applied Linguistics was the most complex across five of the eight measures (four by significant margins), and ranked second in the remaining three, indicating that Applied Linguistics RA writing was more complex across the assessed dimensions of syntactic complexity. Inversely, Economics writing was the lowest in seven of the eight assessed complexity measures (six at significant levels), and was only high relative to other disciplines in terms of one measure, indicating that Economics writing is characterized overall by lower levels of complexity, relative to the other social science disciplines, across the assessed dimensions of complexity. These trends highlight considerable degrees of disciplinary variation, even within the broad ‘Social Sciences’ label, which further reinforces the importance of discipline specificity in genre analysis and academic register studies (Hyland & Tse, 2009).

Future research can adopt qualitative approaches to examine features of disciplinary discourse practices that may shed insights into the disciplinary complexity profiles that have emerged to provide insights into why such clear differences may arise. Such investigations may target how disciplinary identities and knowledge-making practices are strongly intertwined with the linguistic decisions of writers. For example, Casal (2020) also found that Applied Linguistics trended towards high levels of complexity and Economics towards lower levels across the assessed measures in RA Introductions in an analysis which included two Engineering disciplines. This suggests that these disciplinary differences detected here exist beyond social sciences. As is discussed below, Casal (2020) attributed differences in both the frequency that particular syntactically complex structures were utilized across disciplinary contexts and the degree of complexity of such structures to differences in propositional focus. However, due to the emphasis on a single part-genre and the differences in complexity indices, the explanations offered as a result of Casal (2020) qualitative analysis cannot be used to interpret the present findings.

The part-genre based comparisons present a more measure-to-measure picture of differences in syntactic complexity, but a broad separation between Introduction and Discussion part-genres on the significantly high end and Results and Methods part-genres on the significantly low end emerged. Introductions and Discussions are significantly more complex than the other part-genres in five of the eight measures (non-finite elements, overall sentence complexity, overall T-unit complexity, finite clausal subordination, and noun-phrase complexity), with Introductions demonstrating significantly higher levels of noun-phrase complexity than Discussion sections and also significantly higher levels of a sixth measure, phrasal coordination, than the other disciplines. Thus, it appears that a wide range of complex structures offer important affordances to RA writers in Introduction writing, which scholars have associated with high levels of intertextual synthesis and situation of one’s work within a broader disciplinary context (e.g., Hirano, 2009; Swales, 1990) and Discussion writing, which authors have associated with building claims up from data and, once more, connecting them to broader disciplinary knowledge (Parkinson, 2011). In spite of the important recognition that scholars have given Methods sections and Results sections for moving beyond description and objective reporting, respectively (Cotos et al., 2017; Thompson, 1991), it is apparent that the syntactic complexity profiles of these part-genres, and in particular Methods sections, trend towards lower complexity values.

Based on these findings, we suggest that qualitatively based research into the connections between syntactically complex structures and the propositional/rhetorical aims of RA writers across part-genres is likely to reveal important insights into the motivations of disciplinary writers to produce ‘complex’ structures in academic writing. For example, in Casal (2020), a rhetorical move analysis of Introductions allowed the author to connect the lower complexity values of Economics at least in part to the extensive topic overview information which was present in many Economics Introductions, as it was discovered in that corpus that Economics texts within a single journal issue may be more methodologically similar than topically similar. Similarly, the author noticed a strong connection between the industry-oriented discussions of methodological processes in Chemical Engineering Introductions with a higher use of nominalizations. However, that study adopted Introductions as a focal point, which allowed for a manual qualitative analysis of the corpus. While manual analysis of 400 RA Introductions is a considerable undertaking, a complete qualitative analysis across all RA part-genres fell outside of the scope of the present study. Thus, the present findings suggest a broader discipline-specific convention. Investigation into the propositional and topical factors that may contribute to this disciplinary profile may prove to be valuable contributions to Economics-specific EAP writing pedagogies, much as other discipline specific investigations. Regarding part-genre differences, we speculate broadly that the part-genre divisions in syntactic complexity across the eight measures can be connected to the work of other scholars who have examined the rhetorical and functional aims of IMRD sections. In particular, the more descriptive, realworld nature of methodology and results sections (which outline practices and outcomes, respectively) can be potentially accepted as a factor in their relatively lower levels of syntactic complexity than Introductions and Discussions, which require more socially oriented, synthesis and knowledge-production based argumentation. Similarly, future research can adopt additional measures of syntactic complexity (e.g., those recommended by Biber, Gray, Staples, & Egbert, 2020) to examine the variable complexity of research article writing practices across part-genre boundaries and disciplinary boundaries.

From a pedagogical perspective, a number of important implications arise from the current analysis. Broadly speaking, that such disciplinary and part-genre based differences exist is, at a macro level, useful knowledge for an EAP writing instructor regardless of the extent to which they explicitly instruct learners on the production of these structures. Biber and Gray (2010) note the assumptions that researchers hold regarding academic writing (many which do not hold up to analysis), and Casal and Lu (2021) show that EAP student writers also carry strong assumptions regarding the ways and degree to which academic writing is generally ‘complex.’ Broad awareness that academic research writing is variably, rather than uniformly, complex, and that such variability may occur across disciplinary research writing practices and across part-genre boundaries within a text represents a useful basis for designing pedagogical activities, helping learners shape realistic goals, and providing feedback on student writing decisions.

Additionally, a number of potential paths towards bringing the findings of this and other syntactic complexity analyses into a pedagogical EAP context exist. Some linguistic features, such as complex noun phrases, have been shown widely to be characteristic of academic writing practices (e.g., Biber and Gray, 2010), and thus warrant consideration for explicit inclusion in an EAP writing syllabus. Casal and Lu (2021) included focused ‘complex noun phrase’ instruction in a doctoral level EAP writing course for students from twelve disciplines (targeting both the forms and functional affordances of such structures), and assessment of the pedagogical intervention revealed both differences in student writing and high learner reported confidence for EAP writing and reading. For complex noun phrases, these complexity-focused activities can include grammatical discussion of how noun phrases are built up into complex structures, as well as text-analysis activities targeting the frequency and functional affordances of such features.

Regarding more global measures of complexity, it may be rightly argued that such measures may be more difficult to teach due to the large number of structures and choices that may lead to particular types of complexity, such as mean length of sentence. Certainly ‘producing long sentences’ is unlikely to make its way onto an EAP writing syllabus. On the other hand, we argue that choices regarding sentence length are clearly a reality in the minds of writers across academic disciplines, and there is considerable value in examining, from a scholarly perspective and with learners in pedagogical contexts, the reasons why writers may ‘push the limits’ (e.g., dense ‘Announcing the aim of the present paper’ statements; see Casal, 2020; Lu et al., 2020) and the parts of a text where such longer sentences may be more appropriate. Thus, more global perspectives on complexity (e.g., length of sentence, number of clauses in a sentence) may be featured as part of text-analysis activities common to EAP writing course which already orient learners towards reflection on the discipline specific functional aims of writers in the selection of particular linguistic structures. Together, a package of complexity measures and a variety of complex structures can be useful analyzed in tandem to address complexity at a broader pedagogical level by raising awareness of the ways in which academic research writing may be called complex, as well as the motivations for implementing e or avoiding e such structures in particular contexts.

Therefore, the implications of these findings are more ideally oriented towards instructor knowledge, such that principled feedback may be offered on relevant issues and learners can be prodded to consider such matters during discussions, analysis, and reflection on writing. Of course, it is unreasonable to expect all measures of syntactic complexity to reveal disciplinary and part-genre differences or text-internal variation according to a writer’s functional aims. In the present study, for example clausal coordination, which has been a more productive measure for describing low proficiency English learners, was unsurprisingly not a useful means of differentiating disciplinary texts. And yet, that such variability across disciplinary and part-genre boundaries exists across such a wide set of features suggests that pedagogical attention to complexity in academic research writing is warranted. The clear disciplinary differences uncovered here underscore the importance of discipline specificity in EAP writing instruction, although this does not necessarily point towards the separation of learners into discipline specific courses. Rather, such pedagogies should be sensitive to the disciplinary variability of writing practices and provide space for work with writing within one’s target discipline. The clear part-genre differences uncovered in the present study underscore the importance of considering the functional aims and affordances of particular linguistic features, rather than considering them as chiefly ‘academic’ or characteristic of a broad genre or disciplinary practice.

Ultimately, such discussions and pedagogical foci can provide learners with both sophisticated grammatical/linguistic knowledge and useful decision-making processes which are based on a socially and functionally-based perspective on what they are doing with their writing, as well as how a reader may respond. To be sure, instruction of micro level grammatical features is of paramount importance for developing the linguistic repertoire of L2 academic writers, but the clausal and sentence level conventions of how discourse is built up from these features into more complex and variable units of language is also worthy of instructional attention. Learners make decisions at all linguistic levels, and they are thus likely to have doubts and benefit from instruction which cuts across them.

# 5. Conclusions

Overall, this analysis has uncovered important disciplinary and part-genre based differences in the use of syntactically complex structures in disciplinary genre practices. It reinforces previous scholarship promoting discipline specificity and the aptness of examining and teaching part-genres both as constituents of a larger entity and as of individual nature themselves. There is considerable room for expansion of the present study, particularly in broadening the disciplinary focus beyond three social science disciplines and in explicitly targeting hybrid or non-traditional part-genres, such as combined ResultsDiscussion sections. Future research can, in the absence of large move-annotated corpora, extend this present part-genre and discipline-based comparison of syntactic complexity to include additional complexity measures and other linguistic resources (e.g., metadiscourse markers, reporting verbs, formulaic sequences). Including rhetorical or functional analysis with such quantitative approaches is likely to provide the most useful insights into the role of complex structures in disciplinary knowledge-making practices. We also highlight that future research can examine the potential effectiveness of explicit instruction in the function-specific use of syntactically complex structures, which may go a long way towards further countering the myths of complexity in RA writing practices that Biber and Gray (2010) challenged. Clearly, academic writing is both linguistically and propositionally complex, but there is further room for analysis of the ways in which it is complex, and especially into what is afforded to academic writers (and therefore L2 and novice academic writers) by producing syntactically complex structures.
