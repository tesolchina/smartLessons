# ABSTRACT

Children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) show a wide range of impairments, including poor pre-reading skills and decoding difficulties due to phonological deficits and such difficulties have significant repercussions on the acquisition of written language. However, evidence about reading processes and development is mainly available for English-speaking children with DLD, limiting our understanding of this process in a cross-linguistic manner. The orthographic characteristics of languages significantly influence the learning process of written code. Unlike English, Brazilian Portuguese has a transparent decoding system and its orthography presents a set of consistent, univocal grapheme-phoneme relations. The present study investigated whether the challenges reported in decoding for children with DLD in opaque languages hold for children with DLD who are speakers of Brazilian Portuguese and whether the length and type of stimuli influence the decoding skills of children with DLD differently than when compared to children with typical language development (TLD). Sixteen children with DLD between seven and ten years of age who are monolingual speakers of Brazilian Portuguese and 64 controls with TLD matched by gender, age, and socioeconomic status, with the children with DLD in a 4:1 ratio; participated in the study. All children performed a computerized task where they were asked to decode a linguistically balanced list of words and nonwords designed according to Brazilian Portuguese decoding rules. The present study provides substantial evidence that children with DLD who are speakers of Brazilian Portuguese have deficits in the acquisition of decoding and that the decoding profile of children with DLD is subject to multiple influences, not only with relation to the length and type of stimuli but also characteristics of the languages these children are being literate in, highlighting the multifactorial nature involved in the development of decoding.

# 1. Introduction

Developmental language disorder (DLD) is characterized by significant alterations in language development not associated with known biomedical etiology, socio-environmental factors, or multilingualism (e.g., Bishop et al. 2017, MacGregor 2020). Phonological impairment is an essential feature of DLD, including deficits in phonological processing, such as short-term phonological memory and phonological awareness (Befi-Lopes et al. 2012, 2022; Broc et al. 2021; Snowling & Hulme 2021). Phonological processing is responsible for the ability to analyze the sound structure of speech, retention of information, and quick access to phonological representations of the language (Snowling et al. 2016), which are fundamental skills for the literacy process (Van den Boer et al.

2014, Schoenel et al. 2020). Children with DLD show a wide range of impairments in preschool years, including poor pre-reading skills and decoding difficulties due to phonological deficits (De Bree et al. 2022, Catts et al. 2002) and such difficulties have significant repercussions on the acquisition of written language (Befi-Lopes et al. 2022). Considering languages differ in orthography and DLD shows different manifestations in different languages, it is fundamental to extend the scope of knowledge to other languages. The current study focuses on Brazilian Portuguese, a language that has not been well studied.

It is estimated that a considerable proportion of children with DLD present word decoding difficulties (between $3 1 \%$ and $7 2 \%$ ) (De Bree et al. 2022), and decoding outcomes of children with DLD are generally poorer than those of their peers with typical language development (TLD) (e.g., Catts et al. 2008, Francis et al. 2019, Rojas et al. 2019). A recent study with Brazilian children with DLD (Befi-Lopes et al. 2022) showed evidence that chronological age is not a good predictor of phonological awareness skills in this population, but rather linguistic age is a good predictor, reiterating the influence of oral language deficits in DLD. Because of underlying language difficulties, reading comprehension is expected to pose a particular challenge for these children later in development. Catts et al. (2002) reported that $4 8 \%$ of their sample of children with language difficulties in kindergarten had reading comprehension problems, whereas decoding skills evolved with intervention.

There is a growing number of studies on the literacy skills of children with DLD, as well as the importance of their characterization for making differential diagnoses concerning specific learning disorders, such as dyslexia, and even the co-occurrence of these conditions (Snowling et al. 2020, 2021; Snowling & Hulme 2021). Snowling & Hulme (2021) point out that children with DLD have difficulties with oral language comprehension, decoding, and reading comprehension. In contrast, children with dyslexia tend to present oral language skills preserved, impairment in decoding acquisition and development, and minor problems in reading comprehension. For the most part, DLD and dyslexia have been researched, identified, and treated separately. Numerous studies have been conducted to independently examine causal mechanisms and identify characteristics that could serve as clinical markers of each disorder (Leonard 2014, Rice & Hoffman 2015, Lyon et al. 2003, Vellutino et al. 2004). Whereas DLD affects multiple aspects of language at the word, sentence, and discourse levels, grammatical difficulties, particularly with tense and agreement marking, have received the most attention as a clinical marker (e.g., Leonard 2014, Rice & Hoffman 2015) for monolingual children and nonword repetition difficulties for bilingual children (e.g., De Anda and Friend 2020). In contrast, the core deficits of dyslexia involve phonological processing (e.g., Lyon et al. 2003), which interferes with the mapping of phonemes to graphemes that is necessary for decoding new words and, thereby playing a causal role in dyslexia (Vellutino et al. 2004). Nonetheless, studies have shown that dyslexia and DLD have shared deficits in phonological processing, placing children with both disorders at risk of poor reading development. In dyslexia, the most significant phonological deficit is phonological awareness, or the ability to manipulate the speech sounds of a language. In DLD, in addition to problems with grammar, word learning, and semantic processing, children frequently display difficulty in tasks involving short-term phonological memory (Gathercole & Baddeley 1993) and phonological awareness (Catts 1993, Snowling et al. 2021). The shared deficits led some researchers to question whether DLD and dyslexia were, in fact, distinct disorders or different manifestations of the same underlying deficit (Bishop & Snowling 2004, Kamhi & Catts 1986, McArthur et al. 2000). A large-scale longitudinal study published in 2002 was a pioneer in providing strong evidence that the two disorders are, in fact, separable (Catts et al. 2002). That study had a sample of over 500 kindergarten students who were followed through eighth grade. The children were classified based on a comprehensive language assessment in kindergarten and word reading evaluations in the second, fourth, and eighth grades. There was wide variation in the language skills of children with dyslexia and the word reading skills of children with DLD, such that some children with disorders in one domain had quite strong skills in the other. Furthermore, DLD and dyslexia show different developmental paths concerning difficulties in the early stages of reading development (Snowling et al. 2021). In DLD, differently than in dyslexia, phonological difficulties generally decrease over time, whereas reading comprehension difficulties persist. However, not all children with DLD are poor readers (De Bree et al. 2022), and children whose language difficulties resolve by the time of formal reading instruction are less likely to experience decoding difficulties than those whose language difficulties persist into the school years (Snowling et al. 2021). This heterogeneity in reading and decoding skills of the DLD population is challenging for educational and clinical practices.

# 1.1 Reading development and dual route theory

Reading is a complex skill dependent on multiple linguistic-cognitive abilities, which, interdependently, result in the proper processing of decoded information (Pritchard et al. 2018, Liebig et al. 2017, Wise Younger et al. 2017). Two routes, phonological and lexical, are responsible for reading acquisition and development (Seidenberg 1993, Pritchard et al. 2018, Liebig et al. 2017, Wise Younger et al. 2017). Proficient reading is only reached when decoding is automatized and cognitive and metacognitive mechanisms are available to understand the decoded material (Malins et al. 2017, Grainger et al. 2016). The phonological route uses the grapheme-phoneme conversion process, translating letters or groups of letters into phonemes by applying grapheme-phonemic rules. In contrast, on the lexical route, pronunciation is not constructed segment by segment but retrieved from the orthographic lexicon. The lexical route is used only when the item to be read has its orthographic representation pre-stored in the orthographic lexicon; that is, it was acquired through the phonological route (Pritchard et al. 2018, Liebig et al. 2017, Wise Younger et al. 2017, Malins et al. 2017, Grainger et al. 2016). Thus, the development and automation of the decoding process are fundamental for good literacy (Pritchard et al. 2018, Liebig et al. 2017, Wise Younger et al. 2017, Malins et al. 2017, Grainger et al. 2016). In the acquisition and development of decoding, there is a transition from slow reading, based on the grapheme-phoneme relationship, to rapid and assertive word recognition. This indicates a preference in the use of the lexical over the phonological route (Malins et al. 2017, Grainger et al. 2016). Thus, phonological decoding is essential for developing automatic visual recognition of words, a critical skill for reading fluency. Initially, phonological decoding is responsible for familiarizing the novice reader with orthographic representations necessary for fluent and effortless decoding. It is important to emphasize, however, that this process occurs gradually, and the transition from the use of the phonological to the lexical route occurs throughout the development of reading and does not end with literacy (Malins et al. 2017, Grainger et al. 2016).

In the early 2000s, studies were carried out to increase understanding of the dual-route model. Coltheart et al. (2001) described a computer program that simulated different word and nonword recognition possibilities by different reading routes. The authors described other operating models for that program’s phonological and lexical routes, known as Dual-Route Cascaded Model. According to that model, when faced with a word, the individual already performs the word’s phonological mapping (sound recognition), even if the reader must complete the visual recognition thoroughly. In the lexical route, the orthographic representations would present different levels of recognition. This route could be activated by letters or a combination of letters, not just by the whole word. Thus, small fragments of words could activate the lexical route, however, impacting the phonological route. The authors also claimed that the lexical and phonological routes would not cancel each other out but would work together; the fact that a word is identified by one or the other route would not nullify the activation of similar orthographic and phonological structures in both routes. Later studies were carried out, and the Dual-Route Cascaded Model has been demonstrating tests of different natures that would explain the typical processing model of decoding and its alterations (Coltheart et al. 2001; Pritchard et al. 2012, 2018). Researchers have described several processes replicated by the model that adequately explain and reproduce manifestations, symptoms, and alterations presented by different reading pathologies, such as developmental dyslexia and those acquired after encephalic injury.

# 1.2 Word-reading assessment

Word reading is a crucial skill for literacy and for consolidating fluent reading and, consequently, reading comprehension (Turkyılmaz et al. 2014). The assessment of decoding through read-aloud is currently the most frequently used measure to monitor the acquisition and progress of the skill, both concerning school assessments and to verify the effectiveness of intervention programs (Proença et al. 2017, Carter et al. 2015). In addition, the results of the oral decoding assessments are significant predictors of future reading performance of the individual. The oral reading of isolated words is the most frequently used task to assess the individual’s proficiency in decoding (Proença et al. 2017, Carter et al. 2015). This task isolates context or visual (pictorial) cues and thus strictly evaluates decoding and is firmly based on the dual-route model, including words and nonwords.

# 1.3 Reading skills and DLD in languages other than English

The literature consistently reports diminished reading performance among monolingual children with DLD who speak various languages (Coloma et al. 2020 [Spanish], 2016; Brizzolara et al. 2011 [Italian]; Nithart et al. 2009 [French]). However, evidence about reading processes and development is mainly available for English-speaking children with DLD (Brizzolara et al. 2011). The orthographic characteristics of each language significantly influence the learning process of written code (Katz & Frost 1992, Defior et al. 2002 [European Portuguese and Spanish], Lallier et al. 2014 [French and Spanish]). Writing systems represent the phonology of languages with different degrees of consistency and the relationship between phonemes and graphemes in a language can facilitate or hinder the acquisition and development of reading depending on the degree of transparency (a single grapheme represents a phoneme and vice versa) or opacity (a phoneme is represented by more than one grapheme and vice versa) (Mallins et al. 2016, Grainger et al. 2016, Ziegler & Goswami 2005). English is an orthographically opaque language, allowing a somewhat inconsistent mapping between sounds and graphemes. Children exposed to transparent languages might learn to decode at a more effortless and faster pace than children speaking opaque languages (Catts 2008), and differential diagnosis and treatment plans are, therefore, necessary. A child with DLD may find it easier to learn reading and writing in an orthographically transparent language than a child with DLD who must learn to decode orthographic systems characterized by highly inconsistent spelling to sound relationships.

Coloma et al. (2020) argue that research on reading-related problems among children with DLD who speak Spanish, a transparent language, is exceedingly less abundant than the research on Englishspeaking children with DLD, even though Spanish is the fourth most spoken language in the world. Studies involving Spanish-speaking children with DLD have focused on reading profiles, the development of reading comprehension and decoding processes, and determining which linguistic dimensions better predict decoding and reading comprehension. The limited studies in Spanish support the view that while reading comprehension problems persist over time, decoding issues tend to be transient (Aguilar-Mediavilla et al. 2014, Sanz-Torrent et al. 2010). As students with DLD reach the later years of their elementary education, decoding problems will either disappear or become much less severe. The transparent orthography of Spanish might affect this process and lead children with DLD to approach word-reading tasks and overcome decoding challenges more efficiently.

Cross-sectional studies with monolingual Spanish-speaking children with DLD report similar results. Children in first grade perform poorly both in decoding and reading comprehension (De Barbieri Ortiz et al. 2016, Coloma et al. 2020). However, by fourth grade, their decoding problems have receded, but their comprehension remains hindered (Lafont 2018). Moreover, Acosta et al. (2016) maintain that the presence of reading impairment in Spanish-speaking children with DLD occurs regardless of the particular type of deficit (expressive-only or both expressive and receptive). In sum, findings revealed that while reading comprehension problems persist over time, decoding problems are transient. As students with DLD reach the later years of their primary education, decoding problems are likely to either disappear or become much less severe. Spanish’s transparent orthography might help them approach decoding tasks efficiently. De Barbieri Ortiz et al. (2016) investigated the performance of Spanish-speaking first graders with DLD on linguistic and reading skills and found that the group of Spanish-speaking schoolchildren with DLD performed significantly poorer than their controls in linguistic (phonological awareness, lexicon, and narrative discourse) and reading skills (decoding and reading comprehension) (De Barbieri Ortiz et al. 2016).

Findings from Italian, also a transparent language (Brizzolara et al. 2011), report that at the end of first grade, typically developing children are reasonably accurate in decoding words in which phonemes consistently map into the same letter. However, the authors found that Italian children with DLD were delayed in learning to read and write in first grade. Nevertheless, when evaluated in second grade, most children with DLD showed a substantial improvement in approaching their peers’ reading speed and accuracy. The authors also evaluated long-term reading and spelling outcomes in Italian participants with a documented history of developmental language impairment in the preschool years. The main result was that literacy skills were generally weak among adolescents with a previous history of language impairment. As a group, these subjects performed poorer than controls on almost all measures of written language: reading decoding accuracy and speed, text comprehension, and spelling. A single-case analysis indicated a high incidence of difficulties in learning to read and write in subjects with DLD: impairments in reading decoding and spelling occurred in about three-fourths of these adolescents. At the same time, poor reading comprehension was evident in about two-thirds of them. Low academic attainments in most DLD subjects, as documented by the grade obtained on the final exam of junior high school, are in agreement with poor performance at formal reading and spelling assessments of these subjects. These results represent evidence of reading and spelling difficulties in Italian adolescents with a history of DLD and confirm that the poor literacy and academic outcomes found in other longitudinal studies with English-speaking adolescents with DLD might present the same pattern in more transparent languages, point to the need of investigating DLD reading profile throughout their schooling process.

Studies involving other languages must be more extensive in number and scope to allow conclusions and support evidence-based practice for their populations. Writing systems vary in how they represent the languages encoded in phonological, syntactic, and morphological structures, so particular effects across writing systems and orthographies are expected (Verhoeven & Landerl 2022). Thus, we reinforce the importance of understanding the decoding acquisition of DLD children on a broader set of languages, ensuring that models of DLD are accurate across languages.

To the best of our knowledge, one study assesses the reading skills of Portuguese-Speaking children with DLD, comparing these children to those with dyslexia (Oliveira et al. 2021). This highlights the scarceness of studies with Portuguese-speaking children with DLD, a language spoken by more than 200 million people. In that study, the authors investigated the phonological and reading skills of these two groups of children who speak European Portuguese and found more severe and prevalent language impairments in children with DLD than those with dyslexia, despite similar phonological and literacy difficulties. In addition, children with dyslexia and DLD scored at least 1.5 standard deviations below the mean scores of age-matched children with typical development on word and nonword reading tasks.

# 1.4 Brazilian Portuguese orthography

Portuguese is spoken by approximately 234 million people and is the ninth most spoken language in the world—close in the number of speakers with French, Arabic, Bengali, and Russian, respectively fifth to eighth places in the rank—and studies in Portuguese are incredibly scarce. It is essential to highlight that although Seymour et al. (2003) indicate that Portuguese is more complex than other transparent orthographies, their investigation concerns only the Portuguese spoken in Europe, which is very different from Brazilian Portuguese due to the linguistic variation of the latter, which was influenced by the pronunciation of different African and Indigenous dialects, due to slavery and different immigration flows during the beginning of the twentieth century. According to a Brazilian linguist (Scliar-Cabral 2003), the orthography of Brazilian Portuguese presents a set of consistent, univocal graph-phonemic relations. Additionally, the Brazilian pronunciation of vowels is different from European Portuguese, and as they are longer and more stressed, it facilitates vowel and consonant perception, phoneme-grapheme association, and, thus, their decoding (Scliar-Cabral 2003; Soares et al. 2023). Rules govern the set of inconsistent graph-phonemic relations of Brazilian Portuguese; that is, they depend on the graphemic context but are easily understandable by Brazilian Portuguese native speakers (Scliar-Cabral 2003). Only a tiny part of this set of inconsistent relationships is not rulegoverned; they are irregularly inconsistent. The three most opaque graphemes of Brazilian Portuguese are found in this last set of inconsistent relations, as will be detailed in the next paragraphs.

Brazilian Portuguese has a transparent decoding system (Pinheiro 1995, Scliar-Cabral 2003) as it has only three inconsistent (irregular) graphemes. The orthography of Brazilian Portuguese presents a set of consistent, univocal grapheme-phoneme relations and a set of inconsistent graph-phonemic relations (Scliar-Cabral 2003). Rules govern part of this set of inconsistent relationships; they are inconsistent depending on the graphemic context but easily understandable by a Brazilian-Portuguese monolingual speaker. Thus, graphemes governed by rules independent of the graphemic context are: “p,” “b,” “t,” “d,” “f,” “v,” “us,” “ç,” “sc,” “ch,” “j,” “NH,” “our,” “ü,” “ó,” “õ,” “á,” “à,” “â,” “ã.” Graphemes governed by context-dependent rules are described through 23 rules. Only a tiny part of this set of inconsistent relationships is not rule-governed; they are irregularly inconsistent. The three most opaque graphemes are found in this last set of inconsistent relations. For example, in this context, the rules for decoding the grapheme $\stackrel { \alpha } { \mathbf { g } } ^ { \mathfrak { n } }$ in front of the letters that represent vowels, that is, “i,” “í,” “e,” $\vec { \boldsymbol { \mathrm { e } } } ^ { \flat }$ and “é,” as in gelo and giraffe (ice and giraffe) and also in other contexts, as in água water, goal color, and gato cat. In alphabetic-based languages, such as Brazilian Portuguese, the development of reading begins with basic skills of grapheme-phoneme relation, followed by the acquisition of orthographic representations for more automatic and fluent decoding (Katz & Frost 1992, Defior et al. 2002, Lallier et al. 2014).

Transparency, mainly in the grapheme-to-phoneme sense, in theory, facilitates the acquisition process of written language by children with TLD and could be a facilitator for children with DLD, but findings have been inconclusive so far. In the present study, in addition to investigating the decoding abilities of elementary school-aged children in a novel transparent orthography, we included stimulus length and type (word or nonword) variables that would allow a step further on the path of investigation of decoding in transparent languages. Comprehending the decoding skills of children with DLD in different languages can holistically enrich the knowledge of DLD and how such processes vary according to the orthographic characteristics of each language.

# 1.5 Statement of the purpose, questions, and hypotheses

This study investigates the decoding abilities of children with DLD from six to ten years of age who are monolingual speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, a language with a transparent orthography that implicates a faster acquisition of decoding abilities in children with typical development (Katz & Frost 1992) compared to more opaque orthographies such as English and French, with typically developing Brazilian children having generally mastered decoding by the 3rd grade of elementary school (Scliar-Cabral 2003, Soares et al. 2017).

According to the dual route theory, two routes, phonological and lexical, are responsible for reading acquisition and development (Seidenberg 1993, Pritchard et al. 2018, Liebig et al. 2017, Wise Younger et al. 2017). The phonological route uses the grapheme-phoneme conversion process, translating letters or groups of letters into phonemes by applying grapheme-phonemic rules. The lexical route is used only when the item to be read has its orthographic representation pre-stored in the orthographic lexicon and pronunciation is not constructed segment by segment but retrieved from the orthographic lexicon. The present study is anchored in the dual route theory and considers the theoretical assumptions of the role of orthographic features on decoding, and reading acquisition.

This study aims to provide data for future cross-linguistic studies in different fields and support the construction process for evidence-based clinical practice for children with DLD who are exposed to a wider range of transparent languages. The study focuses on the following questions:

(i) Do the challenges reported in decoding for children with DLD in opaque languages hold for children with DLD who are speakers of Brazilian Portuguese? In order to answer this question, we will compare the decoding accuracy and speed of children with DLD who are speakers of Brazilian Portuguese to the performance of a matched group of children with TLD.

Hypothesis 1 (HQ1): Based on the findings for other languages, we hypothesize that the challenge of children with DLD children observed for opaque languages will hold to Brazilian Portuguese. This challenge will be reflected in a lower percentage of accuracy and in longer reading time presented by children with DLD compared to their TLD peers since their crucial phonological deficits might affect decoding acquisition. We also expect, however that older children will perform better than younger children, supporting the findings of previous studies.

(ii) Does the length and type of stimuli influence the decoding skills of children with DLD differently than when compared to children with TLD? We will compare decoding accuracy and time spent to correctly read and decode across different stimuli types and lengths to answer this question.

Hypothesis 2 (HQ2): Based on the dual route framework, we expect to find stimulus and length effects, as well as an interaction between stimulus type and length for both groups. However, given the reported phonological deficits of children with DLD, we also expect a significant group effect and interactions, with children with DLD facing more challenges with decoding nonwords.

# 2. Materials and Methods

The Institution’s Ethics and Research Committee approved this prospective cross-sectional study under number 2262-300. All children and parents or guardians signed an Informed Consent Form before participating.

# 2.1 Participants

Sixteen children with DLD between seven and ten years of age who are monolingual speakers of Brazilian Portuguese and 64 controls with typical language development (TLD) participated in the study. Children had no hearing, vision or neurologic disorder based on official and updated school file. The group of children with DLD was composed of 13 boys and three girls, with an average age of 7.2 years, and all were diagnosed with DLD by speech-language pathologists based on recent international criteria (Snowling et al. 2016, Bishop et al. 2017) as follows:

● Nonverbal intelligence within normal limits was ascertained through the application of Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices (Raven & Court 1986);   
● Deficits in short-term phonological memory assessed by a Brazilian standardized test of nonword repetition tasks (Rodrigues & Befi-Lopes 2013);   
● Deficits in several language subsystems, such as expressive vocabulary, phonology, syntax, and pragmatics assessed through a Brazilian standardized test containing all those variables (Andrade et al. 2004) in which all DLD children scored below average.

Additionally, all DLD participants underwent a dyslexia screening considering the possibility of cooccurrence of both diagnoses that could compromise the results found in the present study. Thus, we also evaluated the following:

● Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) has been described as an essential tool for differentiating DLD and dyslexia and identifying the co-diagnosis of both conditions (Snowling et al. 2019). None of the children in this sample presented disorders in RAN, pointing to a single diagnosis of DLD.   
● Prova de Consciência Sintática (Capovilla & Capovilla 2006) is a Brazilian Standardized Test in which all presented results below expected for their age and schooling, confirming that the sample presented DLD-only since one of the main characteristics includes syntactic deficits in oral language. This type of deficit is not expected to be found in children with Dyslexia (DSM-V) (American Psychiatric Association 2013).

The group of children with TLD had 64 children matched by gender, age, and socioeconomic status, with the children with DLD in a 4:1 ratio; each child in the DLD group was paired with four children in the TLD group. The matching resulted in 52 boys and 12 girls with an average age of 7.3 years, composing the group of children with TLD. All children with TLD had typical oral language, reading, and writing development, confirmed by speech therapy procedures performed for a previous study (Soares et al. 2023). To be included in the study, children with TLD should have no auditory or visual complaints; no signs of neurological or cognitive disorders; no grade retention reported in school records; no phonological and oral language alterations (Andrade et al. 2004); and scores within normal limits on the word reading subtest of the Brazilian School Performance Test (Stein et al. 2019). Summary statistics for the aforementioned tests for the group of children with DLD and TLD can be found in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. The large observed range and SD particularly for RAN times and for the word reading subtest reflect the heterogeneity of DLD and the relation between RAN and word reading, as established by the literature.

The stimuli were based on the Protocol for Decoding Acquisition Development – Protocolo de Acompanhamento do Desenvolvimento da Decodificação (PRADE) (Soares et al. 2023). It is essential to highlight that PRADE followed the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (SEPT) to assure its relevance and psychometrics properties; further information can be found in Soares et al. (2023). PRADE consists of a linguistically balanced list of words and nonwords designed according to Brazilian Portuguese decoding rules, word length variation from one to five syllables, and the frequency of co-occurrence of these words in the children’s experiences in the elementary school. It includes a total of 68 words distributed as follows:

● 16 polysyllables with four syllables $( 2 3 . 5 \% )$ (i.e., aquarela watercolor, nascimento birth)   
● Eight polysyllables with five syllables $\left( 1 1 . 7 \% \right)$ (i.e., maravilhosa wonderful, insegurança insecurity)

The complete list of words can be found in Appendix A.

PRADE (Soares et al. 2023) also includes 68 nonwords that were designed by a linguist based on the list of words, respecting the phonological structure of each one of the words and adopting the following rules:

● Vowels: (i) always keep the corresponding low for exchange ( $/ \mathrm { a } I$ in an unstressed position); (ii) replace the middle vowel with a middle vowel; and (iii) replace the high vowel with a high vowel;   
● Plosives/Fricatives: replace respecting the following order of priority: point of articulation, voicing, and, in case of impossibility, mode of articulation;   
● Nasal: replace only the point of articulation;   
● Liquid: replace lateral phonemes with nonlateral ones and vice versa.

In addition, transforming words into nonwords followed criteria for maintaining the length of the word. Thus, for the monosyllables, only the vowels were changed; for stimuli with two syllables, a vowel and a consonant were changed; for stimuli with three syllables, two consonants and one vowel were changed; for polysyllables with four or five syllables, three consonants and two vowels were changed. After changes were made to the phonological structure of the words, they were spelled respecting the decoding rules of Brazilian Portuguese. It is essential to highlight that due to such criteria to create the nonwords, they turned to be visually, orthographically and phonologically distant from the actual words which poses more challenge for readers since they have to rely only on phonological skills (i.e., letter-to-sound correspondence), which might be even more challenging for children with DLD. The list of nonwords from PRADE (Soares et al. 2023) can be found in Appendix B.

# 2.2 Procedure

In this study, all participants performed a computerized version of PRADE (Soares et al. 2022) designed on E-Prime 3.0 software (Psychology Software, Pittsburgh, PA), where they were asked to decode words and nonwords that appeared on the computer screen. Data collection was carried out face-to-face. Before starting the experiment, each child was presented with a screen containing instructions about the test, which the researcher read in Brazilian Portuguese. The English translation of the instruction follows: “Hello! Next, words that exist and that do not exist of different sizes will appear. Read them aloud the way you think the word should be read. Press a button when you are done. If a word you do not know appears, no problem, press a button to move on to the next one! Good reading.” The stimuli to be decoded were typed in Arial font, size 20, uppercase. Younger Brazilian children are only exposed to uppercase letters, therefore, due to the age range of participants, uppercase letters were used to avoid age bias. The children were instructed to read the words how they were used to or how they thought they should be read. If the child refused to read the word or could not decode it, they could skip it. The stimuli were programmed to appear on the screen in random order.

The session was video recorded for posterior analysis. Two speech-language pathologists conducted transcriptions of the responses, and data analysis included the decoding time of correctly read words and nonwords. Decoding time was calculated by E-Prime (Psychology Software, Pittsburgh, PA). It consisted of the interval between the onset of stimuli on the screen and the button’s press after decoding the word. Accuracy analysis for all stimulus types and lengths consisted of assigning a score of 0 to incorrect decoding and 1 to correct decoding. No discrepancies were observed between the two judges.

# 2.2.1 Statistical analysis

Decoding time was analyzed using a mixed-effects generalized linear regression model using the gamma distribution with log link, where the subject was treated as a random effect to account for within-subject correlation. The gamma distribution was chosen due to its ability to model right-skewed data $\mathrm { \Delta N g ~ \& ~ }$ Cribbie 2017). The model included terms for the group (DLD, TLD), stimuli type (word, nonword), and stimuli length (1-5 syllables), as well as all 2-way interactions and the 3-way interaction between these predictor variables. Stimuli type and stimuli length are within-subject factors; the group is a between-subject factor. The percent decoding accuracy was analyzed similarly using a mixed effects logistic regression model for binomial data. Statistical tests were conducted using Wald Chi-squared $( \mathrm { X } ^ { 2 } )$ statistics. P-values $< 0 . 0 5$ were considered statistically significant. Analyses were performed using the lme4 package (Bates et al. 2015) within the R version 4.1.3 computing environment (R Core Team 2022).

# 3. Results

# 3.1 Decoding accuracy

Results from the mixed effects logistic regression model applied to the percent accuracy data are summarized in Table 3. Predicted means from the model are graphed in Figure 1. Table 3 and Figure 1 show that accuracy decreases as stimuli length increases for both groups and both stimuli types.

The logistic regression model indicated no significant effect for group $( \mathrm { X } ^ { 2 } = 1 . 7 3$ , $\operatorname { d f } = 1$ , $\mathrm { p } = 0 . 1 8 8 \mathrm { ^ { \circ } }$ , and significant effects for type of stimuli $\mathrm { ( X } ^ { 2 } = 3 3 . 7 0$ , $\operatorname { d f } = 1$ , $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 , } \end{array}$ ) and length of stimuli $( \mathrm { X } ^ { 2 } =$ 77.78, $\mathrm { d f } = 4$ , $\begin{array} { r }  \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 \ \end{array}$ ). Significant interactions were observed between type and length of stimuli $\textstyle ( \mathrm { X } ^ { 2 }$ $= 4 1 . 7 5$ , $\mathrm { d f } = 4$ , $\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 )$ ; group and length of stimuli $\mathrm { ~ \textit ~ { ~ X ~ } ~ } ^ { 2 } = 5 8 . 2 5$ , $\mathrm { d f } = 4$ , $\begin{array} { r }  \mathbf { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 \ \end{array}$ ); and group, type, and length of stimuli $\mathrm { ~ X } ^ { 2 } = 2 9 . 2 4$ , $\mathrm { d f } = 4$ , $\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 $ ).

Children with DLD showed significantly lower decoding accuracy than children with TLD in longer words and nonwords with five syllables. No significant between-group differences were observed for short stimuli.

Chi-squared tests revealed significant effects of stimuli length on accuracy for both word and nonword type of stimuli for both groups (all $\mathrm { p } < 0 . 0 0 1 $ ). Within-group tests of accuracy between words and nonwords revealed that children with TLD had significantly different performance between the two types of stimuli for all lengths but two-syllable. However, children with DLD had better performance in words only for short stimuli (see Table 4).

# 3.2 Decoding time

Results from the mixed effects gamma regression model applied to the decoding time data are summarized in Table 4. Predicted geometric means from the model are graphed in Figure 2. As Table 4 and Figure 2 show, children with DLD presented longer decoding time than children with TLD, regardless of stimuli type (word and nonword) and extension (number of syllables), with less pronounced differences for one-syllable words and one-syllable nonwords.

# 4. Discussion

The present study investigated the decoding skills of children with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) who are monolingual speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, a language with transparent grapheme to phoneme orthography (Scliar-Cabral 2003). Data indicated that Brazilian children with DLD in general tend to show poorer decoding skills than their peers with typical language development (TLD). Additionally, we noted that children with DLD needed more time than children with TLD to correctly read words and nonwords. These findings confirm our first hypothesis that stated that based on the findings for other languages, the challenge of children with DLD children observed for opaque languages would also hold to Brazilian Portuguese.

In general, children with DLD tend to perform better when reading and writing real words, since they might rely more strongly on visual patterns than orthographic patterns (Snowling & Hulme 2021). Current findings align with those which investigated decoding skills in DLD children in other transparent languages in this regard (Brizzolara et al. 2011, De Barbieri Ortiz et al. 2016, Coloma et al. 2020), support our second hypothesis that stated that based on the dual route framework, stimulustype and length effects were expected, and given the reported phonological deficits of children with DLD, children with DLD were expected to face more challenges with decoding nonwords. One of the novelties of the current study was the addition of stimuli length as a variable. Also supporting our second hypothesis, children with DLD in the current study faced additional challenges with longer stimuli, which could possibly be related to their poor phonological memory skills (Gathercole & Bradley 1993). Additional studies are needed to directly investigate the effect of phonological memory on this task. The different effects of type and length of stimuli on the decoding accuracy and on decoding time of the two groups highlights the multifaceted nature of decoding. The following sessions will discuss the effects of type and length of stimuli, respectively, on decoding.

# 4.1 Effect of type of stimuli on decoding

Phonological and lexical routes are responsible for the acquisition and development of reading from decoding skills to reading fluency, which leads to reading comprehension later on (Malins et al. 2017, Grainger et al. 2016). Proficient reading is only reached when decoding is automatized and when cognitive and metacognitive mechanisms are available to enable the understanding of the decoded material (Pritchard et al. 2018, Liebig et al. 2017, Wise Younger et al. 2017, Malins et al. 2017, Grainger et al. 2016). However, it is essential to emphasize that the simultaneous use of both reading routes occurs even for the proficient reader. The lexical route is more related to speed, while the phonological route is related to accuracy. Therefore, even in competent readers, the reading of nonwords, more related to phonological skills and the phonological route, tends to be slower, as observed in the group of children with TLD from this study. The type of stimuli affected decoding accuracy for children with DLD and TLD who speak Brazilian Portuguese, corroborating the dual route theory detailed above. That said, the relationship between the type of stimuli and decoding was more complex, as significant interactions were found between the length and type of stimuli. The interactions varied according to the two different groups.

Children with TLD studied here had significantly poorer accuracy performance in nonwords than words for all lengths but for two-syllable. This indicates that children with typical development who speak Brazilian Portuguese tend to have more difficulty decoding nonwords since they depend on the phonological component of language, which is expected according to the dual route theory.

Children with DLD, however, had poorer performance in nonwords than words only for short stimuli. This effect might be explained by the high-frequency of the shorter words, leading DLD children to use the lexical route, which is described to be their principal route to read since the phonological component of language is strongly compromised (Malins et al. 2017; Grainger et al. 2016; Snowling et al. 2016, 2021). Findings from other languages also support that children with DLD tend to rely more on orthographic representations (lexical route) than on graphophonemic conversion (phonological route) (Coloma et al. 2020; Snowling et al. 2016, 2021; Kouri 2020) and the current data from Brazilian Portuguese reinforce this hypothesis.

Even though the phoneme-grapheme association in Brazilian Portuguese facilitates decoding better than what is observed for European Portuguese, current results align with those observed for children with DLD who are European-Portuguese speakers (Oliveira et al. 2021), showing that acquiring decoding skills is challenging for this population. However, although Portuguese and Spanish are considered to have transparent orthographies, findings for these two languages differ. European-Portuguese-speaking children with DLD presented difficulties in all literacy skills, including text reading speed and accuracy and Brazilian-Portuguese-speaking children faced challenges with decoding all stimuli, regardless of length or type, which did not occur for Spanishspeaking children with DLD (Coloma et al. 2020). European Portuguese is more complex than other transparent orthographies, as Seymour et al. (2003) stated, while Spanish has fewer inconsistencies than European and Brazilian Portuguese, which might explain the difference in findings. Gradience of transparency might play a role, which highlights the importance of more studies involving decoding skills and reading acquisition of DLD children who are speakers of languages other than English.

Previous studies revealed that decoding time is longer for nonwords than for words for children with DLD who speak different languages (Coloma et al. 2020; Snowling et al. 2016, 2021; Kouri 2020). We observed a similar pattern for Brazilian Portuguese when comparing the decoding time of words and nonwords, with the addition that the length of words for Brazilian children with DLD seem to be challenging as Soares et al. (2023) have previously suggested for Brazilian children with TLD. Additionally, the way the nonwords of the current study were constructed - as phonologically and orthographically distant nonwords - might have created more demands on the phonological route. Furthermore, the fact that words and nonwords were presented in a mixed list could have induced a strategic use of the phonological route and decreased the use of the lexical route. After all, the former could be used to read both types of stimuli. Thus, knowing the strong phonological impairments present by DLD children, this might have led to their lower results for both stimuli (Snowling & Hulme 2021, Befi-Lopes et al. 2022). Findings from orthographically opaque languages such as English and French report that children with DLD are less successful for phonologically distant nonwords, suggesting that children with DLD do not simply present a homogeneous delay in their ability to recognize written words but rather a deviant development with more substantial reliance on the orthographic reading route compared to the phonological one (Kouri 2020, Macchi et al. 2019). This pattern also holds for Brazilian Portuguese, even though the language is considered highly transparent in the grapheme-to-phoneme way (Scliar-Cabral 2004, Soares et al. 2023), which suggests that the phonological deficits of children with DLD affects their ability to learn how to read in any language, possibly at different degrees, regardless of its opacity levels.

# 4.2 Effect of length of stimuli on decoding

The results of the current study revealed significant interaction between group and length stimuli as well as group, type, and length of stimuli interaction, indicating that children with DLD and children with TLD performed differently depending on length and type of stimuli. Children with DLD performed poorer than their peers with TLD on longer stimuli, but their performance showed some variation for words and nonwords. It is noteworthy to mention that none of the previous studies in transparent languages which investigated decoding acquisition in DLD children have reported detailed analysis for the length of stimuli, which enriches the discussion regarding decoding and reading acquisition and brings essential theoretical and clinical implications.

In the current study, although children with DLD needed more time to decode words and nonwords and presented lower levels of accuracy, children with DLD performed similarly to children with TLD in short words and only had difficulty decoding words with four and five syllables. Other factors involved in stimuli length, such as phonological working memory, might affect decoding for children with DLD to a larger extent. Nonetheless, it is clear that other factors, such as stimulus length and possibly word frequency, played a role in the decoding abilities presented by Brazilian-Portuguese speakers with DLD. Although the current study did not directly investigate word frequency as a variable, only high frequency words for elementary school were included on PRADE (Soares et al. 2023). Furthermore, the extension of deficits of children with DLD on various subsystems of language and also on phonological processing as whole (Broc et al. 2021, Snowling & Hulme 2021, Befi-Lopes et al. 2022) might affect their performance. This needs to be explored in future studies in transparent languages.

Previous studies with children with DLD revealed that decoding time increases according to the increase in the length of the stimuli (Coloma et al. 2020; Snowling et al. 2016, 2021; Kouri 2020). The results of the present study align with the aforementioned, even though the number of stimuli was reduced for longer words and nonwords as decoding time was calculated only for correct responses. Decoding time was assessed as the interval between stimulus onset and the end of the participant’s vocal response, and not by reaction times. Although the measure employed confounds reaction time with word length, it is a measure that considers the time to correctly decode a full stimulus, and the between-group differences observed here justify the validity of this measure. The fact that children with DLD presented longer decoding time than children with TLD, regardless of stimuli type (word and nonword) and length, examined in conjunction with accuracy findings, reveals that even though children with DLD had similar accuracy performance in short stimuli than children with TLD, they still needed more time to process and accurately to decode the stimuli.

Previous studies on a variety of languages have reported that age is an essential factor in the decoding abilities of children with DLD and that only in later grades they tend to present decoding patterns similar to their typically developing peers in some languages (Kouri 2020; Lafont 2018; Coloma et al. 2016, 2015b; De Barbieri et al., 2016; Macchi et al. 2019). Spanish-Speaking children with DLD in first grade perform low both in decoding and reading comprehension (Coloma et al. 2015c, 2015b; De Barbieri et al., 2016), and by fourth grade, their decoding problems have receded with intervention (Lafont 2018). However, data from European-Portuguese speakers indicate a different pattern, reporting that children with DLD decoding skills are also observed in later school grades (Oliveira et al. 2021). Although our sample comprises children from seven to 10 years of age (corresponding from first to fifth grade), children with DLD of all ages performed poorer than children with TLD, suggesting that, for Brazilian Portuguese, decoding skills of children with DLD have not been mastered by fifth grade.

# 5. Conclusion

Data from the present study provide evidence that children with DLD who are speakers of Brazilian Portuguese, a transparent language, have deficits in the acquisition of decoding reflected in both accuracy and reading time compared to matched controls with TLD. The present study provides substantial evidence that the decoding profile of children with DLD is subject to multiple influences, not only with relation to the length and type of stimuli, that is, words and nonwords, but also characteristics of the languages these children are being literate in, highlighting the multifactorial nature involved in the development of decoding. This is of fundamental importance to theoretical applications and clinical and educational actions for this population.

# 5.1 Limitations and future directions

The study was conducted with varying number of words for each syllable count and readers should keep this fact in mind as they interpret results. Furthermore, since the design employed matched the participants only on age/grade, a discussion of delayed versus abnormal development is not appropriate. Future studies should aim at comparing delayed and abnormal development with a design with two control groups: one age-matched and the other one matched on reading skills. Future studies to look more deeply into the decoding processing of children with DLD by including online processing data measures, as overt accuracy measures do not reveal the whole picture. In addition, a longitudinal analysis would allow us to investigate the effect of age on decoding. Such analysis will aid in verifying if the absence of challenges reported for short stimuli reflects the typical path of DLD, where phonological difficulties decrease over time. This would further expand the knowledge regarding the decoding acquisition process of children with DLD who are speakers of Brazilian Portuguese.
