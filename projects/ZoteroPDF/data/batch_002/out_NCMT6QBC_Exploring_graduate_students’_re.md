# ABSTRACT

The job demands-resources (JD-R) theory has been widely applied to explore relationships between employees’ job characteristics and performance, particularly in contexts of paid work. This study extends the application scope of the JD-R theory to unpaid research contexts among graduate students. Results of an online questionnaire survey with 914 research-oriented Chinese graduate students verified the dual processes proposed by the JD-R theory. Specifically, the graduate students’ perceived stress led to emotional exhaustion and sequentially decreased their research career commitment; academic support fostered mastery approach and then increased the research career commitment. In addition, mastery approach played a significant mediating role in the relationship between academic support and research career commitment. The findings enhance the understanding of graduate students’ research characteristics and performance and have implications for optimizing the research environment for graduate students and stimulating their motivation and commitment to research career.

# Introduction

The job demands-resources (JD-R) theory, originally proposed by Demerouti et al. (2001), has been proven as a significant framework to conceptualize the influence of job characteristics on employees’ performance and well-being (Bakker, Demerouti, and Sanz-Vergel 2023). So far, thousands of empirical studies have evidenced the flexibility of the theory in its application to considerable occupational environments mainly in contexts of paid work (e.g. Baka 2015; Menguc et al. 2013; Selander 2015). In the educational context, the JD-R theory has been primarily used in empirical studies of teachers (Han, Yin, Wang, Zhang 2020) and administrators (Boyd et al. 2011). Only recently has the theory been applied to studies involving students in senior high schools (Teuber, Nussbeck, and Wild 2021) and universities (Lesener et al. 2020). Empirical studies have proved that the same processes that occurred in the workplace were also implicated in academic processes and outcomes of students (Leslie, Brown, and Aiken 2021). With the increased number of research on study characteristics that are specific to students underpinning the JD-R theory (Lesener et al. 2020; Teuber, Nussbeck, and Wild 2021), very little is known about academic graduate students whose study involves a series of demands and resources which in turn influence their academic motivation and achievement.

Unlike undergraduate studies, the academic demands and resources faced by graduate students are mainly related to the academic ability for scientific research (Hyun et al. 2006). Graduate students are generally regarded as future independent researchers, and their development of academic ability is of great significance for graduate education (Grady et al. 2014). However, more and more graduate students find themselves in unimaginable difficulties in dealing with research stress, leading to emotional exhaustion and the lack of motivation (El-Ghoroury et al. 2012). Meanwhile, graduate students’ perceived overwhelming demands would increase the risk of health problems and the refusion of the research career commitment (Grady et al. 2014). Graduate students have been generally found to be more enthusiastic about academic research as they succeed in coping with stress, fully utilize academic resources for the academic achievements, and have harmonious relationships with peers and supervisors (Lorenzetti et al. 2019). Thus, it is of great significance to figure out how to help graduate students better regulate study demands and resources during the research process. Underpinned by the JD-R theory, this study investigated the relationships between graduate students’ perceived study demands (perceived stress), resources (academic support), and research career commitment. It also explored the mediation effects of mastery approach and emotional exhaustion on the relationships between those variables. The findings of this study will provide empirical evidence for the applicability of the JD-R theory in unpaid contexts among graduate students. Additionally, the study will offer insights into enhancing the research conditions and experiences of graduate students, thereby boosting their motivation and enthusiasm and effectively increasing their commitment to a research career.

# Literature

# The JD-R theory and its application in educational contexts

The JD-R theory is highly popular to explore relationships between employees’ job characteristics, performance, and well-being (Schaufeli and Taris 2014). The basic assumption of this theory is the distinction of two categories of job characteristics: job demands and job resources (Bakker, Demerouti, and Sanz-Vergel 2023). Job demands refer to physical, psychological, social, or organizational aspects inherent in jobs that necessitate continuous efforts from the employees, and are thus associated with physical or psychological costs (Bakker, Demerouti, and Sanz-Vergel 2023). Prevalent examples include time and work pressure (Selander 2015), emotional demands (Han, Yin, and Wang 2020), and unfavorable work conditions (Baka 2015). Job resources pertain to physical, psychological, social, or organizational factors that have the potential to motivate engagement and mitigate burdens (Bakker, Demerouti, and Sanz-Vergel 2023). These resources are beneficial in accomplishing work objectives and fostering personal growth (Demerouti et al. 2001). Prevalent examples are performance feedback (Menguc et al. 2013), and support from colleagues and supervisors (Ma, Yao, and Hou 2023). The distinction between job demands and resources respectively leads to two psychological processes. One process is the health impairment process which suggests that high job demands result in greater exertion, emotional exhaustion, and health problems (Schaufeli and Taris 2014). The other is the motivational process which suggests that job resources fulfill the fundamental requirements and stimulate engagement and better performance of employees (Schaufeli and Taris 2014).

The flexibility and broad application scope of the JD-R theory have initiated studies among students, whose core activities, i.e. academic studies, are generally considered a kind of work (Lesener et al. 2020). Like employees, students are always involved in organized and time-limited activities that require efforts (Nielsen et al. 2017). Therefore, in most cases, the similarities between work and study make it possible to transfer the JD-R theory from paid work contexts to unpaid educational contexts (Körner, Rigotti, and Rieder 2021). Recently, the JD-R theory has been applied to investigate demands and resources faced by high school students and undergraduate students, such as academic workload (Cilliers, Mostert, and Nel 2018) and professor feedback (Wang et al. 2023), leaving that of graduate students unexploited. As every phase of the study involves a series of demands and resources, graduate students also struggle with academic characteristics that have been proven to influence motivation and achievement (Leslie, Brown, and Aiken 2021; Yoo and Marshall 2022). Therefore, the studies of graduate students based on the JD-R theory need to be conducted.

# Graduate students’ perceived stress of academic research as demands

Stress is the physical or emotional reaction caused by an individual’s response to environmental pressures and conflicts (Lazarus and Folkman 1987). It is widely known as one of the increasing problems threatening the psychological and physical well-being in the daily lives of individuals (Cohen, Kamarck, and Mermelstein 1983). According to the JD-R theory, individuals tend to feel the situation stressful when they fail to cope with the job demands (Schaufeli and Taris 2014). Therefore, stress is commonly regarded as an indicator of demands (Hoefsmit and Cleef 2018).

Graduate students have already been found to experience a transitional status with limited academic access and ability because of their ambiguous position and identity (Grady et al. 2014). Evidence from previous studies indicates that graduate students are confronted with academic stress from both internal and external factors. Typical internal factors include insufficient academic capacity (Brown, Anderson-Johnson, and Mcpherson 2016) and fear of difficulty (Leslie, Brown, and Aiken 2021). The external factors include expectations from supervisors (Grady et al. 2014), time constraints, and work overload (Allen et al. 2021).

In most cases, the overwhelming stress reported by graduate students causes physical and mental problems such as exhaustion, headaches, and poor academic performance (Brown, Anderson-Johnson, and Mcpherson 2016; Hyun et al. 2006). As a result, graduate students tend to show less motivation and commitment after experiencing excess academic stress (Amida, Algarni, and Stupnisky 2021). Thus, this study regards the perceived stress of graduate students as the indicator of job demands.

# Graduate students’ academic support of research as resources

Academic support is widely accepted as a crucial factor for graduate students, and it generally refers to the perceived emotional and instrumental assistance to deal with the demands and to promote engagement (Wang et al. 2023). According to Zeng, Webster, and Ginns (2013), the academic support that is frequently commented on by graduate students during the research experience typically includes supervision, infrastructure, and intellectual climate. Supervision refers to the degree to which the graduate students are satisfied with the support and guidance from supervisors, including academic instruction and feedback. The infrastructure concerns the accessibility of university technology and resources for academic research, such as the suitable research space and the necessary equipment. The intellectual climate that measures an encouraging and supportive research environment, is characterized by the opportunities of professional skills and growth for graduate students. In addition, peer support, the encouragement, assistance, and supportive information from peer groups (Martinsuo and Turkulainen 2011), is widely known as vital academic support due to the significance of interpersonal relationships (Gu, Zhang, and Liu 2014; Körner, Rigotti, and Rieder 2021).

Considerable empirical studies have demonstrated that graduate students are more active in adjusting themselves to the environment (Chang, Wu, and Ye 2022), pursue high-level engagement (Yun and Park 2020), and obtain academic success with academic support (Lorenzetti et al. 2019). Otherwise, graduate students tend to experience emotional exhaustion (Brown, AndersonJohnson, and Mcpherson 2016). This study regards the academic support of graduate students as the indicator of resources.

# Emotional exhaustion, original mastery approach, and research career commitment

According to the dual processes of the JD-R theory, burnout, motivation, and performance are significant consequences of job resources and demands (Bakker, Demerouti, and Sanz-Vergel 2023). Emotional exhaustion, the critical element of burnout, refers to the extent of the feeling of tiredness due to work overload and the depletion of emotional resources (Bresó, Salanova, and Schaufeli 2007). Graduate students suffering from emotional exhaustion were found to have a cynical attitude and the feeling of being incompetent and exhausted (Allen et al. 2021). Motivation has been described as the adaptive cognition and behavior that is stimulated by mastery approach (Singh et al. 2022), the striving to increase task-referential and self-referential competence to obtain more active outcomes (Korn, Elliot, and Daumiller 2019). The mastery approach of graduate students generally encourages them to develop research skills and competence (Korn, Elliot, and Daumiller 2019). Commitment is the significant indicator of the performance in the JD-R theory (Schaufeli and Taris 2014). Research career commitment of graduate students, an important commitment within higher education (Cownie 2019), indicates how much students value pursuing a research career from now to the future (Paglis, Green, and Bauer 2006). It provides perseverance in improving efficacy and is commonly regarded as the crucial determinant of academic success (Cownie 2019).

It should be noted that numerous studies underpinned by the JD-R theory have already proved the mediating roles of engagement and burnout in the relationships between the demands/ resources and performance (Han, Yin, Wang, Zhang 2020; Baka 2015). Meanwhile, both graduate students’ perceived stress and academic support were directly related to the emotional exhaustion and mastery approach (Deemer et al. 2009; Körner, Rigotti, and Rieder 2021; Ma, Yao, and Hou 2023). And the research career commitment was found to decrease due to emotional exhaustion and increased with improved mastery approach (Chang, Wu, and Ye 2022). As a preliminary study of the application of the JD-R theory among graduate students, the emotional exhaustion and the mastery approach were hypothesized to mediate the relationships between perceived stress/ academic support and research career commitment in this present study.

In short, based on the JD-R theory, this study aims to explore relationships between graduate students’ perceived stress and academic support and their research career commitment from the dual operation processes of the theory and the mediation effects of emotional exhaustion and mastery approach. Based on the literature review, we proposed the hypothesized research model which is shown in Figure 1. The hypotheses are as follows:

Hypothesis 1. Perceived stress is positively related to emotional exhaustion (H1a) and negatively related to mastery approach (H1b).

Hypothesis 2. Academic support is negatively related to emotional exhaustion (H2a) and positively related to mastery approach (H2b).

Hypothesis 3. Research career commitment is negatively related to emotional exhaustion (H3a) and positively related to mastery approach (H3b).

Hypothesis 4. Emotional exhaustion mediates the effect of perceived stress (H4a) and academic support (H4b) on research career commitment.

Hypothesis 5. Mastery approach mediates the effect of perceived stress (H5a) and academic support (H5b) on research career commitment.

# Method

# Participants

The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Human Participants Ethics Committee of Shandong University. An anonymous online questionnaire survey was conducted through an online platform Wenjuanxing in December 2022, adhering to the principle of voluntary participation. The convenience sampling approach was adopted through online media and social networks. After deleting invalid responses with incomplete or identical answers, our sample was based on 914 valid responses extracted from 1086, with an $8 4 \%$ valid response rate.

It should be noted that in China, academic degrees are often research-oriented and academic graduate students are often required a thesis or capstone project to graduate, whereas professional degrees focus on the practical application and require students to accomplish internships before graduation, without many academic assignments. Considering these differences and the relevance of the research theme, only students studying for academic degrees were involved in this study. Specifically, our sample consisted of 815 $( 8 9 . 2 \% )$ academic master’s students and 99 $( 1 0 . 8 \% )$ academic doctoral students from 87 universities mainly distributed in East China (455, $4 9 . 8 \%$ ) and Southwest China (236, $2 5 . 8 \% )$ . Of the sample, 643 $( 7 0 . 4 \% )$ students were from 29 key research-oriented universities and 217 $( 2 3 . 7 \% )$ from 56 teaching-oriented universities. Their average age was 24 ranging from 21 to 45. This sample is considered representative considering the distribution of university types, academic experience, and disciplines. Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of participants.

# Measures

# Perceived stress scale

The Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen, Kamarck, and Mermelstein 1983) was adopted to assess graduate students’ perceived academic stress. As the original scale was developed to assess nonspecific stress in the etiology of disease and behavioral disorders, six items regarding personal life were excluded (e.g. ‘In the last month, how often have you dealt successfully with irritating life hassle?’). After an initial exploratory factor analysis, two items with factor loadings less than .4 were deleted. Finally, six items were retained, and all items were scored on a 5-point Likert scale ( $0 =$ never, $4 =$ very often) (see Appendix).

Note: \*Grade: seven missing data.

# Academic support scale

The Academic Support Scale was composed of four factors. Three factors (supervision, infrastructure, and intellectual climate) were extracted from the Student Research Experience Questionnaire (Zeng, Webster, and Ginns 2013), and one factor (peer support) was from the Peer Support Scale (Martinsuo and Turkulainen 2011). Each factor was displayed by five items, with those of the Student Research Experience Questionnaire being selected from the 7-item original subscales to satisfy the research background. Each item was measured by a 5-point Likert scale $1 =$ strongly disagree, $5 =$ strongly agree).

# Mastery approach scale

Mastery approach was measured by four items, of which three were from the $2 \times 2$ Standpoints and Standards Achievement Goal Questionnaire (Korn, Elliot, and Daumiller 2019) and one from the Achievement Goals Scale (Daumiller and Dresel 2020). All items were scored on a 5-point Likert scale ( $1 =$ not at all true of me, $5 =$ extremely true of me).

# Emotional exhaustion scale

Emotional exhaustion was measured by five items from the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Student Survey (Bresó, Salanova, and Schaufeli 2007) using a 7-point scale $0 =$ never, $6 =$ always).

# Research career commitment scale

Research career commitment was measured by a 5-item Career Commitment Scale (Paglis, Green, and Bauer 2006) using a 5-point Likert scale ( $\ 1 =$ strongly disagree, $5 =$ strongly agree).

# Statistical analysis

AMOS 26.0 and SPSS 26.0 were respectively used to explore the rationality of the model. First, the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted via AMOS 26.0 to examine the construct validity of scales. The descriptive statistics (M and SD), correlations, and reliability were calculated using SPSS 26.0. In addition to the Cronbach’s alpha coefficients, omega total, average variance extracted (AVE), and the square root of AVE were also computed to respectively examine the composite reliability (CR), convergent validity, and discriminant validity. Second, AMOS 26.0 was used to construct a structural equation model (SEM) to verify the relationships between variables, with the mediation effects tested by bootstrapping.

The model was acceptable based on a series of indexes. Specifically, Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) should exceed .90 (Schermelleh-Engel, Moosbrugger, and Müller 2003), and the root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) was less than .10 (Browne and Cudeck 1993). Additionally, the effect sizes were distinguished by intervals proposed by Gignac and Szodorai (2016): small $= . 1 0 \ – . 2 0$ , medium $= . 2 0 – . 3 0 _ { i }$ and large $= \ge$ .30.

# Results

# Validity and reliability

CFA results of the five measurement models, shown in Table 2, demonstrated that the model fit indexes were acceptable. The reliability of Cronbach’s α coefficients which ranged from .88 to .93 was also suitable (see Table 3). The Appendix revealed that the composite reliability coefficient of all factors (ranging from .76 to .93) the average variance extracted (AVE) (ranging from .51 to .73), and all factor loadings were at good levels. It should be noted that item 2 was deleted from the Research Career Commitment Scale because the estimate of squared multiple correlations (.42) did not significantly exceed .5 (Wipulanusat, Panuwatwanich, and Stewar 2017). The square root of the AVE of each construct exceeded the estimates of intercorrelation between them, thus the discriminant validity among the variables was good (Hair et al. 2021).

# Descriptive statistics and correlations

Descriptive statistics and the correlation matrix of all factors are shown in Table 3. Of the four factors of academic support, supervision $( M = 4 . 0 1$ , $S D = . 7 0$ ) has the highest mean score, and the intellectual climate $\langle M = 3 . 7 8$ , $S D = . 7 3$ ) has the lowest. The mean scores of other factors were all higher than the median scores of each scale to which they belong, indicating high levels of each factor. The mastery approach $( M = 4 . 4 4$ , $S D = . 5 8 )$ was far higher than the midpoint (3) of a 5-point Likert scale, while the emotional exhaustion $\left( M = 3 . 3 6 \right.$ , $S D = 1 . 1 0 )$ slightly exceeded the midpoint (3) of its scale.

Pearson’s correlations between factors can also be found in Table 3. All factors of academic support showed positive correlations with mastery approach and research career commitment, and negative correlations with perceived stress and emotional exhaustion. The perceived stress demonstrated a positive correlation with emotional exhaustion and negative correlations with mastery approach and research career commitment. Emotional exhaustion showed negative correlations with mastery approach and research career commitment, and mastery approach showed a positive correlation with research career commitment.

# Structural equation model analysis

Figure 2 demonstrates that the SEM model fits the data well $\textstyle ( \chi ^ { 2 } = 2 7 7 1 . 2 1$ , $d f = 6 8 5$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , CFI $= . 9 3$ , TLI = .92, $\mathsf { R M S E A } = . 0 5 8 )$ and it displays the relationships between all variables. The variances explained in the model were .47 (emotional exhaustion), .11 (mastery approach), and .36 (research career commitment).

The perceived stress was positively related to exhaustion with a large effect size $( \beta = . 6 5 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ , not significantly related to the mastery approach $( \beta = - . 0 3 , p \mathrm { > } . 0 5 )$ , so the H1a was accepted and the H1b was rejected. Additionally, the academic support was positively related to the mastery approach with a large effect size $( \beta = . 3 2 , p { < } . 0 0 1 )$ ), and negatively related to exhaustion with a small effect size $( \beta = \cdot . 1 0 , p < . 0 1 )$ , indicating that the H2a and H2b were both received. The positive relationship of the mastery approach on research career commitment was confirmed with a large effect size $( \beta$ $= . 3 3 .$ , $p < . 0 0 1 $ ), thus H3b was acceptable. The negative relationship of exhaustion on research career commitment was also approved with a small effect size $( \beta = \cdot . 1 1$ , $p < . 0 5 )$ ), thus H3a was supported.

# Mediation analysis

The mediation effect was tested by AMOS 26.0 using 5000 bootstrapping samples. As proposed by Hayes (2009), indirect effects can be considered statistically significant if the $9 5 \%$ confidence interval excludes zero within its lower and upper bounds. According to Table 4, only the mastery approach can be the mediator in the relationship between academic support and research career commitment, with a small effect size (.10). The mediation effect of emotional exhaustion between academic support and research career commitment was not significant due to a very small effect size (.01). Thus, hypothesis H5b was accepted and hypothesis H4b was rejected. In addition, the mediation effects of emotional exhaustion (-.07) and of mastery approach (-.01) between perceived stress and research career commitment were not significant because of the small effect size, thus hypotheses H4a and H5a were rejected.

# Discussion

This study extends the applicability of the JD-R theory to unpaid contexts by addressing the research characteristics of graduate students. As a significant contribution of the present study, our results confirmed the dual processes of the JD-R theory among graduate students, and provided further understanding of the complex interactions between research characteristics of unpaid graduate students and their research career commitment by revealing the mediation effects of the emotional exhaustion and mastery approach in the job demands-resources theory.

# The applicability of the JD-R theory in research contexts

This study verified the dual processes of the JD-R theory among graduate students. Specifically, the health impairment process revealed that graduate students’ perceived stress was positively associated with emotional exhaustion, resulting in decreased research career commitment. This indicates that graduate students would feel emotionally drained and tend to decrease their dedication to research pursuits due to research pressures. This is consistent with previous studies which revealed that graduate students’ perceived overwhelming stress from research has detrimental effects on their emotional well-being (Hyun et al. 2006; Ma, Yao, and Hou 2023). As the literature indicates, graduate students are generally in competitive environments and the challenging demands such as limited time constraints and high research requirements could make them feel exhausted (ElGhoroury et al. 2012). They tend to doubt their coping capacities, suppressing their enthusiasm and commitment to their research career due to the sense of powerlessness (Allen et al. 2021). Additionally, research is characterized by uncertainty for graduate students, leading to fears of being unable to handle challenges (Grady et al. 2014). With worries about research products and career prospects, they would be more stressed and reluctant to dedicate themselves to research career (Woolston 2022).

Meanwhile, consistent with the motivational process, our results showed that the academic support for graduate students was positively related to mastery approach, leading to increased commitment to research career. This indicates that the provision of academic support for graduate students can stimulate their positive attitudes towards and desirable behaviors in their research careers, echoing the previous findings that highlighted the crucial role of academic resources in fostering their motivation and engagement in the research process (Lorenzetti et al. 2019; Martinsuo and Turkulainen 2011). Research indicates that graduate students would have a sense of being supported and belongingness under the continuous feedback and instruction of supervisors, peers, and institutions (Gu, Zhang, and Liu 2014). Specifically, with the increased emphasis on accountability of supervisors who are responsible for graduate students’ research works and studies (Halse 2011), graduate students can set realistic goals under the guidance, enhance mastery efficiency, and improve their performance (Ma, Yao, and Hou 2023; Martinsuo and Turkulainen 2011). Meanwhile, the high-quality infrastructure and favorable intellectual climate were also found effective in optimizing graduate students’ experience, academic engagement, and better performance (e.g. Zeng, Webster, and Ginns 2013; Wang et al. 2023). A close and stable relationship with and emotional support from peer groups could help graduate students receive assistance, increase intrinsic motivation, and promote research commitment (e.g. Gu, Zhang, and Liu 2014).

The verification of the dual psychological processes of our study provides evidence for the feasibility of the application of the JD-R theory in unpaid contexts particularly among graduate students.

The fact that the JD-R theory never restricts itself to specific demands or resources indicates that any demand or resource can be regarded as the antecedent predicting performance and well-being (Schaufeli and Taris 2014). This characteristic has been proven to allow the feasibility of the JD-R theory for studies among unpaid individuals (Teuber, Nussbeck, and Wild 2021). In addition, the similarities between research activity and paid work further support the application of the JD-R theory in unpaid contexts. On one hand, graduate students, like employees, participate in organized and goaloriented activities such as seminars and workshops under the guidance of supervisors and institutions (Körner, Rigotti, and Rieder 2021). On the other hand, they need to apply certain abilities to complete tasks within a given time such as submitting a thesis successfully to obtain the diploma (Leslie, Brown, and Aiken 2021), which is also similar to the core obligations and demands of employees (Lesener et al. 2020).

# Mediation effects of the emotional exhaustion and the original mastery approach

This study verified the mediation effect of mastery approach on the relationship between academic support and commitment to research career. As for the mediation effects of mastery approach, the results indicated that graduate students’ research motivation could significantly promote the positive impact of academic support on their research career aspiration. This resonates with previous findings that motivated graduate students thrive in research careers when they receive sufficient academic support (Chang, Wu, and Ye 2022; Martinsuo and Turkulainen 2011). As mentioned in the literature review, the mastery approach, the catalyst for motivation, was related to the desire for competence and the pursuit of academic success (Singh et al. 2022). Graduate students with strong motivation tend to regard the research as meaningful and behave actively to seek growth opportunities, leading to a high level of dedication to research-oriented careers that align with their aspirations (Chang, Wu, and Ye 2022). Unexpectedly, the mediating role of mastery approach in the relationship between perceived stress and career commitment was not significant. Meanwhile, the direct effect of perceived stress on mastery approach was not significant. These results indicated that the motivation of graduate students was not easily depleted by research pressure and was relatively stable. This is inconsistent with previous studies which supported that graduate students inevitably doubt their abilities in the face of tough challenges, resulting in a lack of confidence and motivation to continue their research activities (Allen et al. 2021; Schwartz-Mette 2009). On one hand, graduate students generally choose their research directions according to interests and passion, which fosters the firm intrinsic motivation of their research (Deemer et al. 2009). This motivation may reduce the detrimental effects of extrinsic stress and make them persist through challenges (Amida, Algarni, and Stupnisky 2021). On the other hand, graduate students are able to realize that they are in fierce and continuous competition and tend to adopt coping strategies to handle the high-level research stress (El-Ghoroury et al. 2012).

The mediation effects of emotional exhaustion had no practical significance on account of the low effect sizes, indicating that emotional exhaustion alone may not completely explain how research characteristics of graduate students influence their commitment to research career. This fails to correspond to previous studies that support the essential role of mental health in research outcomes of graduate students (Brown, Anderson-Johnson, and Mcpherson 2016). It is probably because graduate students’ research characteristics may affect their research commitment through a series of internal and external factors that compensate for the negative effect of emotional exhaustion (Singh et al. 2022). For example, other motivational or psychological factors such as mastery approach play an important role in helping graduate students focus on research pursuits and overcoming negative emotions (Deemer et al. 2009). Meanwhile, unpaid graduate students may respond differently to stress and support according to their individual differences and personal experiences (Woolston 2022). Graduate students who are able to cope with stress well or have high emotional resilience may view stress as challenging opportunities for personal growth (El-Ghoroury et al. 2012), and those who have emotional vulnerability and poor professional foundation may still experience burnout even with sufficient support (Schwartz-Mette 2009).

# Limitations and suggestions for future studies

As an exploratory attempt to apply the JD-R theory among graduate students, this research has the following limitations that have the potential to provide suggestions for future studies. First, the data of this study were graduate students’ self-reports, resulting in the possible existence of response bias due to participants’ different perceptions of research characteristics and emotions. Thus, multiple methods of data collection, such as interviews and observations are considered to avoid this bias and obtain more accurate and comprehensive data for triangulation. Second, the cross-sectional design of this study may demonstrate the inadequacy of comprehensively testing the causal relationships between variables. Future research may have the consideration of using a longitudinal design to verify the causality of variables. Third, considering the potential limitations posed by convenience sampling, the representativeness of samples could be improved in future research to enlarge the generalizability of results.

# Implications

The study has practical implications for improving research conditions of graduate students to promote their research enthusiasm and commitment. First, given the negative impact of graduate students’ perceived stress on their emotions and research career commitment, universities should be aware of graduate students’ perceived stress in the research process and take effective measures to intervene and relieve their pressures and potential passive emotions. For example, universities could create an open and convenient communication platform for research where students may feel comfortable discussing research challenges and receiving counseling services. And financial assistance such as research scholarships and access to research facilities could help reduce graduate students’ burden and stress.

Second, the positive impact of academic support on the mastery approach and research career commitment indicates that graduate students need sufficient guidance to stimulate motivation for academic research. Supervisors could highlight the communication with students and set reasonable research tasks for them. And they could provide effective guidance, appropriately supervise students’ research progress, and provide timely feedback and encouragement.

Last but not least, the mediation effects of mastery approach encourage graduate students to foster a studious attitude and fully utilize academic resources to promote personal growth. For example, they could actively seek assistance from supervisors and peers to overcome research challenges. They could seize opportunities to broaden their scientific horizons by participating in academic conferences, which help them better explore their research interests and choose suitable research directions.
