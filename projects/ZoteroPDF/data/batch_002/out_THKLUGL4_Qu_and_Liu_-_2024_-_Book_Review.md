Wei, Xing (2023). Exploring the cross-language transfer of L1 rhetorical knowledge in L2 writing: Cognitive and metacognitive perspectives (pp. 243). Springer.

Languages vary in the way of presenting information or the use of rhetorical devices. For example, Chinese and English are different in the positioning of the thesis statement in argumentative essays. In many Western academic traditions, writers often assume that readers are unfamiliar with the topic and therefore must be convinced through explicit reasoning and detailed evidence. In contrast, in some East Asian rhetorical traditions, such as those influenced by classical Chinese or Japanese writing styles, persuasion may be more modest or subtle, relying on anecdotes or observations from well-known cultural icons. Influenced by contrastive analysis, the field of contrastive/intercultural rhetoric (Kaplan, 1966) emerged, maintaining that language and writing are cultural phenomena, and differences in rhetorical structures across languages could result in difficulties in second language (L2) learning. An underlying factor is rhetorical transfer, a mental phenomenon triggered by using rhetorical knowledge of a first language (L1) in L2 writing situations. The transfer concerns both cognition (the mental process of thinking, learning, and understanding) and metacognition (the ability to be aware of one’s cognitive processes and to regulate them). Interlingual transfer is a focal point in English as a Second Language (ESL) writing research. However, few studies have adopted a holistic approach to examining rhetorical transfer’s cognitive and metacognitive mechanisms.

Xing Wei’s Exploring the Cross-Language Transfer of L1 Rhetorical Knowledge in L2 Writing investigates this transfer in the case of Chinese ESL learners, focusing on the interplay between cognition and metacognition. As Chinese ESL learners, teachers, and researchers, the reviewers found this monograph informative and insightful. The first reviewer, a PhD student in applied linguistics, reflected on her 15-year journey of learning ESL, and this book deepened her understanding of rhetoric transfer and its underlying mechanisms. The second reviewer, an ESL writing teacher and researcher, saw the book as an opportunity to better understand how Chinese university students learn ESL rhetoric, and what individual factors are involved in their rhetoric transfer process. Wei offers theoretical insights and practical applications for ESL writing research and teaching. He employs a product-based and process-oriented approach, which will be detailed below.

The monograph is structured into eight chapters. Chapter 1 provides a background introduction and Chapter 8 summarizes the key findings. Chapter 2 critically reviews the literature on composition and contrastive rhetoric and rhetorical transfer across languages. It explores the measurement of rhetoric-relevant metacognition, shedding light on the cognitive dynamics involved in this transfer related to the metacognitive knowledge and skills of L2 writers. It also presents a practical trichotomy of Chinese rhetorical features, highlighting the differences between Chinese and English argumentative writing. This includes rhetorical means and strategies for argument construction such as delaying or concealing the subpoint connected to the premise of an argument, as well as rhetorical techniques aimed at achieving specific discourse effects in argumentation.

Chapter 3 introduces a theoretical framework encompassing three dimensions: text, L2 writer, and target reader. The first dimension reflects the textual outcomes of characteristic Chinese rhetorical features emerging from composing activities. The second focuses on the agent of transfer or the transferor, and the last is related to the evaluation made by writing assessors. It serves as a guiding tool for the empirical research conducted by the author. By integrating textual, cognitive, and metacognitive perspectives, Wei situates the explicit features and dynamic nature of the process of rhetorical transfer in L2 writing within a multifaceted model.

The study, reported in Chapters 4–7, employs a sequential mixed-methods design, using seven instruments, including self-designed questionnaires, to collect diverse data such as text samples, evaluations, and self-reports, ensuring strong data triangulation. In the quantitative phase, participants completed English and Chinese writing tasks alongside questionnaires to investigate rhetorical transfer patterns, metacognitive awareness, and perceptions of writing difficulty. This phase also explored correlations between these individual factors and writing performance. The qualitative phase followed with in-depth surveys of sixteen students, offering insights into how rhetorical transfer manifested in their English writing processes and how metacognitive skills played a role. By synthesizing both phases, the study provides a comprehensive understanding of L1-to-L2 rhetorical transfer, highlighting key cognitive and metacognitive factors, such as perceived writing difficulty and proficiency in both L1 and L2, and their influence on L2 writing. The findings emphasize both shared and unique aspects of rhetorical transfer among L2 writers, though further exploration of the interaction between these factors could offer deeper insights.

Contrasting with earlier literature, this book proposes that L2 writers’ perception of difficulty in English writing, which may increase cognitive load, could lead to positive rhetorical transfer. Learners might favorably use L1 rhetorical resources, specifically around two-thirds of the nine subtypes of features outlined in Chapter 2 (p. 58). Additionally, it is argued that proficiency levels in L2 writing may influence the extent to which the L1 counterpart is engaged during the writing process. This resonates with the convoluted L2 writing experiences of the first reviewer. She used to subconsciously rely on Chinese rhetorical knowledge to organize her English argumentative writing, resulting in unnatural texts. After reading this book, she gained a better understanding of the effects of perceived L2 writing difficulty on L1-to-L2 rhetorical transferring processes and realized that L1 thinking patterns, often unavoidable, could be strategically harnessed during L2 text construction.

Wei’s book presents evidence supporting the existence of a self-regulatory mechanism concerning metacognitive knowledge and skills. Learners’ metacognitive awareness of their English-speaking audience’s expectations could positively influence the use of L1 rhetorical knowledge in L2 writing. Relevant metacognitive knowledge could empower learners to strategically harness their intellectual resources to construct arguments, mitigating the interference of L1 rhetorical patterns.

This monograph contributes to our understanding of L2 writers’ agency and metacognition through its innovative threedimensional theoretical framework. It sheds light on the intricate dynamics of cognition and metacognition involved in transferring rhetorical strategies from L1 to L2. Encompassing textual, cognitive, and metacognitive dimensions, the framework provides a synthesized view of rhetorical transfer from L1 to L2, its distribution in L2 writing and compositional processes, its relationship to L2 writer-related factors, and its impact on writing performance. Although previous research has revealed the vital role of self-awareness and self-control in knowledge transfer, the relationship between metacognitive awareness and interlingual rhetorical transfer remains unclear. To fill the research gaps, this new framework explains the role of L2 writers’ agency and individual factors in using L1 rhetorical knowledge in an L2 context. By focusing on both textual products and text producers in context, Wei echoes Liu and Du (2018), who emphasized the importance of an emic perspective and an expanded methodological repertoire in intercultural rhetoric research.

In contrast to the traditional research on contrastive rhetoric that claims the use of L1 rhetorical styles in L2 writing negatively affects the quality of L2 writing (especially at the organizational level), Wei proposes that, from a metacognitive perspective, rhetorical transfer from L1 to L2 is not necessarily harmful. On the contrary, L1 rhetorical knowledge can be helpful in L2 writing, and this process is monitored by metacognition, of which self-agency is a vital component. Wei obtained evidence supporting previous research on Asian ESL learners. Kim (2005) and Kubota (1998) had already established a positive correlation between rhetorical transfer and L2 writing performance in Japanese and Korean students. Of the nine subtypes of rhetorical features in Chinese yilunwen or argumentative essays, only three—ISCO (Indirect Statement of Central Opinion), TEAA (Turn for Encompassing Altered Angles), and DCSCPAb (Concealing the Main Idea or Central Theme of the Body Paragraph)—were found to negatively impact students’ writing in English (p. 201). This finding implies that ESL writing instructors should refine their approach to make learners more aware of the differences between Chinese and English rhetorical devices using metacognition to encourage positive and avoid negative transfer.

Wei’s book clearly explains how L1 and L2 proficiency could influence rhetoric, its impact on the development of ESL writing, and the level of metacognitive engagement among Chinese students. His research findings suggest that ESL writing curricula could be tailored to match learners’ L2 proficiency levels and grasp of metacognitive knowledge and skills.

This study also reveals variations in transfer patterns among Chinese students. For instance, learners with lower proficiency levels often mention the role of Chinese rhetorical techniques and logic in organizing their thoughts and making them feel comfortable in their L2 writing because they can employ specific and explicit strategies. In contrast, those with higher proficiency prioritize the development of arguments to compensate for a lack of familiarity with different writing genres. Higher proficiency learners rely less on L1 rhetoric, while lower proficiency learners rely on it more. As an ESL writing teacher, the second reviewer believes that she could encourage her students to actively utilize L1 rhetorical resources in L2 writing, and cultivate their awareness of differences and similarities in rhetorical structures between L1 and L2. Furthermore, this offers inspiration for adopting differentiated instruction and individual feedback in line with learners’ L1 and L2 writing proficiency.

This book reinforces Forbes’ (2019) assertion that discrepancies in metacognitive engagement related to rhetoric occur across different levels of English proficiency during the writing process. Proficient learners exhibit better metacognitive skills and can better evaluate the effectiveness of argumentative patterns and the rhetorical expectations of English readers.

Wei equally makes a methodological contribution to the study of ESL writing. The author has innovatively adopted a processoriented and product-based approach to study rhetorical transfer, making his analysis more reliable. His approach helps identify rhetorical transfer more accurately and evaluates its impact. Indeed, with careful operationalization measurements under the umbrella of his theoretical framework, Wei argues that rhetorical transfer from L1 to L2 can be examined by combining the following aspects: textual outcome (distinctive rhetorical features of L1), cognitive process (participants’ verbal reports of their thoughts related to rhetorical knowledge of L1), and metacognitive knowledge and skills (participants’ self-reports of contrastive rhetorical awareness and self-regulation of this transfer process). By combining qualitative and quantitative methods, Wei increased the reliability of his findings and set an example for mixed-methods research and data triangulation. For instance, the questionnaire results in Chapter 5 were confirmed by a finding from the retrospective reports in Chapter 6: high-proficiency learners used metacognitive knowledge and skills to prevent negative transfer more successfully.

Two questionnaires the author designed proved effective. He employed rigorous data analysis methods, such as the stepwise method, to ensure an objective inclusion and exclusion of variables in his models, thus minimizing the possibility of human bias. One of these questionnaires, the Post-Writing Retrospective Questionnaire (PWRQ), was developed to delve into the cognitive processes underlying the transfer of rhetorical structures from Chinese (L1) to English (L2) during writing. The item statements in this tool are specifically targeted at recalling conscious awareness of writing processes, distinguishing it from similar questionnaires that often request subjective student comments. The Metacognitive Knowledge of Chinese-English Rhetorical Differences Questionnaire (MKCERDQ) centers on understanding the metacognitive knowledge related to rhetorical differences between the L1 and the L2. Unlike traditional questionnaires on general metacognition (e.g., Ong, 2014), the MKCERDQ does not purely depend on the researcher’s subjective assumptions to formulate its items. Instead, it utilizes online data collection to gather exploratory data. The second reviewer, as an ESL writing researcher, finds that these tools and methodologies could facilitate her further explorations of rhetorical transfer among Chinese university students (both English and non-English majors) to gain a more comprehensive understanding of L2 English learning.

Concerns may arise regarding the theoretical framework outlined in Chapter 3. Firstly, it is necessary to clarify L2 writers’ perceptions of the difficulties encountered in L2 writing. It would have been beneficial to accompany the figure of this framework (p. 90) with a footnote or explanation distinguishing between cognitive and metacognitive knowledge. The author defines the perception of L2 writing difficulty as a perceived task difficulty (cognitive knowledge), which is distinct from L2 writers’ self-awareness. Nevertheless, in Chapter 6, the participants’ sense of task difficulty was integrated into their metacognitive awareness of L2 writing (p. 186). This might confuse readers, thus necessitating clarification. Secondly, to enrich the theoretical framework, consideration could be given to incorporating another cognitive factor: the perception of L2 writing requirements. This concerns writers’ perception of the type, genre, and style of writing tasks from an objective perspective, referring to the task information rather than the perceptual sense.

As an L2 writing researcher, the second reviewer holds that the observed divergences between learners at various L2 proficiency levels (such as rhetoric transfer patterns and rhetoric-related metacognitive engagement) could be further validated by collecting data from additional Chinese participants, including primary and secondary school students, or using longitudinal studies. For instance, Zhang and Zhang’s (2023) latent class growth modeling shows that intermediate L2 writers, unlike beginners, use global lexical cohesion rather than local cohesive devices to link their passages. This tendency reflects an influence from the logical or semantic coherence observed in Chinese writing. By employing such modeling techniques and examining longitudinal evidence, we could enrich our current knowledge regarding the diverse developmental trajectories of learners. Incidentally, this approach is consistent with the author’s process-oriented perspective.

This book contributes to L2 writing pedagogy by examining rhetorical transfer from Chinese to English holistically. It leads to new insights into the cognitive and metacognitive aspects of the Chinese context. Based on interdisciplinary methods, Wei’s book enhances our understanding of the mechanisms of rhetorical transfer from L1 to L2. It provides a theoretical framework, a product- and processoriented approach, and a valuable survey. We highly recommend this book to those studying foreign language writing and intercultural rhetoric.
