An array of pictorial supports (e.g., emojis, geometrical figures, animals) is often used in studies assessing young students' writing motivation with Likert scales. However, although these images may influence the students' responses, sufficient rationales for these choices are often absent from the studies. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to investigate two different types of pictorial support (circles vs. faces) in Likert scales assessing first and third graders' writing interest, self-concept, and spelling interest and self-efficacy. The samples consist of 2197 first graders (mean age 6.8 years) and 1740 third graders (mean age 8.4 years). Results show statistically significant differences among the scales indicating that when face-scales are used. first-graders skip motivation items more often, and students in both grades avoid the minimum values of the scale more often. Gender differences are also found indicating that when face-scales are used, boys in third grade avoid maximum values more often, and girls in both grades avoid the minimum values more often. These findings suggest that the use of circle-scales compared to face-scales seem more appropriate in scales measuring young students' writing and spelling interest and self-beliefs.

# 1. Introduction

To date, the field of writing motivation research lacks consensus not only on how motivation constructs are defined (Camacho et al. 2021), but also on how they are measured and operationalized (Alves-Wold, Walgermo, McTigue, & Uppstad, 2023). Even less attention has been given to how valid scales for measuring these constructs with young children should be designed. Although the literature provides some theoretical and general directions for constructing e.g., self-efficacy scales (Bandura, 2006), guidelines are ofen not accompanied by sufficient empirical support. In addition, pragmatis and convenience tend to guide researchers design of motivation scales. For instance, one common practice in the field is that when measuring motivation with young children, pictorial supports like emojis, geometrical figures, and animals are used, but a recent review of assessments of writing motivation with K-5 students (lves-Wold et l., 2023)shows that despite an array of ictorial supports being used in these asessments, valid rationales for these choices are often missing. This is in contras to recommendations made by Kane (2006, p. 24) who cautions that test tass should not be "overly influenced by extraneous factors (e.g., test format).' To address this gap, the present study is, to the best of our knowledge, th first empirical investigation that compares two different types of pictorial supports - pecifically crces vs. faes - and explores the potential inluence of such extraneous factors on students' responses regarding their writig interest, elf-concept, and spelling interest and self-efficacy.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Why do we need to assess students' writing motivation?

Although the extent and frequency to which young children should be tested in school remain an unresolved sue (Green et al. 2022), the use of rlatively short screning tes has been promoted as valuable and ess invasive tol for identifying underachieving students at risk of developing lening dificulties (Greenet al., 2022; Solheim et al., 2021; Walgemo, stad, Lundetre, Tnnessen, & Solheim, 2021). However,athough measuring the students skill levels is necessary for identifying and addressing specifc skil limitations, we know from motivation research that only targeting the students' skill is not sufficient. Since the $\displaystyle { 1 9 8 0 s }$ motivational factors, such as the students' interests and beliefs, have received increased emphasis as neessary ingredients for the development of adequate litrcy skill (Hidi & Boscoo, 2008). Tht is literacy suces is dendent on the deloment of both skls and motivation (Graham et al., 2007; McTigue et al., 2019). Consequently, to capture a broader picture of the students' needs in their literacy development, it is also necessary to measure their motivation levels.

Still, despite an increased focus on motivation in educational context, motivation is seldom assessed in national screening tests. This is surprising, given that underachieving students - the target group of screening tests - often also report lower leves of interest (Graham et al., 1993). We thus argue that to get a better picture of these students' complex needs, motivational lels should also be assessed alongside sil levels in literacy screening tests. Moreover, as suggested by Walgermo and Uppstad (2023), measuring motivation constructs like interest and self-beliefs may have beneficialeffects for learning, as it contributes to an increased focus on these constructs in learning situations in addition to providing teachers with useful information on the students actual motivational states.

With regards to writing motivation, in particular, studies show that students often report lower levels of motivation to write compared to reading (Babayigit, 2019 Graham et al., 2012; Mata, 2011; Merisuo-Storm, 206; Perr et al., 2003). This means that it is of particular importance to have valid tols to provide teachers and researchers with sound information about students' levels of writing motivation.

# 2.2.  Writing interest and self-beliefs

The motivation constructs investigated in the present study are intentional, as these two broad components of writing motivation, namely interest and self-beliefs, represent two of the most research-supported aspects of literacy motivation in the early grades (Alves-Wold et al., 2023; Troia et al., 2012). In this section, these two constructs wil be defined and their relevance for the devel. opment of writing skills and motivation will be briefly presented.

Interest is commonly divided between situationdl and individual (or personal) interest, where the former is more fluctuating and triggered by spific characteristics of tasks, and the ltter tends to be more stable a it riginate from individual preferences towards tasks or domains (Hidi et al., 2002; Troia et al., 2012). For instance, a student may have low interest in writing argumentative texts (individual interest) but writing a text to his or her parents arguing as to why the student should beallowed to play a specific game may awake the students' interest in writing this type of text (situational interet). Acording to Hidi et al., (2002, p. 430) situationl neest \*is generated by certain conditions and/or stimuli inthe environment and it represents a relatively immediat affective reaction that focuses atention and that may not be long term," whereas individual intrest concerns a relatively enduring individual disposition to re-engage with certain objects and events."

Different studies have shown that interest (both situational and individual) positively affects academic learning and facilitates writing performance (Z-H. Chen & Liu, 2019; . H. Hall et al, 2017; Hidi et l., 2002; Liao et al., 2018). Another important aspect of interest is that it i not static, that is, it is malleable and can be developed, but \*without self-generated or environmental support for continued engagement, it s also possble, for a person's interest in something to decrease or drop off altogether (Reninger & Hidi. 2017, p. 12). In educational setings, this is of particular importance, because even though students may show ittle interest towards specific tasks (e.g., structuring essays) or broader domains (e.g., writing), with support from their teachers, their interest can be developed, which can positively affect their motivation levels and consequently their writing skills development.

Although interest i  strong motivational factor for writing (Bruning & Horn, 200), research shows that the eles individuals have about themselves, ie., self-beliefs, are also an important ingredient in the development of individuals' writing motivation (Graham, 2018; Trt l., 2012). h  elf-belesis coy u raoveeg oiffe ty f bee inviduals have about themselves (Mcie et a., 2019; Pajares e al., 199; Wright et al., 2019. These can refer to more general belefs towards a domain (eg., writin self-concept), as wellas more focused beliefs towards specific tass (e.g., spelling self-eficy). In adition, Pajares and Valiante (2001, p. 367) remark the importance of self-worth beliefs for writing self-concept and define it as one's udgements of self-worth associated with ones self-percetion as  writer, while elf-eficacy concerns individuals convictions about their capabilities in suceding wth more speific actvitie  idtio selfefficcy or accomplishing tas , selfefficacy for poetry writing).

As remarked by Troia e l., (2012, p. 8), slf-concept and self-efficacy belies may vary from each other. For example, a student can have positive self-belies about his or her competence towards the broad domain of writing (1 believe I am a good writer' - i.e., positive writing self-concept), bt have more aried blef rardng spcific taks or kill think that was not able to spell properly the wos xt i eig effficy. ik int, ft dfffice  malae andcan be developed (Bandura, 1997). However, whereas self-eficacy beliefs tend to be more mallable and futur-oriented, self-concept appears to be more stable and oriented towards past experiences (Bong & Skaalvik, 203; Troia e al., 2012; Unrau et al., 2018). I fact, as suggested by Unrau et al., (2018, p. 169), elfefficacy \*ct as a precursor to the development f self-concet. hat i, as an individual experieces mastery with task-specific activitie, like successully stuctring paragraphs, spelling words, or writing an essay, the individual will develop belef about his or her eficacy in successully accomplishing theseactivities. hese collective beliefs may in turn strengthen the individual's general self-perception within the broader domain of writing, ie., the individual's writer self-concept.

This understanding of self-efficacy as forerunner for writer elf-concept is important in educational seting, as each small writing task students encounter may add a brick to their broader writer elf-concept puzzle. As proposed by Walgermo and Uppstad (2023), in classroms we should therfore \*work hands-on in every learning situation so as to strengthen students feeling of mastery when they are engagd in thir daily redng and wrig tassand, importnl, this inludes aments For th techer, mindul aesment of students' writing interest and self-beliefs is of potential great value, as these motivational factors inluence students subsequent desire or decision to re-engage with writing tass (Renninger & Hidi, 2017) and \*are positively related to the amount of ffrt expended to perform a task, perstence with a diffcult task, the recruitment f srategies to accomplis atask, and actual task performance, regardless of one's age, gender, or ethnicity (Troia et al., 2012, p. 6). However, for teachers and researchers to obtain accurate information regarding the students' interest and beliefs, valid assessment instruments are needed.

# 2.3. Assessing young students' writing interest and self-beliefs

The use of self-reports with young children has been debated, as there is discussion regarding reliability ssues like children's overestimation of their abilities, and their limited capacity and lack of opportunities for comparing themselves with other children, as well as with thir own previous performances (Mata, 2011, p. 289). However, many researchers have advocated for the importance and richnes of childrensself-reported data (Alves-Wold t l., 2023; .H. Hall & xelrod, 2014; Zumbrunn et al., 2017), and from the literature reviewed, Sturgess et al., (2002, p. 115) argue that \*there is convincing evidence that the use of elf-report with young children is valid, desirable and helpful, and that slf-reports have been demonstrated to be reliable in many instances and contexts." In addition, various studies have shown that children in primary grades are indeed able to give an indication of their motivations to write (Graham et al, 2012; Mata, 2011), even though some may lack a more robust vocabulary to express themselves (Paquette, 2008)

Depending on the type f information that researchers wish to investigate regarding students writing motivation, different types of self-report have been used to generate data, includng surveys (e.g., Bayat, 2016; Li et a., 2018), questionnaires (e.g., Jones e al., 2016; Kanala et al., 2013), interviews (e.g., Abott, 2000; Beck & Fetherston, 203), and drawings (e.g., Zumbrunn et al., 2017). In their review of writing motivational measures for K-5 students, Alves-Wold et al. (2023, p. 23) point out that quantitative assessment methods, like cales, were ofe sed to measure frequencies and lels that is ow ofte students worked with writing activities and how much they enjoyed or valued these activities," whil qualitative asessments like open-ended questions in interviews and surveys, were used to investigate reasons for their [the students] choices and factors that influenced those choices."

Although qualitative methods are also used for investigating students writing interest and self-beliefs (A. H. Hall  Axelrod, 2014; Kim & Lorsbach, 2005; Zumbrunn et al., 2017), when it comes t large samples, these motivational constructs are often asessed in terms of levels, in which quantitative methods are then commonly used. When measuring student' levels of interest, questions in which students indicate how much they like or enjoy) writing in general or pecific writing activities are commonly used (e.g., Boscolo et al., 2012). Levels of writing self-belef are, in turn, sometimes measured through questions in which students indicate how good they think they are to writ in general (writing self-oncept) or when executing specific writing tasks (task-specific self-fficacy , S. D. Miller & Meece, 1997). Selfeficy is also measured through statements, in which students indicate their lel of confidence at executing the tasks described in the statments, like " can red through my text and correct spelling mistakes" (Grener et al., 2020, p. 3). Often, to cature these levels, Likert-scales ranging for instance from \*not at all o very much' (.g., Hier & Mahony, 2018) ae used, and with young students, these scales are accompanied by pictorial supports (e.g, geometrical figures ranging from small to ig, or face ranging from sad happy) to help the stdes visualize dffrent reonse levels (e. Babayigit, 2019, Grner et al., 2020, Jones et al., 2016).

These pictorial supports can be seen as an aid for students to rate their responses, but they may also indicate a source of bias, as these images themselves may inluence the students' responses. For instance, in a study on pain ratings, Chambers and Craig (1998) found that the type of fce (i. smiling or neutral face to indicate no pain) used in the cales influenced the childrens slf-reported ratings of pain, and that the biasing impact was more pronounced among younger children (5-8 years old) compared to their older peers (9-12 years old). Similar biases related to the type of face scale used were reported by L. Hall et al. (2016), in astudy ines. tigating children's (9-11 years old) evaluations of an interactive narrative (serious game). According to the authors, results showed that children avoided selecting the negative options of the scale, even when a neutral face was used as the end point.

Although there are limited studies on the use f face-scales, a growing number of studies (Gallo t al., 2017; Schouteten et al., 2018; Setty et al., 2019) have investigated the use of emojis, which are \*small icons used in digital communication to expres emotions/- feelings" (Sick et al., 2020, p. 1). Thesestudies have also found gender differences in emoji use. For example, in a study investigating the use of emojis to indicat food preferences among 9-13-year-old children, Sick et al. (2022) found gender differences in the participants' responses, in which girls $( 7 4 \% )$ showed greater preference towards positive emojis than boys $( 6 4 \% ) ( { \bf p } = 0 . 0 2 3 )$ . In fact, in 2018, Z. Chen et al. (2018) argued that gender differences were not only statisticall significant, machine learning algorithms were already at that time able to deduce the gender of a person solely on the basis of the emojis inserted in the text. Sick et al. (2020) also note that gender differences in emoji preferences should be seen in relation to gender differences in non-verbal communication and emotion expression, since meta-analytc reviews indicate that girls tend to express more positive emotions compared to boys (Kring & Gordon, 1998), and more intenalized emotions (g., fear an sadnes), compared to more exteralized emotions (e., anger) expressed by boys (Chaplin & Aldao, 2013).

With regards to motivation measures in particular, Bandura (2006, p. 313) has also brought attention to a potential bias fect related to face-scales, and the author rcommends avoiding face-scales ranging from happy to sad for ratings of self-eficacy belies as children \*'may misread such a scaleas measuring their happines or sadness rather than how confident they are that they can perform given tasks.' For this matter, the author recommends for example a circle-scale instead, ranging from smallr to bigger circles. However, although studies like the ones mentioned above have investigated potential influences of the design of face-scales on children's responses, to the best of our knowledge, the present investigation is the first empirical study to compare circle- and face-scales and their potential influence on measures of writing motivational constructs.

Finally, although examining student' response patterns is necessary in investigations of scale validity, scholars have brought attention to the importance of also investigating students' lack of responses, i., their skipping behavior in low-stakes assesments. For instance, in an investigation of non-serious behavior in the Programme for International Student Assment (PIsA), Akyol e al. (2021) uses the students' skipping behavior (i.e., not answering questions) as one of their markers for non-seriousnes, and found tht grls were les likely to expres n-srious behavior. Similarly, Liu  Hau, 2020, p. 1121) argue that if students intentionally ski items (i. e., user missingnes), such missingnessinformation may be seen as n indicationof (lack of est-taking motivation. The authors also remark that it is important to explore potential reasons of missingness, like slow answering pace, which commonly leads to non-reached items at the end of the test, or issues related to the design of the test. For example, in an investigation of a Turkish universty entrance exam, Akyol et al. (2022) found that skipping behavior was associated with an important feature of the test design, which was the inclusion of penalties for choosing wrong answers. The authors found gender diffrences regarding skipping behavior and risk taking, and noted that although females were significantly more averse to risk, the effct of gender was small, favoring the inclusion of higher guessing penalties for increasing the precision of the exam. However, even though a few studies have examined the significance f students skipping behavior in low-stakes asessments, none have examined this behavior in relation todifferent types of scales. Thus, in the present study, we also investgate whether the students' skipping behavior in the writing interest and self-beliefs items may be related to the type of pictorial support used in the test, that is if scale types may lead to more or less skipping.

# 2.4. The present study

The present study is undertaken as part of the development of a new national literacy screning test in Norway for first and third graders. This test has been developed by the Norwegian Centre for Reading Education and Research as requested by the Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training (NDET) with the purpose of helping teachers identify students who need extra support to develop adequate reading and writing skills.

Although NDET recommends the completion of this test to all schools, participation in first grade is voluntary, both at school and individual levels. That is, school administrators are allowed torfrain from implementing this test in their schools, and in cases where teachers do not se the completion of this test as benefici for individual students ., students with disailities, or students who do not comprehend the Norwegian language), these students are offered alternative activities and do not have to participate in this screening test. Inaddition, in order not to force students to answer tass that they are not comfortale with answerig or do not want to answer, NDET requires that the design of the test must allow students to skip tasks.

Following the common practice of using pictorial support (e.g., geometrical figures, emojis, animals) in Likert scales when assesing young children's writing motivation through self-reports, the present study uses two types of pictorial support separately:circes and faces (as shown in Fig. 1), where we investigate whether these types of pictorial support influence the students' responses.

The research question guiding this investigation is as follows: Do students report, or skip reporting, levels of writing interest and self beliefs ifeentl deending on the type of pictoril support used in the Likert scales If so, to what extent are the diffeences explained y grade, gender, and type of motivational construct measured?

To investigate this research question, two hypotheses have been formulated, and here we present the reasoning for them. First given that in the present study, students are allowed to skip items, we hypothesize that students may choose to skip items that they do not feel comfortable with answering, or that they are not sufficiently motivated to answer. According to Bandura (2006), face-scales tap into the respondents emotional register more than circle-scales. Consequently, providing ratings about one's interest and self-eliefs may be more costly when face-scales are used. Therefore, we expect higher kipping rates among students when face-scales are used.

Second, fllowing the proposition of Bandura (2006), we argue that the extreme ends of the face-scale are more emotionally loaded than the middle, more neutral options. Based on this assumption of the emotional load of face-scales, we thus expect more avoidance of the extreme ends when these are used in comparison with circle-scales.

Fig.1.   st  d c.   ss r  n   gto small.

Specificall, in the present study, we thus evaluate whether data supports the following two hypotheses:

$\mathbf { H } _ { 1 }$ . : We hypothesize that the students likelihood of skipping motivation items will be significantly higher for the face-scale compared to the circle-scale.

$\mathbf { H } _ { 2 }$ : We hypothesize that, when not skipping, students will tend to use the scale extremes to a lesser degree with the face-scale compared to the circle-scale.

If confirmed, these hypotheses can be an indication that - due to their emotional load - face-scales are les optimal for measuring students writing interest and self-beliefs, as they may lead to higher levels of skipping behavior (i.e., missing data) and avoidance of extreme ends, when compared to circle-scales.

# 3. Method

# 3.1. Study context

As part of the development of a new national literacy screening test, students from different Norwegian schools were asked to complete a digital booklet comprising four short sections: word reading, spelling, reading comprehension, and language comprehension. Each student carried out two booklets within a period of 2 weeks, and had $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ to complete each booklet in their respective classrooms. The structure of the booklets, containing the four short sections mentioned above, was the same in both weeks, but the tasks included in each section contained of course different texts to be read and interpreted, and different words tobe spelled. Given the focus of the present study, data for our investigation was derived from the spelling section of the test.

Although a myriad of tasks (e., composing narrative or informative texts, writing shopping list, or birthday cards) can be used to operationalie writing in writing assessments, speling is chosen for this purpose in the present screening tes for two reasons. First given the aim of idenfying students at rik f developig litrc diffiltie, tass with strong prdiction of latr literacy difficulties were needed, and spelling tass have proven to be powerful predictors. For instance, according to Lundetrae and Thomson (2018), although spelling has received les attention in research, t demands a deeper and more actively generatd understanding of written word forms, whichfrequently serves as astronger indicatr of literacy diffitie i alphabetic languages. Moreover, as noted y Troia et a., (2012, p. 13) lower level transcription kills such s spelling and handwriting, exert a powerful influence on how wellstudents accomplish composing tass when thee skill are underdeveloped, and sere thefre ssnificant indicatrs of litracy difiulties Second, given the ambitious am of considerably reducing the length of earlier versions of this national literacy screening test from 60 to $3 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ shorter tasks like spelling tasks were preferred. However, although writing i operationalized as a spelling task in the present test this ask i did omirror high-qulity and mtivating iteray ractice, iwhich the peling task is prtd in an authntic and hopefully motivating scenario, as it will be described in more detail in Section 3.3.2.

Prior to the students participation, teachers led all students through an instruction including sample items representing each of the sections in the test Students then completed the test's tasks by using their individual school digital devices (tablet computers or Chromebooks) during clas. Each participating student was asked to log into the system and complete the literacy test according to onscreen instructions that were read out loud digitlly to them. To hear these instructions all students used headphones during the test.

# 3.3. Measures

# 3.3.1. Writing interest and self-concept

The first task the students encountered in each test booklet was concerned with their general interest and self-oncept for reading and writing. However, as mentioned above, given the focus of the present study, data related to writing, rather than reading, is presented.

The students general interest and sef-concept were each measured using one single item, adapted from Nutil et al. (2020), as described in items 1 and 2 in Table 1.

A picture of students writing, as shown in Fig. 2, accompanied each of these two items. This picture was designed for the students to give their responses according to an elaborated view of writing, which includes both analog and digital writing, as wellas authentic writing activities, like writing wishing or shopping lists.

Both items were measured with a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 5 (Very much) to 1 (Not at all, and as pictorial support, these answers were accompanied by either a face scale (as shown in Fig. 1a) or a circle scale (as shown in Fig. 1b).

# 3.3.2. Authentic word spelling task

After answering the questions regarding their writing (and reading) interest and self-concept, every participant carried out computerized literacy tasks belonging to each of the four short sections of the literacy test, as mentioned above. The sub-section measuring the students'spelling sill consts of 7 words with orthographic transparent and opaque pelig patterns, which reflect the semi-transparent orwegin orthography. For these tasks, apicture of a boy sitig i his rom apeared on the scren (seeFig. 3a). The students were introduced to this boy as Josef', whose birthday is soon coming up, and to which he was really loking forward. Then, the students were asked whether they could help Josef with writing a wishing list for his birthday. For each word in the wishing list, a thought ubble with an ilustration of that word pred to the stdnt, ashown in Fig. 3b, which is a illustraio of the word 'hammock' (hengekoye' in Norwegian). Each word was then read out loud digitally to the student, and they could type in their answers.

# 3.3.3. Interest and self-efficacy for spelling task

Before and after completing these spelling tasks, the students were asked questions regarding their interest and self-efficacy for these tasks, totaling 7 items related to their interest and self-beliefs, as shown in Table 1.

Items 3 to 6 were also measured with a scale ranging from 5 (Very much) to 1 (Not at all, and the same type of pictorial support used for items 1 and 2. However, for item 7, following the lead from Nutilaet al. (2020), we used a 3-point Likert scale with the response options "Yes", "Maybe", and "No".

# 3.4. Study design

All participants responded to these  items twice within a period of two weeks (once in each test booklet), and the order of the scales used in each booklet was reversed, meaning that a flipped design was employed, as shown in Fig. 4. That is, for all 7 items, approximately half of the students were presented with the face-scale in booklet 1, and with the circle-scale in booklet 2 (1146 firstgraders, and 832 third-graders), whereas the other half was presented with the opposite sequence (1051 first-graders, and 908 third. graders). Given that the nature of the present study implies a flipped design,all participating students completed their asigned test booklet 1 (wave 1) before their assigned test booklet 2 (wave 2).

# 3.5. Analysis

Each hypothesis was analyzed first by considering descriptive statistics and then proceeding to statistical modeling and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics are mostly presented visually, relying on plot panels fully crossing grade, wave, gender, and format.

For formal significance testing, we modeled item responses using mixed linear logistic regression. Given that there are significant developmental differences between grade 1 and 3, we chose to model the fixed effects of item and gender in separate grades. This is because there are expected differences in what constitutes interest and self-belief in grade 1 when students have just had their first formal year of literacy instruction compared to grade 3, when these skill are expected to be more established. Running a model with both grades included would mean that we free up fixed effects across grades, leading to a much more complex model, with possibly more unstable estimates. For this reason, we ran separate models in grade 1 and in grade 3. To further support this decision, we calculated the correlation matrices among the 7 items in grade 1 and in grade 3 and tested whether these were equal. This hypothesis was rejected (chi-square ${ \it \Omega } = 2 2 0 . 9 $ with 21 dfs, $\mathbf { p } = \mathbf { 0 } .$ ) by Steiger's test (Steiger, 1980).

Further nesting the students in classes was not possible, as NDET did not allow the collection of class information during this test Let us consider the outcome "skipping" on an item response. The skipping behavior of student $s$ in relation to on item I, in wave W, and under format $F _ { s }$ is modeled by the binary variable $Y _ { I , W , F , s }$ being equal to 1 if a response was skipped, 0 otherwise. The overall likelihood of skipping is alowed to vary between students, and this is modelled by arandom intercept. lso, the change in likelihoodof skipping between waves is alowed to randomly vary between students, and this is modelled by a random slope. The seven motivation items were modeled as fixed effects, with dummy variable coding, using the first item, general interest (INT GEN), as reference.

In summary, the mixed logistic model of $Y _ { I , W , F }$ contains a random effect of wave W ( $W = 0$ and $W = 1$ correspond to wave 1 and 2, respectively), a fixed format effect $F$ $( F = 0$ and $F = 1$ correspond to circle and face, respectively), and a fixed student level gender effect $G _ { s } \left( G _ { s } = 0 \right)$ and $G _ { s } = 1$ correspond to girl and boy, respectively). Of primary concern is whether gender moderates the effect of pictorial support format on responses. We therefore also included a cross-level interaction between $F _ { i }$ and $G _ { w }$ in our mixed model:

$$
^ { \prime } o g i t \big ( Y _ { I , W , F , s } \big ) = \alpha _ { s } + \sum _ { \mathrm { ~ I = 1 ~ } } ^ { 6 } \gamma _ { I } D _ { I } + ( \beta _ { W } + \beta _ { s } ) \mathbf { W } + \beta _ { F } \mathbf { F } + \beta _ { G } G _ { s } + \beta _ { F G } \mathbf { F } \cdot G _ { s } + \epsilon _ { I , W , F , s }
$$

where $\alpha _ { s }$ is a random intercept, and $\beta _ { W }$ and $\beta _ { s }$ are the fixed and random effect of wave, respectively. Also, $\beta _ { F }$ is the fixed format effect for girls, $\beta _ { F } + \beta _ { \mathrm { F G } }$ is the fixed format effect for boys, and $\beta _ { \mathrm { G } }$ is the fixed gender effect for the circle format. The fixed effect of each item, relative to the reference item INT_GEN, is represented by coefficients $\gamma _ { 1 } , . . , \gamma _ { 6 }$ . Given that any effect of wave over and beyond the influence of format is likely small and therfore of litle practical interest in test desig, we do not add the complexity of an interaction $\mathbf { \nabla } \mathbf { W } ^ { * } \mathbf { F }$ in Eq. (1) for reasons of parsimony.

Modeling and plotting were conducted in the R software environment (R Core Team, 2022), using packages Ime4 (Bates et al. 2015) and ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016), respectively.

# 4. Results

Univariate descriptive statistics for the items in Table 1 are presented in Table 2. Corrlations among items within each wave are given in Table 3a, while the repeated measure correlations across waves are presented in Table 3b.

# 4.1. Hypothesis 1

# 4.1.1. Skipping behavior

The number of participants and the percentages of skipping responses (acrossall seven motivation items) over the two adminis tration waves are given in Table 4, for each combination of grade, format, wave, and gender.

The observed skipping pattern is further rfined in Fig. 5, where each of the seven motivation items are separated out. A consistent finding for first graders is that itm skipping occurs more frequently in Wave 2 compared to Wave 1, and skipping consistently occurs more often with the face format compared to the crcle format. Also, the sensitivity to item format is generally more pronounced among boys compared to girls. In grade 3, the differences betwen kipping in Wave 1 and skipping in Wave 2 are generally negligible, as are the differences in skipping between the face and circle formats.

To further inquire into whether the findings in grade 1 reflect significant effcts, we ran a mixed logistic regression model with skipping as the outcome. The estimated model is given in Table 5. The model yielded a significant $( \mathsf { p } < . 1 )$ effect of format, with the face format associated with an incrase in the likelihood of skipping, while significant gender differences were not found. For Grade 3, the effects of Wave are atenuated and opposite to the results for Grade 1 (see Table 6). Moreover, in Grade 3 we found no significant effect of gender nor item format on skipping behavior, and no interaction between gender and item format.

However, although both first and third graders skipped general interest and self-concet items (i.e. INT GE and SC_GE) more often than task-specific items (i.e, INT PRE, SE PRE, INT POST, SE POST, and INT_CONT), only third graders consistently demonstrated significantly less skipping behavior for all 5 task-specific items..

from grade 1 boys in wave 2, it is hard to visually find clear support for $H _ { 2 }$ in this Figure.

To further investigate this hypothesis, estimation of the mixed linear logistic model with endorsement of the max value as outcome variable was conducted (se Table 7 for grade 1). Table 7 shows that first gaders tend to endorse max values more often in Wave 2. Boys endorse max values ignificntly les often than girls but this difference is regardessof the scale format. With regards to scale format, both genders tend to endorse max values to a less extent when face scales are used, and this difference is more pronounced for boys, but these tendencies are not statistically significant.

For grade 3, however, as shown in Table 8, there is a marginally significant moderation of the effect of the face format for boys, that is, the likelihood of endorsing max values in the face scale is significantly les for boys compared to girls.

Finally, estimate values for endorsing max values in both grades are higher for task-specific self-eficacy items (i.e., e PRE and SE POST), than for gneral self-concept and items asesing the students' interest. That is first and third graders endorse max values more often for task-specific items assessing their self-beliefs, rather than their interest and general self-concept.

# 4.2.2. Endorsing minimum values

The observed percentages of endorsing the minimum scale value are presented in Fig. 7. Clearly, boys consistently endorse the minimum value more often than do girls. Also, in wave 1 it is seen consistently that with circles there is a higher percentage of minimum values compared to the face format. Surprisingly, in wave 2, the situation is reversed for boys in grade 1, where the face format is associated with a clearly higher percentage of minimal values.

The model estimates for grade 1 are given in Table 9, and for grade 3 in 10. Similar patterns are found for both grades, in whic. there is les likelihood of choosing the minimum values in the face scale compared to the circe format. However, compared to girls boys in both grades choose the minimum value in face scales more often compared to girls.

Finally, an interesting consistent zigzag pattern can be een in Fig.7, in which students in both grades seem to endorse minimum values lessoften when the items measure their writing self-beliefs (i.e, SC_GE, SE PRE, and SE POST) compared to items measuring their writing interest (i., INTGE, INT PRE, INT POST, and INT CONT). Etimated cofficients for these items reflecting this zigzag pattern are reported in Tables 9 and 10.

# 5. Discussion and implications of findings

The present study set out to investigate whether first and third grade students' responses on measures of writing interest, self concept, and spelling self-eficacy are influenced by the type of pictoril support used in the Likert-scales measuring these constructs. Specificll, we compared results from two scales - faces and circles - and investigated if potential differences could be

explained in relation to the students' grade, gender, and type of pictorial support In this investigation, we hypothesized that students likelihood of skipping motivation items would be significantly higher for the face-scale compared to the circle-scale $\left( H _ { 1 } \right)$ , and that, when not skipping, students would tend to use the cale extremes to a lesser degree with the face-scale compared to the circle-scale $\left( H _ { 2 } \right)$ In this section, we willdiscuss our findings with relation to these two hypotheses, and the implications of these findings for the development of motivation scales for young children.

# 5.1. Skipping behavior

Results from the present study show that Hypothesis 1 i partially supported. That i, boys and girl in firstgrade skip motivational items significantly more often when face-scales are used compared to circle-scales. However, although students in third grade show similar pattens, thediffernce are not statistically ignificant, which may indicate tht the kipping bhavior of third graders is es influenced by the face-scale format. This inding isin line with Chambers and Craig (1998), who found that the biasing effect of the type of face used in thir scales was more pronounced among younger children (5-8 years old) compared to their older peers (9-12 years old).

For third graders, skipping behavior seems to be more related to the type of motivational construct measured. That is even though students in both grades skip motivational items les oft when the are mesuring thir task-specific writing inteest and selfefficacy compared to general writing interest and self-oncept, only third graders consistently show statisticall significant differences. This tendency of responding more frequently to task-specific rather than general motivational items may be related to students' dificulties in interpreting what general items entail. For instance, Wilson and Trainin (2007, p. 275) remarks that researchers have previously identified the propensity to rely on a generalized sense of self-concept as a confounding problem when working with young children." The authors then advocate for the importance of investigating motivation at the task level and of providing young students with concrete tass when asssing their motivations to write as these make the items more concrete and ccessibl to young chldren. When providing students with tasks in such ssessments, Alves-Wold et l.(2023, p. 30) also remark that an overuse of specific writing tasks (e.g, story-writing) in these assessments represent a clear construct-underrepresentation in current research base on motivation to write." The authors then recommend the inclusion of more varied writing tasks in future asessments of writing motivation, which more realistically reflect the myriad of tasks, activities, tools, and genres that writing entails.

However, although first graders also tend to skip task-specific items more often, their skiing behavior is not as consistently statisticall sigificant a for third graders. This aditional dfference betwee first and third graders may be related to their views of what writing - as a general construct - entails. That is studies have shown that younger students often have narrower views of writing, in which writing isoften equated with specific tasks like having neat handwriting or spelling words accurately (Beck & Fetherson, 2003; Kim & Lorsbach, 2005; Paquette e al., 2013). Thus, when answering general items, first graders may picture more concrete and limited tasks than their older peers, which make these items more accessible and easier to interpret.

In addition to interpretation difficulties regarding general items, students skipping behavior may also be linked to characteristics of the constructs measured. For instance, Walgermo and Uppstad (2023) argue that general reading and writing interest and self-conct are much losr rlat to the stdnts rer andwitr idnties. Th i, judging one's interest and elf-efic towards specific tass is emotionally esscostly than rating eneral constructs that are more directed towards ones idntities. orover, providing such ratings about oneself may be more costly when face-scales are used, as acording to Bandura (2006), these types of scales tap into the respondents' emotional register more than circle-scales. In fact, in his renowned book Thinking, Fast and Slow on behavioral economics and cognitive biases, Kahneman (2011) refers to the research of Ekman (2006) and argues that humans assgn stronger value to negative face expressions than positive ones. Further, the author remarks that face expressions are also related to our negativity bias and selfesteem maintenance. This claim is based on research conducted by Baumeister et al.(2001) who found that humans tend to be more influenced by negative events and experiences than positive ones, and that negative emotions and face ex. pressions, such as fear, anger, or sadness, have a stronger impact on our cognition and behavior compared to positive emotions and expressions. On the basis of such studies, Kahneman (2011) argues that to protect ourseles from danger and negative experiences, we assign stronger value to negative face expressions than positive ones and are more motivated to avoid bad self-definitions than to pursue good ones. This asymmetry of negative bias leads researchers to conclude that our brain in evolutionary terms is designed to assign pririt to bad news. Thus, to protect neself from native rresentations f one's idntities, students in the present study may prefer to skip motivation items to avoid choosing negative face expressions to represent themselves.

Finally, as suggested by Liu and Hau (2020, p.1121), students' skipping behavior may also be \*used as a direct measure of (lack of) test-taking motivation. However, in the present study, we speculate whether the students' high frequency of kipping can also be seen as a direct measure of lack of writing motivation. That is, in measures of motivation, skipping test items may be seen not only as an indication of lack of motivation towards test-taking, but also as an indication of low levels of motivation towards the tasks or domains being assessed in the skipped items.

# 5.2. Endorsing extreme values

Results from the present study show that Hypothesis 2 is partially supported with regards to maximum values, but confirmed with regards to minimum values. That i, although the likelihood of endorsing maximum values decrease significantly only for boys in third grade when face-scales were used, the likelihood of endorsing minimum values decreased significantly in both grades when face-scales were used. The significant avoidance of maximum values in face-scales for third-grader boys compared to girls aligns with findings from a meta-analysis conducted by Kring and Gordon (1998), in which it was found that girs tend to expres more positive emotions compared to boys. Thus, it may be easier for girlsto choose positive face expressions from the extreme end of the scales, compared to boys. However, a meta-analysis conducted by Chaplin and Aldao (2013) indicate that boys, in turn, are more likely to express externalizing emotions, like anger, compared to girls, which may explain why i seems to be easier for boys than girs in both grades to choose negative face expressions at the extreme end of the face-scale.

Interestingly, results from the present study also show that students in both grades are significantly more likely to endorse maximum values for items measuring their task-specific self-beliefs compared to their interest, and at the same time less likely to endorse minimum values for the same items (see zigzag pattern in Figs. 6 and 7). This finding indicates that students seem to be more comfortable with choosing the negative end f scaleto rat their intrest towards tks, but may fin it more dfficult to usethe negative end of scales for rating belies about their own competence. Given that assessment situations may also contribute to the students for. mation of their writer identities (Walgermo & Uppstad, 2023), it is important to avoid exposing them to such uncomfortable assessment situations, as they can potentially be harmful for their identities.

# 5.3. Avoiding the biasing effect of face-scales

Results from the present study support the recommendations of Bandura (2006) to avoid face-scales in measures of selfefficacy, and extends these recommendations also to measures of interest and self-concept. The findings discussed here are also in line with prior research on the use of emojis, in which facial expressions were demonstrated to be often open to reinterpretation and misin. terpretation (D. M. Millr et al., 2015). Indeed, from everyday life, we know that a smile can signal a myriad of diffrent underlying emotions. This everyday assumption is underpinned by studies that have found that even within the same cultures, people ften do not add the same meaning to emojis - regardless of whether emojis are presented in context or isolation (H. Millr et al., 2016). These findings may indicate that inroducing fcial expressions in asessments can lead to confusion regarding what the faces actuall mean.

Additionall, this confusion may to a larger degree be evident among boys, and lead to higher skipping rates of items contaning facial expressions, compared to girls. In fact, reearch suggests that females more accurately than males are able to identify emotions from facial expressions, even under conditions of minimal stimulus information (J. A. Hall & Matsumoto, 2004).

Goldshmidt and Wellr (2000) suggest that females in general use significantly more emotional words than males and that such gender differnces in lnguage and emotion stems from the socialization of the sexes. For instance, Kuebli and Fiush (1992) argue that mothers and fathers both tend to use a greater number and variety of emotion words with daughters compared with their sons. Moreover, in the litrature, females have been reported to value, experience, and express emotions more than men (Berghout Austin et al., 1987; Block, 1983; Sprecher & Sedikides, 1993).

Despite these gender differences, results from the present study show that the choice of circle-scales compared to face-scales seem more appropriate for both genders, especiall for first gaders, who seem to be more sensitive to face expressions in scales measuring their writing interest and self-beliefs.

# 5.4. Limitations and future directions

The face-scales used in the present study are quite neutral concerning gender and color. This means that emojis with stronger emotional value e.g, cales rendering from happy green to furious red faces) could potentiall have resulted in more extreme values and larger group differences. However, our choice of faces for measuring motivation for writing were considerate towards the fact that we wanted to limit possibilities for measuring adjacent emotional states to students' motivation for writing. Therfore, in accordance with recommendations of both Bandura (2006) and Kane (2006, p. 24), we aimed to within the two scales as purely as possible measure students' interest and self-beliefs related to writig. In addition, given that these scales are used in national screning tests requested by NDET, these scales need to comply with national regulations regarding universal design, which adds external constraints regarding the shaping of these scales. To comply with these regulations, the shaping of these scales was therefore developed in cooperation with professional graphic designers, where we aimed to create scales that were as neutral as possble. For instance, by avoiding the adition of ifferent colors to the scales. This choice was deliberate to avoid introducing too much "noise" (Kahneman et al., 2021 to the scales, as we aimed to ensure that the distinctions derived from the face-scale remained primaril influenced by the facial expressions themselves, rather than other extraneous factors like color variations.

In order to even more specificlly investigate students peceptions of the two different cale, we could actully also within the est have asked the students: 'Do you prefer answering these tasks with circles or faces? (e.g., giving the students the choice betwen: circles - face -evenually other types of cale). Adding an open-ended question where the test-takers could justfy their choice of scale could also have provided valuable information. Importantly, however, inserting such additional questions would increase the test length and could have possibly challenged the students test stamina. Given that the triggers for the students choices are likely to be partly sub-conscious, it remains an empirical question whether qualitative investigations into students' thoughts afer finishing these tasks might be preferable for gaining more valuable in-depth information about the students' perception of the scales. Additional qualitative ivestigations were originall a part of the preent study desig, but due to Covid-19retrictions, these investigations could not be carried out.

Furthermore, in the present study, due to the students' young age, we chose 5-point Likert scales. This was in spite of the fact that prior research have suggested that more categories on a scaleare associated with higher reliability, and that 7-point scales may be superior in terms of reliability (Foldnes & Grgnneberg, 2022; Preston & Colman, 2000).

An open question is also whether the students' reporting of motivational levels was influenced by the sequence within the scales. In the present study l tasks were presented from the left ranging from 5 to 1: poitive towards more negative faces and biger towards smaller circles. To avoid this potential anchoring effect, L. Hall et al. (2016) suggest to flip the sequence of the scale for $5 0 \%$ of the given sample (e.g. from negative towards positive, ranging from 1 to 5). Future investigations should consider including this flipped design when comparing the quality of different scales.

Given that our current flipped design only includes two constellations (i.., face-circe and circl-face), another limitation of the present study regards the impossbility of separately modeling intr-individual changes that are due to factors other than the change of format between the two waves, as this type of variance i confounded with the format change in our current design. To extract intra individual variance from the format-based change, we would need to include two additional constelltions in our tes design, namely face-face, and circle-circle. However, any ystematic patten in inr-individual changes wllat least be cancelled in our current model, given the random assignment of face-circle vs circl-face in our fliped design. In addition, to account for random pattern in intraindividual change, we included a random slope associated with wave.

Finall, given the widespread use of different types of pictorial support in writing research and other fields, we argue that more attention and further testing of different types of pictorial supports is needed in the development of valid scales for young students.

# 6. Concluding remarks

The take home message from the preent investgation is that it i not indifferent what kind of pictorial support i used in measures of elementary students motivation for writing. As remarked by Kahneman et a. (2021, p. 199), \*the choice of ascale can make a large difference in the amount of noise in judgments, because ambiguous scales are noisy," thus choosing appropriate scales require deliberate considerations. With regard to measures of writing and spelling interest and self-beliefs, findings from the present study suggest that in comparison to face-scales, circle-scales seem to be a more appropriate choice for measuring these constructs among young students. More specifically the circle-scales seemed to be the least noisy for these students. In sum, the results from the current study underpin the recommendations of Bandura (2006) to avoid face-scales in measures of self-efficacy, and further extends these recommendations to measures of writing interest and self-concept.
