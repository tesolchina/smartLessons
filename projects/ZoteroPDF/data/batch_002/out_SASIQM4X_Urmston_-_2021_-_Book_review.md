The publication of Assessing Academic Literacy in a Multilingual Society: Transition and Transformation is likely to attract a lot of interest from those working within the field of EAP assessment, both in South Africa, which is the context for this edited volume, and beyond, to societies where multilingualism is the reality. The book is part of the New Perspectives on Language and Education series under the general editorship of Phan Le Ha and Joel Windle. The series aims to feature ‘critical and interpretive, disciplinary and multidisciplinary perspectives on teaching and learning, language and literacy in new times’ with a focus on ‘the Global South’ and ‘marginalised communities within the Global North’. Though as the editors admit, the nature of South Africa as a former ‘British settler society in which English was dominant as an official language’, means that the work will be of most interest to practitioners in Australia and New Zealand as well as in South Africa (and its neighbouring regions) itself.

Having said this, Assessing Academic Literacy in a Multilingual Society provides a multi-perspective analysis of what we mean by academic literacy and how we go about assessing it, through the different stages of schooling. The chapters are essentially individual papers which had their origins in colloquia presented at international conferences in 2017 and 2018. The featured authors represent a who’s who of researchers into the related fields of academic literacy, language assessment, curriculum design and pedagogy in the South African context. This volume provides insights into areas of academic literacy and its assessment that will be of interest to all those involved in its practice.

The book begins with an introduction by John Read and Collen du Plessis in which they describe the organisation of the chapters to follow and put the South African context into an international one. The volume is then organised into three parts: Conceptual Foundations; Assessing Academic Literacy at Secondary School Level; and Assessing Discipline-Specific Needs at University. As such the chapters follow a logical order. The first section consists of four chapters covering how academic literacy may be conceptualised and how it may be assessed, while the second and third parts, each containing three chapters, look at issues specific to academic literacy assessment in the secondary and tertiary sectors. A postscript, written by Tobie van Dyk, provides an overview of language assessment research in South Africa.

Though there are numerous areas touched upon in the volume, the primary one, and the one to which all others are related, is the ways in which students at the point of entering university are screened and their academic language needs diagnosed so that provision for language and literacy support can be planned and implemented. That the language of instruction in universities in South Africa is mainly English (though Afrikaans and other indigenous languages are also used) and the students entering come from diverse and often inadequate educational backgrounds provides a great platform for investigation that many readers can relate to.

What perhaps is one of the most valuable aspects of this volume is the discussions on different perspectives of what academic literacy means. It seems not to be a concept that is easily definable as it is very context driven. That the context here is the South African one, with its unique characteristics of multilingualism in a post-colonial world is relatable to many language teachers and testers. The authors throughout the volume, by necessity, keep returning to their interpretations of academic literacy and this helps the reader to formulate a greater understanding of what it means and from there, how we approach its assessment and subsequent follow-up interventions. So we have discussions of academic literacy in relation to policy, both language policy and language assessment policy, at both secondary and tertiary levels. That is not to say that the volume focuses only on theoretical and administrative considerations, as there is plenty to interest the researcher and the practitioner.

Most of the authors draw on the work in academic literacy of Weideman (for example Weideman, 2003 & 2007 and his chapter in this volume) and he is clearly one of the leading figures in the field, having published widely on it and being the lead editor (one assumes) of this book. In his own chapter, Weideman looks at the assessment of academic literacy from a skills-neutral perspective or, taking into consideration Bachman and Palmer’s (1996) view of the importance of looking at language proficiency in terms of target language use (TLU) domains, a functional view of language ability in terms of the use of academic language for interaction in academic settings. This is a theme or position taken up by many of the authors in the book, especially those in Part 3, where the theme is Assessing Discipline-Specific Needs at University.

The focus of the volume of course is assessing academic literacy and the different chapters, essentially individual research papers, look at this from varying perspectives and in various ways. The initial chapters in Part 1 set the context and Theo de Plessis’ opening chapter is highly informative for those not familiar with language policy at universities in South Africa, where there is an increasing emphasis on recognising the country’s 11 official indigenous languages, though the language of instruction, and therefore the focus of assessments, is invariably English. It is in this section, and throughout the book, that we are introduced to the different academic literacy assessments and examinations that are prevalent in South Africa, such as the Test of Academic Literacy Levels (TALL) and the Test of Advanced Language Ability (TALA). It is important that such tests (and their abbreviations/acronyms) and introduced early so that the reader not familiar already with the testing context becomes so and they are here, with the TALL in particular described in detail in Chapter 3. What would perhaps have been helpful would have been some sample items included as an appendix, though it is noted that there are no appendices in any of the chapters.

The chapters in Part 2 look specifically at the assessment of academic literacy at the pre-university stage and as such are highly critical of the present situation in South Africa. These chapters are thorough in their analysis of the different policies and assessments employed and raise numerous questions that not only practitioners in South Africa will be interested in but those who have to deal with such issues in similar contexts will also. The approach here is one of looking at current assessments, such as the TALA, critiquing it, and then offering alternatives through the reporting of analysis of these assessments in operation. This is highly accessible for readers who are either teachers, administrators or researchers, or any combination of these.

In the opening chapter of Part 3, Kabelo Sebolai provides a logical progression from the previous chapters with a general look at the assessment of academic literacy at university level, setting the scene for the two chapters that follow which are more discipline specific, and serve as case studies for how post-entry academic literacy assessments and interventions can be realised. What is most encouraging is the reported potential for the use of the assessments for diagnostic purposes and not simply as gate-keeping mechanisms. Lastly, in the postscript to the volume, Tobie van Dyk provides an excellently detailed and informative review of research into language assessment in South Africa’s multilingual context.

Assessing Academic Literacy in a Multilingual Society is an excellent collection of contemporary research studies into the assessment of academic language literacy in South Africa. Each chapter represents a separate study and has been written up as such. The studies vary from reviews and commentaries to reports on original research, both qualitative and quantitative. In the main, the research studies are presented in very clear and accessible terms, with an avoidance of excessive technicality, thereby making the book a useful and informative resource for language teachers, administrators and researchers. In some chapters there is scope for more information to be given, such as examples of assessment tasks, questionnaire items and so on, though it seems that the editors decided not to include appendices so as to make the volume more compact.

It should be stressed that though each chapter stands alone as an individual study, there is a pleasing coherence to the chapters and how they have been assembled that reflects well on the editors.

The analyses of academic language use and its assessment in the multilingual society that is South Africa are very well presented in this book and it will be of great interest to those within this particular context and to others with similar educational and demographic structures. This to a certain extent may limit the potential readership to those within similar contexts, though consideration could have been given to the inclusion of a chapter that looks beyond the South African to the wider world and makes connections that practitioners in other contexts can relate to.

Despite slight concerns about potential limitations in its appeal, given its focus specifically on the South African context, Assessing Academic Literacy in a Multilingual Society is very well compiled and the individual chapters so well written that the book is still a valuable addition to the literature on the assessment of academic literacy. Its extensive and thought-provoking coverage of the issues faced by education systems, institutions and individual within them will serve as a valuable resource as they plan the road ahead in this rapidly changing field. The collection will also be a useful model for novice researchers in how to present relatively complex research in a reader-friendly way.
