# 3 Culture and Peer Feedback Guangwei Hu

Peer feedback, as a learning activity and a source of information in the writing classroom, has received a fair bit of research attention in the last four decades. This reflects both the increased recognition of the potential of feedback to direct and facilitate learning in general and writing development in particular (Hyland & Hyland, 2006a; Hattie & Timperly, 2007; Hu & Choo, 2016) and the affinity of feedback to several influential approaches to writing instruction such as process-based, interactionist, genre-oriented, and sociocultural approaches (Hu, 2005; Hyland & Hyland, 2006b). Also referred to as peer response, peer review, peer revision, peer editing, peer tutoring, peer critiquing and writing group, peer feedback as a pedagogical activity was first advocated and researched in the first language (L1) writing classroom (Gere, 1987; DiPardo & Freedman, 1988). Because of its various perceived benefits, it was then introduced into second language (L2) writing instruction and generated a substantial body of research on its various aspects. Most of this literature has been reviewed in Hyland and Hyland (2006b) and, more recently, Yu and Lee (2016), both of which are state-of-the-art reviews published in Language Teaching.

In this chapter, I present an overview of previous research examining cultural influences on peer feedback before I zoom in on the major criticisms levelled at the concept of culture adopted in this line of inquiry. I argue that despite those criticisms, culture is a useful construct in our efforts to understand L2 writing and peer feedback. Cognizant of the various problems with the traditional, received view of culture, I propose to reconceptualise the concept and borrow the conceptual tool of ‘scale’, a spatiotemporal frame by means of which complex and polycentric sociocultural phenomena are organised hierarchically (Blommaert, 2010), to redefine culture as a scalar construct. I then apply this scalar conception of culture to demonstrate how cultures in different scales can account for both the similarities and differences in perceptions and practices of peer feedback observed in three empirical studies of Chinese EFL/ESL learners. By way of conclusion, I propose to adopt nexus analysis (Scollon $\&$ Scollon, 2004) as an analytic approach to exploit the affordances of scalar culture for understanding sociocultural connections across scales, the dialectical relationship between culture and individuality, and the centrality of culture to peer feedback in the L2 writing classroom.

# Research on Peer Feedback from Cultural Perspectives

Earlier research conducted from a cultural perspective gave attention to how cultural backgrounds of L2 students might influence their attitudes toward and participation in peer feedback. For example, Allaei and Connor (1990) observed that because peer feedback as a pedagogical activity depended heavily on a particular type of politeness strategy, asking L2 students with different cultural backgrounds to participate in a collaborative activity such as peer feedback would be tantamount to ‘asking them to adopt communicative styles that they may be unfamiliar and uncomfortable with’, giving rise to the possibility of ‘conflict, or at the very least, high levels of discomfort’ (p. 22). In a study of ESL students from Asian countries at a New Zealand university, Hyland (2000) also found that many of these students felt ‘uncomfortable with the peer response situation’ (p. 52) because it was not their cultural practice to criticise a peer’s work and, consequently, completed written peer-feedback tasks perfunctorily. Tsui and $\mathrm { N g }$ (2000) investigated the use of peer feedback in a secondary English class in Hong Kong and reported that all the participating students favoured teacher feedback more than peer feedback and incorporated more teacher comments into their revisions, patterns consistent with the traditional Chinese conception of teachers as sources of authority.

Yang, Badger, and Yu (2006), however, found that their university students in China (a country reputedly characterised by a large power distance) valued peer feedback and incorporated most of usable feedback points in their revisions. The researchers interpreted these results as arguing against the universal generalisability of Nelson and Carson’s (1998) finding about the difficulty that students from cultures of a large power distance had with peer feedback. Similarly, Hu and Lam (2010) showed that students from China studying at a Singaporean university accepted peer feedback as a socioculturally appropriate learning activity and were able to provide many valid suggestions on peers’ writing and respond positively to peer comments. In a more recent study of Swedish university students collaborating with their American counterparts on an online technical writing platform, Bradley (2014) found that the Swedish participants were aware of differences in cultural aspects of peer review, approached those differences as resources, and developed their intercultural sensitivity through giving and responding to peer feedback on each other’s writing assignments.

Studies have also examined culturally shaped expectations about roles of group members and interaction strategies within groups. In their research on ESL writing groups at an American university (Nelson $\&$ Carson, 1995, 1998; Carson & Nelson, 1996), Carson and Nelson found that although the Chinese participants in their studies perceived the goal of peer feedback as criticising each other’s drafts, they were mainly concerned with the social dimensions of peer feedback and exhibited behaviours different from those desired in writing groups, for example, saying what may please peers rather than what might help them improve their writing, feeling reluctant to initiate comments, especially critical ones, remaining silent about perceived problems in peers’ drafts, seeking consensus rather than expressing disagreement, and softening criticism in various ways. Carson and Nelson interpreted these behaviours as reflecting collectivist values and practices said to characterise Chinese culture, such as the importance of maintaining interpersonal harmony and attending to group members’ face needs. Jones, Garralda, and Lock’s (2006) study of Chinese student tutors and tutees in a ‘Language Clinic’ at a Hong Kong university revealed the dominant use of hierarchical face systems in face-to-face tutoring meetings, which were seen as conforming to ‘cultural norms of teacher-student interaction in Chinese educational contexts’ (p. 17).

More recent research, however, has pointed to the multifaceted and accommodative nature of cultural traditions and values. Tsui and $\mathrm { N g }$ (2010), for example, showed how two experienced secondary-school teachers of English in Hong Kong drew on their profound understanding of Chinese cultural practices and values concerning self–group relationship, group harmony, teacher authority, and face to skilfully and sensitively create a rich array of possibilities for learning in their peer-feedback activities, which their students both actively engaged in and benefitted greatly from. Yu, Lee, and Mak (2016) also demonstrated that although the Chinese university students in their study valued interpersonal harmony, they did not refrain from giving critical but constructive peer feedback because they did not perceive maintaining such harmony to be in conflict with expressing disagreement. Furthermore, while there was power distance due to the students’ varying English proficiency, role assignment (i.e., group leader vs. members), and division of labour, it did not constrain their group discussions or prevent them from working collaboratively to improve each other’s L2 writing.

Some studies have taken a close look at the content of peer feedback provided by L2 students from different cultural backgrounds. The aforementioned studies by Carson and Nelson found that Chinese students’ peer feedback consisted of indirect and underspecified comments that were aimed to soften criticisms and conceal disagreements so as to avoid embarrassing peers and making them lose face. Hyland (2000) also found that, because of face considerations, her Asian L2 students gave vague and cursory feedback that did not help revision. Somewhat similarly, Guardado and Shi’s (2007) study of exchange students from Japan, another collectivist culture, revealed that although they were able to balance positive and negative comments on local and global issues in their peer feedback, these comments did not necessarily lead to revisions due to a culturally shaped lack of confidence in peers’ authority as a useful source of feedback.

By contrast, Hu and Lam (2010) found that their Chinese ESL students were able to provide valid suggestions on the language, content, and textual organisation of their peers’ writing that did lead to effective revisions. The Chinese students in Yu et al. (2016) also gave both positive and negative feedback on grammar, vocabulary, content, organisation, and fluency of their peers’ essays which was perceived to help improve the quality of their peers’ drafts. Similarly, the three university students in Yu and Hu (2017a) received a variety of useful and specific comments on different aspects of their writing, and their revisions based on the comments improved their textual quality.

Finally, several studies have approached the pragmatics of peer comments from a cultural perspective. In a study of the email correspondence between an American and two German university students in an unsuccessful telecollaborative project, Belz (2003) conducted a close linguistic analysis of their responses to each other’s writing and found that the two German students made frequent use of unhedged negative appraisal, categorical assertions, and face-threatening intensifiers in contrast to their American counterpart’s practice of prefacing his hedged critique with praise, mitigating face-threatening pragmatic acts, and tempering suggestions for improvement. Belz attributed the observed differences to ‘culturally-contingent conversational styles’ (p. 82) characterised by ‘directness, explicitness, and an orientation toward the self’ in German and ‘indirectness and implicitness’ in English (p. 91). Similar differences were found in Ruecker’s (2011) study of two peer feedback groups comprising Chilean and American students at a Chilean university, with the Chilean students being more critical and less likely to mitigate their criticism than their American group members. Ruecker suggested that Chileans’ cultural tendency to be direct with criticism ‘can cause tension in a peer review project’ (p. 404). By contrast, Bradley (2014) found that in their peer feedback on American students’ writing, Swedish students were capable of ‘toning down the directness in commenting that they were used to from the Swedish educational context’ (p. 89) as a result of careful pedagogical preparation. In a study of Vietnamese adult EFL students’ expression of criticisms in peer feedback, Nguyen (2008) reported that they used significantly fewer external and internal modifiers to mitigate their criticisms of peers’ essays, compared with native English-speaking students completing a similar task at an Australian university. These EFL students, however, resembled a Vietnamese control group completing the task in their L1 in terms of the frequency and type of modifiers used. Nguyen related her findings to the linguistic features of the students’ L1, the culturally preferred pragmatics of Vietnamese, and the ‘collective orientation’ of Vietnamese culture that values ‘involvement’ and ‘sincerity’ more than personal space (p. 785).

Three comments can be made about the studies of cultural influences reviewed above. First, this body of research has produced a mixed bag of findings. Findings from the later studies have not only complemented and nuanced, but more often than not complicated, contradicted or problematised, the findings of the earlier research. Second, cultural studies of peer feedback in L2 writing have been on the decline. The diminishing research interest is evidenced in Yu and Lee’s (2016) latest comprehensive review of research on peer feedback, which included only eight empirical studies of cultural issues in peer feedback published in the preceding decade. Third, this dwindling attention to cultural influences on peer feedback can be attributed in part to the withering criticism of culture as a theoretical construct. With few exceptions, the conceptions of culture adopted in previous studies, especially the earlier ones, have been criticised by both researchers who continue to use culture as a lens through which to examine L2 learning (e.g., Tsui $\&$ Ng, 2010; Holliday, 2013) and those who reject the very concept of culture at all (e.g., Spack, 1997; Kubota, 1999). The vocal critical charges against culture have gathered such momentum and traction that ‘cultural influence on L2 writing often seems to have become a topic either to critique or avoid’ (Atkinson, 2016, p. 546).

# Culture under Fire

The conceptions of culture underpinning previous peer-feedback research mostly reflect what Atkinson (1999) has called a ‘received’ view of cultures as ‘geographically (and quite often nationally) distinct entities, as relatively unchanging and homogeneous, and as allencompassing systems of rules or norms that substantially determine personal behavior’ (p. 626). In step with intense critiques of culture as a theoretical construct in the social sciences and cultural studies, this view has been criticised by postmodernist L2 writing scholars for being ‘deterministic, essentializing, stereotyping, dichotomising, and Othering’ (Li, 2014, p. 107). For example, studies of cultural influences on L2 writing are said to have ‘led to a determinism, resulting in treating these subjects as conditioned by the features of their purported cultures to communicate in predictable ways’ (Canagarajah, 2013, p. 205). In a similar vein, Spack (1997) asserted that ‘teachers and researchers need to view students as individuals, not as members of a cultural group’ (p. 772).

Much L2 writing research adopting culture as an explanatory construct has also been dismissed for holding a simplistic and essentialising assumption that learners in the same ethnic/national category are similar to each other but differ fundamentally from learners in other ethnic/national groups. According to Zamel (1997), such a construal of cultures as ‘discrete, discontinuous, and predictable’ (p. 343) leads to ‘reductive and oversimplified’ (p. 349) characterisations, misreadings and distortions. Cultural studies of L2 writing have further been censured for ‘perpetuating cultural myths’ (Spack, 1997, p. 768), developing stereotypes, and colluding in the promotion of various cultural deficit views (Spack, 1997). These studies are seen as contributing to a colonialist discourse that engages in Othering through producing dichotomous, ethnocentric cultural descriptions (Kubota $\&$ Lehner, 2004).

Critics of culturally orientated research also suggest that the appeal to culture as an explicans offers researchers an easy way out by creating neat, idealised models and ignoring ‘the complexity, unpredictability, and multiplicity inherent in our students’ attempts to make sense through their languages’ (Zamel, 1997, p. 349). To these critics, this interpretative approach can easily slip into ‘rhetorical construction’ (Spack, 1997, p. 769) and give false reassurance about control over what is complicated and perplexing. Such searing criticisms have characterised culture as an outdated, misleading construct and undermined its validity as a lens for understanding L2 writing development. As a result, Atkinson (2016) points out, ‘little work has appeared in recent years which explicitly attempts to develop the culture concept in L2 writing’ (p. 559). The postmodernist dismissal of the construct of culture, however, is not warranted (Atkinson $\&$ Sohn, 2013; Li, 2014). As argued in the following section, culture is an essential construct for understanding L2 writing in general and peer feedback in particular.

# Culture as a Useful Construct and Its Reconceptualisation

Cultural psychologists Markus and Kitayama (2010) point out that ‘cultures and selves define and build upon each other in an ongoing cycle of mutual constitution’ (p. 420) and that ‘cultural variation across selves arises from differences in the images, ideas (including beliefs, values, and stereotypes), norms, tasks, practices, and social interactions that characterize various social environments and reflects differences in how to attune to these environments’ (p. 421). Because of this interconnectedness of culture and self, culture features prominently in influential theories of human development and learning. For example, Bronfenbrenner’s (1979) bioecological theory of human development views culture as part (i.e., the macrosystems) of the ecology for human development, which involves ‘the progressive, mutual accommodation between an active, growing human being and the changing properties of the immediate settings in which the developing person lives’ (1979, p. 21). Vygotsky’s (1978) sociocultural theory sees an even greater role of culture in individual development. From a sociocultural perspective, human activity and development are always embedded culturally, historically and institutionally; individuals’ developmental changes are rooted in culture and society; consequently, human learning can only be understood in relation to the sociocultural context where it takes place (Villamil & Guerrero, 2006).

In a similar vein, Weisner’s (2009) encultural theory views learning environments as being configured with culturally shaped ideas, practices and institutions, and emphasises the cultural socialisation of mind and heart through daily routines: ‘the cultural learning environment provides the proximal settings we participate in as we move through daily routines’ (p. 191). In her theory of development as transformation of participation, Rogoff (2003) also argues that ‘human development is a cultural process’ (p. 3) and relates individuals’ development of ways of thinking, reasoning, remembering and problem-solving to daily cultural practices, that is, ‘configurations of routine ways of doing things in any community’s approach to living’ (p. 3).

Although these theories define culture and its relationship to individuals differently, the way forward does not lie in discarding culture as a lens for understanding shared patterns of thinking, feeling, believing and acting that are negotiated contextually and instantiated agentively by individuals. Rather, it is more productive to reconceptualise culture so that the redefined construct can address the various postmodernist criticisms of the received view of culture in research on L2 writing in general and peer feedback in particular. The challenge resides in coming up with new ways of talking about culture that view a cultural group as being ‘in motion, permeable and permeating, unbounded and unstable, fragmented, heterogeneous, incoherent, and changing’ (Nelson & Carson, 2006, p. 52).

To this end, the notion of ‘scale’, a time–space metaphor borrowed from social theory, provides the conceptual apparatus for reconceptualising the construct of culture. As used in history, social geography and sociolinguistics, scale is a spatiotemporal frame for organising complex and polycentric sociocultural phenomena hierarchically and draws our attention to the fact that ‘social events and processes move and develop on a continuum of layered scales, with the strictly local (micro) and the global (macro) as extremes, and with several intermediary scales. . .in between’ (Blommaert, 2010, p. 32). Interactions between the scale levels are key to understanding these social events and processes. A social phenomenon operating at lower scale levels is embodied by momentary, local, individual, specific and diverse processes, whereas the same phenomenon experienced at higher scale levels is reflected in what appear to be timeless, translocal, collective, general and uniform processes (Blommaert, 2010, p. 35). The conceptual application of scale to culture turns the latter into a scalar construct; that is, culture can simultaneously operate on different levels.

On the higher scale levels are macrocultures, namely shared ideologies and practices among members of large (e.g., ethnic, national and international) groupings. These commonalities result both from the structural (e.g., social, economic and material) affordances and constraints of a cultural environment that favour certain cultural orientations (Weisner, 2009; Markus & Kitayama, 2010) and from socialisation through various institutions, with education being a primary socialising institution (Nelson & Carson, 2006). Thus, students from a particular macroculture have come to share ‘attitudes, beliefs and values about how to learn and about what constitutes a good standard of academic work, about expectations of what should happen in classrooms regarding roles, relationships, interaction and activities . . . learned through early socialisation and previous schooling’ (Jin $\&$ Cortazzi, 2017, p. 241). It is important to emphasise that macrocultures guide rather than determine their members’ beliefs and practices, as demonstrated in Tsui and Ng’s (2010) study of peer feedback in the Hong Kong context.

There is considerable patterned variation within a macrocultural context; part of such variation is reflected in mesocultures, that is, those variations in ideologies and practices that distinguish a local community from another one that shares the same macroculture (Weisner, 2009). Such a community can be a municipality, a corporation or a university. Mesocultures, operating at an intermediate level of social organisation, are constituted by experiences, beliefs, and practices made possible and necessary by local historical, social, and material contexts. Like a macroculture, a mesoculture provides individuals with basic guidelines or cultural schemata for practices, but does not determine their behaviour.

Finally, at the lowest scale levels are microcultures, which comprise patterned beliefs and practices resulting from individuals’ interactions with and appropriations of cultural materials at hand in an immediate social environment such as an L2 writing class. Microcultures arise from a process described by Holliday (2013) as ‘small culture formation on the run’ – ‘every day, everywhere, whoever we meet or even think about, we are always in the process of constructing and dealing with cultural realities’ (p. 3). Seen in this light, microcultures are meaning-making processes through which individuals selectively interpret, instantiate, or reject the shared ideologies that are available to them as members of groups’ (Mistry et al., 2016, p. 1015). Thus, the notion of microculture underscores ‘the cultural nature of everyday life’ (Rogoff, 2003, p. 10) and the mutual defining of individuals and cultural practices.

The conceptualisation of culture as a scalar construct redefines culture as both ‘generalizable ideologies and practices shared by groups and the meaning-making processes through which individuals interpret their environmental contexts by drawing upon the shared ideologies available to them as members of groups’ (Mistry et al., 2016, p. 1016). It avoids the problems of essentialism, stereotyping, dichotomisation, reification and Othering for which the traditional received view of culture in peer-feedback research has been criticised. There are dialectic relationships between cultures operating at different scales. While cultures at higher scale levels afford cultural orientations and materials to work with at lower scale levels, cultures in lower scales are situated transformations of the former and introduce diversity and variation into the former because even individuals ‘inhabiting similar configurations of cultural contexts or similar social spaces will obviously diverge in the specifics of their everyday experiences and will differentially attend to features of these experiences’ (Markus $\&$ Kitayama, 2010, p. 423). Thus, cultural practices are ‘constantly reconstrued and reconstructed in the agentive activities of human beings, although not in a wholly unconstrained way’ (Atkinson, 1999, p. 649), and individuals become ‘socioculturally shaped shapers of their environments’ (Markus & Kitayama, 2010, p. 421). Cultures in different scales interact with each other dynamically and exist coconstitutively. As demonstrated in the following section, the construct of scalar culture can shed light on and reconcile the mixed findings from the studies of cultural influences on peer feedback reviewed in the preceding section.

# Understanding L2 Peer Feedback through the Lens of Scalar Culture

To illustrate its conceptual affordances, the findings of three previous studies on peer feedback involving Chinese students are reexamined from the perspective of scalar culture. While cultures at different scales are simultaneously involved in a peer-feedback activity, culture on a particular scale level is foregrounded for the sake of illustration.

# Macrocultural Influences on Peer Feedback

Hu and Ren (2012) examined how Chinese EFL students’ previous learning experience and beliefs related to their feedback preferences. The study drew on data collected from a written survey of 116 junior English language majors at a major university in China. At the time of data collection, these students were taking an advanced English writing course, in which they were asked to review peers’ drafts and revise their own according to peer feedback. Except for a brief explanation by the writing instructor about what they could do in peer feedback, they had not received other forms of training on giving and using peer feedback. Among the results of the study, several are relevant to our focus here. First, over seventy-eight percent of the students perceived previously received teacher feedback as ‘very useful’ or ‘useful’, whereas fifty-three percent said the same about peer feedback. Second, while thirty-eight percent of the students preferred to have teacher feedback only and sixty-percent accepted both teacher and peer feedback, none indicated a preference for peer feedback only. Third, despite their negative perceptions of previously received teacher feedback (as only ‘somewhat useful’), seven students (i.e., thirty percent of those with negative perceptions) still preferred teacher feedback only. In fact, a statistical test failed to find a statistically significant relationship between feedback preference and previous experience with teacher feedback (i.e., whether such feedback was reported to be useful). Finally, despite their reported positive experience with peer feedback, seventeen students (i.e., over twenty-seven percent of those reporting positive experience) still preferred to have only teacher feedback. Taken together, these results indicated an overwhelming and apparently groundless preference for teacher feedback over peer feedback.

The strong preference for teacher feedback observed in this study was consistent with the findings of several other studies of Chinese ESL/EFL students conducted in different educational contexts (e.g., Nelson $\&$ Carson, 1998; Hyland, 2000; Tsui $\& N g , 2 0 0 0 , 2 0 1 { \bar { 0 } } ;$ Yang et al., 2006; Hu & Lam, 2010). It seems to be rooted in the time-honoured culture of learning that Chinese students are socialised into in greater China, where schooling has been characterised by a teacher-centred, examination-orientated approach (Zhao, 2014). In such a culture of learning, teachers are viewed as authority figures having profound knowledge, wisdom and insight (Hyland & Hyland, 2006a; Nelson & Carson, 2006) and capable of answering all student questions (Jin & Cortazzi, 2017). These cultural expectations were clearly manifest in the characterisations of teacher feedback given by the Chinese students in Hu and Ren (2012) to support their expressed preference for teacher feedback: teachers and teacher feedback were overwhelmingly described with words such as ‘authoritative’, ‘valid’, ‘trusted’, ‘expertise’, ‘knowledgeable’, ‘experienced’, ‘effective’ and so on.

As Markus and Kitayama (2010) argue, ‘cultural beliefs and values – especially those that are important and, thus, have constituted each culture’s practices, institutions, and its ways of life – are, by definition, inscribed into these practices, institutions, and ways of life’ (p. 426). It is important to note that relating feedback preferences to macrocultural frames does not endorse a deficit view of cultures. As Rogoff (2003) points out, there is a need to separate understanding of cultural patterns of practice from judgements of their value. It is also necessary to keep in mind a major limitation of examining cultural practices only from a macrocultural perspective – neglect of cultural variation. What follows is a revisit of a study conducted at another Chinese university that revealed such variation related to peer feedback.

# Mesocultural Mediation of Peer Feedback

Yu and Hu (2017b) report a case study of factors influencing two Chinese EFL university students’ beliefs and practices concerning peer feedback. The two students, Alan and Leo, were first-semester freshmen who worked with two other male classmates in a self-selected peer feedback group in an English writing class. A combination of semistructured interviews, video recordings of peer-feedback sessions, stimulated recalls, and drafts of essays revealed patterned differences in their feedback practices and beliefs. Alan focused almost exclusively on language form when he responded to his group members’ drafts, and his comments were mostly negative, directive and couched in authoritative grammatical rules and metalingual terms. By contrast, Leo gave more balanced attention to form, content and other aspects of writing in his peer feedback. Alan and Leo also had different conceptions of what constituted good writing. For Alan, grammatical errors were major problems that were ‘most intolerable’ and should be ‘shot on sight’. Leo, on the other hand, believed that well-written essays should contain interesting and well-developed ideas organised in a logical fashion. Alan’s primary motive for peer feedback was to help his partners produce an error-free essay so that they could get higher scores from their writing teacher. In contrast, Leo was driven by the motives to improve the fluency of his partners’ writing and to learn new vocabulary and ideas from his peers’ texts. The two students also had different understandings of group dynamics and face needs. While Alan took friendly interpersonal relationships for granted and did not perceive bluntly expressed criticisms to be face-threatening, Leo did take his peers’ face needs into consideration and acted accordingly in the interest of group harmony.

As is apparent from the above summary, though the two students differed in multiple respects, each one’s own beliefs, motives, understandings and practices did cohere. Such patterned variation could not be explained by macrocultural influences because they shared the same macroculture. Rather, it could be attributed to the distinctive mesocultures the students had found themselves in and their unique learning histories embedded in their local sociocultural environments.

Alan had completed his preuniversity education in a small town in Shandong, whereas Leo had grown up in Beijing, the social, cultural and political heart of China. When reflecting on influences on his feedback beliefs and practices, Alan acknowledged that he ‘imitated’ his secondary-school teachers who ‘seldom commented on the content and organization’ and ‘told us that the scorers didn’t look at the content in our essays written for exams’. Similarly, Leo also modelled his feedback practices on those of his secondary Chinese and English language teachers: ‘My Chinese writing teachers emphasised idea development in writing’ and ‘said a lot about how to develop an argument, how to discuss one thing from several angles, and how to support our ideas with examples’. Furthermore, English had meant different things for them. As Alan confided: ‘I came from a small town where English is seldom used. I never saw any foreigner in my hometown and didn’t have any chance to speak English . . . English was not useful at all in my life’. For him, learning English was for passing examinations and gaining admission into a university. By contrast, English had sociocultural relevance to Leo beside its educational utility. Thus, he was able to learn English through watching movies, reading magazines and newspapers and listening to English songs in his secondary-school years. Notably, the differing English learning resources available to Alan and Leo shaped their learning approaches, too. These and other sociocultural and educational differences between the local communities where Alan and Leo had resided were inscribed in their ‘historical body’ (Scollon & Scollon, 2004, p. 13) and mediated the ways they subsequently interacted with their new cultural learning environments and engaged with peer feedback.

# Microculture and Peer Feedback

Hu (2005) reports a three-year action research effort to implement peer feedback with groups of first-year university students from China who were taking an academic writing class in a six-month intensive English programme run at a Singaporean university to prepare them for an English-medium undergraduate education in Singapore. In view of the various problems that Chinese students were reported to have with peer feedback in previous research, an expansive and carefully coordinated array of pedagogical strategies and actions was adopted to create a microcultural environment that would enable the students to engage with peer feedback as a culturally appropriate and legitimate pedagogical activity. For example, small-group discussions of the potential benefits and problems of peer feedback and possible solutions to these problems, teacher sharing of research findings about peer feedback, and examples of academic writers benefitting from peer feedback were orchestrated to raise the students’ awareness of peer feedback as a productive learning activity and the pitfalls to avoid when engaging in the activity.

Procedural guidance about the place of peer feedback in a writing cycle, a three-step response sequence to follow, and strategies for using a peer-feedback sheet of guiding questions provided the necessary scaffolding of students’ initial undertaking of the activity. Guided whole-class discussions of peer comments on a draft in progress, revisions made in response to the comments in a second draft, and a ‘live’ teacher demonstration of responding to a draft via thinkingaloud helped to foster students’ understanding of what productive and unproductive peer feedback were like. Guided whole-class practice in responding to and revising drafts written by students from the previous year, teacher-led discussions on appropriate reader stances to take and useful types of feedback to make, and explicit instruction in desirable feedback behaviour and appropriate language to use in peer comments developed students’ skills for and abilities to engage in productive peer feedback. Teacher follow-ups in the form of responding to written peer comments, highlighting useful and problematic peer comments, and providing feedback on peer feedback provided continual support to students’ changing participation in peer feedback as a sociocultural activity.

The study illustrates how a microculture can be instituted and reinforced by deliberate and expansive everyday practices to guide Chinese students’ engagement with peer feedback, a pedagogical activity said to ‘be antithetical to the values of many Chinese’ (Nelson $\&$ Carson, 2006, p. 47). The cultural tools, meaning-making strategies, moment-by-moment learning opportunities and guided participation made available to the students structured their engagement with peer feedback on a routine basis and facilitated their involvement in and creation of new cultural practices (Rogoff, 2003). The carefully guided cultural processes made the students become ‘aware of, appreciate and extend their repertoires of practices’ (Jin $\&$ Cortazzi, 2017, p. 238). Thus, the study provides a good example of how new cultural practices can be negotiated, incorporated and engaged in routinely at a microcultural level.

# Conclusion

This chapter reviews previous research that examined cultural issues in feedback and the recent criticisms of the views of culture manifested in this research. In opposition to the postmodernist call to abandon the concept, the chapter argues that culture is an indispensable construct for understanding beliefs and practices centred on peer feedback in L2 writing. As Hyland and Hyland (2006a) point out, ‘although teachers and students are not prisoners of their origins or of the communities in which they habitually participate, human cognition and learning is rooted in cultural environments and influenced by the discursive practices of their social groups’ (p. 12). To address the limitations of the ‘received’ view of culture adopted in previous studies, the chapter proposes a reconceptualisation of culture as a scalar phenomenon. Such a redefinition of culture, it is argued, can best capture the situated, dynamic, fluid, complex and negotiated nature of cultural practices and the ways they mediate the enactment of peer feedback in the L2 writing classroom. It allows us to ask the productive questions of what cultural practices our students are familiar with, participate in or transform to understand how culture and individual development mutually constitute each other (Rogoff, 2003).

What pedagogical stances and practices does this reconceptualisation of culture as a scalar construct call for with respect to peer feedback? Clearly, the reconceptualisation does not warrant a stance that treats peer feedback as a cultural minefield to avoid simply because it is culturally complex and may not sit comfortably with students’ cultural–historical learning experience. Rather, it requires the creation of a microcultural milieu where macro- and meso-cultural influences potentially at tension with peer feedback are negotiated proactively and productively. To this end, pedagogical practices must be informed by a cultural sensitivity that recognises macro- and mesocultural influences as well as the agency of students and teachers in their microcultural context. Various awareness-raising activities, such as those used in Hu (2005), can be integrated into classroom work to make students appreciate the benefits of peer feedback as a learning activity and understand how to maximise them.

It is also imperative to equip students with effective strategies for addressing their culturally rooted concerns. As an illustration, teachers can model, and help students develop, communicative and interpersonal strategies that can convey constructive critical feedback without straining group relations if group harmony is culturally valued (Berg, 1999; Hu, 2005). Efforts should also be made to turn culturally shaped preferences that might appear to be at tension with the effective functioning of peer feedback into affordances to create cultural synergy. For example, collectivist practices such as social interdependence and strong group identification, which were considered antithetical to peer feedback, can be harnessed to make peer feedback a group activity that benefits the whole group rather than individuals. To make peer feedback become a microcultural practice, teachers need to provide sustained scaffolding, close monitoring and informative appraisal for continual improvement (Hu, 2005; Zhao, 2014). Finally, it is important to maintain an openness to, rather than a rigid view of, how peer feedback can best be enacted and experimented with in the classroom.

The reconceptualisation of culture calls for a new methodological approach to exploit the affordances of scalar culture for understanding cross-scale sociocultural connections, the mutually constituting relationship between culture and individuals, and the cultural mediation of peer feedback in the L2 writing classroom. In this regard, Scollon and Scollon’s (2004) nexus analysis, ‘an ethnographic methodological strategy’ (p. 9) for undertaking the tasks of engaging, navigating and changing a nexus of practice, offers a useful approach to studying how cultures at different scales simultaneously mediate peer feedback as a social practice. A nexus analysis aimed at exploring the relationship between scalar culture and peer feedback will focus on peer feedback as the ‘nexus of practice’ (i.e., a social action routinely taken at a recognisable site of engagement) and examine how the social actors’ ‘historical body’ (i.e., mental and bodily predispositions rooted in a history of personal experience), the prevailing ‘interaction order’ (i.e., all social arrangements by which the social actors interact with each other and form social relationships), and ‘discourses in place’ (e.g., cultures at different scales together with their mediational resources) interact dynamically to enact the sociocognitive practice of peer feedback culturally. Such a historical, multifaceted and contextualised analysis has the potential to capture the intriguing complexity and meandering trajectories of the inevitable cultural mediation of peer feedback as a learning activity.

To conduct nexus analysis, a variety of qualitative and quantitative research designs can be employed to examine the influences of cultures at different scales and their interaction in the enactment of peer feedback as a cultural practice. As pointed out by Rogoff (2003) and Scollon and Scollon (2003), ethnography is the primary, preferred methodology for and theoretical position on understanding social actions (i.e., microcultural practices), the transformation of participation in such actions, and the complex intersection between cultures at different scales, participants’ life experiences and social arrangements for interaction that mediate transformative participation. Case studies, as exemplified in recent culturally orientated research on peer feedback (e.g., Bradley, 2014; Tsui & Ng, 2010; Yu & Hu, 2017a, 2017b), are well equipped to collect rich data from multiple sources and uncover macro- and meso-cultural influences on (small groups of ) individual learners, contextual factors at work, and the learning process centred on peer feedback in a specific learning context. Another qualitative methodology, narrative inquiry (Polkinghorne, 1988; Webster & Mertova, 2007), is useful in organising and giving meaning to life experience (i.e., the historical body), revealing personal trajectories through sociocultural spaces, and identifying critical or salient influences on the trajectories that are relevant to participation in peer feedback.

Quantitative methodologies also have a complementary role to play in nexus analysis $\mathrm { T u } \&$ Lee, 2016). For example, survey research that allows comparison across sociocultural contexts and educational settings can effectively identify macro- and meso-cultural influences, salient beliefs and typical practices regarding peer feedback. Experimental research can establish the effects of microcultural interventions on learners’ affective, behavioural and cognitive engagement with peer feedback as a culturally meaningful learning activity. Anchored in a new understanding of culture as a scalar construct, a careful orchestration of these methodological choices promises to reveal not only how L2 students’ participation in peer feedback is shaped by cumulative cultural processes but also how their agentive engagement with peer feedback can create new cultural practices.
