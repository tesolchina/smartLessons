# Action research to support teachers' classroom materials development

# ABSTRACT

Language teachers constantly create, adapt and evaluate classroom materials to develop new curricula and meet their learners' needs. It has Iong been argued (e.g. by Stenhouse, L. [1975]. An Introduction to Curriculum Research and Development. London: Heinemann) that teachers themselves, as opposed to managers or course book writers, are best placed to develop context-specific materials that effectively and affectively engage learners. However, a systematic approach is required for materials development, and one practical option is through action research. Action research enables teachers to investigate learners' reactions to new materials, and work with them to develop engaging context-specific materials. To illustrate how action research can successfully support materials development, this paper reports on a classroom-based project the first author (Emily) conducted at her college in Australia. The project was part of an innovative national programme for the Australian English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELicOs) sector, initiated and facilitated by the second author (Anne) and the ELicOs peak body English Australia. An Assessment for Learning (AfL) theoretical framework was adopted to integrate lesson materials and assessment, based on learner needs. At the college, previous assessment preparation materials had been ad hoc, so Emily explored what materials would best support her learners in preparing for written assessments and feedback. Innovative classroom materials were developed in negotiation with learners, who were actively involved in the process through interviews, focus groups and surveys. Findings included improved AfL classroom materials and new self-study resources, as well as increased learner motivation. The paper concludes with analysis of the implications of using action research for materials development.

# Introduction: materials development by teachers

Although published textbooks constitute the core materials of many English language courses around the world, it is important that classroom teachers are able to adapt published materials for their specific, local contexts (Graves and Garton 2015; Harwood 2010; Tomlinson 2012; Tomlinson and Masuhara 2004). As Tomlinson and Masuhara (2004, 11) have suggested, teachers need to be able to 'reflect upon their own practice and identify principles and systematic procedures for materials adaptation'. Teachers also need to be able to evaluate materials, either from published course books or that they have created themselves, and Tomlinson (2012) suggests that a research-oriented framework (currently lacking from the literature) is needed so that more dependable results can be obtained as 'evidence' to inform future developments. More recently, at the 49th

Annual IATEFL Conference, Graves and Garton (2015) highlighted the need for classroom teachers to be much more involved in materials adaptation than they currently are. They argued that teachers experience frequent mismatches between the course book and other elements such as the local curriculum, teachers' beliefs and learners' needs. However, teachers also need the skill to adapt standard materials to their specific contexts, and, as Graves and Garton suggested, teacher education courses have an important role to play.

Apart from some pre-service or in-service teacher education courses, there are very few resources, and especially empirical studies, available for teachers on systematic procedures of materials development or adaptation (Garton and Graves 2014). One useful resource is Jolly and Bolitho (2011), who recommend a process whereby teachers work closely with their students, providing feedback and suggestions that are then incorporated into the new, adapted materials. Their practical framework guides teachers through a process of six steps that involves identifying and exploring the need for materials development or adaptation, then producing, using and evaluating the materials - as shown in Figure 1. Jolly and Bolitho note that materials development should ideally be focused on a specific group of learners, and also that teachers are best placed to understand their learners' needs. We agree, and would argue that teachers have the potential to develop highly effective classroom materials, provided they have the training and framework to do so.

In a similar vein, Rashidi (2011) proposes a framework for English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) materials development from a critical pedagogy perspective and based around five key factors: programme, teacher, learner, content and pedagogical. Although Rashid's 11 principles for the creation of English Language Teaching (ELT) materials are certainly a practical resource for teachers, the paper does not explain a coherent process for implementing the principles, which are viewed individually. In addition, while acknowledging the usefulness of resources such as Rashidi (2011) and Jolly and Bolitho (2011), as Garton and Graves (2014, 7) note: It is precisely how teachers use materials to serve the purpose of teaching learners, their insights and decision-making, as well as learners' attitudes towards, and use of materials, that is currently missing from the literature'. The illustrations from Garton and Graves' edited collection aim to address this gap. For example, Al Majthoob (2014) describes how a global course book was adapted to meet the local literacy needs of Bahraini students in early grades, and Bosompem (2014) explores teachers' attitudes to materials adaptation in Ghana and finds that teachers actually felt guilty adapting the course book, which they viewed as all-powerful. Another case study to address this gap is Darici and Tomlinson (forthcoming), who report on the use of a text-driven framework within a small-scale classroom research project Darici conducted to improve classroom materials at Fatih schools in Istanbul. The current paper is an additional contribution to this endeavor, illustrating the use of a different materials development framework: action research.

# Action research as a framework for materials development

Being both highly practical and also research-oriented, action research is a framework that is well suited to the process of materials development. The principles underpinning action research have played a role in thinking about education since the early twentieth century, when John Dewey's ideas about a democratic approach to research started to have influence in North America. Hammersley (2004) points out that the concept of 'teacher research' was actually developed by Stenhouse due to his (and many others') belief that the development and implementation of major curriculum projects in schools, that did not involve teachers' input, often had little impact on classroom teaching and learning. Taking up Dewey's ideas from earlier in the century, Stenhouse proposed that in order for curricular to be improved, teachers needed to be involved, not only in the development of the curricular, but also in the evaluation and subsequent improvement of the lesson materials as they are used in the classroom (Hammersley 2004).

Action research can be defined as 'taking a self-reflective, critical and systematic approach to exploring your own teaching contexts' (Burns 2010, 2), and it seeks both to better understand and improve an aspect of teaching and learning. The process involved in action research is frequently conceptualised as a series of cycles with each cycle involving the steps of planning, action, observation and reflection in a dynamic and integrated spiral (Kemmis and McTaggart 1988). One cycle, and the action and reflection that it includes, often leads to other cycles where tasks, lessons, approaches or strategies are more deeply refined. An alternative view is to consider action research 'phases', not necessarily followed in order but which can guide the process in a dynamic way: Burns (1999, 35) suggested that the following 11 phases are often involved: (1) exploring; (2) identifying; (3) planning; (4) collecting data; (5) analysing/reflecting; (6) hypothesising/speculating; (7) intervening; (8) observing; (9) reporting; (10) writing and (11) presenting.

There are very few published studies on the use of action research for language learning materials adaption and evaluation: exceptions include Tomlinson and Masuhara's (2010) edited collection of teacher reports, and a recent study by Banegas, Pavese, Velazquez and Velez (2013). Banegas et al., a group of secondary EFL teachers in Argentina, implemented a collaborative action research (CAR) project of three cycles. Aiming to overcome the mismatch between the existing materials and their teenage students' needs, the four teachers started by developing their own materials, based on the curriculum, and in negotiation with their students. Evaluation of the materials led to the decision to use more authentic sources and to design more demanding activities. In conducting their CAR project, these teachers realised that they had created a 'democratic process for lesson planning and materials development' (2013, 192). They identified themselves as 'reflective-reflexive creators of knowledge from/for our context' (198), showing that using action research for materials develop. ment can be an empowering process.

# Assessment for learning

In the action research project we describe here, an Assessment for Learning (AfL) theoretical framework was adopted to facilitate the integration of lesson materials and assessment, based on learner needs. According to the UK-based Assessment Reform Group's (ARG) main definition, AfL is:

the process of seeking and interpreting evidence for use by learners and their teachers to decide where the learners are in their learning, where they need to go and how best to get there. (Assessment Reform Group 2002, 2)

The ARG and academics such as Black and Wiliam (1998) have encouraged mainstream educationalists, especially in the UK, to focus more on formative assessment and to harness feedback from such assessment tasks to 'feed forward' into classroom learning (Hattie and Timperley 2007). Another aspect of AfL involves the use of transparent assessment rubrics and exemplars to help students understand their language learning goals, and to support them in making progress (Brown 2004). There has been only a small amount of research on AfL in the ELT context to date, Davison and Leung's (2009) summary of issues in English language teacher-based assessment, Lee's (2011) study on EFL writing, and Fyfe and Vell's (2012) action research report being a few examples relevant to the current paper. The findings from such work are, however, already building a strong case for the effectiveness of using AfL principles in English language classroom practice in terms of the impact on learning and learner motivation. Fyfe and Vella concluded, for instance, that explicit analyse of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) writing assessment rubrics in class greatly assisted their students in understanding how to improve their writing, which in turn helped contribute to higher success rates than was usual for writing on that particular EAP course.

Some recent work on AfL has also taken a sociocultural perspective, such as Willis (2011) study that draws on community of practice theory (Lave and Wenger 1991) to explore teacher and learner roles and relationships in a middle school Australian context that supports learner autonomy. An important implication from Willi' study is that learner autonomy may only be achieved once teachers connect with their students by engaging them in their learning and creating supportive relationships. The current research reinforces this principle, and shows how the action research process can be one method of facilitating such teacher-learner connections.

# Method

This paper reports on a classroom-based action research project conducted by Emily at her college in Australia. The project was part of an annual innovative national action research programme that commenced in 2010 and is still continuing, for the English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS) sector in Australia. The Action Research in ELICOS Programme (see Burns and Edwards 2014) was initiated and facilitated by Anne and the peak body, English Australia.' Emily joined the action research project while she was teaching and coordinating Academic English courses at an ELICOS college that ran on a 'rolling intake' system where new students enrolled each week. At the time of the project there were two Academic English classes at Emily's school, one known as Level 1 (students at B1-B2 on the Common European Framework of Reference [CEFR]), and another known as Level 2 (B2-C1 on the CEFR). Both classes were multilingual, with students from many different countries including Brazil, China, Mexico, Mongolia, Saudi Arabia and Thailand, and in total 18 students took part in the action research project with Emily. The students ranged in age from around 20 to late 30s, and many had previously completed a Bachelor's degree in their native countries. As part of the Academic English course, students had to complete one written assignment (an essay or report) every two weeks.

At this ELicOS college, previous assessment preparation had been ad hoc, and a mismatch was identified between the students' needs and the assessment materials. Since new assessment rubrics for essay writing, aligned with the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) writing criteria and the CEFR, had just been designed, Emily wanted to explore how best to integrate the new rubrics into the course. The writing assessment rubrics consisted of five overall criteria (Response to question, Structure and organisation, Vocabulary, Grammar, and Referencing), and within each of these categories there were three sub-criteria. Emily's aim was to investigate what AfL materials would best support her learners in preparing for and learning from written assessments and feedback. The research questions that guided the project were:

(1) How can a class of Academic English learners autonomously assess and monitor their own progress in relation to their written assignments?   
(2) How can I assist them in this process?

Emily conducted four cycles: Cycle 1 was conducted with the Level 1 Academic English class, while Cycles 2, 3 and 4 were introduced into the Level 2 class. Figure 2 shows details of each stage in the action research process in order to demonstrate the decision-making process in Emily's AfL writing materials development, and also how learner feedback and perceptions were incorporated.

# Findings and discussion

The project resulted in improved AfL classrom materials for academic writing and new self-study resources, as well as increased learner motivation. Over the course of the whole action research project, Emily created five different kinds of AfL materials, all relating to essay writing, and all based on the writing assessment rubrics. These were:

.Essay-editing checklist (Cycle 1).   
.Goal-setting task to reflect on feedback (Cycle 1).   
Card-matching activity for goal setting (Cycle 3).   
.Goal monitoring worksheet (Cycle 4).   
.Self-study materials based on goals (Cycle 4).

In the section below we discuss how the materials were evaluated and refined through the action research process, and what evidence emerged for their effectiveness. Suffice to say here that one continuing indication of their success at a practical level is that they have since all been integrated into the Academic English course at the college at both Level 1 and Level 2.

# Key finding from cycle 1: more goal-setting materials needed

In Cycle 1, Emily had just implemented the new assessment rubrics and the Level 1 students were grappling with the level of detail included in them. Every two weeks when the students received feedback and scores for their written assignments, the new rubrics were used as a feedback sheet, with the applicable criteria circled, as shown in Figure 3.

To support this process and help the students engage more with the rubrics, Emily developed and trialled two activities for Cycle 1: (i) an essay-editing checklist which used the language of the rubrics to form questions for students to answer either about their own work or their partner's through peer

# Now let's set goals for your next essay

For you to complete when you get your written assignment back: how can I improve my writing next time?

assessment (Figure 4); (ii) a goal-setting reflection task to be completed at the end of the feedback sheet, which asked students to choose one criterion that they would like to improve their score for, and then consider what task they could do over the next week that would assist them (Figure 5).

After analysing students' perceptions of these two activities, collected via questionnaires and a focus group, Emily concluded that while both tasks were useful, using the rubrics to set goals (activity (ii) worked really well in this context. From this point onwards, because of institutional logistics, the action research project continued with the Level 2 class, but they had very similar needs to the Level 1 class.

# Key finding from cycle 2: goal setting needs to be more structured

Emily's reflection on the results of Cycle 1 led to her re-conceptualising goal setting as a series of four steps as shown in Figure 6, and referring back to this diagram assted her in the development of materials for Cycles 2, 3 and 4.

It was clear at this point that more goal-setting materials were needed on the Academic English course, but deeper insight was required into what attitudes and abilities the Level 2 students already had in relation to goal setting. A questionnaire (Figure 7) was used to collect data in Cycle 2, consisting of mainly open-ended questions.

Figure 7. Questionnaire used in cycle 2.

Emily's analysis of the responses showed that her students were able to express their goals for writing quite well, often using language from the assessment rubrics. For instance, one student wrote 'Improve grammar, I think sometimes when I write essay I confuse some tenses', and another wrote 'Structure and organisation, it is really difficult for me make the correct structure' However, the students seemed to have diffculty knowing how to address their goals. For example, one student wrote 'm going to write more essays and try to learn new vocabulary as much as I can', and while these are credible general tasks for language development, when written in this way they are not specific or measurable to help the student. This is a common finding in the action research literature on goal setting, motivational strategies and AfL (e.g. Fyfe and Vella 2012; Koromilas 2011; McCrossan 2011), and as Koromilas points out, language learners tend to have long-term and rather vague goals, so they need assistance in breaking these down into short-term, clear and achievable goals for use in the classroom.

# Key findings from cycle 3: more teacher guidance and self-study materials needed

Cycle 3 involved the development and implementation of a more complex goal-setting activity than the simple one used in Cycle 1, with the aim of helping the learners determine which methods they could use in reaching their goals. The activity was a card-matching task followed by a brainstorming and reflection task, designed in this way to activate higher mental processes and therefore stimulate development. Emily created several sets of cards, each set consisting of the 15 specific criteria included in the writing assessment rubrics, and then two 'methods' cards that could be matched to each specific criterion. The methods were designed to engage different learning styles, and included a range of individual and collaborative strategies. Figure 8 shows one example of a specific criterion (or 'goal') matched to a corresponding method of achieving this goal. Once the cards had been matched, the students could either select the methods offered by Emily, or choose their own methods, but with the examples providing some structure and guidance.

![](img/06857b340864e9c36b299228d1ef9daae7433e5779f20647b709acf80141958c.jpg)  
Figure 8. Goal to method matching activity for cycle 3.   
Figure 9. Instructions for self-study worksheets.

In order to engage the learners in a discussion about this activity and goal-setting difficulties, Emily conducted a 30-minute focus group with five volunteers from the Level 2 class. The discussion was then transcribed and coded to identify the emerging themes. A second round of coding revealed two key themes: (1) the need for more teacher guidance and (2) the need for more self-study materials. Although the students commented that they had found the goal-setting card-matching task thought-provoking, they also reported it was challenging, and occasionally overwhelming because of the number of cards to be matched. They stillfound the idea of developing strategies based on goals quite abstract, and mentioned that they needed more guidance in this process. One student, Rafael?, said:

Now I think that when you have to write your own goals to improve, it's not easy at alland you need some help or you need some extra information, so it's good to say clearly I need to do that, so I think it's not always easy to know what's your goals.

In addition, another student, Christine, made the suggestion that self-study materials would be useful as an extra resource for focusing on the writing assessment criteria that could be more accessible and time-efficient than searching in books or online:

But I also wish there were more like uh exercise sheets or something, to show how to do it, because I don't know Why or not it's wrong the sentence I wrote, so I need some more examples and I tried to search in the Internet or a book and it takes too long and by the time, you know ...

The other students in the focus group agreed that self-study worksheets outlining and exemplifying key rules for essay writing would be a valuable resource, so Emily then commenced an on-going process of creating worksheets based on the writing assessment rubrics. Figure 9 shows an example of the style of instructions used at the top of each worksheet, designed to encourage reflection on feedback, focus on a clear goal and method, and then encouragement to ask for further assistance if needed. The development of self-study worksheets continued from Cycle 3 onwards, but due to time constraints it was not possible to evaluate their use in this action research project. However, the worksheets could perhaps be improved in the future by including an a learner discovery element, for instance by using an example essay as the first activity that requires students to identify specific issues (such as the types of sentence structure used) and reflect on how to improve the essay.

# Key findings from cycle 4: AfL materials effective for most students

In Cycle 4, another activity to use in class was created that would continue to focus students on their goals, using increased teacher guidance but at the same time developing autonomous learning skills (Cotterall 2000). The activity Emily created was a single worksheet that would be used to monitor goals, methods and progress in terms of written assignment scores and students' reflections on their scores (Figure 10). The students kept their individual worksheets, updated them every two weeks after receiving feedback on written assignments, and referred to them while writing up the next assignment. Emily also viewed the worksheets often, wrote comments in relation to the students' goals and progress to ensure they were on the right track, and also assisted students as they were writing their goals in class time. She encouraged her students to tackle one problem area at a time so that they would not feel overwhelmed, and to break the goals down into manage. able methods of working towards them.

Over the six week period of this cycle, there were 23 'instances' of goal setting among the participants, one instance being when one student set one goal based on a criterion from the rubrics after reflecting on feedback from their written assignment that week. Emily kept a record of the results from each instance of goal setting, which showed whether or not students improved their score for the criterion they had focused on (as in the example in Figure 10, the student improved by two points). Analysis of such changes in score showed that in $8 3 \%$ of instances the score for the focus criterion improved, and that the average increase among those positive occurrences was $2 . 6 \%$ . This indicated that students setting goals to focus on one criterion and monitoring their progress was having a positive effect for the majority. However, two of the 11 students experienced a slight drop in score, once each, for the criterion they had focused on, although overall they improved over the six weeks. Emily also noted that most of the students seemed motivated by increasing scores, but that such quantitative data needed further exploration through interviews, and especially for the students who had experienced significant increases or any decrease in score. In terms of a durable impact, after the action research project concluded, the goal-setting record sheet became part of the curriculum, and anecdotal evidence from teachers and students since then has suggested its usefulness for the majority of students.

Figure 10. Extract from the goal-setting record sheet used in cycle 4.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Goal (based on essay criteria)</td><td>Method</td><td>Result- did this help me get a higher score?</td></tr><tr><td>I need to make sure my paragraphs are well structured</td><td>I will highlight the topic, supporting sentences and examples, and check the handbook to revise how to structure my essay</td><td>Yes-13/20 for structure &amp; cohesion =+2 points</td></tr></table></body></html>

In order to gain deeper insight into the students'reactions to the Cycle 4 worksheet as well as their feelings about learner autonomy, Emily invited four students to be interviewed. The four students, Sarah, Pedro, Dasha and Felipe, were selected to encompass a range of possible experiences: Sarah and Felipe had both achieved average increases in score over the six weeks, Dasha had experienced the highest increase $( 9 \% )$ , and Pedro had experienced a decrease on one occasion, despite an overall increase of $1 \%$ over the period. Three recurring themes emerged following transcription and coding of the interview data, and these will be described in turn below.

# Theme 1: progress and motivation

As could be expected, Dasha seemed to be highly motivated by the progress she had made: she said 'I feel very very good ... and it helps me to be proud of me.' This link between 'seeing' progress and increased levels of motivation and satisfaction with learning was also found by McCrossan (2011) in her ELIcOS-based action research project with higher level language learners. In terms of the impact of AfL materials, Lee's (2011) study concluded that the use of AfL tasks contributed to increasing the students' motivation. For other students in Emily's class such as Sarah and Felipe, 'seeing' their moderate increases in score acted as a catalyst to make them work harder. Felipe said: 'sometimes I feel good because I increase, but sometimes I want increase more, and I think I need to work more, and I'm not happy with my score'. Students like Felipe in an Academic English class might normally be content with gradual improvement in writing, but keeping track of their own scores and progress could push them to achieve their best and take more responsibility for their own learning.

However, it is always important to consider different learning styles, and that some students might not react well to recording and monitoring goals. For instance, Pedro had quite strong views and said: 'actually I don't care about scores', and specifically in terms of the goal-setting materials: It's a good method, but the problem is that in my case, I don't follow it. I follow my own way, and it is difficult to set this kind of paperwork for me' Emily concluded, therefore, that while setting and monitoring goals appeared to motivate most of her students to improve their writing, it would be important to design alternative tasks, perhaps in collaboration with the students and also more related to real-life situations (Cotterall 2o0o), in order to motivate other students.

# Theme 2: self-directed learning

When questioned about the self-directed activities used in the action research project (the goal monitoring sheet and the library self-study sheets), all of the four students agreed that they were important and useful. Dasha commented, for example, on the need for self-study grammar resources: 'lf there is some worksheet you should use like this grammar, this full stop, I always like this. I think it's very very useful for students' Pedro and Sarah both spoke about the need to have self-access resources available to provide flexibility and also to allow students to easily follow up on the teacher's recommendations:

Actually its a very good idea to have this kind of help or material, because we can feel free to use it, and also we can do it anytime, in the break, after school or whenever. (Pedro)

The provision of self-study materials is clearly important on university preparation courses in order to help foster independent learning skill (Cotterall 2000) and research has shown that self-regulation is one factor contributing to academic success (Phakiti, Hirsh and Woodrow 2013). However, it is encouraging that the students in this action research project demonstrated significant enthusiasm for such materials and clearly understood the need to develop self-regulatory skills: without student buy-in, these skills would be difficult to foster.

# Theme 3: learner autonomy and teacher guidance

Although the four students interviewed were convinced of the importance of learner autonomy, they reported that they found independent learning 'in English'to be very difficult, despite their relatively high levels of language proficiency. Both Pedro and Felipe mentioned how they needed the teacher to 'show us the way' by giving them frequent language feedback and specific guidance on how to improve:

I need someone to show me the way and then I do correctly, but someone is show me what I need do. Indepen. dent is hard, for me it's hard. (Felipe)   
Right now I don't feel confident to be independent, because in the beginning we need a tutor that show us the way how to do it, but after we know the way, we can work by ourselves. (Pedro)

Several recent studies have highlighted the important role of the teacher in learner autonomy, including two action research reports from the Australian ELICOS context: Rotem (2012) and Cosgriff (2014). As in Emily's project, the action research process probably had a significant effect on improving teacher-learner relationships, and increased levels of teacher support led to positive affect, a finding also supported by Xiao and Carless (2013). Their study found that a group of high school students in China had positive experiences of assessment when there was suficient support and encouragement from the teacher and classmates. Willis (2011) reports the same in the context of fostering an AfL approach focusing on learner autonomy: 'teachers can create a significant foundation for effective AfL by creating affliation or a sense of belonging for students through supportive teacher-student relationships' (Willis 2011, 412). Therefore, incorporating scope for teacher feedback and encouragement in AfL materials is clearly an important aspect.

# Project conclusions: the usefulness of AfL writing materials

Findings from the action research process, which included significant collaboration with and contributions from students, demonstrated the usefulness of AfL writing materials in an Academic English class in terms of progress, motivation and the development of learner autonomy. These insights are in line with other recent research on AfL in ELT such as Lee's (2011) study which concluded that the use of AfL writing materials can help align teaching and assessment, as well as improve the teaching of writing.

An important aspect of action research is that it promotes an on-going process of reflection on teaching and learning, and continuous improvement (Banegas et al. 2013; Perez, Soto and Servan 2010). In terms of materials development, reflectivity assists teachers in the continuous process of materials innovation. Since Emily completed the action research project described in this article, she has moved to a new teaching context: teaching and developing materials for an Academic Literacy Foundation level course for international students in Australia transitioning between high school and university. Initially, she attempted to use AfL materials similar to those created as part of the action research project, but found that they did not work as effectively with her new students. On reflection, this may be due to a combination of factors including their culture, age and educational background: having just completed high school (some in Australia, but the majority in China or other Asian countries), many students had had very little exposure to independent learning strategies (Halstead and Zhu 2009). Perhaps in this context the students would require even more teacher guidance and more explicit teaching of autonomous learning strategies. Adding an element of fun and competition, as well as minimising anxiety, may help engage adolescent learners.

# Implications

The current paper has illustrated how action research can be a useful approach to inform materials adaptation and evaluation: it can be conducted by teachers and learners in their own classrooms. thereby producing context-specific solutions. In terms of a broader view of the impact of action research, Noffke (1997) suggested that there are three dimensions - personal, professional and political, and all three are relevant to materials innovation and improvement. The personal impact of any classroom teacher conducting action research could be improved materials, activities or strategies for the teacher and students in an individual classroom. This was certainly true in Emily's case, and conducting action research also allowed her more insight into her students' needs. The professional impact could involve creating knowledge and materials for a school and the teaching profession, for instance teachers developing new course materials, or sharing their new knowledge with colleagues through the dissemination of their action research findings. In Emily's case, fortunately she was in a position to integrate the new materials into the school's syllabus, and she also shared the findings at in-house workshops, and local and international conferences. However, she found it difficult to persuade her colleagues to try out the AfL materials she had designed, or to apply similar principles in their classes.

Noffke's political dimension relates to critical action research (see Burns 2005) and emancipatory action research (see Somekh and Zeichner 2009). Moreira (2009) describes how action research can be a tool for critical teacher education, encouraging the development of both teacher and learner autonomy, thereby having a transformative power. For Emily, conducting action research inspired her to start a Ph.D. on action research one year later, and she has also applied AfL principles to an Academic Literacy course she has recently designed. On a more cautionary note, McNiff (1988, 72) warns that: 'action research is political, in that it is to do with change. [.] People are usually afraid of change and will often resist it by whatever means they have available. Action research needs teachers of courage'. Keeping this in mind, the political impact of teachers doing action research might include empowerment to make changes to curricular, if management and policy allowed and were open to change. In Emily's case, she did not encounter significant political barriers since ELicOS colleges in Australia are privately run and have relative autonomy in the syllabuses they design, and Emily was in a coordinating position that allowed her to make changes. However, teachers not in such a position might still be able to affect improvements by persuading others using the evidence about teaching and learning collected from their action research, as well as gains in confidence. In addition, conducting action research collaboratively might increase the impact a project can have (Burns 1999).

Of the other challenges facing teachers who do action research, a lack of resources including finances and time are often noted in the literature (Borg 2010), and Emily struggled with both during her project. While we cannot deny that participating in action research takes a considerable investment of time, we believe that the benefits for teachers in terms of deep reflection and the ability to make informed, evidence-based decisions and improvements to classroom materials certainly justify the time and money involved. In Emily's case, action research facilitated the improvement of writing materials on a high-stakes Academic English course, and she was able to justify the changes she made to management with empirical evidence. However, reflection was not viewed as a core aspect of teacher professional development at Emily's school, and she was the first teacher to conduct action research there. These factors perhaps explain why she found it difficult to convince her colleagues about the value of AfL materials. In conclusion then, the issue in terms of teacher education more generally is whether managers, educational institutions and policy-makers place a high value on reflection as part of teacher development.
