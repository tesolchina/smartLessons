# 1. An anecdote: "Everything Everywhere All at Once"

I kept thinking of the title of the Oscar-winning film Everything Everywhere All at Once (Kwan & Scheinert, 2022) as I was reading Ethnographie of Academic Writing Research: Theory, Methods, and Interpretatio, an edited volume that ilustrates the use of ethnography as an analytical approach to investigate academic writing (back cover). No, the movie'scontent had nothing to do with itit was just the catchy title that ket ircling in my head. And let me also clarify that my thought is not ncessarily a criticism of the book. It is the broad nature of the two subject iscussed in this book: ethnography and academic writing. As Atkinson points out in the Afterword, the term ethnographic has been promiscuously overused in various fields (cf. Hammersley, 2018), and because writing is in itself open-ended, academic writing is broad and divers. The editors tackled the ambitious goal of putting together a volume that discusses a wide range of topics in academic writing underpinned by an even broader, sometimes sippery and elusive concept of ethnography-a praiseworthy endeavor. Yes, ethnography sems to be \*everything, everywhere, ll at once" in this book. The fact that the volume covers such vast topics is it strength. However, along with the varying use of ethnography and the related terms, it may also potentially cast some challenges to those who are new to ethnographic perspectives.

# 2. A very brief history

Contemporary ethnography has been defined as \*the long-term, holistic, intensive study of people's behavior in ongoing setings .. [in order] to understand the social organization and culturally-based perspectives and interpretations that underlie knowledge and guide behavior in a given social group" (Watson-Gegeo, 1997 p. 136). With its fundamental principle, reflexivity--that \*we are part of the social world we study" (Hammersley & Atkinson, 2007, p. 18)it has become a popular research approach in the social sciences. With the "social turn in applied linguisics (Block, 2003), it also began to be increasingly employed in academic writing research as the need to focus on the context of the writing alongside written text has ben further recognized-writing was no longer regarded merely as a text but asocial act (Candli & Hyland, 199) involving real humans in real worlds. Some key publications that highlight the value of ethnography in the study of academic writing include (but are certainly not limited to) Theresa Lills's (2008) influential and oftcited artice, Ethnography as Method, Methodology, and "Deep Theorizing" Closing the Gap between Text and Context in Academic Writing Research and the book, Ethnographic Perspectives on Academic Writing (Paltridge et al., 2016), written by three distinguished academic writing rearchers, Brian Paltridge, Sue Starfield, and Christine Tardy. As the publication of this first comprehensive volume on the topic suggests, and as Paltridge e al. (2016, p. 30) mention in it \*we are witnessing an ethnographic turn in academic writing studies." Published five years after Ethnographic Perspectives on Academic Writing (Paltridge et al., 2016) as the second book on academic writing research focusing entirely on ethnographic perspectives, Ethnographies of Academic Writing Research: Theory, Methods, and Interpretation demonstrates the ongoing and increasing interest in ethnographic perspectives within academic writing research scholarship.

# 3. Chapter summaries

The book opens with a Foreword by Lillis outlining the power of ethnography in studying academic writing. I find two important points here: First, she emphasizes that ethnography is not only a method but also a theory, an epistemology, and an ideology. Second, and related to the first point, drawing from Blommaert (2018), she mentions that doing ethnography is counter-hegemonic, \*challenging dominant values and practices' (pp. ix-x). This second point links with the critical stance that the editors take.

In Chapter 1, the editors (Bocanegra-Vall & Guillen-Galve) begin by providing a very brief history of ethnography as a methodological approach for studying writing in academic settings. They point out that few publications reflect critically on how to apply ethnographic methods, which is what they sought to do in this volume. They then discuss the key methodological concepts of the volume, namely thick descrition, rflexivity, and ethics and trustworthiness. The chapters in this volume all feature one or more of these concepts-some more in-depth than others. I believe the focus on the key concepts refers to what the editors mean by critical reflection. As is the case in most introductory chapters in edited volumes, they explain the book's organization and introduce the chapters. What I found somewhat different in this volume is that the editors revisit the chapters several times. While reviewing and explaining the key concepts in more detail, they address how each chapter contributes to understanding them. Another layr of chapter introductions is provided in the final section entitled The book in a nutshll" I am unsure f this was intentional, but the somewhat repetitious chapter previews extending over nine pages may be necessary to highlight the common themes across the book, because despite having only two main sections (theoreticall grounded accounts and empirical reflections), the chapters have vastly different foci, and some seem unrelated to each other.

In Chapter 2, Tardy focuses on the use of thick description, one of the key concepts of this volume. As thick description is a term often overused (and abused) as a mere synonym of "detailed description," departing from Geertz's (1973) original conceptualization, this is a much-needed chapter. Perhaps because Geert's description is obscure, Tardy unpacks what thick description is in an accesible manner. She then critially analyzes studies that use this concept in academic writing research. Through her analysis, she points out the tool reearchers can use, namely thick participation (Srangi, 2005, 2007), that place \*emphasis on the reearcher and the process of doing the research' (p. 36, italics in original).

Given the sequence of the first two chapters and the engaging, in-depth discussions on the key concepts, Chapter 3 on textography (Sizer) comes across as a rather abrupt shift. As textography combines textual analysis with ethnography, it i an \*ethnographicalloriented research" (p. 57), and including this chapter in the volume makes sense. It also addresses thick description and thick participation discussed by Tardy in the previous chapter. However, I could not help but feel that the transition from an in-depth discussion on thick description to something as particular as textography was far from smooth. Coherence isues like this one may be common in edited volumes that include only a few chapters. Nevertheles, the chapter's content i rich, outlining textography's origins, characterisics, use as methods, and a more critical outook on it as an ethical and trustworthy ethnographically-oriented research approach. Those new to textography and interested in studying academic discourse communities should appreciate the chapter as a short yet thorough introduction.

Chapter 4 by Albero-Posac and Luzon discusses digital ethnography, another ethnographically-oriented research that studies ac. ademic discourse communities. This chapter is a welcomed inclusion, as studies on digital setings and online communities are relatively new. The authors review 37 articles that include online (and also ofline) practices, but whether some are \*thnographically oriented (p. 61) is questionable, posing the question of what is considered ethnographic. Nevertheless the practicality of the chapter, including the introduction of research approaches that best suit this context, such as blended ethnography and guerillaethnography, should be helpful to those interested in studying online academic practices and discourse communities.

The book takes another shift in focus in Chapter 5 (Manchon), moving away from studies of academic discourse communities to the study of second language writing and text production processes. Manchon addresses the field's evolution, highlighting the increase in socio-cognitive and social-cultural inquries and the studies of the time-distributed, collaborative nature of text-production processes and how ethnographic approaches became more central due to these two increases. Important reminders from Manchon are: (1) whether the focus is on the individual ognition or the social aspect, writing sillfocuses primarily on the individual; hence, writing should be studied from aperson-centered persective" (p. 90) and (2) writing processes and text production should be conceived from diverse processes. Relating to the points above, the fact that the author is known for her work in the psycholinguistic dimensions of writing and does not do ethnographic work can be perceived differently: For some, she may not be regarded as a best-fitting contributor to a volume that explores ethnographic aproaches. Yet because of her status (and hence the more critical outlook of an "outsider'), her review of ethnographic studies and the potential of ethnographic approaches may carry more weight.

As the book moves on to the second section, it makes another shif from theoretcal discussions on the synthesis of various studies to reflections of the authors on their own empirical ethnographic studie. Chapter 6 by huder and Petric provides a reflexive account of their research with exiled Syrian scholars who must publish in English and reestablish their careers in their new academic settings. Drawing on a feminst approach to reflexivity, their chapter centers around their relationship with the participants and their positioning as an insider and outsider. Their reflections bring to light the delicate and sensitive isues of working with vulnerable participants, the dilemmas of representation, and the tricky balancing act the authors need to play as both researchers and supporters. Their detailed accounts documented throughout their research process are an excellnt example of reflexivity in action and why it matters.

Chapter 7 by Avila Reyes provides areflexive account of her research studying the academic literacies of \*non-traditional/lowincome undergraduate students in a Chilean universty through literacy historie and talk-around-texts. Through her accounts, we see the potential of ethnography as a counter-hegemony (cf. illis Foreword) to expose hidden causes of injustices and exclusions in educational sttings. These two chapters are welcome additions to this volume as we see how the key concepts discussed inthe frst section are applied and operationalized. More of these reflexive accounts drawing on various forms of academic writing research should make this volume richer and more accessile to a wider audience. Aditionally, the authors reflexive accounts highlight the importance of storytelling in research (cf. Atkinson's Afterword).

In the Afterword, Atkinson presents his own view on what academic writing is and what ethnographic means, and revists trust worthiness and ethics, adding another layer to the concepts discussed in this volume. He provocatively closes by saying that he perceives ethnography as \*anti-methodology. of leaning to listen and then leaning to ell the variable practices of human beings" (p. 150). This statement may be somewhat troublesome for a book on ethnography as an analytical method, but his framing of ethnographic research as storytelling circles back to the editors' suggestion that researchers should be \*storyteller of a inside story" (p. 17). The thought-provoking closing made me think of how I understand ethnography and urged me to reread the book with this point in mind.

# 4. Ubiquitous and elusive ethnography: the question of labels

The primary contribution of this book is its focus on the key concepts: thick description, reflexivity, and thics and trustworthines. Although these concepts are crucial in ethnographic studies (and situated qualitative research in general), they are often treated superficially. Therefore, a volume that focuses explicitly on them through various types of aademic writing research is helpful as it enables the readersto beter understand what these concepts are in situ, their value, and how toapply them. However, one question kept lurking while Iread this book. What exactly is ethnography? What is ethnographic? The editors mention in Chapter 1 that they focus on ethnography as an analytical method. But the key concepts also sem to be treated theoreticall. Furthermore, the book tite. Ethnographie of Academic Writing Rarch suggests that i is acollection of ethnographies, hence thnography as a product (a gre of ethnographic writing). This gap leads to questions such as: Are the studies that are reviewed ethnographies? Does the label apply o all of them? Should they be referred to as ethnographic studies, ethnographicall-oriented studies, studies using ethnographic approaches, or studies employing ethnographic perspectives? How do these diffr? I do not blame the editors or the chapter authors for the elusiveness of the word ethnography. It has multiple meanings and uses, such as ethnography as a method, a theory, an epistemology, and an idology, as mentioned by Lilli in the Foreword, in adtion to etnography as a product. I canot help but agree with Atkinson when he mentions in the Afterword that he ultimately does not know what ethnography is. But if we need to depend on explicit language as placeholders, particularly in publishing our research, we stil need to be clear on the terms and labels that we use-at least, what they mean to us in the context f our reearch (see Okada i press for disussion on thnography and it various related terms). Although doing this in an edited volume is more challenging, one solution may be to be upfront about the varying terms and the problem of labels and to purposely use only one, such as "ethnographic perspectives, as Paltridge et al. (2016) did in their book. The current volume introduces ethnography, ethnographic approaches, ethnographic perspectives, ethnographicall-riented, and other related terms (I tried to count them but soon gave up due to their abundance), and many are used almost interchangeably. Also, the editors appear to take on a particular perspective of ethnography-critical ethnography--and the focus of the chapters hifts rapidly. Therefore, ethnography smed tobe everything erywhereall at once. Could it be our job as the readers to take on the task of identifying what each means and how they diffr (or not)? Could we take on the anti-methodology approach as did Atkinson without being an expert on ethnography like him? I do not know, and I leave that decision up to the readers.

# 5. Suggested readership

This book is intended for those wishing to learn and reflec on what ethnography can offer to academic writing research.The editors (or possibly the publisher) mention that this book is for \*ethnographically-oriented \*scholars, reearchers and instructors in the areas of applied linguistics, academic writing, academic literacies and genre studies. . and also to lecturers and postraduate students working in English for Academic Purposes and disciplinary writing (back cover). Thus, it i not exactly an introductory text on the areas mentioned. Neither s i for those entirely unfamiliar with ethnography. Novices interested in applying ethnographic perspectives to their academic writing research would benefit from first familiarizing themselves with the overview of ethnography with comprehensive boos such as Ethnography: Principles in Practice (Hammersley & Atkinson, 2019). In addition, I also suggest the abovementioned article by ilis (2008) and Paltridge et al.'s book (2016) as prerequisites to getting thefull benefit of the insights provided inthis short yet packed volume. Without some background knowledge, novices to ethnographic perspectives on academic writing research might feel overwhelmed and confused by the complextie caused by the broad yet ofen shifing topics and the use of multiple terms for ethnography and related concepts. That said, however complex it may be, novices may be inspired to learn and explore the various topics treated through exposure to this ok. In my opinion, it best suits those specifically interested in studying academic discourse communities and writing as a social practice within academic setings in depth by incorporating ethnographic perspectives into their research, as shown in the empirical chapters (6 & 7). Al in all the focus on the important key concepts, the thoroughness of many of the chapters, and the varying topics certainly make the volume rich. Even considering the questions it poses, it is a welcome addition to the literature on ethnographic perspectives on academic writing and hould bea thought-provoking read for all.
