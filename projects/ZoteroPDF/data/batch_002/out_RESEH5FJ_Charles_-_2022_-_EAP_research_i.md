BALEAP is a global association which aims to advance the learning and teaching of EAP in higher and further education. At its fiftieth anniversary, it is timely to examine its contribution to EAP research. This paper draws on evidence from a corpus of 1,310 titles of papers from volumes of BALEAP proceedings and accounts of Professional Issues Meetings over 1975-2019. Bottom-up corpus analyses and top-down examination of the titles were used to ascertain the most frequently researched topics and the extent to which they varied over the 45 years. Six topics were each mentioned in over $1 0 \%$ of titles: students, language, writing, courses, assessment and specificity, but only assessment experienced a rising trend over the period. Low results were found for five approaches: intercultural, critical, corpora, genre and academic literacy. Topics that increased in popularity included in-sessional issues, technology and teacher education, while decreases occurred for graduates, language, and specificity. These trends suggest research gaps to be addressed in the least popular or declining areas e.g. digital and multimodal genres, disciplinary/ interdisciplinary contexts, and with non-traditional participants e.g. teaching staff or displaced academics. This study strongly argues that the current wide diversity of research topics in BALEAP should be maintained.

# 1. Introduction

The origins of BALEAP lie in a UK association concerned with the development of materials for overseas university students (SELMOUs) which was set up in 1972; this organisation became the British Association of Lecturers in English for Academic Purposes in 1989 (Jordan, 2002) and became known solely as BALEAP in 2010. BALEAP's remit is now wider than the UK alone and it describes itself as the global forum for EAP profesionals It key ams statd on their wesit reto hance the quality of glish for Academic Purposes (EAP) learning and teaching in institutions f further and higher education' and to support the professional development of those involved in learning, teaching, scholarship and research in EAP (BALEAP, 2021). To this end it set up and supports a large number of initiatives and activities including accreditation schemes for institutions and individuals, statements of good practice in teaching and testing, Professional Isues Metings (PIMs), and a biennial conference with published proceedings. BALAP, then, is an active association with a global reach and it celebrates its 50-year anniverary in 2022. Give its imortant postion in EAP, i is timely to examine how BALEAP's research activities have contributed to the long-term development of the field.

There has been a long history of assessing the state of the art in English language teaching (ELT) which continues up to the present day. Building on earlier review studies such as those on TES0L (Brown, 1991; Canagaraja, 2006), ESP (Belcher, 2006) and EAP in the UK (Jordan, 2002), there have been several recent re-appraisals of the current position of English teaching and it development over time (Canagarajah, 2016; Hyland and Jiang, 2021; Riazi et al., 2018, 2020). The 2018 study by Riazi et al. offrs an analysis of empirical research articles in the Joundl of Second Language Writig from 1992 to 2016, while Canagarajah's (2016) article has the wider aim of examining the TEsOL community after fifty years of TEsoL Quarterly. However, despite these different research ori. entations, findings from the two artice reveal some similarities. Thus both papers note a social turn with a move towards the study of everyday contexts and practice and away from controlled and experimental sttings. Both also advocate increasing diversity in terms of the participants and contexts studied, with Canagarajah (2016) arguing forcefully that such diversity is a source of strength for instructors in responding to the diverse and constantly changing communication needs of their English language learners.

There have been two recent volumes that deal exclusively with EAP, the handbook edited by Hyland and Shaw (2016) and the book-length treatment by Ding and Bruce (2017). Hyland and Shaw's volume offers a comprehensive survey, highlighting the sheer breadth and scope of current EAP concerns in its 45 chapters. By contrast, Ding and Bruce's study focuses specifically on EAP practitioners, providing an in-depth examination of their current position within institutions and how this shapes their professional identity. Two even more recent survey articles also focus on EAP and are highly relevant to the present paper, Hyland and Jiang (2021) and Riazi et l. (2020). Hyland and Jiang provide a bibliometric study of 12,619 articles on EAP from 40 journals. They comparetwo time periods, 1980-2000 and 2001-2020, and report on features including the most cited authors and publications, and the most productie regions. Of particular intresti ther identification of the most frequently explored topics, which allows comparison with the findings of the present study. They note a significant increase betwen the two periods in papers on topics including identity, academic writing, learning process, graduate students, pee assessment and professional development (.5). Over the same time-span, four topics saw a significant decrease in popularity: case study, approach to teaching, teaching practice, and action research (p. 5) Hyland and Jiang argue that these changes reflect a move away from an earlier focus on practicalclassroom concerns and towards an examination of more advanced literacy practices and the increased professionalism of EAP practitioners.

Riazi et al.'s (2020) paper has a more restricted focus; it investigates the empirical journal articles in the Journal of English for Academic Purposes (JEAP), and is of special interest to the present work because BALEAP has been closely asociated with JEAP since the journal's inception in 2002. Riazi et al. examine 416 articles divided between two time periods, 2002-2011 and 2012-2019, and analyse many of the same features as Hyland and Jiang (2021). Thre overarching themes are explored by Riazi et l.covering research contexts, research foci/theoretical approaches, and methodology. Of prime inerest for comparison with the current study are their findings on research foci and theoretical orientation. Their top five research foci in order of importance are: instruction, features of academic discourse, L1 vs L2 (intercultural rhetoric), student produced academic discourse and assessment of EAP (p. 9). However, only the last thre record an increase between the two periods. Within the top ten categorie, it is perhaps surprising that academic discourse across disciplines, needs analysis and socio-political aspects of EAP show a decrease in popularity. Riazi et al. also identify five key theoretical orientations: genre, cognitive, discourse, social and linguistic/scientific (p. 9); they argue that these form the predominant perspectives taken towards EAP within JEAP.

The current work draws on evidence from a corpus of titles which appeared in volumes of BALEAP conference proceedings and accounts of PIMs from 1975 to 2019; its aim isto outline the features of EAP research in BALEAP. Thus his paper covers a similar, but slightly longer time period than that of Hyland and Jiang (2021), but its data sources are closer to those of Riazi et al. (2020). The findings of these two papers can therefore be usefully compared to those of the present work. However, a crucial difference between this study and the earlier articles les in the nature of the data examined. The contributions investigated here were presented at meetings that wereattended primarily by active EAP practitioners rather than researchers. As Davis (2019) points out, there are many barriers which mak it ifficult for most AP teachers to produce research which is ublishable in top applied linguistics journals such as JEAP. However attendance by such teachers at BALEAP conferences and PIMs is substantial. Thus the rcords of their ontributions offer a window onto the everyday concerns of EAP classoom teachers and therey allow their voicesto be heard more clearly. As such, these data represent a parall and often overlooked dimension to the account of developments in EAP, which can complement and flesh out the picture presented by the examination of published work in established journals.

# 2. Data and method

# 2.1. Data

This paper is based on data provided by the titles of presentations given at BALEAP PIMs and chapters appearing in BALEAP conference proceedings. These two data streams were chosen in order to represent two complementary aspects of BALEAP research activity, covering both the results from published work (proceedings), as well as the more immediate findings from spoken presentations on important issues of the day (PIMs). The use of titles was driven by the lack of availability of abstracts and full papers, especially from contributions in the early years.

PIMs are held every year and focus on a single issue of importance in EAP. Data are available from 1994 to 2019, a total of 66 meetings. The number of IMs varies by year, ranging from one in 1995 and 2005, to four in 2012, while the number of title recorded per meeting ranges from just two in 1996 to 33 in 2014. A total of 919 titles are examined here. Twenty-three volumes of conference proceedings have appeared, corresponding to biennial conferences from1975 to 2017, with an additional volume in 1982. The number of titles per volume varies from 10 in 1989 to 26 in 2017 giving a total of 391. The dates recorded here refer to the dates of the relevant conferences rather than the dates of final publication of the volumes. Since publication can lag behind the conference date by as much as four years, it was consideed that the use f the conference dat would bete reflect the time at which the issue cameto prominence in the BALEAP community and would allow bettr compatibilit with the data from the PIMs. Table 1 summarises details of the two data sources.

# 2.2. Method

The 919 PIM titles were combined with the 391 proceedings titles and compiled into the PIMPROC corpus. This corpus consists of 1,310 titles grouped by year, and amounts to 13,469 words. The study was guided by two research questions:

1. What were the most frequently addressed topics over the period 1975-2019?   
2. To what extent have these topics varied over the period?

In order toaddress these reearch questions a two-stage bottom-up and top-down process was employed. First corpus analysis was used to identify potential isues of importancefrom the titles. A wordist was compiled from the PIMPROC corpus using the AntConc software (Anthony, 2020). Then a keyword analysis was performed, using the written component of the British National Corpus (BNC) (n.d.) as  reference corpus, and a list of keywords was obtained (Scott & Trible, 2006). In corpus analysis, a keyword is defined as a word which ocurs moreoften than would be expected by chance in comparison with a reference corpus. As the BNC is a large general corpus of English, it use as areference corpus here allows the identification of those words which are pecifically characteristic of the PIMPROC corpus. These keywords are likely to highlight many important terms that occur in the tles of papers in BALEAP PIMs and proceedings. For example, EAP is the top keyword, followed by academic, sessional, students and writig. A list of the most frequent content words was also compiled for comparison purposes and there was considerable overlap $( 7 6 \% )$ between the top fifty words in these two ist. However, keyword analysis was prioritised since even relatively low frequency words can turn out to be key (Baker, 2004). For example, genre and postgraduate are in the top fifty keywords, but not in the fity most frequent content words. Thus the keyword analysis served as a guide to distinguishing potentially interesting items for further examination.

Keyword analysis was followed by the more top-down approach of examining and classfying PIMs and proceedings by topic, a process which revealed recurring areas of interest. Items related to these topics were then cross-checked against the keyword and wordist data to identify associated terms. For example, the keyword assesment highlighted the importance of this ssue; IMS and procedins onhe toic w idfied  ction3.3) adth tites of the paprs led  he idtictiof thr terms, such as test and evaluate. The keyword list and the wordist were then examined for associated terms e.g. testing, evaluation, IELTs. Finally, concordances were run on this wider list of terms using WordSmith Tools (cott 2011). The results were examined manuall to ensure that all were related to the topic, that there was no double counting ftles which contained more than one search term, and that all titles in arelevant PIM or proceedings were included. These data were then entered into Excel spreadsheet to calculate percentages of yearly occurrences and plot the trends.

# 3. Results and discussion

In this section the results are grouped into five sets and discussed in turn: 1) PIMs and proceedings; 2) courses and students; 3) major topics in BALEAP; 4) the communicative skill of writing, speaking, reading and listening; 5) approaches to EAP.

# 3.1. PIMs and proceedings

From 1994 to 2019, PIMs have addressed 38 topics Table 2 shows that the most frequently ddressed is asssment with six PIMs, two of which occurred during the last five years (2017, 2019). Teacher education and writing are the next most frequent topics with five PIMs ch, followd  in-ssional is four), and P, edng and echlogy h ech). hs ocs e diussd indeal in the sub-sections that follow. Taken together, the papers in these PIMS account for $4 4 . 5 \%$ of all PIMs presentations and give an early indication of the areas that have drawn most attention from BALEAP researchers.

Volumes of proceedings also address a wide range of topics, but given the relatively small number of publications, i is more difficult to detect recurring themes. However, Table 3 shows the early emphasis on ESP, with thre proceedings on this topic (1981, 1982, 1983) and one on ESAP (2009). This suggests  particular focus on specificity, perhaps due to the initial need in the early days to differentiate EAP from general ELT. A concern with the development of the field is also evident, encompassing change (2015), asesing the past and looking to the future (2001, 2013. Taken together these topics suggest areappraisal of the position of EAP and a desire to identify and respond to ongoing trends in higher education. Recently there has also been a focus on collaboration with colleagues in other disciplines and departments, as seen in the proceedings from the 2011 and 2017 conferences.

Combining PIM and proceedings data shows that an average of 29 papers were produced per year and allows the full extent of research activity in BALEAP to be seen. Fig. 1 gives the total number of papers recorded by year, with a dotted linear trend line added. The data show a steeply rising trend, with higher figures more evident after 1994 with the introduction of PIMs. This indicates that BALEAP contributors are increasingly active and sugests a high degree of professional engagement in the field. Examination of this combined data alows us t trace the topics that have been of oncen to BALAP contributors over a time span of 45 years (1975-2019 inclusive).

# 3.2. Courses and students

After EAP and academic, which refer to the overall content of the corpus, the next highest ranked keyword i sessonal (3), which may refer to pre-sesional or in-sessional programmes or students. There are several ther tems referring tocourses and students in the top fifty kewords, incuding the general terms students (4), student (8), course (20), and course (39) and the specific tems osraduate (35) and foundation (38), as shown in Table 4. These items lead into an examination of the course types and academic levels addressed by BALEAP work.

The prevalence of the general topics students and courses ives an indication of the overall importance of the learners and their programmes within this corpus and underlines the practice-based nature of the data.I is notable that percentages of these topics have generally remained stable throughout the study period, showing aconsistency in the type of contributions produced for BALEAP. A more detailed view of course types and student academic levels is obtained by investigating the remaining topics.

There i just one rocedings volume secifical on pre-sessonal sues (1977). owever concordnce dat show a total of 89 ie, amounting to $6 . 8 \%$ of allpapers. Since the early proceedings, there has been little ongoing interest in pre-sessional work, with trend data showing yearly figures under $2 0 \%$ and declining steadily over the years to $1 0 \%$ . Comparing these figures with those for in-sessional issues shows that the total number for each topic is roughly equal, with in-sessional work recording 92 papers, $7 \%$ of the total. However, there have been four PIMs dedicated to in-sessional research, which span an extended period from 1998 to 2016, and so indicate continuing interes i this topic. Pre-1998 there are no papers on in-sessional work. Thereafter, in contrast to the pre-sessional data, yearly percentages of papers show a gradual rising trend from zero to around $1 0 \%$ . Thus, while interest in pre-sessional issues seems to have diminished, work on in-sesional topics has increased. The rise in attention to in-sessional ssues may be linked to the expansion in numbers of graduate students on taught courses (Universities UK, 2018). Although such students may attend a pre-sessional course, it is possible that ongoing in-sessional provision is also needed and may indeed be seen as enhancing a university's attractiveness to potential international graduate students.

The academic level of courses and students is further ilustrated by the keywords postgraduate and foundation. The totals for graduates in Table 4 include all mentions of the terms (postgraduate/s, master's and doctoral, along with their assciated degrees e. MA, PhD etc. Although there is no proceedings volume and only one PIM devoted to graduate level work,concordance data reveal a substantial number of papers at 102 $( 7 . 8 \% )$ . Moreover, these figures may be an underestimate, since it is not possible to determine the academic leel f the tart std wen ti rer smply to tems such as stdent, coure, r-esion r in-essonal. Inteest in work on graduate issues was apparent already in the early days of BALEAP, as evidenced by a peak of $5 0 \%$ of papers in 1979. However, the trend data show a gradual decline over the study period from around $^ { 1 3 \% }$ to $6 \%$ . A more granular analysis, distinguishing between results for master's and doctoral work reveals that papers on master's level became more numerous from 2001 and have steadily increased to a yearly ${ 3 \% }$ , while those at doctoral level have remained static at just under $2 \%$ . While these percentages are very low, they do suggest that more attention is being paid to master's than to doctoral level. These data are not in agreement with those of Hyland and Jiang (2021) or Riazi e l.(2020), who both find increases over time in the occurrence of papers reerring to graduate students, although neither paper provides data on master's and doctoral levels separately.

The other academic level mentioned in the top 50 keywords i foundation, which is the subject of just one PIM in 1999. Numbers are very low, amounting to 34 in total $( 2 . 6 \% )$ . Little attention was paid to this level prior to 1999, but thereafter, a modest degree of interest is evident. The data show a slightly rising trend from zero to about $4 \%$ Of papers per year.

It is dfficult to gauge ccurately the extent of work on undergraduate. here are no dedicated PIs or roceedings for work which can be identified as aimed exclusively at undergraduate level and the number f papers using this term is low at 15 intotal. However, since graduates are typically identified by the terms noted earlie, it is likely that many, if not most, of the uses of the general term student(s) refer to undergaduates and they are alo likely to be included in the figure for pre-sessonal and in-sessional provision. In view of the stable trend for students found here, it is interesting to note that Hyland and Jiang (2021) also find that their topic of undergraduate students does not show a significant increase, while Riazi et al. (2020) actuall note a decrease in papers on undergraduates in JEAP.

BALEAP data also provide information on the firs languages (L1s) and/or regions of origin of students. One PIM focusing on Chinese learners was held in 2001 and one on East Asian learners in 2006; data on students with other L1 or from other regions are distributed throughout the PIMs and proceedings. A total of 22 diferent L1s/regions are mentioned; China/Chinese predominates, with 36 titles $( 2 . 8 \%$ of total papers), followed by Japan/Japanese with 10 $( 0 . 8 \% )$ and Arabic/Arabic-speaking countries with six $( 0 . 5 \% )$ . Adding together titles relating to all East Asian learners results in 51 papers $( 3 . 9 \% )$ devoted to students from this region. Trend data for both Chinese L1 and East Asian L1 students show upward trajectories to $4 \%$ and $5 \%$ respectively. These data reflect the figures for region/country of origin provided by UK university statistics (Universties UK, 2018). They also show how BALEAP researchers take up the challenge of actively responding to changes in the make-up of the student population.

# 3.3. Major topics in BALEAP

Five major topics can be distinguished from the BALAP data, as detailed in Table 5: language, sessment, specifict, technology and teacher education.

Language is the most frequent topic and, perhaps unsurprisingly, both English (9) and language (16) occur in the top twenty keywords. Although it may be assumed that all BALEAP papers are concerned to some extent with English and language, there is only one proceedings volume that lays emphasis on ths area: Language, learning and success: Studying through English (191), while there is one PIM on vocabulary (2003) and another on Putting the E back into EAP (2008). However, these meetings t0 place i the early days of BALEAP and doubts have been expressed recently as to whether sufficient attention is currently given to language issues (Gillet, 2019). Concordances were performed on Englis, language and associated terms, including grammar/rammatical, discorse/s, phrase/s/phraseology, vocabulary, lexis/lexical and word/s. This resulted in 273 instances of language terms, amounting to $2 0 . 8 \%$ of all papers. However, when we examine the trend data, it i clear that there has been a substantial decline over time from just under $4 0 \%$ to $2 0 \%$ Thus there does seem to be evidence of a move away from the linguistic concerns that tended to dominate the early years of BALEAP. It is aso interesing to note that results for individual linguistic items are very low and, in the case of grammar/grammaticel not at al recent. Thus there are only 17 hits for discouse/s, nine for phrase with it associated terms, and seven for grammargrammatical, with the latest occurrence of this term in 2011. These data also lend some support to Riazi et al.'s (2020) finding of a decrease in papers on features of academic discourse.

Assessment occurs at 14 in the list of keywords and forms the subject matter of one proceedings (1997) and si PIMs, which include two recent meetings (2017, 2019). The PIMs span almost the entire study period and cover a wide range of issues under the umbrella term assesment Thus the first PIM (2000) on 'Using English language screening tests for academic study' focuses on diagnostic assessment of tudents the 2006 PM Does AP work deals with asessing the effctiveness o courses, while Assesing te assesors (2019), addresses issues of assessment design and literacy. In total, there are 187 titles devoted to assessment, $1 4 . 3 \%$ of the total, and trend data show increasing attention to this topic, with yearly percentages rising from about $5 \%$ to $2 0 \%$ Of the six topics that record over ${ \bf 1 0 \% }$ of the totl tit (tdents, lnguage, wriing, coure, assment nd spificty), only asement hs serising trend ver the study period, perhaps driven by the need to provide clear data on the efectivenes of courses for stakholders, given the marketisation of universities in the UK (Molesworth et al., 2009). A further indication of the importance of this topic is that BALEAP also publishes guidelines on English language tests for university entry. The findings of the present study agree with those of Riazi e a. (2020) in revealing assessment to be an area of increasing importance in EAP, while Hyland and Jiang (2021) also note asignificant increase in papers on peer assessment in their data.

The issue of specificity in EAP was much discussed in the initial years f BALEAP (see e.g. Hyland, 2002; Spack, 1988). The data show that four proceedings (1981, 1982, 1983, 2009) and four PIMs (two in 2000, 2006, 2011) are devoted to specific purposes. Overall, there are 179 mentions, $1 3 . 7 \%$ of the total. However, these are all relatively early volumes/meetings and there is little evidence of more recent attention to this area. Yearly percentages show a downward trend with a considerable decrease from about $3 8 \%$ to under $9 \%$

These data are supported by the evidence on individual disciplines. In total 32 diffrent disciplines and disciplinary areas are referred to, 123 mentions in total. STEM subjects account for $3 5 \%$ , social sciences $5 6 \%$ and humanities $8 \%$ of this total. In STEM the most frequently mentioned are engineering (9), maths and medical subjects (both 4). In social science the top disciplines are business (25), law (15) and economics 9), while in humanties the disciplines of arts, design and media (4), fie art (3) and literary studies (2) predominate. However, the trend data again show a decline over time in the yearly percentage of papers on individual disciplines, which decreases from about $1 6 \%$ to $6 \%$ . These findings support those of Riazi et al. (2020) who note a decrease in papers on academic discourse across disciplines but they do not accord with those of Hyland and Jiang (2021), who record a significant increase in papers on the topic of discipline. The reasons for this discrepancy are not clear. It is possble that Hyland and Jiang's topic has a wider scope than that covered by the BALEAP data. It could also be that rearchers are more likely to conduct studies on a specific discipline, since this would allow theresearch topic to be carefully de-limited and controlled y contrast EAP practitioners may be faced with areality of multi-disciplinary classes, which would likely reduce their motivation to focus on a single discipline.

The BALEAP data suggest that early concern with the issue of specificity has diminished, but has not been replaced with a renewed focus on individual disciplines or by a compensatory move towards researching EGAP, which records only eight mentions in the data. Nor have BALEAP contributors addressed the ssues raised by interdisciplinary studies, which have recently gained in importance within higher education (Thompson & Hunston, 2019). In fact, there are only two instances of this term in the entire corpus. It would seem, then, that the topic of specifit, and in partcular discilinarity/inerdisciplinarit, i not an active are of rearch at present

We turn next to the results on technology. The term online occurs at 21 in the keyword list and an examination of the proceedings and PIMs indicates substantial interest in the aplication of various technologies to EAP. The first major indication of this interest is the 1999 proceedings volume on EAP learning technologies; his i followed by three PIMs: EAP online (2003), and two meetings on blended learning (2004, 2012). In addition to these tites, a considerable number of papers address range of different tchnologies, including videoconferencing, e-dctionaries, mobile-assted language lening and virtual learning environments. The overall number of papers on the use of technologies amounts to 113, $8 . 6 \%$ of the total. The data show that instances became more prevalent after the 1999 proceedings and there is an upward trend from about $4 \%$ to $1 0 \%$ , with peaks corresponding to the dates of dedicated PIMs. Aside from these, interest is usually below $1 0 \%$ with several years, most recently 2018, in which no papers on technology appeared. This is set to change considerably, with the sporadic pattern of contributions likely to give way tosustained growth i light of the 2020 move to online teaching, which will have helped overcome any remaining reluctance to adopt new technologies.

The final topic, tacher eucation, do not have dedicatd procedings volume, but ther isidence of considrable intest, with the existence f five PIMs (1997, 2001, 2004, 2012, 2014). Moreover, the words teaching and teacher are high in the list of keywords at 12 and 17 respectively, underlining the pedagogical orientation of the BALAP data. There are89 titles referring to teacher eucation, $6 . 8 \%$ of all papers. The trend data show a considerable increase over time from zero to about $9 \%$ , a rise that may in part be due to the large number of master's courses on TESOL and associated subjects. BALEAPscommitment t teacher education is further underlined by its production of the Competency framework for teachers of English for academic purposes, although this document does not form part of the data examined here. While the corpus figures for teacher education are not high, their increase is notable since Riazi et al. (2020) identify this as an area needing further research. In this respect, BALEAP teachers seem to be ahead of the field.

3.4. The communicative skills of writing, speaking, reading and listening

The communicative skill of writing, speaking, reading and listening have often been regarded as foundational in teaching EAP. The data are presented in Table 6. Taken together, they account for almost athird of the total papers, with writing alone accounting for just over $2 0 \%$

Writing occurs towards the top of the keyword list, in fifth place. Its predominance is further underlined by the fact that one proceedings and five IMs are dedicated to this area. Moreover, inteest extnds over almost the entire study period, with the first PIM in 1985 andthe laet in 2013. The topic f writig, then, stil sms to be an active are f rearch. evertheles, the trend data show that yearly percentages have declined from about $2 5 \%$ to $1 6 \%$ and all post-2013 percentages are under $2 0 \%$ This downward trend is not consistent with the findings of Hyland and Jiang (2021), who record an increase for academic writing, while Riazi et al. (2020) also show arise in papers on student produced academic discourse. One factor which may contribute to this disparity might be the different perspectives of researchers and practitioners. It could be that researchers, who are engaged in publication themselves, may be more focused on the importance of writing, while practitioners may be more aware of a broader range of issues that impact student learning.

Speaking is the subject of just two PIMs (1994, 2018) and, with 64 instances, records a much lower percentage of papers than writing $( 4 . 9 \% )$ . Nonetheless, there is some evidence of an increase in papers on this topic, with a slightly rising trend from about $4 \%$ to $7 \%$ and a clear indication of a recent revival of interest shown by the 15 papers given at the 2018 PIM. A similar pattern of data is seen for reading, with 56 instances, $4 . 3 \%$ of the total. There are three PIMs on the topic (1994, 1998, 2015), again suggesting an earlier interest being reactivated more recently. There are no contributions on reading until 1991, but thereafter, the trend rises to $6 \%$ at the end of the study period. These findings agre with those of Hyland and Jiang (2021), who found a significant increase in papers on reading comprehension. Listening is the least researched of the four skills, recording just 34 titles, $2 . 6 \%$ of the total papers and with only a single PIM dedicated to the topic (2009). Trend data are more or less stable at about $3 . 5 \%$ The relative neglect of listening is evident not only in the small number of papers, but also in the lack of recent attention to the topic.

The figures on these four communicative skill are broadly consistent with those of Riazi et al. (2020) in terms of the predominance of writing, with les attention paid to speaking, reading and istening in that order. However, in the preent data, writing percentages show a decreasing trend over the study period, while both speaking and reading experience slight rises. There is some sign, then, that BALEAP practitioners may be turning their attention increasingly towards these two less-researched communicative skill.

# 3.5. Approaches to EAP

Th final se f reults to consider includes five key approaches to AP: intercal, acdemic literacy, corpora, critical and gere. Te data appear in Table 7.

Intercultural approaches are highlighted by the occurrence of both intecultural (23) and cultural (42) in the top fifty keywords. Such topics have been an area f interest since the early days of BALEAP, with a proceedings volume entitled ociocultural isues in English for academic purposes (1991), and two PIMs on intercultural communication (2005, 2017). The total number of titles is 84, amounting to $6 . 4 \%$ of all papers. Given the consistent level of interest, it is not surprising that the trend data are stable at around $6 \%$ throughout the study period. These results gre with those of Riazi et al. (2020), ho find just a small incrse i intercultural rhetric over time. Taking a wider perspective, it i also worth noting that BALAP has responded to the sues raised by the growth of English as a global language. A proceedings volume on English as an academic lingua-franca appeared in 2007 containing 13 papers and a PIM on English medium education was held in 2016, at which 18 papers were presented. These metings attracted considerable interest within the asociation and the topic of global English is a area that could well become more mportant as aresult of the move to online teaching.

Despite their importance as research streams (Ding and Bruce, 2017), the remaining four approaches each record under $5 \%$ of the total number of papers in the BALEAP data. Dealing first with academic litracy, it is noteworthy that both literacy (29) and litracies (36) occur in the top fifty keywords. One proceedings in 2003 was devoted to Developing academic literacy', while a 2018 PIM addressed Academic literacies'. Aside from these two years, the level f attention paid to this approach is low, with no titles before 1998 and many other years also recording no mentions. Overall, there are 56 instances, $4 . 3 \%$ of the total; however, the data show a rising trend to about $8 \%$

The term corpus is ranked 28 in the keyword list and was the subject of two PIMs (2003, 2014). Before 200, there were no papers on this topic and therefter instances are sporadic, with peaks corresponding to the dates of the Is, but ittl sustained evidence of research on corpus use outside these years. The overall number of papers on corpora is 46, $3 . 5 \%$ of the total and the trend data show a rise to $5 \%$ Despite some optimism expressed in corpus studie (Chen and Flowerdew, 2018), this does not yet seem to be an active area of research.

Although the term critical appears at number 34 in the keyword list, there i just one relevant PIM, Developing a critical approach to reading in academic contexts (1994). The overall number of papers amounts to 42 or $3 . 2 \%$ of the total and the trend data show a rise to $4 \%$ with a sustained, though low level of interest evident since 2010. There is some measure of agreement with both Hyland and Jiang's (2021) data, which show that the topic of critical thinking remained constant over their two time periods and Riazi et al.'s (2020) study, which records just a slight decrease in papers based on critical theory.

Genre ranks fairly low on the keyword list at 37 and it i surprising that there have been no proceedings or PIMs on this topic. The overall number of papers is correspondingly low at 28, $2 . 1 \%$ of the total. Relevant titles are first recorded in 1993, shortly after the publication of wales (1990) seminal volume on Genre Analysis' Further peaks occur subsequent to his volume on Research Genres (Swales, 2004); however interest then wanes. Trend data show a rise, albeit only to a level just above $2 \%$ The findings from other researchers are inconsistent, with Hyland and Jiang (2021) noting a significant ris in the treatment f genre, while Riazi e al. 2020) show a decrease in papers based on genre theory. Further research at a more granular level would be necessary to gain a better insight into these disparities and to understand developments in the study of genre.

# 4. Conclusions

This corpus-based study of the titles of BALEAP papers has highlighted some of the major topics that have drawn the attention of contributors over a 45-year period. Taking an overall view of the 20 topics addressed here shows the over-riding importance of students. In fact, most of the top ten keywords highlight practical isues concerning students and their courses, including, for example, sessional (3), studens (4) and writing (5). At the head of the list of 50 keywords, then, there is a lack of mention of items that would indicate a theoretical framework or methodological approach. Terms such as intecultural (23), corpus (28), literacy (29) and genre (37) appear only towards the middle and later part of the ist. This distribution of keywords suggests that BALEAP contributions are rooted in the day-to-day experience of EAP teachers, who are sharing practical applications, inovations, challenges and solutions rather than engaging in theoretical discussions. Swales (2019, p. 76) has recently called for fewer studies with no useful pedagogical import' and although he was referring specifically tostudies on genre, I would argue that the sentiment can be applied more generall in EAP. Clearly, BALEAP papers fulfil Swales' criterion: one of their key characteristics is pedagogical relevance.

Among the remaining topics, this study has revealed the increasing attention being paid to sssment technolog, in-sesional issues and teacher ecation, which allrecord risig trends, while topics such as language, writing, spcificit and guates have experienced a decline over the study perio. Of course, a lack f reearch contriutions dos not necessarily impl a lack of atention to these topics in the classroom and some of these shift in reearch output may be explained by general developments in higher education. Nonetheles, it is important to become aware of such long-term trends and to consider whether some re-balancing is necessary.

This study suffers from certain limitations which should be borne in mind when considering the findings. In partcular, although a large number f BALAP paper tites (1,310) were examined, the size of the corpus and hence the amount of data available s relatively small at 13,469 words. Although the use of titles alowed a wide span of years to be investigated, it was not always possible to distinguish the precise content of papers since some tite did not include relevant terms. Despite this drawback, the use of titles has allowed certain broad outlines of the field to be discerned and gaps in research can be identified which suggest areas for future attention.

In some cases, these suggestions serve to support developments that are already underway. Thus it i likely that technology will experience a surge in attention once BALEAP contributors are able to evaluate the move to online learning necesstated by the pandemic. The percentage of papers on teacher education has also grown over the study period and is another area which continues to merit further reearch. In terms of the communicative skill, ther is already some indication of a move away from the overwhelming focus on writing and towards speaking and reading. However, it is listening that stands out as somewhat neglected. Work on inte. grating skills such as listening and speaking, particularly within online environments would be valuable.

The present study also concurs with Riazi e al. (2020), who noted the need for further research on non-student user of EAP such as researchers and teaching staf, and in contexts outside the university. In this reard, it is ncouraging to se a widening of the scope of BALEAP activity in the formation of a special issue group on social justice. Reaching out beyond their immediate university environment, many BALEAP teachers are also delivering EAP to displaced academics under the Syria Programme run by Cara (Council for At-Risk Academics) (Brewer & Whiteside, 2019). Further research in such non-traditional areas outside the university would be an exciting future development, with the potential to bring new perspectives to EAP in BALEAP.

The falling trend observed here for language issues and the paucity of papers in certain areas has exposed a lack of research attention to phraseology and vocabulary intruction, aspects of language which could be of great benefit to students (Oakey, 2020). The downward trend in contributions on both ESAP and graduate concerns, along with the lack of attention to interdisciplinarit, are indicative of a further area that merit attention. Interdisciplinary researchis see as essential tosolving world problems (Ledford 2015) and, as Costley and Flowerdew (2017) point out, students need a solid grounding in their own discipline in order to participate. Thus it would be valuable for BALEAP research to address the needs of graduate students working both in specific disciplines and in interdciplinr contxts. Finall, iehe ow us se h for gere, itis a imrt t hth rommtions f wales (2019), who calls for more work on digital and multimodal genres, as well asfor work that takes the social context more full into account. Such studies might well prove appropriate for BALEAP practitioners to conduct and could help re-invigorate this research area.

Although I have pointed to gaps in the research record and suggested several possible directions for the future, the sheer breadth of topics addressed by the 1,310 titles speaks to the wealth of research which has already been generated over the years by BALEAP participants. It has not proved possile to comment on all the important ssues raised, but it is worth drawing attention to PIMs on relatively under-researched aspects of EAP such as Specific learning difficulties in EAP (2008) and The organisation and administration of EAP (2012). The fact that such developments took place and found ready contributors is testament to the extensive scope of interests that characterise the BALEAP community and their enthusiasic response to all matters pertaining to EAP. Echoing Canagarajah (2016), I would strongly arge that it is mportant to maintain this wide pread of research topics. ne of the major strengths of BALEAP lies in its diversity.
