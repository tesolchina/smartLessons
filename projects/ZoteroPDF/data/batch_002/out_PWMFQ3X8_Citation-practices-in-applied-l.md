Keywords: Citation forms Citation functions Move analysis Applied linguistics Academic writing Genre analysis

This study explores the complex interplay between citation forms and functions within 26 Korean master's theses and 30 research articles in applied linguistics. By extending the analytical boundaries of previous studies, this research examines a broader spectrum of citation patterns by adopting move analysis in specific sections within the Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion (IMRD) framework. The results show that experts predominantly employed non-integral citations with non-human subjects, indicating a sophisticated approach to research synthesis. Student writers commonly utilized integral citations with human subjects, focusing on individual studies. This article further delves into the intricate rhetorical progressions of citation functions within the introduction and discussion sections across the data through various moves in each section. These findings illuminate the multifaceted layers of citation practices within specific disciplinary contexts and subsections of academic writing, offering valuable insights into scholarly discourse. Additionally, the study provides practical pedagogical applications for English academic writing for second language graduate students.

# 1. Introduction

Academic writing is \*inherently intertextual, constituted by elements of other texts' (Fairclough, 1992, p. 270). It entails the strategic reworking and transformation of previous texts into new knowledge for scholarly persuasion. Referencing prior research is pivotal, llstrating rhetorical and interactive aspects of academic research writing (Hyland, 199). This \*explicit and direct form of intertextuality (Bazerman et al., 2005, p. 12) enables scholars to expand upon existing argument, substantiate their research claims, and highlight the significance of their new findings within the broader scope of relevant literature.

Over recent decades, reearch in applied inguistics has seen an increasing number of cittion analyses acrossvarious subfields such as discourse analysis, English for academic purposes, and genre analysis (Hyland, 1999; Le et al., 2018; Swales, 1990; White, 2004). This growing interest encompasses the citation practices of academic writers (e.g., Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011; Swales, 1990, Thompson & Tribble, 2001), as wl s the use f sres across iffe ciine (., Chares, 2006a, 2006b Hland, 199 02) and genres (e.g., Basturkmen, 2009; Samraj, 2013). These collective studies have illuminated the unique roles that citation plays within specific disciplinary contexts.

Previous research has primarily concentrated on two facets of citation practices: citation form and functional analysis. These inquiries are rooted in Swales (1990) seminal distinction between integral and non-integral citation types. Integral citations integrate references into the main sentence structure, while non-integral citations insert references in parentheses or use numbers to point to references elsewhere in the text. Initial research mainly focused on the quantitative analysis of citation types (Hyland, 199, 2002; Hyland & Jiang, 2019; Thompson, 2001; Thompson & Tribble, 2001), reporting structures (Charles, 2006a, 2006b; Mart et al., 2019, and the usage of reporting verbs (Bloch, 2010; Kwon et al., 2018; Thompson & Ye, 1991) across various disciplines.

These studies have shed light on the different modes of knowledge construction in the fields, reflecting divergent epistemological orientations in citation practices. Becher and Trowler (2001) suggest that the varied landscapes of disciplinary traditions lead to distinct modes of knowledge production and dissemination across similar fields, such as soft versus hard pure disciplines, which in fluence citation behaviors. For instance, Charles (2006a) found that integral citations and human subjects are more prevalent in soft fields, while hard fields demonstrate a higher frequency of non-integral citations and non-human subjects. These differences are ofen attributed to the crucial role of human actors (Hyland & Tse, 2005) and the interpretation of shared knowledge within the softfield (Hyland, 2002). In contrast, hard fields tend to exhibit a more restrained citation practice (Becher & Trowler, 2001), arguably due to the intrinsic value placed on empirical data and the concise communication of findings.

Contemporary academic discourse has shifted towards qualitative analyses of citation functions within specific disciplines, accounting for different linguistic backgrounds and proficiency levels of writer. For instance, Petic (2007) compared eight high-and low-rated master's theses in gender studies and revealed the prevalence of "descriptiveness" in low-rated theses, with citations primarily serving to display field knowledge (ibid, p.248). In chemical enginering, Mansourizadeh and Ahmad (2011) found that master's student writr extensively use citations for source atribution in isolation, compared to their expert counterpart, in research papers.

Despite these insights, existing studies have focused on analyzing citation practices in research articles, Ph. D. dissertations, and master's theses as a whole, rather than examining individual sections. This approach has somewhat limited the exploration of the unique rhetorical purposes inherent in each section (Yang & Allison, 2003). Some research has delved into single sections, such as citation forms in introductions (Jalilifar, 2012) and citation functions in discussions (Saraj, 2013), concentrating on particular as pects of citation patterns. However, there is a recognized need for a more encompassing approach to better understand citation practices (Kafes, 2017; Li & Zhang, 2021). The existing body of work has yet to fully adres the complex interplay f itation practices across different sections. Thus, our study seeks to fll this gap by exploring how citation forms and functions are integrated withinthe IMRD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) framework, using the rhetorical concept of "moves-and-stes' in genre analysis. We draw our data from the field of applied linguisics, known for it sophisticated rhetorical techniques and emphasis on citation (Hyland & Jiang, 2019).

Building on the citation discourse in the field, this study delves further into a comparative examination of masters theses and research articles to uncover how each navigates the complexities of citation practices. It is important to note that the comparison between master's thees and rearch artice rases considerations regarding the inherent differences in audience, purose, and genre expectations. Effective citation practices in student writing may not reflect those of expert academic writing due to these variances (Petric, 2007). Despite these divergent expectations, previous studies (e.g., Basturkmen, 2009; Jalilifar, 2012; Samraj, 2013) have undertaken such comparisons, yielding insights into the knowledge construction and the relationship between the two genres. Our study aims to extend this line of inquiry through a comparative analysis to uncover potential gaps in the citation practices and rhetorical strategies of student writers. This analysis could reveal how student writers are acculturated into their disciplinary communities.

The current study contributes to the ongoing discourse on citation practices by establishing connections between citation form and function analyses acording to academic expertise. Despite extensive research on the issues of intertextuality, to our knowledge, no study has comprehensively addressed both citation form and function. We provide a thorough comparative analysis within specific rhetorical contexts using move analysis to elucidate citation dynamics in the academic writing. This study also enhances the limited existing litrature in an EFL (English as a Foreign Language) context (Lin, 2020; Petric, 2007), particularly within master's theses. Th comparison is crucial for developing an understanding of citation uses that can inform graduate-level English for Academic Purposes (EAP) courses, as well as instructional materials designed to bridge the gap between student and expert writing.

To achieve this, the current study addresses two central research questions.

1) How do citation frequencies and types compare acros different sections of Korean graduate students master's theses and research articles in applied linguistics? 2) How do the uses of citations vary in each corpus, based on the rhetorical purpose in different sections?

By answering these questions, we aim to enrich the understanding of efective citation practices in academic writing and clarif the rhetorical patterns of scholarly discourse.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Citation forms

The influential binary categorization of citation forms into integral and non-integral citations, proposed by Swales (1990), is broady recognized in acadmic literature. This framework has shaped many later studies on citation practices (Charles, 2006a, 2006, Hyland, 1999, 200, 2002; Jalilifar, 2012; Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011; Petric, 2007 Samraj, 2013; Thompson, 2005; Thompson & Tribble, 2001).

For instance, Thompson and Tribble (2001) expanded upon Swales' (1990) framework by conducting a detailed investigation of citation forms in doctoral theses in agricultural botany and agricultural economics. They classfied integral citations by surface features, distingushing between verb-controllin, naming, and non-citation. In non-integral citations, they focused on functional aspects, reulting in th catization f se, idenfiction, ree, and rigin. The ult showdtha non-intl citios prminated in agricultural botany, while agricultural economics relied more on integral citations. While their functional framework has been widely adopted, certain limitations are noted in addresing systematic differences among subcategories (Samraj, 2013)

Subsequent studies have delved into the lexico-grammatical components of citation forms, such as verb-complement clauses and reporting verbs. Charles (2006a, 2006b) adopted Swales framework and further scrutinized subject types (human subject, non-human subject, it subject in reporting clauses within doctoral theses in politics/international relations and materials science. Her research revealed that materials science writings contained more non-integral citations with non-human subjects, whereas both disciplines primarily employed integrals with human subject. Charles framework emphasizes the type of subject, highlighting its crucial role in reflecting the writer's intent (Shaw, 192), and has been applied in quantitative studies (e.g., Marti et a., 2019). The current study adopts Charles (2006a) classfication to explore citation structure in our data and further enriches the literature by incorporating all citation instances from the corpora. Additional descriptions of the framework are presented in the methods section with ilustrative examples.

# 2.2. Citation functions

Previous literature on citation functions has largely focused on comparing diffrent proficiency levels. For instance, Petric (2007) analyzed eight high-and low-rated L2 master's theses in gender studies and identified nine citation functions: atribution, exemplfi cation, futher refere, sttmen f use, liction, altion, tlising links btwen sources, comparison f one's work withters, and other. Among these, atribution was a common function in both corpora, reflecting a straightorward use of citations and the fundamental role of demonstrating knowledge in student writing. It was observed that high-rated students differentiated themselves from low-rated students by employing a wider variety of non-attribution citation functions with linguistic complexity.

Mansourizadeh and Ahmad (2011) delved deeper into functional citation usage, comparing seven master's students and five experts in Malaysia in chemical engineering. Using Thompson and Tribble's (2001) framework for non-integra citations, they classified citation las i ix mai cri tiio surt reee, idiicin, tising lins ore, a rison one's findings with other sources. The comprehensive exploration of the itation function demonstrated novices' extensive use of the attribution function compared to expert, while experts utilized citations more often to support and substantiate thir claims. The current study primarily adopts the citation function framework of Mansourizadeh and Ahmad (2011), as their text examines both master's theses and research artices, and the functions are qualitatively and thoroughly explained with examples. The methods section will provide an in-depth description of each category of the typology.

In another functional analysis, Samraj (2013) examined the use of rhetorical citations in the discussion sections of eight master's theses in biology and compared them with those in research articles within the same field. Unlike previous comparative studies, this investigation yielded similar results across the corpora. One notable istinction, however, was the sophisticated citation usage by expert writers, particularly in evaluating their studies. Samraj (2013) methodologically broke down the analysis, providing a detailed examination of purposeful citation within the context of discusson sections. The author noted that her taxonomy of ctation functions showed similaritie to the steps observed in move analysis within the section. This analysis ofered valuable insights and prompted the integration of moves-and-stes analysis in our study, enabling a more precise identification of citation patterns across ifferent corpora.

The move analysis f a section illstrates how academic writers generally organize and sequence their texts (Basturkmen, 2009), reflecting community practices within the specific academic field. Swales' (1990) pioneering move analysis identified the \*CARS (Creating a Research Space) model' in the introduction section of research artices and unveiled significant rhetorical movements of the section. The rhetorical structures were labeled as "moves," which refer to "a segment of text that is shaped and constrained by a particular communicative function" (Holmes, 1997, p. 325). Each move comprises specific sub-moves, or \*steps," within a text. This genre analytical approach has been subsequently adopted i different academic texs in numeros ollow-up studies in the introduction section (e.g., Bhatia, 1993; Bunton, 2002; Kawase, 2018; Kwan, 005, 2006; Martin, 1992; Samraj, 2008) and discusson section e, Basturkmen, 2009; Dudly-Evans, 1986; Holmes, 1997; Yang & Alison, 2003). Detailed information on the move analysis of distinct sections will be provided later in Section 4.2 of the qualitative analysis.

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Data

This study investigates citation practces in applied linguistics comparing academic professonals and Korean graduate students. Our analysis utilizes two corpora to represent expert and student writing: Published Research Articles (PRA) and Korean Master's Theses (KMT). Both adhereto the traditional IMRD framework and aim for academic persuasion (Palridge, 2002; Samraj, 2002, 2008; Swales, 1990; Thompson, 2005).

Brown's (1988 stratified random sample strategy was employed to ensure equivalence between the subcorpora. Each article was chosen from theArticles' category on the four journal websites, with about seven to eight articles selected from each journal. Artices for each journal were initilly selected by reading the abstracts to control for topic and content. Approximately eight theses per university were collected, considering topic, methodology, and structure. Empirical studies related to language instruction, corpus analysis, and second language acquisition were included, while mainly qualitative studies such as case studies and conversation analyses wer n chosen, t contl for he ffet f topcl and mhodlgl differeces. ie, astract, fos, tae, exmpes, and appendices were excluded (see Appendix for the topics of the corpora).

The PRA corpus comprises 30 articles from four internationally recognized applied linguistics journals: Applied Lingustics (APP) TESOL Quarterly (ESOL), English for Specific Purposes (ESP), and Jounal of English for Academic Purposes (JEAP). These journals rank highly in terms of quality indicators (Egbert, 2007; Yang & Allison, 2004). The journals in the PRA corpus were published between 2016 and 2019.

The KMT corpus includes 26 Korean Master's theses from English education and English linguistics, both subfields of applied linguistics. These theses were drawn from five Korean universities: Dongguk University, Korea Universt, Chung-Ang University, Chonnam National University, and Kyungpook National University. The selection considered acessibilit via dCollction (www. dcollection.net, availability in English, and geographic diversty. The theses were composed between 2013 and 2019, as detailed in Table 1.

The macro-organization of the corpora was examined in light of the IMRD framework in genre analysis (Dudley-Evans, 1999, Holmes, 1997; Swales, 1990; Thompson, 1999; Yang & Allison, 2004). Reflecting on this framework,the study aligns with previous comparative citation reearch that underscores the organizational parallels between research articles and Master's theses that follow the IMRD format, indicative of their empirical nature (Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011; Samraj, 2013).

Section boundaries were scrutinized considering content, rhetorical functions, and metatextual signals (Yang & Allison, 2004) While the overal structure of the two corpora adheres to the IMRD format, recent studie have noted growing diversity n thestructural arrangement of rearch articles, thee, and dissertations (se Hyland & Shaw, 2016). To bettr lign with our focus on citation usage within these two corpora, we have opted to analyze the inroduction and literature review sections together. This decision is supported by previous research highlighting similarities in the major moves of academic research introductions and litrature reviews (Bhatia, 1993; Kwan, 2005, 2006; Martin, 1992). Although introductions and literature reviews serve distinct functions within academic writings in the strictest sense, the integrative analysis of these sections is warranted by their shared objective of framing research within the existing body of knowledge.

# 3.2. Data analysis

To elucidate citation practices within the two corpora, a three-step analysis was conducted using SketchEngine (Kilgarif et al. 2014). Initilly following the approach of Hyland (199, 2002) and Hyland and Jiang (2019) for identifying all possible citation instances, we concordanced all the names in the bibliographies of both corpora. To note, we decided to exclude general references (e. g, corpus-based regiser functional research) in Charles (2006a), given that prior findings revealed no significant differences in this category across dsciplines in research articles (Charles, 2006a, 2006b; Hyland, 1999, 2002) or between novice and expert groups (Marti et al., 2019). Citations with multiple authors were cross-checked to prevent double counting. Our analysis was based on the framework of Charles (2006a) and these categories are exemplified in Table 2.

The second step addressed quantitative analysis focusing on overallcitation frequencies and densities in each section. Citation instances underwent a screening process and were arranged into a separate "annotation' tab in SketchEngine. We computed normalized frequencies per 10,o00 words to account for varying corpus sizes, and the chi-square test was applied to ascertain the significance of differences. The effct ie was also calulated using Cramer's V, together with standardized residuals (R) as a post-hoc test to identify significant contributors to the differences.

Third, we conducted a qualitative analysis in the introduction and discussion sections, considering itation densities and the particular importance of the two sections in referencing (Dudley-Evans, 1986; Kafes, 2017; Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011; Thompson, 2005; Thompson & Tribble, 2001). To ensure consistency in coding process the primary researcher provided elaborate guidelines, including function typologies, examples, and coding scheme details nitially, the primary and secondary researchers independently coded approximately 10 percent of the data. Through a collaborative process, a satisfactory level of agreement was reached on this subset. This iterative aroach helped refine the coding proces. Subsequently, the primary researcher applied the established coding scheme to the remainder of the data. To maintain coding consistency, the primary researcher conducted a second coding of 20 percent of the data with the interval of one month. The percentage f agreement between the initial and second coding of the corpus was $9 2 . 7 \%$ (Rau & Shih, 2021),' indicating high level of consistency across the dataset.

The following paragraphs detail the citation functions of Mansourizadeh and Ahmad's (2011), with examples from our corpora. These functions are used for the analytical scheme in Section 4.2 of the qualitative analysis.

# 1) Attribution

Attribution citations serve to identify the source of rference and provide information. For instance, example (1) ilustrates their basic function by conveying specific information and acknowledging the source.

(1) Schweizer (1999) investigated children's preferences for picture type with regard to content, color, and style. (KMT, #14)

# 2) Establishing Links Between Sources

These citations highlight the connections between previous studies, linking them through commonalities in their findings, argu. ments, or areas of focus. For instance, in example (2), studies yielding similar results are grouped together, ultimately leading to a generalization of the findings.

(2) For example, studies have demonstrated that words deemed more imageable and concrete words are learned more easily (Ellis and Beaton 1993; de Groot 2006) ... (PRA, #2)

# 3) Support

Support itations primarily ffr a rationale for an argument or reearch findings, helping to justify writers' explanations regarding the topics, methods, or study resuls. Example (3) presents several studies that strengthen the writer's perspective on the importance of the issue.

(3) These issues are of importance considering the prominent role vocabulary knowledge plays in comprehension of English texts (Hu & Nation, 2000; Schmitt, Jiang, & Grabe, 2011; Webb & Macalister, 2013). (PRA, $\# 2 2$

# 4) Reference

The reference function directs readers to a more detailed discussion of a study. This type of citation is often introduced with the word 'see', condensing the text, as shown in example (4).

(4) The benefits associated with focus on meaning ..(for a full discussion of qualitative data pertaining to this study, see Jacobsen (2015)). (PRA, $\# 9$

# 5) Identification

Citations for identification often coincide with reporting verbs and encompass a range of studies on various topics or themes. In example (5), studies using different research matrials are efficiently grouped, allowing for a concise presentation of diverse information in a single sentence.

(5) Studies comparing the two genres have examined different aspect, such as politeness strategies (Myers, 1989),schematic structures (Nwogu, 1991), lexical cohesion (Myers, 1991), narratives (Myers, 1994), rhetorical analysis (Fahnestock, 1998), visual elements (Miller, 1998), and interaction with readers (Hyland, 2010). (PRA, #24)

# 6) Comparison of One's Findings with Other Sources

This function involves comparing a researcher's results with those of previous studies. The findings of a study are presented and ompared to earlier research, as illustrated in example (6).

(6) This result of the overused amplifiers corresponds roughly with the result of Lorenz (1999 p. 169). (KMT, #3)

To consider the specific rhetorical context, we paid special atention to the move analysis of introduction and discussion sections. Considering the numerous follow-up studies and the specificity of the description of moves and steps in the introduction section (e.g. Kawase, 2018; Kwan, 2006), we've decided to reference Bunton's revised CARS model. For the discusion section, Basturkmen's (2009) framework was chosen. This framework places a special emphasis on the 'Commenting on Results' move, a crucial and obligatory component identified within the discusson section by Yang and Allison (2003). The framework is noted for its fine-grained analysis and this work has been widely recognized and adopted in genre studies (e.g. Liu & Buckingham, 2018; Samraj, 2013).

We pinpointed mandatory moves and steps tied to citation practices identified in earlier studies. This led us to scrutinize individual instances at the sentence level, considering their surrounding context to uncover their rhetorical purpose. The meticulous process undertaken combined results from quantitative analysis, with a focus on commonly used citation forms integral citation with human subject, integral citation with non-human subject, non-integral citation with non-human subject) found in both corpora. This comprehensive analysis enabled us to explore the relations between citation forms and functions within a specific context.

# 4. Results and discussion

# 4.1. Quantitative analysis of citation form

# 4.1.1. Frequency and density of overall citations

In initiating our discussion on citation frequencies and densities across ifferent sections of our corpora, we note that our analysis utilizes normalized frequencies (citations per 10,000 words) for balanced comparison across documents of varying lengths. This method accounts for fomat and content structure differences betwe masters thes and rearch artice to hance the accuracy of our citation density comparisons.

Table 3 displays the overall citation frequencies in Published Research Articles (PRA) and Korean Master's Theses (KMT). The results of normalized frequency suggest that expert writers employed more itations than Krean student writers (a density of 90.5 vs. 79.6 per 10,o00 words). The chi-square test revealed a significant difference between the two corpora $( \chi ^ { 2 } = 1 4 . 4 8 , \mathrm { d f } = 1 , \mathrm { p } < 0 0 . 0 0 1 ) $ albeit with a weak association (Cramer's $\mathrm { V } = 0 . 0 0 4 $ . These findings align with previous research, indicating that expert writers generally use more citations than novice graduate students within the field of applied linguisics (Kafe, 2017; Mart e al., 2019) and chemical enginering (Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011). The lower citation density among masters students implies not only their lesser engagement in contextualizing their research with related studies compared to experts, but also likely reflects their lack of background knowledge in the field.

Table 4 shows that citations are most frequent in the introduction and discussion sections, highlighting these sections central role in academic discourse. The normalized frequencies reveal that Korean student writers employ significantly more citations in the introduction than experts do, with a density f 58.9 vs. 49.5 per 10,000 words. This finding aligns with lier rearch (Jallifar, 2012; Thompson, 2005), which underscores a tendency among student writers to heavily reference and explain relevant studies at the outset of their papers. This aproach sugests student writr are making an effort to establish a solid foundational context for their research, possibly as a means to gain credibility and demonstrate their familiarity with the field.

In contrast, the discussion sections exhibit a different trend, with the citation density in PRA notably higher (23.3 per 10,000 words) compared to MT, which standsat 10.3 per 10,000 words. This oservation aligns with findings by Mansourizadeh and Ahmad (2011), who oserved a more frequent citation behavior in the discussions of expert writings. Such behavior likely reflcts the expert writers inclination to engage more deely and critially with existing literature, situating their findings within the broader academic conversation and drawing meaningful nferences. This level of engagement serves not only as a strategic discourse practice but alsoas a method of asserting their scholarly identity within their respective fields.

Furthermore, the methods section shows a marked difference in citation frequencies, with experts citing more frequently (13.9 vs. 7.7 per 10,o00 words). This trend may underscore the experts intent toaffirm the validity of their methodological choice.Citations in the methods section are crucial for highlighting the novelty and rigor of the research design, as suggested by Yu and Oh (2020).

Fig. 1 visualizes the distribution of citations acros different sections. I reveals that the proportional differences in citation usage between the introduction and discussion sections are more pronounced in KMT than in PRA. This discrepancy may be aributed to varying levels of academic maturity between the groups. The higher proportion of citations in the introductions of KMT indicates that student writers maily seek to demonstrate their understanding of te feld and their interaction with existing research. In contrast the more balanced distribution in PRA indicates an academic proficiency in weaving citations throughout the narrative, thereby enhancing the credibility and depth of their analysis without overly relying on any single section.

# 4.1.2. Frequency of citation types

The citation types were thoroughly examined following Charles (2006a) categorization, utilizing a binary typology of integral and non-intral cittions wth different subjet type. he chi-quat ral inficnt differece in theition f the citatin types $( \chi ^ { 2 } = 2 2 0 . 7 7$ $\mathrm { d } \mathrm { f } = 5$ $\mathbf { p } = 0 . 0 0 0$ : Cramer's $\mathsf { V } = 0 . 2 4 9$ . The calculated standardized residuals indicated that the integral citation with human subject type and the non-integral itation with non-human subject type both had an absolute R value greater than 1.96, signifying that these two factors significantl contribute to the diffrences between the corpora,as shown in Table 5. A large standardized residual value suggests that the observed frequency in the types i significantly different from the expected frequency (Nam, 2017).

The integral citation with human subject type, which is the most frequently observed integral citation form in both corpora, highlights the human arguments and allows for "alternative positions and voices" (Martin & White, 2005, p. 102), revealing an individual's perspective on a source. This patern is notably prevalent in sofer disciplines and showcases the discursive nature of the field (Charles, 2006a; Hyland, 199, 202; Marti et al., 2019). In the current study, the positive R number of KMT in the integral citation with human subject type shows that its usage exceeds the expected value, indicating a significant contribution to the dif ferences between the two corpora.

Non-human subject types were the most frequent non-integral form in both corpora (see Table 5), especially pronounced in PRA. The distinction was confirmed through residual analysis, indicating an R number of 6.45. Referred to as the \*information-prominent" form (Weissberg & Buker, 1990, p. 43), it contributesto an impersonal tone in writing by presenting cited propositions as facts. xpert writers in applied lingustics tend to favor this form, as it enables the synthesi of related research and enhance credibility (Hyland,

The integral citation with non-human subject type, the third most frequent form, showed no statistical difference between the corpora. This form, especially with non-human subjects is used to present iformation neutally and objectively, enhancing the presentation of findings (Hyland & Tse, 2005). Regarding integral citation, t's noteworthy that student writers significantly favored human subjects, while expert writers exhibited a more balanced approach between human and nonhuman subjects. This preference among students may stem from their reliance on cited authors o support ther arguments, possbly due to perceived limitations intheir own knowledge (Marti et al., 2019).

The quantitative examination delineated distinct patterns i citation frequency and density across various sections and showed a pronounced inclination for integral itations with human subjects in KMT and non-integral citations with non-human subjects in PRA. This observation raised pivotal inquries regarding the underlying motivations, contextual utilization, and rhetorical implications of these citation choices. This led us to transit our focus toward a comprehensive qualitative analysis.

# 4.2. Qualitative analysis of citation function

# 4.2.1. Citation function in introduction section

Bunton's revised CARS model (2002) was used in our analysis to identify important rhetorical movements in the introduction section. Derived from Swales' (1990) Create a Research Space (CARs)" model, this model has been successully applied in move analysis within applied lingustics academic writing (Kawase, 2018; Kwan, 2005, 2006). The model consists of three moves: Estalishing a Terrtory (move 1), Establishing a Niche (move 2), and Announcing the Present Research (move 3). Previous research underscored the obligatory rhetorical patterns and the significance of moves 1 and 2 in the introductions, specifically the steps involving background, 'reviewing previous research' in move 1, and gap in previous research' in move 2. These steps are notably prominent in applied linguistics introductions (Kawase, 2018) and are closely intertwined with citation practices (Lin, 2020.

Regarding citation form, experts' predominant use of non-integral citations with non-human subjects was closely associated with nominalization, which is the proces of converting verbs or adjectives into nouns to enhance language eficiency in academic writing (Yoon, 2018).

4.2.1.1. Backgrounding and reviewing previous reearch. In the nitial move of Establishing a Territory in Bunton's revised CARS model, citation-related sub-moves (steps) are identified as making topic generalizations and giving background information' (step 2), defining terms (step 3), and reviewing previous research' (step 4). Statements concerning knowledge, practice, or phenomena are composed in this section to situate one's work within the context of information analysis and synthesis (Randolph, 2009). Three citation functions are identified in the current study: atribution, identification, and establishing links between sources. In the following examples, citation types and subject types are bolded.

1) Making Topic Generalizations and Providing Background Information

In this step, writers frequently presented the results or methods of individual studies, often grouping similar sources. Attribution was a prevalent choice for delivering a comprehensive explanation of a source, as seen in examples (7) and (8). This function has consistently been recognized as fundamental and widely used in academic writing (Jallifar, 2012; Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011; Petric, 2007).

(7) Hulstijn & Laufer (2001) conducted an experimental study about the efects of diffrent tasks on vocabulary with EFL learners in the Netherlands and Israel. (KMT, #19, 1) (8) One study collected data from students who self-rated their WTC based on videotaped conversations and revealed that WTC depended on factors such as vocabulary recall and anxiety (MacIntyre & Legato, 2011). (PRA, #10, I)

However, the focus of the cited materias was expressed differently through sentence structures. When authors were placed at the beginning of the sentence, it emphasized the authorship of the claim. Integral citations with human subjects were prevalent in KMT when attributing sources to academic authorities as in example (7). In contrast, non-integral citations were often used in PRA to underscore the method and results themselves, as illustrated in example (8).

# 2) Defining Terms

This step involves introducing academic terms, along with their respective sources. Two citation functions were identified: atri bution and identifiction. n example (9), eac term is explained in individal sentences using reorting verbs like uggest, ddes, clam and view. The sources are introduced initially in an integral form to highlight the authors who originally formulated the relevant theoretical terms.

(9) Following the trends, there have been many different operational definitions in the early studies. For instance, Bialystok (1982) suggested implicit and explicit knowledge distinction as unanalyzed and analyzed knowledge, and Schmidt (1990) addressed unconscious and conscious knowledge. Moreover, Krashen (1981) claimed .. Another definition from Dekeyser (1998) and Paradis (2004) viewed ... (KMT, #21, I)

(10) The term shell noun" was first introduced .. This special type of noun has attracted the attention of many researchers and has been referred to as "unspecific nouns" (Winter 1982), "general nouns" (Halliday & Hasan, 1976; Mahlberg, 2005), "anaphoric nouns" (Francis, 1986), "carrier nouns" (Ivanic, 1991), labels" (Francis, 1994), and "signalling nouns" (Flowerdew, 2003). (PRA, #24, I)

In example (10), academic terminologies were concisely encapsulated in non-integral form with non-human subject type, emonstrating the distinct citation function of identication. Various terms were isted alongside assciated studies within the parentheses. Identification is an economical approach (Thompson, 2005) for both writers and readers to present related concepts succinctly. This method was frequently observed in PRA.

# 3) Reviewing Previous Research

In this step, both atribution and establishing lins between sources were identified, with the latter being particularl crucial. A thorough analysis of relevant research is pivotal in this rhetorical move. Experts in this study demonstrated adeptness i effectively employing the function of establishing links between sources. Previous qualitative research has emphasized the complexity of this function (Lin, 2020; Petric, 2007) and highlighted experts' proficient utilization compared to novices (Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011). This function displayed a strong association with non-integral citation forms with non-human subjects featuring nominalization, especiall found in PRA. Nominalization, considered a form of "grammatical metaphor by Halliday (1985), serves an essential academic function by offering distinct linguistic representations of a given meaning. Academic writers reconfigure grammatical structures, using nominalization to present generalized dynamic processes as static entities, efectively encapsulating complex informative content (Ansarifar et al., 2018). Nominalization often involves pre-modification, post-modification, or complementation around an obligatory noun head. Biber et al. (1999) propose the following basic structure for noun modification:

Determiner $^ +$ (pre-modification) $^ +$ head noun $^ +$ (post-modification and complementation)

Consider the following example from PRA, which uses complex noun phrases to provide an overview of sources with similar research methods. In example (11), post-modifiers are underlined and the citation form (i.e, non-integral citation) is bolded. The expert writer in example (11) creates a \*recursive property of the modifying relation' in the nominal group to achieve high lexical density and text formality (Jalilifar et al., 2017, p. 75). Post-modifiers of head nouns embed aditional prepositional phrases with significant extensions. Through the recurrent use of the preposition of next to the nouns (such as observations of $\sim$ and component of ${ \sim } ]$ the writer establishes an intricat lexical association with the cited information. This complexity of forms effctively narrows and clarifies the context of referenced studies' research methods, thereby achieving a more cohesive and economical presentation.

(11) Furthermore, in the above-listed studies, the data generated stem from either teachers' rankings of the relative importance of activity-focused strategies (Alrabai, 2011; Cheng & Dornyei, 2007; Dornyei & Csizer, 1998; Guiloteaux, 2013), controlled observations of teaching where activity-focused strategies constituted one component of broader measures of teachers' practice (Guilloteaux & Dornyei, 2008; Papi & Abdollahzadeh, 2012) ...(PRA, #17, 1)

The atribution function appears in various grammatical structures of clausal constructions. For instance, in example (12), each reference is presented as a subject, followed by reorting verbs in an interal cittionThis method credts the origin of the information and simplifies the grammatical complexity, making it more accessble toL2 writers. mploying this method enables detailed reviews of related studies and it isfrequently observed in KMT. It underscores the importance of acknowledging sources and eases grammatical challenges for non-native speakers.

(12) Some researchers hold a diffrent view regarding components of debate abilit. Park and Hur (2001) discussed devel. oping a new debate competence scale and validating the scale. ...Kang and Jang (2003) defined debate ability as ...Choi (2006) categorized it as ... Ha (2010) considered it to be ... (KMT, #20, 1)

Repeated use of this form, however, may divert the reader'sattention away from the subject matter due to the multiple layers of information to proces. In example (12), the absence f commentary about the specific point of the dfferent methodological categories resulted in asimple presentation of information, rather than a comprehensive discussion of how the views of the referenced studies differ. The parallel construction of integal citations without compact noun phrase in ovice writing could sidline crucial information and hinder the logical connection among ideas (Kaplan, 1996). This phenomenon has been observed in earlier studies of novice writing

(Kafes, 2017; Sun, 2008).

4.2.1.2. Indicating a gap in previous research. In the second move of Establishing a Niche, specifically within the initial step titled indicating a gap in research (step 1A), citations play a pivotal role in shaping the research landscape. Writers in this step lay a well structured foundation for carving out a niche, thereby enhancing the study's acceptance within the discourse community (Swales, 1990). Three istinct citation functions are identified in this step: atribution,establishing links between source, and suport. Of these, establishing links between sources was found to be the primary function, as it allows writers to amalgamate sources and offer a comprehensive perspective to the readers.

Expert writers grouped studies with similar results to emphasize specific research limitations. This stablishing links betwen sources function is most effctively accomplished through noun phrase for clear and concise communication of information. For instance, in example (13), an expert writer synthesizes and links previous reearch in non-integral citations, using nouns derived from adjectives with the suffixes t, c underlined). This efetively eapulates the adantagous man of the ROP as complxty and fluenc f2 oral perfomance, while emphasiing the research gap (accuracy of L2 oral performance). Nominal derivatives serve to package pertinent information, situating the study within the existing literature, and enabling readers to grasp the core idea.

(13) Previous research has revealed that the ROP is only more advantageous for the complexity (Ahmadian and Tavakoli 2010) and fluency (Ahmadian and Tavakoli 2010; Baleghizadeh and Nasrollahi Shahri 2013) of L2 oral performance than OP but not for accuracy. Research is needed to establish whether these results hold for text-based SCMC, a diffrent medium from speaking and writing (see Freiermuth 2011). (PRA, #5, I)

(14) For example, several studies compared meaning-inferred and meaning-given gloss, but the results were rather inconsistent: Hulstijin (1992) and Lin and Huang (2008) demonstrated the advantage of multiple-choice (meaning-inferred) gloss to single (meaning-given) glos concerning vocabulary retention possibly because the former required more mental efforts and attention whereas in Watanabe (1997), both single and multiple choice gloss conditions outperformed the appositive and control (no cue) groups but no significant difference was found between single (meaning-given) and multiple choice (meaning. inferred) gloss groups and Miyasako (2002) produced a similar result, seeing no difference in the efects of the two types of gloss. (KMT, #13, I)

In applying the same function, a significant portion of the KMT focused on the inconsistent outcomes from earlier studies as indicative of research gaps. The student writer in example (14) adopts a detailed approach by grouping studies that report positive outcomes in meaning-inferred glos and contrasting them with those that show no significant differences to highlight inconsistencies. This method, while thorough, falsto directly signal the reearch gap through explicit lexico-grammatical markers. This contrasts with the approach of experts, who straightforwardly pinpoint the research niche by stating 'Research is needed' in example (13.

In sum, utilizing Bunton's revised CARS model, our qualitatie analysis illuminates the intricate citation functions within the introduction section of academic writing. Specifically, our analysis identifies primary citation functionsof tribution, identification establishing links between sources, and support, each serving a strategic rhetorical purpose. Experts tend to employ non-inteal citations and nominalization-a strategy that condenses complex ideas into efficient academic prose. Furthermore, experts delicately employ strategies to establish links between sources, engaging more effctively with existing literature to carve out a research niche. MeanWhile, students focus more on the attribution function to provide a detailed overview of previous studies and acknowledge them. Students utilize integral citations with subject types to give direct attribution to the references.

# 4.2.2. Citation function in the discussion section

This study largely references Basturkmen's (2009) fine-grained framework for major rhetorical moves within the discussion sec. tion. This work extends the original moves of Yang and Allison (2003) by providing a comparative analysis of language teaching disertations and research artice. This framework particularly emphasies the key move 4, "Commenting on the Result, a mandatory move in the iscussion section (Amnuai & Wannaruk, 2013; Hopkins & Dudley-Evans, 1988; Yang & Allison, 2003). Move 4 consists f three sub-moves: explaining the result, comparing with resuls in literature, and evaluating the result. These sub-moves neessitate the use of citations to connect with prior litrature and broaden the scope of the discourse. Note that the analysis excludes the final sub-move due to its infrequency and prevalence in expert over student writing (e.g., Basturkmen, 2009; Samraj, 2013). Our sample analysis revealed instances of functional overlap with other sub-moves.

4.2.2.1. Explaining the results. In this phase, authors present their study's key findings and propose potential explanations for these results, elucidating the reasons behind the observed phenomenon and the implications of these findings. Four citation functions are identified: atriutio, identification, establishing inks between source, and support. Notably, student authors appear to emphasize prior researchers' arguments when interpreting findings, while experts often expound upon existing research results.

In example (15), the student author employs the attributin function by directly quoting thecited author's perspective on a possible cause' for the study's results. This practice suggests the student writer's agreement with the referenced perspective. The itation is presented in an integral form (bolded) to enhance the credibility of the explanation.

(15) This indicates that the interaction between prior knowledge and vocabulary knowledge was interfered. Stahl et al. (1989) provides a possible cause for such results: "One reason for ... with their prior knowledge". (KMT, #16, D)

tudent authors also utilize the support function to validate their explanations. Example (16) introduces another researcher's claim provide a rationale, typically using acording to in an interal citation form to reinforce the validty of the cited author's perspective.

(16) It i likely to be attributed to participants' level. According to Vandergrift (1997), novice learners might struggle to use metacognitie trategies because they have littl room for deeper procesing strategies such as monitoring. Vandergrift (1997) reported that ... (KMT, #2, D)

Nonetheles, novice writers' overrliance on the integral citation form (Luzon, 2015; Marti et al., 2019; Parkinson, 2013), or the introductory phase according t (uzon, 2015), may reect their difficlties i criticll ealuating previous reearch, potentially due to their limited knowledge. This issue might also stem from language challenges, as the integral citation form and the phrase "according to" may be simpler to employ compared to other forms. The current orpus suggests that the tendency among student writers to heavily underscore researchers arguments may indicate an uncertainty in articulating their cholarly stance, as wellas dificulties in using various citation forms.

Unlike student authors who often quote sources directly to highlight researchers interpretation of results, experts tend to focus on similar research findings to strengthen their own interpretations. In example (17), previous related results are synthesized by utilizing non-integral citations to present these findings as established facts and reinforce the study's primary results.

(17) These findings may be explained by the findings from several research studies which suggest that successful and less successful learners vary in their use of listening strategies (Goh, 2000; Rost & Ross, 1991; Vandergrift, 2007). (PRA, #27,D)

4.2.2.2. Comparing with results in liteature. This step, although it may appear to overlap with the previous step of explaining the results', distinctively highlights the comparison between one's study and the cited literature. In this phase, citations ften included phrases like coincides with, corresponds with, and in line with.

This ste fres cittin functios of itio lishing links bewe sores, and oma wth reults n th litere. mong these, comparing with reuts in literature was predominantly use in both corpora. Authors compare their study's reults with similar or different findings from the literature, aligning with previous rearch to reinforce the veracty of the results (Latour & Woolgar, 1979)

In many instances, authors elaborated on comparable research results. In example (18), a specific part of one's study was directly compared with prior research findings.

(18) This result coincides with Hwang (2004), in which the students learned different types of nouns through inference, se. mantic grouping, and word maps. The result showed that .. (KMT, #4, D)

Citations in this step also serve a multifunctional purpose, particularly when comparing with research results in the literature Example (19) demonstrates this versatility by referencing multiple sources and creating links between them to establish the significance of research outcomes (Yang & Alison, 2003). This multifunctional citation commonly appears in non-integral citations, notably in contexts with non-human subject, often in PRA. It has also ben recognized for is complexity and increasing use in academic writing (Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011).

(19) In general, this study, together with previous research on self-regulatory efficacy (e.g., Bruning et al., 2013; Schunk & Ertmer, 2000; Usher & Pajares, 2008), revealed that self-regulatory efficacy as an important set of proximal determinants of human self-regulation playsan important role in affecting leaners academic achievement in both general learning settings and L2 writing contexts. (PRA, #9, D)

This multifunctional citation style ften exhibits noun phrasal complexity and aids in efficient information summarization (Jalilifar et al., 2014). In example (19), inricate modfying relations to the head nouns are shown. The road focus on self-regulaory eficacy is elaborated in the post-modifier f proximal determinants of human self-regulation (underined) in the subsequent clause. Expanding the discourse from the study's findings to connections with related literature allows for effective text organization, enhances textual cohesion, and leads to the generalization of research outcomes.

In sum, in the discussion section, the study utilizes Basturkmen's framework to examine rhetorical moves, focusing on Com menting on the Result and identifying citation functionsof atriution, idenification, establishing ins betwen sources,comparing with results in the literature, and support. Student authors tend to rely heavily on direct quotes and integral citations to bolster their in. terpretations, possibly eflecting a les confident academic stance and difficulty in critically engaging with the liteature. Experts, on the other hand, employ citations more strategicll, synthesizing findings to trengthen their arguments and carefull comparing their results with prior research to validate their conclusions. This multifunctional use of itations, especiall in non-integral forms, illustrates the complexity of academic discourse and underscores the importance of ffectively integrating and comparing research outcomes to construct a compelling narrative.

# 5. Overall discussion and conclusion

The comparative analysis of citation practices in Published Research Articles (PRA) and Korean Master's Theses (KMT) reveals notable variations in citation forms and functions within the field of Applied Linguistics. Our study employed a comprehensive approach, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative analyses within the IMRD (Introduction, Methods, Result, and Discussion) structure. We particularly examined the diffring citation practice in the introduction and discussion sections, along with contextual cues of various moves and steps.

The current study advances the understanding of ciation practices in three key aspect. irst it provides a comprehensive analysis of the overal frequencies and densities of citation practices across ifferent sections offering a wider perspective on the citation behaviors of Korean student writers compared to international expert writers. This analysis not only enumerates citation instances throughout the entire text but also highlights preferences and variations in pecific citation types between the two corpora within the field of applied linguisic. Secondly, a signficant contribution of ths study lies in its exploration of the relationship betwee citation forms and their functions. This study synthesizes the categorization of citation forms derived from an extensive quantitative corpus analysis (Mart t al., 2019) with the functions delineated in qualitative studies (Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011). By integrating these methodologies, our study seeks to bridge the gap between quantitative and qualitative approaches to uncover citation pattens associated with academic expertise. Finall, the study places a strong emphasis on move analysis within the inroduction and dis cussion sections to meticulously examine the purposeful use of itations. This study presents satistical significance for observed differences and provides detailed examples within specfic moves and stes identified in the litrature, thereby enriching thescholarly understanding of citation patterns in academic writing.

Specifically, our analysis of citation forms shows that MT frequently employs integral citations with human subjects, highlighting human arguments and individual perspectives. In contrast, PRA predominantly utilizes non-integral citations with non-human subjects, which contributes to an impersonal tone and presents cited propositions as facts.

The study also underscores the varying levels of intertextual connections established through citations in diffrent subsections, ranging from synthesizing previous research, such as reviewing topics or identifying a gap, to forming macro-level connections that asses the study's contribution to the field. Citations are more prevalent in the inroductions of KMT, reflecting students focus on setting the research stage. Conversely, expert writers in PRA intensively use citations in discussions to advance their arguments and position their research within the broader academic landscape.

In the sectional citation function analysis, we observed that within similar rhetorical contexts, or moves-and-steps, a diverse array of citation functions is employed. This complexity within each corpus highlights the dynamic nature of academic writing and demonstrates how similar rhetorical purposes can be articulated through varied citation practices.

For instance, in the introduction, particularly in the indicating a gap in previous research' move, PRA and KMT display variant citation functions. PRA effectively synthesizes and links prior reearch through non-integral itations, epecially using nominalization for clarity. KMT often employs integral citations to focus on specific authors and their contributions to highlight research gaps.

Similarl, in the explaining the results move f the discussion section, PRA and KT utilizedifferent citation functions. PRA tends to integrate relad rearch findings and uses non-interal cittions to bolster their interpretations. KMT, on the other hand, often rely on integral citations with human subjects to draw on authoritative voices to explain their findings.

In general, PRA exhibits a more multifaceted use of citations within specific moves, such as establishing connections between sources to support her findings and relat them to the broader literature. A higher citation density in PRA compared to KMT suggests more extensive engagement with existing iterature among expert writers. In our study, student writers primarily focused on referencing the indings or arguments of individual studies. This tendency aligns with earlier research indicating that novice writers often struggle to connect their work to a broader context (Basturkmen, 2009; Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011; Petic, 2007). While this detailed approach to citing helped students provide background on previous research in specific parts of the introduction, their consistent reliance on this pater limited the scope of their studies in engaging with the larger academic discourse, particularly in the discussion sections.

It is worth noting that variations in the citation practices between the two corpora might reflect what has ben described as genre. specific features' (Kawase, 2015). While both corpora represent key research genres in academic writing, they have distinct char. acterisics, such as length, intended audience, and purpose. Master's theses aim to illstrate students understanding of their subject area and thir eligibility for the degree. This could entail a thorough analysis and direct quotes from sources to support their argu. ments.In contrast, research articles focus on diseminating research and exhibiting novelty within the field. These behaviors provide some insight into the more decriptive nature of master's theses and the more killful manner in which reearch articles may ynthesize and connect previous works to their own. Our study shows that the distinct tendencies and preferences in each corpus show their unique approaches, reflecting complex and different levels of intertextual connections in academic writing.

This study offers pedagogical insights for Korean EAP writing, extending its relevance to second language graduate students. t underscores the necessty for student writers to understand the writing conventions of thir academic community. For instance recent research has highlighted a trend towards non-integral itations (Hyland & Jiang, 2019) and increased use of nominalization in academic prose (Ansarifar et al, 2018; Biber & Gray, 2011; Yoon, 2018) within applied inguistics. These trends align with the patterns observed in our study in PRA. Whilestictly adhering to native English standards can pose challenges, it i essential for student writers to be aware of the accepted patterns in jourals within ther field as this knowledge provides them with opportunities to navigate and introduce citation variations effectively (for an in-depth discussion, see McIntosh et al., 2017).

This study has some limitations that suggest directions for future research. Our study's findings are based on a specific corpus within Applied Linguistics, which may not be fully generalizable to other disciplines with distinct citation norms and practices. Expanding future research to include a broader range of disciplines or les-studied areas could enrich our understanding of academic writing conventions. Also, the richness of qualitative insights could be further improved by including diverse perspectives, such as interviews with student writer or academic professionals. Adding these data sources would offer deeper insights into the rationale behind citation decisions and their effect on readers.

In conclusion, this research advances our understanding of citation practices by moving beyond simple expert-novice comparisons and delving into the strategic use of citations within specificontexts. By integrating move analysis with an in-depth exploration of citation forms and functions, this study offers a comprehensive analysis that underscores the interonnectednessof these elements.

This line of research would further deepen our understanding of EAP instruction and its effective implementation.
