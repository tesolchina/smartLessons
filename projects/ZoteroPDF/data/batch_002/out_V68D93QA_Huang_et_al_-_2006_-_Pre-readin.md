# Abstract

In this study, attempts were made to design pre-reading materials for EAP reading using resources available from the subject matter texts. These materials were considered more facilitative in motivating learners to read and helping them to understand rather than to decode the texts. EFL college participants read three articles with three types of pre-reading materials—Vocabulary List, Self-Appraisal, and Case Study. Vocabulary Lists served as a more traditional method to be compared with the other two alternative approaches. Self-Appraisal and Case Study were designed for perceptual and inquiry arousal, respectively. After completion of three reading lessons with three different types of pre-reading materials, participants were asked to choose their most and least preferred ones and indicate their reasons. First, two-way contingency table analyses were conducted to examine the preference pattern. Second, comparisons were made among choice groups to see if students with different choices differed significantly in motivational orientation and EFL proficiency as measured in pre-tests. The results showed that students disliking Case Study had lower general academic motivation and EFL reading comprehension than those disliking Self-Appraisal. It is suggested that learner characteristics be considered so that more appropriate facilitation for EAP reading can be provided.

# 1. Introduction

English for specific and academic purposes (ESP and EAP) have become sub-disciplines in their own right and require specific pedagogical strategies that differ from teaching English for general purposes. Strevens (1988) defines ESP by identifying four absolute and two variable characteristics; among them he specifies that ‘‘ESP consists of language teaching which is related to content (i.e., in its themes and topics) of particular disciplines, occupations, or activities’’ (p. 1). The content of the targeted discipline is usually where ESP/EAP teachers find inspiration and teaching resources.

Many authentic subject-matter English texts at the tertiary level have been well established with a wide variety of interesting supplementary materials for classroom use. These materials, however, were not designed for EAP classes. Although they may be able to elicit background knowledge, arouse interests, and foster critical thinking, they usually do not take into consideration the developing language needs of second/foreign language learners. While useful for first language (L1) readers, such material may be a further barrier for EAP learners. In order to use these materials to their full potential, EAP teachers have to survey and examine materials, evaluating them against student characteristics and learning needs. For example, relevant and interesting materials may be extracted and translated into students’ L1 to motivate a desire to read.

In order to explore the utility of disciplinary content for EAP reading facilitation, the purpose of the present study was, first of all, to design mini self-study EAP reading lessons using alternative pre-readings adapted from subject matter texts. By designing a series of three consecutive lessons, each having three different types of pre-reading, we were interested in learners’ reactions to these pre-reading materials in terms of their future choice and the reasons behind them. Moreover, we tried to find out if, under different choices, the associated learner characteristics showed specific patterns.

# 2. Literature review

Reading has generally been perceived as the most needed EAP skill in students’ higher academic pursuit (Flowerdew & Peacock, 2001; Jordan, 1997). For most EFL students, EAP reading is difficult because, in their past experiences, they used to read intensively and focus mainly on the details of language. When EFL learners start to read for academic purposes, the nature of their reading activity undergoes a fundamental change—the language being read carries the knowledge desired (TAVI, text as a vehicle of information) and is no longer the object of study (TALO, text as a linguistic object) (Dudley-Evans & St. John, 1998). In transferring from TALO to TAVI, readers should learn to manipulate and properly allocate their attention between decoding details and understanding the general concepts. Directing readers’ attention away from the language and instead towards the content may be one way to foster a TAVI mode of EAP reading.

How L2 reading is taught depends largely on how its nature is perceived. There has been a debate over whether L2 reading problems are more a deficiency of L1 reading ability than of L2 language proficiency (e.g., Eskey, 1988). Alderson (1984) summarizes related research and concludes that L2 reading is both a language and a reading problem, but finds firmer evidence that it is a language problem, especially for those with low-level foreign language competence. Carrell (1991) claims that both L1 reading and L2 language are statistically significant predictors for L2 reading. Carrell argues that L2 language proficiency seems to be more important for EFL students while L1 reading ability is more important for ESL students. Her conclusion coincides with Alderson’s inclination towards L2 reading being a language problem for low-level L2 proficiency. Bossers (1992) in contrast found that, even for advanced learners, L2 knowledge is strongly related to L2 reading comprehension. The strength of correlation between L1 ability and L2 reading comprehension does not differ significantly for readers with higher or lower L2 proficiency. Divergent views may be synthesized by Eskey’s (1988) contention that, ‘‘for good readers, decoding skills do not become less important, it just becomes more automatic’’ (p. 94). It follows that when we teach lower level EFL readers, we should focus more on their linguistic needs; but when readers are at a higher level, their needs as readers may have higher pedagogical importance.

In L1 contexts where language is not a major concern, content area reading (CAR) frameworks usually divide the CAR instruction into major sequential stages (Richardson & Morgan, 1990). Among them, pre-reading methods, compared to those used in duringand post-reading stages, are considered more practical in facilitating students to read (Gee & Rakow, 1987; Grabe, 2004). Similarly, in L2 reading pedagogy, the use of pre-reading activities and materials is one of the areas that have received lots of research effort. Largely influenced by schema theory (e.g., Rumelhart, 1980), pre-reading treatments are believed to prepare readers for possible linguistic, cultural, or conceptual difficulties in a text, and activate existing schematic knowledge. Manzo, Manzo, and Estes (2001) contend that ‘‘effective comprehension depends largely on the readers’ ‘readiness’: entering the page with an appropriate mental set, or orientation’’ (p. 71).

Carell’s (1988) pedagogical suggestions have been comprehensive, catering to both lower and higher levels processing for lower level skills, she has suggested the following for effective teaching of vocabulary: the words to be taught should be key words in the target passages; the words should be taught in semantically and topically related sets so that word meanings and background knowledge improve concurrently; both definitional and contextual information of the words should be involved; students should be engaged in deeper processing of word meanings; and only a few words should be taught per lesson per week. for higher-level processing, Carell (1988) has suggested teachers help students build background knowledge on the topic prior to reading through appropriate prereading activities.

Many empirical studies have examined and compared the effects of various types of prereading activities. For example, Anstey and Freebody (1987) found that a pictorial introduction, content-directed questions, and free associations with the title all facilitated inferences for Australian fifth graders. Among the three types of activities, contentdirected questions aided literal comprehension most effectively. Taglieber, Johnson, and Yarbrough (1988) applied a schema view of reading, assigning Brazilian college students to one of four pre-reading groups: pictorial context, vocabulary pre-teaching, prequestioning, and a control. Findings showed pictorial context and pre-questioning to be most effective in facilitating reading comprehension, followed by vocabulary pre-teaching. Chen and Graves (1995) compared previewing, providing background knowledge, a combination of the two, and a control group for Taiwanese college students’ comprehension of American short stories. Previewing and the combination of the two had better effects than background knowledge alone in promoting reading comprehension. In all cases, any type of pre-reading activities produced better comprehension than no prereading activities at all.

# 3. Purpose of the study

We noticed two aspects that were not addressed in the literature. First, none of the prereading methods studied explored the possibilities of content-area materials available from authentic texts within the discipline. While EAP reading at the higher level may be more of a reading problem than a language problem, we believe it is worthwhile to explore the utility of content materials for EAP reading intervention. Therefore, we designed three mini EAP reading lessons each with three different types of pre-reading facilitation: two content-area materials plus one commonly used support in L2, vocabulary list.

Second, while most pre-reading tasks and materials have been shown to be effective in facilitating reading comprehension, learners’ attitude towards these materials was unknown. The expected effects of L2 reading interventions, including many of the prereading strategies discussed above, may be very limited if students do not have a willingness to use them again. Eskey (1986), in the very beginning of a book devoted entirely to L2 EAP reading instruction, emphasized the importance of motivation in learning to read, but did not discuss the issue further. Motivation is generally defined as the direction and magnitude, or choice and effort, in the learning context (Do¨ rnyei, 2001). Our concern was with the first element, learner choice, for pre-reading materials. After giving students opportunities to experience different types of pre-reading materials in their EAP reading lessons, we collected their reports on which type they would most and least like to have in future reading practices.

Moreover, we wanted to find out the underlying learner characteristics for different choices. A fit between person (L2 learner) and situation (learning condition) in L2 instructed settings (Robinson, 2002) has always been a desirable objective of both theoretical and pedagogical endeavor. In particular, we were interested in knowing if learners who made different choices had different levels of motivation and proficiency. It is hoped that this type of information would help us design instruction that could better fit student characteristics.

# 4. Three mini EAP reading lessons

The first author of the paper holds an MBA degree plus 8 years of business experience and has taught Organizational Behavior (OB) at college level. Initial assessment indicated that OB materials were suitable for EAP reading exercises because OB is a subject most college business majors have to take and the topic is heavy in linguistic use, rather than in mathematics.

The widely used OB textbook, Organizational Behavior: Concepts, Controversies, Applications (Robbins, 1994; 7th edition) was used as the source of reading. The three topics selected were: Job Satisfaction, Early Motivation Theories, and Leadership. Passages were adapted from the relevant chapters to form coherent articles for in-class reading. No attempt was made to reduce the difficulty of the readings, which were reviewed by a native English-speaking OB professor for coherence. Each article was approximately 1800 words long and reflected a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of about 12 (calculated using Word 2000’s readability scale). Graphs, tables, and illustrations, as well as typeset styles, were reproduced to aid in comprehension. Fifteen multiple-choice questions in Chinese (the learners’ L1) were prepared for each of the three articles, to be answered upon completion of the relevant reading passage. All three articles were linguistically equivalent in terms of length and difficulty, grammar, and discourse. The original sequence of the three articles was maintained, with Job Satisfaction coming first, Early Motivation Theories second, and Leadership last.

# 4.1. The design of pre-reading materials

Based on the attention-getting strategies of Keller’s (1987) Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction (ARCS) model of motivational design, of the seven different types of supplementary materials in the OB text, Case Incidents and Learning About Yourself Exercises were considered to have the highest potential in building background knowledge and arousing learning interest. These were adapted and translated as two different types of pre-reading materials—Case Study and Self-Appraisal. Case Study (CAS) met the requirements of inquiry arousal and Self-Appraisal (SAP) met those of perceptual arousal, as indicated in Table 1. A third set of materials (a more traditional, language-oriented Vocabulary List—VOC) was created by following Carell’s (1988) guidelines as discussed in Section 2.

# 4.1.1. Vocabulary list (VOC)

Twenty key vocabulary items were chosen from each of the three articles and their L1 equivalents were provided in parallel lists. They were explained so as to best facilitate participants’ understanding of the article they were about to read. Unlike SAP and CAS, VOC represented a more traditional approach with learners’ language need as the major concern.

# 4.1.2. Self-appraisal (SAP)

Self-appraisals used in this research included short exercises that asked participants to respond to short questions concerning their own personalities, beliefs, and attitudes related to the topics to be read. The materials were adapted from the Chinese version by the researcher. Interpretation of the results was provided to participants when they finished answering the quiz-like appraisals. Guiding questions at the end of the exercise linked the material to the reading.

# 4.1.3. Case study (CAS)

Case studies were short case descriptions presenting real-world business problems in organizations that were relevant to the topics to be read. The researchers adapted materials again with consultation from the OB professor. Participants read the translated Chinese version and similar guiding questions that were written concerning the case read.

# 4.2. The language of pre-reading materials

One note regarding the language of pre-reading materials should be mentioned here. Although supplementary materials can stimulate learners to read the relevant EAP texts, EFL teachers seldom use them since they present an additional linguistic burden for EFL students. The reason is that learners are busy enough decoding main texts; supplementary materials, however interesting and stimulating, can only make EFL students more confused lexically and syntactically. The positive effects of such material on nativespeakers would not apply to EFL students because of their lack of language competency. In contrast, if the materials could be presented in the learners’ L1, the positive influence could be generated. In order for our alternative pre-reading materials to function well, CAS and SAP were adapted from the Chinese version of the textbook (Li, Li, & Chao, 1994).

After establishing the three EAP reading lessons, each with three different types of prereading materials, our specific research questions were: (1) Did learners choose any type of pre-reading materials more than others? and (2) Did learners with different choices differ from each other in their motivation and proficiency level?

# 5. Method

# 5.1. Participants

The participants were 75 Taiwanese college freshmen majoring in management, 48 females and 27 males, enrolled in a required freshman English course offered to students in the School of Management. All participants had received at least 6 years of formal English education. At the time of the experiment, the participants were all using English-language textbooks in some of their specialized management courses, as required by their contentarea teachers.

# 5.2. Learner factors

In order to address the second research question, data on learner factors were collected as dependent variables with their reported choice as the independent variable for statistical analysis. Three scales were used: General Academic Motivation (GAM), EFL Learning Motivation (ELM), and EFL Reading Comprehension (ERC). GAM (shown in Appendix A) was a 10-item Likert-type questionnaire adapted from Montgomery’s (1999) Scale of Academic Motivation. Second, ELM (shown in Appendix B) was a 20-item questionnaire adapted from the Desire to Learn and Motivational Intensity subsections of Gardner,

Tremblay, and Masgoret’s (1997) version of the Attitude/Motivation Test Battery (AMTB). These two scales took the form of statements on a 7-point Likert scale. Pilot tests were employed and adjustments were made where needed, resulting in a Cronbach alpha level of reliability equal to .92. The ERC measure contained 20 multiple-choice questions on four articles. Participants were given $2 5 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ to work on this EFL comprehension test without consulting dictionaries or discussing with teachers and classmates.

# 5.3. Procedures

All participants read three articles in the same order (Job Satisfaction, Early Motivation Theories, and Leadership). Participants were randomly assigned to one of the three treatment orders (see Table 2). The researcher met with the participants during their weekly class time for a total of four meetings, with the learner factor tests administered at the first meeting and the remaining three used by participants to complete the reading of a single article at each meeting.

During the second, third, and fourth meetings, participants were given 10 minutes to work on the assigned pre-reading materials. They then read the guiding questions and were reminded to think about these questions later as they read the articles. Thirty-five minutes were allotted to the main reading. Participants were encouraged to refer to dictionaries and other resource materials they had and to mark on the texts. After the reading was completed, 15 min were allotted to work on 15 comprehension questions. Participants were allowed to refer back to the texts and any notes made. Finally, at the end of the fourth class meeting, written instructions were given for learners to choose two pre-reading materials and answer the following questions: ‘‘If you were going to read similar articles again and you had a choice among the three types of pre-reading materials, which one would you choose to have? Why? Which one would be the least possible choice? Why?’’

# 6.1. Analyses of choices for treatments and the reasons

After dropping incomplete data sets, two $3 \times 3$ contingency table analyses were conducted to evaluate the homogeneity of proportions of the most and least preferred choices. No significant difference was found among the best choices of the three groups of participants (Pearson $\chi ^ { 2 } ( 4 , \ N = 5 3 ) = 3 . 0 7$ , $p = . 5 5$ , Cramer’s $V = . 1 7$ ). However, there was significant difference among groups for the least preferred choice (Pearson $\chi ^ { 2 } ( 4 , N = 5 3 ) = 1 3 . 5 8$ , $p = . 0 1$ , Cramer’s $V = . 3 6$ ). The observed counts and percentages are shown in Table 3.

Follow-up pairwise comparisons were conducted to evaluate the difference among participant choices. The significant pairwise differences were between VOC and CAS (Pearson $\chi ^ { 2 } ( 4 , N = 5 3 ) = \mathring { 9 . 6 8 }$ , $p = . 0 1$ , Cramer’s $V = . 5 7$ ) and between SAP and CAS (Pearson $\gamma ^ { 2 } ( 4 , N = 5 3 ) = 8 . 8 0 , p = . 0 1$ , Cramer’s $V = . 5 7$ ). Significantly fewer participants chose CAS as their least preferred pre-reading material than those choosing the other two treatments.

Participants’ reasons for their choices were summarized in Table 4. In general, participants’ written responses indicated that VOC was preferred mainly because it aided comprehension directly; SAP was liked mainly because it was interesting; CAS was chosen mainly because it prepared them for reading and broadened their perspectives. As for why the pre-readings were disliked, the main reasons were boredom for the VOC; lack of assistance in comprehension for SAP; and difficulty for CAS.

# 6.2. Comparison of participant characteristics by their preferences

Two-way MANOVA was conducted to see if any relationship between choices and learner factors existed. The two independent variables were the participants’ reported most and least preferred choices. The dependent variables were GAM, ELM, and ERC. No significant difference was found among the three groups in their most-liked pre-reading material on the pre-test variables, Wilks’ $\lambda = . 8 9$ , $F ( 5 , \ 4 9 ) = . 9 3 $ , $p = . 4 8$ , multivariate $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 6$ . However, significant difference was found among the three groups in their dislike on the dependent variables, Wilks’ $\lambda = . 7 5$ , $F ( 5 , 4 9 ) = 2 . 4 7$ , $p = . 0 3$ , multivariate $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 1 4$ . No significant difference was found for the interaction of the two factors (most and least preferred materials), Wilks’ $\lambda = . 8 8$ , $F ( 5 , 4 9 ) = 2 . 1 6$ , $p = . 1 1$ , multivariate $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 1 2$ .

In order to compare among the groups of participants who chose VOC, SAP or CAS as their dislike, one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) on each of the dependent variables (including GAM, ELM, and ERC) were conducted as follow-up tests to the MANOVA. The ANOVA was significant for GAM, $F ( 2 , \ 5 2 ) = 5 . 3 0 , \ \bar { p = . 0 1 } , \ \eta ^ { 2 } = . 1 7$ and for ERC, $F ( 2 , \ 5 2 ) = 3 . 8 4$ , $p = . 0 3$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 1 3$ . No significant difference was found in ELM, $F ( 2 , 5 2 ) = . 1 3$ , $p = . 8 8$ , $\eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 1$ .

Post hoc analyses to the univariate ANOVA for the GAM scores consisted of conducting pairwise comparisons to find out which two dislike groups differed significantly. The group of participants choosing CAS as their least preferred pre-reading material had significantly lower GAM scores in comparison with the group choosing SAP $( p = . 0 0 )$ and the group choosing VOC $( p = . 0 1 $ ). The group choosing CAS as the least preferred material also had significantly lower ERC scores than the group choosing SAP $( p = . 0 1 )$ . There was no significant difference found between the VOC and SAP groups, nor was there any difference found between the VOC and CAS groups.

# 7. Discussion and implications

Significantly fewer participants chose CAS as their least preferred material, but no difference was found in the choice of most preferred material. L1 reading motivation researcher McCombs (1997) has pointed out that what may motivate a particular student may not motivate another. Motivation, unlike comprehension, is less straightforward and may be multidirectional. The analyses of reasons provided by participants seem to indicate that each learner may be motivated by different materials for his or her own unique reasons. SAP and CAS were at the same time liked and disliked by participants. VOC, though designed to contrast with the other two, was in general indistinguishable from the other two types of materials as shown by participants’ reported preferences/dislikes. This shows that language support may also motivate students if it is perceived as facilitative for comprehension.

The results for the second research question seem to suggest that more intellectually challenging materials may appeal to students with higher academic motivation and higher EFL proficiency. But the same materials may not be perceived in a similar way by students whose academic motivation and EFL proficiency is lower. On the contrary, to those students with lower academic motivation, it seems materials should remain simple and interesting in order to attract their attention.

Reasons participants provided for their preference and dislike seemed to confirm the above reasoning. Positive feelings towards SAP were fun oriented whereas positive feelings towards CAS were based on understanding of the texts. On the other hand, negative feelings towards SAP were related to its lack of assistance in understanding the text, whereas negative feelings towards CAS were mainly complaints about the complicatedness and boredom. That is, participants associated CAS with an understanding of the texts, but SAP with fun and not with the text.

The teachers’ decision on what types of materials to use should be based in part on a better understanding of students, in particular through an assessment of learners’ academic motivation and EFL proficiency levels. The mismatch in this respect may cause learners to feel negative about the learning materials they receive. This is a point that has not been brought up in past literature on L2 motivation. To further understand this point, we refer to literature outside of the L2 field. We will provide an explanation of the above argument in terms of two types of curiosity and, more specifically, a seductive interest in reading.

# 7.1. Epistemic vs. perceptual curiosity

In designing the study, CAS was chosen in accordance with Keller’s (1987) principle of inquiry arousal and SAP was chosen in accordance with Keller’s principle of perceptual arousal. Participants’ perception difference between the two types of material was somewhat analogous to Berlyne’s (1965) distinction, later used both by Keller (1983) and Arnone and Small (1995), between epistemic and perceptual curiosity. As indicated by Arnone and Small (1995), epistemic curiosity leads to an information-seeking and problemsolving behavior that occurs as a result of the stimulation of curiosity. On the other hand, perceptual curiosity is a more sensory-level reaction; it is selective attention in response to particular objects in the environment. Other similar pairs of terms representing similar concepts include Malone’s (1981) cognitive and sensory curiosity, Arnone and Small’s (1995) specific and diversive curiosity, as well as Kintsch’s (1980) cognitive and emotional interest. CAS, disliked by students with lower academic motivation and EFL proficiency and preferred by students with higher academic motivation and EFL proficiency, seemed to induce a kind of situational motivation similar to the higher-level epistemic curiosity. Self-Appraisals, however, seemed to induce situational motivation similar to the lowerlevel perceptual curiosity and had characteristics that were more controversial and required more caution in research and classroom practices as they resembled the kind of seductive interest discussed in L1 reading literature.

# 7.2. Seductive interest and reading

L1 reading researchers (e.g., Wade, Schraw, Buxton, & Hayes, 1993) have pursued ways to make expository texts more interesting by embedding personalized anecdotes and highly interesting but nonessential details within the core material. They found this kind of interesting but unimportant information to be effective in stirring up interest but not necessarily in facilitating learning, and therefore termed it seductive interest (Garner, Gillingham, & White, 1989). Studies (e.g., Wade et al., 1993) have found that adding seductive details to texts does not facilitate, and may even interfere with, the learning of important information. After all, attention given to highly interesting information, as the relative L1 literature suggests, may be quite different from attention given to important but uninteresting kinds of information.

The nature of SAP seemed to be quite close to those of seductive details embedded in texts by L1 reading researchers. The fact that the majority of participants who preferred SAP viewed it as interesting and those who disliked it considered it irrelevant to the EAP text makes SAP appear to be similar to seductive interest. Since most reading researchers agree on the effects of seductive details in texts and at the same time reveal their reservation on the possibility of such effects leading to ultimate learning, the effect of SAP should be viewed with similar caution.

# 7.3. Pedagogical implications

Learner factors, in particular their GAM and EFL proficiency, may be related to their ready acceptance of specific types of pedagogical materials. Knowledge about these learner factors may help classroom teachers in making informed judgments in choosing the right kind of facilitation. If there are mismatches, intended effects may be seriously diminished. In addition, more effort should be given to designing motivational strategies for students of lower academic motivation and EFL proficiency. Although materials such as SAP seemed to arouse a higher situational motivation in them, teachers should be cautious about such situational effects. Lessons from seductive interest research in L1 reading inform us that materials of this type may bring about attention from learners who originally are not interested in the content itself. However, in order for an aroused initial attention to be directed to learning, subsequent teacher facilitation and guidance to the major objectives of learning are especially important. Finally, the two types of materials, traditional language-oriented ones as well as reading-oriented ones from the subject area, seemed to influence students in the anticipated direction. From the written responses provided by participants regarding their preferences of pre-reading materials, CAS seemed to contribute to both motivation and comprehension. Although in the design of this study, different types of materials were used to make comparisons for research purposes, in everyday classroom practices these facilitations do not have to be exclusive of each other and teachers should use discretion in deciding what best serves the learning purposes for their particular learner groups.

# 7.4. Limitations of the study and implications for future research

This study examined learner response to alternative pre-reading materials in an EAP reading situation and the relationship between learner factors (in particular, GAM and ERC) and the types of materials learners prefer. Some limitations, however, should be noted in interpreting the results of this study.

First, the participants were not selected through random sampling and therefore the interpretation of results should be generalized with care. Using different learner groups, such as senior Engineering majors, may reveal different pictures of the nature and impact of pre-reading materials.

Second, in designing the reading experiments, the length and difficulty of authentic EAP articles were maintained to reflect the real reading task students encounter in their textbooks. However, whether learners are adequately able to cope with articles of such length and complexity without teacher intervention during the process of reading was not addressed. In order to rule out possible confounding factors, such as tiredness from reading long texts, or frustration encountered in the reading process, future research may break down the authentic articles into more manageable passages for learners to complete during class hours. The difficulty of texts, however, should probably not be altered unless linguistically simplified EAP course books become widely available in the marketplace.

Third, we kept the time spent on pre-reading materials to a minimum so that enough class time could be allocated to the reading task itself. All materials were designed into a one-page written instruction with similar guiding questions. None of the materials, however, were fully elaborated by the researcher or discussed by students in class. The manipulation of pre-reading materials in this experiment thus did not adequately reflect most classroom situations where either more time would be given to class discussion or the materials would be assigned before class meetings. This technical issue should be considered by future researchers interested in adopting similar materials.

Finally, the instrument used to understand students’ choices was short self-reports. In order to establish higher validity of results and interpretation, it would be more interesting to interview at least some of the students to get at a deeper level of understanding of the students’ choices.
