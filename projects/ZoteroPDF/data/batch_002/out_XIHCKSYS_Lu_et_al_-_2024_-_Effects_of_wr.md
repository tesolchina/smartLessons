Cross-linguistic perspective

While the educational field has made progress in comprehending student feedback literacy, its impact on feedback engagement and student writing performance remains insufficiently explored. Furthermore, the cross-linguistic perspective has not yet been introduced to the literature on student feedback literacy, even though this approach has seen increased utilization in both L1 and L2 learning research. The current study examined the relationship between L1 and L2 writing feedback literacies and how they may contribute to L2 feedback engagement and L2 writing performance. Data were collected from 231 English major sophomore students from a Chinese university. The structural equation modeling analyses results showed that students’ L1 writing feedback literacy had a positive effect on their L2 writing feedback literacy. Further, L1 writing feedback literacy exerted an indirect effect on L2 writing performance via L2 writing feedback literacy and L2 feedback engagement. These findings underscore the pivotal role of L1 writing feedback literacy in L2 development and provide empirical evidence elucidating the close relationship between student feedback literacy and feedback engagement. The study concludes with pedagogical suggestions based on the observed outcomes.

# 1. Introduction

The integration of feedback as a pedagogical tool has garnered increased attention in second language (L2) writing classes within higher education due to its recognized positive roles in L2 learners’ writing development (Crosthwaite et al., 2022; Hyland & Hyland, 2019; Yu et al., 2023). Despite extensive research on optimizing learning benefits from feedback, which includes investigations into effective feedback-giving strategies (Yu et al., 2020), diverse forms of feedback (Crosthwaite et al., 2020), and varied delivery methods (Wood, 2022), the outcomes have yielded inconclusive findings.

In emphasizing the pivotal role of students in utilizing feedback to enhance their writing (Yu et al., 2023), scholars have highlighted the necessity of tracing the optimization of learning benefits back to two fundamental factors: students’ capacity to utilize feedback, known as student feedback literacy (Nieminen & Carless, 2023; Yu & Liu, 2021), and students’ responses to feedback, referred to as feedback engagement (Mao & Lee, 2023; Zhang & Hyland, 2022). These factors, encompassing capacity and behavior, jointly form the essential prerequisites for realizing the benefits derived from feedback.

However, scant scholarly attention has been directed towards the relationship between student feedback literacy and feedback engagement, let alone establishing a connection between them and the subsequent outcome of students’ utilization of feedback, such as their writing performance. This dearth of attention may be attributed to student feedback literacy being an “emerging concept” (Nieminen & Carless, 2022, p. 1), with current focus on identifying its construct (Yu et al., 2022; Zhang & Mao, 2023). While a handful of case investigations have probed the relationship between student feedback literacy and feedback engagement in L2 writing (e.g., Han & Xu, 2021), these findings may lack generalizability due to their restricted sample sizes, and furthermore, these studies have not delved into the realm of writing performance. Consequently, empirical research is imperative to explore the relationships between writing feedback literacy, feedback engagement, and writing performance.

Besides, we are also keen on the potential cross-linguistic interactions between L1 and L2 writing feedback literacy, that is, whether student L1 writing feedback literacy may impact their L2 writing feedback literacy. Existing research has shown that writing competence, strategies, and learner beliefs in L1 contexts can impact their counterparts in L2 settings (e.g., Cheong et al., 2019; Cummins, 2016; Zhu et al., 2022), providing a basis for positing the potential impact of L1 on L2 writing feedback literacy. This exploration is significant as it aligns with the context of students’ adaptation to a contemporary, multilingual world. Furthermore, it enriches cross-linguistic research by highlighting the interconnectedness between L1 and L2 writing, thereby fostering integration of L1 and L2 teaching practices and ultimately optimizing L2 writing pedagogy.

Writing feedback literacy, defined as an encompassing construct involving “students’ knowledge, beliefs, practice, abilities, and skills” (Yu et al., 2022, p. 3) concerning the utilization and evaluation of feedback, as well as emotional regulation during the feedback process (Yu et al., 2022). Given that this construct subsumes the previously mentioned three aspects (competence, strategies, and beliefs) that have exhibited cross-linguistic interactions across L1 and L2 learning contexts, it is plausible to hypothesize the existence of a similar phenomenon between a student’s L1 and L2 writing feedback literacies. Empirical research is imperative to substantiate this reasoning.

Hence, contextualized within the context of higher education in China, the current study primarily draws upon Yang’s (2021) feedback internalization framework and integrates Lui and Andrade’s (2022) idea of linking students’ feedback internalization to their academic achievement as the outcome of this internalization. It aims to investigate the influence of L1 student writing feedback literacy on its L2 counterpart, as well as their potential effects on L2 feedback engagement and subsequent impacts on writing performance. The study involved 231 English major sophomore students from a Chinese university, employing questionnaires to gauge feedback-related variables and a single L2 writing task for data collection. Structural equation modeling (SEM) will be employed to scrutinize the relationships among these core variables. Findings from the study can advance the current knowledge of feedback literacy and feedback engagement, extend the scholarly discourse on a cross-linguistic perspective, and offer insights into strategies for motivating students in L2 writing learning process.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Student writing feedback literacy

Inspired by the notion of academic literacy, Sutton (2012) conceptualized feedback literacy as “the ability to read, interpret and use feedback” (p. 31). Scholars have explored various facets of this concept through different theoretical lenses, including social constructivism (Carless & Boud, 2018), learner-centered perspectives (Molloy et al., 2020), socio-material perspectives (Nieminen et al., 2022), and ecological perspectives (Chong, 2021; Zhan, 2022). These theoretical perspectives offer diverse interpretations of feedback literacy. For instance, Carless and Boud (2018) identify four interrelated features of feedback literacy: appreciating feedback, making judgments, managing affect, and taking action. This aligns with the social constructivist view that knowledge is developed through dialog, sense-making, and co-construction. In contrast, Zhan (2022) adopted an ecological perspective, focusing not only on students as feedback participants but also on the contextual aspects of feedback practices. Consequently, Zhan identified contextual, engagement, and individual dimensions as integral to feedback literacy. Despite these varying conceptualizations, all perspectives agree on positioning students as active utilizers of feedback and emphasizing feedback literacy as the capacity to maximize feedback opportunities. These scholarly endeavors contribute to a nuanced understanding of the multifaceted nature of feedback literacy and its critical role in students’ feedback processing. They also guide initial explorations of feedback literacy in L2 writing education (e.g., Han & Xu, 2021; Li & Han, 2022; Zhang & Mao, 2023).

Qualitative research approaches, such as interviews, recall sessions, and analysis of essay drafts with teacher feedback, have been employed to delineate the characteristics of feedback literacy in L2 writing among focal Chinese students (Han & Xu, 2021; Li & Han, 2022). These studies conceptualize learner factors as coalescing to shape student feedback literacy, encompassing cognitive and social-affective capacities and dispositions that enable students to interact with feedback in L2 academic writing. While illuminating the features of student feedback literacy in L2 writing, there remains a need for quantitative research with larger student cohorts and reliable instruments to yield more generalizable findings. Given the nascent stage of research on student feedback literacy in L2 writing, developing an instrument to measure students’ feedback literacy in L2 writing is crucial. Reliable measurement tools are essential for delving deeper into the associations between this variable and others, thereby advancing comprehension of the potential mechanisms underlying student feedback literacy’s impact on writing.

In response to this call, Yu et al. (2022) conceptualized L2 student writing feedback literacy as the amalgamation of “students’ knowledge, beliefs, practices, abilities, and skills regarding how to appreciate, evaluate, and use L2 writing feedback and manage their emotions in this process” (Yu et al., 2022, p. 3). They established the “L2 Student Writing Feedback Literacy Scale (L2-SWFLS),” capturing five dimensions: appreciating feedback, acknowledging different feedback sources, making judgments, managing affect, and taking actions. With a sample of 1868 Chinese undergraduate students, the authors validated the reliability and validity of the scale, asserting that it “may allow writing researchers and practitioners to better understand L2 students’ beliefs and competence in evaluating and using writing feedback” (Yu et al., 2022, p. 1).

We chose to employ Yu et al.’s (2022) conceptualization of student writing feedback literacy and their corresponding L2 scale for two primary reasons. First, the scale has been rigorously validated empirically, in line with previous research that highlights the multifaceted nature of feedback literacy (e.g., Carless & Boud, 2018). Second, the scale is specifically designed for feedback processing within the context of academic writing, making it more relevant to our study than scales intended for broader educational contexts.

# 2.2. Relationship between L1 and L2 student writing feedback literacies

In the contemporary multilingual world, individuals frequently engage in the acquisition of two or even three languages. Scholars posit that proficiency in acquiring a foreign language is intertwined with a certain level of mastery in one’s mother tongue and vice versa.(e.g., Cheong et al., 2019; Cummins, 1979; Yang et al., 2017). Cummins’ (1979) linguistic interdependence hypothesis postulates a mutual reliance between L1 and L2 acquisition, asserting that competence in the native language invariably influences academic advancements in the second language. An expanding body of research substantiates positive correlations between L1 and L2 in writing competence (Cummins, 2016; Savage et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2021), writing strategies (Cheong et al., 2019; Cummins, 2016; Guo & Huang, 2020), and learners’ beliefs (Yu & Jiang, 2021; Zhu et al., 2022). For instance, Zhu et al. (2021) demonstrated positive transference of read-to-write competence among L2 writers proficient in Chinese and English. Notably, this cross-linguistic interaction extended to L1 and L2 writing performance. Furthermore, Zhu et al. (2022) identified that students’ positive self-image as accomplished L1 writers, reflecting their beliefs, contributed to their idealized images of writing in L2. These revelations provide a foundation for positing a potential interaction between L1 and L2 writing feedback literacies.

Student writing feedback literacy, an encompassing construct articulated by Yu et al. (2022), spans abilities, strategies, and beliefs in handling, utilizing, and evaluating feedback. It also addresses the regulation of affective responses to enhance writing competence. Given evidence from existing literature suggesting that students’ competence, strategies, and beliefs in L1 contexts may influence their L2 counterparts, it logically follows that students’ L1 writing feedback literacy could impact its L2 counterpart. This inference stems from the recognition that this construct encompasses elements that have demonstrated cross-linguistic interactions across L1 and L2 learning contexts. In essence, this inference is grounded in the understanding that student writing feedback literacy encapsulates transferable elements.

Furthermore, a seminal study by Yu and Liu (2021) offers partial support for this inference. By synthesizing theoretical and empirical findings, they proposed an evidence-based framework for enhancing students’ feedback literacy in academic writing. This framework highlights the critical role of knowledge repertoire and learner agency, along with their interaction with teacher- and peer-scaffolding and technical support. The authors argued that since academic writing is treated as a general term encompassing both L1 and L2, the framework could be applicable to both contexts. This finding suggests that L1 and L2 student writing feedback literacy may share commonalities, laying the foundation for literacy interaction across languages.

Therefore, two factors may support the cross-linguistic interaction of writing feedback literacy across L1 and L2: firstly, the inclusion of transferable elements within this construct, and secondly, the potential commonalities between L1 and L2 writing feedback literacy. To substantiate this potential interaction, empirical research is crucial, with a specific focus on elucidating the contributions of L1 student writing feedback literacy to its L2 counterpart.

2.3. The role of feedback engagement in the relationship between student writing feedback literacy and writing performance

It has been documented that the learning benefit reaped from feedback processes is dependent not only on students’ feedback literacy (e.g., Carless & Boud, 2018; Yu et al., 2022), but also on their feedback engagement (e.g., Winstone et al., 2019; Wood, 2021). Feedback engagement refers to how students respond to feedback (Ellis, 2010). This definition underscores its distinction from feedback literacy, as it emphasizes the active involvement of students in the feedback process, while feedback literacy focuses on students’ capacity to effectively utilize feedback. This differentiation may explain why scholars consider both as essential prerequisites for realizing the benefits of feedback.

Although feedback engagement is usually conceived as a multidimensional construct, no consensus regarding the components in the construct has been reached (e.g., Ellis, 2010; Tsao et al., 2021; Zhang & Hyland, 2022). In this study, we primarily adopt Tsao et al.’s (2021) feedback engagement construct, which involves three dimensions: cognitive (i.e., how students respond to feedback through cognitive operations), behavioral (i.e., students’ uptake of feedback and revision actions), and social (i.e., initiating engagement and being interactive in feedback).

We selected the construct for two reasons. First, the first two dimensions (i.e., cognitive and behavioral) are frequently covered in relevant research concerning engagement (e.g., Zhang & Hyland, 2022; Zheng et al., 2023). Second, since feedback is a reciprocal process wherein students provide and receive social-interactive scaffolding from others (e.g., teachers and peers) (Yu & Liu, 2021), social engagement is also a crucial component related to their engagement with feedback.

The close relationship between student feedback literacy and feedback engagement is well-documented across the broader educational landscape, highlighting the pivotal role of feedback literacy in enhancing student engagement in the feedback process (e.

g., Ajjawi et al., 2017; Carless & Boud, 2018; Noble et al., 2020). Nonetheless, research within the specific context of writing education remains relatively sparse, despite extensive investigations into the positive relationship between feedback engagement and writing performance (e.g., Tsao et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2024).

Among the limited studies addressing the nexus between student feedback literacy and feedback engagement in writing education, Han and Xu (2021) conducted a qualitative case study involving two Chinese undergraduate students. The study aimed to capture the feedback literacy profiles of the students and examine how these profiles influenced their engagement with feedback in L2 writing. The researchers found that unbalanced development of feedback literacy (e.g., positive learner beliefs but low motivation in peer interaction) would limit students’ later engagement with feedback. The study emphasized the importance of student feedback literacy in enabling effective feedback engagement in the writing classroom. The small samples, however, may not be adequate to generalize the findings.

Further, a quantitative study by Zhu et al. (2024) involving 236 undergraduates explored the potential impact of students’ writing feedback literacy on their feedback engagement. The study revealed that different dimensions of writing feedback literacy affected various aspects of feedback engagement. For instance, appreciating feedback was positively correlated with cognitive and social engagement, yet no significant association was found with behavioral engagement.

Although these studies elucidate the potential link between student feedback literacy and feedback engagement in the writing domain, they do not incorporate writing performance as an outcome variable, rendering the impact of feedback literacy on feedback engagement, especially the results of this impact, unclear. Drawing upon this research gap and considering the current research progress indicating that the potential link between feedback engagement and writing performance has been found (e.g., Jin et al., 2024), we have developed an interest in investigating how feedback engagement might mediate the relationship between student writing feedback literacy and writing performance. Examining this tripartite relationship is critical, as it provides empirical insights into how feedback-related factors influence concrete performance outcomes.

# 2.4. The present study

Thus far, we have drawn three major findings from reviewing the extant literature. First, although scholarly attention has been increasingly paid to student feedback literacy, the research on this emerging concept in both L1 and L2 writing contexts is scarce. Particularly, there is a lack of investigation to assess students’ feedback literacy in L1 writing. It is warranted to extend this line of exploration from a cross-linguistic perspective to generate a more comprehensive and robust understanding of the construct of student writing feedback literacy. Second, despite the growing recognition of the association between student feedback literacy and feedback engagement (e.g., Carless & Boud, 2018), as well as feedback engagement and writing performance (e.g., Jin et al., 2024), little is known about how students’ writing feedback literacy might affect writing performance via feedback engagement. It is crucial for teachers to fully understand the mechanism of students’ writing feedback literacy on their feedback engagement and writing performance, such that effective interventions can be implemented to help students optimize the benefits of feedback. Third, existing research on student writing feedback literacy mainly relies on qualitative research methods and involves a small sample of participants. Yu et al. (2022) established a valid scale (the L2-SWFLS) to measure student writing feedback literacy, which provides a useful instrument for large-scale quantitative analysis.

Given this, the current study concentrates on the relationships among L1 and L2 student writing feedback literacies, L2 feedback

# Learning opportunities in the writing context

engagement, and L2 writing performance. To illustrate the potential links among these variables, we drew upon Yang’s (2021) ecological feedback framework to establish a hypothesized model (see Fig. 1).

As noted by Yang (2021), the internalization of external feedback into learning opportunities necessitates students’ active processing and engagement with feedback. Therefore, building upon our literature review, we hypothesized that students’ writing feedback literacy, which forms the foundation of their feedback processing, will influence their subsequent engagement with feedback.

Furthermore, we consider the academic achievement emphasized by Lui and Andrade (2022) to be pivotal in witnessing the outcomes of students’ internalization of feedback. Lui and Andrade (2022) provided evidence demonstrating a direct link between students’ responses to feedback and their academic achievement. Based on this, we posited that students’ writing performance should be included in the model and connected with their feedback engagement. This inclusion is crucial to capture the extent to which students’ writing feedback literacy, pertaining to their feedback processing, is linked with students’ feedback engagement and how this relationship may further impact their writing performance. It is noteworthy that, to the best of our knowledge, since there is no existing literature demonstrating a potential direct association between students’ writing feedback literacy and their writing performance, we did not include a line representing this association in the hypothesized model. This approach aligns with the current trend in the literature, which acknowledges, on one hand, the essential role of students’ ability to process feedback for enhanced writing performance, and on the other hand, the recognition that students must actively engage in feedback processing and utilize feedback to truly impact their writing (e.g., Lu et al., 2023; Wu & Schunn, 2021).

Therefore, the following research questions guided this study: RQ1: How does students’ L1 writing feedback literacy predict their L2 writing feedback literacy? RQ2: How do L1 and L2 writing feedback literacies impact L2 writing performance via L2 feedback engagement?

# 3.1. Contexts and participants

A total of 231 sophomore English majors $( 8 9 . 2 \%$ female) with a mean age of 20.16 years $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { S D } = . 7 9 $ ) were recruited from a university in southern mainland China. This university, designated as a “Double First-Class” institution by the Chinese Ministry of Education in 2017, is committed to the development of a world-class university with distinctive Chinese characteristics. The humanities and social sciences programs, including education and linguistics, are considered to be above average in quality at this institution. The typical career paths for undergraduate English majors include roles such as English teachers at primary or secondary schools, translators for enterprises or government agencies, and positions in international trade-related fields.

All students were L1 Chinese native speakers. They achieved a mean score of 123.74 $\mathrm { \bf { S D } } = 9 . 7 9 $ ) out of 150 on the Chinese test of the national College Entrance Examination, indicating a high intermediate or above level of general Chinese proficiency. On average, students had 10.4 years of English learning experience $( \mathrm { S D } = 1 . 6 6 ) $ ), and obtained a mean score of 119.61 $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { \left. X D = 7 . 6 8 \right. }$ ) out of 150 on the English test of the national College Entrance Examination, also indicating a high intermediate or above level of general English proficiency.

The students were required to study Chinese language throughout the academic year, and attended 16 sessions per semester, each lasting $9 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ , to improve their reading and writing abilities. In addition, these students were enrolled in an English composition program, which consisted of 16 different courses per semester, each lasting $9 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ . Notably, the writing courses included both independent writing tasks and integrated writing tasks, covering various types of writing, such as argumentative essays. The aim was to familiarize students with diverse writing types and enhance their ability to apply language skills across different types of writing assignments.

In fact, requiring students to simultaneously study Chinese and English within a semester serves not only to adapt to the current multilingual world, which demands proficiency in at least two languages, but also, more importantly, to leverage the learning of Chinese as a first language to facilitate the acquisition of English as a second language. Existing research has revealed that acquiring a foreign language is linked to a certain level of proficiency in one’s native tongue (e.g., Cheong et al., 2019; Perkins & Zhang, 2024). Extensive research demonstrates a positive correlation between proficiency in reading and writing competence in the first language (L1) and its counterpart in the second language (L2) (e.g., Van den Bosch et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2021). Therefore, by assisting students in enhancing their reading and writing abilities in Chinese, there is a potential to concurrently improve their reading and writing abilities in English.

Prior to the research, all participants signed the consent form, indicating that they agreed to participate in the study voluntarily and without compensation. Procedures for the study were approved by the University Research Ethics Board (Institutional Review Board).

# 3.2. Instruments

The questionnaire. The questionnaire measured students’ L1 and L2 writing feedback literacies and feedback engagement on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). As all participants in this study were native Chinese speakers, the English items underwent translation into Chinese and subsequent back-translation into English with the assistance of a bilingualism expert with ten years of experience teaching bilingual reading and writing courses. This expert’s role was crucial to ensure the preservation of all information during the translation process.

To further guarantee that the translated Chinese items were accurately understood by Chinese students, after the initial translation of English items into Chinese by the expert, we conducted a cultural adaptation of the items. Specifically, we enlisted the assistance of five sophomore English majors whose native language is Chinese. While these students did not participate in the formal questionnaire survey, they agreed to contribute to the questionnaire development process after being briefed on the study’s objectives. These students were tasked with reading the translated Chinese items and providing feedback, indicating areas where the expressions were unclear. Based on their feedback, we further refined the questionnaire’s wording.

Following that, participants were required to complete the questionnaire in Chinese. The reliability of the questionnaire was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha, and its construct validity was subsequently examined through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).

The L2 student writing feedback literacy scale, adopted from Yu et al. (2022), included 28 items to ask students’ L2 writing feedback literacy in appreciating feedback (ten items), acknowledging different feedback sources (five items), making judgments (five items), managing affect (three items), and taking action (five items). Notably, Yu et al. (2022) initially deconstructed these dimensions from Carless and Boud (2018) and Molloy et al. (2020) into 56 independent items to ensure clarity and prevent unintended interpretations. Despite the varying item counts across dimensions, each dimension aligned with the foundational requirements of scale development, ensuring a minimum of four items per sub-scale. Following an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and subsequent Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) based on the EFA results, Yu et al. (2022) finalized the scale, comprising 28 items assessing the five dimensions.

Based on Yu et al.’s (2022) work, we developed a parallel scale for L1 student writing feedback literacy, following the approach outlined by Amrhein and Nassaji (2010). Amrhein and Nassaji (2010) compared students’ and teachers’ perceptions of the usefulness of different types and amounts of written corrective feedback by designing a single questionnaire for students and then modifying the instructions and wording to adapt it for teachers. Similarly, Zhu et al. (2022) employed this approach to measure students’ ideal L1 and L2 writing selves. Authors used CFA to test the construct validity of ideal L1 and L2 writing selves separately and tested an alternative model with items loading onto the same factor. The results indicated significant differences, demonstrating that loading ideal L1 and L2 writing selves items onto the same factor significantly altered model-data fit, confirming that these two variables had distinct constructs.

Given that the study also uses scales to measure variables, we adopted this approach to create parallel scales for students’ writing feedback literacy in both L1 and L2 contexts. Specifically, following Amrhein and Nassaji (2010), we adjusted the wording of items based on feedback from students involved in the questionnaire development process to ensure suitability for the L1 Chinese writing context. Additionally, following Zhu et al. (2022), we conducted CFA for both the L1 and L2 student writing feedback literacy scales to validate their construct validity.

The L2 feedback engagement scale was developed based on Tsao et al. (2021), which measured students’ L2 feedback engagement in three dimensions: cognitive, behavioral, and social engagement. Recognizing the potential impact on scale reliability posed by a limited number of items (i.e., less than three) assigned to each dimension (Kopalle & Lehmann, 1997), we introduced new items to enhance dimension representation. For the cognitive dimension, one additional item was developed: “Upon receiving written corrective feedback (e.g., teachers and peers), I evaluate whether it was appropriate to use in my revision and what extra revisions I need to make to improve my English writing.” For the behavioral dimension, two new items were created, such as “I use the written corrective feedback (e.g., teachers and students) into my revision.” The social dimension incorporated one additional item: “I consult my classmates or teachers’ suggestions when I revise my English writing.”

These additions were inspired by the operationalizations of cognitive and behavioral engagement dimensions by Zhang and Hyland (2022) and the operationalization of social engagement by Tsao et al. (2021) in their respective research endeavors. With the guidance of the expert specializing in the mechanisms of feedback on writing, we referenced the studies by Zhang and Hyland (2022) and Tsao et al. (2021), initially clarifying the operational definitions of each dimension included in feedback engagement. This process ensured that each definition encapsulated a description of the key characteristics of each dimension, and that these characteristics collectively formed a comprehensive and coherent understanding of feedback engagement.

Cognitive engagement pertains to how students respond to feedback through revision operations and the utilization of cognitive strategies. Behavioral engagement concerns the actions taken during revision and the time allocated to revision activities. Social engagement refers to the extent of interaction students have with others during the feedback process. Subsequently, we proceeded to decompose these definitions into specific items. For example, in the operationalization of cognitive engagement, we identified the key elements: revision operations and strategy use. These elements were then integrated into coherent statements, such as “I evaluate (i.e., strategy use) whether it was appropriate to use in my revision and what extra revisions (i.e., revision operation) I need to make to improve my English writing.”

To further ensure the reliability and validity of the scale, we conducted pilot testing with 10 sophomore English majors whose native language is Chinese. These participants were not involved in the scale development process or the formal investigation of this study. Based on their feedback, we adjusted the wording of certain items to enhance clarity. In total, nine items, comprising three items per dimension, were included in the assessment of students’ L2 feedback engagement.

The L2 English writing task. The L2 English writing task was designed to assess students’ L2 writing performance. Particularly, it was an integrated writing (IW) task which asked students to write an essay based on various source materials. There are three reasons for selecting IW as the writing task. First, IW has been frequently employed in several large-scale language assessment systems, such as the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), as well as a variety of school-based language assessment programs (e.g., Cheong et al., 2019; Zhu et al., 2021, 2022). Second, the composing processes where students draw information from the source article help develop discourse synthesis skill, a fundamental competence required in academic writing (Numrich & Kennedy, 2017). Third, students were familiar with this kind of writing task as it was one of the regular learning activities in their course.

We developed the writing task based on the Four Traits of Integrated Writing Competence established by Zhu (2015), Zhu et al. (2016). The task topic, “Traditional Learning and Online Learning,” was selected to reflect participants’ lived experiences with online learning during the Covid-19 pandemic. In addition, this topic provides an opportunity for students to apply their language skills in discussing contemporary educational issues, which are pertinent to their academic and professional development. Four English reading materials presenting varied viewpoints were sourced from multiple origins: (a) a newspaper article discussing the current state and asserting that online learning has emerged as an unstoppable educational trend; (b) a newspaper article presenting a conflicting view that while online learning fosters student autonomy, it also risks making students lazier without teacher supervision; (c) an academic paper providing an overview of the current state of traditional learning; and (d) a school textbook essay on conducting traditional and online learning at the university level.

Participants were instructed to compose an argumentative essay of approximately 200 words based on the assigned reading materials. The task’s content and difficulty level were rechecked and validated by two English writing course instructors and an expert in language assessment.

The scoring rubrics for the four traits of the writing task were adapted from Zhu (2015): (1) contextual awareness, (2) citation and synthesis, (3) opinion and argument, and (4) organization and expression. These rubrics have been utilized in prior empirical studies, such as Cheong et al. (2019), Yao et al. (2023), and Zhu et al. (2016), and have demonstrated acceptable validity. Each trait was further divided into five descriptive scales specifying typical strengths and weaknesses in writing, with each level ranging across two marks. The task was scored out of 40 total points, with the highest possible score for each trait being 10 and the lowest being 0.

# 3.3. Data collection

The writing task and questionnaire were administered to the participants in the classroom setting by their classroom teachers, specifically at the conclusion of the autumn semester. Students first completed the L2 English writing task in $6 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ . After a 10-minute break, they answered the questionnaire on L2 student writing feedback literacy scale and L2 feedback engagement scales in $3 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ . The order of the items within the questionnaire was randomized. Two weeks later, students dedicated $2 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ to respond to the L1 student writing feedback literacy scale, with the order of items once again randomized.

This design served two purposes. First, completing the L2-related task consecutively ensured that students remained consciously engaged in the L2 context, thereby reflecting their genuine thoughts in the L2 questionnaires. Second, this approach prevented their responses to the L1 questionnaire from being influenced by their recent engagement with L2 assignments. The clear temporal separation between L2 and L1 assessments aimed to provide distinct and independent measures of feedback literacy in both languages. Randomizing sequence of items within the questionnaires also helped to differentiate the L1 questionnaire from their previous engagement.

Two experienced raters with master’s degrees provided analytic ratings on students’ writings based on the scoring rubrics. Two group training were organized before formal scoring to familiarize raters with the writing task and scoring rubrics. Different levels of anchor essays were supplied for discussion and trail marking. After assessing the initial 30 essays, an additional meeting was held to resolve any uncertainties and conflicts between the raters, after which the remaining essays were examined. Once all essays were graded, a third marker reviewed and made adjustments to those with a score difference of 5 or more.The inter-rater reliability of the total score was 0.93 $( p < . 0 1 )$ ). The averaged summed scores assigned by the two raters were used to indicate the students’ L2 writing performance.

# 3.4. Data analysis

SPSS version 25.0 (IBM Corp, 2017) was employed for preliminary analyses, including descriptive statistics, Cronbach’s alpha, and bivariate correlations for the primary variables. The SPSS-compatible Amos 25.0 (Arbuckle, 2017) was then used to conduct subsequent analyses. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to examine the construct validity of the questionnaire. Average Variance Extracted (AVE) and Composite Reliability (CR) were calculated to evaluate the degree to which the indicators converge on a single factor, focusing on item factor loadings and their statistical significance. Convergent validity, a critical indicator of construct validity, is established when the AVE value exceeds 0.5 and the CR value is greater than the AVE, indicating that the latent factor is well-explained by its observed variables (Hair et al., 2010). It is also important to note, as Fornell and Larcker (1981) suggested, that convergent validity may still be considered adequate if AVE is less than 0.5 but CR exceeds 0.6.

Specifically, the items for L1 student writing feedback literacy, L2 student writing feedback literacy, and L2 feedback engagement were loaded onto their corresponding dimensions. To rule out the potential merging of L1 and L2 student writing feedback literacies as a single construct, an alternative model was examined. This model involved assessing whether items related to L1 and L2 student writing feedback literacies could be loaded onto the same factor for each of the five dimensions.

Next, we executed structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate the mechanisms of students’ writing feedback literacy on feedback engagement, and writing performance. Specifically, L1 and L2 student writing feedback literacies were treated as the exogenous variables and L2 writing performance the endogenous variable, with L2 feedback engagement as the mediator. The original scales included 65 items $( 2 8 + 2 8 + 9 )$ . However, our sample size was only 231. The ratio of sample size to item number was did not meet the commonly used 10–1 level. Therefore, we calculated the means of each dimension of the feedback writing literacy and feedback engagement scales, and used the mean scores to measure the latent variables. For example, we used the mean scores of the five dimensions of L1 writing feedback literacy to measure the latent variable. Maximum likelihood estimators were employed for all analyses. Several fit indices were employed to examine the model data fit, including chi-square-based goodness-of-fit indices (χ2 and $\chi 2 / \mathrm { d f } )$ , comparative fit index (CFI; acceptable $> 0 . 9 0 \dot { }$ ), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA; good $< 0 . 0 6$ , acceptable $<$ 0.08), and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR; acceptable $< 0 . 0 8$ ) (Hu & Bentler, 1999). In addition, a bootstrapping approach was utilized with 2000 samples to investigate the mediating effect of L2 feedback engagement in the model, and $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals (CIs) excluding zero suggested a significant mediation effect (MacKinnon et al., 2004).

# 4. Results

Descriptive statistics, Cronbach’s alpha, and bivariate correlations between the primary variables are shown in Table 1. All kurtosis and skewedness values were below $\pm 3$ , indicating normal distributions of the variables (Meyers et al., 2016). Cronbach’s alpha coefficients of the subdimensions of L1 and L2 student writing feedback literacies and L2 feedback engagement met the required cutoff of 0.70 for linguistic research (Dornyei, ¨ 2007). Positive associations existed among most sub-dimensions of L1 and L2 writing feedback literacies and L2 feedback engagement. L2 writing performance, however, only positively correlated with feedback cognitive and social engagement, as well as the first two dimensions of L1 writing feedback literacy.

# 4.1. CFA results

To examine the construct validity of the questionnaire, four CFA models were created. Fig. 2 showed the five-factor L1 student writing feedback literacy model with standardized regression weights. The results indicated that this model was an acceptable fit for the data: χ2 $\colon ( 3 3 7 ) = 5 7 8 . 9 1 4$ , $\chi 2 / \mathrm { d f } = 1 . 7 1 8$ , $\mathrm { C F I } = 0 . 9 1 4$ , RMSEA $[ 9 0 \% \ \mathrm { C I } ] = 0 . 0 5 6$ [0.048, 0.063], and $\mathbf { S R M R } = 0 . 0 5 1$ . The standardized estimated loadings ranged from.48 to.87 at $p < . 0 0 1$ level. The five dimensions of L1 student writing feedback literacy positively associated with each other. The AVE values for the five dimensions ranged from 0.448 to 0.507, and the CR values ranged from 0.712 to 0.903. Although the AVE values for appreciating feedback, acknowledging different feedback sources, managing affect, and taking action were slightly below 0.5 (0.482, 0.448, 0.456, and 0.477, respectively), their convergent validity remains acceptable as their CR values exceeded 0.6 (0.903, 0.802, 0.712, and 0.783, respectively), in line with Fornell and Larcker’ s (1981) criteria.

Fig. 3 presented the five-factor L2 student writing feedback literacy model with standardized regression weights. The results indicated the model also reached acceptable level fit to data: $( 2 ~ ( 3 3 7 ) = 5 7 3 . 7 8 0$ , $\chi 2 / \mathrm { d f } = 1 . 7 0 3$ , $\mathrm { C F I } = 0 . 9 0 6$ , RMSEA $[ 9 0 \%$ CI] $= 0 . 0 5 5$ [0.047, 0.063], and $\mathsf { S R M R } = 0 . 0 5 9$ . The standardized estimated loadings ranged from.52 to.80 at $ { \mathbf { p } } < . 0 0 1$ level, and the five dimensions positively associated with each other. The AVE values for the five dimensions ranged from 0.355 to 0.528, while the CR values ranged from 0.732 to 0.892. Although the AVE values for appreciating feedback, acknowledging different feedback sources, making judgments, and taking action were slightly below the 0.5 threshold (0.457, 0.355, 0.413, and 0.415, respectively), their convergent validity is deemed acceptable. This is supported by their CR values, which exceeded the 0.6 threshold (0.892, 0.732, 0.777, and 0.778, respectively), consistent with the criteria set forth by Fornell and Larcker (1981).

An alternative model was also examined with L1 and L2 student writing feedback literacies items loading onto the same factors for the five dimensions. The results indicated that the model did not fit the data $( \chi 2 ~ ( 1 4 7 4 ) = 3 3 8 0 . 7 3 4$ , $\chi 2 / \mathrm { d f } = 2 . 2 9 4$ , $\mathrm { C F I } = 0 . 6 6 6$ , RMSEA $[ 9 0 \% \ \mathrm { C I } ] = 0 . 0 7 5$ [0.072, 0.078], and $\mathbf { S R M R } = 0 . 0 8 6$ ). Additionally, there was a significant difference in the Chi-squared values between the L1 student writing feedback literacy and this alternative model $( \Delta \chi 2 ~ ( 1 1 3 7 ) = 2 8 0 1 . 8 2 $ , $\mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 )$ , as well as the L2 student writing feedback literacy and this alternative model $( \Delta \chi 2 \ ( 1 1 3 7 ) = 2 8 0 6 . 9 5 $ , $\mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1 )$ ). This suggested that loading L1 and L2 student writing feedback literacies items onto the same factors significantly changed model-data fit. In other words, L1 and L2 student feedback literacies indeed had different constructs.

We then examined the three-factor L2 feedback engagement model with standardized regression weights (Fig. 4). The results indicated the model fit the data well: $\chi 2 \left( 2 4 \right) = 5 1 . 7 5 7$ , $\chi 2 / \mathrm { d f } = 2 . 1 5 7$ , $\mathrm { C F I } = 0 . 9 5 2 $ , RMSEA $[ 9 0 \% \mathrm { C I } ] = 0 . 0 7 1$ [0.044, 0.098], and $\mathbf { S R M R } = 0 . 0 5 6$ . The standardized estimated loadings ranged from.51 to.80 at $\mathbf { p } < . 0 0 1$ level, and the three kinds of engagements positively related to each other. However, it is important to note that the RMSEA value is close to the upper limit of what is typically considered a good fit (0.07), and the upper limit of the confidence interval is near the threshold for a poor fit. This suggests that while the model is acceptable, there may be room for improvement in its specification.

The AVE values for cognitive, behavioral, and social engagement were 0.452, 0.540, and 0.447, respectively. The CR values for these constructs were 0.707, 0.777, and 0.707. Despite the AVE values for cognitive and social engagement being slightly below the 0.5 threshold (0.452 and 0.447), their convergent validity remains acceptable. This is due to their CR values exceeding the 0.6 threshold (0.707 and 0.707), in line with Fornell and Larcker’ s (1981) criteria.

In sum, these results provided confirmation of the construct validity of L1 and L2 student writing feedback literacies, as well as L2 feedback engagement, among Chinese university L2 writers.

# 4.2. SEM results

Subsequently, we investigated the relationships between students’ L1 and L2 writing feedback literacies, L2 feedback engagement, and L2 writing performance. Fig. 5 showed the standardized path coefficients estimates for the SEM model which reached acceptable level fit to the data: $( \chi 2 \left( 7 4 \right) = 1 5 2 . 3 8 8$ , $\chi 2 / \mathrm { d f } = 2 . 0 5 9$ , $\mathrm { C F I } = 0 . 9 3 3$ , RMSEA $[ 9 0 \% \mathrm { C I } ] = 0 . 0 6 8$ [0.052, 0.083], and SRMR $= 0 5 6$ . The squared multiple correlations of L2 writing feedback literacy, L2 feedback engagement, and L2 writing performance were 0.489, 0.436, and 0.041 ( $\mathrm { I I } p s < 0 . 0 5$ ), respectively. This indicated that our model accounted for $4 8 . 9 \%$ , $4 3 . 6 \%$ , and $4 . 1 \%$ of the variance in these three variables.

L1 student writing feedback literacy exerted a strong direct positive effect on L2 student writing feedback literacy $( \beta = 0 . 7 0$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ ). We also observed direct effects from L2 student writing feedback literacy to L2 feedback engagement $\textstyle \mathcal { B } = 0 . 5 8$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1 $ and from L2 feedback engagement to L2 writing performance $\beta = 0 . 2 0$ , $p < 0 . 0 1$ ).

This indicated that students’ L1 and L2 writing feedback literacies were an essential mechanism leading to their L2 feedback engagement, which, in turn, influenced L2 writing performance.

writing performance. The major findings are discussed below.

# 5.1. Relationship of L1 and L2 student writing feedback literacies

Regarding RQ1, the SEM results demonstrated that students’ L1 writing feedback literacy influenced their L2 writing feedback literacy. This result aligns with existing research emphasizing the positive impact of L1 writing competence, writing strategies, and learners’ beliefs on their corresponding L2 skills (e.g., Cheong et al., 2019; Cummins, 2016; Zhu et al., 2021, 2022). More importantly, it advances this line of inquiry by demonstrating that the cross-linguistic interaction extends to writing feedback literacy—a comprehensive amalgamation of knowledge, skills, strategies, and beliefs governing the productive utilization of feedback for writing development.

In other words, students’ L2 writing feedback literacy can be built upon the developmental of their L1 writing feedback literacy. Indeed, this cross-linguistic interaction commonly transpires when there is a foundation of well-established L1 skills (Cummins, 1979, 2016). Given that the participants were all native Chinese speakers, they could engage in feedback practices more comfortably in their L1, such as providing comments and asking for explanations during feedback processes (e.g., Hyland & Hyland, 2006; Yu & Lee, 2014, 2015). Therefore, they are more likely to develop their L1 writing feedback literacy through frequent L1 use in feedback practices, laying the groundwork for the potential transfer of writing feedback literacy from L1 to L2.

Furthermore, Cummins (2016) posits a “common underlying proficiency construct” between L1 and L2, which facilitates the “possible transfer of concepts, skills, and learning strategies across languages” (p. 940). This may also explain why the cross-linguistic interaction exists between students’ L1 and L2 writing feedback literacy. Specifically, transitioning from an L1 to an L2 context does not substantially alter the feedback processes of providing, receiving, and reviewing feedback (Yu & Liu, 2021). There are common skills necessary for feedback processes in both L1 and L2, making skill transfer across languages feasible. Consequently, the feedback literacy developed in L1 practices can support the development of feedback literacy in L2.

Appre_feedback $=$ Appreciating feedback; Acknow_source $=$ Acknowledging different feedback sources; Makin_jugem $=$ Making judgments; Manag_affect $=$ Managing affect; Taking_action $=$ Taking Action.

Additionally, the positive effect of students’ L1 writing feedback literacy on its L2 counterpart, to some extent, enhances comprehension of argument that encourages L1 use in feedback practices of L2 writing (e.g., Yu & Lee, 2014; Yu & Hu, 2017; Zhao, 2010) from a literacy-transfer perspective. For example, Yu and Hu (2017) examined two Chinese undergraduate students’ peer feedback practices in L2 writing. The results showed that students valued the feedback written in L1 and regarded it as detailed and constructive for enhancing their writing. Therefore, it is plausible that L1 use in L2 writing feedback practices might enhance students’ writing feedback literacy, such as appreciating feedback, in both L1 and L2. More research is warranted to further explore this interesting issue.

5.2. The mediating role of L2 feedback engagement in the relationship between student writing feedback literacies and L2 writing performance

Regarding RQ2, the SEM results suggested that L2 student writing feedback literacy could function in tandem with L2 feedback engagement to exert a dual-stage mediating effect on L2 writing performance. Specifically, L1 student writing feedback literacy was found to positively impact L2 student writing feedback literacy, which, in turn, encouraged students to engage with L2 feedback, ultimately enhancing their L2 performance. This finding partially aligns with Zhu et al. (2024) and Han and Xu (2021), who also identified a close relationship between students’ writing feedback literacy and their feedback engagement.Notably, Authors (2024) focused on L1 contexts, whereas Han and Xu (2021) investigated L2 contexts.In addition, the finding supports our hypothesized model, drawing upon Yang (2021) and Lui and Andrade (2022), illustrating the potential link between the internalization of feedback and its outcome (i.e., writing performance). Furthermore, it reveals the process of feedback internalization, where students’ writing feedback literacy influences their feedback engagement from a cross-linguistic perspective.

Considering the insignificant mediating effect of L2 feedback engagement alone in the relationship between L1 writing feedback literacy and L2 writing performance, it appears that L2 writing feedback literacy plays a pivotal role in amplifying the influence of L1 writing feedback literacy on L2 feedback engagement and, subsequently, on L2 writing performance. A plausible explanation is that feedback is a contextualized activity (Carless, 2016), implying that the feedback literacy necessary for effective engagement must also be specific to the context. In other words, in an L2 context, the effectiveness of students’ L2 feedback engagement primarily depends on their levels of L2 writing feedback literacy rather than their L1 counterpart.

Combined with the finding that L1 student writing feedback literacy positively impacts its L2 counterpart, it suggests that these two forms of writing feedback literacy play different roles within the overall feedback mechanism. Specifically, students’ writing feedback literacy in L1 contributes to their development of writing feedback literacy in L2. Meanwhile, L2 writing feedback literacy facilitates feedback engagement, enabling deeper involvement and more effective responses to feedback, which further enhances their L2 writing performance.

In addition, regarding the weak direct effect of L2 feedback engagement on L2 writing performance $( \beta = 0 . 2 0 )$ , we posit that other factors specific to L2 writing, such as students’ ideal L2 self, L2 writing enjoyment, and L2 writing engagement, may also play a role in shaping the relationship between feedback engagement and writing performance (e.g., Zhou & Hiver, 2022; Zhu et al., 2022). These variables may more directly reflect students’ cognitive, affective, and behavioral states during writing, thus potentially exerting a more immediate influence on writing performance. Future research could attempt to involve these variables to explore the effect of L2 feedback engagement on writing.

# 5.3. Theoretical implications

This study contributes to the literature in three ways. First, it provides compelling evidence for the construct validity of the L1 student writing feedback literacy scale. This not only advances the pioneering work of Yu et al. (2022) in L2 writing, but also deepens the understanding of the multifaceted nature of student writing feedback literacy.

Second, building upon Yang’s (2021) ecological feedback framework, this study enriches the comprehension of the internalization of external feedback into learning opportunities. On one hand, by incorporating a cross-linguistic perspective, we reveal how students’ L1 and L2 writing feedback literacy, which pertains to their feedback processing, are linked with students’ L2 feedback engagement. This deepens the understanding of how feedback processing and engagement collectively form learning opportunities. On the other hand, drawing from Lui and Andrade’s (2022) perspective of considering academic achievement as an output of feedback internalization, we demonstrate the positive mediation of students’ feedback engagement, reflecting their response to feedback, on the relationship between students’ writing feedback literacy and their writing performance. This further develops Yang’s (2021) framework by bridging the internalization of external feedback with the outcomes of this internalization, thus illustrating the mechanisms of feedback on writing. This also expands upon the existing literature on the relationships between student feedback literacy and feedback engagement (e.g., Han & Xu, 2021; Zhu et al., 2024) and between feedback engagement and writing performance (e.g., Jin et al., 2024).

Third, the study demonstrates the influence of L1 student writing feedback literacy on its L2 counterpart and their positive impacts on L2 writing learning. Such empirical evidence not only enriches cross-linguistic research by illuminating the interconnectedness between L1 and L2 writing but also serves as a catalyst for integrating L1 and L2 teaching practices. Furthermore, it facilitates the exploration of potential cross-linguistic interactions involving knowledge, strategies, skills, and beliefs between the two languages, ultimately optimizing L2 writing pedagogy.

# 5.4. Pedagogical implications

The research findings offer some pedagogical insights. First, given the significant contribution of L2 student writing feedback literacy to L2 feedback engagement and L2 writing performance, teachers can employ certain strategies to support students to develop their writing feedback literacy in L2 learning. To be specific, they can orchestrate the L2 writing course to provide feedback training, multi-source feedback practice (e.g., teachers and peers), and post-feedback reinforcement (e.g., reflection on feedback) (e.g., Malecka et al., 2022; Zhang & Mao, 2023). By implementing these strategies consistently, students can benefit from frequent exposure to feedback opportunities, fostering sustained development of their writing feedback literacy.

For instance, Zhang and Mao (2023) conducted a study over a 16-week semester to explore student feedback literacy development in an L2 writing classroom. They integrated pedagogical approaches that included the aforementioned strategies: feedback training, multiple-source feedback activities, and post-feedback reinforcement. Through comparative analysis of pre- and post-study questionnaires and interviews, they observed enhanced feedback literacy among students. Notably, students exhibited improved skills in eliciting feedback, making judgments, and appreciating feedback. These findings underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of consistently implementing such strategies in the writing classroom.

Second, considering the positive effect of L1 student writing feedback literacy on its L2 counterpart, it is encouraged for L1 and L2 teachers to collaborate in the design of the writing curriculum. This collaborative effort entails the creation of writing tasks and the selection of topics that emphasize the development of literacy skills in both L1 and L2 writing. For instance, teachers could design an assignment where students initially compose an essay in their L1 addressing educational contexts or topics that prompt reflection on their language learning experience. Students would participate in providing and receiving feedback from teachers and/or peers, revising their work, and reflecting on the strategies used when incorporating feedback. Subsequently, students would write a related essay in their L2, with teachers encouraging them to apply the feedback strategies learned from their L1 writing. By doing so, students can establish a connection between their L1 and L2 writing feedback literacies and explicitly reference their L1 writing feedback literacy in their L2 writing learning. This approach allows students to leverage the knowledge and skills they have already acquired in L1 to effectively engage in feedback practices within the context of L2 writing.

Third, given the mediating role of L2 feedback engagement in the relationship between students’ writing feedback literacies and L2 writing performance, teachers are encouraged to motivate students to devote time and effort to their feedback processes and to use strategies to regulate the processes (Han & Xu, 2021). Specifically, teachers should provide targeted encouragement and support to students whose lower L2 proficiency may hinder their feedback engagement. Teachers can encourage these students to communicate more in L2 during feedback practices, reassuring them that mistakes are part of the learning process and can enhance their engagement. Additionally, teachers can provide support by teaching common feedback strategies or offering templates for feedback, such as: “Your essay is strong in [specific aspect], but it could be improved in [specific area] by [specific suggestion].”

Furthermore, to increase students’ close interaction with feedback, teachers are also encouraged to create an inclusive and cooperative learning environment that can foster good rapport between peers and students as well as between the teacher and students (Han & Xu, 2021; Zhang & Hyland, 2022). All these measures, taken together, can facilitate students to actively engage in L2 writing learning.

# 6. Conclusions

Taking a cross-linguistic perspective, we investigated the influence of L1 student writing feedback literacy on its L2 counterpart, alongside their impacts on L2 feedback engagement and L2 writing performance. The study revealed two major findings: firstly, L2 feedback engagement was identified as a mediator linking students’ writing feedback literacies in both L1 and L2 to their L2 writing performance. Secondly, a positive association was observed between L1 student writing feedback literacy and its L2 counterpart, highlighting the existence of cross-linguistic interaction across L1 and L2 in student writing feedback literacy.

While the study yields valuable insights, it is crucial to address several limitations that warrant acknowledgment. First, the study only involved English-major students from one Chinese university. Caution should be taken when generalizing the findings to other educational or cultural contexts, as variations in these contexts may influence the cross-linguistic interactions between L1 and L2 skills (e.g., Uysal, 2012). Future research should aim to collect data from a more diverse range of participants and investigate the replicability of the findings across various educational and cultural settings. For instance, it would be valuable to explore whether the crosslinguistic interaction of writing feedback literacy persists among secondary school students or when the languages involved are different, such as Chinese and Japanese. Answers to these inquiries can enrich our understanding of feedback literacy and its significance in L2 writing education.

Second, the study primarily relied on the data from self-reported survey responses from students, which introduces the potential for single-measure bias and may impact the results. Future research may complement with more qualitative data, such as semi-structured interviews and classroom observations, to further delve into the factors influencing the interaction of writing feedback literacies between the two languages, as well as the mental processes in feedback engagement.

Third, SEM typically benefits from a sizable sample size to thoroughly examine the proposed theoretical model and evaluate its model fit. While we attempted to meet the data requirements for SEM by computing the means of each dimension of every variable in the study, this approach carries the risk of oversimplifying item information. Therefore, future research endeavors may consider enlarging the sample size to ensure the study’s validity.

Additionally, researchers could focus on 1–2 variables to delve deeper into the relationships among different dimensions of these variables. For example, based on the results of the correlation analysis, the behavioral dimension of feedback engagement did not correlate with students’ writing performance, whereas the social dimension did. This implies that different dimensions of feedback engagement may play different roles in promoting students’ writing progress. Future research could further explore the relationships among these variable dimensions, thus providing more detailed recommendations to assist students in improving their writing skills.

# Feedback engagement.

Behavioral dimension.

1. Upon receiving the written corrective feedback (e.g., teachers and students), I spend time revising my writing based on it. 2. Upon receiving the written corrective feedback (e.g., teachers and students), I work hard to revise my writing in order to improve the quality of the composition. 3. I use the written corrective feedback (e.g., teachers and students) into my revision. Social dimension. 1. I discuss with my classmates about the content of the written corrective feedback (e.g., teachers and students). 2. I double-check with my English teacher about the content of the written corrective feedback (e.g., teachers and students). 3. I consult my classmates or teachers’ suggestions when I revise my English writing. Cognitive dimension. 1. Upon receiving the written corrective feedback (e.g., teachers and students), I think about the errors I made before starting to revise my English writing. 2. I keep the written corrective feedback (e.g., teachers and students) in my mind in order not to make the same mistakes again. 3. Upon receiving the written corrective feedback (e.g., teachers and students), I evaluate whether it was appropriate to use in my revision and what extra revisions I need to make to improve my English writing.
