# 100 tips to avoid mistakes in academic writing and presenting, Adrian Wallwork, Anna Southern. Springer (2020). p. 156 $^ +$ xiv, Pbk., ISBN: 978-3-030-44213-2

Achieving a satisfactory standard of academic writing is a crucially important requirement for students and researchers to achieve success; however, it presents a considerable number of difficulties for most if not all novice writers. To help overcome these difficulties, Adrian Wallwork has written a series of practical writing guides (e.g. English for Writing Research Papers (2011); English for Research: Usage, Style, and Grammar (2013), the most recent of which is 100 Tips to Avoid Mistakes in Academic Writing and Presenting. As the title indicates, this book sets out one hundred common mistakes in academic writing and presenting and suggests how they might be avoided. Instead of simply providing general guidelines, Wallwork and Southern focus on the most typical mistakes they have encountered in thirty years of editing scientific research papers, with the aim of helping academic writers understand which mistakes can have a major impact on reviewers and determine the fate of their papers. While most writing manuals focus on grammar and vocabulary, this book is based on the premise that readability needs to be the main priority for writers. The authors therefore encourage writers to approach their work from the perspective of readers and suggest ways of achieving this goal. In this, they concur with scholars (e.g., Hyland, 2005) who maintain that reader awareness is a late-developing but essential skill for novice writers. The book addresses some relatively neglected but important academic genres such as project proposals, emails, and presentations. The breadth of its coverage and practical nature of its content make this a very useful guide for new academic writers, EAP teachers, and graduate students.

The book’s nine chapters can be grouped into four parts. While Chapters 1e4 focus on mistakes specific to different sections of research papers, Chapters 5e7 look at the general mistakes that may occur anywhere in a text. The final two chapters address errors in less familiar academic genres such as letters for journal submissions and presentations. Chapters consist of a number of sections, each presenting one tip. Within each section are several examples of typical mistakes taken from authentic texts, together with corrected versions. For most tips, examples are followed by three sub-sections. “Mistake” analyzes the mistakes in the examples, “Solution” explains how to avoid the mistakes, and “Impact” explains both the negative impact of the mistakes and the positive impact of the solutions on the reader. For further reference, some chapters provide a list of books and free downloadable materials.

The first four chapters provide tips on how to avoid the mistakes specific to each section of a research report. To avoid abstracts and titles that may be uninformative and mislead the reader, Wallwork and Southern suggest making a list of key words that concisely reflect the content of the paper, identifying the most important key words, and positioning these words at the beginning of the title. To avoid wordy or confusing abstracts, they advise writers to include only essential information and to highlight the importance of the writer’s own study. To compose a structured abstract, writers are advised to use a checklist that reflects the major content of the paper. With regard to the Introduction and literature review sections of a research report, writers are advised to avoid information that is already familiar to the reader. To achieve the necessary conciseness, they need to delete all unnecessary verbs, group previous studies and compare them with what is not yet known about the topic in order to highlight the contribution of their own research.

In Chapter 3, the authors discuss methodology, results, and tables. They first emphasize the importance of tense and sequence in the Methods section, pointing out the importance of using the correct tense to help readers to differentiate between what is normal practice (present tense) and the writer’s research procedures (past tense). They also recommend setting out study procedures in chronological order, using sequence markers to achieve clarity. When writing about study results, Wallwork and Southern point to the necessity of choosing the right tense to differentiate between the writer’s own results and those of others to help reviewers appreciate the value of the writer’s work. They also provide two useful tips relating to tables; namely, the need to provide a commentary that interprets the information in a table instead of simply repeating it, and to use the simple present to describe the significance of a table, and the past to describe what the table shows. Although it is a common practice to put the limitations in the end of Conclusions in research papers, Wallwork and Southern argue for an earlier placement so as to avoid leaving a final impression that is negative. They suggest that limitations need to be justified, not simply listed, and that a text should conclude with a memorable and comprehensible “rounding off” sentence.

After addressing section-specific mistakes, the next three chapters (5e7) discuss mistakes that can occur across a whole text. Chapter 5 returns to the key theme of the book, which is how to improve readability and avoid redundancy. Wallwork and Southern suggest a number of strategies to avoid confused or vague writing: writing clearly and logically, stating the subject of a sentence or paragraph in the opening words, using specific rather than generic terms (e.g. “conglomerate diversification” instead of “a specific type of diversification”), and explicitly specifying the referents of pronouns. Chapter 6 advises writers to improve the readability of their texts by putting the key concept and negations as near as possible to the beginning of sentences and breaking up long sentences when they contain too many distinct ideas. Chapter 7 advises on how to ensure that punctuation and spelling do not compromise the readability of a text.

Chapter 8 shifts its focus to other relatively neglected written academic genres. Wallwork and Southern stress the importance of being aware of the needs of the reader in writing project proposals, letters regarding to journal submissions, and emails. They remind writers to view their own texts from the perspectives of editors or reviewers and give tips throughout this chapter that are designed to establish a positive relationship with the reader (e.g., be reviewer-friendly, positive and diplomatic).

Chapter 9 presents tips for presentations, starting with summarizing typical mistakes that presenters make in their PowerPoint slides (e.g., too much text and too few images). They are of the opinion that the purpose of presentations is not just to present information, but also to sell presenters’ research in order to increase their network of contacts. To achieve these purposes, they advise the writers to choose a fun title, include only essential information, and to ask questions to increase audience attentiveness. This advice helps to make an interesting and informative presentation which will earn credibility for the presenter.

Overall, this book makes three valuable contributions to scholarship on academic writing instructions. The first, is its emphasis on readability - a theme that resonates throughout all the chapters. Second, it highlights the importance of effective communication of information in academic writing. It focuses on how well the writer’s message comes across to the reader, which determines how likely the paper or proposal is to be accepted for publication or funding. The book puts these principles into practice by providing accessible information about key areas of academic writing and by concisely analyzing typical mistakes.

Although the book as a whole is helpful and informative, a few of the tips offered may not be as useful as stated. For example, Tip 12 (regarding the Introduction to a text): “Describe the structure of your paper in a way that enables readers to navigate the paper easily” is not appropriate for all text types. Tip 45: “With certain exceptions, avoid Latin expressions” is also not very useful because using Latin expressions is no longer a common type of mistake. However, the book is nevertheless an immensely valuable guide for novice writers, who will find reading it a helpful experience.
