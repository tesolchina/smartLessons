EAP writing

While a number of studies on peer feedback in academic writing have been done on how students engaged with received feedback in a single assignment, little work has examined engagement with giving feedback and across a longer timeline, which is problematic for a pedagogical technique that is often new to EFL students and should be used repeatedly in a semester. Using a mixed method design that draws upon transcripts of voiced peer comments, monthly reflection journals, semi-structured interviews, stimulated recalls, and two rounds of a self-eficacy survey, this longitudinal study examined how three EFL undergraduates of relatively different proficiency levels affectively, behaviorally, and cognitively engaged with giving feedback over ten iterative feedback practices in an EAP writing course. The findings showed both initial engagement differences and extensive gains in engagement across all three learners despite challenges in proficiency and self-efficacy. Pedagogical implications of how peer feedback could be enhanced in EAP writing courses are discussed.

# 1. Introduction

Per feedback can exert powerful effects on leaning writing in foreign/second language (EFL/ESL) setings, and many studies have uncovered benefis of and challenges to ffective peer feedback (Chang, 2016; Chen, 2016; Hyland & Jiang, 2021; Li et al., 2021; Schunn & Wu, 2019; Vuogan & Li, 2022). Among the constraints limiting learning benefit, engagement with per feedback has come to the foreground in a growing number of studies (Dao t l., 2021; Fan & Xu, 2021; Han & Hyland, 2015; Yu et al, 2019). Much of the focus in past work n engagement in peerfedack has be on how students egage as fback reivers .,Ellis 2010; Fan& Xu, 2021; Han & Hyland, 2015; Tian & Zhou, 2020), not on how students engage as feedback providers, even though providing peer feedback has emerged as the stronger learning opportunity (Lundstrom & Baker, 2009; Papi et al., 2019; Schunn & Wu, 2019; Zong, Schunn, & Wang, 2021a).

In particular, three sets of findings support the focus on providing: providing feedback, not receiving feedback, was found to enhance writing self-eficacy and learning enjoyment (Lee & Evans, 2019; Su & Huang, 2021); the length and number of provided rather than received feedack predicted growth infeedback quality (Zong, Schunn & Wang, 2021b); the length of provided rather than received fedback predicted growth in writing qualit acros academic writing assgnments (ong, Schunn, & Wang, 2021a; Gao & Liu, 2021). Therefore, it is especially important to examine engagement with providing peer feedback.

In academic writing learning per se, peer feedback is an indispensable skill (Yu, 2021). Academic writing has ben commonly portrayed as a complex, effrtful, and stressul task for students (Yu & Liu, 2021). Peer feedback, in the academic writing context, focuses especially on higher-order writing issues, functions to train students' critical thinking skill and to socialize learners into academic dialogue, thereby confronting the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional challenges that academic writing entails for EFL learners (Su & Huang, 2021; Yu et al., 2019). Peer feedback has been practiced across the full range of EFL contexts, from under. graduate EFL students who stil struggle to write academic paragraphs to graduate students who need to finish their master's or doctoral thesis (Zhang, Schunn, Li, & Long, 2020; Yu et al., 2019). Though studies have documented students' concerns and achievements with peerfedack, a longitudinal investigation of the per fedack-giving process in learning academic writing i very much under-explored. A deeper understanding of feedback engagement over time i important to understand what elements naturally develop with experience and which elements need further instructional support for improving academic writing and student emotional well-being.

Drawing upon multipl sources of data including semi-structured interviews, stimulated recalls, voiced per comments, monthly reflection journals, and surveys of students'self-fficacy across a semester, this longitudinal study examined how three students affectively, behaviorall, and cognitively engaged with giving peer fdback over ten academic writing practices at a key university in Northeast China. Tracing longitudinal engagement with giving fedback across term, the study uncovered the dynamics of student engagement with giving feedack, which have pedagogical implications for how to sustain engagement with feedback in EAP writing.

# 2. Conceptualizing student engagement with giving feedback

Engagement generally refers to the way in which students interact with a particular task. Student engagement i frequently regarded as a three-dimensional construct of affective involvement (i., positive, high arousal emotions vs. negative, low arousal emotions), behavioral participation (e.g., completing optional tass or completing required tasks fully and in a timely fashion), and cognitive processing (eg, on-task, semanticlly-rich, and reflective cognition) during lening tass (Fredricks et al., 2004, 2011; Wong & Liem, 2021). In EFL feedback activities student engagement with received feedback has been investigated in terms of emotions about received feedback, amount of revision operations in response to per eedback, and evaluation of received feedback and these aspects have been framed in terms of the three dimensions of egagement (Ells, 2010; Fan & Xu, 2021; Han & Hyland, 2015; Yu et al., 2019).

The current study shifts the focus from receiving feedback to giving feedback, while still applying the affective-behavioral. cognitive dimensions of engagement, since giving peer feedback is as affectively complicated, behaviorally effrtful, and cognitively demanding as receiving it, f not more o. For example, while reeivers could easily choose to ignore feedback, givers are more directl tasked with identifing problems, weighing their importance, considering possible solutions, and phrasing the feedback in a way that wil be persuasive and balanced. Further, the sub-constructs and specifics in each engagement dimension likely have to be adjusted conceptually to the nature of giving rather than receiving feedback.

Affective engagement has predominantly centered on emotion/affect in earl framings of engagement (Fredrick, 2004), but within the literature n engaging with reived feedack, it has also included atitudinal indicators such as value (Ellis 2010; Han & Hyland 2015; Fan and Xu, 2021; Zhang, Li, Long, & Gao, 2019). We argue that value is separate factor from engagement. First, value in itself is not an indicator of the character of the interaction with the fedback task (i.. the engagement ite. Scond, value and affect are not synonymous, with the former prioritizing leaner beliefs and the later focusig on feelings or emotions. Third, a number f studies frame value or other attitudes like elfefficacy as causal factors that shape engagement (Linenbrink & Pintrich, 2003; Zou, Schunn, Wang, & Zhang, 2018; Miwa & Jitosho, 2020) or are reciprocally inluenced by engagement (Bathgate & Schunn, 2017). In line with these studies, the current study examined the affective engagement in terms of emotional valence and willingnes.

In line with the research on engagement with received feedback (Ellis 2010; Han & Hyland, 2015), we conceptualize students behavioral engagement in providing feedback i terms of the observable behaviors in giving peer feedback. An important behavioral index is comment length, which predicts both the helpfulnes of students provided comments (Zong, Schunn, & Wang, 2021b) and how much students learn from providing feedback (Zong, Schunn, & Wang, 2021a). Other indexes such as timely submission of reviews and numbersof submitted reviews could also be used as supplementary behavioral engagement measures (Wu & Schunn, 2021; Zou, Schunn, Wang, & Zhang, 2018, Zong, Schunn, & Wang, 2021a). We do not separate amounts of praise and critical fedack since both can contribute to the perceived value of the comments produced and to the reviewers learning (Patchan, Schunn, & Correnti, 2016).

Work on receiving fdback has conceptualied cognitive engagement i terms of depth of processing such as awareness at the level of noticing (Han & Hyland, 2015). Our conceptualization of students cognitive engagement in providing feedack finds its conceptual support from several foundational models of writing and revising proceses: dentifying problems, diagnosing problems, and resolving problems (Flower et al., 1986; Hayes, 1996; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1983). Writing and peer feedback on writing research often further divides the problems in terms of higher-order content and lower-order language issues, as global isues tend to need deeper processing than do surface isues (e.g., Patchan, Schunn, & Correnti, 2016; Zong, Schunn, & Wang, 2021a; Min, 2005; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1983). The more students identify, diagnose, and resolve problems in randomly assigned writing, the higher their cognitive engagement with giving feedback, especially with deeper processing of higher-order problems (Min, 2018).

Based upon the above analysis, a multi-dimensional framework for learner engagement with providing feedback was constructed and is presented in Table 1.

# 3. Review of empirical studies of student engagement with giving peer feedback

Past studies of student engagement with giving per feedback have typically taken place in higher education contexts where ac. ademic writing and per feedback are increasingly important either in disciplinary courses or in EFL courses (Bathgate & Schunn, 2017, Zhang, Schunn, Li, & Long, 2020; Yu et al., 2019). Thus far, engagement has een conceptualized in terms of three dimensions: student affect student bhaviors, and stdent cogntion. Often thee studes addressed one or two aspet i isolation, and a number of these studies did not use the engagement framework per se.

EFL students, in particular, have demonstrated mixed feelings about providing per feedback. On the one hand, EFL students felt good because t helped thmoice ther idas; on the ther hand, students were ometime frustrad by ther low sef-fficacy (Carson & Nelson, 1994; Zhou et al., 2019). More selfefficacious peers likely flt more positive about offering comments (Gan et al., 2021). However, sometimes such students experienced boredom or frustration when they were too busy to asses their peers' work (Wen & Tsai, 2008). nother aspect faffective engagement i relaed to isues f face. tudents might worry losing face  ther peers when asked to critique their peers (Topping, 2003). However, how students initiall formed or changed their emotions over time needs further investigation.

Peers can perform feedback perfunctorily due to passivity or they can show higher levels of behavioral engagement than even teacher feedack in terms of timelines and responsiveness (Zou, Schunn, Wang, & Zhang, 2018; Topping, 2003). Comment length, another behavior index, is very important because long comments often include useful components such as localization and explanations of the problem, mitigating praise, and potentia solutions (Patchan, Schunn, & Corrnti, 2016, Zong, Schunn, & Wang, 2021a; Min, 2018). In addition, other behaviors such as asking for help,clarification, and negotiation are good signs of learning (Jin et al. 2022). Whether students can sustain good behaviors in providing peer feedback is very much under-researched.

Giving pee feedback critically is by nature, cognitively demanding, as it goes beyond retrieving knowledge of course content, and extends to the clarification of the problem and justification of the solution (Han & Xu, 2020; Min, 2018; Nelson & Schunn, 2009. Thus. the deeper the pr feedback provider thinks, the more citical and useful the provided comments are likely to be. For example, Nelson & Schunn (2009) identified common forms of provided per feedback in terms of mitigating praise, problems only, and problems and suggestions in academic writig, and the last category contributed most to better revision. Gao et al. (2019 found EFL students made critical and useful comments, but they tended not to point out some of the most crucial problems in EAP writig, while Min (2018) suggested peer feedback could approximat teacher feedback in terms of quality and manner. Whether EFL students can point out key problems, explain, and solve them remains a debated isse. In addition, how cognitie features of pr feedback change with expe. rience is underexplored. In academic writing in particular, how students use and develop academic knowledge and writing skills through engagement with giving feedback is largely unknown (Zong, Schunn, & Wang, 2021b; Gao & Liu, 2021; Huisman et al, 2018).

The three dimensions of student engagement may also vary by individual characteristics such as language proficiency and self efficacy in peer feedback. For example, high proficiency reviewers were found to provide more crticism, while low proficiency re viewers provided more praise (Pathan & Schunn, 2015). Student elfefficacy alsoaffectd their emotional engagement with receiving feedback on content and language (Tsao, 2021). The trajectories of engagement with giving feedback could develop diffrently for individual leaners with different starting abilitis and selfefficacies. In-depth longitudinal studies could help uncover the dynamic and complex nature of the thee dimensions of engagement in students' peer feedback-giving practices (Huisman et al., 2018). Such studies could then inform pedagogical practices of how to best engage students in academic writing and fedback over time, as peer feedback is an important academic skill in itself (Liu & Carless, 2006).

# 4. Methods

# 4.1. The study

The study adopted a longitudinal mixed-method study approach to examine in depth how collge students engaged with providing feedback across a semester of consistent reflective practices with peer feedback. Qualitative case studies clarify the nature of engagement and student meaning-making that drives change over time; quantitative analysis helps to situate the cases in larger patterns of change.

Specifically, we asked the following research questions:

What is the overall engagement with providing feedback for the threestudents at the beginning and end of the semester?

$\bullet$ How did students affectively engage with providing feedback over ten iterative practices? $\bullet$ How did students behaviorally engage with providing fedback over ten iterative practices in both quality and quantity? $\bullet$ How did students cognitively engage with providing fedback over ten iterative practices in both quality and quantity?

# 4.2. Context and participants

The research was conducted in afirs-year, eighteen-week academic online writing course with 43 registered students at selective university in Northeast China of aproximately 30,o00students. The focus of the course was to develop English major students' basic academic writing skill such as comparison and definition, and language skills such as sentence variety. The course was given by the first author specializing in EAP. The teaching of academic writing followed a sequence of observation of model writing, emulated writing, peer feedback, reflection, and revisio. Across writing asinments, students were taught, trained on, and evaluated on four essential academic writing skill: unity, support, coherence, and wording/sentence skills (Appendix A). Before students practiced providing feedback around skills in these four areas, they observed model feedback according to four-step fedback strategy, namely "clarify authors intentions, identify problems, explain problems and solve problems" (Min, 2005). For every assgnment, teachers also modeled providing feedback using several student writing samples.

Three irs-year English major undergraduates all19 years old) were selected as focal study participants: Jocelyn, Mandy, and Rosa (pseudonyms) based on both convenience sampling (willingness) and deliberate sampling (variety in writing proficiency and selfefficacy). The students were Chinese native speakers from small urban cities in three different provinces, but had studied English for at least ten years, with English test scores ranging from 135t 143 out of a fll score 150 in the university's entrance examination (which is i the upper level across the country). As English majors atending a selective universty, they generally had high motivation for learning writing, and high motivation is a relevant factor in engagement with learning tasks (Huisman et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2019). They reported that their previous writing experiences in English were typicall only short writingassignments of approximately 150 words, so academic paragraph and esay writing was till hallenging for allof them. Based upon diagnostic writig test (Appendx B) administered in the first writing session and initial sef-fficacy survey (Appendix C) responses, Jocelyn was a high proficiency (6/7)/midding self-fficacy (7.5/10) writer, Mandy was a low proficiency (5.25/7)/midding self-eficacy writer (7/10) and Rosa was a low proficiency (5/7)/low selfefficacy writer (2.6/10). The fact that these three students had no prior experience giving peer feedback provided an excellent opportunity to study growth in engagement as a function of experience.

# 4.3. Procedures

DingTalk was used for instruction, peer reviewing, surveying, and interviewing. DingTalk is afree communication and collaboration platform that can be used to support group discussions and online whole class meetings. Students as writer could upload draft to a group discussion board. tudents as reviewers could download and evaluate their peers' files through audio/written messages. Peer feedback was given in a mixture of Chinese and English, but most often in Chinese.

Students were asked to voice peer comment in DingTalk every Friday for the whole semester. Then they began peer commenting on Friday afernoon and completed the reviewing by Sunday. Students were instructed to submit their fedback for at least three randomly-selected peer esays before the submission deadine. Therefore, aross the 10 assgnments that were roughly weekly from wees 2 through 13, each student was asked to complete t least thirty reviews. The specific ssignments are presented in Appendix C, and the timeline of all major classroom tasks and data collection activities are presented in Appendix D.

Two surveys of student selfefficacy in writing were collected from all students in clas at the beginning and end of the semester (Appendix ). Allstudents were also asked to submit thre reflection journals at roughly one month intervals. In these journal entries, students were required to write around thre hundred English words about four topics: progres in writing, problems in writing, thir experiences with peer feedback, and their learning plans for the following month.

Semi-structured interviews with the three focal students were conducted in Chinese by three research asstants at the end of the term. Each interview lasted approximately $3 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ . The interviews involved the following questions: "How did you give feedback at the beginning/end?", \*Could you manage to give feedback?", \*How did you fee about giving fedback at the beginning/end?", and Why did you do peer review earlier/later?"

In order to triangulate findings, we collected threestimulated recalls with the three focal participants based upon entrie from the monthly reflection journals and observed feedback-giving behaviors at the end of the course. Each stimulated recall lasted $5 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ One research assistant modeled how to do a stimulated recallbased upon a piece of feedback before the participants completed the task. Question prompts given during thestimulated recall were: \*What were you thinking when you gave this piece of advice?", What rewards were you thinking about when you wrote giving peer fedback was rewarding?", and How were you feeling when you saw your advice was taken?"

# 4.4. Engagement measures

Engagement was measured quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of threecore engagement dimensions across each month of the semester. For each dimension, at each point in time, a dominant approximate level (low, medium, or high) was coded. By dominant, we mean the most common character acros time and sources. These codes were approximate in the sense that there was some variability across data sources.

For affective engagement, only qualitative coding was done. Predominantly negative emotions about the process of providing feedback (e.g., dislike) was coded as low, predominantly positie emotions (e., enjoyment) were coded as high, and mixed valence emotions or neutral emotions (e.g., nervous) as medium.

Quantitatively, behavioral engagement was based primarily upon effort as measured by the word length of provided peer comments. Word length was determined using transcripts of the auditory files. The transcripts from each review ranged widely in length, from as short as 120 words to as long as 1,879 words. Students had approximately three asignments per month and therefore a minimum of at least nine reviews to complete each month. To compare the three learners with reference to the ful set of 43 students whole range of word length, we used 400 words as a dividing line because it was roughly the mean length for all students in the first month. For behavioral engagement, having a mean comment length per month of les than 4,oo words was coded as low, having a mean comment length between 4,00 words and 8,000 words was coded as medium, and having a mean comment length greater than 8,000 words was coded as high. No off-topic comments were found. In addition, the timelines of the feedback was taken into account as a secondary indicator of behavioral engagement: whether students' completion of feedback was ahead of time, on time (just before the deadine), or delayed. When all the feedback was on time, only word length was taken as the distinguishing feature.

To support in-depth coding of cognitive engagement in the focal students, the comments students provided were systematically coded in terms of completenes of coverage (i., whether a specific problem was identified, explained, and/or solved). In particular, the number o ientified, explained, and/or solved problems rearding unit, support, coherence, and sentence skill in peer comment was separately coded by two research asstants and checked for consistency by the teacher-researcher (se Table2). Any disagreement was solved through further dussion. The irst hre catgories belong to higher-order global ises, while the last catory fouses on local issues such as grammar and word choice. The coverage of the comments was coded exhaustively. As a follow-up, comments were further examined to see whether students merely identified problems or whether they also explained the problems (e.., \*The washing spoon' sentence reaks the coherence in between [..) and provided solutions (e.g., \*Change show into shows" or Add more facial expressions of your parents to intensif the tone'). A selection of representative comments made by each student at different time points are given in the results section.

For qualitative coding of cognitive engagement, lack of full coverage of the focal aspects of writing concern i.., those of focus in the course and in the peer reviewing prompt) in the review comments (e.g, no discussion of unity issues) was coded as low, full coverage but wth ittle diaosis of identified problems (ie. fw explanations or possiblesolutions to identified probles) was coded as medium, and full coverage with consistently provided explanations and solutions was coded as high. As a quantitative measure of cognitive engagement, the greater the number of identified higher-order problems, the deeper and higher the cognitive engagement. Note that the coding of higher-order or lower-order comment concerns is described in Table 2. Note that while the reviewing rubric encouraged students to focus on higher-level writing isues, there were a wide variet f low-level issues that students could detect in each document and thus it was possbl fr a student t focus heavily on higher-lvel isues or predominantly on lower-lel isues in this context.

In addition, to provide convergent evidence of engagement, indicators of affctive, cognitive, and to some extent, behavioral engagement were coded from the reflection journals, stimulated recall, and semi-structured interviews. Note that two different aspects of affective engagement could be extracted from these sources (emotional valence and motivational ste). The top of Table 3 presents the coding scheme and specific examples that generated each code from those data sources.

# 5.1. Overall student engagement with giving peer feedback

Table 4 presents a ranking of engagement levels over the semester for the three focal students. At the beginning of the semester, one of the lower proficiency writers, Rosa, had constently low levels of engagement. The other lower proficiency writer, Mandy, began with more midding level of engagement with peerfedack, perhaps related to her higher intial elf-efficacy. The higher proficiency writer, Jocelyn, had mixture of midding and high engagement at the beginning. By the end of the semester allthre had consistently high engagement along the afective and cognitie dimensions, and Jocelyn alone increased to high behavioral engagement although the other two moved up to medium behavioral engagement.

Table 5 highlights the main changes i afecive, behavioral, and cognitive engagement for the three students. Supporting details for this summary assessment are presented in the next three sections.

# 5.2. Students' affective engagement

Overall students' emotions involved in providing peerfeedback and willingnes of doing so grew increasingly more positie, both for the higher proficiency learner Jocelyn and for the lower proficiency learners Rosa and Mandy, as their self-eficacy in doing peer feedback improved from the beginning (Joycelyn 7.5/10, Rosa 2.6/10, Mandy 7/10) to the end (Joycelyn 8.7/10, Rosa 7/10, Mandy 8.4/10).

Jocelyn: Moving from "anxious about giving critical comments' to "feeing grateful for the process'. Despite being a higher proficiency write, celyn was itilly anxious about the proces.  was very worried about giving onine pe fedack, beuse it is randomly assgned. Many times I was not well acquainted with the peer writer., shesaid in the stimulated recall. However, only two rounds of pee comments later, when she found she \*could lea so much from her peers writing, she felt amazed" as she wrote in her first reflction journal. I the stimulated recall she reported, When I found cassmates were serious in wanting to mprove themselves through my comments, I wanted to offer more comments as needed. Her comments often ended with an invitation, \* we could have a chat and exchange ideas further about it he soon came to take giving comments as very enjoyable and rewarding experience as she wrote "I am grateful for this [peer review] proces ." in her first reflection journal. Jocelyn was among the first to appreciate peer feedback as a learning activity.

Rosa: Moving from I detest peer feedback' to I felt good' when getting sincere thanks. At first, Rosa was very reluctant, as she wrote in her journal, I can take others suggestions, but I don't want to make comments on others'. When asked to clarify what she was thinking at the time in the stimulated recall she confided, my peer classmates are o capable of doing peer comments, feelvery, very incompetent and I detest peer feedback also because I have to present my comments in an open space where everyone can be heard". She went on to explain,  have never experienced peer comment since childhood, and I am not that extroverted to vocalize my ideas that way." She was so araid of losing face in an open conversation space, she asked for permission from the writing instructor about whether she could speak personally to others. When her instructor persuaded her of the benefits of accessing all the voiced messages, she did not persist in her resistance. She changed her mindset later, as her self-fficacy for pee commenting improved dramatically and she told the teacher that she could give more useful comments as her peers responses to her comments turned to be vey positive. She aid in an interview, eedack became part of my Friday academic life. When  gave fedack o others, got sincere thanks in return and I felt good about it."

Mandy: Moving from "super-nervous' about the tone and criticality of the peer feedback to "more direct in commenting". Although also a lower proficiency writer, Mandy did not fee so incompetent in giving feedback as did Rosa. She was \*super-nervous about her critical feedback's side effects on others because she felt heart-broken by so many critical comments on her irst writing when she was interviewed at the end of the semester about her emotional experience. She wanted to make sure the content and the tone of voice involved a lot of praising before providing a critical comment. Around two months ater, when she found that her pers were also becoming used to such critical and useful feedback by addressing her nickname and answering with more \*thank you" and "kiss' emoticons and a promise to solve the problems, she became more relaxed:  became more direct in commenting, by starting with 'to cut the praise short, I found several issues in the paper'"

# 5.3. Students' behavioral engagement

Al thre students were highly punctual per reviewers who completed the required number of reviews and showed development in length of peer comments. Individually, however, they showed some developmental differences.

# 5.3.1. Qualitative signs of behavioral engagement

Though the instructor told them to do it within thre days, and many students did it right after cass on Friday, including Rosa and Joycelyn. Mandy improved her timelinessaround one and a half months later: she finished reviews on the second day at the beginning, but later changed to completing reviews immediately after class as she reported in the interview,  wanted to catch up with others in providing feedback'". Rosa, the other weak writer, also extended her behavioral engagement: she reported asking her roommates more for help when she wanted to give high quality pee feedback in the midde of the semester and reduced asking for such help by the end. Jocelyn's behavioral engagement was highest in two more ways. First, when appreciating peer work, Jocelyn sometimes \*wrote down fantastic sentence patterns and persuasie examples" produced by her peers, as she noted in her second reflection journal, though she herself quite often was already the very best student writer in the clas. Second, at the end of her comments, she always added a sentence, if here were any more sses, I would like totalk about it with you further. A privat follow-up conversation via ingTalk sometimes followed.

# 5.3.2. Quantitative signs of behavioral engagement

Comment word length documented their behavioral changes. Although Jocelyn, the initiall higher proficiency writer, began with comments that were generally twice as long as those made by the other two students, comments generally grew in length for allthree students, particularly from the first to second month (se Fig. 1). Compared with their first experience, the comment length was quite often doubled, even tripled, or quadrupled sometimes. At the beginning, Rosa said sadly about her comment length, \*my first voiced comment lasted only $2 8 \ : s$ (120 Chinese words), simply because I had no idea about what else to say about the draft."

Deeper cognitive processing of peer texts can be traced through qualitative and quantitative comparisons of comments made between the first and last months.

# 5.4.1. Qualitative signs of cognitive engagement

In terms of providing comments on al focal aspects of writing and with deper comments including explanations and solutions, the two low proficiency writers, Rosa and Mandy, showed considerable development over time. Typical (translated) problem-focused comments for all three students in the first and last month are shown in Table 6.

At first, Rosa did not identify any \*unity' (sticking to one point in writing) problems though such issues actually occurred quite often in this group of EFL writers. For example, she did not point out the problem that a family's love towards a person was not the person's own passion in the irst writig f my three passions" Interestingly, Rosa had made the same mistake in her own first writing Mandy did alittlebit better than Rosa in identifying problems at the start. She could identify more problems, though often not witha thoughtful recommendation for improvement (e.g., see the example comments for Mandy's first month in Table 6). Approaching the final month, both Rosand Mandy gave critical comment, explanations of the problem, and useful suggestions for improvement (e.g., see the example comments for their ast month in Table 6). By contrast, the high proficiency writer, Jocelyn, would acount for why there was a problem and usuall recommended a solution for improvement throughout the semester (eg, Jocelyn's comments for the first and final month in Table 6). More ubtle improvements over time could be identified in Jocelyn's comments: she came to skilfully use the key words of unity, support, and coherence in commenting. For example, she roughly identified coherence as "logic" at the beginning, but inally realized that sentential transition is a key component of coherence e.g., Joycelyn's comments on coherence in Table 6), as she reflected in the stimulated recall.

In terms of cognitive strategies, ll of them reported the use of learning sources when giving fedback. Jocelyn reported in her first monthly reflection journal that she began to use dictionaries to look up new words or new interpretations of familiar words when giving feedback. The same occurred with Mandy and Rosa, who reported i their second monthly reflection journal that they often searched online for information about usage, spelling, and collocations.

# 5.4.2. Quantitative signs of cognitive engagement

The number of identified higher-order problems each month (four wees of peer feedback) also showed changes in the depth of the three students' cognitive processing (see Fig. 2). Overall, the three peers generally pointed out more higher-order problems as time progressed across the semester.

# 6. General discussion

Previous studies involving EFL writing or higher education in general have typically documented engagement levels in terms of one-shot engagement with receiving feedback (Fan & Xu, 2021; Han & Hyland, 2015; Winstone & Carless, 2020; Yu et al., 2019). By contrast, the current observational study shfted the focus to the evolving levels of students' engagement with providing feedback in EAP writing across three months of experience with providing feedback, which is under-explored and requiring systematic scrutinization (Huisman et al., 2018). Previous studies found relatively low cognitive engagement levels in provided feedback such as relatively low concern with higher-order writing issues in general or academic genre-specific issues (Fan & Xu, 2021; Yu, 2021; Yu et al., 2019). They also found low proficiency, low motivation, or negative afect which limited participation (Han & Xu, 2020; Yu, 2021; Yu et al., 2019). Similarl, the current study also identified low engagement levels at the beginning of the semester. However, the current study found generally high engagement with giving feedback at the end of a semester, even in lower proficiency students: all students found more higher-order writing issues, accomplished the review task with many comments and high timeliness, and harbored positie emotions. The study also provided further support for three additional positive elements of per feedback in EFL writing contexts: 1 feedback-giving as an especiall important learning opportunit (Cho & Cho, 2010; Lundstrom & Baker, 2009); 2) iterative feedack practices' having positive efects on academic writing (Zong, Schunn, & Wang, 2021b; Han & Xu, 2020; Yu, 2019); and 3) the development of students' feedback literacy in academic writing (Yu & Liu, 2021).

What can account for the generally positie findings in the current study? One possible explanation is that students sampled in the current study were English major freshmen from a selective universty, so they generally had high motivation to learn academic writing. Indeed, these students demonstrated high agency in learning through negotiation with peers or the teacher and finished feedback ahead of time (Li & Zhang, 2021; Wang & Lee, 2021; Wei, Sun, & Xu, 2020; Yu & Liu, 2021). However, two of the focal students had lower writig proficiency. Further, theattitudes towards peer feedback for all three tudents were geerally negatie at the beginning, and their overall engagement levels were not high at that point in time. Thus, it is likely the opportunity to practice providing feedback as a regular routine was useful for them to develop strategies and skill for providing feedback at higher levels of engagement (Zong, Schunn, & Wang, 2021b). Thus, diffrent from the more negative findings obtained in studies of one round of peer feedback (Ga0 & Yu, 2019; Fan & Xu, 2021; Yu, 2021), this longitudinal study observed that as students reviewed more essays, they were able to cognitively process more higher-order writing issues.

![](img/a74d1b2032030c6db42af1c3802c2554ed3a57c13a8dc04e0d47fb78f294e751.jpg)  
Fig. 2. Monthly records of identified higher order problems For ech month, for each focal student, the number of higher-order text problems given in peer comments.

We note however that not all forms of practice with pee feedack wil produce growth in per feedback (Zong, Schunn, & Wang, 2022). The current study involved some pedagogical strategies which likely positively shaped the students' growth in engagement: random grouping (Zhang et al., 2020), multi-peer review (Schunn & Wu, 2019), and voiced messages (Lehrer et al., 1987). These elements likely enriched students' review experience compared with more typical pair work. For example, Wang (2014) found students view such feedback as gradually decreasing in usefulnessas they could almost predict their paired eer's questions or avice. In addition, the instructor also played a role in providing a supportive task environment such as through feedback modeling (e.g. modeling the four-step strategy in giving feedback) and feedack process monitoring (e., teacher persuading Rosa to comment in an online space) by increasing their competence, reduced students' worre, and thus enhancing students' engagement with fedback.

Although engagement enhancement seems not centall dependent upon proficiency and selfefficacy in the three cases, ther proficiency and self-eficacy in giving peer feedback probably mediated their engagement as found in previous studies Linnenbrink & Pintrich, 2003; Zhou et al., 2019. The two intilly lower proficiency learners Rosa and Mandy engaged les well as they were frustrated by either thir low sef-fficacy in giving comments or low writing skill evidenced in initiallystruggling to identify problems. Rosa, as n extremely low selfefficacy learner among the whole group, felt unable to give others citique and was usure of her possily \*wong" coments useulness owever, it was ao intresting that Mandy, with higher selfefficy, doubtd hat giving peer comments was beneficial to herelf. To compare the thre, the highest proficiency leaner Jocelyn felt rather confident about giving pee fedack and her own writing though anxious about her critical comments. Interestingly, she adjusted her afect sooner and maintained intensive engagement.

Importantly, these students appeared to demonstrate assessment knowledge of academic writing through cumulative engagement with feedback: 1) Rosa, who initilly could not identify unity problems, tuned out to cover all areas of higher-order issues; 2) Mandy added more problem localizations and explanations before giving relevant suggestions; and 3) Joycelyn more skilfully used the assesment rubrics to talk about problem isue. Despite initial disparity in cognitive engagement, all thre focal students completed the four stes identify author intentions, clarify problems, explain problems, give sugestions) of peer review very well by the end of the semester. Such cognitive engagement could prepare them for higher quality academic dialogue and academic community (Gao & Yu, 2019; Yu & Liu, 2021).

# 7. Conclusion

The three students' engagement with providing feedback changed longitudinally for the better across the three engagement dimensions. Though their itia affective engagement towards per fedback were not very favorable, their accumulated experience with giving feedack transformed them into engaging in higher engagement with peer feedback in this learning environment. Compared with high proficiency learner Jocelyn, lower proficiency learners Mandy and Rosa showed more dramatic improvements.

Pedagogically, the findings llustrate how students could develop their engagement for the beter as their experience f it deepens. More experience with feedack reduces Jocelyn and Mandy's worries about their problem-focused comments, as wellas Rosa's strong resistance againt giving fdback. For FL intructors new to the usef eer feedback, the current stuy may address doubts they may develop from initiatin fdack activitie only once or twicetheir students might come to more positive engagement with additional (well supported) practice. The current study also suggests some elements that are likely useful for establishing a supportive academic writing learning environment, such as encouraging students to share writing and peer comments in an open too like Dingtalk, using multi-peer review; and diversifying students'reader groups by randomizing peer reviewers, modeling a good per feedack process (Min & Chiu, 2021), using a genre-centered teaching approach (Hu, 2005), and providing social-afective support (Xu & Carles 2017). As the findings also suggest that initial low selfefficacy limits their initial engagement with per feedack (Linnenbrink & Pintrch, 2003), teachers could give surveys to learn which students have low selfefficacy and pay special attention to those low efficacy students. For example, the teacher's dialogic feedback in the current study lesened low self-eficy lener Rosas frustration and resistance.

Methodologically, the current study provides example of a range of qualitative and quantitatie measurement strategies that could be used in studie of pr feedback engagement, eriching the qualitative approach in feedback participation studie (Han & Xu, 2020; Yu, 2019). For example, particular emotions, countable cognitive and behavioralefforts examined in this study could be the basis of larger scale studes that use techniques adapting the specific indicators oserved in this study, such as emotion checkis, quantitative counts of comment length, or feedback self-efficacy surveys.

However, additional work is needed to examine the generalizaility of the current findings across alarger number of learners and especiall across range of instructional contexts. Other limitations of the study need to be addressed i future work First using the three-dimensional engagement construct as the framework, the study explored how students engaged over time through several salient but potentially indirect indicators. Other more direct approaches to measuring students' engagement such as think-aloud were not used. Second, more systematic engagement surveys could be desined to triangulate findings. Finall, the causes of their growing engagement need more systematic scrutinization.
