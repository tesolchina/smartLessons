The ability to write for academic purposes isa vital skil for post-secondary students and early career scholars. Zhihui Fang's new book entitled Demystifying academic writing: Genres, moves, sill, and strategie is a welcome addition to the existing literature on a. ademic writing that responds to the needs of readers with varied prior knowledge to improve their writing abilit for academic purposes. This book is valuable reference for academic writing and an indispensable strategictoolkit for readers writing for academic purposes. Itis multi-functional in terms of assting with the learning of basic skill and strategies for academic writing, writing in different genres, as well as with cultivating the skills of comprehensive writing ability.

Adopting a functional linguistics perspective, this book reveals how typical functions such as engaging readers, presenting information, developing arguments, embedding perspectives, and structuring cross-genre and interdisciplinary texts are creatively realized in academic language. The book comprehensively expounds on a wide range of aspects of academic writing, including the major writig genres in post-secondary education, releant rhtorical moves, basic skill, language resources, and stratees, as well as the skill of cultivating comprehensive writing aility. I is acomprehensive resource that has the potntial to efectively guide readers from various backgrounds to succeed in the field of academic writing and academic publishing.

The book is divided into thre sections (12 chapters in total) and two appendices. To prepare readers for a better understanding of the following chapters, the first two chapters in Section 1 introduce the definition and inguistic features of academic writing by comparing example texts of academic writing with those of daily writing, thereby providing readers with necessary background knowledge. In Chapters 3 and 4, Skill and strategies for academic witig, the author provides a lucid description of ixten essential skills cloely related to academic writing abilities and the linguistc resources and strategies required to realize these skill, by providing information about what (definition), why (importance), and how (writing steps). Examples of good and flawed texts are included toilluminate typical erors and key oints that need to be attended to regarding eac kill These case analyse ae helpful for inviting readers to reflect on their own writing, learn lessons and avoid similar errors in subsequent texts.

Six key academic writing genres (i.e., reading response, book review, literature review, argumentative essays, empirical research articles, and grant proposals ae addressed in detail in Section 2 (Chapters 5-10). The organization f each chapter in this part of the book follows the sequence of general introduction, rhetorical moves of writing, sample text analysis, and a chapter summary, which together lead readers to first understand the above-mentioned genres, then lean and structure the content of various genres, and later deepen their understanding of the main points of academic writing It is worth mentioning that the author also touches upon grant proposals (Chapter 10), an academic witing genre largely negcted in similar books, which further enances ts usefulnes to readers.

The last section (Chapters 11 and 12) focuses on skill of cultivating comprehensive writing ability and improving publishing success. ompared with the more theoretical content of the previous two sections, the inal par fthe book presents experience-based advice and suggetions that are both practical and relevant. For example, with regard o overcoming cultural barrr, the autor tell a story about how he, as a Chinese scholar, has been able to overcome differences between Chinese and Western cultures and thinking modes along his academic journey. Personal accounts such as these may help other non-native speakers of English daunted by similar problems. In addition, to meet the needs of readers who seek to publish thir work, the author outlines the publishing proces, manuscript review, and strategies to boost the success of getting a manuscript accepted for publication.

A distinctive strength of this ok is that itis witten from the perspective of functional linguistc rather than traditional grammar. For example, when inroducing the basic skils and strategies of aademic writing and different academic writing genres, the author highlights a series of functions established by a system in which vocabulary and grammar choices are interrelated in academic writing, such as atracting readers, advancing arguments, and organizing texts across genres and disiplines. The author regards language as a resource for creating meaning and advises readers to pay attention to language choices in key genres of academic writing rather than general but scattered grammatical rule. This may help readers to manage the language dificulties inherent in the writing process and to complete the writing task at hand by making language choices that are practical, appropriate, and effective.

Compared with similar books dedicated to guidance for writing journal rticles (e.g., Belcher, 2019),corrcting students mistakes in the writing proces (e.g., Wallwork & Southern, 2020), or achieving clarity and elegance in academic writing (e.g., Williams & Bizup, 2014), the scope of this book is more comprehensive in that it covers not only the basic skill and strategies of academic writing, but also the writing of academic genres. For students and scholars with diverse academic backgrounds, its content is relevant and practical. Each chapter provides various authentic examples from different disciplines to assist in llustrating particular rhetorical moves and linguistic features that could be used as models, as well as the sils, resource, and stratgies needed to writ in these genres. For novices in particular, the book can effectively help them overcome feelings of ignorance about fundamental aspects of academic writing. Its writing stl is accessible: Fang directly addresses readers throughout the book as if having a personal conversation with them, which reduces the distance between author and readers, and strengthens the impact of the text.

To encourage readers to apply chapter knowledge to their own writing practice, the author has included customized practice activities at the end of each chapter. These exercises are likely to promote reader agency and stimulate thinking; however, the workload involved in completing all exercises would be considerable. Completing the tasks would require time and energy to search for appropriate material, and the absence of possible answers for these open-ended tasks might further discourage readers. If some auxiliary matrils orreoures could be rovidd in codac with the prctice activitie, it might ict betr lig ome for readers. In addition, some example texts are presented in great detail, which could obscure the focus and conciseness of the chapters.

In sum, Fang's new book makes a thought-provoking and easy-to-understand discussion on understanding what academic writing is, learning about customary writing practice, and seeking successful publication. This book could be used not only as a textbook for academic writing courses but alsoas a useful guide for self-study materials. We belie it i abook that willatrct and be useful for academic writing researchers, instructors, and learners..
