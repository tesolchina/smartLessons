Recent studies have argued for an understanding of voice in academic writing that goes beyond the expression of a ’personal’ voice to include writers’ sociohistorically-shaped and dialogically-negotiated agency. While several studies adopt this more expansive conception of voice, very few are situated within a pedagogical context. This study investigates thesis writing groups offered by a learning centre at an Australian university to better understand their role in assisting students’ voice construction. Each group consists of five students and a facilitator; during group meetings members exchange oral feedback on one another’s writing. The participants were twelve postgraduate students and data were collected through observation and audiorecordings of group conferences, student and facilitator interviews and students’ drafts and revisions. Adopting activity systems analysis (Engestrom, 2001), we focused on the writing conferences and the revising activity. The € study suggests that writing conferences facilitate the inter-psychological and intrapsychological processes of voice construction. In the writing conference, students’ social worlds intersect, bringing to bear the power and social structure, value systems and ideologies of scholarly writing. Revising is construed as a multivoiced activity that enables the writer to construct their own voice. The findings also suggest principles of designing social interactions for voice construction.

# 1. Introduction

Voice remains a topic of enduring but elusive interest to those who study academic writing (Tardy, 2012). Where there appears to be agreement, however, is that voice is no longer considered as referring solely to personal and individualistic expression in written discourse. Recent developments in the study of voice in academic writing have expanded our conception of voice and its locus from orientations that are more personal and textual towards more social and dialogic orientations (see Matsuda, 2015; Tardy, 2012 for more detail). Prior (2001) puts forward a “dialogic, sociohistoric notion of ‘voice’” (p. 79) that draws on the work of Bakhtin and Vygotsky and that informs our understanding of voice construction in this paper. Voice, in this view, is co-constituted; it is both personal and social.

Despite a growing number of studies examining voice construction in written texts within this expanded conception, as Tardy (2016) recently noted, “surprisingly few studies of voice are situated in classrooms” (p. 359). Furthermore, Canagarajah (2015) has identified a specific need for research in multilingual pedagogical contexts to inform practice as to how feedback, instruction and interaction assist in the shaping of voice. In this paper, we discuss how thesis writing groups can offer pedagogical affordances to mediate the complex navigation by writers from diverse backgrounds of the institutional and disciplinary expectations of their doctoral or master’s theses. In these groups, students working with a facilitator both give and receive oral feedback on their writing drafts. Specifically, we examine oral feedback exchanges as a pedagogy for voice construction in thesis writing group conferences, utilizing activity systems analysis in order to better understand the affordances of this pedagogy for situated dialogic voice construction. We examine not only the oral feedback on initial drafts in the group meetings but also consider how feedback is taken up in the revising process as students return to the group with their revised drafts. We conclude with a consideration of the extent to which the pedagogy of the writing group could be taken up in other sites within higher education.

# 1.1. Dialogic and social voice construction and pedagogy

Quite where to locate a writer’s voice in written text continues to intrigue scholars of academic writing; Matsuda’s (2001) definition of voice as the “amalgamative effect of the use of discursive and non-discursive features that language users choose, deliberately or otherwise, from socially available yet ever-changing repertoires” (p. 41) is now widely acknowledged as capturing both the textual and extra-textual dimensions of voice. Our study is particularly interested in the ways in which this “amalgamative effect” is produced, as instanced through the writing groups mentioned above.

Tardy (2012, 2016) and others (e.g., Dressen-Hammouda, 2014; Morton & Storch, 2019; Prior, 2001; Xu & Zhang, 2019) draw on Bakhtin (1981) to argue for an understanding of voice that is individual, social, and dialogical. Voice then bears traces of an individual’s sociohistoric trajectory which shapes the resources they have available as to how they may represent themselves textually and it is dialogic inasmuch as it also anticipates and responds to the imagined reader’s impression of the writer. In thesis writing, the imagined reader is the supervisor/examiner who represents the discipline and its expectations but, as Dressen-Hammouda (2014) points out, many of these expectations are largely implicit and may be particularly difficult for multilingual students to access. Starke-Meyering (2011) identified what she called the “paradox of writing in doctoral education” (p.77), which is that the supervisors and advisors already socialised into a disciplinary community’s knowledgemaking practices may not be able to explicitly articulate to their students what they need to know and do in order to become successful. Our study focuses on this implicit knowledge in voice construction, specifically, tacit assumptions and practices (also referred to by Matsuda [Matsuda, 2016, p. 105] as “metadisciplinary knowledge”).

One of the greatest challenges academic writers face is what Bakhtin refers to as the multivoiced or polyphonic nature of discourse which always appropriates and incorporates the words, expressions, assumptions, and styles of others (1981). Writers constantly negotiate with what Talbot (1992) describes as “text populations” (p. 174) - a “mesh of intersecting voices of characters inhabiting a text” (p. 176) many of whom are more powerful or have higher status than the student writer (Starfield, 2002) producing texts that are layered constructions of multiple voices and complex negotiations (Canagarajah, 2015). In particular, multilingual students seeking to participate in new academic communities and to develop a “voice” in their thesis or dissertation writing that is recognised as being “of the field” may be challenged by what is tacitly assumed rather than articulated. Voice, in Dressen-Hammouda’s (2014) terms, both constructs and maintains “the relationship between writer and reader” creating “a co-constructed, shared sociocognitive space that allows readers and writers to situate one another” (p.16). As we argue in this paper, oral feedback exchanges in thesis writing conferences provide such a shared space, enabling multiple discourses from a range of social worlds to be negotiated.

Previous studies based on dialogic and social views of voice have investigated writers’ construction of voice in relation to past and present social contexts. Some studies have focused on texts and have shown how a writer’s association with a disciplinary field is manifested discursively (e.g., Dressen-Hammouda, 2014, 2008; Hyland, 2000; Xu & Zhang, 2019). In Xu and Zhang’s study of L2 doctoral students’ thesis writing experiences, the students’ voice in their theses is negotiated as their epistemologies develop though their interactions with others in their discipline such as supervisors and scholars in their fields.

The study of voice has also been extended to include the reader’s activity, namely readers’ constructions of the writer’s voice mediated by text in certain writing contexts, such as peer reviewing or writing assessment (e.g., Matsuda & Tardy, 2007; Morton & Storch, 2019; Tardy & Matsuda, 2009). These studies have found that certain features of the text, both discursive (e.g., signs of the author’s language background, sentence structures, errors, writing styles) and non-discursive (e.g., manifested depth and breadth of knowledge, topic choice, representation of the field, description of the research setting), have an impact on the reader’s construction of aspects of the author’s identity. Tardy (2012) found that the author’s extra-textual identity plays a role in the reader’s construction of the author’s voice and their assessment of the text. However, the study also stresses that these relationships are dynamic and idiosyncratic, involving personal histories, sociocultural backgrounds, and contextual factors. Drawing on these findings, Tardy (2012) argues that studies on voice need to move beyond textual analysis to a consideration of various aspects of the context in order to better understand the role of the reader’s activity in constructing the author’s voice. Matsuda (2015) argues that while descriptive studies of various textual features and functions will continue to play a central role in studies of the construction and negotiation of voice, further investigation is necessary as to how these features and functions of the text interact with various contextual factors, such as different genres as well as interactions between readers and writers. Our study explores a pedagogical context e the thesis writing group - where both readers’ and writers’ tacit assumptions and practices from their social worlds interact through the exchange of feedback on participants’ writing.

Wertsch’s (1991) discussion of how Bakhtinian notions of “hidden dialogicality” (Bakhtin, 1984, p. 197) and voice can be integrated with Vygotskyan theories of development help us further understand the role of oral feedback exchange in the writing group, specifically, but not solely, in the revising activity. For Vygotsky (1978), the development of human mind takes place firstly in the inter-psychological plane (between individuals) and then in the intra-psychological plane (within an individual mind). Inter-psychological mental functioning precedes intra-psychological functioning where what has been represented on the inter-psychological plan is internalised. Not dissimilarly, Bakhtin writes

imagine a dialogue of two persons in which the statements of the second speaker are omitted …. The second speaker is present invisibly, his words are not there, but deep traces left by these words have a determining influence on all the present and visible words of the first speaker (p. 197).

Whether in the writing group or during individual revising outside of the group meeting, the voices of others are constantly being responded to by participants and, for Bhaktin, these voices are never purely individual but profoundly social.

As mentioned above, despite the increasing interest in voice in academic writing, very few studies have considered the ways in which “deliberately or otherwise” (Matsuda, 2001, p. 41) student writers’ voice may be facilitated in classroom settings. Cangarajah (2015) adopted an ecological perspective to investigate a student’s dialogic voice construction in a course on teaching second language writing. The study reports on the trajectory of a Japanese Master’s degree student’s negotiation of textual and extra-textual resources to construct her desired voice in a web-supplemented, practice-based, collaborative course that Canagarajah had developed and was teaching. The study examines both the student’s and Canagarajah’s perspectives on writing that they brought to the class, tracing the processes of dialogicality and co-construction of voice in a multilingual educational setting, and explores how the student negotiated with various discursive resources both internally and within the classroom ecology. Specifically, the student engaged with her reading of the feedback from her peers and Canagarajah, her previous history of texts, and the many “repertoires” of writing provided throughout the course, appropriating these for her own voice construction via the facilitation of the writing course’s pedagogy. Canagarajah also points to the bidirectional voice negotiations between himself and the student to argue that teachers should consider their role as facilitating students’ turning classroom ecologies into pedagogical affordances.

While Canagarajah’s study focused on learners’ voice construction in an educational context where readers and writers interact, Zacharias (2020) developed a dialogic pedagogy that scaffolded the writer’s decisions for voice construction in a writing program. Through participation in oral reverse position debates, group interviews and reading relevant texts, Shan, a student from China, gained a clearer sense of how she might develop a more authoritative academic voice by drawing on other voices. Classroom activities involving spoken language in addition to more traditional written texts appeared significant in this regard.

Still missing from this emerging pedagogical landscape is how to design social interactions in a pedagogy that includes spoken resources and is likely to turn ecologies into affordances. How readers and writers’ tacit assumptions and practices in classroom activities interact with writers’ discursive choices can inform principles for designing social interactions that can lead to improved outcomes for writing development. While the context of our study is the thesis writing group conferences mentioned above in which the main activity is the oral exchange of feedback on writing, we believe that our findings suggest wider implications and we shall discuss these below. Through an examination of the feedback exchanges and of the subsequent revising activity, our study suggests pedagogical affordances for voice construction.

1.2. Constructing voice in oral feedback exchange in group writing conferences

As discussed above, writing should not be understood as an intensely private activity detached from social activities but as a literate activity richly “populated” with other people’s thinking and feeling in the past, present and the future. It emerges in layers of literate activities in different modes of communication over time (Prior, 1998, 2001). In other words, dispersed, situated writing activities at different times and in different contexts come together in the sociohistorical trajectory of one’s literate activity. For Bakhtin (1981), each word we use carries with it the taste of “the context and contexts in which it has lived its socially charged life” (p. 293) and these multiple contexts can be seen to enter and populate the context of each writing group conference through readers and writers’ exchange of feedback. During the oral feedback exchange, the reader constructs the author’s voice in writing as he/she reads and responds to the constructed author’s voice by offering oral feedback. In so doing, the reader is likely to draw on “social” voices that they have experienced (such as perhaps the supervisor’s voice, what they have read or what they may have learned in a past writing class; in short, to return to Matsuda’s definition of voice, the multiple repertoires they would have encountered). In this way, the reader and the writer’s social worlds intersect during the feedback exchange, mediating thinking and attitudes toward voice construction.

As alluded to earlier, the process of revising after the group conference is also a communicative activity that deploys different discourses involving various voices from various contexts and varied thinking and attitudes. These encounters with people’s tacit assumptions and practices play an important role in voice construction by developing a sense of what to write about and how to write in order to achieve thesis writing goals. Specifically, writers can develop a sense of who is likely to use particular phrases, what kinds of contexts to create, and what type of communicative effects their text may produce (Bakhtin,

1981; Prior, 2001). Taking oral feedback exchange in writing conferences as a dialogic communicative activity for voice construction, our study investigates how the students’ tacit assumptions and practices in their social worlds mediate dialogic interaction in the group writing conference, thereby leading to voice construction. Our study thus aims to better understand the pedagogical affordances of oral feedback exchange in developing students’ thesis writing and to consider learning design principles that can facilitate social interactions. The dialogic processes of voice construction are investigated by using activity systems analysis drawing on activity theory which we introduce below (Engestrom, 2001 € ).

# 1.3. Activity systems analysis

As activity theory is a theory of learning and as our study’s focus is on the role that oral exchange plays in writing development through facilitated group interaction, it was appropriate to adopt activity systems as our analytic framework. Activity theory (Engestrom, 2001 € ) has developed from sociocultural theory (Vygotsky, 2012) to further explore the dynamic relationship between an individual’s mind and broader social structures and how this manifests in learning; it thus aligns with the Bhaktinian framing of our study of voice construction.

Engestrom (2001)€ proposes a graphic representation of an activity system (see Fig. 1) which helps to make observable aspects of human mental and social behaviour explicit through invoking the three concepts of rules, the community, and the division of labour (at the base of the larger triangle in Fig. 1). Our study adopts this model in its investigation of oral interactions and voice construction, and we explain below how we use these concepts in our study.

In the writing conference activity, group members use language (both written and spoken) as tools (i.e., discussing writing) to improve their thesis writing. The subject is thesis writers, and the object is theses. The outcome includes what is brought about as a result of the activity, such as improved text. Rules in our study refers to any “rules” that affect decisions about writing, and/or talking about writing such as conventions which may have been largely implicit until expressed in the community of the writing group. The community is the social group that the student perceives themselves to be a member of, such as a writing conference group or a community of disciplinary colleagues. The division of labour explores how tasks are shared based on available/adopted roles and power relations and how these may be negotiated such as what students or supervisors are expected to do in the student-supervisor relationship. Activity theory thus provides a lens through which a range of tacit assumptions and practices that participants carry with them from their social worlds can be identified by examining the interaction of the rules, community, and the division of the labour of the activity.

Using activity systems analysis, this study investigates how oral feedback exchange facilitates thesis writers’ decisionmaking on their writing as they draw on socially and dialogically available repertories for voice construction. Attention is paid to participants’ tacit assumptions and practices in their social worlds and their roles in voice construction. The research questions of this study are:

(1) How do thesis writers’ tacit assumptions and practices mediate their oral feedback exchange in group writing conferences? (2) How does the exchange of oral feedback contribute to thesis writers’ voice construction in revising?

# 2. Methodology

# 2.1. Contexts and participants

The data were collected at a learning centre at an Australian university which offers thesis writing support to postgraduate research students in the form of writing support groups. The program is open to higher degree research students who are writing regularly. Students are assigned to small groups of five at most with a facilitator from the learning centre and meet as a group for writing conferences every two weeks for two hours over a ten-week period. The main focus of the writing group is the exchange of oral feedback on one another’s writing and collaborative editing. Students circulate two-three pages of their writing before each meeting so that they can prepare to offer feedback to each other and receive feedback that may be helpful in their revising.

Twelve postgraduate research students participated in the study. Apart from one student who was enrolled in a master’s by research, all were enrolled in a PhD program. They met in three different groups (A, B, and C) (see Table 1), with two facilitators, Jenny and Alice (pseudonyms), who facilitated the writing conference discussions. Group A was facilitated by Jenny and Groups B and C by Alice. The two facilitators were both native English-speaking Australians and experienced members of the learning centre staff who each had degrees in relevant fields of academic English or education. Group A consisted of five students, three of whom agreed to participate in the study. Richard (Group A) was the only L1 Englishspeaking Australian student in the study. All members of Groups B and C were multilingual, spoke English as an additional language, and agreed to participate in the study. While each group consisted of students from the same or related disciplines, they were generally unfamiliar with each other’s thesis topic areas. Although no information was collected regarding the participants’ language proficiency levels, the university English language entry requirements were set at an IELTS 6.5 overall (minimum 6.0 in each subtest) or equivalent.

# 2.2. Data collection and analysis

Data were collected through non-participant observation and audio-recording of the group conferences, student and facilitator interviews, and students’ written drafts and revisions. Three meetings (approximately six hours) for Group A and five meetings (approximately ten hours per group) for Groups B and C were recorded. Transcripts of the discussion of each participant’s writing were segmented according to the topic they discussed and analysed for the mediational tools (text, oral interactions), rules and the division of labour that students drew on while attending the writing conferences as well as their revising, and the outcome of the activity. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the students and facilitators. Each facilitator was interviewed at the end of the program, while the interviews (40e60 minutes each) with the students were conducted twice (mid-way and after the program), except for Richard, who was only interviewed after the program, due to time constraints. The interviews explored the students’ experiences, motives, and perceptions and asked about their behaviour and actions during the writing conferences and their revision activity.

A general inductive approach (Thomas, 2006) was taken for the content analysis of the data and categories for coding were developed through multiple readings and interpretation of the data. For the analysis of the interview data, we used both a priori categories from the interview guide questions and themes that we identified through our coding process. The categories from the interview guide included past experiences of scholarly writing, giving and receiving feedback, and perspectives on participating in writing conferences, such as motives for attending them as well as the impact of oral feedback on their revising. The themes that we identified through the coding of the data concerned students’ perception of their own learning of how to write a thesis in their own contexts such as disciplinarity, writing for a future, imagined identity, their evaluation of specific kinds of feedback on their own writing and revising, and relationships with their supervisors. As we proceeded with the analysis, we regularly met to refine our coding and re-examine the data and our interpretations. Students’ writing samples were also examined to trace the changes they made based on the oral interactions they had engaged in. In condensed form, many of the themes are represented in Fig. 2 under the various headings.

In conducting the activity systems analysis, we followed the steps suggested by Yamagata-Lynch (2010). We developed narratives to describe each student’s experience during the writing conferences as well as their revising activity, and through iteratively referring to the analysis of the interviews and oral interactions during the conference, we identified elements such as rules and divisions of labour and the relationships between them in the interconnected activity systems of the writing conferences and the revising activity (see Fig. 2).

Fig. 2. The interconnected activity systems of thesis writing through writing conferences

# 3. Findings

Fig. 2 illustrates the activity systems of both the writing conference and subsequent revising. The activities of the three writing conference groups are conceptually treated as one collective activity. These activity systems illustrate how the activity system of the writing conference and the revising activity are related to each other. This graphic representation is a snapshot of the two connected activities within the broader network which entails other activities. They look static, however all the relationships among the activity systems in the network, and the relationships between the components within each activity system are all bi-directional and dynamic (Engestrom, 2001 € ). These two activities are not rigidly sequential but bilateral and interactive relationships. Given our account of dialogicality above, it is also likely that revising activity may have been occurring in the writers’ minds during the writing conference.

# 3.1. Tacit assumptions and practices and oral feedback exchange

As mentioned earlier, rules, community and the division of labour identified in the activities suggest writers’ tacit assumptions and practices (for more details about the activity systems of the groups, see Mochizuki, 2017). Through the students’ exchange of these tacit assumptions, the oral feedback exchanges were populated with various understandings of norms, conventions and practices regarding thesis writing and participants’ differing roles, social identity, agency as well as power relations shaped the exchanges and outcomes.

While group members discussed specific “rules” (Fig. 2) for language use in thesis writing such as academic writing conventions that students and the facilitators had encountered or learned in the past, disciplinary writing conventions that they were currently experiencing were their primary concerns. They sought to discover whether their writing would be accepted by more powerful members of their own disciplinary community such as supervisors, examiners or peer reviewers.

More specifically, the norms that students’ supervisors provided or implied were extremely influential as to language and rhetoric. The students and the facilitators often invoked and responded to the supervisor’s voice during the conference, saying, for example, “you better talk to your supervisor” (Yujin, Writing conference, October 21, 2014). Similarly, Danu initiated a discussion in the group on “how to write something critically” (Writing conference, October 21, 2014) because he perceived that this was what his supervisor found lacking in his writing. Yujin said she was most concerned about how to structure logical arguments when reading and giving feedback to others on their writing (Interview, October 18, 2014) as her supervisors had criticised her writing for an absence of logical argument.

Tacit assumptions and practices concerning thesis supervisor and examiners’ “rules” and “roles” are also articulated during the conference. Their views are clearly more powerful in the community through “the division of labour” (Fig. 2). In the exchange below, the supervisory voice and the examiner voice of authority are brought into the group by Alice as she draws attention to expectations of a potential future examiner and stresses the importance of being aware of these. In fact, Alice frequently encouraged the students in Groups B and C to think about their future examiners, as she saw them as, in many ways, the primary audience for their writing. The excerpt below from a Group B meeting illustrates how the examiner voice “enters” the meeting and how the students’ become aware of the variability of the examiners’ expectations as to what may need to be “explained”. In this exchange, the authority of the supervisor is also brought into focus as Alice defers to the supervisor voice. She suggests to Barbara that she needs a more specific explanation because the reader will not necessarily be an expert in her area of research. Barbara, however, thinks her explanation was clear enough for her readers (Turn 1, Turn 3). Seemingly unconvinced by Barbara’s response, Alice then recommends that Barbara ask her supervisor whether the specificity of her explanation would satisfy a future reader (examiner) of her thesis (Turn 4). Yong, another student, then continues to emphasise the importance of this issue, pointing to the possibility that what a writer takes for granted or presupposes, that is, what seems “second nature” might not be so to “other people” (Turn 6, Turn 8) demonstrating his own awareness of an audience or readership both within and outside of the group. Alice takes up and expands on Yong’s words (“those people”, Turn 10) identifying the “other people”; and “some people” as “more powerful others” (see above), that is future examiners. The norms and conventions, derived from the perceived authority of supervisors and examiners were thus very “present” in the writing groups as participants imagined the identity and the perspectives of future readers and how these readers might, in turn, construct the voice of the author.

1. Barbara: So usually everybody can go back and read the method and most people would probably know the standard procedure. So yeah, I could point …   
2. Alice: I don’t know. So you’re saying that people who are reading this will already know it so when they read what you did they will understand how it was modified from the original.   
3. Barbara: That’s what you hope right [laughs].   
4. Alice: Okay. That’s something for you to check with your supervisor, to what extent you need to explicitly clarify how you modified the original.   
5. Barbara: Okay.   
6. Yong: Sometimes some techniques we use seem like second nature to us but to other people they might not even get it.   
7. Barbara: Mm.   
8. Yong: Because we use it every day and we’re like oh yeah, obviously it’s using this but there are some people who don’t know that.   
9. Barbara: Mm.   
10. Alice: It depends on how widely you’re hoping this will be read. If it’s going to be read by totally insiders and you know that those who - like examiners are going to be those people and you can be very confident you write for that kind of readership. But if you can’t be confident, and many of us can’t, exactly how expert that examiner will be and we make it broader. (Writing conference, November 25, 2014)

As shown in “the division of labour” in Fig. 2, the tasks - giving, receiving and responding to feedback - inside the writing conferences were divided according to individuals’ various positions in the community, sometimes reflecting power relations associated with social identities, such as the reader-writer, expert-novice in academic writing, native-non-native speakers, facilitator-students, examiner-students, senior-junior students according to their stages of candidature, and their desired future social identity. How the students gave and responded to feedback was especially influenced by certain identities that they came to engage in or that were sometimes ascribed by other members of the group during the conference, such as “teacherly” identity, disciplinary identity, and silent-student identity. Richard and Barbara, for example, both had teaching experience and tended to give feedback to other group members in a teacher-like manner. For Barbara, providing feedback meant providing information and instruction and then letting group members make decisions for themselves (Interview, December 15, 2014) so that, as the extract below indicates, the next time they encountered a similar task, they could complete it independently.

Barbara: Yeah and you can tell by paragraphs you formed, so you have the demography and work roster first, work environment, another work environment chapter - paragraph. So I think the way you structured it was good because it’s clear which data you are telling. It’s probably just how you display this data. So you give ranges, for example the first one is line seven, ranges of ages and then you give the average and then you give the standard deviation I guess - SD4.

Hadaf: Yes.

Barbara: So you probably would write this a bit differently. I don’t know how this is normally done in your field, but … (Writing conference, November 14, 2014)

At the same time, Barbara ultimately defers to the perceived authority of the disciplinary voice e “normally done in your field”. Disciplinarity was regularly explicitly enacted as powerful in the division of labour in the oral feedback exchanges in the writing conferences. The facilitators repeatedly reminded the students of the importance of discipline-specific ways of writing and thinking and feedback from group members from different disciplinary backgrounds regularly acknowledged the existence of disciplinary differences. This may be particularly important if students’ prior experiences of writing instruction have been largely generic. Suggestions often included expressions that showed the disciplines to be the ultimate arbiter, “I don’t know your field, but …” (Amy, Writing conference, November 4, 2014); “So disciplines do things differently … You’re going to have to look and see what’s the normal practice …” (Alice, Writing conference, November 25, 2014). Over the course of the group meetings, students came to position themselves as representatives of their discipline, voicing and prioritising disciplinary conventions as they articulated their views on their own writing.

In addition to their previous identities, students’ imagined future identities also shaped interactions in the writing groups. Having already submitted her thesis, and while awaiting her examination results, Yujin brought the drafts of the journal articles she was writing from her thesis to the writing group. In her imagined future context, having publications was vital if she were to get an academic job in “one of English-speaking countries”. Her priority was therefore to get published, and this affected not only her perceptions of rules as to what to write about and how to address the topic but also what to say about other students’ writing and how to respond to comments from others on her own writing. In disagreeing with feedback provided on her writing, she “ventriloquated” the imagined expectations of prospective journal article reviewers mediated through advice from her supervisor. For example, in one of her drafts, she intentionally avoided identifying two groups of people by their gender in order to reduce the likelihood of potential reviewers relating the article to gender issues as these were not part of her chosen journal’s scope. When Alice and another student suggested that she explicitly address these two groups (men and women), we see how, for Yujin, the voices of the supervisor and of the imagined reviewer outrank Alice and fellow students:

I really like your advice and I mean I generally would agree with your suggestion but I mean for some reason - I mean my supervisor has told me that you know what, once you’re talking about these people, I mean the men versus woman, well automatically [the reviewer] thinks that - I mean the - this is about the feminist study, yeah so [laughs] (Yujin, Writing conference, October 21, 2014).

Yujin’s imagined future social identity as “published author” played a major role, in how she exchanged oral feedback as well as in her writing. She prioritized the specific effects of her writing over the clarity of her text. She did not want her paper to sound like a “feminist study” because she believed the reviewers of her targeted journal would not accept it. When her supervisors later suggested another journal whose scope would better match her article, Yujin changed her choice of target journal. She then revised the paper along the lines suggested earlier by the writing group members as she no longer needed to fear sounding like a feminist study. These experience of various positions and power relationships, mediated through the oral exchanges in the writing group, provided the students with opportunities to better understand and negotiate the academic worlds in which they needed to succeed.

Through their engagement in the dialogic oral interactions discussed above, students experienced and negotiated the power inherent in the social structures, value systems and ideologies that shape scholarly writing, particularly doctoral writing. The conference was, therefore, not only an opportunity to obtain specific advice on writing but also a space where students became aware of thesis writing as a social practice. As they discussed each other’s writing, they engaged dialogically with the voices of more powerful readers - their supervisors, imagined journal article reviewers and potential examiners of their thesis. To some extent, then, the paradox of writing (see above) can be resolved.

In the following section we discuss the role of oral feedback exchange in students’ revising.

# 3.2. Oral feedback exchange and voice construction in revising

When students engaged in revising outside of the writing group, the dialogues between students and facilitators from the group seemed to be re-enacted in the writers’ own consciousness. In other words, the inter-psychological dialogue (between individuals) during the writing conference became intra-psychological (internal to the self) in the revising activity as per our earlier discussion of hidden dialogicality. As shown in Fig. 2, revising is also an activity which is mediated by rules and the division of labour in that, as they revise their texts, students consider their own understandings of rules, community and the division of labour in the activity system. Revising can thus be understood as a multivoiced activity that enables the writer to make decisions for voice construction. The oral feedback exchanges have broadened the writer’s perspectives on social and ideological structures, informing the writer’s choices as to what to include, respond to or exclude in revising the text. A student may, for example, decide to prioritise their disciplinary voice. In an interview, David felt strongly that whether or not to take up suggestions from the group depended on his and/or his supervisor’s disciplinary decisions. He had a close relationship with his supervisor and submitted his writing to him for feedback and editing each week. His area was geology and none of the other group members had any expertise in this field. To David, it was thus obvious whose suggestions he should follow when dealing with discipline-specific matters in his revisions. Similarly, Amy invoked a disciplinary identity and set of rules - her field e as shaping her revision activity. Asked about the feedback she received in the group on a specific expression used in her writing, she said:

To be honest, I may not make that change because … I think this is more about ..more about a question in my field. So I have to make decision by myself. (Amy, Interview, December 14, 2014).

In revising, the relationship with the supervisor was also central to decision making. Supervisors’ suggestions were likely to be prized more highly than those of others when the students were evaluating feedback given to them. Amy emphasised this strongly, “I do feel like the feedback I got from my supervisor and co-supervisor is more important, because they are in my field and they have been engaging in my work from the very beginning”. When it was suggested in the conference that she rephrase the title of her thesis, she decided not to change it, saying, “I think because my supervisors don’t have any problems with that title” (Amy, Interview, December 14, 2014).

The question may be asked as to why, if disciplinary voice from outside the writing group was so influential, students joined the group and felt so positively about it. It is important to understand the roles of other perspectives which were derived from the reader-writer division of labour in the writing conference. During the oral feedback exchanges, writers especially appreciated feedback that verbalised the reader’s understanding of the text; being able to see how their writing was understood by readers was identified as one of the chief reasons students joined a writing group. Students’ relations with their supervisors and their perceptions of the feedback from their supervisors on their writing varied, but they all wished to have readers who were not supervisors. The students wanted to know how other people, whose judgement would not affect their future academic lives, would understand what they wrote, before they sent it to their supervisors. Barbara said, “if they [group members] actually get what I’m doing. If they say ‘yes, we got what you’re doing’, then I’m actually quite happy because then I know I can give this to my professor …” (Barbara, Interview, November 18, 2014).

However, all the group members’ perspectives were not treated equally during the revising activity. How the writer perceived their readers’ roles and statuses during the conference often led to the attribution of authority to particular feedback. The expert-novice division, for example, gave authority to an expert’s feedback. Hoa acknowledged the authority of the facilitator’s comments in terms of her extensive experience of teaching academic writing and her native-speaker status and prioritized her feedback over those students who were at the same stage as herself. When asked how she responded to the feedback she received from different members of the group, she said:

Alice is a lot of … very experienced. I will treat her feedback seriously, in terms of working with different types of thesis. Then I know if she says it is not coherent, then it is a really matter. (…) Those people who are at the same stage as me, I think it’s good to know different perspectives, but if they … if their opinions are different from you, it doesn’t mean that you have to so much worry about (Hoa, Interview, November 17, 2014).

In revising, the juxtaposition of various perspectives on thesis writing facilitated the writer’s decision making for voice construction. The development of voice was also facilitated by a new perspective on one’s own voice, gained through the exchanging of feedback; students seemed to gain clarity as to how they would like to present themselves textually. In Hoa’s case, this led to a realisation that she did not want to represent herself to her imagined readers with a “complicated” academic voice. She perceived Yujin’s writing style as rhetorically too complicated saying, “I don’t want to sound so complicated, of course I can’t write to that level, but I don’t want to sound that complicated as in Yujin’s writing, I don’t know why. That’s the sense” (Hoa Interview, November 17, 2014). She added:

so I just tell myself, well you think about your audience when you write, that will be good, maybe how audience [unclear] to that type writing, my audience may be not. I should keep it simple and clear, of course she [Yujin] is clear but a little bit more complex (Hoa, Interview, November 17, 2014).

Through reading the work of another group member and considering her response to it, she was able to develop a new understanding of herself as a writer in relation to her readers.

Through dialogic interactions both in the conference and in the revising activity, the writer comes to consider feedback as perspectives from people’s lived experience which draw on their tacit assumptions and practices, roles, and positions in society. As students consider the thinking of the person who provided those comments, including what the person knows, how they know it, and why they have made such comments, they make decisions about their own text in their own context. The revising activity enables an embodied, dialogic construction of voice, involving the orchestration of different voices so that writers gain new perspectives on their own writing leading to the further development of their text.

# 4. Discussion and conclusion

Our study demonstrates the potential of oral feedback exchange as pedagogy in voice construction. Through activity systems analysis, our study has provided a graphic representation (see Fig. 2) that illustrates the processes of social and dialogic voice construction through the exchange of oral feedback in group writing conferences. Group writing conferences provide the space for an inter-psychological activity: a space for various voices to intersect through participants’ exchange of feedback on writing. In the process of revising, these experiences enrich the writer’s intra-psychological dialogues, helping them renegotiate their voice aided by processes of hidden dialogicality. Xu and Zhang’s study (2019) also shows that dialogic interactions with other people and their ideas assist students’ decision taking in their thesis writing and they call for institutions to provide opportunities for doctoral students to communicate with members of their discourse community. Our study goes some way to explaining how group writing conferences can facilitate development in the inter-psychological plane for voice construction and it has identified opportunities that institutions need to consider adopting.

In terms of inter-psychological activity, the study focused on how students’ dialogic processes in their social worlds mediate the writing conference activity. Dialogic interactions can facilitate discourse acquisition (Haneda & Wells, 2008), and our study highlights the relationships between dialogic interactions and voice construction in particular. The study identified specific rules and divisions of labour that could mediate the activity and provide the experience of thesis writing as social practice. Through experiencing various values, practices, and ideologies during the oral feedback exchanges, writers reflected on how they were positioned in relation to the multiple populations that “inhabit” their discursive community; they learned to anticipate future readers and came to see how they would like their writing to be received and judged by those readers. While some previous studies have explored voice as the relationship between a discourse and its subject positions (e.g. Prior, 1998), this study has deepened the analysis of those relationships through the lenses of rules and the division of labour. The identified rules and divisions of labour, disciplinary conventions, supervisors’ voice and social identities associated with roles and positions in society will assist in connecting social structures and pedagogies for voice construction.

The study also sheds new light on the dialogic interactions in revising activities, where intra-psychological social activity is taking place. A Bakhtinian understanding of dialogism, and hidden dialogicality helps us see that “revision”, rather than being viewed as a solo, individualised activity, is ultimately an intensely social activity, as language is always “populated-overpopulated-with the intentions of others” (Bakhtin, 1981, p. 294). In the writing group, students momentarily enter the social contexts of others as they give and receive feedback: “it is from there that one must take the word, and make it one’s own” (Bakhtin, 1981, p. 294). Revising activities provide a space and time for writers to go “there” as they navigate the feedback they have received and consider how they may appropriate the words of others as they build an academic voice. In the course of the intra-psychological dialogic interactions in the revising activity, the writer’s unique voice is constructed through their orchestration of the multiple voices that populate their context.

Tardy (2012) noted that “classroom-based studies of voice may help to shed more light on pedagogical techniques that aid students in developing control over their written identities” (p. 359). Thesis writing groups are not exactly classrooms, but oral feedback exchange is a technique that is often used in L2 writing classrooms (Hyland & Hyland, 2019). The thorough investigation of how oral feedback exchange contributes to pedagogical affordances in a context of group learning can provide more specific as well as practical suggestions for developing pedagogies for voice construction in classroom contexts. Whereas previous studies have suggested that the teacher’s role in voice construction can facilitate students’ learning via, for example, enabling students’ turning classroom ecologies into pedagogical affordances (Canagarajah, 2015) or providing instruction as to how to incorporate spoken resources into voice construction (Zacharias, 2020), our study suggests specifically what the teacher could do to facilitate students’ learning from oral feedback in group writing conferences.

First, writing facilitators should enable each student to reflect on and understand the rules and divisions of labour to which each of them is currently responding, such as disciplinary conventions, supervisors’ voice, and social identities associated with roles and positions in society. During the oral feedback exchange, the teacher/facilitator should encourage not only the exchange of feedback on writing but also the exchange of each student’s social worlds. This could be facilitated during writing conferences by encouraging both readers and writers to reflect on and explain their thinking processes as they write. Specifically, during the feedback exchange, when giving feedback on someone’s paper, students should be encouraged to give reasons as to why they give such feedback, and, when receiving feedback on their own paper, they should be encouraged to explain their writing choices. By so doing, students will, in all likelihood, refer to their own intentions and purposes for writing and identify the mediation of rules and the divisions of labour in their own contexts as Hoa did when she gained a new understanding of her role as a writer and the relationships she would like to establish with future readers.

Secondly, the pedagogy should be designed so that oral feedback exchange is followed by intra-psychological activity such as revising based on the feedback given during the writing conference or reflection on the experience of writing conferences. Through these two stages of inter and intra-psychological activity, individuals are afforded the opportunity to explore their own voice. It is important that the facilitator explicitly show students how to go through these stages, specifically, how to incorporate spoken resources (oral feedback) into one’s own voice construction. The study suggests modelling two types of intra-psychological dialogic processes: the orchestration of different voices for the sake of one’s “own” voice and hearing one’s “own” voice through the juxtaposition of different voices.

This study further contributes in that it has identified the potential of an activity systems analysis for voice studies. As shown above, the use of activity systems sheds new light on the connections between social structure and pedagogy. This was made possible because the analysis allowed a new perspective on voice construction, namely, the student’s voice construction as an integration of their cognitive activity, their social activities in past, present, and future-imagined contexts, and the ideological structures of the larger society. Simply examining learners’ participation and performance in writing conferences is unlikely to reveal their learning and development of voice, because individuals’ intentions and purposes for writing do not necessarily exist only within the classroom but emerge outside of it too, and their learning does not start or end during the writing conferences but continues from the past towards the future. Activity systems analysis will assist voice researchers in moving across the boundaries that classrooms impose. These findings should not be seen as limited to the unique context of advanced writing groups such as those described in the paper, the processes of voice construction discussed above have relevance for a wide range of pedagogical settings where students engage in peer review. Student writers who practice situated writing at different levels, undergraduate or master’s students, should all benefit from developing greater awareness of writing as social practice.

It should however be noted that this study’s findings are drawn from a case study of a relatively small number of students in three thesis writing support groups consisting of five sessions per group, and the findings may not be generalisable to other contexts. Moreover, the focused context of voice negotiation was limited to the context of doctoral and master’s thesis writing through writing conferences within the Australian higher degree research context.

Despite the limitations raised above, the study highlights new aspects of the complex processes involved in dialogic and social voice construction and suggests new areas of research into voice construction. Our hope is that, with the use of activity systems analysis, future voice research could suggest localised and situated pedagogies that support postgraduate writers to live through scholarly writing as social practice.
