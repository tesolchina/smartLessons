Students around the world are expected to read, comprehend and learn from growing numbers of English texts in higher educational contexts where the official medium of instruction is the local language. Despite this language shift, relatively little attention has been paid to the challenges academic texts in English present for students. The present paper provides insights into first-year university students' perceptions of and attitudes towards academic reading in English in Sweden through a sequential explanatory design with questionnaires and follow-up interviews. Sweden is often seen as a model country in terms of second-language proficiency in English, but as this study shows, a majority of first-year university students expressed negative attitudes towards academic reading in English. Student responses suggested more than one third of first-year Swedish university students in social science subjects struggled to comprehend and keep up with their assigned reading, with vocabulary and reading speed cited as their biggest challenges. This paper further shows that a considerable number of students entered higher education unaware that they were going to be required to read academic texts in English, with some questioning this common practice. Finally, implications for teachers are discussed.

# 1. Introduction

The use of English has been gaining ground in numerous educational contexts where another language was previously used (Gabriels & Wilkinson, 2021). In an ever-globalised society, students are expected to read, comprehend, and learn from growing numbers of English texts in higher educational settings where the oficial medium of instruction is the societal language (i.e., not English). The importance of academic reading is widely acknowledged, but compared to academic writing, there is ittle previous research on reading for academic purposes in tertiary education (Maguire et al., 2020), particularly on students' experiences of aademic reading in a foreign language during their undergraduate studies.

Sweden, a Nordic country in northern Europe that is the site of this study, has "consistently been at the forefront of the process of Englishization (Gustafsson & Valcke, 2021, p. 215) over the past three decades and generally rans amongst the top countries in the world on English proficiency tets (Dafouz & Smit, 2020). As a reading language, English has been used frequently in higher education for several decades (Kuteeva, 2014; Malmstrom & Pecorari, 2022; Pecorari et al., 2011; Salo0, 2010). English is an integral part of university ducation in Sweden and beyond, and as such a certain level of English proficiency is asumed. However, in reality, the shit towards English has resulted in new challenges for students because "assumed proficiency does not always match the actual proficiency of the individuals involved Busby, 2020, p.7) If this is a issue in weden, one of the highest ranked countres in the world on

English proficiency test, it can be assumed that i is also an issue in ther parts of the world where students ae esslikely to have the proficiency required to read English-language publications.

Academic reading research has demonstrated that undergraduate students struggle to met reading requirements at universty (Ismayilli Karakoc et al., 2022). However, outside of the Nordic context, most previous research has been conducted in English-speaking countre. For example, undergraduate students have expressed concens related to reading, especiall i relation to being able to cope with the reading load under time presure (Weir e al., 2009), reported difficulties reading academic texts (Gravat et a., 1998) and sigificantly lower confidence reading journal articles than textboos (St Clair-Thompson et al., 2018). In one of the few studies focused on academic reading in English at university in a context where the oficial medium of instruction is another language, engineering students in Thailand were shown to have great dfficult reading textboos in English, impacting both their learning and their motivation to learn because the texts were \*just too difficult' (Ward, 2001, p. 150).

Reading in contexts where English is an L2 is partcularly challenging for students in their first year when academic emotions play a major role. Positive academic emotions and optimism have been shown to \*correlate with academic suces, while negative academic emotions can have the opposite effct" (Perander et al., 2020, p. 2). The participants in this study are frst-year students in Swedish-medium instruction programmes. On these programmes, the language of instruction and interaction in course metings is generally wedsh, but the assgned redings ae tovarying extents, in Eglish. The study is part f a larger project which inolves data from both upper secondary chools and universies in wede (se Eriksson, 2023), and reort on the full xtent of wedsh university students' perceptions and attitudes towards academic reading in English.

# 1.1. Aims and research questions

Unlike higher education institutions (HEI) in many other countries, an English proficiency test score is not required for universty admission at Nordic HEIs (Busby, 2020), who instead depend on upper secondary schoos to provide students with the necessary skill. HEIs take it for granted that Nordic students have the ability to read for academic purposes in English without support (Arnbjornsdottir 2018), an assumption that may be tenuous. The potential impact on student retention and academic success means there is a need for more attention to be paid to students' experiences with reading. The present paper aims to ilustrate the issue by discussng universt students perceptions of and atitudes towards academic reading in English through its sequential explanatory design (Creswel et al., 2003) with questonnaire and follow-up interviews. The study adress the following research questions:

1. What perceptions do first-year university students in Sweden have of their a) preparation for, and b) ability to read for academic purposes in English?   
2. Do first-year universty students in Sweden report challenges in relation to English reading materials and if o, what chllenges do they report?

# 2. Contextualising the study

The gradual expansion of English in research and publishing has led to more than $9 0 \%$ of indexed social science journals and $9 5 \%$ of natural science ournals to be only or partially Englis-language publications (Dafouz, 2020). In smallr countries, publishing textbooks in local languages is often financially prohibitive (Arnbjornsdotir, 2018. As a result, it can be ifficult for teachers in higher education to avoid assgning texts written in English when creating reading lists. These reading is primaril consist of textbooks, chapters in edited volumes, and journal atce, ut can also include conference proceedings, reports, manuals, policy documents, and other relevant materials. Research on reading for academic purposes in higher education should thus not be limited to textboos only as it would not provide the complete context. In this article, I adopt a brod view of reading lits and deine academic texs as all texts that fulfil a purpose of education in university.

Prior to entering higher education, the typical Swedish student has attended compulsory school for ten years (year 0-9) and upper secondary chool for three year (year 1012). The syllabus for English in upper secondary chool isdivided into thee courses: English 5, 6 and 7. Learners start studying English formally before the age of nine, with two thirds of Swedish learners achieving a B2 level in reading comprehension in the European Survey on Language Competences 2011 (Skolverket, 2012) in their final year of compulsory school (i.e., year 9). The Swedish National Agency for Education (Skolverket) prepares knowledge requirements for schools, which involve explicit goals for compulsory school such as being able to read instructions, descriptions, newspaper artice, and novels in English (Skolverket, 2022a).

In order to be eligible for universty studies laners must continue to upper secondary school. New curricul for both compulsory schoo (Lgr11) and upper secondary school (Gy 2011) were implemented in 2011. Oneof the major change i the new curriculum was the requirement for two years of English in upper secondary chool for university eligibility, compared to just one year previously. A third year of English is optional but generates a credit increment that makes it easier for the aplicant to be admitted to university. Each upper secondary course has it own set of content which hould be covered, as well s its own grading criteria. As sen in Table 1, the syllabus for the two mandatory course focuses on subject areas such as current and ethical isues, and texts such as manuals, formal letters and popular science texts.

When the vast majority of the participants in this study attended upper secondary schol, content such as theoretical and complex subject areas, also of a more scientific nature" and \*in-depth articles and scientific texts" was not inroduced until English 7 (Skol) verket, 2011), which is the optional course given in the final year of upper secondary chool. As a result, a large proportion of first-year university students are likely to have ittle experience reading academic English, which could affct their studies negatively

# 3. Literature review

Reading for academic purposes is an integral part of higher education and previous research has shown a strong corrlation be tween reading proficiency and succes among undergraduate students (e.g., Brost & Bradey, 2006; Fatiloro et al, 2017). Yet in L1 contexts, around hal of university students do not complete their required reading (Aagaard et al., 2014) because of lack of preparation and/or motivation, time constraints, and an underestimation of the importance f reading (Maguire et l., 2020). In order to succeed in higher education, reding comprehension alone i not suficient Students aoeed to have the skils required to be able to engage critically with the texts on ther reding lists, demonstrate their critical thinking in ssiments, and construct auments based on their readings in essays (Ismayilli Karakoc et al., 2022).

In an L2 setting, students are often expected to read the same texts as L1 users even though reading in an L2 \*imposes a number of additional constraints on reading and its development (Grabe, 199, p. 11). These constraints include, but are not limited to the use of counterproductivestratgie such as excessive dictionary use, diffiulty gusing the grammatical function f unfamiliar words from context, and the need for aditional cognitive processes which are required to make up for a lack of automatic rcognition of words (Hellekjaer, 2009). Vocabulary knowledge in particular is a critical component for fluency, and has been described as the greatest single impediment to fluent reading by ESL students (Grabe, 1988, p. 63).Students who read more have been shown to outperform students who read les on all aspects of academic language, including vocabulary, spelling, reading and writing (Krashen & Brown, 2007). The impact on the development of academic language as well as on content learning is thus greatly afected if students do not engage with their required reading.

In the Nordic context, around one third of universty students in Iceland and Norway were found to be struggling with academic English text (Asdotir, 2018; Hlekjr, 2009). In Dmark, universit cturers have expresthat studnts are \*sor of taken aback'" (Dimova, 2020, p. 8) when they realize the difference between general and academic English. Nordic scholars have further suggested the English taught in schoos has not kept up with the changing role of English in the Nordic countries (Arnbjornsdottir, 2018, p. 145), thereby impacting students' experiences with academic reading in English in higher education.

In Sweden, a recent report found that nearly half of the required reading on undergraduate courses with Swedish as the oficial language of instruction is now in English (Malmstrom & Pecorari, 202) despite reports that a majorit of undergraduate students said they undersood les when the textbook was in English, and that moreffort was required to read in English than in Swedish (Pecorari et a., 2011). In the same study, more than four in fie students expressed a negative atitude towards English textbooks, although only $4 4 \%$ said they would not choose English textbooks if the choice was theirs. In Mezek (2013), reading speed in English was perceived as an issue by students in biology and correlated with vocabulary knowledge. Biology students also had trouble learning English subject-specific terminology. However, if iven extra time, both Shaw and McMillio (2008) and Mezek (2013) found that Swedish universt students in biology performed at asimilar leel to that of British 1 stdents. Finll, Arey (2009) found that some first-year students had considerable ifficulties speaking about disciplinary concepts in English; however, his investigation focused on students experience attending lectures rather than reading, which is the focus of the current study.

# 4. Material and methods

The data for this study were collcted from three universties in Sweden in 2021 after pilot testing. A total of 23 programmes in behavioural and social ciences a the three universties were identified during a systematic review of reading lis. For inclusion in the study, the elected programmes al fulflled a set criterion of a minimum of one textbook or three journal arties in English during the first term of the programme but had Swedish listed as the official medium of instruction in the programme syllabus. This consistency measure was important to ensure validity s self-asessment items need to be based upon task content tied to students' situations as potential users of the language in question' (Bachman, 1990, p. 148). Universty teachers were contacted with information about the study, with 16 programmes opting to participate. A questionnaire was distributed tostudents in their first year on the participating programmes during alecture or aseminar (se section 4.1). After the questionnaires had bencollected, twelve students participated in follow-up interviews (section 4.2). Participating students received no compensation for taking part in the study.

# 4.1. Student questionnaire

The questionnaire was designed to include demographic, closed-ended and open-ended items, and consisted of 54 questions. Example questions have been included in Appendix 1. To ensure a reasonably high response rate, the questionnaire was designed and constructed in Survey&Report (Version 4.3; Artlogik 2019) so that it could be flled out online during or ater a lecture or seminar. Multiple-choice questions using Likert scales were used in adition to a small number of open-ended questions which allowed participants to provide more detail. Questions which invoke the episodic memory of specific skill is one of the best bases for self. assesment (Ross, 1998), and in this study, questions were formulated so that the participants would be required to remember pat personal experiences such as times and associated emotions, which are properties of the episodic memory (Clayton et al. 2007) Furthermore, the questionnaire was constructed in Swedish to not exclude students who had dificultie reading or responding in English.

The questionnaire was pilot tsted on more than 50 students to ensure that all questions were easy to understand, and that the questionnaire could be filled out in about $1 0 \ \mathrm { m i n }$ . Questionnaire items included in this paper focused on two themes: perceptions of their ability to read for academic purposes in English and reading speed. The questionnaire was introduced and distriuted to students in person by the author to try to reduce elf-selection bias, but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, lectures and seminars were held in Zoom, which may have affected the response frequency as detailed in Table 2.

The data from the demographic items show that most of the participants were female $( n = 1 5 7$ $7 7 \%$ .1 The youngest participant was 18 years old and the oldest 46, with a median age of 21 (mean $. = 2 3 . 2$ $S D = 4 . 9$ ), which is similar to the median age for first-year students in allsubjects which was 21.4 in 2021/22 (Soderman, 2022). Most students were first-year students $n = 1 6 5$ $8 1 \%$ who had Swedish as an L1 $\mathbf { \tilde { \it { n } } } = 1 9 3$ 3 $9 4 \%$ ) and had attended their entire schooling in Sweden $( n = 1 9 8$ $9 6 \%$ ). The closed-ended questionnaire items are presented using descriptive statistics, whil the open-ended questionnaire items were analysed in NVivo using conventional approach to content analysis with inductive category development (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005). For example, the first question in the questionnaire aske studens about thir atitudes towards asigned text in English. In total, 318items from 198 openedd resonses were coded (see section 5.1 for examples) and sorted into three categories during analysis: positive, negative and neutal atitudes.

# 4.2. Follow-up interviews

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve students who had responded to the questionnaire and opted to ill i their e-mail when asked if they would be wiling to participate in an interview on the same topic. The first three questions included in the interview protocol, which were used as a starting point for the interviews, were the following:

1. How did it feel when you received the first text in English at university? Do you remember what it was like? 2. Did you know that you would be required to read texts in English when you started university? 3. In the questionnaire you said that you felt prepared/did not fel prepared to read assigned litrature in English when you started university. Can you tell me a bit more about that?

The interview participants represented all three universities and reflected the demographic data of the student questionnaire in regard to gender, age and time pent in higher education. Participants were asked to give oral consent to the interviews being recorded. The interviews resulted in $2 1 6 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ of data which were later transcribed by the author. The interview transcripts were then analysed using qualitative content analysis.

# 5. Results

The questionnaire was designed to provide direct measures of student attitudes and self-reported behaviour regarding reading for academic purposes in English. The sequential explanatory design (Creswellet al., 2003) with fllow-up interviews complements the questionnaire results and provides opportunities for exploring the quantitative results in more detail (Ivankova et al., 2006). This section gives the responses for four ars: atitudes towars asiged texts in nlish, peceived prearednes for reading for aademic purposes in English, challenges involved in reading for academic purposes, and reading speed.

# 5.1. Attitudes towards assigned reading in English

The frst research question asked what perceptions first-year universty students in Sweden have of their preparation for and ability to read for academic purposes in English. In the questionnaire, participants wereasked how they felt when they saw a text in English on their reading list. Thirty-nine items $( 1 2 \% )$ were categorised as positive attitudes, and included codes such as fun, international and preparatory for the future. Sixty-two items $( 2 0 \% )$ were categorised as neutral attitudes, of which 43 items were coded as nothing/

# anything special. This comment was typical of the code:

<html><body><table><tr><td>P12</td><td>othn sil, do qut qk ht  rit  wht w g    in nis.  dont hen ma  wt m gs so it dosn&#x27;t cse  ie nio.  r  tak  i t   x ic cn ish h, u si have a feeling of that the page numbers do not correspond to the normal reading time a Swedish text would result in.</td></tr></table></body></html>

Whilst s ome respondents simply wrote that they did notfeel anything pecial when they saw English texs on their course reading lists, many started by tating they did not feelanything pecial ut later conceded that cademic texts in English were more dificult or took longer to read compared to Swedish. The remaining 217 items ( $7 6 8 \% ]$ were categorised as negative attitudes. These included codes such as annoying, difficult, stressed, panic, and time-consuming. Responses included the following:

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2">P2</td><td>Ifel t f  a et, a    t th ih  in atr of  ti</td></tr><tr><td>text, but despite this I often times cannot keep up at all and understand what it really says.</td></tr><tr><td>P3</td><td>I usually fel tired, its gruelling to read in English despite my knowledge in it being very good. It works, but I prefer Swedish.</td></tr><tr><td>P4</td><td>I feel very unsure of how it will go, frustrated that I will not learn as much as I would have if it had been in Swedish.</td></tr><tr><td>P5</td><td>Ithink: damn it, horrible, eels very hard and difficult to get through and understand, very time-consuming, especially scientific artices.</td></tr><tr><td>P6</td><td>At first I was indifferent, but gradually it has turned into a bit of anxiety as you have to focus more on the language than the content.</td></tr></table></body></html>

As seen in the response from P3, even students who perceived themseles to be good at English expressed negative atitudes to academic texts in English. This also includes students who had the highest possble grades in the optional English 7 course in upper secondary school, $5 1 \%$ $\displaystyle n = 1 9$ of whom responded that seeing a text in English on their reading list made them feel it would be more demanding and time-consuming, and in the case of some, such as P2 and P6, angst-ridden.

The gradual increase in anxiety mentioned by P6 and use of various avoidance strategies were mentioned by a small number of students in the data $( n = 6$ $3 \%$ . In one of the interviews, one student elaborated on their answer and said that despite being almost a year into the programme, they avoided reading English texts to the greatest extent possble. As an example, the student discussed a final essay they were working on which required searching a database for previous research. The student said even though they knew there is more and perhaps better information in the English research available, they only searched for journal articles written in Swedish. In contras, aslightl larger number of students mentioned in their reponses that reading assigned texts in English had gotten easier with time ( $\scriptstyle { \mathcal { n } } = 1 4$ $7 \%$ , which perhaps suggests some of these students had been able to overcome the additional constraints imposed by reading in an L2 and develop their academic language.

# 5.2. Perceived preparedness for reading assigned texts in English

The first research question also asked what perceptions first-year university students in Sweden have of their preparatio for reading for academic purposes in English. In response to a question concerning their perceived preparedness in the questionnaire, more than two in three students responded that they felt prepared $( n = 1 3 9$ $6 8 \%$ , as seen in Fig. 1.

However, almost one in three students responded they 'did not feel sufficiently prepared' $\mathtt { \Delta } n = 5 7$ $2 8 \%$ ) or 'did not feel prepared at all' $( n = 9$ $4 \%$ . Students were further asked how easy or difficult they thought it was to read the texts on their university reading lists on a five-point Likert scale, to which a slightly larger number of students ( $3 5 \%$ $n = 7 2$ ) said they thought reading assigned texts in English was 'quite difficult' or 'very difficult' compared to $6 \%$ $( n = 1 2$ ) in Swedish, as seen in Fig. 2.

In contrast, $3 6 \%$ $( n = 7 4$ of respondents said it was quite easy' or 'very easy' to read assigned texts in English, compared to $8 4 \%$ (n $= 1 7 2$ in Swedish, suggesting that a considerable number of students had a harder time reading in English than the fficial language of instruction.

In response to an open-ended question about preparedness, $1 5 \%$ $n = 2 0$ ) explained that they had said they felt prepared because they had been told to expect considerable reading in English, primarily from friends and family. This was confirmed by students i. interviews, as exemplified by P7:

Fig. 2. Student responses regarding how easy they think it is to read asigned texts at universty a) in English and b) in Swedish.

Similarly, $1 6 \%$ $( n = 1 0$ who said they did not feel prepared noted in their comments that this was because they were not aware they were going to be required to read in English. Several students wrote that their programme was supposed to be in Swedish, with some questioning the inclusion of texts in English.

Other explanations provided by the students as to why they did not feelprepared can be categorised in two groups: 1) insuficient knowledge of English in general, and 2) insufficient knowledgef academic English. Students in the firt group explained they were not good at English in general, that they rarely read in English or that they had not used English since they finished schoo several years ago. Students in the second group described how they were unfamiliar with academic texts in English and blamed \*bad teachers' in upper secondary schol. Students also explain that there was a large gap between the level of English taught in upper secondary school, which was described as "everyday English', and the level required at university.

# 5.3. Challenges involved in reading for academic purposes in English

The second research question asked if frst-year university students in Sweden report challenges in relation to English reading materials and if so, what challenges they report. Asked how often they had a hard time understanding the content when they read the English texts on their reading lists, $2 3 \%$ of the participants responded 'always' or 'often' $( n = 4 6$ , and an additional $4 6 \%$ 'sometimes' $( n = 9 5 )$ ) (Fig. 3).

Students were also asked how often they had issues with new vocabulary items when they were reading the English texts on their reading lists, to which $4 2 \%$ responded 'always' or 'often' $\mathbf { ( n = 8 5 ) }$ , and an additional $3 5 \%$ 'sometimes' $\mathbf { ( n = 7 2 ) }$ , with only $1 \%$ responding never'. Asked to explain in their own words what they thought was diffiult about readingassigned text in English, nearly two in three $( \mathbf { n } = 1 2 1$ $6 2 \%$ ) suggested vocabulary is the biggest issue. These comments were typical of the responses:

<html><body><table><tr><td>P8</td><td>You get bored because you haveto loo up so many words, th reading has no flow and hat makes ou tire. also t frstratd when feel ad&quot; at English.</td></tr><tr><td>P9</td><td>One is fored to look up words (&quot;normal&#x27; words, not technical terms) which makes i so that I have worse flow when reading.</td></tr><tr><td>P10</td><td>There are many words I don&#x27;t recognize. It takes an extra-long time to read. Sometimes I have to use Google.</td></tr></table></body></html>

Respondents noted issues with vocabulary obstructed reading fluency, making the reading more time-consuming $( n = 4 6$ $2 4 \%$

![](img/6166312ec4d385a7253f3cf6ede5422b2e296a17258b834d1b85a8454dbb1980.jpg)  
Fig. 3. Student responses regarding how often they struggled to understand the content when they read assgned texts at universit.

Respondents also wrote that the English texts on their reading ists required more concentration and as a result, made them tired. A smaller number of students $( n = 9$ $5 \%$ ) mentioned difficulties with sentence structure, as exemplified by this response:

<html><body><table><tr><td>P11</td><td>The sentence structure i omplicated and, in my opinion, very unnecessarily constructed. I understand that it&#x27;s academic texts but writing with a simple language should not be considered to be wrong.</td></tr></table></body></html>

In interviews, students explained that there was ascale of ifficulty amongst different text types and that it was primarily journal articles in glish that were chllenging, asen in P12, whers English textbooks provided a goo introduction to the subject, as seen in P13:

<html><body><table><tr><td>P12</td><td>Ihad t   i      o to the et ore, w xct</td></tr><tr><td>P13</td><td>but it&#x27;s the articles that are difficult. Tee hae m n the t t has  of tin tht ma   ty   ha  he is books.</td></tr></table></body></html>

English textboos provide examples without using too many technical terms. Students further emphasised that English textbooks were more pedagogical than Swedish textbooks, making them easier to read.

# 5.4. Reading speed

An additional challenge reported by students was reading speed. One question asked students in which language they perceive to read assigned texts faster. As seen in Fig. 5, $8 9 \%$ $( n = 1 8 3$ ) reported they read faster in Swedish than in English.

As previously mentioned in section 4.3, students reported that reading in English was time-consuming $n = 4 6$ $2 4 \%$ ) when they were asked what they thought was dificult about reading assgned texts in English. Student responses ranged widely from \*slightly Ionger to about 3 times as long Asked how often they had strggled to read their assigned reading on time during the previous term, which for most participants was their first term at university, $1 1 \%$ $n = 2 3$ ) said they 'always' struggled in English compared to just $1 \%$ $( n = 3 )$ in Swedish, as seen in Fig. 6.

The results shown in Fig. 6 suggest students perceived reading rate in English was not only an issue in the sense that it took them longer to read their assined reding, but that i took so much longer that almost one third frequenty struggled to ke up. This is also reflected in participant responses, with one student remarking the following:

This is especially concerning in light of the observation that $9 \%$ $( n = 1 8 )$ of respondents said they gave up and stopped reading if they did not understand a sentence or a paragraph in their assigned reading.

# 6. Discussion

The negative attitudes expressed, the reported issues comprehending assigned texts in English, the considerable amount of time required for reading them, and the avoidance strategies at least some of the participating students used undoubtedly had an impact on their quality of work for the course, such as group work, assignments, and exams, but most importantly on the quality of their learning (section 6.1 and 6.2). Considering that weden usuall ranks amongst the highest countrie in English proficiency in the world (Dafouz & Smit, 2020), it is not unreasonable to assume that the isues rased in this paper are impacting other countries where EAL learners have to red Eglish acadmic tx in higher ecation, and implications of th reults of this stud, with a fos on techer, conclude the paper (section 6.3).

# 6.1. Student attitudes and reading ability

A partial im of the present study was to investigate what perceptions students have of their preparation for and their bility to read academic texts at university. The ability to read and understand academic texts is one of the most important kills that EFL university students need to acquire (Nergis, 2013). Reading comprehension is essential to academic learning, but also to career success and lifelong learning in allsubject areas (Dreyer & Nel, 2003), but the findings of this study suggest more than one third of first-year Swedish university students in social science struggled to comprehend and keep up with their ssigned reading, which corresponds with Arnbjornsdotir's (2018) and Hellekjar's (2009) findings from two of the other Nordic countries.

Language learning is not an objective for the participating programmes in this study, but the overwhelmingly negative attitudes expressed by students in reation to reding for academic purposes in Englsh may impact their academic suces. This notion is n line with previous research which has sugested negative academic emotions correlate with por resuts (Perander et al., 2020). For example, stres has diruptive effcts on brain function and structure and is asociatd with alterations i cognitive proceses such as learning and memory (Pakulak et al., 2018), which i likely to impact content learning and knowledge retention. Optimal language learning conditions suggest ssigned reading should be slightly more dificult than the students current level of language proficiency ${ ( \mathrm { i \mathrm { ~ + ~ } 1 } }$ Krashen, 1982). However, in this case, it appears much of the assgned reading on social science programmes at Swedish universities presents students with input that is not fully comprehensible $( \mathbf { i } + 2$ or more), effectively hindering their language learning and disrupting their learning and motivation (Ward, 2001), resulting in the negative atitudes expressed in this paper.

In contrast with Pecorari et al. (2011), who found that negative comments outnumbered positive comments four to one, the negative comments expressed by the participants in this study $( 6 8 \% )$ were considerably lower. Since this study has only surveyed first-year students in social science programmes, it is possible student attitudes have not improved in general; however, it is also possible the implementation of two years of mandatory Englis in upper secondary school after Pecorari et al. (2011) colected their data has had a positive impact on student preparednessfor further education, somewhat improving their attitudes towards assigned texts in English. Further research on a larger population which includes students in other subject aeas and in ll three years of undergraduate studies i neessry in order to investigate students attitudes frther. Iely such a study would be longitudinal inature and investigat students peetions and attitudes at multiple occasions during their undergraduate studies to be able to identif ways in which students learn to adapt to academic texts in English. Such a study would be an important contribution as there are some indications that students adapt to studying in English after about one year of universty studies (e.g., Klassen, 2001). In the present study, a small number of students mentioned assigned reading in English had gotten asier with time. Airey (2009) similarly found that Swedish university students adapted to being taught in English, for example by beginning to read sections of the asigned literature before lectures. However, Airey also found that students adapted in ways that did not necessarily aid their learning, with some using lectures for mechanical note-taking while others ceased to take notes entirely in clas. Investigating how these adaptations affect learning is crucial for better understanding the implications of teaching and learning in a foreign language.

# 6.2. Challenges involved in reading academic English

The second research question asked if first-year university students in Sweden report challenges in relation to English reading materials and if o what challenges they report. The perceived differences in reading ped between Swedish and English was one of the most prevalent themes in the data, and in line with Hellekjaer (2005), a majority of the respondents said that they read slower in English than in Swedish. This is not surprising but may, in combination with their truggle to read their asigned texts in English on time, suggest that at least some of these students did not have issues with reading proficiency in general, but language-specific isues that affected their reading in English Slow reading speed can be an indication of procesing difficultie, with reading comprehension hindered by the imitations of our working memory (Grabe, 199). Previous research involving Swedish biology students found that the students performed at a similar level to that of British L1 students if they were given extra time Meek, 2013; Shaw & McMillion, 2008). Further studies involving students in social science and other areas are necessary; however, by considering the findings ofthis study and the additional constraints on reading imposed by reading in an L2, universty teachers should, at minimum, have strong arguments for adjusting the reading requirements.

Another prevalent theme in the data was vocabulary, which almost two in three participants reported as a challenge. Participants frequently mentioned needing to ook up or translate vocabulary items, indicating the use f counterproductie strategies associated with L2 reding, impacting not only their reading but also ther reading development (Grabe, 1999.Vocabulary knowledge is acritical component for fluency (Grabe, 1988) and by providing vocabulary support for students, content learning would likely improve. Participants further brought up that there was a perceived scale of difficulty amongst different text types. For at least some of the participating students, it was primaril jourl articles in English that provided a challenge, while Englishtextboos were seen as good introductions to the subject. This i line with St Clair-Thompson et al. (2018) who found university students were significantly less confident reading journal articles than textbooks, but further research is needed to investigate the impact of genre on students

experiences.

Academic reading is a hidden curriculum" without explicit academic reading instruction (Isakson & Isakson, 2017, p. 156). The findings of the present study suggest that the transition from upper secondary school to universty is complicated by the perceived gap between the level of English taught in uper secondary chool, which was described by some of the participants as everyday English', and the level required at university. Although the reported level of English taught can be placed in contrast with the current Swedish curriculum for the final mandatory English course which includes content such as complex and formal texts, novels and extracts from older pieces of literature, the currculum for English in upper secondary school lacks explicit guidance about timings and priorities when it comes to the use of class time to cover each of the elements" (Siegel, 2019, p. 267). Ambiguous steering documents allow teachers t \*put the syllabus into practice according to their own interpretations" (Siegel, 2019, p. 275), which may explain students experiences of everyday English in upper secondary school.

However, further research is needed to investigate why students report that teachers focus on everyday English. For example, teachers may believe everyday English is more useful for the students or that they are not prepared to learn academic nglish. Another possibility is that teacher training programmes have not provided teachers with sufficient training to teach academic English. Regardless the failure to introduce scientific texts, in-depth articles and theoretical subject areas in the obligatory English courses required for further education is asign that the curriculum has not kept up with the changing role of English in Sweden and elsewhere (see e.g., Arnbjornsdottir, 2018). A recent adition to the optional English course in Sweden, \*texts used in higher education) (Skolverket, 2022b), is a step in the right direction, but as the findings in the present study sugest it is likely not enough to prepare students to read academic texts in English at university.

# 6.3. Implications for teachers and conclusions

The results outlined in this paper indicate the need for university teachers to introduce English texts more graduall, allowing students to first become acquainted with subject ontent and terminology in their L1 before 1)inroducing textbooks in English, and 2) journal articles and other texts which have been written for an expert audience in line with student perceptions that journal articles are more challenging than textbooks (see also St Clair-Thompson et al. 2018). A gradual introduction of English may be hindered in some fields by a shortage of published works in the local language, particularly journal articles. However, considerable differences between the number of assgned texts in English have been identified at Swedish universties by Malmstrom and Pecorari (2022), with several universities assigning less than $2 5 \%$ of texts in English while others assign up to $6 5 \%$ in English. These differences indicate that at least some universitie could assign considerably larger amounts of texts in the local language than they do currently. Irespective of the amount of literature available in the local language, universty teachers may want to consider adjusting the number of pages assigned in an L2 compared with an L1. For example, formulas used by Abo Akademi and others in Finland that were first introduced by Karjalainen et al. (2006) involveassigning 10-12 pages per hour in the students irt language or for texts that are relatively easy to read but only 4-6 pages per hour in a foreign language or for texs that are difficult to read (Abo Akademi, 2022, p. 20). The transition from upper secondary school to university would likely also be made easier for students if diffculties with vocabulary in assigned readings in English were anticipated, as previously suggested by Shaw and McMillion (2011).

For English teachers in upper secondary school and EAP teachers, devoting time to improving students' reading fluency, for example through extensive reading and repeated exposure to vocabulary items from the Academic Word List (Coxhead, 2000) or subect-specific vocabulary lists (e.g., Coxhead & Hirsch, 2007; Wang et al., 2008; Ward, 2009), would possibly ease the transition from English classes to content learning at university. The impact of extensive reading in particular on reading achievement cannot e overlooked (Kirchhoff, 2013) and has been found to correlate with academic English reading proficiency (Hellekjer, 2005). Partici. pating students would likely also benefi from exposure to authentic textbooks and journal articles used in higher education, with a particular focus on strategies which help students read and understand journal rtices for example how journal article are commonly structured and what readers can expect to find in each section, how to differentiate between different types of journal articles, and what questions readers can ask themselves about the content while reading.

The lack of awareness some of the participating students expressed in relation to assigned reading in Swedish medium instruction programmes being in English is further cause for concern when considering the increasing amount of required reading in English. The lack of information provided not only by universities when describing their courses and programmes, but also by upper secondary school teachers and guidance counsellors, have resulted in large numbers of Swedish students who were unable to make informed choices prior to entering higher education. By providing all upper secondary school students with accurate information about how much English is used at university and for what purposes would allow them to make diferent decisions regarding, for example, whether to attend optional English classes in school or to engage in extensive reading in English in and out of school.

To conclude, the updated knowledge the present study has provided about Swedish students perceptions of and atitudes towards academic reading in English has the potential to inform educational policy and practises around the world. Sweden is often seen as a model country in terms of second-language proficiency in English, and if students percive academic reading to be an issue in Sweden, it is likely an issue elsewhere as well. L2 reading research is largely dominated by experimental research. Although these studies provide valuable contributions, policy makers and practitioners also need to consider non-experimental factors which may contribute to students reading involvement. Whether or not students are able to read at a certain speed or answer questions acurately about a text in an experiment is irrlevant if the same student perceives that they cannot understand or keep up with their reading at a satisfactory level in their dail lif. The findings of this study suggest a considerable number of students have a negative attitude to assigned reading in English, perceive difficulties comprehending and keeping up with their assigned reading, and were unaware they would be required to read in English as new student. Teaching and learning in a foreign language, particularly in cases such as these

Where students have not actively chosen to study in an L2, is likely to have a negative impact on the quality of learning in the present for some students, and career success and ifelong learning in the future, reinforcing the need for further investigations and policy changes to reduce educational inequalities.
