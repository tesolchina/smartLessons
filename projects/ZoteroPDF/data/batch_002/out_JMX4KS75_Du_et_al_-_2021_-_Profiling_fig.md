Corpus-driven approach

Figure legends, a descriptive statement accompanying a graph, is an essential component of science writing, and novice writers often find it difficult to write an adequate and plausible one. However, almost no discourse analysis has been done of this short yet important part of research articles. Taking a corpus-driven approach, this study explores the use of keywords and lexical bundles in figure legends in order to understand how the discourse is constructed by the salient recurrent single and multiple lexical items. Results show that in figure legends writers are most concerned with the textual descriptions of blue and red as markers of contrasting scientific items and bars and images as representative of graphic shapes. Additionally, writers also frequently use shown and indicated to introduce the demonstrative relationship between graphic elements and scientific information. Further, noun/prepositional bundles account for the overwhelming proportion, followed by verb-related and then clause-related forms, while research-oriented functions of bundles are more frequently used than text and participant-oriented functions. The results offer useful pedagogical input and help novice and L2 writers come to grips with this part-genre.

# 1. Introduction

Effective academic communication is not only based on well-constructed and persuasive arguments but also depends on a sufficient and plausible presentation of data. Almost a half of scientific data are represented visually (Hyland, 2006, p. 53), so visual representations are not mere add-ons or ways to popularise a complex reasoning, but are an essential part f academic discourse (Mog. haddasi et al., 2019; Pauwels, 2006). As Luna (2013) agues, figures in particular serve as the \*spine of scientificstory" and also the backbone of a manuscript" (p. 62). Furthermore, many scientists may read only the abstract, figures and conclusions of a paper, expecting figures to be well laelld and well documented (Armer & Day, 2011 argil & O'Connor, 2013). Therefore, writing figure legends (i.. figure captions), a descriptive statement accompanying figures is an important kill in academic communicatin, since a small change in figure leends "can improve the communication of the main message" (Cargill & O'Connor, 2013, p. 27). However, this short yet important part-genre of research articles has almost escaped scrutiny in the EAP literature.

This paucity of related research is crucial in practice. Kroen (2004) reports that figure legends present enormous difficulty for students, attributing it not only to students' unfamiliarity with this piece of writing but the unavalabilit of legend models and the linguistic resources typically used. Even submissions to Nature journals are also reported to contain "convoluted figure legends" (Nature research, 2019, p. 104). As EAP teachers, in addition, we also find students grapple with this aspect of research science writing, and as academic discourse analysts, we aim to explore figure legends with the methods that \*make sense in environments where we also have to teach, develop pedagogy, produce course materials and the like" (Swales, 2001, p. 45).

Following Grabowski (2015), we believe that acorpus-driven description of the use and functions of key vocabulary complemented by a similar description of lexical bundes i particularly useful for the teaching and research purposes. The information given by these recurrent single-word and mult-word units and their corpus operation can be easily accessed by students Jiang, 2019). By examining keywords and lexical bundles used in figure legends of research articles in physical and life sciences, we hope to extend our knowledge about this particular part-genre and assist students in this aspect of research writing.

# 2. Figure legends and visual presentation of scientific knowledge

The issue of representation, both textual and visual, touches on the lifeblood of scientific activities, and what is communicated as science is the result of series of representational practices (Graves, 2014; Pauwels, 2006). Visual representations, in particular, ae considered as part of academic persuasion, butressing arguments and signalling the importance of research artices (Hyland, 2006). In biology, for example, Miller (1998) shows that visuals in rearch articles both \*rove" and \*clarify" academic aguments by bolstering up knowledge claims and condensing new information for the informed and potentily skeptical reader (p. 43). imilarly, focusing on nanotechnology as an interdisciplinary field, Graves (2014) examined the relationship between visuals and texts, and demonstrates that images and data displays contribute to the argument in experimental work to create knowledge in science. Therefore, visual figures are accorded special prominence in scientific texts, not simply accompanying academic texts but actively constructing meanings (Lemke, 1998; Moghaddasi et al., 2019). This should align with the fragmented accretion of knowledge i sciences which is assembled in relatively small pieces (Becher & Trowler, 2001; Hyland, 2004).

However, figures are difficult to comprehend without an associated text, commonly referred to as figure legend or figure caption Fig. 1 illustrates a typical figure and the figure legend.

Clearly, a figure leend i essentil to ensure the intelligility of the figre wthout refernceto the whole paper, explaining whati shown in the figure and offering readers all pertinent fctsto interpret it (Aliotta, 2019 Skern, 2011). Most of what we know abou figure legends comes from journal guidelines to authors, like the following from Nature Materials:

Figure legends begin with a brief title for the whole figure and continue with a short description of each panel and the symbols used, focusing on describing what is shown in the figure and de-emphasizing methodological detail. The meaning of allerror bars and how they were calculated should be described. Each legend should total no more than 250 words?.

Additionally, some writing handbooks offer stylistic advice on font design and referential content of legends. For example, Cargil and OConnor (2013) suggest that in cience writing figure lends have eneral form with five parts which usully occur in sequence (p. 31):

(1) A title which summarizes what the figure is about;   
(2) Details of results or models shown in the figure or supplementary to the figure;   
(3) Additional explanation of the components of the figure, methods used, or essential details of the figure's contribution to the results story;   
(4) Description of the units or statistical notation included;   
(5) Explanation of any other symbols or notation used.

While the above sequence describes legends as a meaningful narrative, their inguistic features are rarely clarified, and lttle is known about the salient leical items and strings science writers recurrently use to build up the descriptive components. The aspects of linguistic information re crucial,epcially t 2 and student writers given the case studies of how students struggle with his aspect of research writing (Carolina & Carlino, 2017; Tardy, 2009; Zimbardi et al., 2013). Skern (2011) even concludes that almost all scientists, including experienced ones, find it difficult to compose this aspect of manuscript writing (p. 104).

Therefore, taking aorpus-driven approach, this stuy aims to fillthe gap by anempirical corpus analysis frequency distributions of keywords and lexical bundles that are typically used in figure legends in published research articles.

# 3. Keywords and lexical bundles in academic discourse

Computer-aided corpus linguistics has made it possible to statistically identify recurrent singl or multiple word combinations in discourse. Different from a corpus-based approach, which works within a specific theoretical framework of linguistc description, the corpus-driven analysis assumes that "only the existence of words, co-occurrence pattens among words, discovered from the corpus analysis, are the basis for subsequent inguistic descriptions" (Biber, 2009, p. 276). Keywords and lexical bundles, which are typically identified by thi corpus-driven approach as the recurrent vocabulary and prefabricate trings of word forms, are notably illustrative of aspecialized text (Cortes, 2004, 2013; Grabowski, 2015; Hyland & Jiang, 2020), especially when apriori lingustic knowledge about the discourse is not available.

Keywords are those words whose frequencies are unusuall high in a corpus of specialized texts against the frequencies of the same wordforms in a larger and more general reference corpus (Groom, 2010, p. 60). They help to not only reveal the aboutness (SCott & Tribble, 2006) of texts but specify the salient lexcal items which are functionally related to the discourse (Gilmore & Milla, 2018; Grabowski, 2015; Hyland & Jiang, 2020). While suggesting the topics of discourse, keywords are single words. A more informed interpretation of rhetorical resources and functional purposes entails an extension of single lexical items to multi-word combinations.

Lexical bundles, also referred to as clusters and chunks, are one of the most noticeable multi-word combinations of academic discourse (Cortes, 2004; Hyland, 2008; Chen & Baker, 2010) Simply, hey are statisticlly the most frequent \*recurring sequences of words in a collection of texts: extended collcations which appear more repeatedly than expected by chance acros a given range of texts (Biber et al., 1999 p. 990). Lexical bundles are routinely used to ass pragmaticallyefficient communication, and in academic discourse help to reduce readers procesing time because such familiar pattens structure a discourse, guiding readers through it in this figure shown in fig) or linking ideas (wth respect o, are based on) (Biber e al., 2004; Cortes, 2013; Hyland, 2004). In addition, by signaling apropriate use of a disciplinary code, they allow writersto display solidarity with colleagues Hyland & Jiang, 2018) and to construct adisciplinary competent voice (Biber, 2009; Hyland & Jiang, 2019). But while we know much about lexical bundles in main body texts of research articles, almost nothing has been written about their role in the composition of figure legends.

From the above, therefore, this study sets out to explore what figure legends are mainly concened with and how lexical bundles are typically used in their presentation. We first describe our corpus and methods, before discussing the most prominent single and multiple lexical units which characterise figure legends. In the end, implications and limitations are raised about the study.

# 4. Corpus and methodology

# 4.1. Corpus description

Considering that figure legends feature research writing in hard sciences (Pauwels, 2006), we focus on four disciplines, biology and medicine as lif science andhysics and engineerg as ntural sciences. We amed at five journals in each discipline which had achieved the top ranking in their feld according to the 5-year impact factor published by Thomson Reuters's Web of Knowledge ISI in 2019 (Appendix 1). Their representativeness was also confirmed by consulting professors in each discipline. After having scrutinised sampled articles, we finl included ten papers in each of the 20 journals in 2019. Therefore, thecorpus we compiled, comprising 200 research articles, includes 1190 figure legends which total 117,014 words. Table 1 summarizes the corpus information.

# 4.2. Keyword calculation

The keywords were calculated by AntConc (Anthony, 2019), which statisticall compared the word frequencies in our target corpus against a 16 millon-word reference corpus that comprises academic genres of the British National Corpus (BNC). This comparison gives a better characterisation of the differences between two corpora than simple frequency counts as it identifies items which are most prominent and not just common in figure legends.

# 4.3. Bundle identification

Given the length of figure legends, we decided on thre-word bundles because they are more common than four and five-word strings and offr a clearer range of structures and functions than two-word bundles. While "somewhat arbitrary (Biber & Barbieri.

Table 1 Corpus characteristics.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Discipline</td><td>Number of articles</td><td>Number of figure legends</td><td>Total number of figure legend words</td></tr><tr><td> Biology</td><td>50</td><td>274</td><td>41,574</td></tr><tr><td>Medicine</td><td>50</td><td>186</td><td>17,588</td></tr><tr><td>Physics</td><td>50</td><td>287</td><td>27,308</td></tr><tr><td>Engineering</td><td>50</td><td>443</td><td>30,544</td></tr></table></body></html>

2007, p. 267), different frequency and distribution critria have been used in the literature regarding how to identify lexical bundes. The cut-off frequency, which determines the number of bundles to be included in the list, has ranged from 20 (Cortes, 2004; Hyland, 2008) to 40 times per million words (Biber et al., 2004) and even raw frequencies (Chen & Baker, 2010). A second critrion is that combinations have to occur in different texts, usually in at least three to five texts (e.g. Biber & Barbieri, 2007) or $1 0 \%$ of texts (Hyland & Jiang, 2018) to avoid idiosyncrasies of individual writers.

After repeated trials with the corpus data, we set the frequency threshold to five times, which is shown to work agreeably with corpora smalle than one million words (ee Corte, 2012), and incuded those bundes occurring in at least five texts. This resulted in an "optimum" number of bundles, which can sufficiently represent the corpus under investigation. After an automatic search for three-word bundles by AntConc, we manually excluded bundles with text-dependent noun phrases (e. two independent experiments), but retained overlapping word sequences where two three-word bundles are perhaps part of a four-word tring (e.g. are based on and based on the).

The results were then transferred into an Excel file where we coded each example for its grammatical structure and function (see Table 3 and Table 5 respectively). The three authors worked independently, and achieved an inter-rater reliability of $9 9 \%$ on structure and $9 7 \%$ on function before resolving disagreements. Because of the highly compact nature of scientific discourse that values concision, a single bundle may have multiple functions even in a single occurrence. For example, bundles such as are used to can function to refer to an analytical procedure (successve compression and expansion (C/E) cycles are used to achieve refrigeration in a particular subsystem) or guide readers to the organisation of the discourse (coloured asterisks are used to uniquely identif thecells). W examined the context to determine a primary function so that each of 18 potentially multi-functional bundes was coded to one specific function.

# 5. Keywords in figure legends: what are they about?

The basic idea of keyness is that a word form or cluster of words which are statistically more frequent in a corpus than might be xpecte by chance re key to it they are what the texts are about or what i boils down to . nce we have tmed of the verbiage, the adornment, the blah blah blah'" (Scott & Tribble, 2006, p. 56). Keywords can also \*specify the salient features which are functionally related to the genre" (Grabowski, 2015, p. 24). Our comparison of the legend corpus with the BNC academic genres found 385 keywords. Table 2 shows the 20 with the highest keyness value.

Among the 20 keywords, there are four relating to colours (blue, red, gay and green) and six describing graphic shapes (bars, images. dashed, cuves, lines and plots. While other colours and images fl out of the top 20, this result shows that legends were mainly textual presentations of figures, making intelligible what graphic illustration means as in (1) and (2).

(1) each red arrow represents one paraoxon exposure. (Medicine) (2) In all figures, the dashed curves represent the modal excitation distribution at the input .. (Physics)

It is inteesting, however, t se that blue and red had the highest keyness with arelatively high frequency. As seen in (3) and(4), the two contrasting colours were used to foreground the most prominent features that the writers have found in their research, and easily attracted the audiences attention to the prominence. The high keyness and frequency indicate that these striking distinctions are the most essential information writers seek to clarify in figure legends.

(3) For clarity, 2-butene molecules are in red and isobutane molecules in blue. (Chemical engineering) (4) Red indicates enhanced central accumulation relative to non-targeted signaling intermediate ., blue similarly indicates diminished central accumulation. (Biology)

Gray and green were esfrequent options. Gray was typicall used to portray thesetting information against which more prominent eatures were observed (5) and (6). Conversely, green was not used as a background colour but ofte an addition to other commonlyased ones, especially red (7) and blue (8).

(5) Four shades of gray indicated level of IL-2 mRNA relative to non-targeted signaling intermediate .. (Biology) (6) SNPs in gray background are different from the reference genome (isolate P6497). (Biology) (7) The red, green and blue balls represent the Nb, Si and Te atoms, respectively. (Physics)

(8) Red, green and blue lines correspond to uncoordinated PF6, coordinated PF6, FEC ring deformation, and total spectrum, respectively. (Physics)

Therefore, the colour keywords and what they represent in the above examples show us something about how legends portray and complement the visual presentations. Turning to graphic shapes, bar and image had the highest keyness to this short text of figure descriptions and thus were the two most commonly recounted in legends. As shown in (9) and (10), science writers sought to clarify either what bars rfer to in figures or the relationship between elements marked by bars. Diffrently, images were often confined visually by a pre-modification, such as immunofluorescence (11) and $\mathrm { T E M } ^ { 3 }$ (12) where the writers specified the experimental sources Of the reported images.

(9) Bars to the right of the center indicate that relativeto contractile SMCs, modulated MCs have shifted towards a given cell type Bars to the left indicate that they have shifted away. (Medicine)   
(10) Genes of the isolate IP0323 (light bars) classified as either acessory or singleton in the pangenome were analyzed for clustering in the genome (dark bars). (Biology)   
(11) Representative fluorescence images of cells and quantified results are from three independent experiments. (Engineering)   
(12) TEM images of five fields of view from two independent experiments are shown. (Physics)

Despite a lower keyness, dashed, curve, line and plot rpresent the shapes which were also frequentl splle out in legends. Among 109 occurrences of dashed,79 cases colocated with lines in the explanation of what the line differing from regular solid ones eferred to (13). Curves were usually described in terms of the way they were obtained (14) rather than simply what they symbolised, whereas what lines represented were always inroduced in legends (15). Plots were often mentioned when writers sought to specify plot shapes and their composition (16).

(13) Dashed lines indicate the theoretical predictions for the thermalized energy in each of the two species. (Physics) (14) The black curves were obtained using the mean and variance of the data shown in Fig. 2. (Biology) (15) Horizontal lines indicate corresponding $9 5 \%$ confidence intervals around hazard ratios. (Medicine) (16) Box plots depict the IQR, with a white horizontal line representing the median. (Medicine)

In addition, versus and normalized are another two keywords worthy of comment. Versus establishes a comparison between variables or parameters. As shown in (17) and (18) science writers were concerned with such a comparison and attempted to make clear how it was marked in figures. Normalized typically expresses the adjusted values which are intended for a comparison with another et of values. This calculation was often reported in legends to help readers make sense of experimental data (19) and (20.

(17) Cell subsets are scattered by the difference between the Pearson correlation values of their individuallevel slopes calculated either versus individuals' baseline positions in the PCA space or versus age ( $\mathbf { \widetilde { X } }$ axis). (Medicine)   
(18) Microscopy was subdivided into gametocyte versus asexual trophozoite positivity/negativity. (Medicine)   
(19) Data are normalized to the pS19-MLC cell body $( \mathtt { n } = 4 6$ cells from three independent experiments and $\mathrm { P } < 0 . 0 0 0 1$ as determined by a two-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test). (Physics)   
(20) Weight of the liver and spleen are normalized to total bodyweight of wildtype and Mfsd1 KO mice (age: 14 weeks).(Biology)

Furthermore, shown, indicated, showing and indicate were the four verb-related words that were most key to figure legends. It is interesting to note, however, that the present and past participle of show and indicate had a higher keynes than the basic forms. The use of the past participle indicates that compared with other academic textual segments such as research abstracts (Hyland & Tse, 2005), legends are more inclined to take a pasive voice in the reporting of graphic components (21) and (2). Showing was also particularly used as a way of asting science writers to compact much information in such a short piece of text as legends (23) and (24)

(21) Fits are shown along the x direction (a), y direction (b) and z direction (c). (Physics)   
(22) Expression levels are indicated by scales in the lower left of each panel. (Medicine)   
(23) The dashed lines are guides for the eye showing the $\beta$ and $\beta ^ { \prime }$ bands. (Physics)   
(24) The histograms showing the posterior distributions of population mean and standard deviation hyperparameters are given in Fig. 1.(Biology)

Additionally, data and value were also prominently used in figure legends compared with the BNC academic genres. However, to a larger extent data was mentioned to describe the source and component of experimental data by an intertextual link to supplemental materials (25) and (26). Value often referred to probabilit or mean values in legends, and writers sought to explain the calculation of probability values (27) and the figured presentation of mean values (28).

(25) The source data and computer code with instructions of implementation to generate Fig. 1 are fully publicly available at https://doi.org/10.26188/5cde4c26c8201. (Biology)   
(26) Underlying data are available in S1 Data. (Biology)

(27) P values were determined with Student's t-test and corrected for multiple testing by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. (Medicine) (28) Median values of scaled frequencies measured in young individuals are in left bar. (Medicine)

Moreover, respectively also appeared frequently in figure legends, making clear the connection between graphic shapes and what they concerned (29) and (30). Perhaps particular toscientific papers, inset was often used toreer to a small diagram inside a larger one (31 and 32).

(29) The deconvoluted profile for CoCo and the core complexes are described by the dotted line and the dashed line, respectively, for CuFeCoCo, CuCoCoCo and CoFeCoCo. (Engineering)   
(30) Error bars in c and f are derived from Poissonian statistics and range from 0.013 to 0.046 and 0.02 to 0.063, respectively. (Physics)   
(31) The inset shows the same data on an expanded y axis. (Medicine)   
(32) Inset is a schematic of equivalent circuit of the EH for measuring the voltage across a 33 F capacitor. (Physics)

In summary, the keywords above reveal the "aboutness" of figure legends. The most commonly used colours suggest that data visualization strategies inform the legend content and the keywords. We have also seen the graphic shapes science writers are most concerned with in the textual representation of figures. Additionall, verbal and connective keywords indicate the informational and textual characteristics of this short text of graphic description.

# 6. Lexical bundles in figure legends: building blocks of textual presentations

We identified 2047 three-word lexical bundles in the corpus using our criteria, amounting to 10.2 instances per figure legend. This total number comprises 187 different types, with the most frequent being a functio of closely followed by as  function. This analysis shows that despite their limited length, figure legends are composed of these repeated lexical strings, which function as \*important building blocks in discourse (Biber & Barbieri, 2007, p. 270) and also facilitat pragmatically fficient communication of what scientific figures indicate to reader. Addtionaly, it was aso found that lexical bundes in the leends overwhelmingly included parts of prepositional or noun phrases and that they mainly related to referential content rather than to the discourse itelf or the participants. We discuss the structures and functions of the three-word lexical bundles found in figure legends in more detail below.

# 6.1. Structures of lexical bundles in legends

Structural properties of lexical bundles are differentiating feature of academic discourse (Biber et al., 199). In academic writing, bundles are typically prepositional phrases with -of fragments (in terms of) and noun phrase $^ +$ of fragments (the number of) (e.g., Hyland, 2008) or passve-verb fragments (is shown in) (e.g., Chen & Baker, 2010). According to Biber e al. (199), thee three forms comprise over $7 0 \%$ of three-word patterns in academic prose (pp. 994 995) but rarely figure in conversation, where the majority of bundles contain a verb phrase, particularly 'personal pronoun $^ +$ verb phrase' (e.g., I don't know) (pp. 1006-1007).

Based on Biber et al.'s (1999) 12 categories of written academic bundles and Hyland and Jiang's (2018) analysis of a diachronic corpus of disciplinary writing, we identified four distinct categories of formal realisation as shown in Table 3.

The analysis shows that noun-related forms acounted for the largest proportion of bundles followed by preposition-related and then verb-related bundles. Table 4 presents a detailed structural istribution of three-word bundles in thecorpus. I is noteworthy that the proportion of noun-related bundles. $( 4 4 . 4 \% )$ was remarkably higher than that in full research articles $( 2 7 . 0 \% )$ as reported in Hyland and Jiang's (2018) study, whereas preposition-related bundles registered a much lower percentage $( 2 4 . 0 \%$ vs $4 9 . 5 \%$ . The differences may reveal the informational density of this part-genre, since as seen in Table 1 each legend comprised 102.6 words on average. Hence, the information is mainly compacted by nominal strings.

Additionally, these dfferences perhaps relat to the particular communicative purpose of figure legends. A sufficient explanation is always intended in figure legends to ensure that the figures and graphs stand independent of the remainder of a manuscript (Alley, 2018), so science writers endeavoured to either define symbols (33) and measurement units (34) or explain the probabilit of statistically significant values marked in figures (35). As we can see, theseexplanatory acts incresed the proportional use fverb-related bundles in the legends.

(33) Those SNPs are representative of a cluster of SNPs defining a haplotype. (Biology)   
(34) Statistical analysis was performed using a logl-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. (Engineering)   
(35) Genes in candidate PTB taxa identified in 16S rRNA analyses that differ significantly at Padj ${ < } 0 . 0 5$ with a two-sided Wald test are shown in red and those that were not statistically significant are shown in pink. (Medicine)

Furthermore, passive-verb bundles were more often used than copular-verb strings. This provides evidential support to the stylistic advice Armer and Day (2011) offr to students on using passive voices in figure legends. As mentioned above, in legends i is esential to define and describe concisely what science figures ae upposed to show, so writers rely on the recurrent verbal strings to achieve this communicative purpose. The rhetorical function can be also seen in the pasive verbs used in the strings: shown (10), used (5), indicated (3), based (2), compared (2), plotted (2), referre t (2), sociated with (1), cuated (1), found (1), given (1), nomalized (1),

performed (1), presented (1) and treated $( 1 ) ^ { 4 }$

These vera hoe fall into th groups rertie, ining shown, indcated, pltd, rferreto found, give and preened methodological, including used, based, calculated, nodlized, performed and treated, relational, including compared to/with and asso ciated with.

The representative group was the most frequent, introducing the cientific information that is graphicall ilustrated (36) or that readers may find i supplementary materials (37). In addition, the methodological group helped to create n interpretative contex for the results reorted in fires, clarying ether expeimental dtil 38) or sttistical tretments applied (39). Moreoer, the relational group was also indispensable for spelling out the relationship displayed in graphs in order to establish an interpretative context (Anderson, 2014), so we also found compared to (40) and associated with (41) in the corpus.

(36) Expression levels are indicated by scales in the lower left of each panel. (Engineering)   
(37) P values for homogeneity (all ${ \tt > } 0 . 0 5 $ ) are shown in supplementary materials. (Biology)

(41) The black line depicts the proportion of leters associated with th favourite colour (y-axis) for the irs initial ersus all other letters ( $\mathbf { \dot { x } }$ axis) for English-speaking non-synaesthetes. (Biology)

While only two copular be three-word bundles, are available in and are representative of, were identified, they occurred frequently and acrossa wide range of texts. The former was used to direct readers to supplementary materials (42), and the ltter functioned to introduce what images and variants represented (43).

(42) Enlarged graphs of Mulliken charge distribution of atoms are available in the Supporting Information. (Physics) (43) The images are representative of the presence or absence of a large lipid-rich plaque detected by near-infraredspectroscopy at baseline. (Medicine)

Turning to noun and preposition-related bundles, they comprised the major categories, especially noun phrase with of-phrase fragments $( 3 8 . 5 \% )$ and prepositional phrase expressions $( 2 0 . 3 \% )$ . A function of, the number of, the presence of, diagram of the and illustratio of the were the most common five noun-related bundle with of-phrase fragments. This structural patern normall covers a range of meanings in academic discourse and is often used to specify the attributes of what is being discussed (Biber et al., 2004; Hyland, 2008). Infigure legends, however, this form of thee-word bundles was typically used to mark a representative relationship between images and scientific information (44) and a formative relationship between dependent and independent variables (45)

(44) The X-axis represents the number of cell in which specimens of an OTU ocurred, and the Y-axis represents the number of cells in which they were projected to occur after modeling. (Biology)   
(45) FM is due to the effect of the applied magnetic field due to PM1.(Engineering)

In addition, three preositional phrase bundes were identified, including as a function, in the presence and of the two, and they were used frequently and widely. As shown in (46) and (47), writers sought to set up an interactive relationship between experimental variables by this form of bundles. Additionally, the use of the two typically corrsponded to the complex interplay between material information in the investigation of scientific world.

(46) Mean uptake rate by bacterial cells are mathematically simulated as a function of intial cell density within a spherical aggregate of diameter $2 0 ~ { \mu \mathrm { m } }$ $^ { 2 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ after inoculation. (Biology)   
(47) TTP399 was tested in the presence of $\mathbf { 3 ~ m M }$ glucose. (Medicine)   
(48) The combination of the two layers forms the QPGM shown on the right. (Physics)

Rather than being dominated by anticipatory it tructures (itis believed iti neessary) as Hyland and Jiang (2019) found in research articles, clause related bundles in figure legends were principally composed of astract-subject fragments. A sweep of the concordance lines shows that they were used to introduce what graphic shapes illustrated in figures (49) and (50).

(49) Error bars represent standard deviations of the estimated values.(Physics)   
(50) Solid lines indicate the relative energy input necessary to maintain a body temperature of $4 0 \mathrm { C }$ for different air temperatures. (Biology)

As seen above, the building blocks of figure legends primarily comprise noun-related bundles, which points to the informational density of this short pie f text. wver, to incease its intelligilit, wtrs aso frquently employ ver-rla strig,clarifying explanatory relationships between the items presented in the visuals.

# 6.2. Functions of lexical bundles in legends

For a better interpretation of the bundle uses, we grouped bundles into functional categories, and our categorisation of the functions seeks to avoid the proliferation of tyes and sub-types found in the work of Nattinger and DeCarrico (1992), aiming to distil the data into a compact model. Here we followed Hyland and Jiang (2018) in grouping bundles into three main functional groups: research-oriented, dealing with referential functions in the real world; text-oriented, concerned with the organisation of the discourse, and participant-oriented, concerned with authorial stance and reader engagement. However, we expanded the description sub-category to incude tangible and intangibleattributes with referece to the categorisation sugsted by Biber et al. (2004), and the modified functional categories are shown in Table 5.

The data in Table 6 show that research-oriented functions were much more frequently used than the other two categorie, referring to different aspects of experimental details and scientific resuts. Among these referential descriptions, tangible features were most often repreented. We sethis as aconsequence of the mathematization of rearch findings (Graves, 2014), in which a schematic of and the ratio of were used to create the impression that the objects or relations they represented are inherently mathematical.

The high frequency of tangible features may also show a common interplay betwen material and methods section and figure legends (Skern, 2011). To a large extent, this section reports the basics of an experimental design and its methodological approach, while figure legends then specify the exact condtions used in the experiment. Therfore, science writers sought to be specific about the surface of electric clls in a physical experiment (51) r about the amount of electric current traveling per unit at the catalyticsite in an engineering project (52).

(51) Inset shows the result of the Li metal anode surface of the control Li-CS cell (78 cycles). (Physics) (52) In both (C and D) frames, MOF CNx Ar + NH3 represents the contribution to the NC current density of the non-metallic ORR catalytic sites. (Engineering)

In addition, compared with full research articles (Hyland & Jiang, 2018), figure legends registered a higher proportion of text-oriented functions, and the diffrence comes from the use of lexical bundles as structuring and framing signals. As Cargilland O'Connor (2013) note, it i essential for figure legends to "explain what the data being presented are and highlight the key points ofthe part of the resuls sory presented in the visuals (p. 31).Therefore, tex-lated bundes were often applied to bridge the link between the presented data and results in a way that readers can easily recognise (53) and (54).

(53) the total number is shown in the center of the pie charts.(Medicine) (54) Corresponding imaging data are given in the respective columns below: wild type or Itk-deficient 5C. (Biology)

Accounting for the highest proportion among the functional sub-categories, framing signals played a critical role in defining the conditions which either contolled methodological calculation (5) or restricted the interpretation of results (56), so ensured that readers can make sense of the arguments presented in the legends without reference to other parts of academic prose.

(55) The tip-Csample voltage-dependent dissipation taken at constant $\mathrm { d } = 5 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ shows a series of dissipation-enhanced features marked by arrows positioned symmetrically with respect to $\mathrm { V } \mathbf { s } = \mathbf { 0 }$ V ... (Engineering)   
(56) Tc values are clustered according to the underlying mechanism (labelled), which controlsthe magnitude and sign of Tc. (Physics)

Furthermore, it may not be surprising to find that participant-oriented functions were the least often used among the functional categories in figure legends because this account needs to be concise and conveys esential information about the content of a figure and where any data come from (Alley, 2018; Cargil & O'Connor, 2013). Writers, therefore, are more concerned with a succict reporting of what is shown in figures than with establishing an interactional relationship with readers. While we found cases of writers commenting on the possbility of knowledge (57) and directly bringing readers in discourse (58), they were not frequent.

(57) The vertical axis in B represents the logarithm of the cumulative number of values exceeding the current velocity, i.e. the probability of finding a current with greater velocity than that plotted on the horizontal axis. (Biology)   
(58) Note that the component 1 axis for the TB sCCA (left) has been reversed for effective visual comparison with PTB sCCA. (Medicine)

In summary, research-oriented bundles outnumbered both text-oriented and participant-oriented strings as a consequence of mathematical framing of research results, so that apects of methodological details and experimental conditions are always specified in the legends by these referential expressons. Text-related bundles assist in the textual specification and make figure legends easily accessible to readers.

# 7. Conclusion

Figure legends are an essential component of science reearch writing. They are built concisely on referential ontent as journal and stylistic guidelines suggest, and more importantly on a plausible choice of key vocabulary and lexicalstrings. Keywords not only are a summary of the salient lexical items distinguishing figure leends from other types of academic discourse, but als reveal what science writers are most concerned with in both visual designs and textual descriptions. Among the 20 keywords, blue and red are the colours used most prominentl to mark contrasting features shown in figures, while bars and images appear dominant to describe graphic shapes. In addition, shown and indicated are frequent verb choices to introduce the demonstrative relationship between graphic ele. ments and scientific information.

Lexical bundles are recurrent lexical sequences regularly applied to asst academic communication so that readers find such communication eficient and familir. Thestructural distribution of commonly used three-word bundles in leends shows that nominal and prepositional forms account for the overwhelming proportion, followed by verb-related and then clause-related bundle. This may relate to the way that writers seek to clarify either graphic symbols or statistical measurement in legends. In addition, research. oriented functions are more frequently used than text and participant-oriented functions, referring to diffrent aspects of experimental detals and scientific reults. This functional use of lexical strigs can be a consequence f mathematization f rearch findngs, and may pertain to the typical interplay between methods section and figure legends.

The results indicate that the legends in the corpus are largely in line with journal and stylistic guidelines. More importantly, however, we see that writers employ what these single and multi-word sequences aford to formulate the short descriptive texts in a way readers may find accessble and meaningful. In addition, a methodological implication from the study is that a corpus-driven approach is productive if there is littl linguistc knowledge about an unfamiliar academic textual component, and keywords and lexical bundles can be a starting point of corpus analysis by EAP practitioners. Nevertheles, as future lines of research, genre approaches are complementary and can help to unpack the interplay between legends and the figures and how the two semiotic systems collaboratively contribute to the communicative purpose of research articles.

Legends are succinct and work to ensure the intelligbility of science figures, but more complex is the connection between this rhetorical end and the single and multiple lexical units that are repeatedly used. This may account for the difficulties novice and L2 writers have in writing this particular part-genre, so the findings in this study can be translated into teaching material. For one thing, text placement activities can be developed to sensitis students to particular forms and functions of key vocabulary and lexical sequences in figure lends. For another, explicit instruction is also neessary to show students the link between stylistic adice iven by journals and handbooks and the recurrent word combination i illustrative example of figure leends as used in published research articles.
