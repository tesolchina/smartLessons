Graduate supervision

Graduate students often approach research with predefined steps emphasising procedural aspects that occasionally expose their inadequate preparation for research as social practice. The purpose of this paper is to show how an action research (AR) methodology, in conjunction with English for Specific Purposes (ESP) and Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL), has facilitated the scaffolding of explicit formal, rhetorical, procedural, and strategic knowledge in research discourse. We followed a cyclical action research model consisting of 1) recognising students' limited understanding of research as a social practice, 2) developing interventions to promote understanding of how language is structured, represented, and negotiated in scientific discourse, 3) results of the intervention, and 4) reflection. Thematic analysis of six participants' data, including their tasks, reflections, and draft proposals, revealed a discernible progression towards scholarly thinking, transformative learning, and the embodiment of scholarly identity. Integrating ESP and SFL frameworks enhanced our ability to guide students through research-specific discourses, moving beyond a purely theoretical understanding to engage in authentic practices. This approach contributed to the cultivation of Communities of Practice (CoP) in which student-faculty collaboration fostered a shared scholarly mindset and facilitated the gradual integration of students into these academic communities.

# 1. Introduction

Graduate students often think that research is a simple task where they need only follow the proliferating literature that tell them how to conduct resarch (Atkinson, 2005; Crewel, 2014). As aresult, they are likely to engage in the \*procedure [and] principles of research (Atkinson, 2013, p. 60),often resulting in formulaic, predictable, and boring" research (Richardson & Adams St Pierre, 2005, p. 959). For this reason, thesupervision processis critical in guiding novices away from a research checklist where they mechanically review the literature, select research designs, and submit an ethical clearance.

Undoubtedly, supervision should fll a critical role in immersing students in a community of practice where learning is cultivated through active participation and collaborative engagement to not only foster the development of a scholarly identity but also pave the way for meaningful growth (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 1998). However, many universities' supervisory practices merely emphasise supervision as taking responsibility for students' research projects, ffer guidelines for doing research and ethics or refer to the nature of supervisor-student relationships and interactions; thus, the social practices involved in thesis work may remain concealed or not readily apparent (Hajar & Mhamed, 2021; Lee, 2012). In this paper, we explored action research (AR) as an intervention for our students to learn about research to move toward a developmental approach to supervision that \*promotes \*mutual engagement, negotiation, and practice of rpertoire in use" (Dysthe et al, 206, p. 303) and to adopt \*pedagogies of supervision (Fatar, 2014, p. 113) that might lead our students to view their identities as graduate students as flexible, always in the proces ofbeing/becoming scholars (Attia & Edge, 2017).

In higher education, especially in regions where English is a foreign language, English as a medium of instruction (EMI) in pedagogy and practice has increased significantly (Chin & Li, 2021). There is a view that supervisors only need to assist students in finding resources, commenting on writig skill and academic protocols, and inducting graduates into scholarly practices such as conference presentations for students' research training (Ferdinand-James & Medina-Charles, 2022). The itrature on EMI highlights students' language proficiency as one of the most significant challenges to acquiring academic writig or research skills (Chang et al. 2017; Galloway & Rueg, 2020; Zhou et al., 2022). However, we argue that \*language serves as an often unconscious means of evaluating and differentiating students", but students are seldom explicity taught how a particular text type reflets its social purpose context, and associated language features (Schleppegrel, 2004, p.2). With our AR project, we sought to move away from this limited view by using four scaffolded tass that explicitly facilitate the legitimate peripheral participation' that novices need to become members of their academic or disciplinary communities (Lave & Wenger, 1991, p. 109).

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. ESP and SFL

Although Lave and Wenger's Community of Practice (CoP) promotes a shift toward a learning curriculum and sociocultural per. spectives on eaning, it does not provide an explicit pedagogical framework for introducing novices to various scholarly gnres such as synthesis papers, literature reviews, and research proposals. For this reason, we have drawn on the Englis for Specific Purpose (ESP) and Systemic Functional Linguisics (SFL) frameworks, as both are based on a functional approach to language, which ilustrate how scholarly knowledge is structure, formulated, and encoded through language Halliday, 1978; Swales, 2004). In this way, both were helpful i our task design to scaffold students access and engagement with specialised disciplinary or research registers (Authors, 2023; Schleppegrell, 2013; Sidman-Taveau & Karathanos-Aguilar, 2015).

ESP conceptualises genre as \*a class of communicative events (Swales, 1990, p. 58) characterised both by their communicative purposes and by various patterns of structure, style, content, and intended audience" (Dong & Lu, 2020; Hyland, 2018; Swales, 2004). In addition, Tardy (2009) provides a valuable framework for our task design by highlighting four key elements: 1) formal knowledge related to lexical grammar and genre structure, 2) rhetorical knowledge related to purpose, authorial stance, and audience, 3) process knowledge related to procedures and disciplinary discourse, and 4) Subject-matter knowledge focusing on disciplinary content. These four facets of genre knowledge can be flexible, integrated, and overlapping to be contextually relevant. Fig. 1 illstrates an ESP framework that allowed us to emphasise communicative purposes, rhetorical or procedural moves and foreground genre-specific guidance in our tasks and supervisory discussions to induct and socialise our students into the discourse community. Figure 2illustrates an adapted SFL learning that informed the sequencing of the tasks and the specific knowledge-domain they scaffolded.

Although ESP draws on Bakhtin's notions of intertextuality and dialogism, Hyland (2002) argues that it lacks "a systematic model of language" (p. 115). Similarly, Cowley-Haselden and Monbec (2019) claim that some ESP curricula lack an explicit focus on the functional aspects of language. For this reason, we chose to include SFL because it underlies a scaffolded teaching and learning cycle (TLC) with its 1) semiotic mediation (Halliday, 1978), 2) zone of proximal development (Vygotsky, 1978), 3) scaffolding (Bruner,

1990), and 4) visible and invisible pedagogies (Bernstein, 1996). Therefore, we were guided by the SFL teaching and learning cycle (Rothery & Stenglin, 1995) in setting the context and building students' knowledge (Task 1) through deconstruction and modelling (Tasks 2 and 3) and independent construction (Task 4). See our intervention section to learn how we used ESP/SFL in designing and sequencing the tasks.

There is increasing interest in ESP and SFL genre-based pedagogies in higher education to introduce students to scholarly discourse (Hyland, 2011; Liu & Chen, 2020). Few studies make clear how they draw on genre-based approaches in action research or as ped. agogies of graduate supervision. Our work flls this gap by examining the impact of ESP/SFL genre-based tass in an eight-week intervention during our 2022 summer semester. The goal was to increase graduate students awareness of and engagement with the discourse community they enter, how language encodes these disciplinary epistemologies and how language is organised to exemplify research proceses in the humanities (Friedman, 2023). Thus, we illuminate how an AR approach has enabled a systematic and collaborative proces of problem-solving,student learning, and critical reflction on our thesis supervision practices and our attempts to contribute to how ESP/SFL can help improve the scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) in graduate education (Ferdinand-James & Medina-Charles, 2022; Field et al., 2021).

# 2.2. Why action research (AR)?

Action research (AR) is a systematic and cyclical proces of planning, acting, observing, and reflecting to improve teaching practices (Bolon, 2010; Eliot, 2007; Glanz, 1998, 2014). Furthermore, there is a relationship between AR and the Scholarship of Teaching and earning (SoL) in higher education, as it i also linked to reflectie practice, critical pedagogy, and social justice isues (Lorenzett & Walsh, 2014; Miskovic & Hoop, 2006; Thomas, 2011). For this reason, we found it valuable to reflect on how we can better help our graduate students embark on their journey into the unfamiliar teritory of research/thesis (Choi & Richards, 2017; Meyer & Land, 2006. For example, AR has an interventionist underpinning that requires us to problematise our graduate students engagement with their topic choice, proposal design, genre understanding, and literature review and to reflect on the relevance of our supervision practices (Maunder et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2022).

For our study, AR provided a space for self-study and reflecive practice (McNiff & Whitehead, 2002) of our supervisory pedagogy (Fataar, 2014). We argue that our supervision challenges offered us a unique opportunity to criticlly examine and evaluate our practice and plan an intervention relevant to our stuational and contextual dilemma. Through AR, we amed to bridge the gap between our reseach supervision and the explicit communication of scholarly practices to our students to get them to engage more deeply with their own research. In this paper, we adapted Glanz's (1998, 2014) cyclical model to reflect on how we could inroduce genre-based, scaffolded tasks and the outcomes of these tass for our graduate students as they transitioned from coursework in Year 1 to thesis writing in Year 2. The original model involved six steps: Selecting a focus, Collcting the data, Analysing and interpreting the data, Taking action, Reflecting, Continuing, or changing your action. We took four actions in our model because we had already established a focus on analysing previous students' proposals. Fig. 3 shows the four cycles of our AR.

# 3. Research context

Since gaining independence in 1991, Kazakhstan's education system has undergone several rapid reforms, including an ambitious trilingual education policy in which various subjects are taught in Kazakh, Russian, and English in secondary schools and higher educational institutions (Karabay, 2017). Thus, the policy refects the government's neoliberal agenda and its strategic goal of becoming one of the top 30 industrialised countries in the world by 2050 (Nazarbayev, 2012; MES, 2010) and a"competitive player in the regional and global economy (Smagulova, 2008, p.448). Functional proficiency in three languages (Kazakh, Russian, and English) as a desired outcome of trilingual education i considered an imperative of globalisation and an indicator and catalyst of Kazakhstan's competitiveness (Mehisto et al., 2014).

This goal was further entrenched through the adoption of the European higher education system and joining the Bologna Process in

2010. For this reason, the nd for Kazakhstani stdents to master the English lngage has increased because it i seen as beneficial to the country's integration into the global community. As a result of these measures, the number of universities ofering courses or programs with English as a medium of instruction (EMI) has increased from 42 in 2016 (Karabay, 2017) to 70 in 2020 (MES Strategic Plan, 2020, p.19). Universities have begun to implement EMI not only at the undergraduate level but also in graduate programs.

However, research shows that the shift to EMI has led to institutional and student challenges, primarily due to a hasty top-down decision that has burdened takeholders with1) level of preparednes and inadequate English proficiency, 2) lack of qualified faculty capable of teaching and supervising research in English, and 3) lack of materials or resources necessary for trilingual education implementation which has not been considered (Irsaliyev et al., 2017; Karabassova, 2018). English is identified as the biggest chal. lenge for both students and teachers who are unprepared for this transition, especially evident at the graduate level when students struggle with academic reading and writing necessary for the completionof writing their Master's and doctoral theses (Amirova, 2020, Tajik, Manan, Arvatu, & Shegebayev, 2022). This study addreses this gap by conducting action research based on ESP/FL to provide rhetorical and stratic knowlege support studets in writing their theis proects. Therfore, the rech question for hs stdy is: How did a scaffolded ESP/SFL-informed action research project contribute to graduate students' scholarly identities?

The research study was conducted at a graduate school of a research-intensive and well-resourced university in Kazakhstan, which has a diverse team of local and international faculty with extensive research experience at top foreign universtie. The school offers two-year Master's deree rograms in four ares (school education, higher ucation, inclusive education, and multilingual ducation) and a four-year doctorate in education. The programs are competitive and rigorous, with only $2 0 \%$ of applicants admitted. Each ends with a thesis/disseration written in English of up to 20,000 words for Master's students and 80,00 for doctoral students. The par. ticipants in our study are students in the multilingual Master's program They are expected to detemine their research topic by the end of their frst year of study, begin working on their research project, and prepare for ethical clearance at the beginning of their second year. In previous years, they were instructed to work on their research during the summer and submit adraft proposal by the start of the new academic year.

# 4. Research method

This AR study examined the engagement of graduate students enrolled in a multilingual education program from 2021 to 2023. We used data from four intervention ESP/SFL genre-based independent study tasks that our graduates needed to complete during the summer term.

# 4.1. Participants and sampling

This paper used convenience sampling of six Kazakh- and Russan-speaking graduate students (three students of each author's. They were informed about the purpose of our research, that we would use their data solely for research, and that we would protect their identity and ensure anonymity. We emphasised that hir participation was entirely voluntary, and they had the right to refuse or withdraw their tasks if they had any concerns or questions. They consented that their task reflections, summer tasks, and draft proposals could be included as data for research purposes; for this paper, we only included the summer tasks and student reflctions. We safeguarded participants' anonymity and confidentiality by removing any personall identifiable information using pseudonyms to replace participants' names in research-related materials.

Our intervention was exploratory and guided by our interest in developing graduate students as "an ongoing constituent of practice (Bolton, 2010, p. 3). Therefore, AR provided a space for us to engage with and rflect on our supervision as n object of study, as we were interested in our students' perspectives on \*a particular set of activities and [their] experiences" (Cousin, 2005, p. 421) Based on ESP, we combined Tardy's (2009 framework f genre knowledge (formal, rhetorical, procedural, and strategic) with the SFL teaching and learning cycle (Rothery & Stenglin, 1995) to explicitl demonstrate that research is socill influenced and that disciplinary or research discourse is mediated, used, and organised through language (Coffin & Donohue, 2014; Dreyfus et a., 2016). Fig. 4 shows how our tasks construct the field and context of scholarly discourse.

# 4.2. Cycle 1: identify the gap

Before our AR project, students and supervisors worked individually on thesis preparation during the summer semester of each academic yer. However, the supervisors found that students were inadequately prepared to work on their thesis, sometimes leading to a\*clash of expectations, miscommunication and confusion betwen supervisors and supervisees" (Hajar, Mhamed, 2021, p. 187). To address this challenge, the School oficilly introduced the Research Proposal Pass/Fail summer course to the program in 2022 to better prepare students for their second-year thesis. Subsequently, as student supervisors, the researchers adapted the scafflded ESP tasks proposed by Authors (2023) for their graduate summer tasks, presented in this paper through an action research lens.

# 4.3. Cycle 2: the intervention

We adapted the genre-informed tasks (Authors, 2023) and designed four tass that would expand our students' knowledge of how language encodes scintific/reearch discourse in terms of formal, rhetrical, procedural, and strategic knowledge. ach task served as a building block for the next tak and contained the purpose, writing frames, or guiding questions to contextualise, deconstruct, or model the research process. Below, we elaborate on each task, consisting of the same introductory information (research top. ic/problem/research question/purpose/meaning) to bridge to Task 4 (writing a draft proposal), which required these sections. Consequently, we and the students could track the development of their rhetorical, procedural, and trategic kill in the 1) annotated bibliography, 2) literature review, and 3) developing literature themes for their future thesis.

# 4.3.1. Task 1: annotated bibliography

This task was designed to help students systematically engage with relevant research and theoretical studies related to their research topics. Students had to find, select, and compile an annotated bibliography of 20-25 articles and write a short reflection on how the task contributed to their understanding of the research area they wanted to enter. We provided them with a guide to annotated bibliographies that pointed them to the formal, rhetorical, and procedural knowledge associated with annotated bibliographies.

# 4.3.2. Task 2: coding, evaluating, and synthesising literature

Task 2 required students to copy and paste relevant information into a literature map based on Task 1 (see Table 1). In this way, Task 1 served as a bridge to coding and evaluating their research studies, thus improving their coding and data processing skills. In addition, students reflected on the prevailing research methods in their litrature map to provide context for a potential research method that would deepen their understanding of research methods and support informed decisions for their final proposal paper. Fig. 5 llustrates the guided questions and notes designed to help students identify the rhetorical and procedural knowledge scholars draw upon when evaluating and synthesising research findings.

# 4.3.3. Task 3: write up of literature themes

In Task 3, students learned to connect themes and annotations and summarise the literature. They copied and pasted themes (from Task 2) and categorised annotations (from Task1) ccordingly, using transition words for coherence. A100-200 word reflection on the coding and development of themes concluded the task.

# 4.3.4. Task 4: writing a draft proposal

The final task was to write a 3000-word draft research proposal based on tasks 1-3; students could copy and paste from these task to complet various sections of their proposal. lso,students were given guidance on the structure of the proposal, such as introductor

information (research topic/problem/research question/purpose/significance), literature review (Task 3), and their envisaged research methods.

# 4.4. Cycle 3: intervention analysis

We used multiple data sources, such as students' responses to three tasks, a total of 18 reflections, and Task 4, the draft of teir proposal, to understand the outcomes of our intervention, pecifically to ases how the genre-informed tasks, sequencing, guiding questions, writing frames, and reflections contributed to our students' awareness of and engagement with research discourses. The different data ets and coding procedures helped to holistically trace students' experiences, counterct our biases, and ensure that we were not just seeing "what [we] want to see" about students' experiences (Cousin, 2005, p. 242).

First, we used an inductive, thematic aproach following Clarke and Braun's (2013) thematic analysis model to analyse the datasets. We read the data individually and discussed our initial codes/themes. Interestingly, both researchers commented on the emergent value codes, which ilustrated participants research attitudes and beliefs, and process codes, which demonstrated how the tasks led to actions in which they were and became scholars. Second, we arranged each data set into tables, colour-coded our themes, and discussed similarities, differences, and unexpected narratives. In the final step, we organised our common themes in a three-colun table to idenify simlarities, ifferenes, and pattens in how participants thought about and engagd with the tasks and how they contributed to their scholarly work.

# 4.5. Cycle 4: reflection

At this stage, we reflected on our summer tass and the genre knowledge our students acquired. Notably, they understood how Ianguage is encoded in these genres, how their relections, tasks, and draft proposals demonstrate thir scholarly thinking and how they develop a clear stance and voice for their proposed research projects. Our observations and reflections aligned well with themes from our data that indicated their participation in a discourse or community of practice (Lave & Wenger, 2001).

# 5. Findings

We found that the genre-based tasks led to a transition in which students did not simply acquire a collection of skills and content knowledge but evolved into a processin which they became novice researchers. Our datafrom students annotated bibliographies, reflections, and litrature mapping contributed to a third or in-between space where new meanings, ideas, and identities emerge through interactions and negotiations between students and scholarly values and beliefs (Author et al., 2023) for identity navigation, where students begin to experience a sense of competence and expertise. Results suggest that they moved from peripheral participation to thinking, becoming, and being scholars and gradually evolved into full participation (Lave & Wenger, 2001).

# 5.1. Thinking like scholars

The scaffolded tass led to more theoretical, critical thinking, and questioning of students' topics, as well as more imagination and innovative conjecture. In Task 1, the annotated bibliography, students reflected,

I chose several works that will serve as a compass for my future study. Reading papers somehow correlated to my stil not precisely shaped research interest, but they gave me an understanding of the investigation path and themes that might be raised in my future thesis. (Tabila)

I began to understand the depth of the connection betwen emotional intelligence and the language code. My topic is starting to take on a completely different form, and every time, I notice that I'm getting more involved, interested, and excited about my future topic. (Batyrkhan)

Task 1 also encouraged deeper thinking, questioning of theoretical frameworks, and making connections to developments in the ield they wanted to enter. Through the supporting tasks, students tended to move from a passive stance to active participation in their own meaning-making and developing their scholarly voice,

After reading 15 articles about TPACK, I could figure out what I needed from this framework in my thesis. (Vasila)

Latinization is a part of corpus planning, and should I write its connection? I have added it to themes because I have seen language planning in some papers. (Saule)

I also replaced the expression L1\L2 in my study with the \*target language" expression as it i more applicable in this context. (Amina)

I was able to understand the basic concepts that will be used in my research and the level of their study in the context o. multilingual education. (Batyrkhan)

Interestingly, we noted similar scholarly engagement and expression after Task 2, where students analysed, coded, and synthesised their literature from Task 1. They did not rely on instruction when selecting or adding new information to their topics and planned theses. For example, students demonstrated a deeper awareness of their research topic,

After identifying themes in task 2 and later putting the themes into paragraphs using abstracts and my reflections from task 1, I formed my research topic more precisely. (Saule)

I realised that need to add an extra section named Translanguaging Practices; it will help me define the critical terms in my study more clearly and show the usage of translanguaging. (Amina)

Another recurring theme was their thoughts on their future research methods, instruments, and sampling procedures. This is how they voiced it,

In the beginning, I intended to use mixed methods in my thesis and identify the attitudes of parents as well as the relationship between SES, gender, and education of parents with their opinions on Latinization. Now, I doubt that this is necessary because my goal isto identify possble benefits and challenges of the switch to the Latin alphabet that parents might face and contribute to better reform implementation. So, I am considering changing the research questions according to the method and research goal. (Saule)

I, in turn, decided to use either the mixed-method survey, observation, semi-structured interviews, or the qualitative method observation and semi-structured interviews to examine secondary schoolchildren's positions by analysing their home, mainstream school, and peer language practices at home and school. I am thinking about a case -study. (Amina)

It seems that I am going in the wrong way. However, I do not know the correct one, which makes me very confused and upset. I understand the importance of the themes I have highlighted. Still I am unsure whether they are applicable; I am still thinking about it, though. (Aliya)

The results suggest that these students began to think like scholars and displayed dispositions conducive to becoming scholarly Attia & Edge, 2017). Consequently, the summer tass facilitated students' socialisation into research epistemology or cultural snowledge valuable for graduate study or the proposed thesis.

# 5.2. Becoming scholarly

The scafolded tass led students to understand research as an ongoing conversation better. They began to see existing scholarly work in their field and became more aware of past and current discussions about their topic in various contexts and how they could make meaningful contributions to their local contexts. For example, a recurring theme was how the tass developed their scholarly/ content knowledge and skills related to the field they were entering,

The task provided me with more knowledge about content in pre-service EFL teacher education in foreign countries. (Tabila)

Another insight I gained from reading the scholarly papers was that I noticed the general difference in the involvement of other countries in pre-service teacher education quality, while Kazakhstani scientists are not interested, and the government s till not practising reforms. (Tabila)

Task 2 helped students identify similarities and differences between contexts and compare data in other contexts. It also helped them understand the value of the tasks to their scholarly development.

I found coding a very helpful tool for organising the literature and ideas. Coding and mind mapping helped me a lot. I could organise everything to be ready to write a literature review. (Saule)

Comparing East Asian countries with Kazakhstan, there is an apparent similarity in teacher training and the same problematic patterns in higher education. I realised there is a need to conduct a qualitative study to look deeply into the ssues of EFL teachers and their study experience in higher education institutions. (Tabila)

I have learned a lot of information while making a mind map. I saw a clear similarity in their results [results from annotated bibliography] while arranging them in my [literature] table. (Amina)

We found that the tasks led students to engage in academic discourse and recognise that they were entering an ongoing scholarly exchange rather than a closed conversation. For example,

First of al Task 1 helped me to understand how vital my future study is. Knowing what research has aready been done s crucial because I will have the same question but for parents. (Saule)

We can learn from their [other countries] experiences to better understand what challenges we might encounter. I think there is a high probability of such a trend in our country. (Tabila)

Participation in the genre-based summer tass helped participants raise their voices and gain new confidence in their views, which is crucial in establishing a scholarly persona and their abilit to be and assert themselves as scholars. As a result, their reflections showed they were \*in the processof becoming different (Kamler & Thomson, 2014, p. 15) and probably crossing a threshold from the acquisition of knowledge and skill to the internalisation of the values, practice, and ways of thinking inherent to the scholarly community (Meyer & Land, 2006).

# 5.3. Being scholars

Students have shown how to move from peripheral participation' to becoming full members of the scholarly community. For example, they became proficient at identifying connections between concepts and making meaningful statements supported by evidence. For example,

I also found a strong justification for doing the study. This justification is related to the main conception of translanguaging and focusing on schoolchildren as the sample in my study. As a result, [through the tasks], I have found several justifications for conducting research with my sample at my chosen site. (Aliya)

A summary of the main findings and the principal issues and suggestions that have arisen in this literature theme's coding task made me think of anew definition of multilingualism, which will be based on emotional intelligence and language code, making me think, can we really consider ourselves multilingual? (Batyrknan)

The reviewed literature contributes significantly to the future study of teaching and learning styles and adds to my (theoretical) understanding of the concepts and the relationship between the factors highlighted in the reviewed literature. (Amina)

I found a lot of new connections between both concepts that are reflected in my literature review. Although I used concepts of SLA in both sections, I sillfeel that I need a separate section involving key concepts of SLA and bilingualism. (Batyrkhan)

The students' reflections and tasks showed that they could explore different sources of information to enhance their understanding f their rearch topics. For example, they explored different perspectives in the literature, demonstrating that their progression in the scholarly journey includes literature review skills the importance of theoretical grounding, the abilit to identify research gaps and a commitment to advancing knowledge within their specific research context. As a result, we found traces of their evolving identity as emerging scholars.

The annotated bibliography covered my study's main parts and ideas and helped me identify the research gap. (Saule)

Completing the task helped to identify several patterns emerging from works that had been collected for the bibliography. It gave me a distinct vision of the patterns and gaps in studies and helped me formulate my themes for the literature review. (Tabila)

The more literature I read on the topic, the more specific gaps I identify in the Kazakhstani context. (Amina)

Through the tasks, students demonstrated a scholarly persona because they could recognise the importance of a theoretical framework to guide research and avoid ambiguit. They also identified research gaps as opportunitie for valuable contributions and their motivation to explore and advance knowledge in their respective fields.

I realised a huge difference between papers with frameworks and without them, as the framed ones don't let the text be vague. (Vazila)

I have noticed that most studies neglect a theoretical framework or concepts; even theoretical articles fail to mention them. When it comes to my framework, I think that I will focus on a conceptual framework. (Saule)

I perceive it [theoretical framework] as an important element of my study. Continuing reading about the Kazakhstani context, I related everything to the TPACK framework and realised how it facilitated my focus on research problems, questions, and methodology. (Vazila)

This [lack of previous research on the topic] suggests that my research can make a significant contribution to the role of emotional intelligence in learning foreign languages in such a multilingual environment as our country. (Batyrkhan)

Although this kind of research is emerging in several fields, I find limited articles where technology in the language classroom expressed through visual art. This gives me confidence in filling a gap and inspiration to continue this way. (Vazila)

'specially in Task 4, students demonstrated using existing knowledge to develop new perspectives. For example,

In the context of my research, these characteristics all have a certain degree of importance, but the category of emotions ir relation to language learning proficiency and academic performance remains underexplored. (Batyrkhan)

However, there seems to be a scarcity of research investigating teachers actual clsroom experiences with reference to their application of learning styles and the impact of learning styles on the formation of students' communicative competence. (Aliya)

Consequently, the summer tasks introduced students to scholarly methods of understanding, thinking, and rationalising within a scholarly community. Even though they focused on aspecific set of scholarly skils, the ESP/sFL frame contributed to students active participation and a shared understanding and communication between students and supervisors about the expected values, practices, goals, and experiences within students feld of study (Lave & Wenger, 1991, 2001). In this way, students experienced their scholarly becoming as "a way of being, rather than new ways of doing" (Ai & Edge, p.33). For example, they shifted from predefined competencies encapsulated in the research litrature, and their thinking demonstrated a scholarly conversation emerging about their research topics. We found them creating, innovating, and surpassing our conventional expectations of formulaic research steps. Interestingly, it also resulted in selfreflection about how our students' sensemaking of their research and scholarly becoming contributed to us realising that we are beinning to shift from \*functional' and "enculturation" supervision to consider how we could embrace "an emancipatory or relationship-development mode of supervision' (Pather, 2022, p. 54).

# 6. Discussion and conclusion

Our paper aimed to show how an action research approach combining ESP/SFL-informed research tasks allowed usto reflect on, identify, and explicitly scaffold the role of language in organising, representing, and negotiating scientific knowledge production in higher education (Choi & Richards, 2017). We found that an ESP/SFL-informed AR approach was helpful in \*tracing development, noting how changes occur and using it in a diagnostic sense to establish problems" (Chrisie, 2012, p. 190), and it provided us wit a refined and diagnostic tolkit that enriched our understanding of how to mediate research-specific discourses and registers when mentoring MA graduate students into their thesis work (Schleppegrell, 2013). More specificall, our paper highlighted the following benefits of ESP/SFL for a pedagogy of supervision and enculturating students into thinking, becoming, and being novice researchers (Fataar, 2014).

First, the ESP/SFL action research helped students cross thresholds that are "conceptual gateways or portals that lead to a pre viously inaccessible and initiall perhaps troublesome way of thinking about something" (Meyer & Land, 2005, p. 373). For example, our students responses to the tass indicatd that they crossed a theshold into \*communicative practices or literacies" aociated with producing scientific knowledge (Wingate & Hakim, 2022 p.6). Although we did not use ESP to teach genre analysis explicitly, our findings indicate that the scaffolded tasks, writing frames, and guiding notes allowed our students to participate in a discourse community in which they employed a range of strategies that allowed them to engage more deeply with their own research topics. We also found that the tasks "resulted in increased confidence in the participants capacity to excel a scholars (McCoy & Winkle-Wagner, 2015, p. 423). In addtion, their relections and dialogues indicatdthe mergence f cholarly identity and a chang in their habitus or scholarly dispositions (Bourdieu, 1977). The results aso suggest that our ESP/FL-based AR tasks provided epistemic access because they helped students understand how language conveys specialised, disciplinary content, which is particularly important for academic writing and research (Morrow, 2003). In this way, they went beyond the superficial aspects of genres but could delve deeper into the core assumptions and goals of their discourse community to asses the appropriateness and effectiveness of rhetorical, procedural, formal, and subject knowledge alongside their peers (Bazerman, 2009). Thus, our participants acquired the cultural capital necessay to understand their field's conversations (topics), how it is organised and structured, and how to find their own voice/stance (Bourdieu, 1977; Ferdinand-James & Medina-Charles, 2022).

Second, our findings suggest that our genre-based AR tasks opened up an in-between or third space for students own learning that helped them see themselves as capable of producing knowledge and that being/becoming" aresearcher is both "socially mediated" and a form of \*internal growth" (Attia & Edge, 2017, p. 34; Bhabha, 2004). This space allowed us to move away from skills-based research where students view themselves as "reproducers of knowledge" engaged in a \*knowledge-tlling discourse" because our participants were and became \*knowledge producers" engaged in a \*knowledge-generating discourse" (Bartholomae, 1985, p. 139) Such a third space was also crucial to our development as supervisors, as it demonstrated the relevance of ESP/SFL to graduate supervision as it led to collaboration and co-construction of knowledge etween supervisor and superiee in a learning community (Lae & Wenger, 1991). In this way, it encouraged critical elf-eflection on our supervision approaches and how we might usegenre-based approach to explicitly shape our students' understandings of scholarly knowledge, academic discourse, and communication within a scholarly community and culture (Abdullah et al., 2022; Banegas & Lowe, 2021).

Third, our ESP/SFL approach led to Communities of Practice (CoP) as we developed shared scholarly thinking with students that contributed to their gradual integration as new members (Lave & Wenger, 2001). Because ESP/SFL-informed tass went beyond mere knowledge of research concets and facts, they facilitated students' immersion in authentic practices from the periphery toward the centre (Banegas & Lowe, 2021; McCoy & Winkle-Wagner, 2015). Thus, our summer task exemplify legitimate peripheral participation (LPP) of students within sociocultural communities where novices are guided by more experienced members (Lave & Wenger, 1991) ESP/SFL also opened a space for engaging in research as asocial practice in which collective action, collaboration, and shared learning and development shaped how we learned and renegotiated our identities as scholars and supervisors (Wenger, 1998, p. 45). Our ESP/SFL tasks facilitated an explicit pedagogy in which we directed novices attention from a research checklist to participation in a scholarly CoP (Lave & Wenger, 1991; Wenger, 2010). Therefore, we argue that the ESP/SFL tasks allowed us to take a more proactive approach to help our students develop research and scholarly identities (Feldman et al., 2013).

In summary, we have experienced our ESP/SFL action research as an approach to systematically identify our pedagogical and student learning challenges, based on which we plan contextualised interventions to "deliberately change, modify, and improve our professional practice" (Burns, 2005, p. 60). Furthermore, we argue that our ESP/FL tasks offered a bridge for our students to gain access to ways of communicating that have accrued cultural capital in particular profesional, academic, and occupational communities' (Hyland, 2002). As a result, they led to a \*threshold crossng" for us and our students because we experienced a "tansformed way of understanding, or interpreting, or viewing something" as ur perceptions of our students scholarly abilities and our supervision practices were irrevocably altered (Meyer & Land, 2006, p. 3).

# 6.1. Recommendations

Our ESP/SFL action research llustrates the need for a reimagination or shift from traditional supervision towards a supervision pedagogy to scaffold stdents into communties of reearch practice (Fatar, 2013; Green, 205).Through our asks, we ilstrated that traditional supervisory practice and self-help books about writig a disertation can reduce research to mechanical procedures that will probably fail to make explicit the pedagogical aspects of nowledge transfer, scholarly lerning, and cholarship as a conversation in the thesis-writing process. Our ESP/SFL-informed tasks functioned as a pedagogy of supervision, allowing graduates to develop a scholarly identity as a continuous processof being and becoming cholarly that was visible in their stance-taking and expressing themselves with increasing autonomy. As a result, we recommend that future research:

1. Explore how ESP/SFL can inform Mentorship Frameworks for Supervision by:

- Including ESP/FL components in training programs for thesis supervisors to guide students in content and navigating how language is encoded in research genres to support the mentoring or co-construction of graduate students' scholarly identties. - Embedding ESP/SFL concepts into supervisors' reflective practices to highlight how these principles could elevate communication and support in the supervisory relationship.

<plore case study research on how ESP/SFL can contribute to university supervision pedagog.

- Investigating how ESP/SFL principles can make explicit the community of practices encoded through language that often hinders students from navigating or experiencing the scholarly journey as a threshold crossing into becoming and being scholars. - Introducing ESP/SFL-informed peer review sessions to encourage supervisors and students to analyse and provide feedback about how language encodes the procedural, rhetorical, and strategic knowledge relevant to the academic discipline of the thesis.
