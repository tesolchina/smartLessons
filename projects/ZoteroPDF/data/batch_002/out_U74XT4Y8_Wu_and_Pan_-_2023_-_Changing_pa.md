While the grammatical marking of stance in academic writing is dynamic and susceptible to change over time, relatively few studies have tracked the changing patterns of stance expressions in contemporary medical academic writing. Based on 480 medical research articles published in top medical journals between 1970 and 2020, this study investigated the use of three major types of stance devices (modals, stance adverbials, and that-complement clauses) from a diachronic perspective. Results showed that the three types of stance devices and their functional/syntactic categories displayed a clear downward trend. In terms of stance markers within functional/ syntactic categories, results demonstrated that stance markers indicating certainty declined in use, whereas stance markers conveying uncertainty increased. The results indicate that medical academic writing tends to become less interpersonal and more informational over time. In addition, medical writers are inclined to make more cautious and tentative knowledge claims across the years. These changes may be related to the development of medical science and have important pedagogical implications.

# 1. Introduction

The past decades have witnessed a growing interest in investigating academic discourse diachronically. Research has focused on how various linguistic features in general have changed across time (e.g., Biber & Gray, 2016; Hyland & Jiang, 2019). Among them, the diachronic use of stance devices has received considerableatention (e.g., Biber, 2004; Gillerts & Van de Velde, 2010; Hyland & Jiang, 2016; 2018a; P0ole, Gnann & Hahn-Powell, 2019; Deng e al., 2021). Some studies have quantified the diachronic use of stance devices across dsciplines and documented a downward trend over the examined years, though there has een disciplinary variations. For example, Hyland and Jiang (2016) found a decrease of explicit stance expressions in the soft sciences, but an increase in the hard sciences. As the use of tance devices constitutes a central dimension of interpersonalit Hyland, 2005a), the decreasing use of stance features suggests that the degree of interpersonality of the discourse has reduced (Gillrts & Van de Velde, 2010). Some other studies have analyzed how the lexical realizations of stance (i.e., stance markers) changed over time. They showed that stance markers conveying diffrent degrees of certainty and doubt evolved in different directions, which reflects writers' levels of commitments to their claims over time (e.g., Hyland & Jiang, 2018b; Poole et al., 2019).

These diachronic studies have provided valuable insights into how grammatical stance device evolved over time and allowed us to better understand the rhetoric of contemporary academic discourse. However, they generally focused on non-medical disciplins e.,

Gillaerts & Van de Velde, 2010; Hyland & Jiang, 2016; 2018b; Deng et al., 2021), with relatively litte atention paid to contemporary medical science. As a highly influentia field, medical science occupies a prominent socio-historical position in most societies and times (Goti, 2016; Millar et a., 2019) and merits gatr ttention than it has reived. irst, mea sci tand a the intectionof the natural, social, and human sciences and it isilinary boundaries traverse the traditional cateorizations of hard and soft disciplines, making it acrossdisciplinary field (Fryer, 2022) It is unclear whether medical science follows the hard or the soft ciences in the diachronic us f tance fatures. Second, preious studies on tance features in medcal discourse are mosty synchronic investigations meant to describe the functions of stance expressions (e.g., Salager-Meyer, 1994) or contras the patterns of stance use in different types of texts (e.g., Gray et al., 2011). As medical cience and medical discourse are constantly changing, so are the linguistic and rhetorical means by which they are primarily communicated (Atkinson, 1992; Li & Ge, 2009). A diachronic analysis can reveal important features about the discursive and rhetorical strategies of medical science and of the medical community at large (Sala ger-Meyer, 199). Finall, the relatively few diachronic studies of stance devices in medical discourse mainly focused on earlier pe. riods (e.g., Hiltunen, 2022) and/or texts were sampled at long time intervals (e.g., Biber, 2004 at 50/100-year intervals).

Based on a 10-year interval between each, this study aims to track the diachronic use of grammatical stance devices in medical research articles (RAs), a key genre of medical discourse, as well as a major site for the construction and negotiation of medical knowledge. The ret of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 first briely inroduces stance and interpersonality as well as major types of lexico-grammatical stance devices, then it reviews previous studies on English medical discourse and the diachronic use of stance devices in academic writing. Section 3 introduces corpus compilation, three major types of tance devices, and data retrieval procedures adopted in this study. Section 4 presents the results, followed by Section 5 that discusses the main findings and the pedagogical implications.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Stance and interpersonality in academic writing

Stance ca be defined as the markng f wters peronal feelings, aitude, r asssment iber e l., 199. t is cloely relaed to the concept of interpersonality that involves the use of language to encode interactions, enabling writers to engage with readers, to express and understand evaluations and feeligs (Halliday, 1994). According to Hyland and Tse (2004) all stance features are interpersonal because they express the writers stance by evaluating the propositions and take the readers responses into consider. ations. For instance, how writrs are committed to the veracity of the information, what perspectives they take, and how they project themselves into the discourse and interact with readers (Biber, 2006; Gray & Biber, 2012; Hyland, 2005a). Thus, stance features construe important aspects of interpersonality (Hyland, 2005b). Although they do not cover the ful range of what can be subsumed under interpersonality, investigating these features offrs a way of exploring the degre of interpersonalit of discourse (Gillaerts Van de Velde, 2010). The more stance features are used in a text, the more interpersonality the text can achieve (Abdi, 2002). By contrast, removing or reducing the use f stance dvice may suggest that the text becomes les interpersonal (Gillrts & Vande Vede 2010).

As important ways of marking stance, lexico-grammatical devices can be words, phrases, and clauses (Gray & Biber, 2012) and they can be categorized into several major types. Biber et al. (199) identified five major lexico-grammatical tance structures (modals, stance adverbials, complement clauses, stance noun $^ +$ prepositional phrases, and adverb premodifiers) that formed a continuum, ranging from explicit to implicit stance marking. Each stance structure consists of a number of stance markers expressing different stance meanings. Up to now, many studies have adopted Biber et al.'s (199) stance framework and focused on three or four major types of grammatical stance devices (e.g., Biber, 2004, 2006). For example, Biber (2006) contrasted the use of four major types of stance devices (g., modals, stance adverbials) in universty registers (e.g., classroom teaching, textbooks). He found that all stance features were relativel rare in textbooks, indicating that textbooks tended to state claims without overt marking of stance. Gray et al. (2011) synchronically examined the use of three major types of stance devices (modals, stance adverbials, and that-complement clauses) in early medical texts (1665-1712). By comparing non-RAs (e.g., reports, leters) and other traditional medical texs (e., treatises, recipes), they found that the three types f stance devices varied systematiclly acros ifferent types of medical texts. In summary all the aforementioned studies focused on thre to four major types of stance devices. In this study, we followed Gray et al. (2011) who examined three typical types of stance devices (modals, stance adverbials, and that-complement clauses) in medical prose.

# 2.2. Studies on English medical discourse

A large number of studies have focused on medical discourse as it can inform about how the language of science has developed in constructing and communicating knowledge in English (Tavitsainen & Pahta, 2011). Some studies have diachronically analyzed medical discourse and documented important changes (e.g., Atkinson, 1992; Li & Ge, 2009). For instance, Atkinson (1992) examined the rhetorical and lingustic changes in medical texs sampled from 1735 to 1985 and found that medical discourse graduall became less afective and more informational over time. In recent decades, research on historical medical writing has atracted increasing attention, most notable by Taavitsainen and colleagues. They have conducted a series of corpus-pragmatic analysis of English medical texts from 1375 to 1800 (e.g, Tavitsanen & Hiltunen, 2019; Taavitsainen & Pahta, 2011) and observed major shifts in the argumentative structures and inguistic fature. For example, from 1500 and 1700, writers attitude towards the object of enquiry changed from the absolute certainty of the cholastic thought-style to cautious ssumptions of the researcher based on laboratory experiment, which parallels the epistemological shift from scholastic argumentation to empirical observation (Pahta & Taavitsainen, 2011)

Focusing on that-clauses, Hiltunen (2022) showed the increasing importance of experimental philosophy and empiricism in the eighteen-century English medical texts. Some other studies have examined medical discourse from a synchronic perspective and uncovered certain linguistic features of medical discourse (e.g., Kim & Crosthwaite, 2019; Yang, Zheng & Ge, 2015). For example, Yang et al. (2015) explored the distribution and functions of the value and the orientation of epistemic modality in medical RAs. They found that medical writers tended to make claims in a tentative, reserved, and objective way. Flotum et al. (2006) found that medical writers tended to present results objectively rather than set up a dialogue with readers when compared with other disciplines.

To sum up, previous studies have showed that medical discourse has undergone inguistic and style changes in response to societal and cultural changes and that medical discourse displayed discipline-specific features in knowledge construction. Although these studies contribute to our understanding of medical discourse, most studies are synchronic and those diachronic studies mainly focus on medical discourse of much erlier centuries (., 1700-1800) t is unclear how the use of linguistic fatures (., stance devices in medical discourse has evolved in the recent five decades. An investigation into this period would shed new light on the diachronic development of medical discourse.

# 2.3. Diachronic studies on stance devices in academic writing

Diachronic research is usuall based on 'snapshot corpora (McEnery & Hardie, 2012), representing a picture of the typical texts in the target discourse community at distinct points over a given time span, ranging from a few years to centuries Hyland & Jiang, 2019) The value of diachronic studies has long been recognized (e.g., Atkinson, 1992; Bazerman, 198. A diachronic approach to stance devices can track the developmental trace of writers evaluating practices, enrich, and to some extent, reshape our understanding of the matter (Xie, 2020). Recently, an increasing number f studies have analyzed the diachronic use of stance devices in academic writing, involving changes in frequency as well as in the use of stance markers.

One strand of research has explored the dachronic changes of stance devices acrossacademic disciplines. Despite an overall decline of stance use studies oserved opposing changing patterns acros the soft and the hard disciplines (eg, Hyland & Jiang, 2016; 2018a; Deng et al. 2021). For example, drawing on a corpus of RAs sampled at 20- to 30-year intervals over 50 years (1965, 1985, and 2015) from four disciplines (e.g., applied linguistics, biology), Hyland and Jiang (2016; 2018a) investigated the diachronic use of interactional metadisourse ., hedges, boosters). The found that the soft sciences showed a decline in frequency, whereas the hard sciences displayed an increase. Based on the same corpus, Hyland and Jiang (2018b) examined evaluative that-clauses and found that biologists tended to employ more uncertainty words to control that-clauses (e.g, sugest) over time, while electrical engineers and linguists preferred to use more certainty controlling words (e.g., demonstrate).

Another strand of research has tracked the diachronic use of stance devices in a particular academic discipline. For example, based on ARCHER corpus that was sampled at a 50-year/100-year interval during 1665 and 1990, Biber (2004) made a cross-register his torical comparison among medical prose, drama, personal ltters, and newspapers, by investigating four major types of stance devices (modals, stance adverbials, that-complement clauses, and to-complement clauses). He found that the changes of stance devices in medical prose underwent three diferent stages throughout time. After experiencing a relatively stable stage, most stance features increased in frequency, and then started to decline around 1900. As the study mainly described the broad changing patterns across registers, it did not document in detail how semantic categories changed in frequency in medical prose. Gilaerts and Van de Velde (2010) diachronically examined the us f interactional metadisourse in the reearch artice abstracts from applied linguistics between 1977 and 2007. They found that the overall use of interactional markers dropped over the three decades, sugesting that the abstracts became les interpersonal over time. Recently, Poole et al. (2019) investigated a number of epistemic stance markers (modals, hedges, and boosters) within a topic-focused, diachronic corpus of biochemical RAs (1972-2017). They found that epistemic stance markers conveying uncertainty and doubt declined g., might, probable), whereas stance markers refecting a high level of certanty increased (e.g., can, find).

In brief, results of the above-mentioned studies are generall consistent, showing that athough the overall use of stance devices declined in academic writing, disciplines did not move in uniform ways. However, there is almost no systematic study on the diachronic change of stance-making practices in contemporary medical writing. As a noteworthy exception, Biber (2004) sketched a general picture of the diachronic use of stance features in early medical texts sampled at 50/100-year intervals. Although his study laid the groundwork for overall generalizations about the changing pattens of stance devices, \*more detaled investgations are required to confirm and interpret the general changing patterns" (Biber, 2004, p. 131).

To help fillthe research gaps, we conducted a more focused and finer-grained analysis of major types of grammatical stance device. in medical RAs sampled at six 10-year intervals across 50 years (1970-2020), which allows us to gain a much richer and more nuanced understanding of the diachronic changes in stance use over time. Following Gray et al. (2011), we focused on three major types o! stance devices and aimed to address the following questions.

1) Has the use of the three types of stance devices in the medical RAs changed over the past 50 years?   
2) Has the use of functional/syntactic categories of stance devices in the medical RAs changed over the past 50 years?   
3) Has the use of stance markers within functional/syntactic categories changed over the past 50 years?

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Corpus

To trace the changes in the use of lexico-grammatical stance devices in medical academic writing over the past 50 years, we compiled six sub-corpora consisting of full-length empirical RAs, representing different time periods. Diffrent from most recent diachronic studies that included three sampling points at 20- to 30-year intervals (e.g., 1965, 1985, and 2015), our study covered six sampling points evenly spaced at 10-year intervals (1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020). There are two main reasons behind this choice. First, within a given time period, more sampling points contribute to higher granularity of diachronic analysis, which helps improve the accuracy and usefulnes of the results (Gabrielatos et al., 2012). Second, focusing on shorter time intervals helps to identify periods of relative stability and flux with greater accuracy (Biber et al., 1994) and the 10-year time spans could serve as reasonable time windows for tracking the possible diachronic changes in RAs (Li, 2021). Finall, focusing on five decades sufficient to explore the diachronic change of linguistic features in academic writing (Wen & Lei, 2021). The year 1970 was set as the starting point mainly because the RAs of the four medical journals have become more homogeneous (by following the standardised IMRD format) since 1970 (Sollaci & Pereira, 2004), which ensures the comparability acros different time periods. Moreover, a similar time point was widely adopted in previous diachronic tudies (e., Hyland & Jiang, 2018a; Deng et al., 2021), which enables comparisons.

Our journal selection was ased on the three criteria proposed by wogu (1997). Representativity refer to the fact that the selected journals are representative of the language used by the medical discourse community. Reputation, mainly reflected by the impact factor, refers to the status of the journals among medical rofessionals and rearchers. Accessbility means that the selected RAs are accessibl. Based on the criteria four prestigious medical journals were selected, Lancet, The New England Jounal of Medicine (NEJM), The British Medical Journal (BMJ), and The Journal of American Medical Assciation (JAMA). They served to be the "prototypical exemplars" (Swales, 1990, p. 107) of the medical discourse community and RAs published in these journals were "fairly representative of the genre in content and style (Li & Ge, 2009, p. 95. Thus, the four journals were widely used in previous studies of medical discourse (e.g., Fryer, 2022; Nwogu, 1997; Yang et al., 2015). lthough one journal is UK-based and the other threeare US-based, the nluence of geographical location on the use and evolution of linguistic features was not considered here given that the four journals are similar in target audience and internationality.

Research articles were selected based on three criteria. First, all the RAs were under categories such as \*research articles" and "original contributions'. Book reviews, letters, and case reports were excluded because stance devices vary systematicall across different types of medical text (Gray et al., 2011). Second, empirical RAs were chosen given the influence of research paradigm (e.g, theoretical, empirical) on the use of stance devices (Gray, 2015). Third, as the four medical journals are weekly publications, one article was selected from each isue and no more than two articles were selected within the same month soas to cover as many isues as possible, as well as toeliminate the possible influence of topics within an isue. In the end, 20empirical RAs were chose from each of the four journals at each of the six sampling points, which made 480 medical RAs, totaling 1.4 million words. Table 1 details the composition of the medical corpus. The six sub-corpora were matched for the number of texts, but not for the number of words. To mitigate this issue,frequencies were normalized (per 1o00 words) to allow direct comparisons of the sub-corpora.

# 3.2. The analytical framework

By following Gray et al.'s (2011), which was based on Biber et al's (199) stance framework, we examined the three major types of stance devices (modals, stance adverbials, and that-complement clauses) that expres overt atitude or asessment towards propositions. Linguisically, the thee types of stance devices consist of two essential components: a constituent ontaining a lexical item that expresses a stance meaning; and a constitent with a proposition that is framed by the lexical item (Gray & Biber, 2015). Example (1) consists of a lexical item may that expresses a stance and a proposition serve as a baseline for comparisons by hospitas. The modal may expresses the writers' uncertainty towards the proposition. Table 2 summarizes the thre types of stance devices and their functional/syntactic categories.

(1) The data presented here may serve as a baseline for comparisons by hospitals.

Modals are frequently used to convey stance meanings, but they are less explicit because modals are incorporated into the main clauses (expressing the framed propositions), as shown in example (1) above.

Stance adverbials provide explicit asssments of the propositions contained in the matrix clauses. Their grammatical realizations mainly inde single adverb ., rly) ositioal phra , aordng to), and subornat lause (e. I thk). llthese forms express different stance meanings, e.g., expressing certainty and doubt (2), marking the source of the information (3).

(3) According to the National Family Health survey (NFHs-3), in India only $4 4 \%$ of children aged 1-2 years have received the basic package.6

That-complement clauses are arguably the most explicit and the most important grammatical stance device in English because they are specialized in this function (Biber, 2015). The main clause contains a stance marker (i.e, the controlling word) that expresses a stance with respect to the proposition embedded in the that-clause (Wu & Pan, 2023). The most common type of that-clauses is verb-controlled. For example:

(4) They suggest that compression bandaging should stop below the knee.

According to Biber (2015), although other grammatical stance devices also express stance, they are not specialized for stance functions in the same way that that-complement clauses are (e.g., to and WH-complement clauses), or they i mplicitly mark stance and do not express a stance toward an entire proposition (e.g., stance noun $^ +$ prepositional phrases, adverb premodifiers).

Within each of the three types of stance devices inguistic items can be classfied according to the semantic association (i.e, the general meaning being expressed by the stance features). Modals are distinguished into three major semantic categories: possbility/ permission/ability, prediction/volition, and necessty/obligation. Similarly, stance adverbials are distinguished into four semantic categories: certainty, likelihood, communication, and attitude. That-complement lauses are divided into three major syntactic types according to the grammatical category of the controlling word (i.e., a verb, noun, or adjective).

According to Biber et al. (1999), the division of words (in this case modals and stance adverbials) is based on ther core meanings (i. e., the meaning that a speaker/writer tends to think of first). Although many words have multiple meanings belonging to more than one semantic domains, most words commonly have core meanings belonging to only one semantic domain. Thus, in general, the semantic classfication of words is not problematic. One advantage of such divisions is that it is ossible to track the diachronic changes of specific forms and semantic categorie relative to other changes within the system of stance devices (Biber, 2004). In th iterature it is also common to frame these categorie as functions to expresscertain meanings in discourse. For the purpose of our study, we labeled them as functional categories hereafter.

# 3.3. Research procedures

To retrieve modals, stance adverbials, and that-complement clauses, a series of procedures were followed. First, the Biber Tager, with an average accuracy of more than $9 0 \%$ (e.g., Biber et al., 1999; Gray, 2015), was employed to automatically tag all linguistic features, including the three major types of stance devices. Second, another program, Tagcount, was used to count the frequencies of stance devices.All counts were normalized to per 100 words and rounded up to two decimal places. Third, the kwIc (key word in context) concordance lines of stance devices were generated for further analysis. The stance markers examined in this study were provided in Appendix A. Spelling variations and all word forms f a lemma were taken into consideration. The concordance lines were hand-checked for accuracy and irrelevant instances were removed, for example, that acting as a demonstrative or arelative ronoune. 8., There were 211 admissions that fit the study criteria.).

To track the evolution of stance devices over time, two statistical measures were employed. First, the percentage change was calculated based on the equation: $\%$ ${ \mathrm { h a n g e } } = ( { \mathrm { F } } 2 - { \mathrm { F } } 1 ) / { \mathrm { F } } 1 \times 1 0 0 $ Percentage change in mathematics is used to uncover the differences between the old and the new values. Therefore, F1 represents an old value (frequency in 1970) and F2 represents the current value (frequency in 2020). Second, following previous studies (e.g., Hilpert & Gries, 2009; Poole et al., 2019), Kendall's $\boldsymbol { \tau }$ correlation coefficient was calculated to evaluate the strength of diachronic trends. That is, a correlation cofficient determines whether the occurrence f alinguistic feature isassociated with historical period, measuring both the extent and the direction of change (Biber & Gray, 2016). The correlation coefficients have a scale of $+ 1$ to $^ { - 1 }$ . A value approaching $+ 1$ or $^ { - 1 }$ represents \*the passage of time correlates perfectly with an increase or a decrease in frequency" (Hilpert & Gries, 2009, p. 390), while a value near 0 indicates that there has not been any consistent pattern of change through time.

To summarize, statistical measures and KwIC lines are complementary to each other. While statistical measures can uncover general changing patterns, KwIc lines can explore specific changes in the use of stance markers and their implications.

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Changes in the three types of stance devices

By following the above procedures, we obtained the normalized frequencies of the three types of grammatical stance devices in the medical RAs. We found a downward trend in the total use of stance devices over the past 50 years, as well as in each of the thre yes. The overall use of stance devices dropped significantly, falling from 12.67 per 1000 in 1970 to 8.50 in 2020 (Kendall's $\tau = - 0 . 8 6 7$ p two-tailed $= 0 . 0 1 5$ . As displayed in Fig. 1, modals, that-complement clauses, and stance adverbials all experienced a significant decline in frequency over time (Kendall's $\tau = - 0 . 7 3 3$ P two-tailed $= 0 . 0 3 9$ ; Kendall's $\tau = - 0 . 8 6 7 , \mathtt { p _ { \mathrm { ~ t w o - t a i l e d } } } = 0 . 0 1 5$ , and Kendall's $\tau = - 0 . 8 6 7 _ { \textrm { i } }$ $\mathtt { p _ { \ t w o - t a i l e d } } = 0 . 0 1 5$ , respectively). The results suggest that stance features declined in the medical RAs within the 50-year span.

The finding that stance devices fel in the medical RAs from 1970 to 2020 demonstrates that the downward trend of stance features starting around 1900, which was found by Biber (2004), sustained and continued in the recent 50 years. Although this downward trend is in line with the relevant findings in soft disciplines, it contrasts with the findings in hard disciplines that showed an upward trend in the use of stance features diachronicall (e.g., Gilaerts & Van de Velde, 2010; Hyland & Jiang, 2016; 2018a; Deng et al., 2021).

Medicine has a complex scientific status because it straddles the boundary between hard disciplines (e.g., biology) and soft dis ciplines (e.g., psychology) (Fltum et al., 2006), . Furthermore, medicine is oten regarded as both a cience and an art as it involves objective measurement as well a clinical experience and judgement (Fryer, 2022). Medicine is not an exact science (Rowley-Jolivet, 2019) because the research subjects (patients) are complex and many of the variables are not quantifiable, yielding findings that are not always just a matter of objectively observable facts (Malterud, 2001; Rowley-Jolivet, 2002). Possily due to these reasons, studies investigating medicine have variably found that medicine is similar to hard' or "soft disciplines, depending on the features under investigation. For example, stdes of citation sugest that medicl cience is simiar to hard disciplines, with relatively fewr explicit references than other discplines (e., Fltum et al., 2006). I contrast, studies of epistemic modality and hedges suggest somewhat "softer" medicine, with a frequent use of uncertainty expressions (e.g., Yang et al., 2015).

Another notable inding is that the three types of stance devices decreased at dfferent rates. Modals and stance adverbials declined to a less extent than that-complement clauses. The modals and stance adverbials declined by $2 3 . 3 \%$ and $2 0 . 7 \%$ respectively, which was much lower than that of that-clauses $( 4 8 . 8 \% )$ . The variations in the extent of decline may indicate medical writers' preference for "economy of expression (Biber & Gray, 2016, p. 207; Vold, 2006). There are two possible reasons. First, the use of modals and stance adverbials are syntactically and morphologicaly les comple than that of that-lauses, and hence re more economical in signaling the same stance meaning (Hyland & Jiang, 2016). Second, the use of modals and stance adverbials is simpler than that of that-clauses, which does not involve selections of tense, aspect, or voice. In contrast, the use of that-complement clauses requires making such choices and is thus more complex (Wu & Pan, 2023). Our results suggest that the medical RAs might shift away from the relatively more complex stance structure, e.g., the use of i semed possile that (), towards the relatively simpler and more economical ways of conveying stance meanings, e.g., the use of stance adverb possibly (6). This change is in accordance with the current writing style in medical science that encourages brevity and simplicity of conveying information (Taylor, 2018).

4.2. Changes in the functional/syntactic categories of stance devices

4.2.1. Modals Modals declined in the medical RAs within the 50-year span, fallin from 6.03 per 1000 words to 4.63 per 1000 words. The gradual decline of modals in the medical RAs is largely consistent with previous studies (e.g., Biber, 2004). For intance, Biber (2004) found that modals in medical prose experienced a general decline from 1900 to 1990 (falling from roughly 10 per 100 words to around 5 per 1000). Our study ads to the finding by showing that the decline of modals in the medical proe continued, but i has gradually slowed down in the recent 50 years. Some other studies documented a roughly similar changing pattern in the use of modals in a wider range of genres (e.g, Leech, 2011). For example, based on the Brown and LOB family corpora, Leech (2011) found that modals were constantly decreasing in frequency during 1901 and 2006 and the decline accelerated around the middle of the 20th century. Our result showed that the medical RAs followed the general downward trend in the use of modals.

In addition to an overall decline of modals, the three functional categories of modals decreased as well in the past 50 years (Fig. 2) Specificall, ar slight ncrse, thy gdually deind in the last 30yr. nly possiity/ssion/aiit catry iplayed a significant decline (Kendall's $\tau = - 0 . 8 6 7$ P two-tailed $= 0 . 0 1 5$

# 4.2.2. Stance adverbials

As mentioned, stance adverbials declined in the medical RAs falling from 1.67 per 1000 words to 1.3 per 1000 words from 1970 to 2020. The declining tendency of stance adverbials in the recent 50 years generally agrees with Biber's (2004) finding that stance adverbials in medical prose declined from 1900to 1990 (dropping from roughly 5 per 1000 words to around 2 per 1000). The results suggest a cumulative and gradual decrase of stance adverbials in the medical RAs since 1900, but the decline has gradually slowed down in the five decades.

Although stance adverbials in the medical RAs exhibited a clear downward trend, the four functional categories of stance adverbials did not paint a homogeneous picture in their evolution. As shown in Fig. 3, afer an initial increase, the four functional categories started to diverge around 1980. Communication stance adverbials underwent a significant increase (Kendall's $\tau = 1 . 0 0$ $\mathbf { p }$ two-tailed ${ < } 0 . 0 1 { \dot { \mathrm { ~ } } }$ , whereas the other three functional categories declined, with certainty and likelihood stance adverbials dropping significantly (Kendall's $\tau = - 0 . 8 6 7$ P two-tailed $= 0 . 0 1 5$ ; Kendall's $\tau = - 0 . 7 3 3$ P two-tailed $= 0 . 0 3 9$ , respectively). Results showed that the four functional categories of stance adverbials changed in opposite directions over time. While communication stance adverbials increased in frequency since 1980, the other three categories decreased. Based on a fine-grained analysis, our study pinpointed the moment of change as well as divergence between functional categorie. As no reearch in medical cience so far has explored the diachronic use of stance adverbials in terms of functional categories, our findings need to be verified in future research.

# 4.2.3. That-complement clauses

That-complement clause declined significantly in the medical RAs during 1970 and 2020, fallig from 4.96 per 1000 words to 2.54 per 1000 words. The decreasing tendency is generally consistent with that observed by Hyland and Jiang (2018b) who found that the decreasing use of that-clauses has ben uniform across the examined disciplines. However, compared with Hyland and Jiang's study, results showed that the medical RAs constantly used far fewer that-complement clauses than RAs from each of the four disciplines over the period. Some previous studies also found that medical science employed significantly fewer that-complement clauses than other disciplines (e.g., Kim & Crosthwaite, 2019). Taken together, these results suggest that medical science is ess likely to employ eal. uative that-clauses than other disciplines. One possble reason is that, ealuation in medicine, especially evaluation of the findings of previous studies, seems to be often expressed through non-integral or non-reporting forms (Kim & Crosthwaite, 2019.

As shown in Fig. 4, verb-controlled that-clauses, noun-controlled that-clauses, and adjective-controlled that-clauses declined significantly in frequency over the past 50 years (Kendall's $\tau = - 0 . 8 6 7$ $p$ two-tailed $= 0 . 0 1 5$ ; Kendall's $\tau = - 0 . 8 6 7$ $p$ two-tailed $= 0 . 0 1 5$ Kendall's $\tau = - 0 . 8 6 7$ A $p$ two-tailed $= 0 . 0 1 5$ , respectively).

The three types of that-complement clauses in the medical RAs declined in frequency over the five decades, but they differed in the change rates. Verb-controlled that-clauses dropped by $4 2 \%$ , which was much lower than those of noun- and adjective-controlled thatclauses ( $7 0 \%$ , and $7 4 \%$ respectively). Verb-controlled that-clauses declined to a lesser extent than the other two syntactic types, which echoes the finding of Hyland and Jiang (2018b). Proportionall, the percentage of verb-controlled that-clauses out of allthat-clauses increased from $7 6 \%$ to $8 7 \%$ This increase resonates with that observed by Hyland and Jiang (2018b) who also found a slight increase inthe perntage of verb-controlled that-clauses. In addition, they also founddisciplinary differences in the changes of verb-controlled that-clauses, with the soft disciplines undergoing a large increase while the hard disciplines being fairly stable. Our result suggests that the diachronic use of verb-controlled that-clauses in the medical RAs was more similar to the soft disciplines than to the har disciplines.

Fig. 4. Three types of that-clauses over time.

As shown above, verb-contolld that-clauses declined to a leser extent thannoun-and adjective-controlled that-clauses from 1970 to 2020 and the proportion of verb-controlled that-clauses even increased. Such changes may be related to the versatil roles of controlling verbs. First verbs, especiall reporting verbs, are one of the clearest signals f stance marking (Charles, 2006) and they are frequently used to referto diffrent kinds of activitie or processes involved in medical research and to serve diferent rhetorical functions (Thomas & Hawes, 1994). Second, compared with the other two types of that-clauses, verb-controlled that-clauses provide more choices in expressing multi-layring of stance (Charles, 2006). On the contrary, noun-controlled that-clauses draw on a relatively restricted range of nouns (Biber et al., 1999) and adjective-contolld that-clauses mainly occur in the form of extraposition, with the dummy it as the evaluative source (Gray & Biber, 2015).

# 4.3. Changes in stance markers

While the three types of stance devices decreased in the medical RAs over time, it is unclear how individual stance markers in the functional/syntactic categories change. One way to seek answers to this question is to take a more lexicographic perspective on these stance devices. In this section, we explored the changing patterns of stance markers within functional/syntactic categories. Due to space limitations, we focused on the most frequent subcategory of each stance type: possbility/permission/ability modal, communication stance adverbials, and verb-controlled that-complement clauses.

Within the possbility/permission/ability category, the four modals did not change uniformly. While may and can decreased substantially over the recent 50 years, might and could increased considerably. From 1970 to 2020, the percentage of may out of all possibility/permission/ability modals dropped by $2 8 \%$ (from $4 7 \%$ to $1 9 \%$ , and can fell slightly (from $1 8 \%$ to $1 5 \%$ . In contrast, the percentage of might grew by $1 4 \%$ (from $^ { 1 3 \% }$ to $2 7 \%$ , and could rose by $1 8 \%$ (from $1 6 \%$ to $3 4 \%$ ). Although the four modals all convey a stance of possbilit, pemission, or abilit, they rarely express reques for permission in academic discourse (Poole et a., 2019). In the medical RAs, they typically conveyed possility or abilit, though sometimes it was firly dificult todistingush them clearly. In the case of expressing possbility and ability, modals might and could indicate greater degre of uncertainty than may and can (Biber et a., 199). In this earl period, medical witers were inclined to use can and may to xpress possbility meanings (7-8), while writers of recent periods tended to employ more might and could (9-10). The opposite changing paterns of the four modals may reflec shift away from modals that express greater certainty towards those that carry more speculations and uncertainty.

(7) If this i so, we can anticipate that there will be some degree of unreality in many or our parents handing of the problem since their factual knowledge is inadequate. (1970)   
(8) Moderate to severe hypertension may actually reduce cerebra flow by evoking excessve autoregulation relative to the pressure. (1970)   
(9) This decrease could be asociated with historical reductions in exposure to cardiac radiation, particularly among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. (2020)   
10) The differences in these results might be explained by differing ways of measuring aortic diameter. (2020)

Within communication stance adverbial category, stance markers also evolved in the opposite directions. The majority of stance markers declined i frequency (e.g., typicall, mainly, and generally from 1970 to 2020, most of which allows writers to describe the manner that information is presented or is to be understood, or to modify a proposition (Conrad & Biber, 200). For example, generally in example (11) limits the generality of the proposition. Only one stance marker, according to, increased in frequency (by $1 3 4 \%$ ) and its occurrences out of all communication stance adverbials rose by $3 0 \%$ . According to, an epistemic stance marker in stance adverbial category (Biber et al, 199; Conrad & Biber, 200), indicates where the information comes from. As shown in example (12), by attributing information to widely accepted rules, principle, criteria, and practices, medical writers "appeal to authority (Bolinger, 1990, p. 230) and justify their choices. Thus, the changes in the use of communication stance markers may indicate that medical writers are les likely to qualify the generality of propositions and are more likely to appeal to the source's authorit as a justification for claims than before.

(11) As expected, the attack rates generally declined with advancing age of the patients. (1970) (12) Details f each dressing applied in the trial were recorded and classified according to British National Formulary classification. (2020)

Under the category of verb-controlled that-complement clauses, controlling vers did not change in the same direction as well. Most controlling vers declined in use, particularly demonstrate, conclude and state, which conveys a high level of certainty (Biber et al. 199. By contrast some contrling verbs that expres ucrtainty increased in use. For example, as the most frequent ontrolling verb from 1970 to 2020, suggest increased in frequency, with its proportion out of allverb-controlled that-clauses growing by $3 \%$ . The controlling verb hypothesize did not ocur in 1970, but i began to emerge in 1990, and finll became the top 11 verb controlling that-clauses in 2020. The decreasing use of certainty controlling verbs (13), in contrst t the incrsing use f uncertainty stance vers (14-15) may suggest that medical writers became more tentative in evaluating the propositions embedded in that-clauses than before. The finding partly agrees with Hyland and Jiang's (2018b) study, showing that biological writers became more measured in their stance towards the propositions in that-complement clauses over time, while electrical enginers showed greater certainty.

(13) We conclude that the abnormalities found in our patients were the result of a deficiency of vitamin D.

# 5. Discussion and conclusion

The study examined the changing patterns of three major types of grammatical stance devices in published medical RAs between 1970 and 2020. It showed that the thre types of stance devices declined in frequency over the years and all the functioal/syntactic categories (except communication stance adverbials) of stance devices decreased as well In tems of the lexical relizations of stance, stance markers indexing certainty declined in use, while stance markers expressing uncertaint increased. These results indicate two major trends in the diachronic use of stance devices in the medical RAs, which will be discussed below.

The first trend is that stance features declined in the medical RAs, as evidenced by a decrease of each stance type and their functional/syntactic categorie. The downward trend may suggest that medical writing tends to become les interpersonal and more informational over the past 50 years. One evidence is that the informational' scores (Dimension 1 of Biber's Multidimensional analysis) of our medical RAs have increased continuously since 1970 (seeappendix C), indicating that medical RAs have progressively displayed a higher information focus and a lower interaction over time. Previous diachronic studies of medical prose and scientific writing also oserved similar results (e.g., Atkinson, 1996, 2001; Biber & Finegan, 2001) For instance, Biber and Finegan (2001) found that medical RAs have graduall shifted towards a more informational and les interactive style from 1650 to 1990and Atkinson (2001) observed that scientific writing has grown steadily more informational and les involved from 1675 to 1975. Our finding also resonates with previous synchronic observations that medical texts tended to rely on unmodified statements of fact or exhibit experimental results as accredited fact rather than utilize stance devices (Biber, 2004; Kim & Crosthwaite, 2019).

The tendency that medical academic writing becomes les interpersonal and more informational over time may be pertinent to the knowledge construction mode in medical science. Medicine belongs to the world of cience where the ideal of scientific objectivity stands strong" (Vold, 2006, p. 237) and medical RAs are more concerned with providing factual information and les with overtly expressing atitde. ompard wth other disciplines ., linguistcs, medicinei uque in its emphasis onjectivity and avoidance of interperonal features (lum et l., 2006). I sems that this uniquenes is becoming more pronounced when there has been a shit towards laboratory- and experimental-based medicine (Rowley-Jolivet, 2018) where new medical claims are increasingly constructed through hypothesestesting, large-scale experimentation and observation, as well as randomized-controlled trials. Such epistemological conventions generally allow for more factual data descriptions characterized by methodological rigor, experimental justified arguments, and evidence-based conclusions (Carter Thomas & Rowley-Jolivet, 2008; Choura, 2019) rather than subjective interpretations and interpersonal interactions. Furthermore, the quantification and mathematical modelling of data in recent years enables medical texts to be ideologically neutral and relatively objective (Fryer, 2022). As more factual and objective information is provided in the medical RAs, the use of interpersonal features such as stance devices may decline. This tendency generallyfollows the changing patterns documented by Gross et al. (2002) who notice that the representation of science has evolved as an objective enterpris through astyle incresingly designed to direct readers atention to factual information in the laboratory and the natural world between the 17th and the 20th century.

Second, the diachronic changes of stance markers within the functional/syntactic categories indicate that medical writers tended to adopt a more tentative and cautious stance than they did in the past. The finding contrasts with that observed by Poole et al. (2019) who showed that biochemical writers tended to signal a high level of certainty towards propositions throughout time. The discrepancies may be due to the fact that their research was based on a specialized corpus of RAs focusing on one topic. As relevant studies advance the particular field, researchers gradually reach consensus on understanding the phenomenon and accept propositions as facts, and hence the need to convey uncertainty reduces. Differentl, our medical corus covered a wide range of topics, representing the latest advances in medical research. Hence, knowledge clams tended to be tentative and cautious over time, which are subject to objections and future revisions. This finding may be related to the growing unpredictability of medical cience and the increasing complexity of medical research. First, medical science turns to be more unpredictable as it is ever expanding, evolving, and entering new domains of inquiry (Salager-Meyer, Alcarza Ariza & Luzardo Briceno, 2013). This unpredictability often requires medical writers to present their findings as inconclusive and interpretations as uncertain. Second, medical research has grown more methodologically complex over time (Salager-Meyer, Alcarza Ariza & Luzardo Briceno, 2013), which often involves large-scale and complicated experiments and the research subjects are often human beings that cannot be experimentally manipulated. Owning to the complexity of research subjects, medical writers usually \*speculate about the state of an infinite population through sampling research with some degree of possbility" (Yang et al., 2015, p. 6). Furthermore, factors, such as sample size, imperfect measuring techniques, and other uncertainties in the experimental process ofen lead to tentative knowledge claims (Hyland, 2006). Therefore, medical research conclusions are usuall indicative and it is much more dificult or even impossible to draw definitive conclusions (Carter-Thomas & Rowey-Jolivet, 2008; Yang et al, 2015). Partly because of the two reasons, medical writers tend to employ more linguistic resources to suggest the possibilit or sketch a rough picture rather than to convey a high degre of certainty, especially when they explore the uncharted research frontiers.

Our study found that medical writers tended to use fewer stance features and make more tentative knowledge claims over time. which has useful pedagogical implications for instructions in English for medical purposes (EMP). These trends need to be explicitly explained in the context of the disciplinary epistemologies in the EMP classoom and writing programs. A conscious understanding of the recent style shift in medical RAs would help students and novice writers make informed decisions when balancing interpersonal strategies and propositional statements in writing, make convincing claims of their research, and construct stylistically appropriate medical RAs. EMP practitioners could use specialized corpus of published medical RAs to demonstrate how medical writers construct new knowledge and persuade readers through an objective and tentative presentation of their claims. Blank-fllig exercises (in which stance features are removed) could be designed and provided to the students, so that they could compare their own choices with those of the published writers.

Though the present study provided a fine-grained analys of the diachronic change of overt stance devices in medical RAs, several issues ned to be adresed in fure stde. irst as ur stud is based excusively on the three maor tes of stance device, it would be useful to incorporate other stance devices (e.g., to-complement clauses and stance noun $^ +$ prepositional phrases) in future diachronic research, which may provide a fuller and a more comprehensive understanding of stance use in academic writing. Second, tracing the changing patterns of overt stance features i just one way of exploring the multifaceted nature of interpersonality in academic texts. Other perspectives, like studies on evaluation (e.g., Hunston & Thompson, 2000) and metadiscourse (Hyland, 2005a) may yield additional insights.
