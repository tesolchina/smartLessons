Parascientific genres often do not abide by the established norms and conventions of science communication in research articles (RAs) and they are not included in the RA. This work examines the linguistic and communicative exigencies of an emerging digital genre, the Bigger Picture, an obligatory post-publication section in the journal Chem which deviates considerably from RA norms, yet it is included in the RA. This work aims to examine its rhetorical functions and determine users initial perceptions: rhetorical analysis of twenty Bigger Picture sections in Chemistry RAs in Chem, a survey and an interview were conducted to determine users' perceptions. Novice researchers/writers were also asked to write think aloud reports as part of the qualitative analysis. The analysis of the genre moves and featuring conventions showed an intentional blurring of boundaries between scientific and general discourse, technical, nontechnical and inter-disciplinary communication which gives rise to a new more inclusive 'metascientific' genre. Participants agreed that the Bigger Picture's main purpose is to involve, engage and reach out to a wider audience, adapting a discipline-specific discourse and re-contextualising research outcomes from a highly specialised context to a nominally specialised one, using recontextualisation strategies which aim to include a broader pool of potential interdisciplinary users.

# 1. Introduction

RA genres and sub-genres are not just conceived as highly structured and conventionalised communicative events (Bhatia, 1990, p. 13), they areaso deemed to be constantly evolving as inherently dynamic rhetorical structures that can be manipulated according to the conditions of use (Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995, p.6). With the advent of digital genres and their dynamic and non-linear exigencies and affordances, genre evolution (Miller, 2012) genre variability and change (Paltridge & Starfeld, 2020; Swales, 2019; van Enk & Power, 2017) and genre currency and erosion (Sancho Guinda, 2015) are now more than ever discussed by EAP researchers; in this sense, genres should not be limite to superior or inferior (Wood, 1998, p. 142), based on expert and non-expert discourse.

Erosion of the boundaries between expert and non-expert discourse realms is evident in para-scientific genres' (Kelly & Miller, 2016) that tend to "operate without the gatekeeping and traditional reporting forms of internal science communication' (Kelly & Miller, 2016, p. 231). The literatre is ife with analyses of emerging digital genres that ae considered parascientific, including blogs (Luzon, 2013), which borrow "scientific authority and knowledge structures from the realm of science." (Kell & Miller, 2016, p. 231). Parascientific genres are not endorsed by or incorporated within research publications, as \*they are not subjected to the filters of interal, formal scietific communicatin" (Mur-Duenas & Lores, 2022 p. 14). Yet various types of digital summary now seem to be an integral part f scinific papers in a wide range of disciplines and feure as evolved reresentations of expert knowledge dssminated in the RA. Some examples f emerging part-genres that are included in the research paper are the author summary analysed by Breeze (2016), research highlights (Akbas & Farnia, 2021; Lindberg, 2004) and the Bigger Picture analysed herein. In my view, these add-on summaries should not be considered parascientific just because they use different rhetorical strategies, promotional language, popularisations or the "narrative of society" (Wood, 1998, p. 140). As will be argued later in this article a difference in aims, correlated with a difference in moves and embracing a social orientation that prioritises relevance to a wider societ (Wood, 1998) over research rigour, objectivity and empirical scrutiny, can empower and include a wider audience and may constute features of a new genr las.

Genre-centred teaching about RAs often assumes that Chemistry RA's have a particular IMRD macrostructure Stollr & Robinson, 2013; Swales, 1990). This study examines the science communication trajectory of a digital Chemistry RA part-genre, i.e.the Bigger Picture, which similar to other digital Chemistry RA part-genres, e.g. research highlights and graphical astracts, does not always tally with Swales's IMRD macrostructure. Given this addition of sections that are native in digital research artices (RAs) and the demarcation of the context in which a digital genre is situated (Xia, 2020, p. 151), EAP practitioners should not be so prescriptive When teaching about the RA genre. Changes to the RA macrostructure are also due to context ollpse' a term coined by Marwick and Boyd (2011) which happens as the result of addressing an imaginary online audience which is 'not stati, geographically bound or intrinsicall institutionalised' but assumes some degree of collctive knowledge' (p. 129). The emerging genre examined in the current study also seems to be created for an imaginary audience with some degree of collective and technical knowledge. It seems to promote new disciplinary practices which are located within the research article itself but, unlike twitter posts and blogs, it cannot really be regarded as 'parascientific' because it retains some degree of technical integrity.

Davis and Jurgenson (2014) further theorise context collapse and divide it into two categories, context colision and context collusion. Colision is defined as unintentional bluring of context boundaries, one that may subsequently minimise or maximise boundary enforcement depending on users. Collusion involves intentional meshing of social contexts afer platform design and user practice combine. As such, collusion serves as a means of including even novice Chemistry researchers, who, for example, tend to operate within a polycontextual disciplinary realm. In other words, as online users, they navigate through traditional genres, such as primary reearch article or new emerging parascientific genres, such as twitter or blogs, in order to read, reearch, synthesie, edit, summarise, paraphrase or adapt information in them, and these very ocial activities and practices can foster further transformation of existing typified gres. In an attempt to include broader cientific audiences and similar to these new online genres, the Bigger Picture opts to embrace polycontenxtualit and as such it gives acces to a wider audience whose layrs of understandings and expertise cannot just be dichotomised in terms of experts and non-experts (Perez-Llantada, 2021).

Now more than ever, highly indexed Chemisty journals such as Chem are promoting open acces dgital papers, and inclusion and transparency are being adopted as key strategic goals. Although traditional and printed journals journals used to have a fixed \*stableenough-for-now (Shryer, 1993: 229) status, structure, content and lexical choice, some digital RA's are now adopting more dem ocratic or popularised part-genres such as the Bigger Picture which features in Chem. These part-genres are tailored to the needs of a science-oriented but lestechnical audience b using a varity of incusive rcontexalisation strateges. I this paper, I adopt uzon's (2017) definition of recontextualised scientific discourse regarding weblogs, which Luzon describes as harnessing the affordances of the medium to rewrite specialised knowledge in such a way that [a] complex audience [..] can interpret and integrat it into their existing knowledge and feel involved enough to make informed decisions' (p. 429). This description seems to embrace notions of engagement and inclusion; recontextualisation gets non-expert users or readers acquainted with a rather unfamilia expert genre so that they can make informed decisions following awareness-raising.

As outlined in the journal guideline, an effective Bigger Picture' should provide the reader with the answers to the following questions: \*Why i the earch importnt? What are the longer-tem mbition f th rerch? Do th rerch ave the otntil nth short or long tem to make an impact on society?" (Chem Author resources, 2021). According to the journal, the aim is to render fundamental research in Chemistry comprehensible to non-experts mainly by minimizing technical jargon, and to show how findings could posi. tively affect society in the future. t should o be noted that although ealuative language is generall frowned upon in Chemistry RAs (Robinson et al., 2008), acording to the author guidelines (Chem Author resorces, 2021), using evaluative language like spectacular or exceptional' in order to position and promote research is not only allowed but also anticipated in this part-genre.

The emergence of this popularised scientific genre form may be reinforced by the need to include wider near-expert audiences in the same way as other similar add-on genres, like the \*Author summary" (Breeze, 2016). Add-on genres are often interconnected with other genres in the RA, i.e. the astract or the inroduction, thus forming genre assemblages (Devitt, 2009) within a variety of genre ecologies that are either interdependent or competing with each other. Luzon (2013) and Luzon and Perez-Llantada (2019) emphasise the role of recontextualisation strategies as inclusive practices in digital genres. In the context of the Bigger Picture, re-mediation across genres is evident in the form of intertextuality when the earlier words are recontextulised, and thereby given new meaning in the new context (Bazerman, 2004, p. 90). It i also evident in the form of interdiscursivity which becomes apparent when expert and non-expert iscourses are fused (Gott, 2014; Mott-Roth & Scherer, 2016). These iscourse fatures seem to be used as tools to help people to get things done (Dirk, 2011, p. 252) and as social actions (Bazerman, 1994) that empower users to navigate through or even compose divere enre repertoires. In this way, context collapse in the form of collusion serves s an inclusie tol in rearch articles.

Many scientific journals ask researchers to promote their research contributions in the field and \*sell their product (Martin & Leon Perez, 2014) using promotional language in social media. However, the promotional strategies featuring in digital RA's do not seem to be the outcome of publication presures (Ferguson, 2007; Lilli & Curr, 2010; Uzuner, 2008) nor the underlying globalisation and marketisation pressures of the highly competitive environment of scientific publishing (Lindberg, 2004). Instead, they seem to be an attempt to include a complex audience whose knowledge and understanding of scientific content i high but who are not expert enough to be fully engaged with thecontent. o makescintific discourse more accessible, recontextualisation strategies such as bosters often make explicit the writer's atitudes toward the content (Vande Kopple, 1985; Crismore et al., 1993; Hyland, 2005a; Dafouz Milne, 2008) and facilitate the interaction between the author and the expected readership, even in traditional genres. Other recontextualisation strategie, however, may also be as indicative of genre dilution since they re-word, exemplify or condensescientific content to make it more comprehensible, accessible or appealing to broader audiences. Although genre dilution may be considered to be putting a stake the very \*interity of the discourse (Bhatia, 190, when coupled with gre collusion, it may wellsrve as adynamic inclusive tool in research articles and promote not only understanding but also genre awareness.

Genre pedagogy has been theorised extensively by several opposing 'schools' and genre awareness (Johns, 2008) or 'explicit knowledge of a genre's linguistic and rhetorical conventions' is advocated by ESP and EAP practitioners as it facilitates the process of learning to write efectively (McGrath & Kaufhold, 2016, p. 936). Such genre awareness can be applied to new emerging genres including popularised or promotional genres. Lindberg (2004), as well s creating promotional genre taxonomies, also stressed the need to provide adequate pedagogical scaffolds of promotional tools for both experts and novices so that they can navigate the competitive RA discourse successully. This is exemplified in the webpages and featured articles of the journal Chemistry Teacher In tenational (Blonder & Mamlok-Naaman, 2019) and Chemical Education (Shuffebarger & Scot, 2020) that daw on the need to include senior high school or undergraduate students and engage them with recent research findings. ikewise, authors guidelines in Chem journal inform that research findings no longer serve a minority of academics, but schol students and undergraduate students who are not the most ovious readers of RAs; f they are the ones the jounal is reaching out to, they are not the default readership the jounal is trying to reach beyond and engage. Interestingly, although traditionally the representation of the general public understanding of science has been described in terms of deficit (Wood, 1998, p. 131), we now see an explicit sift in terms of a \*sociall realistic framework" (Wood, 1998, p. 139) that does not operate outside but in parall to scientists' authorit, and commitment tocertainty, precision and control.

In line with all the above, I am drawing an analogy with aromatic Hydrocarbon substituents (Fig. 1) suggesting that the Bigger Picture should not be classed as a parascientific genre but as a meta-scientific one featuring genre inclusion in the form of collusion, context collapse and recontxtualiation strtis. As is discrnble in Fig 1, if s the primary reearh conducted in vivo and ortho is the conventional research article following expected established norms, and if para corresponds to para-scientific publications that stand outside the primary rearch article and the ream of what s pure science (), i. twitr or blogs, then th Biger Picture and all emerging genres that are integrated in digital research articles could be classed as meta-scientific.

This study aims to examine what the users perceptions of this academic and professional genre are, ollowing genre analysis The research questions examined in this work were:

1. What rhetorical moves and discourse elements are apparent in the Bigger Picture?   
2. What is the primary purpose of the Bigger Picture genre in digital Chemistry research articles?   
3. How do experts-in-the-field and novice researchers perceive the usefulnessof the Bigger Picture compared to other genres?

After having defined the current academic and professional writing context, the methodology, the corpus and categories of analysi. are presented in order to answer these questions regarding our object f study, The Bigger Picture. After presenting and analysing bott quantitative and qualitative data, I aim to discuss the implications of relevant research and practices.

# 2. Study design, corpus and course design

The corpus was derived from open-archive primary research Chemistry articles in Chem, a journal which encourages the merging of original research publications on Chemistry topics with interdisciplinary applications (see Appendix A). The Bigger Picture is composed by the authors afer the manuscript has been approved for publication by the reviewers and it features as a new genre in all published papers since 2018. The corpus comprised twenty top-cited or most-downloaded open-access Chemistr-rlated research articles in Chem. Its small size $( \mathbf { n } = 2 8 6 3$ words) allowed for a better focus on disciplinary contingencies regarding form, content, scope and functionality, and it was also more manageable by novice researchers and professors who acted as informants. In fact, this study integrates textual analysis (section 2.1 and 2.2) and qualitative perception data (section 2.3) using an anonymous questionnaire, an interview and student think aloud reports.

Course design: Ten students (novice Chemistry researchers/writers with limited publishing experience, working towards thei. MSc or PhD) attended a genre-based English for Specific Academic purposes course, which allowed me to adopt a narrower angle and address each learner individually. The course used task-based reading-to-writing aproaches which involved noticing the moves in model texts from established genres (astract, introduction, discussion), deconstructing model texts with established genres and identifying their moves, writing a comparative analysis of moves identified in thre discipline-specific papers, bending the rules and adapting the moves of some genres while sharing their work and feedack with their peers. The syllabus was organized around the completion of an Academic English for cience portfolio, designed to engagestudents i a simple scientific inquiry, gathering data to complete the tasks. Students produced comparative textual rhetorical analysis and a multimodal analysis for visual elements, and wrote think aloud reports regarding the steps they followed, the skill required and the challenges they faced.

# 2.1. Rhetorical analysis

For the rhetorical analysis, I used a grounded theory aproach (Glaser and Strauss 1967) with a coding scheme whose categories were not predefined and whose codes were generated from the data (Appendix B) before each Bigger Picture move and purpose was identified (Table 1). To decrease th inevitable degree of subjectivity and measure inter-rater reliability, a second reearcher from the discipline of Chemistry was asked to conduct the same classification and coding process. There was $9 6 \%$ consistency between the researchers.

For the move analysis of the Bigger Picture genre I drew on the move framework of Chemistry RAs by Stoller and Robinson (2013), and to some extent the biochemistry RA moves framework proposed by Kanoksilapatham (2005). As some moves in this emerging genre are comparable to established part-genres (Dudley-Evans, 200) in the research articles, i.e. abstract and introduction, I made some direct comparisons of their moves. For comparison, Swales' moves in more general IMRD models (1990, 2004) were also taken into consideration due to some similarities to move 1 of the discussion section in Swale's framework.

# 2.2. Textual analysis

I also analysed recontextualisation strategies employed to adapt information to meet the needs of an assumed non-technical audience, who lack expertise. Following Luzon (2013), I examined whether these strategies were used for audience engagement, for promotion or both. I examined each move and its promotional teps in terms of prominent content, and rhetorical, lexical and grammatical frequencies (Table 4) so as to identify strategies for audience engagement and collusion. For example, using non-specialised lexis instead of discipline pecific words may be a re-contextualisation strategy to include a broader audience, but also constitutes a promotional strategy.

# 2.3.  Qualitative perception data

Following Bhatia's (2005) ethnographic research recommendation, an anonymous questionnaire (google forms) was administered to potential users, who completed it acting as informants. Group A $( \mathbf { n } = 1 0 )$ ) consisted of Chemistry professors and Group B $( \mathtt { n } = 8 )$ consisted of novice researchers, i.e. Chemistry students that were either post-graduates or PhD candidates, attending an optional technical (Chemistry) writig course that required a comparative analysis of the igger Picture and other sub-genres in the same RA.

Participants were asked four questions:

4. Which thee of the follwing digital features do you find most useful for your work? (Graphical abstract, Hyperlinks, The Bigger   
Picture, Research Highlights, Video, Recommended Articles) Why?   
5. To what extent does the Bigger Picture meet the needs of an expert audience?   
6. To what extent does the abstract meet the needs of an expert audience?   
7. What kind of skill does a young researcher need to develop in order to write/compose the Bigger Picture genre ffectively? Why?

The first question aimed at identifying how useful the Bigger Picture is compared with other digital genres in the same RA. The second and third questions aimed to check whether this genre addresses the needs of experts-in-the-field, young researchers and/or non-expert. These three questions also shed light on the purpose and the comparative satus of the Bigger Picture and the astract as regards expertise, importance and relevance. The last question regarding esential sill for the composition of this gere was expected to shed light on the scope of this genre and ways to promote awareness raising.

Following the completion of the questionnaire, the same Faculty members participated in a $1 0 { \cdot } \mathrm { m i n }$ semi-structured interview which aimed at verifying the data collected in the questionnaire. Faculty were asked to elaborate when responding to the questions:

1. What is the primary purpose of the Bigger Picture?   
2. Is it useful for your work?

The novice researchers who participated in this study had never published a Chemistry journal, so they were interviewed at the end of a genre-based technical writing course as they had never composed the section Bigger Picture before. They were also asked to complete think-loud rorts to compare the Bgger Pcture ctions i three RAs with ther prt-nres of their choice i. abstract or research highlights) in the same RA, drawing generalisable conclusions regarding purpose, structure, content and language (Appendix C).

# 3. Analysis of the Bigger Picture corpus

Table 1 summarises the moves and promotional steps, and their frequency in each Bigger Picture section. Opening and closing moves were identified, and move frequencies, obligatory moves and move sequences were manually annotated (See Appendix B). Drawing upon three analytical frameworks for move analysis (Swales, 1990, 2004, Robinson and Stoller, 2013 and Kanoksilapatham,

2005), textual boundaries between moves were identified. Table 2 summarises how moves in the abstract (Robinson and Stollr, 2013) compare to the Bigger Picture moves, while Table 3 summarises moves identified in introduction and discussion sections (Kanoksi lapatham, 2005; Robinson and Stollr, 2013; Swales, 1990, 2004), with highlighted sections indicating similarities with the Biger Picture.

As regards the first move in the Bigger Picture, Placing the research rea in  wider ontext authors sem to be making a first effort to recontextualise the content of the research by providing clear and meaningful background generalisations and claims that indicate the centrality of the topic within a wider context that can serve as a common point of reference to a non-expert audience. As such, the following examples indicate topic centrality that clearly connects with real world needs or ssues.

Example 1:

A) Renewable energy (e.g., solar and wind) can make a significant contribution to meeting the increasing global energy demands. (Text 2, appendix A)   
B) This work is an important step toward the biomedical implementation of functional materials of relevance to the radio. pharmaceutical industry, nano-medicine, and early detection of cancers. (Text 5, appendix A)   
C) Aromatic hydrocarbons contribute an important fraction of volatile organic compounds (Vocs) in the urban atmosphere; not only are these directly harmful to human health, but they are also a class of precursors of haze particulate matter. (Text 9, appendix A)

A tendency to link the research to real world contexts, to demonstrate need for the research, has been noticed in other studies of traditional RA introductions (Samraj, 2002; u & Nesi, 2017). Yet, although the rhetorical functio of move 1, Establishing he centrality of the topic in a wider context in the Biger Pictre is similar to that featuring in abstracts and inroductions in the sameRA it lexical configurations unfold themselves in adifferent way to move 1 in introductions and abstracts (Example 2), where there i no mention f real world problems or needs.

In fact, the purpose of the move is similar but the linguistc relisation is different, as the authors in the Bigger Picture employ a plethora of strategie in order o talor the text to the needs of an assumed general audience whose technical background is unspecified and cannot be pre-determined. More specificall, move 1 in the Bigger Picture is more abridged than in the introduction, yetit is not neesrily ore onci . l assf cror f, ftio mtr f relen to. tis mre ae . he64oistope vs radio pharmaceuticals) and more jargon-fre as it makes use of everyday (renewable energy, biomedical implementation, uban atmo sphere), ealative and romotional language (. canmake  sgniicant onriution, is an mortant stp, coriute n mprtan raction of). Unlike RA introductions and similar to RA abstracts, the Bigger Picture ection does not include any citations and does not review or make any direct reference to the previous literature. Also, parenthetical information is used to provide examples of even general terms (see example 2). As comprehension of the research area seems very important in move 1, analogies and examples can increase

the proximity of the research (Example 3).

Example 3.

Separation processes are ubiquitous in industrial processes. Porous solids can be employed in, for example, fixed beds or mem branes, to reduce the energy for separations in relation to processes such as distilltion (Examples in Text 4, Appendix A). Functional groups are the "cities' on a map of mechanistic pathways (the \*roads"), and chemists use functional groups as pivot points to valuable chemical intermediates (Analogy in Text 20, Appendix A).

Move 2, Establishing the importance of common problems (not the research gap), features in more than three quarters of the selected Bigger Picture texts. It constitutes a second effort to recontextualise the way experts tend to identify research gaps. As seen in the following examples, the second move sometimes starts with an adversative logical marker (i.. however) that clearly shows potential failures, disadvantages or limitations of previous research.

However, its successful penetration into the existing electrical grids requireseffective energy-storage solutions to overcome its intermittence. (Text 2, appendix A)   
... however, this type of material sufers from structural amorphism, which limits fundamental studies on their tructural optimization for enhanced adsorption performance. (Text 5, appendix A)

Although move 2 in the Bigger icture sms similar to move 2 in Introductions as regards its rhetorical unction, this does not seem to be the case when it comes to lexical choices. Example 5 shows how the lexical choices in the second move feature [or not] in the abstract, introduction and the Bigger Picture of the same research paper. As we can se, this move is further abridged and does not contain in-depth justification or any negative clams. Layman explanations are provided which may remind an experienced reader of rather unsubstantiated hand-waving arguments" that have traditionall been considered highly undesirable in a Chemistry paper (Robinson and Stollr, 208). As it can be see in Example 2, authors use quantitatie data to substantiate their claims i the abstract, and citations to substantiate their claims in the introduction. This is not the case in the Bigger Picture.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Example 5</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Genres</td><td>Move 1 examples</td></tr><tr><td>Bigger Picture</td><td>Renewable energy (e.g. solar and wind) can make a significance contribution to meeting the increasing global energy demands.</td></tr><tr><td>Introduction</td><td>Steadily increasing utilisation of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power requires affordable and sustainable energy storage technologies at good scales up to MW/MWh 1,2,3 Redox flow batteries (RFBs) represent one of the promising battery technologies to overcome the intermittence of renewable energy and supply reliable renewable electricity to grids. 2,3 Simultaneously, implementation of renewable electricity can significantly address the dependence of diminishing fossil fuels and their adverse environmental impacts.</td></tr><tr><td>Abstract</td><td>Aqueous organic reduce flow batteries (AORFBs) are highly attractive for large-scale energy storage because redox-active organic molecules are synthetically tunable, sustainable, and potentially low cost.</td></tr></table></body></html>

In move 2, the authors also avoid tentative language (i.e hedging) as another persuasive and promotional strategy that intensifies the disadvantages of previous research. In fact, authors tend to be more cautious in move 2 in the RA introductions as they either provide acitation or an explanation, a concession, a modal verb (should, may or can) or adverbs such as commonl, solely, usuall or usually to mitigate the strength of a potentilly asolute argument. Compared to introductions, the Bigger Picture only sparingly features examples of cautious language in move 2.

Last but not least, another recontextualisation strategy is the use of generalisation and vagueness In example 6, when reporting problems, the introduction raises specific causes of structural amorphism whereas the Bigger Picture summarises these issues as $\cdot _ { a }$ type of material with structual amorphis omitting the causes and focusing only on a negative result The use of vague language would seem undesirable in other parts of a typical Chemistry research articl. Despite being traditionally frowned upon, lack of "explanatory depth? (Maier & Engberg, 2019), lack of pecifit or the use of vague justifications can be perceived as an attempt to increase the research articles' proximity to a non-specialised interdisciplinary audience thus creating rapport and a common ground.

Example 6.

Introduction: \*the effctive adsorption of trace aromatic hydrocarbons demands high adsorption affinity between the adsorbates nd the MOF adsorbents even in competition with the water vapour co-existing in the air.

Move 2a in the Bigger Picture refers to generalisable non-technical problems, as the focus is on establishing the importance of the research in terms of problems solved not the research gap. There is minimal reference to methods or quantitative evidence, which indicates a clear departure from move 2 in astracts. Furthermore, move 2b provides explanations, examples and analogies to establish importance in an attempt to make the content understood by non-experts.

Higher degrees of rhetorical promotion $\mathtt { \Omega } _ { \mathtt { n } } = 5 6$ , Table 1) are evident in move 3, Explain why and how you value the findings, in which authors make explicit positive ealuations in their attempt to explain how their rearch contributes in the feld or solves a previously mentioned issue or limitation. They overtly state the value of their research using positive evaluative words like a new generation, important, cutting-edge, simple, precise, clear, a game changer' (Example 7).

Example 7.

A new generation of aqueous organic RFBs utilizing sustainable and tunable redox-active organic molecules has emerged as a game changer for electrochemical energy storage. In the present study, we report a clas of rationally designed highly reductive and high-charge capacity redox-active viologen molecules as a clas of two-electron storage anolyte materials .. (Text 2, appendix A)   
. We found that carbon nanotubes have the ability to redirect the trajectory of radiochemicals, which can lead to the in vivo imaging of the lung. This research supports the hypothesis that it is possible to use cuting-edge imaging techniques [..] The conceptual advance of our findings isthat they can also act as scaffolds for the encapsulation of positron emitting radioisotopes in water, and their subsequent supramolecular wrapping leads to a diminished toxicity. [..(Text 5, appendix A).   
. We demonstrate that rationally designed metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) show advantages in the capture of aromatic VOCs over carbon-based adsorbents, such as high adsorption capacity and a clear structure-performance relationship. Precise single. crystal structures of the MOFs and relevant VOC-loaded MOFs ... (Text 9, appendix A)

These positive evaluating comments are always acompanied by self-reports i.e. we' and/or reporting verbs such as 'demonstrated, reported' and 'show advantages', which report the principal outcomes of the research in an overt and confident way. These two features combined indicate the use of a powerful persuasion elements f forward-looking language and subjectvity (we, promise, promising, a game-changer) with elements of objectivity, in the same section (i.e. demonstrate, rationally deigned, precise). Also, cautious language (e.g. suggest) seems to be les prominent in this move which may serve as another persuasive promotional strategy. Although objective, confident reporting verbs are invariably used in abstracts, move 3 differs from the abstract in that it features evaluative and promotional language instead of dry quantitative evidence to support claims.

Move 4, Stating positive implications and impact on societ, also serves as the closing move in the Bigger Picture. Commenting on positive impact and making connections to the real world, abroader field, the environment or society seems to be the main function of this move (Example 8).

Example 8.

. .] aclassof two-electron storage analyte materials that promise aqueous organic RFs with high voltage, high power density, and high energy density. (Text 2, appendix A)   
. The broader significance is that this work provides a simple and rapid approach to nanomedicine in water and addresses sig nificant radiosynthetic and imaging challenges. (Text 5, appendix A) .. new opportunities are presented to manipulate its conversion to new outcomes.(Text 20, appendix A)

Move 4 sems to feature positive evaluative adjectives i.e high, rapid) combined with forward-looking lexi in the form of verbs e. g.promise, noun-phrases i.e. new opportunities, or modals: can be achieved'. This combination seems to constitute another recontextualisation strategy as these features are not as prominent in introductions, discussions or conclusions in these RAs and are only optional in abstracts. Also, clear difference between the Biger Picture and the abstract is that the implications and evaluations are positive, which is in line with the explicit instruction provided in author guidelines for the Bigger Picture. Table 2 shows the dif ferences in moves in abstracts and the Biger Picture. Despite an apparent similarity regarding their organisation, moves in the iger Picture are clearly different from moves in the astract, mainly due to the recontextualisatio strategies employed. The Bigger Picture moves seem to be expanded versions of abstract move 1, introduction move 1 and discussion move 1 (focusing on evaluation).

Fig. 6. Young researchers responses to the question \*To what extent does the Bigger Picture meet the needs of an expert audience?".

So far, the four moves have been analysed as regards their rhetorical function, lexical choices, promotional strategies and recontextualisation strategie see summary in Table 4). To further examine whether these rhetorical strategies and lexical choices led to more inclusive, popularised genres or the dilution of established scientific genres, we looked at how experts in the field and young researchers use and perceive this new digital genre.

# 4. Qualitative analysis of perception data

# 4.1. Expert and expert-in-the-making perceptions of the Bigger Picture

The inclusivity of the Bigger Picture and its communicative and functional aspects were verified by the ten experienced Chemistry Professors and the ten young Chemistry researchers/novice writers. Respondents in both groups agreed that it helped non-experts understand the impact of the research and its interdisciplinary aplications. Its promotional status was mentioned by thre Faculty members while genre dilution was stated only by one Faculty member, during the interview. Genre dilution was not implied or stated by the novice researchers.

Fig. 8. Visual representation of the purposes of the Bigger Picture as perceived by experts.

4.2. Comparison of the Bigger Picture to other kinds of digital innovation in chemistry RA's and the abstract faculty responses

To further examine the purpose of the Bigger Picture, the faculty members were interviewed regarding its purpose and why they thought it was included in the journal. Fig. 2 shows that Faculty members $( 8 0 \% )$ deemed the Bigger Picture to be the most useful digital innovation compared to other digital inovations in the journal. Regarding the questions examining whether the Bigger Picture meets the needs of an expert audience (Fig. 3), itis clear that Faculty members did not consider that the Bigger Picture exclusively addressed an expert readership compared to their response about the abstract (Fig. 4). The abstract/summary, a more traditional genre, was thought to exclusively meet expert needs by $8 0 \%$ of the faculty members whereas the Bigger Picture did so by less than $6 0 \%$

4.3. Comparison of Bigger Picture to the digital innovation in chemistry RA's; young researchers' responses

Unlike the faculty members, the young researchers considered non-textual innovations in the journal such as the Graphical ab stract, and textual inovations such as the research highlights, another add-on genre, as more useful than the Biger Picture. The Bigger Picture was rated third among other digital innovations (Fig. 5).

In response to the question To what extend do the Biger Picture and the abstract meet the needs of an expert audience?", i is clear that the young researcher agreed with Faculty that the abstract/summary, a more traditional genre, meets expert needs to a greater extent than the Bigger Picture (Fig. 6, Fig. 7).

# 4.4. Essential skills for the composition of Bigger Picture

Regarding the skill novice writers need in order to compose the Biger Picture, the young researchers mentioned understanding and awarenes of the broader field, reading relevant literature, and the abilit to identify the key findings and place them in a wider context. They also stressed the need for good synthesis skill, critical thinking (pros and cons, prioritising what is important) and comparison with other relevant genres such as the abstract (Appendix D, Table 2).

4.5. Interview: faculty members'responses to the question "What is the main purpose of the Bigger Picture?"

Table 1 in Appendix D shows a selection of verbatim Faculty responses. Emergent themes regarding the purposes of this genre included awarenes of how this work connects with ther work in the same or other interdisciplinary fields. It was thought to erve as a road map regarding relevant literature and comparable results, to fine-tune and enhance understanding of the rationale behind the work as wellas potential applications and benefits, and finally to aim to attract the interest of new researchers in the field.

The concept map in Fig. 8 summarises emerging themes based onall faculty members interview responses regarding the purpose of the Biger Picture (Fig. 8). Student responses and faculty responses were congruent although the former did not mention the promotional aspect of the Bigger Picture.

4.6. Interview: Novice researchers' responses to the question "What is the main purpose of the Bigger Picture?"

Students who were asked to compare Bigger Picture sections in three articles and comment on their usefulnessrported similrities in terms of scope, i.e. applications and impact on society, comparable to those reported by professors. However, students who did not compose the genre after the comparison did not seem to be too keen on it as they valued traditional genres such as abstract and introduction as more important and useful. Students who compared and then composed a Bigger Picture section for a new Chemistry article had similar views indicating similarity among astracts itroductions and conclusios: it s a very good summary, to." [S_7]. These students could see how the Bigger Picture differed from other summary-like genres in the paper:

The very first time I saw it, I wondered why we need this if we have the summary. But the rationale for a paper that is ifficult like the ones we did, truth is, it isessential, so, for example, someone who is not aware of the paper's topic might read the abstract without understanding i at all whereas with BP it mentions more general stuff socil aplications, i becomes more ccessible to the readers (S_4].

These observations indicate that this genre is another layman summary that enhances science understanding (Kuehne & Olden, 2015). Students also agreed that the Bigger icture establishes the centrality of the main topic identified in the rhetorical analysis and hey also noticed that this genre is more vague and thus les useful for experts than other part-genres that traditionall provide a seneral background in the research article, such as introductions.

# 4.7. Novice researchers' think aloud reports relating to the Bigger Picture

Students' think aloud reports were also analysed and compared to the Faculty responses and rhetorical analysis findings. Students focused equally on content, lexical choices and purpose. The following student entry was selected as the most indicative of their comparative analysis. The jaon-fre account (not usingtchnicl tems), the valuativ nture f the senences (beng mostly deendent on the logic hind reult nd not th nmbers), the sentes which e upported y th rus/idee inthe paper (ay qualitivel and artill tily t   t thd h th  wile af this  re stated in this section' (Appendix C, Student entries in think aloud reports).

The majority of students $\left( \mathbf { n } = 6 \right)$ noticed similarities between the abstract and the Bigger Picture, consistently showing awareness of the expected target audience and readership: almost all the students stated that the main purpose of the Biger Picture section was to address the neds of non-expert. Astriking difference in their reflections is that although none f the conventions, content or lexical features noticed by novices were considered to be promotional ones, there were two entries that perceived the overal purpose to be promotional:

Entry 1 "... help the reader decide if he is going to continue reading the paper'.

Entry 2 "... in order to catch the eye of the reader, as this section is the first thing they see."'

# 5. Discussion

Rhetorical analysis showed that the add-on remediated genre of the Bigger Picture in Chem journal is indicative of inter. connectivity between traditional part-genres and new genres in RAs. More specifically, the Bigger Picture move 1 shows similarity with move 1 in Inroduction in the aforementioned analytical frameworks (Tables 1 and 3) but the message is abridged and broader. The Bigger Picture also seems analogous to the discussion move (Swales & Feak, 2004), Interpret your data by making suggestions as to Why your results are as such', where consolidation of research space is of primary importance especially when it indicates how it is integrated in the field or how i conects to the real world. Journal editors in Chem invite their authors to explain a. Why the reearchis important, b. What the long-term ambitions of this research are, and c. How their work can impact society. Given these similarities acros various part-genres, i ems gemane to argue that ontex collase materialises itelf through inter-discursive features within the expert discourse of the RAitelf (Luzon and Perez-Llantada, 2019; Perez-Llantada, 2021; Sal0 & Hanell, 2014) rather than outside the RA as a para-scientific genre. Similarl to other add-on digital geres (Breze, 2016), move 1 in the Bigger Picture situates the research in a wider context and constitutes a recontextualisation.It aims to start from a common point of reference with a perceived near-expert readership (Gotti, 2014). Also, the Bigger Picture resembles other emergent add-on genres like the author summary analysed y Br 2016)in tht when ompard with the astract i sems toe utilizg ffet lexial relstions . aluative Ianguage, summaries or generalisations) despite the lack of overt intructions in the author guidelines (Chem Author resources, 2021).

The rhetorical analys of the corpus (Table 1), users responses and the student think aloud reports allsugest that the addition of a social dimension to the research outcomes increases the article's proximity and relevance to a non-specialised audience, a finding which is consistent with Bondi et al. (2015). Rhetorical analysis showed that similar to the weblogs analysed by Luzon (2013), sci. entific discourse is recontextualised in order to reach out to a diversified audience. The strategies used included adjusting lexis and recontextualising content to the readers' background knowledge and expertise, abridging content and making explicit positive evaluations in order to increase proximity (Example 2 and Example 5, Table 4). This blurrng of audience boundaries between the scientific community and an assumed general radership (Gros & Harmon, 2016; Luzon and Perez-Llantada, 2019) may account for broader meaning-making, by positioning the authors speculations about the impact of their research in an inclusive way. According to Hyland (2015), discourse communities may enhance proximity by reflecting shared social representations of the ways things are done'. Alternatively they may allow for authorial positioning through discourse appropriation to help authors 'make a name for themselves and stand out from the crowd (Davies & Harr, 1990). In the same light, Bhatia regarded positie and favourable evaluations and descriptions as promotional strategies for \*product differentiation' (2005:4). Also, consistent with Bhatia (2005) is the notion of promotional genre colonies since positive evaluative language and descriptions are also evident in the first move of abstracts and introductions (Table 4).

This interrelatednes of part-genres within the RA brings forth changes in positioning and proximity which may indicate a tendency of digital geres towards what Marwick and Boyd (2011) or Davis and Jurgenson (2014) cll\*context collapse", but wthout putting at stake the very \*integrity" of the discourse (Bhatia, 1990). Although both faculty and young researchers acknowledged that the Bigger Picture is avery useful genre, it does not exclusively address the neds of the expert audience Fig. 2 and 5) and this dos not upset the established hierarchy of the abstract as a traditional part-genre (Figs. 3, 4, 6 and 7). The rhetorical and lexical analysis of each move and its recontextualisation strategies may serve as a way to reach out and engage with a more diverse audience. More specifiall, highly-technical language and technical details were avoided, key ideas were summarised and evaluatie language was explicitly used, yet these strategies were not consistently perceived byall participantsas synonymous with \*context ollapse" or the dumbing down of technical content. This may imply that context collapse is the outcome or the means of reconfiguring disciplinary boundaries. Also, the corresponding genre is materialised in a remediated form, and may be perceived either as trivialise, indicating gere erosion, or as adopting a more enveloping form as a means of reaching out and engaging with divers readers of scientific research, i. genre inclusion' In fact, one Faculty member mentioned that this genre may at firs seem \*trivialised, although it may sere some purpose to novice rearchers or reearchers in other fields .g. idustrialists'. Acording to most Faculty responses (Appendix ), the lexical and rhetorical choices in this genre have been remediated in order to include a wider audience, and reach out to inter-disciplinary alignments with other researchers. Also, divergent views of the genre's integrity, purpose, audience and engagement potential may be due to different perceptions of the genre itelf among established members of the same discourse community, in this light, emerging genres are often viewed as indicative of audience clash when some experts prioritise established conventions as rules to be followed, While others perceive the RA as a means of engagement and outreach potentially bridging the gap between layers of understanding among a multitude of diverse yet knowledgeable audiences that are addressed as "experts-in-the making" (Breeze, 2016, p. 63).

The recontextualising strategies presented in this paper were identified by faculty members who mentioned them as criteria outlined in the authors guidelines or "composition skill (Appendix D). These included concisenes, abridgement, simplicit when it comes to lanage, a well as novelty, usulness eficieny and ustinility when it come t cope and purose ee skill as well as critical thinking, synthesisig, concise writing and awarnessofthe broder applications in the litrature or sciety did not indicate context collpse but rather a callfor inclusiveness and trans- or inter-disciplinary alignment. According to two Faculty members interdiscursivity in online para-scientific genres such as twitter feds or blos may have contributed to the emergence of this genre. This indicates the interplay betwen genre and digital media that are found outside the research article. Also, applications for funding and research proposals often employ similar promotional strategies to describe the Bigger Picture and the broader impact of their research, as reported by a novice researcher. Most importantly, with the addition of the Bigger Picture, the functional importance of promotional strategies in reearch articles is now not limited to RA introductions and abstracts. Promotional stratgies are riterated in this new section so as to increase the paper's outreach and discoverability in social media, leading to more trafic and downloads and hopefully citations as stated in author guidelines). I fact, the Bigger Picture was considered as a promotional genre y three out f ten faculty members (Appendix D) although promotion was not considered as prevalent as other purposes that this section may serve (Fig. 8).

This study shed light on the perceptions of this communit of practice of Chemistry professors and young researchers and verified the existence of a covert hierarchical ranking of old genres like the abstract, which is considered more important, while new reme. diated genres like the Bigger Picture are considered less important. It also found that hierarchical ranking is evident among the digital add-on genres; the Bigger Picture was ranked as the most important by professors and as the third most important by young researchers, who ranked the multimodal gere of Graphical abstractatthe top of the list instead. Given the perceived salience of this add on genre (Fig. 3 and 6) and the fact that, to some extent, it was considered as promotional, i seems germane to suggest that the gap between perceived hierarchies and social rhetorical purposes of add-on genres may indicate a gap between those who are wellestablished agents in the current research community and those who might aspire to enter it. The salience of the graphical abstrat for the young researchers may also indicate differences in praxis between expert and expert-in-the-making audience or ifferences in how they perceive multimodal semiotics in the RA. For example, young researchers prioritising a non-textual dd-on genre like the Graphical abstract may indicate that the merging of semiotic modes (visual and textual) is perceived as conducive to meaning-making by providing aces to diffrent layers of understanding. This may also mean that the uptake of merged multimodaladd-on genres is higher for young researchers than for their professors.

The survey and interview findings seem to indicate that discourse communities are often perceived as an interface of engagement (Wenger, 1998) rather than commitment (Hyland, 2015), and following Luzon (2013), the recontextualisation and engagement strategies presented herein may feature a persuasive rhetorical practice evident in the lexical choices that seek to affct an audience's evaluations of the research paper with the use of ealuative language see in move 3. In other words, lack of specificit or jargon may increase proximity to a non-specialised audience, as this new genre seems to be intentionally designed as a popularisation discourse (Calsamiglia 2003) bridging the gap between the scientific and the generic, whil re-contextualising scientific content without vul. garising it. As a re-vamped popularisation discourse, it aims to engage and guide the reader through the paper, undertaking an interactive and evaluative function that can reveal the writer's overt or covert atitudes toward the content using meta-discursive language (Vande Kople, 1985; Crismore et al., 1993; Hyland, 2005a; Dafouz Milne, 2008). The Biger Picture includes objective topic-based units and subjective evaluation based units (Luzon, 2013) coupled with textual metadiscourse markers such as logical connectives (transitions), code glosses (examples and analogies), frame markers (This work aims to, Our purpose is, and interpersonal metadiscourse markers such as emphatics (In fact) or self-mentions (we) that have been classfied by Hyland (2005b) as interactive and interactional resources, respectively, and as such emphasise this genre's engagement potential.

Although awarenes-raising and pedagogical implications of genre pedagogies are not the primary scope of this research, student responses regarding purpose, content and language were not only articulate but also congruent with the rhetorical analysis and faculty members' responses. The validity of comparative reflections of students indicated that involving them in inquiry-based comparative explorations of authentic contexts and asking them to compare genre sets (Devit, 1991), genre chains' (Bazerman, 1994), gene constelltions' (Swales, 2004) or genre colonies (Bhatia, 2005) within a given discipline-specific social contex can be a valuable genre pedagogy strategy which \*can be employed to realise situated purposes and also reap the enefit of reding-writing integration" (Hyland, 2004, p. 157). Raising students awareness and employing reading-writing integration in the current practice allowed me, as an EAP/ESP practitioner, to examine how student productions may bend the rules' (Cheng, 2014) and, instead of just presenting model geres to young reearchers, young researchers/novice writers can be encouraged and scaffolded so as to adapt genres, . meet the expectations of other discourse practices instead of just \*performing (Devit, 2015). This was an integral part of the genre-based course students attended. Also, combining the reading-to-writing approach with writig a comparative analysis of digital genres, and writing think-aloud reports involved students in reflctive exploratory practices which tally with Qin and Ucelli (2016) and Yayli (2011) who acknowledge the need to move genre pedagogy focus from genre awareness to cross-genre awareness. Also, as student observations were comparable to those of their professors, focusing on the leaner noticing traectories asking students t eflect on the gap between what is noticed and their own composition/output (Cheng, 2006) have led to increased genre awarenes. Awarenes-raising processes in ESP genre pedagogy seem toallow learners to gain gradual insights into situated context and genres; young researchers were exposed to genre-based comparative analysis, they were asked to notice moves in Chemistry journal papers. they reconstructed traditional and digital genres whose moves had been deliberately jumbled up, composed new genres and then compared them with published ones, and deliberately bended genre rules and provided each other with per-fedback without being conditioned in an apprenticeship approach (Belcher, 1994).

# 6. Conclusion

The competitive field of Chemistry or scientific writing in general may have pushed journals to eek \*inovative formats to capture fresh audiences" (Bree, 2016, p. 62) and their atempts may e perceived as superficil y experts in the field (Perez-Llantada, 2013). Similar digital innovations may initially be deemed to account for the dilution' of the genre as they are often employed as an intentional drive to push trafic towards new ool f redership, yet they also serve as inclusion straties that tlor rhtorical moves, content or lexis towards a potentially non-specialised interdisciplinary audience with an interest in the research topic. EAP practitioners and researchers should grasp the opportunity to analyse recontextualisation strategies in research article sub-genres and examine overt and covert awarenes-rasing opportunities and the pedagogical implications of these new genres. These pedagogical interventions of situated activity routinely involv[ing] semiotic performances that are re-represented and re-used across chains of activity' (Prior, 2013, p. 527) may facilitate future social action enacted by cross-genre awareness.
