# Introduction

The emergence of Generative AI marks a pivotal moment in the history of artificial intelligence, exerting a profound impact on human society. It has the potential to match or even surpass human intelligence in certain domains, utilizing deep learning algorithms to generate coherent text, visuals, and audio (Byrne, 2023). While it streamlines routine tasks for knowledge workers, it also demands continuous learning to adapt to evolving technologies (Ramos et al., 2023). As the cornerstone of talent development, education is now confronted with unprecedented opportunities and challenges in this dynamic landscape (Chang & Kidman, 2023).

The integration and utilization of Generative AI present remarkable prospects for the development of education. In particular, the incorporation of cutting-edge Generative AI has the potential to transform the learning process, enabling students to gather information, analyse their learning progress, personalize their learning experiences, and foster effective collaboration (Nikolic et al., 2023; Yu & Guo, 2023).

This not only enhances student learning and engagement but also supports educators in instructional design and research by providing valuable teaching methodologies, customized curriculum development, and resource creation (Murugesan & Cherukuri, 2023). Furthermore, the integration of Generative AI into learning systems aids in the creation of intelligent learning environments, providing personalized, diverse, immersive, and real-time services (Karabacak et al.,

2023; Waisberg et al., 2023). In conclusion, Generative AI holds immense promise for educational applications.

However, the adoption of Generative AI in education also brings forth a range of concerns and challenges. First, the use of Generative AI by students for assignments and papers can give rise to a phenomenon known as “high-tech plagiarism”, which undermines the principles of educational equity (Chomsky et al., 2023; Emenike & Emenike, 2023). Second, Generative AI might disrupt traditional teaching models and the role of educators (Gentile et al., 2023), particularly if it becomes central mode of interaction, potentially undermining teacher-student engagement (Gonzalez et al., 2023). Additionally, the extensive data input required by Generative AI opens up possibilities for security breaches and privacy violations (Tlili et al., 2023; Yu & Guo, 2023). Finally, it may trigger issues like technological dependency, unequal access to educational resources, intellectual property concerns, and distortions in educational values (Franceschelli & Musolesi, 2022; Lund & Wang, 2023).

Given the educational opportunities and challenges posed by Generative AI, there has been considerable research interest in examining the current state and future prospects of Generative AI in education. A number of scholars have actively explored this field. For instance, Shoja et al. (2023) conducted a thorough literature analysis to assess the state of Generative AI in medical education, shedding light on its strengths and limitations.Yu and Guo (2023)extensively examined the current state, issues, and prospects of Generative AI in education, summarizing key research topics through a comprehensive literature analysis. Similarly, Kohnke et al. (2023) conducted a literature analysis to investigate the application of ChatGPT in language teaching and learning, unveiling its applications, potential benefits, and challenges.

While previous studies have investigated the applications of Generative AI in education, there is still a need for a comprehensive and precise review. Many existing studies rely on surveys and literature analysis, which may not provide a complete understanding of Generative AI in education. Bibliometric analysis, a methodology that utilizes statistical and data visualization techniques to quantitatively analyse published literature, can offer a more comprehensive perspective (Bogolyubova & Lovakov, 2023). In this paper, we use bibliometrics to analyse literature on AI in education from Web of Science Core Collection. The objective of this analysis is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current status and trends of Generative AI in education, offering a critical viewpoint and a reference for future research and practice while addressing two specific research questions.

Research Question 1: What is the current state of research on Generative AI in the field of education, including publication dynamics, research contributors, collaborations, and significant literature?

Research Question 2: What are the research focuses and frontiers of Generative AI in educational research?

# Literature review

# Bibliometric analysis

Bibliometric analysis quantifies, tracks, and analyzes academic publications, compiling authors’ works, pinpointing leading journals, clarifying research methods, and summarizing research outcomes (Pradana et al., 2023). Key bibliometric methods encompass citation, collaboration network, and thematic analyses, applicable across academic disciplines (Donthu et al., 2021). Bibliometric analysis has been employed in numerous studies to present comprehensive overviews of research areas, such as the application of artificial intelligence in electronic health records (X. Chen et al., 2018), event detection in social media (X. Chen et al., 2019), fuzzy research (Cobo et al., 2011), business (H. Chen et al., 2012), educational technology (Zawacki-Richter & Latchem, 2018), and STEM (Assefa & Rorissa, 2013). This approach facilitates understanding of disciplinary evolution, topic shifts, and publication significance, offering valuable insights to academics (Gimenez et al., 2018). Recently, there has been an increase in bibliometric studies on Generative AI in education, focusing on understanding its development and specific applications. For instance, Bowles and Kruger (2023) explored optimal student engagement with Generative AI, finding it can transform and enhance students’ thinking, creativity, and critical skills. Oh and Kim (2023) merged literacy education with Generative AI, noting that while literacy education may risk a literacy crisis, there’s an imperative to navigate new transformations in the digital and AI domains. Consequently, it is essential to undertake more detailed and extensive research into the application of Generative AI in education.

# Generative AI

Generative AI, powered by deep learning technology, employs algorithms, models, and rules to mimic human creative thinking and generate coherent and logically structured textual, visual, and audio content (Dwivedi et al., 2023). Generative AI traces back to the 1950s with Hidden Markov Models and Gaussian Mixture Models, initially used for sequential data such as speech (Reynolds, 2009). Deep Learning has significantly advanced generative models (Cao et al., 2023). Generative AI has made significant strides across healthcare, natural language processing, creative arts, and finance. Specifically, it aids disease diagnosis in healthcare (Koohi-Moghadam & Bae, 2023), automates text summarization in natural language processing (Anderson et al., 2023), fosters innovation in creative arts (Pedersen, 2023), and predicts market trends in finance (Dowling & Lucey, 2023). Moreover, Generative AI significantly influences education by personalizing resources and activities, thereby increasing engagement and learning efficiency (Ellis & Slade, 2023). As a leading force in educational reform, Generative AI boosts both the quality and effectiveness of learning, actively engaging students and deepening their understanding and creativity. It also optimizes resource management and improves the overall efficiency and sustainability of educational systems (Xing, 2023). This focus on Generative AI is set to continually support and advance educational methodologies and innovations (Presswire, 2023).

# Materials and methods

# Data sources

In December 2023, this study accessed the Web of Science (WOS) core database to collect Generative AI literature in education, limiting searches to English articles. Employing the PRISMA framework ensured systematic and reliable literature identification, selection, and evaluation (Page et al., 2021), as depicted in Figure 1. Initially, 700 papers were retrieved, and after careful manual screening, 305 were selected for detailed review.

# Research methods

This study employs bibliometric analysis, focusing on citation, co-occurrence, and journal analyses as primary methods. Citation analysis investigates inter-citation dynamics, including defining the research scope, creating a citation database, and evaluating citation relationships and metrics (Rousseau et al., 2018). Co-occurrence analysis discerns field relationships and focal points by examining the frequency and context of shared keywords, themes, or authors, leading to the construction of matrices and visualization of relationships (Kiili et al., 2023). Journal analysis assesses publication patterns and networks by identifying influential journals and analysing their metrics and trends (Mongeon & Paul-Hus, 2016). Bibliometrics quantitatively analyzes citation relationships, author collaborations, and topic development trends, uncovering research focuses and hotspots in a field. This methodology provides a comprehensive and in-depth research perspective, clarifying relationships between topics and the current state and future trends of subjects (Zupic & Čater, 2014).The research methodology workflow is illustrated in Figure 2.

# Research tools

This study utilized CiteSpace and VOSviewer for bibliometric analysis in educational Generative AI research. CiteSpace (Chen & Wise, 2023), developed by Professor Chaomei Chen using JAVA, is widely used for hotspot analysis, offering multi-perspective co-occurrence analysis and visual mappings of research relationships. VOSviewer (Eck, v., & Waltman, 2023), created by Leiden University’s CWTS, excels in visualizing large bibliometric networks with its strong graphic display capabilities.

We employed CiteSpace to gather data on publications, authors, institutions, and keywords, creating visual maps of collaborative networks. VOSviewer was used to produce national cocitation maps, co-cited reference networks, and keyword clusters, making full use of both tools’ strengths for a comprehensive visual analysis.

# Results

# Overview of publication

# Publication dynamics

Publication volume serves as a crucial metric for gauging developmental trends and forecasting future directions in a field (Bornmann & Mutz, 2015). Figure 3 illustrates a year-on-year increase in generative AI research in education, peaking significantly in 2023. Since the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI on 30 November 2022, a large number of have been formally published in the field of Generative AI in education. This trend underscores Generative AI’s emergence as a research focus in education, attracting growing scholarly attention. Therefore, exploring Generative AI applications in education will become an important research area.

# Most productive journals

Journal analysis is an essential approach for revealing the influence of journals in a particular field (Dzikowski, 2018), and citation analysis is a key method for reflecting on important scholars and classical literature in a specific domain (Lin et al., 2021). Therefore, this study analysed all journals and citations in the records. As presented in Figure 4, the average citation counts of each relevant study in the journals are visually represented by a colour gradient from yellow to purple, indicating the average citation counts of journals from high to low. Table 1 presents the highest-producing journals in various educational studies using Generative AI. Among them, Cureus Journal of Medical Science (17 articles with 44 citations), Annals of Biomedical Engineering (14 articles with 12 citations), Journal of Chemical Education (6 articles with 5 citations), Sustainability (5 articles with 9 citations), Journal of Public Health (3 articles with 1 citation), and Education and Information Technologies (3 articles with 1 citation) are the six journals that simultaneously ranked in the top ten for both publication and citation volumes. This indicates that these six journals are more interested and have received more attention for research on Generative AI in the field of education. They reflect the current research focus as well as development of further research on Generative AI in the educational domain. Although journals such as Cureus Journal of Medical Science, Sustainability, and Journal of Public Health do not fall directly within the field of education, they have demonstrated interest in topics related to medical education, bioengineering education, and environmental education. Therefore, we have included them in our study.

Figure 7. Map of co-authors network.

# Analysis of authors

Authors’ publication volume, citation count, and collaboration network are crucial indicators for analysing and understanding research in the field of Generative AI in education (Fu et al., 2021). Figure 7 presents the collaboration network of 59 authors depicting that some authors have formed their own collaborative teams. Among them, the largest collaborative network in the figure comprises authors such as Sasha Nikolic (2), Sarah Lyden (2), Scott Daniel (2), and others. Their close collaboration establishes a solid foundation for research on Generative AI in education.Additionally, a notable subnetwork involves a core group of ten authors, led by Haiyang Wu (6), who collaborate closely and have produced a significant number of publications.For instance, Nikolic and colleagues collaborate to explore the relationship between ChatGPT and engineering education assessment, analysing the effectiveness of this Generative AI tool in assessing integrity. Through case studies and insights, they offer important contributions for benchmarking and analysis across various disciplines and institutions (Nikolic et al., 2023).However, this collaboration network reflects relatively dispersed collaboration among researchers in this field. These collaborative teams primarily operate within their respective sub-networks, having limited interaction with author groups outside their subnetworks. This indicates that there is room for improvement and strengthening of global research collaborations in Generative AI applied to education.

# Co-citation analysis

Co-cited literature often represents the core knowledge and key research advancements in a specific field (Rawat & Sood, 2021). CiteSpace’s reference co-citation analysis allows us to study the knowledge foundation of existing literature by describing their co-citation relationships (Huang et al., 2020).

Figure 8. Map of document co-citation network.

Figure 8 illustrates the co-citation network of the literature in the field of Generative AI for education. Each node represents an article cited in the network, and the node size is proportional to the number of citations received. Larger nodes indicate higher citation counts. Purple highlights the nodes with a high betweenness centrality. Nodes with high betweenness centrality represent important cited literature that plays a significant role in research on Generative AI in education. In Figure 8, the most cited article is “Language models are few-shot learners” (Brown et al., 2020). This study revealed the remarkable performance of large pre-trained language models, such as GPT-3, in few-shot learning tasks. This implies that these models can learn new tasks with few samples, demonstrating their important generalization capabilities and application potential. Furthermore, this research has triggered in-depth reflections on the application and potential impact of large NLP models in intelligent systems. Table 2 displays the top ten most cited articles. These articles are considered key papers in the field of Generative AI in education.

# Hotspot topic analysis of generative AI in education

This theme includes keywords such as chatbot (44), large language model (41), machine learning (24), natural language processing (21), deep learning (13), training models (12), and reinforcement learning (5). Remarkable breakthroughs in core Generative AI technologies such as NLP, machine learning, large language models, deep learning, and reinforcement learning have catalysed innovative applications in the educational sector. First, natural language processing (NLP) advancements have led to more intelligent and personalized educational methods. These systems now better understand and respond to student queries, offering precise, tailored guidance (Abd-Alrazaq et al., 2023). Notably, intelligent assistants, virtual tutors, and automated grading are among the applications that have significantly benefited from NLP’s evolution. Second, machine learning has revolutionized educational intelligence, providing personalized learning recommendations and optimal paths tailored to individual student profiles by analysing extensive data (Iskender, 2023; Li, 2022). These intelligent systems enhance learning outcomes and reduce teacher workload. Furthermore, advancements in large language models have improved comprehension and response generation in education, notably in dialogue systems and virtual assistants. Such models facilitate natural, fluid interactions, offering bespoke educational support and enabling students to have engaging, lifelike conversations with AI (Jeon & Lee, 2023). Furthermore, breakthroughs in deep-learning technology have enabled greater intelligence and automation in education. For example, image generation techniques make virtual experiments and scenario simulations possible, allowing students to conduct experiments and experience a virtual environment (Marcato et al., 2023). Intelligent teaching videos using deep learning technology achieve content auto-captioning and sentiment analysis, and offer more interactive and personalized teaching experiences (Chaudhry et al., 2023). The application of reinforcement learning technology has resulted in a more intelligent teaching experience in the education sector. Intelligent tutoring systems and learning path planning can use reinforcement learning to implement more effective learning strategies and instructional decisions (Wesendrup & Hellingrath, 2023). These applications make the educational process more flexible and personalized, thereby enhancing students’ autonomy and proactiveness in learning.

# Issues and challenges arising from the application of generative AI in education

As presented in Table 3 and Figure 9, the third research theme is the issues and challenges arising from the application of Generative AI in education. This theme includes keywords such as ethics (13), academic integrity (9), plagiarism (6), challenges (4), human-computer interaction (4), and trust (3). Generative AI’s integration into education has escalated pressing concerns regarding copyright protection, academic ethics, technological ethics, and teacher-student dynamics. Initially, ChatGPT, a sophisticated chatbot leveraging large language models, creates text almost indistinguishable from human writing, raising serious academic integrity issues like plagiarism and ghostwriting (Lee, 2023). Studies show that ChatGPT, in open and online exams, could undermine academic integrity with its ability to deliver critically and logically sound responses, potentially facilitating cheating (Rahman & Watanobe, 2023). Moreover, this assistance in academic dishonesty could disrupt the fairness of educational assessments and exacerbate inequality (Adamopoulou & Moussiades, 2020). Second, Generative AI’s reliance on extensive and complex data sources raises substantial intellectual property and legal concerns. For example, the data used in training models like ChatGPT may contain copyrighted material, risking infringement claims (Chan, 2023). Additionally, the ownership and attribution of AI-generated content remain contentious, often leading to disputes (Franceschelli & Musolesi, 2022). Lastly, the automation and intelligence features of Generative AI risk reducing personal interaction in education, possibly affecting the quality of emotional and human support provided by teachers (Gonzalez et al., 2023).

Based on research of the challenges and issues generated by the application of Generative AI in education, we identified several future trends in this area. There will be a shift in focus from educational ethics and academic integrity awareness to the establishment of technological ethics and legal standards, thus strengthening the supervision and management of Generative AI applications (Taylor, 2006; Thurzo et al., 2023). Attention will shift from considering Generative AI solely as an instructional tool to striking a balance between personalized learning and fostering student autonomy, avoiding excessive reliance on AI technology for intervention in student learning (J. T. H. Wang, 2023; T. Wang et al., 2023). Moreover, there will be a shift from focusing on changes in teacher-student relationships to enhancing research and optimization of human-computer interaction, ensuring that Generative AI in education can better communicate and interact with students and teachers (Shoufan, 2023; Skrabut, 2023).

# Discussion

This study conducted a systematic review of research on the application of Generative AI in the field of education using visualization and scientometric methods.By utilizing CiteSpace and VOSviewer to analyse 303 articles on the Web of Science, we identified trends in publication, prolific countries, institutions, and authors, as well as collaboration patterns among institutions and authors. We also determined significant journals and cited literature, along with research hotspots. The findings of this study are based on the analysis results and previous research.

The research findings indicate the rapid growth in the number of annual research papers on Generative AI in education. This indicates growing interest in the application of artificial intelligence in education. Scholars and educators are increasingly recognizing the potential of Generative AI to transform teaching methods (Kohnke et al., 2023) and implement personalized learning and intelligent tutoring systems (Rahman & Watanobe, 2023). A substantial volume of published research papers indicates that Generative AI has become a prominent research focus in exploring innovative solutions to improve educational efficiency and effectiveness (Kasneci, Seßler, et al., 2023; Qadir, 2022; Susnjak, 2022; Thunstrom, 2022). In terms of journal analysis, we observed that six journals, including Cureus Journal of Medical Science, Annals of Biomedical Engineering, Journal of Chemical Education, Sustainability, Journal of Public Health and Education and Information Technologies, performed prominently in the research on Generative AI in education. These journals ranked within the top ten in terms of both publication volume and citation count.

By analysing prolific countries, institutions, and authors as well as co-occurrence patterns, we gained insights into the major research forces and scientific collaboration relationships in the field of Generative AI in education. First, regarding prolific countries, the United States emerged as the most significant contributor to research on Generative AI in education, accounting for $2 5 \%$ of the total publication volume, far surpassing India and China, which were tied for second place with $7 \%$ each. Nine other prolific countries and regions also exhibited close collaboration ties with the United States. Second, concerning prolific institutions, four of the top ten institutions were from China, and three were from Australia. Interestingly, despite the United States having the highest publication volume, only one institution from the United States appeared in the top ten. This might be attributed to relatively limited collaboration between research institutions within the United States in the field of Generative AI in education. In contrast, research institutions from China and Australia seemed to be more inclined towards collaborative research in this domain. Third, among the most prolific authors, Haiyang Wu from China stood out as the most prolific. All ten of the most prolific authors had established their respective research teams.Notably, the application of Generative AI in education spans multiple disciplines and often requires the integration of various technologies and methods (Kasneci, Sessler, et al., 2023). Current research collaborations have indicated trends in national-, institutional-, and author-level cooperative networks. In the future, researchers from different disciplines should collaborate and integrate specialized knowledge and resources to achieve more comprehensive research and practice of Generative AI in education (Kohnke et al., 2023).

Through co-citation analysis, we found that the ten most cited articles in the research on Generative AI in education were all published in 2018 and onwards. Among them, six articles in particular were dedicated to the improvement and optimization of language models and training methods.The main objective of these studies was to enhance the quality and fluency of generated text through reinforcement of training and optimization algorithms for language models. As a result, more accurate and logically structured educational content could be generated. More specifically, the most highly cited paper focused on the performance of large pre-trained language models in few-shot learning tasks (Brown et al., 2020); the second most cited paper introduced the BERT model, enhanced fine-tuning methods, and demonstrated the importance of bidirectional pre-training for language representations. The third paper, Liu and colleagues, built on Devlin’s research, proposed RoBERTa, which could match or surpass the performance of all post-BERT methods (Devlin et al.,

2018; Liu et al., 2019);The fourth paper explored the importance of contextually enhanced word representations in natural language processing tasks (Peters et al., 2019); The fifth paper emphasized the effects of generative pre-training methods in enhancing language understanding (Radford et al., 2018); and one introduced a unified framework that transforms all text-based language tasks into a text-to-text format, exploring the prospects of natural language processing transfer learning techniques (Raffel et al., 2020).Within these six articles, there was a clear focus on optimizing language models and training methods, with the two most highly cited articles among them. This indicates the critical role that language models played in the development of Generative AI in education.In contrast, the remaining four papers primarily addressed the applications of Generative AI.One study focused on the nature, scope, and limitations of GPT-3 (Floridi & Chiriatti, 2020); one provided an overview of the history, technology, and applications of chatbots (Adamopoulou & Moussiades, 2020); one systematically reviewed the applications of artificial intelligence in higher education, with a focus on the role of educators (Zawacki-Richter et al., 2019); finally, one discussed the use of chatbots as learning companions, highlighting their role in connecting learning experiences, interests, and abilities (Fryer et al., 2019). It is noteworthy that among the top ten most prolific authors, none of their articles ranked in the top ten in terms of citation count. This suggests that in the research on Generative AI in the field of education, academic influence depended more on the content and quality of research rather than the contributions of individual authors.

Among all the keywords, ChatGPT, chatbot, large language model, machine learning, education, natural language processing and medical education are the most frequently used. This indicates a focus on technological innovations, educational applications, and specific areas like medical education (Adamopoulou & Moussiades, 2020; Brown et al., 2020). Furthermore, cluster analysis reveals three specific areas of focus in Generative AI research and practice in education. First, researchers are experimenting with Generative AI applications to enhance learning experiences and teaching effectiveness, leading to increased learning efficiency and improved learning outcomes (Rahman & Watanobe, 2023). Second, there is a strong emphasis on the development of intelligent educational technology based on Generative AI. Core technologies such as natural language processing, machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning are crucial for personalized learning support, efficient assessment, and the integration of AI with virtual reality (Dave et al., 2023; Megahed et al., 2023). The third aspect involves the challenges and ethical concerns related to the application of Generative AI in education. Ethical considerations necessitate scrutiny to ensure compliance and protection of academic and educational values, while academic institutions may need to develop strategies to prevent academic integrity issues. Over-reliance on Generative AI may shift the education landscape towards human-machine collaborative educational models in the future (Tlili et al., 2023).
