# Abstract

As novice members of their academic discourse communities, postgraduates face the challenge of learning to write in ways which will be judged as appropriate by those communities. Two resources in this effort are students own observations of the features of published texts in their disciplines, and feedback on their texts from teachers and advisors. These resources depend, though, on the extent to which textual features can be observed. Swales [Swales, J. M. (1996). Occluded genres in the academy: The case of the submission letter. In E. Ventola & A. Mauranen (Eds.). Academic writing: intercultural and textual issues (pp. 45–58). Amsterdam: John Benjamins.] has noted the existence of occluded academic genres. The notion of occlusion is extended here to refer to the features of academic texts which are not ordinarily visible to the reader. One important area of occlusion is citation and, specifically, the relationship between a reference to a source and the source itself. This article reports the findings of an investigation into three visible and occluded features of postgraduate second-language writing. The novice writers in this study were found to respond to their disciplines expectations in terms of the visible aspects of source use, but with regard to the occluded features their writing diverged considerably from received disciplinary norms. The findings also suggest that, with respect to disciplinary norms, a gap may exist between what is prescribed and what is practiced.

# 1. Introduction

Writing is a key academic activity, and a crucial one for postgraduates, for whom writing is simultaneously the most prominent learning activity and the normal mechanism by which they are assessed and awarded admission to their disciplinary discourse communities. Learning to write appropriate texts is, therefore, an essential component of academic success. What constitutes an appropriate text, however, is determined not only by general standards of good writing, but by the specific demands and constraints of the writers disciplinary community. Thus, learning to write entails becoming an individual sufficiently versed in the ways of the academic community to understand what makes a text appropriate. Or as Hyland puts it:

Learning to write academic genres. . . does, of course, involve students contending with issues of form and structure, and with public contexts for writing. To be successful, however, it must also involve them in acquiring a metacognitive awareness of these forms and contexts and a familiarity with the discoursal strategies they need to perform roles, engage in interactions, and accomplish goals in the target community. In sum, it requires that students gain an awareness of the disciplines symbolic resources for getting things done by routinely connecting purposes with features of texts (Hyland, 2000, p. 145).

How novice academic writers gain this awareness has been the subject of considerable discussion and investigation, and two suggestive themes have emerged from accounts of student–advisor relationships. First, parallels with apprenticeship have been drawn, and in particular with the mode of learning Lave and Wenger (1991) have termed legitimate peripheral participation (LPP) (by, e.g., Belcher, 1994; Becher & Trowler, 2001; Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995; Prior, 1998; Swales, 1998). LPP is characterized by novices involvement in the authentic tasks of a community of practice, while in close contact with an established member of that community, so that the skilled practitioner can observe and assess the novices performance, and the novice can observe and learn from the practitioners. While Lave and Wengers model of learning is, as Swales rightly notes, a rather idealized one (Swales, 1998, p. 203), the mutual engagement, active participation and observation which feature prominently in the model are likely to be beneficial. In Belchers (1994) study of three Ph.D. student–advisor pairs, the only relationship which could be described as an unqualified success was one which was characterized by a high degree of collaborative involvement between the student and the advisor in the activities of thesis research.

Other accounts of postgraduate–advisor interaction (e.g., Acker, Hill, & Black, 1994; Luebs, Fredrickson, Hyon, & Samraj, 1998; Prior, 1998) illustrate an aspect of the relationship which may easily be taken for granted: its ad hoc nature. While classroom-based learning is generally driven by a syllabus or set of learning objectives which more or less systematically address the areas the teacher believes to be important, a common mode of interaction between students and thesis advisors is for the student to present his or her recent efforts (reports on research, proposals, draft chapters, etc.) for the advisors feedback. In this pattern of interaction, it is the students work which triggers comments from the advisor and therefore to some extent sets the agenda for feedback. This, naturally enough, means that the advisor responds to those positive and negative features of the text which are seen to merit comment.

However, not all components of a text, nor all texts, are equally conspicuous. Swales (1996) has noted the existence of genres, such as job applications or letters accompanying an article submission, which ‘‘are typically hidden, -out of sight or -occluded from the public gaze’’ (p. 46). These genres are especially likely to be occluded for a novice researcher, who typically has fewer opportunities to perform the activities which render them visible (e.g., editing a scholarly journal, reviewing applications). At the same time, novices frequently need to produce such texts, often as part of genre chains (Swales, 2004, pp. 18–19). For example, publishing a research article (a public genre) involves producing ancillary texts such as a submission letter and responses to reviewers comments (occluded genres).

The realization that novice writers need to produce texts of a type they rarely see modeled has sparked a growing awareness that the occluded academic genres should be taught explicitly (Belcher, 2004, pp. 168–169; Swales, 1997, pp. 380–381), an effort which is facilitated by increasing attention to these genres in textbooks (Swales & Feak, 2000, 2004) and the research literature (e.g., Aguilar, 2004; Gosden, 2003; Hyon & Chen, 2004).

However, less attention has been given to the fact that within visible, public genres there exist features which are occluded (Pecorari, 2003). One example of occluded features can be found in citations. While citations themselves are quite visible, some aspects of what they signal are less so. For example, the reader of a new text cannot, merely by reading the citing text, ordinarily know whether an idea, fact, etc. attributed to the earlier text is reported accurately. The relationship between the two texts is, therefore occluded.

Because citation involves a reference—and often a minimal one—to something external to the citing text, it is especially susceptible to occlusion. Indeed, the acceptance of some occlusion is implicit in the existence of conventions for citation. The act of citing an earlier source creates a relationship between the citing and the cited texts. The writer cannot, however, assume a reader with a sufficiently detailed knowledge of all the cited texts to be able to diagnose the nature of that relationship. The conventional signals for source reporting are needed, therefore, to allow the writer to reveal as much of the relationship as she or he thinks the reader needs to know. At the same time the writer makes a tacit promise that the relationship is one which is appropriate in the discourse community. Quotation marks, for example, not only signal words repeated from a prior text, they promise the reader that the words are repeated accurately, that they have not been taken out of context, that they come from the work of the author who is named, and so on.

Whether this promise is kept depends on the writers skill (i.e., the ability to carry out the rhetorical task of reporting sources transparently), on the writers integrity, and on the writers expertise as a judge of what is acceptable within the discourse community. In the case of postgraduates, however, expertise cannot be taken for granted. By virtue of their status as students, it is accepted that their skills are in a developmental state (hence the need for advisors to evaluate and guide their work).

If that evaluation occurs on an ad hoc basis, though, there is reason to wonder whether the occluded features will receive the attention they deserve.1

The conjunction of occluded textual features and ad hoc advising raises a number of questions: as novice academic writers learn to write in their disciplinary discourse communities, do they perform as satisfactorily on occluded textual features as on visible ones? Is feedback from supervisors directed where it is needed, or primarily at the visible features of a text? And, most importantly, do novice writers gain sufficient skill in, and knowledge about, how they should perform academic writing in their disciplines, during their postgraduate apprenticeships? The investigation reported here addressed these questions through an analysis of the source use in the writing of 17 postgraduate students in four academic disciplines. The texts were found to be quite successful with regard to visible aspects of source use; however, the picture that emerged of the occluded features was rather different.

# 2. Methods

The texts that made up the research corpus were written by nine masters students and 8 Ph.D. students at three British universities, all of whom were non-native speakers of English (NNSEs). To balance the competing needs of providing as much context as possible for the writing samples and protecting the writers privacy, the two subcorpora were gathered in different ways. In the case of the masters subcorpus, lecturers were contacted to ask whether they and their students would be willing to take part in what was described in general terms as a study of academic writing. This resulted in nine students completing the study: two each in biology, civil engineering, and education, and three in linguistics. None of the students or the supervisors were known to me before I solicited their involvement in the project. The nine students and their supervisors agreed to take part in interviews, and to the use of their writing (in the case of the students) or their comments on the writing samples (in the case of the supervisors) in this project. So that the interviews could be conducted during the period of active writing, the masters students were asked to supply drafts of material which they anticipated would later be included in their dissertations.2 All complied, except for the two engineering students, who wrote no preliminary drafts prior to completing and submitting their dissertations. Although it cannot be known how representative this relatively small number of students can be said to be of postgraduate second-language writers, there is no reason to believe that they differed substantially from their peers in any respect which might influence these findings, apart from, perhaps, their willingness to participate in this study, which might tentatively be interpreted as speaking to a degree of commitment to and interest in writing well.

For the reasons detailed above, the masters writing samples were in draft form. In order to include some final-draft writing in the corpus, the Ph.D. subcorpus was composed of samples from completed Ph.D. theses taken from the shelves of the students university libraries. No contact was made with the students or their supervisors. Selections of approximately equal length were selected from the early chapters of eight theses, two each from the four disciplines represented in the masters subcorpus. In all, the corpus contained over 51,000 words with each writing sample averaging just over 3000. Table 1 gives details of the composition of the corpus. (To insure the anonymity of the writers, the names of the masters students have been changed and the names of the writers departments and universities are not given.)

The focus of this investigation was the visible and occluded use of sources and citation in the student writing samples. Three aspects of source use proved to be relevant to the question of occlusion: (1) secondary citation; (2) the nature of the sources used and reported; and (3) language repeated from the source. Investigating these three areas involved first establishing what the expectations of the writers disciplinary discourse communities were likely to be; then examining the visible portions of the texts; and, finally, examining the occluded aspects.

# 2.1. Establishing disciplinary expectations

A range of sources was used to shed light on what ‘‘appropriate’’ means in the contexts of the disciplines considered here. A large body of the literature has addressed writing within academic disciplines (e.g., Becher & Trowler, 2001; Charles,

2003; Hyland, 2000; Shaw, 1992, 2003; Swales, 1990, 1998, among many others). Interviews with the writers and their supervisors, the observation of similarities and differences within and across disciplines in the corpus itself, and widely accepted principles of source use also informed the question of appropriateness.

Secondary citation refers to a report of a source based not on the source itself, but upon an account of it from another, later text. The MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Writing expresses a preference for avoiding this form of citation: ‘‘Whenever you can, take material from the original source, not a secondhand one’’ (Gibaldi, 1998, p. 245). The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association concurs that ‘‘it is preferable to read and cite primary sources whenever possible’’ (American Psychological Association, 2001, p. 245). Both manuals agree that when sources are used at second hand, the citation should make that clear, and on that point there is likely to be widespread agreement.

The types of sources cited in an academic text are necessarily constrained by the topic and therefore by the discipline in which the text is produced. Bechers useful identification of ‘‘urban’’ and ‘‘rural’’ fields helps explain the preference of certain disciplines for certain types of sources. Urban fields resemble big-city life in that they are characterized by ‘‘a densely concentrated population[,] a generally busy—occasionally frenetic—pace of life, a high level of collective activity, close competition for space and resources, and a rapid and heavily used information network’’ while the opposite is generally true of a rural field (Becher & Trowler, 2001, p. 106). Urban fields tend to be in the sciences,3 while the soft disciplines and the hard, applied ones, are often rural in nature (Becher & Trowler, 2001, p. 108). The areas represented in the present study bear this out; the scientists alone could be said to participate in an urban research environment.

Rural fields tend to favor book publications, while in urban fields the journal article dominates (Becher & Trowler, 2001, p. 110). Citing discussion by Whitley (1984) and by Griffith and Small (1983), Becher and Trowler (2001) discuss this preference largely in terms of the extent to which topics require explanation and elaboration. Where detailed accounts of complex procedures and close reasoning are needed, a journal article may not offer sufficient space to address the topic.

Clearly the nature of a research project determines the amount of space needed to describe it, as illustrated by the fact that articles in technical fields are frequently under ten pages in length, while in the social sciences they can easily be more than double that. However, speed is likely also to be a consideration, since the fast pace of urban fields puts a premium on rapid publication. Journal publication lends itself to speed, and some journals are especially responsive to the need to disseminate findings quickly. For example, the Lancet is published weekly, and offers an accelerated refereeing process which can result in an article appearing in print within four weeks of it being submitted. The prestigious Science4 publishes some papers electronically before they appear in a paper edition. This differential need for rapid publication is confirmed by the broad range in time from submission to publication, which can be as little as three months or as long as three years, depending on the field (Becher & Trowler, 2001, p. 112). So while there is likely to be considerable overlap among the disciplines with regard to type of source cited, the (urban) scientists would be expected to show a preference for journal articles, especially newer ones, and the other (rural) fields to cite a wider range of sources, including books and older sources.

With regard to language repeated from sources, disciplinary differences are more clear cut. Quotation—the repetition of language from a source, made evident by the use of quotation marks or another typographical device—comprises a significant minority of citations in the soft disciplines, but is vanishingly rare in hard fields.5 One of the biology supervisors confirmed this, commenting ‘‘. . .it just wouldnt happen in a masters or Ph.D. thesis, you just wouldnt expect to see it, and I dont think I ever have.’’ This difference may be dictated by the epistemological demands of hard and soft fields. If a knowledge claim is based on objective fact, any accurate rendering of that fact is as good as any other. Where subjective claims are at stake (as they often are in soft fields) especially great care may be needed to give a nuanced rendering, making claims neither stronger nor weaker than the original author intended. Explicit quotation can be one strategy for accomplishing this.

Regardless of discipline, language repeated from a source should appear within quotation marks, or in narrower margins (in the case of longer quotations), or should otherwise be marked as coming from another source. The principle that quotation, when it used, must be signaled, is thought to be widely accepted across disciplines, and the fact that university disciplinary policies uniformly categorize unsignaled repetition as plagiarism (Pecorari, 2001) suggests that no need is perceived to specify exceptions for particular disciplines.

It is noteworthy that arriving at the above description of ‘‘best practice’’ in source use entails drawing on sources as disparate as prescriptive writing guides, descriptive accounts of academic texts, and reports from individual informants. This highlights the fact that expectations for writing within the disciplines have been codified unevenly, leaving many lacunae. For example, the MLA and APA guides offer finegrained descriptions of scholarly writing practices, and are widely accepted as authoritative within the humanities and social sciences, respectively. However, writers in the sciences and engineering lack a similarly detailed guide.

The scarcity of comprehensive standards has two practical implications for the present research. First, it enhances the role of existing texts as models. Second, there is likely to be some disagreement—perhaps considerable disagreement—about general principles and how to apply them in practice. From the point of view of the novice attempting to enter the discourse community this is unfortunate, as the likely concern of such a writer will be not only to produce texts which are acceptable to influential individual readers such as advisors and examiners, but also to the disciplinary discourse community generally.

# 2.2. Examining the visible features

Because of the highly conventional nature of citation in academic writing, identifying the visible manifestations of source use in the student writing samples was straightforward. Secondary citation was identified where it was signaled by means of the conventional ‘‘Smith, as cited in Jones,’’ or by a similar device. For example, although Roulas citation in (1), is not in precisely the form advocated by writing manuals, the mention of Hegel immediately followed by a citation to Cooper spells out clearly that Hegel was not a primary source.

(1) Hegel regarded a dead metaphor as -one that has lost its power to call up ideas which the words once expressed (Cooper, 1986, p. 24). [Roula 6:1e]

The type of publication cited, and the year in which it was published, were also evident in most cases from the citation and reference list (although 44, or nearly $10 \%$ , of the sources cited could not reliably be classified according to type, most often because entries in the reference list were missing or incomplete, particularly among the (draft) dissertation writing samples). Similarly, quotation could be identified by the presence of quotation marks, the use of narrower margins for longer quotations or, rarely, some other explicit textual device.

# 2.3. Examining the occluded features

By contrast, the very nature of occluded features meant that identifying them was more complex and involved a certain amount of inference. Investigating the occluded citation features entailed examining not only the 17 writing samples but the sources they cited. Altogether the student texts used and/or referred to 481 sources. Of these, 363, or three-quarters, were obtained. Portions of the student-written texts, accounting for nearly 31,000 words, or $60 \%$ of the corpus, were then compared to the sources to establish the relationship between each source and the writers representation of it. Some parts of the student texts could not be compared, for one of a number of reasons, including the absence of a citation, presumably indicating that the passage in question was original to the writer, or the unavailability of the cited source.

In order to assess whether occlusion was involved in the first two areas—secondary citation and the nature of the source used—it was necessary to determine whether the source cited was the one actually used at a given point in the student text. This was done primarily on the basis of a degree of similarity between a portion of the student writing sample and another text which indicated that the latter was likely to be the source for the former, as in example (2).

Example (2a) comes from a student writing sample, (b) comes from Berg (1987), a source cited elsewhere by the student but not in this section of the text, and (c) comes from Deese (1984), the source cited by the student (here and elsewhere, the origin of examples is given in square brackets and italics, underlining indicates language in common between the student text and its source, and bold type indicates language in common between two sources).

(2a) Deese 1984 does not find a single example of a genuine spoonerism in his taperecorded English corpus and thinks that exchange is rarer than commonly supposed (p. 17). [H1 26:2g]   
(2b) In his tape-recorded English corpus, Deese 1984 does not find a single example of a genuine spoonerism and concludes that this error category is -much rarer than we commonly suppose (Deese, 1984, p. 118). [(Berg, 1987, pp. 28–29)]   
(2c) Notice that there are, with one possible exception, no completed spoonerisms. Neighboring speech sounds (with, as Lashley and others have observed, anticipation being the norm) are often the source of mispronounced words, but I suspect that the complete reversals for spoonerisms are much rarer than we commonly suppose. [Deese, 1984, p. 118]

The strong similarity between (2a) and (2b) forms the basis for the conclusion that H1 has cited Deese at second hand, through Berg. The H1 passage can be subdivided into three strings, (1) Deese (1984) does not find a single example of a genuine spoonerism; (2) in his tape-recorded English corpus; and (3) thinks that exchange is rarer than commonly supposed (p. 17). The first two strings appear in identical form in Berg, although reversed. The third string is not identical but shows great similarity to Berg, as Table 2 illustrates.

The third string differs from Berg in six respects: (1) the choice of reporting verb; (2) ‘‘exchange’’ in place of ‘‘this error category’’ (exchange was the error category intended by Berg); (3) Berg retains much in the quotation from Deese, while H1 omits it; (4) Berg retains ‘‘we suppose’’ from Deese, while the student gives it in the passive; (5) Berg signals six words as quotation, while H1 does not, perhaps because of the last two changes; and (6) in the final citation, Berg repeats ‘‘Deese $1 9 8 4 '$ as well as the page number, while H1 gives only the page number (note the discrepancy; Bergs reference is correct). In spite of these differences, the underlying similarity of structure suggests that H1s string can be viewed as a modified version of Bergs.

Table 2 Partial comparison of H1 and Berg (note that Bergs ‘‘commonly’’ appears out of order for ease of comparison)   

<html><body><table><tr><td>H1 Berg</td><td>and thinks</td><td></td><td>category</td><td>that exchange is</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>rarer than commonly supposed</td><td>and concludes that this error is much rarer than commonly we suppose&#x27; (Deese 1984,</td><td>(p. 17) p. 118)</td></tr></table></body></html>

This interpretation is supported by the fact that the similarity between H1 and Berg is greater than the similarity of either passage to Deese. Apart from the string in Table 2, only the word ‘‘spoonerism’’ occurs in all three passages. The differences between $( 2 \mathrm { a } / \mathrm { b } )$ and (2c) fall into two categories. First, Berg and H1 are more concise than Deese: the qualification ‘‘with one possible exception’’ is omitted, as is the discussion of interactions with ‘‘neighboring speech sounds.’’ These two omissions are hardly conclusive, since both involve propositions ancillary to Deeses main point; they are, therefore, precisely the sort of detail that would tend to be left out of a reference to this point in Deeses book. More significant is the reference in (2a) and (2b) to the absence of genuine spoonerisms; Deese has completed spoonerisms, contrasting them with ‘‘aborted’’ spoonerisms (Deese, 1984, pp. 118–119), in which speakers begin exchange errors and then interrupt and correct themselves. ‘‘Genuine’’ is not an obvious paraphrasing choice; its presence in both H1 and Berg is yet another similarity which, taken with those described above, suggests that the H1 and Berg wordings indicate unacknowledged secondary citation.

Two caveats should be noted, though. First, however likely it is that Berg was the source of H1s account of Deese—and I have argued that it is likely indeed—it remains an inference. The theoretical possibility can never be entirely eliminated that the similarity is a result of coincidence, regardless of the degree of similarity between two texts.6 Second, the conclusion that H1 reported Deeses work through Bergs account of it does not preclude the possibility that H1 also read Deese. That would not, however, mitigate the potential consequences of adding an additional link to the chain of reporting. Those consequences will be illustrated below.

Establishing occluded—i.e., unsignaled—repetition of language involved comparing passages from the student texts with their sources. The conventions used for identifying shared words included the following: words were counted if they were spelled differently as a result of typographical error or different spelling conventions, or if they were inflected differently for tense or number, but not if they appeared in two texts as different word classes. Thus (invented examples), (3a) and (3b) are considered to share dramatic, change(s), have/has, been and reali(z/s)ed, but not recent/recently.

(3a) In recent years, dramatic changes have been realized.   
(3b) Recently, a dramatic change has been realised.

Important to note is that this comparison did not count all the words shared by entire texts, but only those in contextually related sections. So, for example, spoonerism in (2a), is counted as being present in both texts, not only because the word occurs in both but because it occurs in the repeated phrase ‘‘does not find a single example of a genuine spoonerism,’’ and because (2a) and (2b) address the same topic in a similar way. Finally, all sources used for comparison were included in reference lists or otherwise identified by the writers, although not always in proximity to the part of the text under comparison. It is possible that entirely uncited texts may have been used in some or all of the writing samples.

# 3. Visible and occluded source use in the writing samples

The preceding section described conventional and expected features of source use in four disciplines. The extent to which the texts in this corpus match the above description can be taken as an indication of the writers success both in understanding what their disciplines expect of them, and in meeting those expectations. With respect to the visible features, the writers performance was very much in line with expectations; the use of acknowledged secondary citation, the nature of the sources cited, and the signaling of quotation, fell within the bounds described. However, when the occluded elements were examined, a different picture emerged.

# 3.1. Secondary citation

Secondary citation, as noted above, is generally less desirable than a reference to the primary source, and should be signaled clearly when used. An examination of the citations in this corpus indicate limited use of secondary citation. Altogether 858 instances of a source being mentioned occur in the corpus. (To arrive at this figure, repeated mentions of the same source were counted separately, as were multiple works referred to in a single citation.) As Fig. 1 shows, only 17 of the 858 source mentions involve acknowledged secondary citation, with no such citations occurring in biology, one in engineering and eight in each of the other two fields. In no field is this feature as common as once per 1000 words. One of the few examples of acknowledged secondary citation is shown in (4).

(4) Despite the commitment and involvement of those who held pastoral roles, -. . (teachers) were largely ineffective because their efforts were unbacked by a structured programme of skills-based guidance for success. They saw themselves as solely concerned with the provision of emotional first aid. . . (Hamblin, 1981, cited in Megahy, 1998, p. 28). [Graciela 3:4b]

However, the comparison of the student texts with their sources shows that this superficial appearance of compliance with common practice is misleading. A much larger number of citations appear to have been included through a secondary source, without acknowledgement, as in example (5). Although the student text in (5a) refers only to Bjerrum at this point, a source acknowledged elsewhere in the writing sample reports the same point from Bjerrum, in similar language, suggesting that student based this account of Bjerrum on Brenner et al.s.

![](img/b0385789ed5337d6f40b581822404f6f884ee710b1c6950544ce9b11e3c92bf9.jpg)  
Fig. 1. Frequency of secondary citation.

(5a) The effect of the weathering process on both the shear strength and compressibility of clay has been explained by Bjerrum (1967) in the manner illustrated in Figure (2.9). [Eng2 28:2]   
(5b) The effect of weathering on strength and compressibility has been explained by Bjerrum (1967) in the manner illustrated in Fig. 2.37. [Brenner, Nutalaya, Chilingarian, and Robertson, 1981, p. 205] Similarly, in (6a), the student refers to Fischer et al. (1982) and Lombardi et al.   
(1985).

(6a) Mannan which is a major constituent of the cell wall in $C .$ albicans, inhibits a Candida antigen-induced in vitro proliferation of normal lymphocytes and also blocks the antigen-presenting ability of macrophages (Fischer et al., 1982).//In addition, the polysaccharide fractions from $C .$ albicans stimulate T-cells to produce a suppressor factor, which inhibits interleukin 1 and interleukin 2 production (Lombardi et al., 1985). [Sci2 26:1c]

(6b) Manna, a major constituent of the cell wall in $C .$ albicans, was detected in the serum of some patients with mucocutaneous candidiasis (Fischer et al., 1978). Mannan inhibited a Candida antigen-induced in vitro proliferation of normal lymphocytes and also blocked the antigen-presenting ability of macrophages (Fischer et al., 1982).//In another study, polysaccharide fractions (containing mostly mannose and glucose residues) from $C .$ . albicans stimulated the T-cells to produce a suppressor factor, which in turn inhibited interleukin 1 and interleukin 2 production (Lombardi et al., 1985). [(Datta, Ganesan, & Natarajan, 1989, p. 70)]

Datta et al. (1989) refer to the same two sources, and in virtually identical wording, leading to the nearly inescapable conclusion that this report of the two sources was based on Datta et al.s secondary account of them, although the citation does not reflect that. A further misleading impression is that it was the student who identified relevant research articles and was able not only to describe their findings, but to relate them to each other and show how each contributes to informing a wider topic. In (6b) we see that that effort was not the students but Datta et al.s.

This is a substantive point, not merely a formal one, as (7a) and (7b) demonstrate. (Here and elsewhere, all typographical and grammatical errors were present in the original, although, to avoid breaking up the example, the conventional ‘‘sic’’ is not used.)

(7a) A major opponent of Shattuck-Hufnagel and Klatts conclusion is found in Goldstein (1980) and van den Broecke and Goldstein (1980). Glostein has found evidence for feature processing in 16-consonant confusion matrices involving speech errors, listening errors for CV and VC syllables in a noisy environment. Van den Broecke and Goldstein conclude that these robust categorical features play a role in the representation of consonants during both speech production and perception. This analysis is supplemented by data from German and Dutch, as is admitted by Shattuck-Hufnagel and Klatt (1979, p. 53), represents the best currently available evidence for the processing of features during speech (van den Broeke and Goldstein also investigated German and Dutch data, in Fromkin, 1980). [H1 33:2]

(7b) A formal way to ask this question has recently been described by Goldstein (Note 1). He has found evidence for three features (voicing, continuant, and aspects of place of articulation) in 16-consonant confusion matrices involving (1) speech errors, (2) listening errors for CV syllables in noise, and (3) listening errors for VC syllables in noise. He concludes that these robust ‘‘categorical’’ features play a role in the representation of consonants during both speech production and perception. This analysis probably represents the best currently available evidence for the processing of features during speech production and perception, but it is by no means conclusive. [Shattuck-Hufnagel and Klatt, 1979, p. 53]

In (7a), the writer presents two opposing points of view, one held by co-authors Shattuck-Hufnagel and Klatt and the other held by Goldstein, who is cited alone and together with a co-author, van den Broecke. The passage begins with the writers assertion that the two views are in opposition and then outlines Goldsteins evidence, the conclusions reached by van den Broecke and Goldstein on the basis of that evidence, and finally reports Shattuck-Hufnagel and Klatts concession that that evidence has value. However, on examining Shattuck-Hufnagel and Klatt, it becomes evident that this account of work done by their ‘‘major opponent’’ was written by them. It was not the (presumably neutral) writer who had assessed the relative merits of these two bodies of work, and the reliability of the assessment is called into question by the knowledge that it was drafted by a partisan in the conflict.

Fig. 2. Secondary citation per 1000 words of text.

This, presumably, is one of the reasons for the widely accepted principle that secondary citation should be acknowledged: so that the reader can judge whose interpretation is being put forward. Another reason may be simple accuracy, since the more links in the transmission of a message, the more inaccuracies can creep in. Nonetheless, unacknowledged secondary citation was prominent in this corpus, amounting to 137 source mentions, eight times the number that were acknowledged, so that $1 8 \%$ of all source mentions are at second hand (see Fig. 1). The reality conflicts, therefore, with the superficial appearance that secondary citation is a marginal feature. As Fig. 2 shows, the presence of this feature averages just over 2 occurrences per 1000 words in the corpus, and rises to over 4 per 1000 words in the science and humanities sub-corpora. It is interesting to note that the scientists, the group which acknowledged no secondary citation, nearly tie with the humanities writers as the heaviest users of it.

The 17 texts in this corpus thus presented the appearance of being in compliance with conventions governing secondary references to sources. However, when this occluded aspect of source use was examined more closely, the appearance of conformity was not maintained.

# 3.2. Details of the sources

Given the preference of urban scholars to publish quickly and in journals, the expectation was that the biologists would cite more journal articles, and more recent ones, than the other writers. This expectation was met: the average age of the sources cited by the scientists was 9 years, but more than double that, ranging from 19 to 22 years, for the other fields (see Fig. 3). Research articles made up $8 5 \%$ of the sources cited by the biologists, but not more that $24 \%$ of those in the other fields (see Fig. 4).

Fig. 4. Research articles as a proportion of all sources cited and used.

The biologists give the impression, therefore, of being sensitive to the need to contextualize their work in the most recent research literature.

However, because of the presence of secondary citation, the group of sources cited in the writing samples was not precisely the same as the group of sources which were determined actually to have been used. As Fig. 3 shows, when the sources actually used are considered, the picture changes somewhat. The proportion of RAs among the scientists sources is slightly lower— $80 \%$ . The sources used are also somewhat younger for all groups since, clearly, secondary sources have later publication dates than the primary sources they report. In (8a), for example, Ingrid cites a 1994 study by Kennard et al., but the similarity with Ferreira et al.s slightly later paper (8b) suggests that Ingrid based her account on the latter.

(8a) In B. oleracea, two marker loci associated with flowering time showed significant additive $\veebar$ additive and additive $\times$ dominant epistasis in a cross of cabbage and broccoli (Kennard et al.). [Ingrid 4:1]   
(8b) Likewise, in B. oleracea, two marker loci associated with flowering time showed significant additive $\times$ additive and additive $\times$ dominant epistasis in a cross of cabbage and broccoli (Kennard et al., 1994). [Ferreira, Stagopan, Yandell, Williams, and Osborn, 1995, p. 731]

The relevance of giving a misleading impression about the age of sources depends on the discipline involved. For the urban biologists, citing and using recently published sources is positive. However, the fact that the sources used by the scientists were more recent on average than those cited does not indicate that they were also more up-to-date, as (9) illustrates. The sources cited in (9a) are research articles, but as in example (5), the source appears to have been Datta et al. (1989), which is not a research article but a review article of ‘‘Current trends in Candida Albicans research.’’ Thus, while the source used for this passage is in fact newer than those which were cited, it is simply a retelling of older findings and not a report of newer ones.

(9a) True hyphal cells have perforated septa and the cell junctions are not constricted. Chlamydospores are thick walled asexual spores formed by the rounding up of pre-existing cells (Odds et al., 1985; Torosantucci and Cassone, 1983). [Sci2 18:2bii]   
(9b) True hyphal cells are longer than blastoconidia and have perforated septa; cell junctions are not constricted. Chlamydospores are thick-walled asexual spores formed by the rounding up of pre-existing cells (Torosantucci and Cassone, 1983; Odds, 1985). [Datta et al., 1989, pp. 58–59]

By contrast, some research topics benefit from a historical grounding, and reference to some older sources speaks to the writer having taken an appropriately broad time perspective. Such an impression given by Kwans discussion of educational evaluation in (10a), in which she appears to trace the changing understanding of evaluation, citing Tyler as an example of the early 20th century view, Cronbach for the 1960s and Popham on a change that had come about by the 1970s. From (10b) it is clear that the historical progression has been outlined by Popham. Kwans role has been to condense Pophams overview (the ellipses in the quotation from Popham represent significant amounts of omitted text), rather than to synthesize the original sources.

(10a) For centuries evaluation has been used by classroom teachers as an equivalent of -testing. Later on in early 1900s evaluation was accorded by some researchers a different function, i.e., -appraisal of an educational programmes quality. (Tyler, for example.) Then in 1960s Cronbach argued in one of his articles entitled -Course Improvement Through Evaluation for the necessity of focussing educational evaluation on the development process of a programme (1963). In the early 1970s, evaluation was seen as a facilitator for decisionmaking in educational programmes. As Popham puts it -In the early 1970s, however, there was a pervasive belief that well-conducted educational evaluations could, and should, constitute the single most important factor in the rendering of educational decisions. (1988:5). [Kwan 2:3]

(10b) For centuries the term evaluation has been used by classroom teachers. . . For most educators, indeed, the idea of evaluation was essentially equivalent to the idea of testing. . . In 1932 Ralph W. Tyler. . . came to view evaluation not as the appraisal of students, but rather as the appraisal of an educational programs quality. . . In a 1963 article entitled ‘‘Course Improvement through Evaluation,’’. . . Cronbach argued that if educational evaluation were to be of assistance to curriculum developers, it had to be focused on the decisions faced by curriculum specialists during the process of their development efforts. . . In the early 1970s, however, there was a pervasive belief that wellconducted educational evaluations could, and should, constitute the single most important factor in the rendering of educational decisions. [Popham, 1988, pp. 1–2]

Thus, with regard to the types of sources cited and used, the writers again can be seen to have conformed superficially to disciplinary expectations. The urban biologists cited much more recent findings, and a high proportion of research articles, compared with the writers in the other three fields. These tendencies were, however, less marked in the actual source use.

# 3.3. Imported language

It was expected that the science and engineering writers would avoid explicit quotation, and that those in the humanities and social sciences would use it as a minority strategy, and this proved to be the case. Among the eight science and engineering texts, only one, a masters dissertation in engineering, includes explicit quotation. On the other hand, the humanities and social science texts contain 181 quotations (see Fig. 5).

(11) However, despite the research and studies on this subject, -both the nature and scope of personal and social education remain controversial. (Galloway, 1990, p. 1). [Graciela 2:2]   
(12) Indeed, Trumper and Rizzi (1985) maintain that since the origins of this phenomenon affect not only Greek, it is more plausible to talk about a ‘‘Sprachbund balcanico-calabrese meridionale-salentina’’ (p. 70). [H2 42:1a]

Fig. 5. Frequency of signaled quotation.

Quotation is, however, a visible feature only as long as it is signaled. Ordinarily, a reader assumes that language not signaled as quotation has been composed by the writer, not repeated from another source. However, in this corpus that assumption is not reliable. Numerous passages contain language repeated (nearly) verbatim from a source, without quotation marks, and often without mention of the source. Examples of this appear in (13), (14) and (15).

(13a) Sensitivity, S, is usually defined as the ratio between the undisturbed shear strength to the remoulded shear strength, as determined either from vane test or from unconfined compression test. [Eng2 23:5]   
(13b) Sensitivity, $\underline { { S } } _ { \mathrm { t } } .$ is usually defined as the ratio of the undisturbed shear strength to the remoulded shear strength, determined either from vane tests or from unconfined compression tests. [Brenner et al., 1981, pp. 214–215]   
(14a) This view is not shared by those who distinguish that the practices appropriate in the pastoral sphere may not always be appropriate in the academic sphere (and vice versa), and even that separate organisational arrangements may be necessary (Best, Ribbins, Jarvis, & Oddy, 1983, p. 276). [Graciela 3:2]   
(14b) . . . there are grounds for arguing that the practices appropriate in the pastoral sphere may not always be appropriate in the academic sphere (and vice versa), and even that separate organizational arrangements may be necessary. [Best et al., 1983, p. 276]

Fig. 6. Unattributed quotation as a proportion of compared writing samples.

Repetition of this sort is surprisingly common in the corpus. Considered as a proportion of the parts of the writing samples which were compared to their sources, and excluding language signaled as quotation, $41 \%$ of the corpus consists of language repeated without attribution from sources. Interestingly, as Fig. 6 shows, the writers who relied most on unsignaled repetition from their sources were the biologists—the group which made no use at all of signaled quotation.

In three respects, then—the use of secondary citation, the nature of the sources reported and the use of explicit quotation—the texts give the appearance of conforming closely to expectations. Standards for secondary citation are likely to be broadly shared across academic areas, while disciplines differ in the types of sources used, and the acceptability of quoting language from a source. With regard to the type and age of the source referred to, the profile presented by the science writers sharply differs from the other three groups, and Bechers urban and rural distinction offers an explanation for the difference. The presence or absence of signaled quotation is accounted for by the familiar distinction between hard and soft subject areas. In all three areas, the visible aspects of source use approximate disciplinary expectations more closely than the occluded aspects, which in some cases violate common standards.

# 4. Explaining the divergence

Why did the writers in this study use sources in ways which so sharply diverged from the predictable expectations of their discourse communities? Were the misleading aspects of source use intentional? This last is an important question since inappropriate source use may be interpreted as plagiarism. While space does not permit a full discussion of the role of intention in plagiarism, it should be noted that a current trend in composition theory is concerned with providing alternative explanations for dependence on the language of sources. Howard (1995, 1999) has coined the term patchwriting to describe the dependence of novice writers on the language of their sources, and argues that this is a common developmental stage. Anecdotal accounts of writers who use the language of their sources without adequate attribution, but who seem to be motivated by something other than a straightforward intention to cheat, can be found in Crocker and Shaw (2002), Currie (1998), Hull and Rose (1989), Matalene (1985), and Petric´ (2004), among others, and empirical evidence is provided by Pecorari (2003). Barks and Watts (2001) argue for the need to raise students awareness of the complexities of issues in source use, complexities which electronic media augment (Belcher, 2001; Bloch, 2001).

A number of alternatives are therefore available to the view that apparent plagiarism stems from an intentionally deceptive act. A further explanation that can be added to these is the role that visibility and occlusion play in students efforts to enter their discourse communities. Visibility is a key element in Lave and Wengers (1991) articulation of legitimate peripheral participation. In the successful apprenticeship they describe for tailors in West Africa, novices performed small tasks which exposed the relationship between pieces of a garment and the whole. By contrast, apprentice butchers in a supermarket were blocked from learning, in part by the physical layout of the workplace, which prevented them from seeing what the skilled workers did: the working practices they were to learn were quite literally invisible to them. Visibility is achieved when novices can observe the work processes, and not merely their products.

Theses and dissertations are often produced and assessed with emphasis on the product. It is reasonable to think that students model their own efforts at least in part on the scholarly publications they read; they can, however, observe only the visible features of the finished product. Students reading a published research article can only guess whether the writer always consulted primary sources, cited sources accurately and signaled all quotations; a similar blind spot affects supervisors reading student texts. The processes and features that are not visible cannot be observed, but only inferred.

In interviews, the student writers whose texts were investigated here emphasized the tentative nature of their inferences. Ingrid, a biologist, explained that she was uncertain to some extent about her writing but tried to observe what other writers did: ‘‘I think everyones doing it in more or less the same way.’’ Having made their best efforts, the students relied upon their advisors to judge their success. As Roula said:

thats why I think the tutor has to. . . be a part of the whole thing, to read the paraphrases and quotations and tell you if youre doing the right place, or if you have to rewrite it, or if you dont have to just mention it at all.

Ingrid, whose work leant heavily on its sources, agreed: ‘‘I just do what I think I supposed to and they never actually make that much comments about it.’’ (Here and elsewhere, quotations from the interviews are verbatim, with nonstandard lexical and grammatical usage maintained.)

The writers applied a straightforward principle: they inferred rules, attempted to put them into practice, and waited for feedback. When the feedback did not include comments on source use, the students assumed that theirs was appropriate, along with the inferences that guided it. For similar reasons the supervisors were unaware of the problems with source use. Early in our interviews, I asked the supervisors to comment generally on the strengths and weaknesses of the texts, and their responses indicated that although the dissertation samples were drafts, and therefore offered scope for improvement, they were broadly acceptable. The comments of Dr. Frost, Ingrids supervisor, are revealing. He noted that she had come to the study of plants through a background in animal biology and that much of the relevant literature was new to her. However, he concluded, ‘‘Shes made a reasonable job of trying to understand what people are doing and why theyre trying to do it.’’ Dr. Frost criticized Ingrids work for referencing a relatively small proportion of the available literature on the topic but said ‘‘clearly shes found a lot of key ones,’’ adding that the program wanted students to give their topics ‘‘broad coverage, and yes, she has.’’ However, when we looked together at Ingrids text and its sources, this assessment changed sharply. Dr. Frost was clear in categorizing Ingrids strategies as inappropriate: ‘‘That is not what theyre expected to do, and if Id spotted it I would have been very concerned about it, yes’’ [emphasis added].

The occluded aspects of academic writing were, therefore, in a blind spot for the students and supervisors both. Certainly the students could have asked their supervisors to comment on their performance, but doing so would have presupposed an awareness of what issues need comment. From the supervisors side, investigating the occluded features of every student text would have been impossible in practical terms. Dr. Frost noted this reality:

It worries me that she has taken a large chunk very much verbatim from published work and it doesnt surprise me that were not spotting it with so many coming through all we do, youve got half an hour for each project report, theres no way most people would have the time to go back and check to what extent this sort of straight copying has occurred. Im not happy about it.

More importantly though, investigating the occluded features would reflect suspicion of the text. Precisely because the relationship between a source and a report of it is occluded, it is widely accepted that source reports should be transparent; that is, they should use the conventional signals to create an accurate portrait of the relationship (Groom, 2000; Tadros, 1993). The absence of transparency is more often treated as a question of academic ethics than of skills. An advisor would ordinarily investigate the occluded features of a students text only if he or she suspected deliberate, transgressive behavior. That, thankfully, is not part of the typical advisor-student relationship. Thus, worryingly, these students and supervisors approached their tasks with strategies which left the occluded source features not only uninvestigated but also unsuspected.

Non-normative source use was not detected because it was occluded. How did it arise in the first place? Of a number of factors which may have contributed to the situation, two are closely related to the question of occlusion. First, the fact that source relationships are occluded to the reader of a text affected both the supervisors, as readers of their students work, and the students, as readers of the scholarly literature. The students prime opportunities to learn—observations of texts in their fields, and feedback—only educated them about visible textual features.

Second, occluded textual features may mask a gap between what the academic community says it expects, and what is actually done. A case in point is the reporting of secondary sources. In a survey of university plagiarism policies (Pecorari, 2001) unacknowledged secondary citation was actually identified as a form of plagiarism, evidence that secondary citation is addressed—at least at some institutions—at a university-wide level, and not considered to need a discipline-specific approach. Yet the instance of unattributed secondary citation in (16) was defended by the student and supervisor involved as entirely appropriate.

(16) The medium developed by Murashige and Skoog (1962) (see Appendix: Student sources) for tobacco tissue culture is being used extensively in micro propagation of Mentha, as well as other plants. [Erden 3:1a]

Because this paper was conspicuous by being much older than the others Erden cited, I asked him and his supervisor to comment on it. Erden explained that the medium described in the paper is one which ‘‘everybody’’ uses. His supervisor concurred that the paper was widely used and cited, but not widely read:

A journal would insist on. . . that reference, Murashige and Skoog must be among the most widely cited papers ever and virtually nobody will have read it but everybody has to cite it.

The apparent paradox lies in the fact that the Murashige and Skoog medium, which is sold commercially, already prepared, is widely enough used not to need explanation or justification. The authors who first described it are cited primarily to give credit for their innovation. Understanding this as a legitimate exception to general rules about citing secondary sources requires an understanding of the specific disciplinary context.

Other exceptions have been documented. Devitt (1991), in her study of the genres of tax accounting, describes a common practice which she terms ‘‘unmarked quotation, what teachers might call -plagiarism’’ and which ‘‘often suits the rhetorical needs and especially the epistemological values of the accounting community’’ (p. 348). Prior (1998, p. 136) reports an instance of what was apparently unattributed secondary citation in the work of the student he calls Mai. Mai cited one author (Erickson) but her text appears to have stronger similarities with another authors (McLaughlins) account of Erickson, along with language repeated from McLaughlin. Yet Prior shows that McLaughlins text in turn has language in common with Erickson, but not marked as quotation.

At least two explanations are available for these seemingly exceptional cases. On one hand, they may simply illustrate that unconventional source use is not limited to students. However, the case of the Murashige and Skoog medium seems to indicate either that university-wide prescriptions do not accurately reflect the practices of the disciplines, or that individuals may interpret general principles differently, or both. If so, one implication is that the source use documented here which appears to depart from accepted standards may in some cases simply signal adherence to a set of local standards. Another implication is that the task of novices learning to write in their disciplines may have an additional level of complexity: not only must they be observant of visible practices and somehow learn and negotiate the occluded practices, they must also be sensitive to the competing levels at which practice is regulated. Their task could be facilitated by research into the writing practices that are acceptable in the disciplines.

# 5. Conclusion

The findings presented here have pointed to the fact that fundamental aspects of academic writing are occluded and therefore go unaddressed, with the worrying consequence that students may leave the university with important writing skills unlearned. Even more worryingly, the writers studied here used sources in ways which might be labeled plagiarism, with potentially grave consequences should they apply the same writing strategies later in their academic careers.

Swaless (1996) discussion of occlusion has been extended here in two ways. First, occlusion has been shown to mask aspects of texts from established members of the academic discourse community as well as novices; and second, it has been applied not only to certain genres but to some features of visible genres. Other occluded features remain to be identified. Reporting verbs, for example, are evaluative (e.g., Thompson & Ye, 1991). To the experienced reader, factive reporting verbs (e.g., Stilton acknowledges $X$ ) and non-factive verbs (Stilton proposes $X$ ) convey quite distinct evaluations. Whether the evaluation which is signaled to the reader is that which is intended by the writer is ordinarily occluded to the reader. The chance that occlusion masks an unintended evaluation is, presumably, higher when the writer is less experienced, and when the writer is an NNSE.

Occlusion gave the texts studied here a superficial appearance of appropriateness, masking potential or actual problems which an ad hoc approach to thesis supervision could not reveal. This suggests that the project of learning about the occluded aspects of academic texts can be facilitated by an apprenticeship approach. It is worth noting that the thesis with the most appropriate source use, that of H2, included in its reference list a paper co-authored by the student with the supervisor. Although it would be wrong to read too much into this isolated case, it is possible that co-authoring a paper provided this student with an experience of situated learning.

Adding elements of apprenticeship to postgraduate advising may or may not be an achievable objective in practical terms. An apprenticeship approach calls on advisors to provide increased time, involvement and attention, all of which may simply not be compatible with the reality of academic work loads and the financial constraints under which academic institutions labor. However, the evidence provided by this study is that novice writers and their advisors expend considerable energy and attention in meeting those needs they can see. Some means of addressing the other, occluded demands of writing is necessary if postgraduate instruction is to address the full range of students learning, and not merely the visible tip of the iceberg.
