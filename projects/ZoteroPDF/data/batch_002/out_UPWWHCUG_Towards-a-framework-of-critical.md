# ABSTRACT

As one of the fundamental skills of the 21st century, critical thinking (CT) is a topic of considerable interest within the domain of assessing English for academic purposes (EAP). Recent literature on EAP instruction and assessment indicates that EAP has evolved beyond a strict focus on language improvement to encompass discourse competence and broader academic literacy development, with CT playing an important role in academic communication. A fundamental consideration in educational assessment is the construct that defines the knowledge, skills, or abilities to be assessed. However, CT has not received due attention in the research literature on EAP speaking assessment, thus raising a legitimate concern about its underrepresentation in the academic speaking construct. This study draws on Macqueen's (2022) distinction between theoretical, stated, perceived, and operationalized assessment constructs, with an aim to describe the EAP speaking assessment construct by including the concept of CT. By establishing alignment between what the literature indicates (theoretical), what assessment requires (stated), and how people understand assessment (perceived), a CT assessment framework is proposed to reflect how test takers experience it (operationalized). Our study contributes to a more nuanced conceptualization of CT in the context of EAP speaking, with implications for EAP speaking test development.

# 1. Introduction

As one of the fundamental skill of the 21st century, critical thinking (CT) is a topic of considerable interest within the domain of assesing English for academic purposes (EAP). CT is characterized by the comprehensive exploration of ssues before accepting or formulating an opinion, encompassing cognitive skill such as interpretation, analysis, evaluation, explanation, inference, and selfregulation (Facione, 1990). Fostering critical thinking ability in learners is an important part of schooing for any subject, and should be placed \*at the heart of EAP" (de Chazal, 2014, p. 12). CT is embedded in many EAP course curricula and syllai, and features prominentl in local developed in-house EAP assessments by EAP practitioner. Recent literature on EAP instruction and asesment indicates that EAP has evolved beyond a strict fcus on language improvement to encompass iscourse competence and broader academic litracy development, with CT playing an important role in content-building aspects of academic communication (de Chazal.

2014; Hyland & Shaw, 2016; Schmitt& Hamp-Lyons, 2015). This move, acknowledged by a large body of empirical research, reveals that CT skills are integral to academic English language proficiency (e.g., Chen et al., 2022; Stapleton, 2001; Stapleton & Wu, 015; Wilson, 2016; Yin et al, 2024). Therefore, EAP assessment should arguably include a CT component to mirr the communicative demands in the target language use (TLU) domain, i.e., academic English study.

However, a discrepancy often occurs between the diversity of practice and complexity of the construct. CT has not received due attention in the research literature on both standardized high-stakes EAP tests such as the IELTs (International English Language Testing Service) and TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) and locll developed in-house EAP tests, such as DELA (Diagnostic English Language Assessment), thus raising a legitimate concern about it being "under-defined" and \*under-theorized" within the academic speaking construct (Schmitt & Hamp-Lyons, 2015, p. 1) In the field of educational measurement, one of the most funda mental considerations is the construct that defines the knwledge, kills r abilities to be aessed. As such, the preent stdy draws on Macqueen's (2022) distinction between theoretical, stated, perceived, and operationalized asessment construct, with an aim to describe the EAP speaking assessment construct by including the concept f CT. We establish alignment between what the literature indicates about the construct of CT (theoretical) with a review of existing CT models what asessment requires of CT (stated) with an analysis of leading international academic English tests; and how people understand the assessment of CT (perceived) through interviews with domain experts. Based on our findings, we propose T assessment framework to reflect the key aspects and parameters in assesing students T abilit operationdlized. We hope this framework will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the concept of CT in the EAP speaking context whileoffering insights into how CT ability can beeffectively incorporated into EAP speaking assessment.

# 2. Literature review

In this section, we articulate the rationale for integrating CT in EAP speaking assessments and propose an approach for defining the EAP speaking assessment construct.

# 2.1. Understanding EAP speaking

English for academic purposes (EAP) isoften viewed as a way to support learners in their studies or research in English, and more recently it has expanded to encompass the communicative needs and practices in academic contexts (Hyland, 2018; Hyland & Shaw. 2016). EAP covers a wide array of academic communicative practices, including language teaching and asessment, academic skills training, and clasroom interactions. One of the most important questions in EAP assessment reearch and practice is how to delineate the ingustic dimensions of Englishused in the academic context (Norris et al., 2021). EAP teaching and asement typicall focus on the four language skills f reading, writing, listening, and speaking; however, additional skill and competencies such as CT skills are also often needed when applying and integrating these four skillsin academic setings, such as requring students to listen more analytically, red more thoughtully, and tospeak, as well a to writ, more ogically (Hadley & Boon, 2023, p.7). Acadmic language proficiency is considered as \*the language of argument, of analysis, and of explanation and reporting" (Davies, 2007, p. 85).

Academic English speakers are usually expected to be efective persuaders performing a variety of activities through spoken interactions. These interactions are meaning-driven, requring linguistic and non-lingustic kill for communicating ideas based on the input content. With the ever-changing competitive academic learning environment, however, an increasing focus is being put on broadening the construct of what is measured in spoken performances (Knoch, 2022). For instance, Khabbazbashi et al. (2022) rec onceptualized the construct of EAP assessment to reflect new and complex language use in higher eucation. In ascoping review of the literature, they found it necessary to broaden the construct by incorporating integrated skill to infuse multimodal communication. Specificall, they underscored the importance of discussion in AP speaking assessment, which requires the ability to present, support, and defend one's arguments on a given topic. In a similar vein, Palmour (2024) explored the construct of EAP oral presentation ability. Using questionnaire, interviews, rater discussions, and fieldwork, Palmour revealed a mismatch between what was stated in the rating criteria, and what was perceived by the test takers and teachers. The findings highlighted alck of emphasis on the multimodality of academic discourses within EAP oral presentation tasks while advocating for a greater focus on content over linguistic performance. Such a discrepancy may lead to construct underrpresentation where the assessment is not full representing the TLU domain.

One of the main reasons for this insufficiency could be that AP peaking involves a wide spectrum of activities nevertheless there are cases when EAP speaking tass and rating scales include only a limited set of linguistic ailities as part of the asessment construct (Khabbazbashi et al., 2022; Palmour, 2024). Fr example, complexity, accuracy, and fluency (CAF) are typically applied as a ripartite model characterizing learner performance in EAP speaking research. CAF i operationalized and incorporated in scales by focusing on student performance in terms of grammatical complexity, grammatical accuracy, and temporal, prosodic or lexical feature, respectively (House & Kuiken, 209). Non-linguistc abilities uch as thinking skill tend not tobeexplicitl reresented or delineated in the construct. In the process of preparing for EAP speaking activities such as seminars, presentations, debates, and discussions, however, CT also plays an important role (de Chazal, 2014). Compared with broad topics introduced in English for General Purposes, EAP topics tend to be more in-depth and specific, infused with various perspectives requiring a critical approach. More importantly, academic language is characterized by key featres related to CT elements such as valuation, stance, and voice (de Chazal, 2014). In this regard,

CT merits further investigation regarding its definition, components, as well as its relationship to EAP speaking proficiency.

# 2.2. Components of CT

Research on the concept of CT continues to stimulate interest in the field of education (e.g., Davies & Barnett, 2015; Hitchcock. 2017) aftr being the subject of many studies in the 1980s and 1990s. Considerable commonality can be detected regarding the component skill of CT. Theseskils are generally acknowledged by various groups of researchers; they include \*interpreting," \*rea soning/explaining," "self-regulating," "evaluating," "analyzing," and "inferencing" (Bloom, 1956; Ennis, 1987; Facione, 1990, 2011; Halpern, 2013; Paul, 1992; Paul & Elder, 2001; Watson & Glaser, 2002). Researchers have aso made comprehensive summaries of these CT skills (ee Dong, 2015; Lai, 2011 i & Liu, 2021; Liu et l., 2014; Tomas & Lok, 2015). Apart from a set of skill, there is a consensus that  should also incorporat n individual's disposition, an internal motivation or willingnes o exert the mentaleffort to apply the CT skills (Dewey, 1933;Facione, 2000; Profetto-McGrath, 2003; Rimiene, 2002). Researchers describe thinking dispositions as a key part of the executive control system, serving as a metacognitive function for selfregulating thought (Dwyer et al., 2014; Marzano, 2001). These habits of mind in CT include open-mindedness, inquisitiveness,systematicity, the tendency to seek out altenatives self-onfidnce, and the wllngness to elf-correct (Baiin et al, 999; Dwy, 1933; Ennis 1987; Fcione 1990; alpen 1998, 2003, Paul, 1992), and can be grouped into three categories: conitive components (e.g., analyticity, systematicity), personality components (e.g., self-onfidence, cognitive maturity), and motivational components (e.g., open-mindedness truth-seeking, inquisitiveness) (Cui et al., 2021).

These skills and dispositions are regarded as applicable to \*all subjects in all culture" (Paul & Elder, 2014, p. 128). However, few studies have been conducted to disentangle the relationship between these pecific CT skillsdispositions and EAP learning, making it difficult to generalize this ability across disciplines and teach or assess CT in an EAP setting.

# 2.3. Role of CT in EAP speaking

Teaching and practicing speaking skill is important because EAP demands the efort to master both linguistc and non-linguistic skills For example, debate i commonly used in AP speaking activities, where one side afirms a position, and the other side argues against it. Debate is associated with the ability to speak and think clearly and is useful for fostering students' CT abilit (Chen et al. 2022; Iman, 2017; Mitchel, 2000). Accordingly, to evaluate debaters depth of CT, Chen et al. (2022) adopted a content analysis framework. The main indicators of the debaters' depth of CT included the ability to: clear up ambiguitie; link and interpret ideas (interpreting"); generate new data from information collcted (inferencing"); provide examples; justify solutions or judgments (\*explaining"); discuss advantages and disadvantages of solutions (\*analyzing"); and critically evaluate one's own and others' contributions ("evaluating"). They found that teams participating in the debate activity with higher scores exhibited a higher average depth of CT. These research findings echo a meta-analysis of 341 CT interventions conducted by Abrami et a. (2008, 2015) who found several pedagogical practices that were important in reviewed CT interventions, among which one-on-one interaction, dialogue, or debate were considered the most effective ways to promote students' CT.

Although there i a lack of research providing a comprehensive picture of what specific CT sils are required in EAP speaking, one study provides a direction forward. Li and Liu (2021) investigated the taxonomy of CT in EFL learning for Chinese senior middle scool students. They explored the construct by selecting kill items using the Cambridge CT framework (Black, 2012) as the baseline while interviewing six teachers. Through content analysis, followed by rounds of revision of skills and indicators, they developed a framework of CT skills required in EFL learning comprised of five CT skills and 58 indicators. This framework provides a comprehensive list of CT kills subskill, and indicators, enriching the T concept by contextualizing it in EFL lening. For FL speaking, ive CT skill - analyzing, evaluating, inferencing, synthesizing and slf-regulating - were included, with indicators such as expressing opinions, developing arguments with examples and data, and making inferences. Although this framework offers a thorough examination of C skill in foreign language leaning, it does not provide criteria for evaluating  in language practices, making itdifficult to apply this framework in rating students CT in their speaking performance. These studies reveal the CT skils practitioners should attend to when evaluating speaking; however, these T skill or dispositions have not been explicitly reflected and defined in descriptions of EAP speaking constructs; nor have they ben reported or included in existing EAP speaking rating scales partly because definitions of CT remain abstract or intangible. And perhaps more importantly, unlike the measurement of CT in other asessments such as writing, its evaluation in speaking performance presents unique challenges because the spontaneous nature of spech makes real-time assessment dificult. The evaluation of CT is inherently reflective and involves multiple dimensions, including CT skills intellectual standards, and CT dispositions. Therefore it is important to develop a clear understanding of CT within the context of EAP speaking assessment.

# 2.4. Defining the speaking assessment construct

Macqueen (2022) presented a four-dimensional construct definition for speaking assessment: theoretical, operationalized, stated and perceived. The theoretical construct depicts the knowledge, skill, or abilities to be assessed. The operationalized construct is the representation of the theoretical by eliciting samples of the observed performance and making judgements about their quality, while considering the assesment context. Three layers f context, i., socital, inrastructural, and simulation, are assumed to be rooted in the operationalized construct, with each functioning differently. The operationalized construct, developed from the societal layer, is constructed through the infrastructural lyer, and is put into efect in a simulation layer (Macqueen, 2022). Apart from these two construct dimensions that are central intest design and validation reearch, social activitie play a pivotal role n assessment practices and therefore the two other dimensions are added to the construct. Astated construct is communicated to different stakeholders in various forms such as sample materials, curriculum documents, and rating scale descriptors. The perceived construct is the in. terpretations of the test construct by the stakeholders, which includes, for example, both assessors and asesees understanding of the rating scale. Among these four dimensions, operationalized constructs are particularly complicated and fundamental because they are influenced by the context experienced by the asessees. To elucidate the nature of construct activity, greater coherence must be achieved between what the literature indicates (theoretical), the requirements of the asessment (stated), the understanding of the assesment by stakeholders (peceived), and the experiences of test takers (operationalized). Notably, Macqueen's construct definition has proven useful in clarifying and decribing the characterisics of construct activity in EAP speaking contexts (e.g., Palmour, 2024. Therefore, in the present study, we adopt this approach to define the construct of EAP speaking context while incorporating and framing the concept of CT.

The research questions that guided our study were as follows:

1. What role does CT play in the theoretical, stated, and perceived EAP speaking assessment construct?   
2. How is CT operationalized in an EAP speaking assessment construct?

# 3. The study design

The study comprised three phases. We began by discussing the theoretical asessment construct for EAP speaking with a review of existing CT models. Next, we reviewed the rating scales of a few leading, large-scale standardized EAP peaking tests to examine how CT is currntly conceptualized in EAP speaking assessment tasks and rating scales to provide evidence for the stated assessment constructs. This was followed by a description of our interviews with domain experts to explore the perceived construct. The findings from these three phases led to our design of a CT assessment framework for EAP speaking which represents its operationalized construct.

# 3.1. Participants

We interviewed five domain experts who have special knowledge in CT and EAP. These experts were grouped into two categories based on their backgrounds and experience (Table 1). The irst goup comprised three domain experts who were scholars experienced in the field of CT within the context of language learning (ie., Eric, Earl, and Evan). They specialized in CT-related research and teacher education in higher education and CT literacy, and had published articles about CT. The second group comprised two EAP teachers with experience in teaching EAP courses at the university level(ie., Taylor and Tim). The experts had worked in several universities in Asia, including mainland China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), Macau SAR, and Japan. We conducted one-on-one semi-structured interviews with each domain expert to atain their beliefs about the construct of CT, its teaching, learning and assessment, and task features of EAP tests. The interviews were conducted in either Chinese or English based on the experts' preference.

# 3.2. Data collection and analysis

The proposed conceptual framework of CT is mainly drawn from three data sources: a literature review of the existing CT models, a systematic analysis of the rating scales and task types of leading EAP speaking assessments, and the in-depth semi-structured interviews with the five domain experts.

The review of the existing CT models in the literature was conducted in several stages, commencing with the identification of relevant litrature and screning for its appropriateness In the irst stage, to identif the relevant litrature, major databases in psychology, linguistics, and education were searched, including ERIC Ebsco, Web of Sciences Citation Index, Scopus, and PsycInfo. Relevant keywords for the topic were identified and used in combination for the search, including: \*language education AND critical thinking model, anguag education AND critical thinking framework, anguag education AND critical thinking sessment" and "academic English AND thinking skill." In the second stage, the articles were scrutinized todetermine whether they fulfild the inclusion criteria: 1) they had to be published in peer-reviewed research journals in psychology, education and linguistcs which have proposed or operationalized CT models, and 2) the terms critical thinking" and "ramework/model" had to appear in the keywords or constitute the primary focus of the paper. The search yielded 14 articlesfrom Scopus, 25 from Web of Science, 16 from ERIC EBsco, and14 from PsychInfo. However, 41 were excluded since they were duplicated records and failed to meet the inclusion criteria. As a result, 28 ful texts of the documents were retrieved and included for the analysis in the subsequent phase. In the third phase, the retrieved full texts of these papers were analyzed in terms of the research foci, sources of CT conceptualization, measurement of CT, methods of data collection, data analys and reporting. Careful reading and rereading of the collcted articles yielded three categories of CT models: theory-based, research-based, and integrated.

In addition, two high-stakes international academic English tests i. IELTS and TOEFL iBT) and one local large-scale standardized academic English tes (i.., the College English est were ystematically reviewed regarding their task types and ratig cales. IELTS and TOEFL iBT are internationall renowned larg-scale, high-stakes tests designed to asses academic language skill. The CET is a curriculum-based EAP test battery in mainland China designed to promote the learning of English at thetrtiary level, consisting of two levels, i.e., CET-4 and CET-6 (Fan et al., 2022). As part of the ET battery, the CET-Spoken English Tet (CET-SET) is a computer-based EAP speaking test, comprising several monologic tasks and a paired discussion task.

The semi-structured interviews, conducted on Zoom, were based on interview protocols that included two parts: 1) perceptions of CT and 2) the role of CT in EAP contexts (see Appendix A). Each interview lasted for about one hour. The interviews were rcorded with the participants consent and subsequenly transcribed verbatim for analysis. elected excerpts in Chinese were translated into English. The interview data were analyzed thematicaly, ollowing Braun and Clarke (2006), who defined thematic analysis as a "'method for identifying, analysing, and reporting pattrns (themes) within data" (p. 79). Data were coded by the first author and another researcher in applied linguistics using NVivo 12 (QSR International Pty Ltd, 2018). For the first $2 0 \%$ of the total data, intercoder reliability was $9 0 \%$ . The first author coded the rest of the data.

The coding was conducted in two cycles (Saldana, 2009). In the irs cycle, the raw data were read and re-read and initially coded on the transcripts. Then \*repetitive patterns" (Saldana, 2009, p. 5) were identified by examining similarities in various codes. The second cycl prioritized focused coding (aldana, 2009, p. 155)to examine the most frequent and salient initial codes and then group them under th focused sub-themes that emerged during the proces. This procedure was useful for categorizing and grouping the final codes under the themes. Finally, the codes generated from the interview were compared and grouped into several sub-themes under the main themes (see Table 3).

# 4. Results and discussion

In this section, we present and discuss the findings in relation to the role of CT in theoretical, stated and perceived assessment constructs. We also explore the theoretical and practical implications of these indings for the operationalization of CT in EAP speaking context.

# 4.1. CT in theoretical assessment constructs

In the field of educational measurement, an assessment framework serves to link theoretical models with assessment tass. A theoretical model has to reflect a construct in a variety of context, while an assessment framework depicts the construct within particular contexts (Chalhoub-Deville, 1997). Therefore, an asessment framework should be related to its associated theoretical model but is more practical because it can be readily applied to test construction. It has been cautioned that seking a common model to serve all urposes in language asessment can be problematic therefore, an operational model/asessment framework that can be applied to a specific context needs to be constructed (Henning & Cascalla, 1992). Defining CT is dificult due to its elusive nature (Ennis, 1993); however, a model of CT serves as a good starting point for providing an accurate persective and clear representation of

the process underlying the exercise of CT ability (McLean, 2005).

Our coding results of the existing literature on CT reveal that existing CT models fallinto three categories - theory-based, research. based, and integrated. Theory-based models are mostly based on a designed taxonomy of CT abilities and dispositions (e.g., Brookfield, 1987; Ennis, 1987; Paul & Elder, 2001). For example, several researchers adopted Bloom's (1956) six-level taxonomy of higher-order thinking skill, along with its revised model by Anderson and Krathwohl (2001), which includes the cognitive skils of "remembering" "understanding," "applying," "analysing," "evaluating," and "creating," and then they integrated this CT framework into their EFL curriculum and asssment (e.g., Awada, 2022; Soe, 2024). Another case in point is the T model proposed by Paul and Elder (2001), which has been widely applied in various EFL assessment contexts, including speaking (Wagner, 2019), reading (Leist et al., 2012), writing (Dong, 2017), and overall academic performance (Hohmann & Grillo, 2014). Paul and Elder (2001) provided a three-dimensional model that involves not only elements of thoughts (ie., T kills) and intelectal traits (.., CT dispositions), but also nine intllectal standards, which are useful for ealuating the quality of thinking. These standards include clarity of statements, accuracy of information, precision of tatements, relevance of ideas, depth of thought, breadth of viewpoints, logic, significance of information and farnes of arguments. This holistic model i applicable to various subject matter; however, broad gneralizability may come at the cost of validity for addressing a speific asessment task. This model fail to take context into ccount, leading to problems applying the theory in practice.

Research-based models tend to practically consider empirical cognitive psychology investigating how key elements can be applied to the CT proces (Halonen, 1995). For example, Kaczko and Ostendorf (2023) conducted a systematic review of the role of CT in a community of inquiry framework used in online teaching in higher education based on empirical research on cognitive presence. sing thematic analysis, the study indicated that meaning construction and knowledge confirmation are the main characteristics of CT in the community of inquiry context. In a similar context, Nelson and Rhoney (2023) utilized a grounded-theory approach to analyze the experts fedback from student-written think-aloud protocols about CT exercised in students professional education. They identified five essential standards of clinical reasoning: "accurate," "specific," \*thorough," \*connected," and "concise," each of which can be mapped to the intellectual traits in Paul and Elder's (2001) tripartite model. However, these key elements are usually not explicitly described in EAP contexts and warrant more theoretical underpinnings.

Integrated models have been proposed to balance the theoretical with the practical (e.g., Dwyer et al., 2014; McLean, 205; Ruan, 2015). For instance, Dwyer et al. (2014) proposed an integrative framework for CT, with memory/knowledge and comprehension as the basi f th scsl apicof  kill i, ayis ion, nd fe), tot th ef uctions of metacognition and reflective udgment monitoring the whole thinking proces. However, the purpose f their framework was for CT training, not for its asessment or evaluation. In another study, McLean (2005) integrated the strengths of the existing theory- and research-based CT models and developed two complementary models of CT to analyze students' CT within the context of computer conferencing where students interacted online with other leaners and instructors. One model was used to categorize the types of CT displayed by students; the other was used for evaluating their CT quality. However, the author admitted that using two models at the same time was neither practical in teaching nor useful in testing.

In sum, these existing models were typically conceptualized in broad educational contexts, hence their pplicability for assessing CT in a specific context such as EAP speaking remains unclear. Therefore, exploring theoretical and practical isues of including CT in EAP speaking assessment appears timely.

# 4.2. CT in stated assessment constructs

Tasks and rating scales are the cornerstones of L2 speaking assessment. Tass are used to elit asample of speech and should be chosen so that valid inferences can be made from tes cores to asessment constructs (Fan & Yan, 2020). A rating scale is the oper ational representation of the test construct (Knoch & Macqueen, 2020). I research on asessing EAP speaking, test takers content quality has received increasing attention (e.g., Brown, 2007; Brown et al., 2005; Frost et al., 2020, 2021; Sato, 2012). Instead of focusing mainly on linguisic features such as accuracy and sophistication, rater (and the associated EAP-oriented rating scales they use) have also incorporated the content or ideas in test takers peaking that allude to CT abilit. Table2 summarizes the type of tasks, test formats and content-related feture in the scoring cririaf the three standardizd AP peaking aessments i., Es, TOEFL iBT, and CET-SET6).

Regarding tas format, the IES speaking component consists of three parts i.., introduction, individual long term, and two-way discussion) in a face-to-face interview between the test taker and an IELTS-trained examiner. The belief in using dialogues to develop CT can be traced back to the Socratic method, in which concepts are shaped and clarified through discussion. Critical dialogue can be adversarial or cooperative, thus demonstrating a speaker's CT ability to defend and organize arguments. Is instructional value has been widely recognized both in EAP and CT studies (Abrami et al., 2015; Davies & Barnett, 2015; de hazal, 2014). Unlike the two-way assessor-assee discussion with scripted questions in the IELT, the CET-SET involves test takers of equal status participating in a discussion task They are required to exchange ideas and expressfeelings or emotions, engage in debate or agument, give explanations and make comparisons, while using appropriate oral communicationstrategies (National College English Testing Committee 1999, 2016). Apart from the dialogic task, the monologic task in EAP speaking assessment i typicallyargumentative, measuring the test takers ability to state facts, give reasons and opinions, and describe phenomenon. Oral argumentation is a typical language activity in EAP classooms that enhances both argumentative sills and speaking proficiency (Jin et al., 2019). Demonstrating skills in argumentation is one f the most distinguishing features of astrong critical thinker (Davies, 2015). Therefore, argumentative tasks have been widely applied in EAP speaking tests, such as the TOEFL iT independent speaking section, wherestudents are required to present their ideas, opinions, and experiences on an issue. Another feature of the TOEFL iBT speaking test that differ from the IELTS and the CET-SET is the use of integrated tasks, requiring test takers to incorporate more than one linguistic skil, i.e., by reading and/or listening to content input first, then responding appropriately. Along with linguistic competence, such tasks require higher-order abilitiesuch as using organizational devices to connect and develop ideas effectively and to convey content accurately and comprehensively (Xi et al., 2021).

Regarding the rating scales, the descriptors in all three speaking tests involve content-related features. The descriptors use ad. jectives such as "coherent" and \*cler" and adverbs like "fully" and \*appropriately to describe the content quality. Test takers ideas feature prominently in the content-related criteria, which motivate them to reflect on the quality of their content. For instance, in the TOEFL iBT, candidates are expected to establish coherent connections betwen ideas, thoroughly develop their topics, and effectively communicaterelevant information. These stated competencies implicitly mirror CT skils such as \*interpretation' (comprehending and articulating the topic at hand), "analysis (examining the issue from various angles), and "evaluation (appraising and using evidence to bolster arguments. However, the wording in these current EAP speaking rating criteria tends to be vague and offers ittleclarity about the construct being assessed, making it dificul for the rater to make a clear judgment. Thus, enriching the descriptors of content-related features in EAP speaking rating citria by incorporating key CT skils and making them explicit and foregrounded can address the issue of construct underrepresentation or fuzziness.

Our analysis indicated that the design of al thre tests rating scales focuses on various aspects of CAF, with insuficient emphasis on the quality of meaning-related aspects such as CT. EAP-stated assessment constructs in in-house speaking asessments at times include relatively narrow linguistic aspects in accordance with the specific task affordances of multimodal assessments (Palmour 2024). However, the criteria that encompass CT features are typically implicit, suggesting a need for these aspects to be more prominently emphasized.

# 4.3. CT in perceived assessment constructs

The five experts' perceived CT constructs revealed values and pitall associated with theoretical and stated constructs. Table 3   
presents the results of the themes and sub-themes identfied in the interview data. The first theme concened the general concept ofCT,   
with two assciated subthemes being identified: 1) CT components, which rfers to the theoretical underpinnings that were frequently   
mentioned by the experts, and 2) the CT characteristics, indicated by the features identified in generic and specific contexts. The   
second theme is the role of CT in EAP contexts, with three asociated subthemes: 1) content quality, related to content sophistication;   
2) discourse, represented by the speaking acts provided by the speakers and 3) challenges, i., the concerns expressed by the experts. In what follows, we detail the domain experts' perceptions of the concept of CT and its role in EAP contexts.

# 4.3.1. CT concept

The three CT experts (ie., ric, Earl, and Evan) generally understood that the concept of CT is based on a skills-plus-disposition perspective. In line with the litrature, they believed that T skills were related to the cognitive dimension of the concept, including interpretation, analysis, evaluation, explanation, inference, and self-regulation. Two of them (Earl and Evan), however, believed these skills were also a representation of test-takers' language-related competence in an academic seting; one expert (Eric) noted the affective dimension of CT but mentioned that it was not related to language competence. Earl said the cognitie aspect of CT is most related to AP speaking and is more easily detected and evaluated in AP contexts such as the abilit to analyze from different perspectives and make inferences' (Earl. One EAP teacher (Taylor) likened CT to higher-order thinking in Bloom's taxonomy. As discussed in the literature, Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives was developed for the purpose f enhancing education and the way that thinking is examined in the classrom, contributing to an understanding of the cognitive processes in CT (Dwyer, 2011). However, as reflected by Taylor, Bloom's taxonomy does not fully capture the concept of CT:

Bloom's taxonomy canot provide the guidance we can follow because it is oo vague and there are no accompanying criteriafor judging the outcome. A comprehensive systematization of CT skills in the Delphi report [by Facione (1990)] can complement the vagueness in Bloom's taxonomy. (Taylor)

The experts also agreed that CT was both generic and context specific, especiall for teaching and learning CT in EFL situations. CT kill represent a set of discrete and generic traits i eaning that can be generalized cross variety of contexts. n the other hand, it lemonstrates uniqueness to a subject domain because thinking should be tied to the content.

As one expert summarized:

T is generic to all people, which includes specific Cr skill such as analysis, evaluation, and inference. However, as a higher-order function and display, CT is contextualized in different subjects, content knowledge, and specific tasks. (Eric)

This understanding aligns with current trends that portray CT as a discipline-specific construct because of its integration with content knowledge and its multidisciplinary application (Moore, 2017; Rear, 2019). However, there is stil a lack of research on contextualizing the concept of CT in EFL and EAP learning and asessment (Li & Liu, 2021, 2023; Stapleton & Wu, 2015; Yin et al., 2024).

# 4.3.2. Content quality

The experts said they focused on two major aspects when asessing CT in EAP. The first is content quality, which includes the \*wide coverage of different aspects [breadth] and a deeper understanding featuring multidimensional viewpoints and an action-oriented mindset [depth]\* (Eric). One expert (Earl) provided a vivid example of an exercise he gave to his students in an EAP-oriented context regarding depth of thought. His students were provided with a study that looked at the grades and behavior of elementary school pupils. The study found that pupils who ate breakfast had higher grades than those who did not.

Earl's students were required to discuss this study and explain the reasoning behind the results. After discussing, the students typically responded that pupils who had a full breakfast were more likely to enter school with a fullstomach with normal lod sugar levels. Because of this, these pupils would be better prepared for learning and i etter physical condition than those who had not eaten breakfast, which resulted in their higher grades.

Upon hearing the students' responses, Earl urged them to think more deeply because the explanations offered, while correct, were rather superficial. He explained the argument he was hoping for:

Pupils who don't have breakfast are more likely to come from lower-class families. Or they may be children of single-parent families or broken homes. In such cases, parents or guardians are less likely to help their children with homework, or they may have less money to pay for afer-school tutoring, leading to their children's lower grades. Thus, the matter of eating breakfast is more likely to be a symbol of the pupils socio-economic status, rather than a question of nutrtional energy. Explanations such as this reveal slow and deep thinking in an academic context and are more satisfying. (Earl)

Such reasoning showcases strong critical thinking and analytical depth. The approach set out in this example involves a decon. struction of the subject mater, systematically exploring deeer causes and repercussions. Strong critical thinkers not only consider the apparent aspects but also explore the underlying complexitie, revealing a nuanced understanding. Their capacity to discern subtle nuances, anticipate potential counterarguments, and synthesize information reflets a sophisticated thinking process This comprehensive and detailed approach sets the strong critical thinker apart, highlighting a mastery of analytical skils, a commitment to thorough examination, and a direct link to content sophistication.

# 4.3.3. Discourse features

The second aspect is discourse. Strong critical thinkers can use a variety of coherent discourse acts, such as interpretation, analysis comparison, evaluation, predication, imagination, and recommendation (Eric). Unlike strategic competencies, discourse acts are content-based and context-oriented.\*Strategic competency reflcts an abilit to facilitate and foster a converstion, while discourse acts are more about bulding the content" (Taylor). Inthis regard, diverse discourse acts are essential for building meaningful and thoughtful content. Discourse acts should be exercised in a certain context, as Eric commented, just like the skillof self-correction, I don't think it is something people would normally do in academic speaking unless they are self-correcting grammar."

# 4.3.4. Challenges

The experts voiced their concerns about the methods used to asess CT regarding both task design and rating scales in EAP speaking tests. For task design, some experts stated that current speaking or writing prompts can elicit only a limited number of CT aspects. The experts agreed that the types of exercises or tasks, and even the prompts, on high-stakes tests tended to be very narrowly based on simplistic argumentation. They noticed that on high-stakes language tests, many types of prompts were more appropriate for argumentative speaking such as a debate prompt (., whether IT is positive development, or whether AI is ood for society). However, as Earl argued, \*such prompts touch on only one aspect of CT. As he continued, I think those kinds of arguments are not necessrily real. life problems. There's a whole other side to thinking which relates to cognitive biases that we se in society that are really dangerous." He then stessed the importance of using CT skills to avoid such biases. These biases include: selectively recalling information that supports existing beliefs (i., \*confirmation bias); jumping to the most obvious causes (i.. the availability heristic"); failure to note how measurements of a variable tend to fluctuate around an average (i.e., \*randomness" and "\*regression to the mean'); and making judgments about the likelihood of an event by favoring case-specific phenomena over relevant statistical informatin (i. "base rate"), as described by Nobel Laureate Danial Kahneman in his book, Thinking Fast and Slow (Kahneman, 2011). Earl explained that "CT can promote good decision making in writing academic papers and speaking about academic topics.'

This inherent complexity of CT exemplifies another key atribute of high-qualit thinking in EAP and beyond, i.e., the abilit to avoid cognitive biases. Cognitive biases can influence decision-making processes when articulating ideas in academic language. Therefore, having both an awareness of these biases and the ability to overcome them should be indicative of a proficient critical thinker, a level of mastery atained by only a select group of tudents; thus, \*repeated exposure to and practice with various research scenarios are required to build such an ideal critical thinker' (Earl).

In sum, in line with the literature, from a conceptual point of view, the experts understood that CT included both skill and disposition components. They said that Cr skill encompassed cognitive dimensions, i., interpretation, analysis, evaluation, explanation, inference, and self-regulation; CT dispositions included characterisics such as confidence, open-mindedness, and truth.

seeking. The cognitive aspect of CT was believed to be most related to EAP speaking, and it could exert a strong influence on the content quality/sophistication of the EAP speaking performance. On an operational level, the EAP experts agreed that the rating scales and task designs in existing large-scale standardized EAP speaking tests could elicit students' CT but only in a very limited way. Therefore, any CT asessment framework contextualized for EAP speaking should contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the construct.

# 5. Towards a CT framework in EAP speaking context.

Situated in the context of EAP speaking, we draw on several of the strengths discussed above: 1) theory- and research-based CT models; 2) interviews with the domain experts; 3) methods of defining speaking constructs; and 4) contextual facets of a speaking task to propose a CT framework for EAP speaking assessment (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1 is a graphic representation of a CT asessment framework showing how each component fits together conceptually. The Critical Thinking box is the core component encompassing two parts: CT sills and dispositions. CT skill represent the fundamental language-related thinking proceses of a student's performance. They include: 1) interpreting (the ability to understand and convey issues under discussion by synthesizing the information and clarifying the meaning (Facione, 1990; Paul & Elder, 2014); 2)"analyzing" (the abilit to examine ideas and detect aruments) (Black, 2012; Facione, 1990; Li et al., 2014) 3) "aluating (the ability t asses claims and arguments) (Facione, 1990; Guo et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2014; Manalo & Sheppard, 2016); 4) "explaining" (the abilit to state results and justify procedures while constructing new concepts) (Facione, 1990; Liu et a., 2014); 5) inferencing (the abilit to draw conclusions and consider altenatives (Facione, 1990; Liu et al., 2014) and 6) \*regulating (the ability to reflect on oneself and others (Facione, 1990; Yin et al., 2024). CT dispositions are the non-language-related characteristics that contribute to good CT. Contextualizing disposition into an EAP speaking context requires categorizing it into cognitive, personality, and motivational components (Cui et al., 2021; Facione, 1990; Saxton et al., 2012). The \*cognitive component" concerns an individual's understanding of knowledge and reality, while the \*personality" and \*motivational components" are concerned with the est taker's characteristics. Table 4 presents a more detailed description of the skils and dispositions of the T assessment framework, along with the foci for assesing each dimension. In addition to CT skils and dispositions, our interviews with the domain experts and engagement with the literature as well as Greek etymology) indicated the insearable role of criteria/standard in the conceptualization of CT (Baii t al. 1999; Paul & Elder, 2014). Therefore, we propose six criteria to asess the quality of CT processes and outcomes (se Table 5) 1) "clarity is agateway standard requiring aclear, specific, and detailed statement; 2) \*relevance" demands a direct connection to the question at hand; 3) "logicality focuses on the way students put their ideas together; 4) "breadth' and 5)"depth" concern how broad and deep a test taker's thoughts are toward the complexities underlying the issue; and 6) "fairness" refers to how statements are justified (Paul & Elder, 2014; Wagner, 2019). Specific questions that guide the relevant standards are presented in Table 5.

The context in which communication takes place is pivotal in language assment development. Our framework is stuated within the EAP context, where academic English is used to build meaning. At the top of Fig. 1 i the \*EAP speaking asessment situation box, which includes aspects of the academic situation representing important facets in the speaking assessment. Two major aspects, i., speaking task characteristics and individual differences, are stipulated considering their ignificant role in L2 speaking performance (Kormos & Prefontaine, 2017; Suzuki e l., 2022). Speaking task characteristics" describes the types of tasks that elicit CT amongtest takers, including the physical location of the communication taking place and the design of tasks that participants are required to perform. Individual difference" refers to the test takers' individual characteristics, including their psychological characteristics, in terests, or motivation to complete task, and their experiential characteristics, ie, educational and cultural background (see Taylor Geranpayeh, 2011). Focusing on a particular speaking task, the box, "Contextual facets of a speaking task" includes four parts: "intended language use domain," which represents a sub-context in the domain of EAP speaking; \*spch genres," which is the type of language used in performing certain tasks, such as argumentative speech and debate; \*communication goal' concerns language function in EAP contexts such as defending viewpoints, persuading others or synthesizing information; and \*communication medium refers to the form used to accomplish a speaking task, which can take the form of monologic, dialogic, or integrated speech (Chapelle et al., 1997).

"Content elaboration' is one of the most important elements of EAP speaking asessment in which CT is characterized as a com bination of ffetive dispositions, conitive kill, and quality of standards. valuating the content that test-takers convey is aways one of the major priorities in EAP speaking tests (Sato, 2012). Content meaningfulness or sophistication directly reflects test takers oral proficiency (Brown, 2007; Brown et al., 2005). Meaningfulnessthus leads to the "academic speaking performance' box in Fig. 1.

# 6. Conclusion and future directions

This paper explores the construct of CT in the context of EAP speaking asessment. To address RQ1, we reviewed the existing CT models, highlighting their limited representation in the theoretical constructs. The role of CT underlying the task types and rating scales of the leading EAP speaking tests was investigated to shed light on the stated assessment constructs. The perceived asesment constructs were discussed through interviews with domain experts. CT was found to be underrepresented in the stated constructs a finding that resonated in the theoretical and perceived constructs. Exploring conflicts within perspectives and practices can enhance the alignment between stated constructs and perceived constructs (Macqueen, 2022). Finally, in addressing RQ2, our findings lent support for operationalizing CT in EAP speaking contexts, culminating in the establishment of a CT assessment framework.

Theoretically, this framework identifies and defines the components of CT and the thee layers embedded in operationalized EAP speaking construct. Among the three, the \*socital laer of asesment stands out because of is broad cope i also includes a variety of language phenomenon for social sorting (Knoch & Macqueen, 2020). This ayer i related to the \*EAP speaking asessment situation) and "Contextual facets of aspeaking task' in the CT asessment framework where the intention of language use, speech genre, or communication medium can shft around the urpose of the test In the asesment infrastructral' layer, the sils and criteria of the CT assessment framework are established so that tes takers CT performance can be made observable regarding contextual facets of a speaking task. Final, the "simulation laye s realized through an individual's dierent intractions with the task characteristics in a real assessment situation, which is mediated through CT disposition.

On a practical level, because there i frequently a disconnect between the CT concepts that are taught and those that are asessed (Dwyer et al., 2014), the proposed assessment framework helps expose these relationships by defining key CT components for eal. uating the quality of the meaning-related aspects of EAP speaking performances. This model established a clear baseline for what constitutes good quality content in an EAP speaking performance. Our conceptualization of CT can enrich the EAP speaking construct by foregrounding it role in content elaboration. Additionaly, this framework can guide the processof construct validation, a core component of language asessment. Since validity is \*"an inductive summary of both the existing evidence for and the potential consequences of score interpretation and use (Messck, 1989, p.13), this framework can provide meaningful test interpretations by referring to each element within the framework The framework can also clarify key considerations in the practice f EAP asssment in terms of task design, rating scale development, and collecting evidence to support test validit. Notably, however, this framework does not intend to be exhaustie; rather, it can sere as a practical tolkit that can e reerred to for AP peaking asessment developers and validation researchers.

Our framework is not without limitations. Firstly, more empirical research should be conducted to confirm its validity. While the current study mainly situates the framework within the context of large-scale standardized assessments, it is equally important to extend this framework to explore the constructs of CT that are being employed by EAP practitioners in small-scale, locally developed in-house speaking tests and clssom-based assessment. Research efforts in these varied assessment contexts can offer valuable insights into the validity and practicality of this framework in practice. We also encourage the involvement of multiple stakeholders in this exploration, including test takers, EAP teachers, score users, EAP test developers, and professonals from the language testing community. Their diverse perspectives and expertise may contribute to the enhancement of CT assessment practices.

More research is aso needed to disentangle the inextricable relationship between CT and other thinking kills for example creative thinking (Wechsler et al., 2018) and system thinking (Grohs et l., 2018). Thus, we encourage further research investigating how CT can be infused into EAP learning, teaching, and asesment. In addition, given the inherent complexity of real-time speaking assess ments and the substantial cognitive load the assessments place on raters, the proposed CT framework-which centers around a comprehensive set of CT skills and criteria-may present challnges in terms of practical implementation in assessment design. To address these challenges, we recommend that test designers customize their ssessment tols by selectively focusing on or grouping specific CT skils and criteria in accordance with the testing purposes and contexts. By doing so, test designers can focus on more targeted and relevant asesment constructs. This adaptation willfacilitate the practical and flexibl interation of CT assment into various EAP speaking tasks by prioritizing the most salient CT features that align with their specific educational goals, thereby maximizing the usefulness f the assessment. Another potential ssue is that due to the analysis of construct dimensions spanning a variety of contexs (e.g, large-scalestandardized and in-houseassessments), there could be an inherent mismatch between stated and perceived constructs Further research should explore the concept of CT within aligned and specified contexts to address these potential discrepancies.

Finall, our proposed framework has arrived in an era of considerable disruption of educational asessment with the advance of generative AI and its associated tools such as ChatGPT. As students are now able to use these tools to generate written prose after entering prompts, there are concerns that they are submitting thir written assignments without fully exercising thir powers of CT (Kasneci et al., 2023). Such ascenario has highlighted the importance of EAP speaking asessment, which is les prone to the influence of generative AI.

# Interview protocol

I would like to express my sincere gratitude for your time in this interview. I am currently working on my thesis entitled Assesing Critical Thinking in EAP Speaking: Design and Validation of a Rating Scale'. The aim of this project is to design and validate a rating scale in EAP speaking to asses students citical thinking ailit. In the current stage, I am collecting data on the conceptualization of the CT construct from domain experts to inform the rating categories. I believe your expertise in the fild of CT would be invaluable to my research.
