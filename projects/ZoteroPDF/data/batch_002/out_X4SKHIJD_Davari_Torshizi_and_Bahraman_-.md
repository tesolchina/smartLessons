Partnership in higher education emphasises an active role for students in both teaching and learning. This pedagogical culture is likely to make students assessment literate and engage them in deep learning. In this study, Iranian students experiencing learning-by-teaching (LbT) in private language institutes were interviewed to compare their perceptions toward assessment and learning with their counterparts without this experience. Findings show that LbT fosters students’ assessment literacy and deep learning. Results also reveal that by teaching other students, quasi-teachers promote a broader understanding of assessment and grade practices in comparison to other students. Unlike their counterparts, quasi-teachers de-emphasised grades and showed a greater focus on learning. Moreover, explaining the materials to other students provided them with a deeper cognitive process resulting in deeper learning. These results underscore the perceived importance of partnership in higher education.

# 1. Introduction

There is compelling evidence that assessment profoundly influences student learning and approaches (e.g., Gibbs & Simpson, 2002). Importantly, it leads to real and deep learning if students’ assessment literacy is enhanced as well. In their attempts to develop the concept of assessment literacy, Price, Rust, O’Donovan, Handley, and Bryant (2012, 7) stresses that ‘for students to reach their potential in terms of their assessed performance they need to become “assessment literate” in terms of developing an aligned understanding of assessment standards, criteria, techniques and the relationship of assessment to learning’. This literacy calls not only for an emphasis on explicit knowledge of assessment, but also an intense concentration on tacit knowledge of assessment likely to be constructed in an experiencedbased context of learning in which students are encouraged to participate in the process of assessment and enter the community of practice (Bloxham & West, 2007; O’donovan, Price, & Rust, 2004). This learning environment is highly likely to provide students with a reflective process of learning (Andrews, Brown, & Mesher, 2018) if it is defined and implemented as to foster their active agency.

# 1.1. The significance of student agency

The practice of promoting student active agency in the process of learning is in harmony with the raison d’être of higher education, that is, the promotion of deep learning and lifelong learners (Eison, 1981; Pippin, 2014). It is suggested that assessment practices are to make students self-assessors (Boud, 2000; Nicol, Thomson, & Breslin, 2014) underpinning one of the fundamental principles of assessment for learning (Sambell, McDowell, & Montgomery, 2013). This principle requires students to be active agent of their learning and to make decisions for themselves. They should also be able to decide what approaches to use and assess their own improvement. Moreover, it necessitates opportunities for students to be active participants in assessment processes and foster assessment literacy (Sambell et al., 2013). Hence, this practice challenges the conventional notion that assessment is only within the domain of teachers and underpins the initiatives to design assessment for learning (see, Wiliam, 2011).

This pedagogical idea emphasises learner empowerment thereby engaging them in the processes of ‘co-creation’ that disputes the learning relationships and powers pertaining to it (Ryan & Tilbury, 2013, 5). That is, students’ meaningful participation in the process of learning plausibly improves essential qualities such as ‘trust, risk, interdependence and agency’ which are central to student-teacher relationship (Healey, Flint, & Harrington, 2014). Also, such mutual ownership and decision-making are pedagogically challenging and likely to result in student deep learning (Hubbard et al., 2017). This meaningful participation and engagement in learning and teaching form the building blocks of a pedagogical culture in higher education which could be discussed under the umbrella term ‘partnership’.

# 1.2. Partnership in higher education

Engaging students as partners in learning and teaching in higher education is a multifaceted issue encompassing a vast variety of pedagogical practices (see, Higher Education Academy, 2014). The all-pervasive nature of this practice does not offer a simple and single definition regarding various educational practices in different pedagogical milieus. Nevertheless, the values underpinning the conceptual model of partnership proposed by Higher Education Academy (HEA) are as follows:

• authenticity – all parties have a meaningful rationale for investing in partnership, and are honest about what they can contribute and the parameters of partnership;   
• inclusivity – partnership embraces the different talents, perspectives and experiences that all parties bring, and there are no barriers (structural or cultural) that prevent potential partners getting involved;   
• reciprocity – all parties have an interest in, and stand to benefit from, working and/or learning in partnership;   
• empowerment – power is distributed appropriately and all parties are encouraged to constructively challenge ways of working and learning that may reinforce existing inequalities;   
• trust – all parties take time to get to know each other, engage in open and honest dialogue and are confident they will be treated with respect and fairness;   
• challenge – all parties are encouraged to constructively critique and challenge practices, structures and approaches that undermine partnership, and are enabled to take risks to develop new ways of working and learning;   
• community – all parties feel a sense of belonging and are valued fully for the unique contribution they make;   
• responsibility – all parties share collective responsibility for the aims of the partnership, and individual responsibility for the contribution they make. (HEA, 2014)

Accordingly, student engagement is central to the practice of partnership. It is a process, rather than a product, in which students and staff work and learn together as to foster an authentic engagement in both learning and teaching. Undoubtedly, the extent to which students engage in learning and feel this partnership could be attributed to the particular role they take in their process of learning.

Teaching and assessment are significant areas in which students can act as partners. As for assessment, students participate, for example, in grading practices and peer and self-assessment. This partnership underscores the social situatedness of assessment (Price et al., 2012) which aims at aligning student and assessor understandings of assessment standards, criteria, and qualities and entering students into the community of practice (O’donovan et al., 2004; Smith, Worsfold, Davies, Fisher, & McPhail, 2013), thereby promoting students assessment literacy. The other area in which students act as partners is teaching. Fundamentally, in order for students to take a greater responsibility toward learning, they may act as teachers so as to learn through teaching.

# 1.3. Learning-by-Teaching

Learning-by-teaching (LbT) or peer tutoring activities are variously practiced in higher education (see, Duran, 2016; Topping, 2015). Although the role of students vary based on the different practices that teachers use to implement LbT and on the opportunities with which students are provided to act as teachers, the act of teaching by students is central to LbT. It may be practiced within or between institutions by students of different ages and abilities. Students benefit from a teacherlike role which brings formal academic, social, attitudinal, affective, and cognitive gains (Duran & Topping, 2017).

What Rogers (1969) called experiential learning is theoretically related to LbT. He emphasised the active participation of students in and their direct control over the learning procedure. This self-discovered learning, Rogers asserted, is the only learning which profoundly affects learners’ behaviour. This active role in the process of learning is also emphasised in role-model theory. Role-model theory proposes that the special social roles that learners take form their expectations and hence they become what they are expected to be (Tajfel & Fraser, 1978). When, in LbT for example, a teacher-like role is assigned to students, their peers’ expectations are quite similar to what they expect from a tutor.

Dialogical self theory, which is a more recent concept (see, Hermans, 2012), could be associated with LbT as well. One of its basic tenets is that individuals are constantly engaged in a process of positioning and repositioning their self (Hermans & Hermans-Konopka, 2010). I-position is the central notion of the theory. It emphasises both the unity and multiplicity of the self. The theory suggest that in addition to the central I (internal position), the self assumes external positions and becomes an extended I. ‘The extended I, as contextualized, is never alone but is always together with an actual, remembered, imagined, or anticipated other’ (Hermans, 2012, 9). Being in ever-changing situations, the self experiences various external I-positions and observes them from the outside by an act of self-reflection (Hermans & HermansKonopka, 2010). As for LbT, teaching experience and the role of teacher in a different context is very likely to decentralise I as student and extend it to another I as teacher.

Research shows that students can learn by teaching their peers (Annis, 1983; Fiorella & Mayer, 2013; Roscoe, 2014) and ‘can be effective instructors for one another, even with complex and unfamiliar science content, and that peer tutors can further develop their understanding of the material through teaching’ (Roscoe, 2014, 343). Also, implementing LbT brings about psychological and cognitive benefits for students. For instance, LbT fosters students’ self-monitoring (Roscoe, 2014) and metacognitive regulation (De Backer, Van Keer, & Valcke, 2015) which are central to self-regulated learning (Hadwin, Järvelä, & Miller, 2011). In essence, students’ autonomy and engagement in deeplevel learning is very likely to be promoted through the implementation of LbT in academia and especially in higher education (Arco-Tirado, Fernández-Martín, & Fernández-Balboa, 2011; Wang, 2016).

However, LbT has mostly been employed within higher education as a complementary practice (Duran, 2016). The degree of agency students take in different LbT practices could largely be attributed to the degree and depth of their pedagogical understanding and literacy. Thus, it is fairly reasonable to assume that learning through teaching beyond the academy is likely to increase students’ agency in a greater degree. Moreover, it not only engages students in a deeper learning procedure but also brings them the added advantage of engaging in assessment simultaneously. That is, students experience teaching more independently and thus assume a greater responsibility toward learning. Nevertheless, the considerable uncertainty about the capability of students to act as teachers independently may thwart teachers to provide students with relevant opportunities. The literature (e.g. McKenna & French, 2011), however, shows that teaching can be considered as a part of students’ role.

Moreover, the distinctive feature of LbT, that is, explanation makes it well worthy of attention. In the process of teaching the materials to their peers or other students, tutors are to provide well-organized explanations and deep questioning (Roscoe & Chi, 2008). It thus brings with it a concomitant need for tutors to take a deep cognitive processing and a responsible attitude toward learning. One of the first steps toward demonstrating the importance and benefits of this feature of LbT was taken in a seminal work by Annis (1983). The study compared three groups of students: one which typically studied the material (readonly), one which studied the material in the expectation of teaching it to peers (read-to-teach), and one which studied the material and actually taught it (read-and-teach). It was found that the read-and-teach group improved learning more than the other groups and the read-toteach more than the read-only group.

The other important study by Fiorella and Mayer (2013) met the limitation of Annis’ work (1983) and thus examined the groups in isolation to reduce the impact of students’ interaction on the findings so as to confidently attribute the benefits of teaching to explaining the material per se. It was found that by actual teaching of the content of the lessons, learners acquired a more profound and permanent understanding of the materials. Their findings revealed that LbT feasibly leads to a deep-level learning, a concept proposed by Entwistle (1997) and Marton and Säljö (1997), where learning is more directed toward understanding in contrast to a surface-level learning where learning happens by shallow memorization with a purpose of recall.

Their study also underscores the importance of learning by preparing to teach. By the mere expectation of teaching others, students are spurred to study the materials in a distinctly different way compared to studying in a normal way (e.g. for taking tests). In other words, the cognitive process when students study either in the expectation of teaching the materials or for actual teaching of them is much more beneficial than the cognitive process when they simply study the materials. Hence, learning is principally directed toward understanding.

Collectively, then, in harmony with an important pedagogical culture in higher education (i.e. partnership), LbT, with its various practices, actively engages students in the process of learning and thus promotes their agency. Particularly, providing students with teaching experiences beyond the academy or more independently may bring additional benefits. This is an under-explored area of research deserving special attention in higher education. Previous research has mostly concentrated on the role and benefits of LbT and peer or self-assessment as complementary or intervening practices in students learning and assessment literacy. Participants in the current study had the opportunity to experience teaching and assessment more autonomously. They were thus compared with their counterparts without this experience to explore the role of LbT in their learning and assessment literacy.

# 2. Context and course of the study

As the private language institutes are mushrooming in Iran, students majoring in relevant courses in universities, like participants of the current study, are being provided with favourable opportunities to act as language teachers in these institutes. Initially, applicants teach learners with low levels of proficiency in order to build their confidence and adapt themselves to the environment. Although tutors are provided with previous assessment materials, they are given freedom to develop their own assessment tasks and employ their assessment practices as well. Also, they have the opportunity to discuss teaching issues with other teachers.

# 3. Method

This focus group study aimed at collecting qualitative data by encouraging two groups of students with and without teaching experience to discuss their perceptions of learning, teaching and assessment. The aim was to highlight the differences in their learning approaches and attitudes toward assessment and as a result the role of teaching in these areas. Hence, the focus group method was suitable for the study in that it allows the researchers to collect data from multiple perspectives in a less threatening environment. Moreover, the interaction between participants yields important data, more prompt responses, and plausible solutions (Onwuegbuzie, Dickinson, Leech, & Zoran, 2009). Thus, this method helped the researchers to obtain an in-depth understanding of the perceptions of students with and without teaching experience regarding learning and assessment practices.

# 3.1. Participants

Participants $\left( \mathbf { n } = 3 6 \right)$ ) were undergraduate English students majoring in teaching, translation, and literature courses at Kashmar Higher Education Institute where the researchers taught English courses. Table 1 summarises the composition of the focus groups. Generally, focus groups are consisted of 6–12 participants (Onwuegbuzie et al., 2009). The age range of participants was from 20 to 24 years. One of the two groups of participants $( \mathbf { n } = 1 8 )$ ) in this study had taken the opportunity to teach English to their peers in the language institutes (henceforth referred to as quasi-teachers). All quasi-teachers reported that the reason for engaging in this activity was their interest in teaching. They had between 1 to 2 years teaching experience. Quasiteachers were compared with the other group of participants $( \mathbf { n } = 1 8 )$ ) who had no teaching experience in terms of their perceptions toward learning and assessment.

All participants were studying in the same learning environment and had the same faculty. This was helpful to differentiate their attitudes toward the educational practices. The factors that distinguished the quasi-teachers from the other group were a) their teaching experience, b) the teacher role and c) engagement in assessment practices. Their assessment practices involved the evaluation of all language skills and other relevant skills like vocabulary and grammar learning.

# 4. Procedure

In order to examine if the questions are likely to engage participants and the wordings of them are not ambiguous, individual interviews were conducted with three respondents who did not attend the focus group sessions. Accordingly, only slight changes were made to the wordings of some questions to make them clearer.

Participants were recruited by introducing the purpose of the research in university classes. They were also assured of the voluntary nature of the participation. When willing students approached the research assistant, a suitable time and place for focus group sessions were arranged. In each focus group session, the researchers reintroduced the purpose of the study to participants and ensured the anonymity of participants to help them keep away from personal biases in providing their answers. The participants thus willingly took part in the study. Each focus group interview lasted between $6 0 { - } 7 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ . The semistructured interviews were conducted using participants’ mother tongue (Persian) to put them at ease.

One of the researchers as the moderator was responsible for facilitating the discussion, encouraging the participants to talk, and keeping them focused on the topics. The other researcher as the assistant moderator recorded the interviews and took care of other issues like guiding latecomers, etc. These roles were reversed in other sessions so as to avoid any biases toward the conduction of discussions. Questions were asked to gain participants’ clear perceptions of grading practices, assessment, and their approaches to learning. It is of particular note that questions were formulated in order not to be biased toward certain responses. For example, if quasi-teachers were asked to explain about the effects of teaching on their learning approaches or their attitudes toward learning, their responses might not reasonably be reliable. For this reason, both groups were asked the same and general questions based on the research topics and then further questions were developed to stimulate their thinking as ‘a successful focus group moves beyond answering questions’ (Newby, 2010, 367). Accordingly, whenever, for instance, quasi-teachers indicated a point relevant to their teaching experience, they were asked to elaborate on their responses. Examples of opening questions are as follows: a) what strategies do you use to study the courses and learn the materials? b) What teaching methods/ strategies did you find helpful in improving your learning? c) What do you think about the way your performances are evaluated? d) In what ways can exams help you learn the materials?

# 4.1. Data analysis

An emergent-systematic focus group design was used to analyse the data (see, Onwuegbuzie et al., 2009). The data were transcribed verbatim as to facilitate their analysis. The first round of reading the transcriptions was only for the researchers to become familiar with the dataset. However, the researchers made initial coding and annotations if deemed necessary.

Repeated reading of data is emphasised to facilitate the coding of them which is an iterative process in nature (Newby, 2010). Further reading of the data was done as to identify similar and different units of meaning. Then, each meaningful unit of data was tagged regarding the research aims and topics. While tagging and naming the codes, the researchers constantly referred to the literature for obtaining relevant information. For example, Wrightös research (2012) on educational orientation of students helped the researchers define the theme ‘strategic learning’. ‘Grade conversation’ was one of the codes which was derived from quasi-teachers group responses and was not observed in the student group script. Other examples of the initial codes were ‘the need for explanation’ identified in quasi-teachers’ accounts which led to the sub-theme ‘learning by explaining’ and ‘the need for regular quizzes’ in the responses provided by the student group related to the theme ‘assessment preference’.

This initial list of codes was analysed in two sessions with two other experts. In the first session, this analysis was carried out for indentifying new potential codes, their validity, and constructing the themes. The second session was held as to discuss the generated themes and finalise them. These sessions helped the researchers gain confidence about their interpretations and ensure the credibility of the results.

# 5. Findings

Focus group interviews with student group revealed two main themes namely assessment preference and teaching elements and two subthemes for the second one namely graded learning and choice of assessment. As for the quasi-teacher group, reflection was identified as one of the main themes with assessment as feedback and assessment preference as its sub-themes. Deep learning was the other main them for this group with strategic learning, ungraded learning, and learning by explaining as its subthemes.

# 6. Data from student group

# 6.1. Assessment preference

Participants from student group discussed their assessment preferences which believed to have effects on their learning. Formative assessment was generally found to be more indicative of students’ performance in comparison to summative assessment. Students reported that they had more time and opportunity to study during the term: ‘I may face any problem at the end of the term for taking final exams the way I wish to do. So, I think my performances during the term should be counted more’ (F1, P1). Participants argued that oneshot evaluations could not solely assess their performance. Emphasis was placed on the quizzes to be taken over the term: ‘if tutors put more emphasis on the assignment and regular quizzes during the term, we’d better learn the materials’ (F2, P3).

Students also argued that

Some of my classmates are good at memorising the information because they have a better short-term memory. So, even though they don’t study during the term, they get a good mark for final exams. I don’t honestly get motivated to study during the term. This isn’t learning. I forget the information after the final exam. (F2, P5)

Generally, although these students believed that grades could not reflect real learning, they showed an overwhelming need for grade achievement and an orientation toward summative assessment.

# 6.2. Teaching elements

This main theme refers to teaching approaches and the particular teaching practices and strategies implemented by tutors. These practices are highly significant due to their effects on students’ learning attitude and behavior and their approaches toward learning in particular. Two subthemes have been emerged from this main theme.

# 6.2.1. Graded learning

Students regarded grades as the main purpose of assessment. Their concern to be taught about the graded materials only could be linked to their focus on marks over learning.

Participants in this group appreciated the tutors who emphasised and worked on the information which was graded in the final exam: ‘some tutors teach us what is only appeared in the exams. This way we have enough time to study’ (F2, P2).

Students argued that some tutors were inclined to work on the whole coursebook while it seemed unnecessary: ‘I felt forced to learn my whole coursebook. Some information was missed and the tutor asked us to go and learn it on our own. It was quite stressful’ (F2, P6).

This may be indicative of students’ dependency on their teachers and their unwillingness to do optional reading. Accordingly, students’ emphasis on teaching the graded materials could be attributed to their orientation toward grades.

# 6.2.2. Choice of assessment

Giving a choice of assessment to students may encourage them to engage in the learning process. Students appreciated and valued this: ‘when the tutor asked our opinions for the type of assessment, I felt respectful. I expressed myself and there were useful discussions on problems and workload’ (F2, P6).

Moreover, participants argued about the incongruity between the type of assessment and the objectives of coursbooks:

We had to learn a bunch of English phrases for this course. It was really stressful, you know, I felt forced to learn them by heart. It’d be better to learn them gradually. I wish I could take the exam in a different way for this course. (F1, P4)

The above quote indicates the importance of assessment choice regarding students’ learning. Accordingly, assessment can be more aligned with learning if for which students are given a choice and are involved in relevant decision making.

# 7. Data from quasi-teachers group

# 7.1. Reflection

Reflection is an all-pervasive concept which could be traced in a variety of educational practices. Importantly, it is more likely to be understood and conceptualized in experienced-based pedagogical practices. Quasi-teachers frequently reported that teaching engaged them in a reflective process of learning. That is, preparing for teaching the materials helped them to gain a deeper understanding of their own process of learning. Significantly, quasi-teachers’ attitude toward and understanding of learning and assessment in university developed from their experience of teaching in the language institutes. Assessment preference and assessment as feedback were identified as subthemes within this main theme.

# 7.1.1. Assessment preference

Quasi-teachers valued their active engagement in assessment practices by means of teaching. They, too, emphasised the implementation of formative assessment for evaluating students’ performance:

The final exam shouldn’t be the only criterion for evaluation. Students who are active during the term should be credited. I think tutors should give marks for different activities during the term and count them in their final evaluation. (F4, P2)

Quasi-teachers believed that concentration on final exams may undermine process-based learning. Hence, referring to their assessment experience in the language institutes, they put emphasis on constant evaluation during the term in addition to final examinations. The suggested type of assessment by quasi-teachers was a mix of formative and summative assessment with an emphasis on the former. They also highlighted the need for aligning assessment with the course objectives and students’ individuality and needs:

I have to assess all four skills of English in my classes. So, for each skill I may use a different type of assessment … and I consider what is essential for students to learn in the exams. (F6, P5)

It should be mentioned that quasi-teachers mostly made comparisons with and reported on the assessments used in their own classes. It was rather a pedagogical reflection observed in their reports during the interviews. Generally, they showed a broader understanding of assessment and grading practices in comparison to their counterparts.

# 7.1.2. Assessment as feedback

Emphasis was placed on analysing students’ performance on tests to be used as feedback for the purpose of improving their learning. Quasiteachers highlighted the need for particular classes in which the teacher generally analyses the problems students have faced in their test performance:

It’s not necessary to separately work on each paper or performance. After each test, common mistakes or the areas students have problem in could be identified and worked on in a particular session. This is what we do in the institute. But I think it’s not possible in our university … maybe because of the lack of time or something. (F6, P2)

This was perceived as the primary purpose of assessment by quasiteachers. That is, in addition to evaluation, assessment is to improve student learning. Quasi-teachers valued this practice because it helps to clear expectations and reduce student assessment anxiety. However, they did not clearly explain the reason why it is not practiced in the university.

# 7.2. Deep learning

Quasi-teachers emphasiesd and appreciated a deep approach toward leaning. This was identified through their arguments about strategic learning, emphasis on ungraded learning and learning by explaining. These subthemes show that quasi-teachers valued and engaged in deep learning and de-emphasised mere grade achievement.

# 7.2.1. Strategic learning

Strategic learning refers to the students’ use of manipulative tactics for their achievement in general. Quasi-teachers argued about the decisive role of grades in assessment practices considering that they could be obtained strategically:

… in my idea, grades shouldn’t be emphasised … at the end of the term, most of the students study previous tests and usually get a good mark … it is something that should be avoided early in previous stages. Grades have always been there … always important. (F4, P6)

Moreover, grade conversations were also regarded as a type of strategic learning. These conversations are taken place for the purpose of improving grades or knowledge and learning based on students’ learning approaches (Wright, 2012). Quasi-teachers argued about student-tutor conversations about grades and emphasised their impact on achieving grades:

… they told me about their conversations with tutors to receive better marks … I saw my classmates talked the tutors into giving them better grades. They tried to make the tutors feel good about them though they weren’t pleased with them. (F5, P1)

Quasi-teachers’ lamentation about strategic learning could be indicative of their concern about learning and grades at the same time. However, their dissenting views of this practice could be attributed to their dominant orientation toward learning.

# 7.2.2. Ungraded learning

Optional reading by students is considered a learning-oriented characteristic. It is done for the purpose of acquiring a deeper understanding of the materials. Grade-oriented students may not be inclined to do optional reading if it is not graded. The following quote illustrates the point

At the beginning of the term I was interested in writing term papers and spent a good time on it. So I had to study a lot of resources in addition to university couesebooks. But it took time and I lost marks for other assignments … I actually lost my motivation for doing it. I had to forgo its pleasure for getting marks. (F5, P2)

Relatedly, quasi-teachers appreciated the freedom to choose the alternative types of assignment suggested by their tutors:

… one of our tutors gave us the freedom to select the assignment we were interested in. I could choose to write a term paper on the material instead of working on the coursebook and studying it for the final exam. I was enthusiastic about it. (F6, P1)

The emphasis put on optional reading and alternative types of assignment especially term papers by quasi-teachers demonstrate their concentration on learning over marks. It can also be implied from their accounts that unless teachers emphasise optional reading, writing term papers, and other relevant learning-oriented activities students may not be encouraged to engage in such practices.

# 7.2.3. Learning by explaining

Quasi-teachers frequently reported that providing their students with well-structured explanations in the process of teaching helped them learn deeper: ‘I never forget what I teach. While teaching, for example, I sometimes understand a point of grammar that I couldn’t have fully grasped it before’ (F4, P4).

It was also reported that such a deep understanding was the result of quality questions: ‘When preparing for teaching I asked myself the questions I might be asked in the classroom. Difficult questions, you know. When discussing them with my classmates or tutors, I learned new information’ (F4, P3).

Reflecting on this experience, they believed that explaining the materials substantially help them better learn their university courses as well: ‘teaching led me to always think if I’m able to explain what I’m studying. I try to learn the courses this way and it really helps me understand them’ (F6, P2). Generally, their reports highlighted the significant difference between knowledge delivery and knowledge construction and the positive effects of the latter on students learning approaches. Table 2 summarises the findings and they are discussed in relation to previous research in the following section.

# 8. Discussion

Using focus-group interviews, this study compared the students acting as language teachers with their counterparts who had no teaching experience. The results show differences in their approaches to learning and perceptions toward assessment. Collectively, in comparison to students, quasi-teachers showed a broader knowledge about grading and assessment practices by reflecting on their LbT experience. Although both groups preferred formative assessment for evaluating their performance, quasi-teachers, unlike students, were less concerned with grades, valued ungraded learning and devalued strategic learning. Also, quasi-teachers and students appreciated choice of assignment and assessment respectively which plays a significant role in their performance (Craddock & Mathias, 2009), makes them creative, and plausibly reduces their workload (Lynam & Cachia, 2017).

As the literature also suggests (e.g. Andrews et al., 2018; Trowler, 2010), active participation and partnership encourage students to reflect on their process of learning and promote their assessment literacy. Quasi-teachers in this study too believed that teaching brings about a reflective process of learning. Fundamentally, teaching experience provided them with additional benefits to look at assessment practices from a quite pedagogical lens. This was apparently due to their active engagement in assessment during the process of tutoring other students. For instance, they emphasised that assessment could be regarded as feedback in order to improve learning. That is, analysing students’ test performance and addressing their relevant problems in regular sessions were considered fruitful practices to improve learning. This practice is similar to the use of exemplars (anonymised pieces of work or tests previously done by other students) which provides students with direct experience of the assessment procedure (Sadler, 2009; Smith et al., 2013) and the transparency of assessment practices (Hawe & Dixon, 2016).

On the other hand, student without LbT experience appreciated the tutors who mainly focused on the information appeared in final examinations. Although they valued the process-oriented evaluation, they also showed a greater concern for marks over learning. This could be the reason why they emphasised graded learning in contrast to ungraded learning reported by quasi-teachers. Most importantly, students made no references to optional reading and writing term papers valued by quasi-teachers. Moreover, quasi-teachers depreciated strategic learning which is associated with students’ conversation with tutors for the purpose of improving poor grades (Wright, 2012). Wright (2012) found that grade-oriented students engage in the efforts to affect their tutors’ behavior for increasing disappointing grades. This issue emerging from the findings is specifically related to educational orientation of students (see, Pollio & Beck, 2000) which could serve as a base for future studies.

Accordingly, it seems reasonable to deduce that assessment literacy and deep learning are the likely outcomes of LbT which is the result of active participation of students in assessment, teaching, and as a result learning. In their important study, Price et al. (2012) identified the competencies contributing to assessment literacy. These competencies range from simple to higher level assessment skills. For example, understanding assessment terminologies is regarded as a simple attribute. In contrast, the higher level sets of skills which are challenging are likely to be developed by the activities where students act as an assessor (Boud et al., 2016; Nicol et al., 2014). It is fairly reasonable to provide additional support for these findings in the current study. Interestingly, there were students majoring in teaching in both groups. However, only quasi-teachers who had practically experienced teaching, unlike their counterparts, showed a reflective attitude toward assessment practices.

Such an active participation for improving assessment literacy has also been suggested in previous research (Bloxham & West, 2007; Oödonovan et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2013). However, it is of note that experiencing an active agency beyond the academy was to the benefit of quasi-teachers in this study. This agency seemingly promoted a more pedagogical attitude toward learning and assessment in quasi-teachers. The researchers are mindful that the claims we can make from the data in this study are quite modest. Nevertheless, we believe they shed more light on the issue and provide a bigger picture. Such an agency is very likely to help students promote a sense of collective responsibility, acquire more autonomy, and feel more attachment to the community. Also, it is in harmony with a pedagogical culture in higher education, that is, partnership which stresses students’ participation in both learning and teaching (HEA, 2014).

As for deep learning, this paper concentrates on and emphasises, first, the distinctive feature of LbT (i.e. explanation) and, second, the fruitful cognitive process inherent in this activity (i.e. deep cognitive processing due to either the expectation of teaching or actual teaching of the materials) which makes it well worthy of attention. The cognitive process which learners take in LbT is potentially constructive, whether in or out of the classroom, in that it is formulated in a context to which explaining, interacting, questioning, responding, and giving feedback are integral. This fruitful context of learning is very likely to promote learners’ self-monitoring and knowledge-building strategies (Chi, 2009; Roscoe & Chi, 2008; Roscoe, 2014). This was explicitly reported by quasi-teachers in this study. They stated that explaining the materials and asking oneself quality questions when studying lead to acquiring deeper knowledge.

These intrinsic merits of LbT plausibly promote students’ responsible attitude toward learning in order not to consider it accomplished by passing tests and receiving required grades. It is rather regarded as an ongoing meaningful process which necessitates construction of knowledge by cooperation and collaboration with others as members of a community. Specifically, based on the results of the current study, taking the role of a teacher, the challenging task of teaching and its cognitive requirements, and active participation in assessment are the primary causes of the most significant outcomes of LbT, that is, assessment literacy and deep learning. Accordingly, by implementing LbT in higher education, in contrast to their passive role as a knowledge-deliverer, students are encouraged to take an active role as a quasi-teacher which helps them refine their grasp of the learning process and take a deep approach toward learning.

The researchers believe that the findings can be generalized to other contexts of learning as well. Although the participants were English language learners, students majoring in other fields of study too can be provided with similar opportunities to act as teachers independently. Moreover, the findings add to our understanding of the conception of teaching and learning in the Knowledge Society emphasising that ‘teaching will have to be democratised and we are all going to need to teach, as well as learn. Or, better still, to learn by teaching’ (Duran, 2016, 5).

# 9. Limitations of the study

First, although every attempt was made to make the research questions clear and remove the irrelevant responses which did not correspond with the research topics, there is a possibility that participants’ responses might have been arisen from other variables such as their teachers’ approaches and attitudes to teaching, learning and assessment and the broader context of assessment including assessment policies of educational systems. Moreover, LbT is a multidimensional issue encompassing a variety of practices. Hence, for instance, it might be beneficial if future research quantitatively investigates educational orientation of students referred to as students’ attitude and behaviour toward learning and grades (see, Pollio & Beck, 2000) in relevant studies. In this regard, mixed-method studies could serve the purpose.

Second, as the focus of this study was on students’ perception, there is some likelihood that more light would have been thrown on the issue if the focus had been on faculties’ perceptions as well. This is also a limitation which could be addressed in future research.

# 10. Conclusion

Assessment literacy ‘can be gained by active involvement in an educational community in which students are contributing partners’ (HEA, 2012, 21). Students may act as teachers to feel a deep attachment to their community of practice. While learning by teaching, students are also involved in assessment practices and are likely to foster their assessment literacy. Also, LbT encourages students to take a deep approach toward learning and construct the knowledge they obtain in university.

Significantly, this research highlights the benefits of LbT brought to students when they experience it more autonomously. The upshot of this is the possibility that students develop a wider pedagogical perspective particularly due to the teacher-like role they take, its cognitive requirements, and engagement in assessment practices. Moreover, they experience a reflective process of learning through experiencing a teaching and learning environment simultaneously. This way, LbT asks students to put on the eyeglasses of a teacher and get inside the process of learning. They then learn how to learn and become autonomous learners. In essence, their sense of being as lifelong learners is likely to be developed from the belief that “I explain, therefore I learn”.
