Structuring an introduction and literature review (henceforth litrature review) for an empirical study in a way that justifies the study, while smmarizing prior related rearch, is a omplex and importat killfor scolars. Thus, it i not surprising that a great deal of research on academic writing has focused on the literatre review. While some reearch has focused on specific felds ., Khaw & Tan, 2018; Kuteea & McGrath, 2015), much rearch has ben comparative. Studie of literature reviews may detail how they differ in structre cros fields (., Lim, 2010) or languages (eg, oi, 2010). In addition, some rearch has foused on writers development in producing the genre (e.g., Chen & Li, 2019). Other research has taken a lexical approach by focusing on lexical bundles or phrase-frames in literature reviews (e.g., Lu et al., 2018), and some focused on more global issues, such as citation use (e.g., Hu & Wang, 2014). Often, studies of linguistic features also include an analysis of rhetorical moves. For example, Cortes (2013) quantified lexical bunde according to which rhetorical moves they appeared in, and Lu e al. (2021) described the relationship between syntactic complexity and rhetorical moves. Such an approach has been advocated by Moreno and Swales (2018), who note that these types of analyses bridge the form-function gap.

The dominant model for describing rhetorical moves in literature reviews has been the Create a Research Space or CARS model (Swales, 1990, 2004) associatd with what has een called the English for specific purpose approach to gere analysis The affordance of this text-ased approach is that it alows for the coding of lrge dat setsto use in quantitativeanalyses. Our current comparative study also uses the CARs model, in conjunction with a lexical analysis, in a unique way, namely to illstrate how theories are used in quantitative versus qualitative applied inguisics research. We review here three topics: (1) characterizations of the role of theory in quantitative and qualitative research; (2) corpus-based studies of quantitative and qualitative research; and (3) recent applications of the CARS model in empirical studies. In bringing together these areas, we discuss why a closer examination of literature reviews is needed with regard to the role of theory in justifying research across paradigms.

# 1. Literature review

# 1.1. Characterizations of theory in quantitative and qualitative research

The role of theory in empirical research is not a new topic, yet its relevance and importance continue to be discussed. Recently organizational psychologists Aguinis and Cronin (2022) claimed that \*the number one and most important reason why research is meaningful and makes a useful and valuable contribution is theory (p. 1). They charactrized theory as \*essentiall just a fancy word for Do we understand whatsgoing on?" (p. 2). Despite the importance f theory, Aguinis and Cronin noted that there are times when theories may not be needed. In second language acquisition (SLA), VanPatten et al. (2020) described theories as statements that explain the why of natural phenomena. VanPatten et al. also acknowledge that not everyone believes that SLA research nees to be theory driven, and we agre that there is no consensus on the role of theory in research on language learning and teaching. onversely, Aguinis and Cronin (2022) clamed that in organizational psychology, a study that does not contribute to theory is unlikely to be published. Given that Gao et al. (2022) found that in articles published between 2013 and 2019 in top applied linguistics journals, $3 8 \%$ of quantitative studies and $2 3 \%$ of qualitative studies did not mention theory, this characterization of the role of theory may not be true across academic fields.

Regarding paradigmatic differences, scholars have addressed the role of theory to some extent, for example, in relation to forming research questions. A recent attempt by Creswell and Creswell (2018) explained, citing Kerlinger (1979), that theories are used in quantitative research to test hypotheses and examine the relationship among variables. In qualitative research, theories are used as a broad explanation for behaviors and attitudes and as a lens that \*shapes the types of questions asked, informs how data are collected and analyzed, and provides a call for action or change." (p. 108).

Within applied linguistics, claims have been made of paradigmatic ifferences. They differ, however, in nature and have changed over the years. For example, some researchers have claimed that unlike quantitative research, qualitative research can generate hypotheses without being rooted in theory (Brown, 2014; van Lier, 1994), yet Davies (1995) holds an opposing view. Others have lamented that quantitative research is not rooted strongly enough in theory (Gregg, 1989, 1993; Long, 2007). Meanwhile, several scholars from both paradigms have proclaimed the necessty of theory including VanPatten et al. (2020) and Collins and Stockton (2018) for quanitative and qualitative rerch, rectively. It sems, then, that cll for atntionto thry ave ired, but as reported in Gao et al. (2022), they have been only partially heeded.

The aforementioned charactrizations are not inappropriate, but we know of very littl research on the role of theory that has taken a discursive approach by examining published studies to illstrate the framing of research. Because paradigmatic discussions of how quantitative and qualitative research differ abound in research methods books, we belie that it is important to verify such claims through an empirical investigation.

# 1.2. Corpus-based studies of quantitative and qualitative research

Despite alarge amount of comparative research on research artices, surprisingly, les research has been devoted to variation across research paradigms, specifically quantitative versus qualitative research. Although none of these studies, apart from Gaoet a. (2022), discussed the role of theories, research has illstrated that corpus-based approaches reveal how language expresses epistemological differences in the two approaches.

Candarli and Jones (2019) examined lexical bundles acros the two research paradigms in the field of education. With regard to the function of the undes, the thre types they idntified wre l mre common in quanttive rearch: reertil , are preented in table), stance (e.g., it could be argued), and discourse organizers (e.g., on the other hand). In addition, Candarli and Jones were able to identify bundes that were more distinctive in each type of research. For example, was found to be was more distinctive in quantitative research while to make sense of was more distinctive in qualitative research. Through this corpus-based analysis, they were able to draw conclusions about the nature of the two paradigms as expressed through the language used in research articles.

Similarly, Cao and Hu (2014) examined interactional metadiscourse expressions in the discussion sections of articles in thre fields They found several types of interactional metadiscourse that were more common in quantitative research, while none were more common in qualitative research. They concluded that this was because the expressions (e.g., in other words, in the next section) helped show causality and links among variables, noting that there was les need in qualitative research to use such comparativetransitions. As compared with qualitative studies, both Cao and Hu (2014) and Candarli and Jones (2019) suggest that quantitative reearch draws on more formulaic language, suggesting, perhaps, that the structure of research in this paradigm is more uniform across studies.

Using a multi-dimensional analysis, Gray (2013) examined research articles for diffrences across fields and paradigms. This approach, established by Biber (1988) and colleagues, considers how linguistic and lexical features group together to form different compositional dimensions. Gray was able to show how quantitative and qualitative research articles differed across several dimensions. For example, for applied linguistics artice, qualitative articles were more narrative and human-focused while quantitative articles were more procedural and non-human focused. This is not surprising, but Gray showed how these characterizations were expressed through linguistic forms.

Focusing on the role of theories, Gao et al. (2022) were interested in how theories played a role in quantitative and qualitative applied inguisics research. Gaoet al. (2022) analyzed how frequently the lemma theor- was used and how it collocated with other lexical items. They found that theor- was used more often in qualitative studies. Furthermore, collocations revealed that theories in quantitative research were ofte hypothetical in nature and meant to be tested and confirmed whereas in qualitative research, theories were used as heurisics that guided research. Gao et al. (2022) were motivated by characterizations of quantitative and qualitative inquiry that appeared in various research methods books, presumably not based on empirical evidence. Their findings did not delve into how theory as represented by the lemma theor-) was used in relation to the various rhetorical moves found in literature reviews, the focus of this study.

# 1.3. Recent applications of the CARS model

There are diffrent versions of the CARS model (Swales, 1990, 2004; Swales & Feak, 2012), but most studies draw on Swales (2004), also used in our study. The CARS model posits that scholars use three basic rhetorical moves to frame litrature reviews: establishing a territory, establishing a niche, and presenting the present work (Swale, 2004). The first move is self-contained and is made to both establish relevance and synthesize previous research. The ltter two contain substeps that first identify gaps in research and then state how the study will resolve these gaps. Swales's model is presented in Table 1 with examples from the current study. Although the univerality and certain methodological isues have been debated (e.g., Kuteeva & McGrath, 2015 and Polio & Friedman, 2017, respectively), the model's use as heuristic remains steady. We cannot summarize all reearch here, but ntead, fous on a few studies whose application of the model is somewhat related to our use of the CARS model.

Similar to our study, Kwan et al. (2012) examined literature reviews in two research paradigms in the field of information systems, namely, behavioral science research and design science research. Their research question specifically concerned the paradigmatic differences in how previous reearch is evaluated. Thus, they identified specific strategies (not normally included as steps in the CARS model) within the three main moves that related to ealuating previous work. While there are not clear paralls in the two paradigms from information systems to the quantitative-qualitative divide, Kwan et al. showed that the two paradigms used different strategies within the three main moves.

Le and Harrington (2015) examined the moves in the discussion sections of quantitative applied inguistics articles, an under. studied section of research artice s compared to iterature reviews, as they note. They explained that in discusson sections, the researcher presents to the reader the meaning of the quantitative findings and shows how thir study contributes totheory and practice in the discipline emphasis aded, p. 46). They identified key word i.., words stinct to the diussion section as well s clusters i. e., lexical bundles) and related them to the specific steps from the discussion sections. Interestingly, despite their clam that the discussion sections were used to advance theory, theor- was not found in any of the key words or lexical bundes. This lack of theor- use suggests that thery may more likely be addresse in literature reviews (of quantitative applied inguistic articles) than in discussion sections.

Note. Uses of theor- from our data are italicized throughout.

Lu et al. (2020) examined the relationship between syntacticll complex sentences and rhetorical functions, but before doing so, they modified Swales's (2004) model to include aditional stes found in the literature reviews of some field. Of particular relevance to our study, Lu et al. added astep to move 3 called advancing theoretical clams," noting, in another tudy, In] some disciplines (e. g., economics and political science), it was fairly common for an RA [rearch article] to propose a new theory or model as its main objective and to elaborate on the main claims or hypotheses of that theory or model in the introduction .." (Lu et al., 2021, p.66). Using pre-identified measures of complexity and two types of analyses, they found that sentences in this move (among others) contained more inite deendent clauses and reached a set threshold level of nominalizations. Lu et al. (2021) also examined social cience literature reviews from several fields by first coding the rhetorical moves and then determining the phrase-frames that were used to express the rhetorical functions. However, the term theor- was not found in any of the phrase-frames including those found in "advancing theoretical claims." Although we did not use this model in our analysis, we return to it in other sections of this paper.

As a whole, the aforementioned studies illstrate how rhetorical moves are expressed through lexical bundles and phrase-frames, keywords, and syntactic complexity, thus bridging what Moreno and Swales (2018) called the form-function gap. Taking the above research together, we believe that hetorical moves approach provides useful framework for our analysis of how reearchers refer to theories in situating and justifying research in literature reviews.

# 2. Focus of current study

This study compares the literature reviews of quantitative and qualitative empirical articles in applied linguistics, or more specifically, studies on second language larning and teaching. While we acknowledge the narrow focus on our own field, we also believe that the balance of both researchtraditions makes applied linguistics an ideal field for which to compare quantitative and qualitative literature reviews. In additio, many journals in the field publish both types of reearch, so we can to some xtent, keep the publication venues constant. Our research question is How is the lemma theor- used in the rhetorical moves of literature reviews in quantitative and qualitative studies on second language learning and teaching?

By starting with the lemma theor- and identifying the rhetorical moves in the literature reviews, we are using what Lu et al. (2021) and others calla form-first approach. In this approach, for example, one begins by identifying a word, bundle, or structure and identifying the associated moves (e.g., Cortes, 2013). Converely, one can identify the moves and then determine the assciated language (e.g., Lu et a., 2021). Given our research question, a form-first aproach was appropriate because we wanted to identify which moves invoked theory.

# 3. Method

# 3.1. Corpus compilation and data preparation

The current study is part of a larger corpus-based project on the genre analysis of published quantitative and qualitative reearch on second language leaning and teaching (Gaoet al., 2022). In the firs of this multiple-article study, we selected four top-tier journals that published empirical studies on L2 learning and teaching as the source of our corpus: Applied Linguistics [AL], Jounal of Second Language Writing [JSLW], Modern Language Jounal [MLJ], and TESOL Quarterly [TQ]. We set the scope of the article search for 2013-2019 with articles from 2020 added for this current study.

Our rationale for corpus criteria was as follows. First, we limited our article search to the leading journals because we believe the leading journals represent exemplary language use, regardles of author background. A second, important criterion was whether the journals published quantitative and qualitative research in a relatively balanced manner, because we needed to ensure our findings about the impact of research type were not confounded by the publication preferences of journals. For example, we did not include Studies in Second Language Acquisition or Language Learning because quantitative studies represented $9 0 \%$ and $1 0 0 \%$ of the empirical studies published in the journals in 2019, respectively. In the end, the journals we selected reresented four out of the top 12 journals in linguistics at the time of data collection. (See S1 in the supplemental materials.)

Third, we set the starting point of our article search at 2013 because this period was marked by increasing methodological awareness in the field of L2 learning and teaching. The increasing awarenessis reflected by (1) the compilation of multiple special issues on methodology by leading journals(e.g, Applied Linguistics, Language Learning, and TEsoL Quarterly), (2) the updating of guidelines for journal submission (e.g., Mahboob et al., 2016; Norris et al., 2015), (3) the publishing of numerous handbooks of research methods, methodological meta-analyses, and research syntheses (e.g, Brown, 2014; Phakiti et al., 2018; Plonsky, 2014, 2015), and (4) the regular hosting of conference colloquia and pre-conference workshops dedicated to methodological discussions (e. g., Hulstijn et l., 2014). Of course, methodology was discused prior to 2013, but we believed that research trends would be more likely revealed in an era of more systematic discussion.

After identifying al the fll-length articles published by the four leading journals between 2013 and 2020, two of the researchers read through the articles independently to exclude the non-empirical studies. Specificlly, we defined empirical articles as those characterized by systematic collection and analysis of data, while excluding all artice that did not present new data, including position papers and descriptions of personal experience and educational policy. We also excluded allrearch syntheses except for metaanalyses, which were kept as examples of quantitative research.

We then removed the empirical studies without an explicit focus on second language learning or teaching, such as those on language policy. We coded the remaining articles according to their methodologies (quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-methods) following the practices and definitions in Creswell (2013), olin-Kies (2014), and Hening (1986). Specifical, we coded quantitative studie as those predominantly involving the tallying, manipulation, or sstematic aggregation of quantities of data" (enning, 1986, p. 702), while categorizing qualitative studies as those predominantly consisting of text analysis, thnography and case studies, narraive acounts, verbal report, and conversation analysis. Regarding corpus-based studies and discourse analyses, we followed Gollin-Kies's (2014) practice by coding those that were numericll based as quantitative, while coding the rest qualitative. Lastly, we followed Creswells (2013) definition i categorizing mixed-methods studies as those in which the investigator \*collects and analyzes data, integrates the findings, and draws inferences using both quantitative and qualitative approaches or methods in a single study or program of inquiry" (p. 4). Allthe ambiguous cases were coded other. To ensure inter-rater reliability, the rearchers first coded the studies independently and then compared their results. The initial inter-rater agreement was 89.86 per cent. Problematic cases were discussed in team meetins unil ll thre reearcher reached 100 per cent agrement. At the end of this step, ll the mixed-methods and ambiguous cases were removed. Table 2 summarizes the procedure and Table 3 provides the final number of articles used in our analysis.

After the articles were selected and classfied, the researchers cleaned the data. Only the introduction and the literature review sections were extracted on the grounds that we aimed to explore the functional role f theories in creating a research space (Swales, 1990, 2004) in quantitative and qualitative L2 research. We did not, for example, extract the methods sections, not because theories played a lesser role there, but because methods sections focus on the studies per se and thus are essrelevant to our resarch objective. For subsequent data analysis, allthe files were automatically converted into plain text files and all the paragraph headings, graphs, tables, and figures were removed. The data cleaning resulted in a 1,561,252-token corpus with two subcorpora (qualitative: 659,577 tokens; quantitative: 901,675 tokens).

# 3.2. Data analysis

To compare the functions of theories in quantitative and qualitative L2 research, we coded the rhetorical functions of all the sentences containing the 1904 uses of theor- found in the corpus.' This included 1030 uses from 237 qualitative studies $( 7 7 \%$ of the qualitative studies) and 874 uses from 222 quantitative studies ( $6 1 \%$ of the quantitative studies). They were coded according to Swales's (2004) revised CARS model. The sentences were examined in context, and any sentence containing more than one use of theor- was counted more than once. In addition, because this currnt study, as opposed to Gao et al. (2022), examined every use of theor- and not only the collocations of the most used forms, we were able to make additional observations. For example, we noted any negative uses of theor- that may suggest a study is atheoretical, and examined the verb form, theorize, which appeared to infrequently for a collocational analysis in Gao et al. (2022).

We developed coding guidelines based on a random sample of the first batch of data (2013-2019) and used the same guidelines to code the remaining data in the frst and the later batch (from 2020). The specific procedures were as follows. We extracted 1641 theorconcordances (qualitative: 867; quantitive: 77) from our first batch of data using AntConc (Anthony, 2019), and then randomly extracted $2 0 \%$ of the concordances as pilot data (qualitative: 175; quantitative: 154). Second, two of the researchers coded the pilot data based on Swales's (2004) revised CARS model. Ambiguous cases were discussed at team meetings until ll three team members reached $1 0 0 \%$ agreement on the coding results. At the end of this step, we formulated coding guidelines with specifications and examples (see S2 in the supplemental materials). Finall, two researchers coded the remaining theor- concordances. The oeral inter-rater agrement was 81.64 per cent (1285 ut of 1574sentences). Disagreements were discussed at team meetings until there was 100 percent agreement, with one ambiguous sentence removed from the final data set. Examples of each of the functions are provided in Table 1.

We did not use Lu et al.'s (2020) model because we were concerned that the increased number of steps would have resulted in steps that were to infrequent to analyze, but afer the quantitative analysis, we re-examined al of the sentences in move 3 to determine if any might fall under the new ste, advancing thoretical claims, since such a step is important to the focus of this study. Two of the researchers read through all the Move-3 segments and independently identified those that proposed a new theory or model or elaborated on the main claims or hypotheses of the theory or model in the introduction. Ambiguous cases were iscussed in team meetings until agreement was reached. Because this analysis was exploratory, we did not analyze the findings quantitatively.

After the coding was completed, we performed multilevel multinomial logistic modeling on the functional coding (i.e, the moves and steps) of the 1903 uses of theor-. This method provides robust analys of nested, discrt choice data (Griffiths et al. 2002) and was therefore appropriate for our corpus where theor- uses were nested consecutively in the artces, ournals, and by authors (i.e, the same article could contain multiple intances of theor, the same journal could publish multiple article, and the same author could contribute to multiple journals). We included the functional coding of each use of theor- as the outcome, with Move 1 as the baseline category. That is, we estimated the odds of using theor- for allthe other moves and steps relative to those of using theor- for Move 1. Research Type was the only fied efect (i.e, the parameter we amed to consider, with the Quantitative as the baseline. o determine the random effts (., thoseariables tht ma hae hd an effet bu tht coud nt be sstmatically exmid, such s Athor, we followed aseries of model-building strategies which are specified in the results section. Goodnessof fit of the models was asssed based on negative $2 \log$ likelihood (-2LL) tests using the Chi-squared statistics (McIntosh, 2012). We also considered the variance accounted for by the random effect to determine the null model.

In our corpus, $6 9 . 2 8 \%$ of the qualitative studies (212 out of 306) used theor- 717 times to establish a territory (Move 1), while $5 4 . 5 7 \%$ of the quantitative studies (197 out of 361) used theor- 670 times for the same purpose. Because Move 1 was set as the baseline and hence was not examined in the multilevel multinomial logistic modeling analysis, we conducted an aditional mixed-efects ogistic regression analysis on the Move 1 data, to explore whether quantitative and qualitative research differed in using theory to establish the territory. For the response variable, we coded each study binaril as either using or not using theor- for Move 1. Research Type was the only fixd effect, with th gartms of th lenh of the articles as the offe as ther- is more likely occur in longr articles). To determine which random effects to include in the null model, we followed similar model-building procedures as in the multilevel multinomial logistic modeling analysis. In the end, none of the random-effects models converged. As a result, we conducted a logistic regression using the glm function of the stats package v. 4.1.0 (R core team, 2021). Model fit was assessed with -2L tests using the Chi-squared statistics (McIntosh, 2012).

# 4. Findings

Table 4 gives an overview of the occurrence of theor- in the two corpora. These are the same resuls presented in Gao et al. (2022) but with data from 2020 added. It shows that theor- continues to be used more ofen in qualitative research than in quantitative.

Before addressing the main research questions, we firs examined the 1903 uses to theor todetermine f any were used to dismiss or question the role of theory. Because we found only six examples from four qualitative authors, we kept them in the analysis. n addition, it seemed significant that theory was mentioned because $3 1 . 1 8 \%$ of articles in the corpora did not use the lemma at all. Four of the six negative examples were written by three authors who worked within a conversational analysis framework, as shown in examples (1) and (2), to justify the atheoretical nature of the approach.

a This figure was erroneously reported as 67.67 in Gao et al. (2022). The analysis was not affected.

(1) The reason is that, adopting an ethnomethodologicall oriented CA-SLA perspective on learning, I take an agnostic stance toward theoretical constructs related to learning, and in particular toward cognitivist constructs. (Hauser, 2017; MLJ, p. 714, Qual)   
(2) With such an approach, which is agnostic toward any exogenous theory of learning, it ispossble to describe the displays of sociall distributed cognition that participants make available to each other (and thus to analysts) in and through talk-ininteraction. (Kunitz, 2018; MLJ, p. 66, Qual)

The descriptive statistic for all 1903 uses f theor- are shown in Table 5, which gives the percentage of each move/step out of the total number of theor- uses. In other words, i shows how the authors used theor- in their studies. The move- and step-specific datais represented visually in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. Note that although the statistical analyses can account for the efects of individual authors (e.g, one author's excessive use of theor-), the figures provide only an overview and canot account for the idiosyncrasies of specific authors.

From the statistics and visualizations, two observations can be made. First, both bodies of research (particularly quantitative research) used thr- snte primaril to estblish  terrtory (i., Move 1), tht is to rview the litre in the fld to provide a research context. Second, qualitative studes appeared to use theor to fulfil certain moves (namely, to present the present work) and specifically certain functions (e.g, 3a and 3d) more frequently than quantitative studies, suggesting that thories are an especially important heuristic for qualitative research to justify its significance.

To compare the use of theories in the two research paradigms, we performed two rounds of multilevel multinomial logistic modeling, first on the coding of moves and second on the step-specific coding of the thor- segments in the quantitative and qualitative research articles, with Reearch Type as the fixed effect. As Move 1 was used most requently by both bodies of research, we selected it as the baseline for both rounds of analyses.

When modeling the move-based coding of the theor- uses, we followed a series of model-building strategies to determine which random effcts to include in the null model. Details of this processcan be found in 3 in the supplemental materil. At the end of the process, we included in our null model by-article random intercepts and random slopes for Journal by Research Type as the random effects.

We then entered the only fixed effct, Research Type, into the null model. The results are shown in Table 6. The inclusion of Research Type significantly improved our null model, $\chi ^ { 2 } \left( 2 \right) = 1 9 . 7 8 , p < . 0 0 1$

From Table 6, we may draw the following observations. First, the qualitative and quantitative studies represented in our corpus assigned theor- to different rhetorical move, as reflected by the significant improvement of model fit afer the addition of the fixed effect (i., Research Type). In other words, qualitative researchers were, with Move 1 as the baseline, 2.21 times more likely than their quantitative counterparts to use theor- for Move 3, namely, to present their own work. Second, the articles exhibited considerable variability (variance: 0.19; $9 5 \%$ CI: (0.03, 1.12)) and the Journals also exhibited small-scale variability across the two types of research they published (variance: 0.05; $9 5 \%$ CI: (0.01, 0.30)).

In the analysis on the step-specific data, we followed the same model-building strategies as in the irst round, the specifics of which are reported in S3 in the Supplemental Materials. At the end of the process, we included by-Journal random intercepts as the only random effect in our null model on the step-specific data.

In the following step, we included Research Type in the model, leading to a significant improvement, $- 2 \mathrm { L L } \chi ^ { 2 } ( 1 0 ) = 5 6 . 5 8 , p < . 0 0 1$ Table 7 summarizes the model.

Table 7 presents estimates of the odds of qualitative studies using theor- for each functional step as compared with those for quantitative studies, with the odds for both types of studies to use theor for Move 1 as the baseline or comparison point. From Table 7, the following observations can be made. Firs, the inclusion of research type significantly improved the model fit. Second, in our corpus, the quantitative and qualitative articles used theorie to realize diffrent rhetorical steps. With Move 1 (establishing the territory) as the baseline, the qualitative studies used theor- more frequently than the quantitative counterparts to announce three substeps: (3a) present research descriptively and/or purposively, (3c) offer defintional clarifications, and (3d) summarize, clarify, or justify the method or framework chosen. The results show, with Move 1 as the baseline, that qualitatie studies were, compared with their quantitative counterparts, 1.77 ( $9 5 \%$ CI: (1.24, 2.54) times more likely to use theor- to announce the research content or purpose (3a), 4.09 ( $9 5 \%$ CI: (1.16, 14.45)) times more likely to use theor- to explain key terms, and 4.43 ( $9 5 \%$ CI: (2.49, 7.88)) times more likely to use theor- to summarize, clarif or justify the method or framework chosen. Finally, the variation between journals accounted for considerable variability in the results (variance: 0.21, $9 5 \%$ CI: (0.03, 1.33).

For illustration, the following examples of the segments realizing the 3a, 3c, and 3d steps are extracted from the qualitative subcorpus in examples (3)-(5).

As Move 1 was set up as the baseline in the multilevel multinomial regression and hence remained unexamined, we conducted a logistic reression analys on whether the two bodies of research differed in their use of theor for Move 1. To reduce the risks of Type errors resulting from repeated testing, we performed the analysis on the entire dataset rather than on the studies that used thor. The results showed that the qualitative studies used theor- more frequently for Move 1 than the quantitative studies, with Research Type improving the fit of the null model, $\chi ^ { 2 } ( 1 ) = 2 3 . 5 8 , p < . 0 0 1$ Thus, the qualitative studies were 2.21 times more likely to use theor- for Move 1 than the quantitative studies ( $9 5 \%$ CI: [1.60, 3.06]). Note that although qualitative studies used theor- in Move 1 more often than quantitative studies, the subset of quantitative studies that used theor- were more likely to use it in Move 1 compared to other moves (cf. the percentage of thor- for Move 1 compared with that for Moves 2 and 3 within quantitative and qualitative research in Fig. 2).

Finally, as a separate analysis, we considered Lu e al.'s (2020) ste from Move 3, advancing thoretical claims, which they added to the CARS model. While we did not incorporate the step into our quantitative analysis, we conducted a separate exploratory analysis y considering the possible candidates for this step in the corpus (which had been coded variously as other stes). Because this part of the study was exploratory, two researchers reviewed the coded moves and identified 40 sentences that could potentil have een coded as advancing theoretica claims. Afer discussion among the three researchers we agreed that only 8 sentences from the qualitative studies and 3 from the quantitative studies were candidates for this step as in examples (6) and (7), respectively.

(6) My data call for a fuller materialization, embodiment, and performativity in thorizing language competence than currently conceptualized in applied linguistics.

(Pallotti, 2019; AL, p. 177, Quan)

One unexpected finding was that among the 40 sentences singled out for evaluation was that 13 of the 40, about a third, included a form of the verb theorize. Theorize s a form of theor- was not analyzed for collocations in Gao et al.(2022) because of its lower frequency than other forms. Sentences using the verb form in these 40 sentences were exclusively from qualitative studies. Examples (8) and (9) illustrate this phenomenon.

(8) Drawing on an interdisciplinary body of scholarship on translation .. this study complicates current understanding of trans Iation as a cognitive phenomenon by theorizing translation as distributed, mediated, embodied, and negotiated. (Wang, 2020; JSLW, p. 2, Qual)   
(9) Though making bilingualism central to standards-based reform is necessary for all students, in this article we challenge dominant, monolingual approaches by theorizing a standards-based reform initiative that focuses specifically on emergent bilingual students. (Flores & Schissel, 2014; TQ, p. 455, Qual)

Because of this finding, we investigated the verb form theor, a form not included in Gao et al. (2022) because of its relatively lower frequency. We found that it was used atotal of 122 times, 88 times by 46 qualitative authors and 34 times by 27 quantitative authors and in Move 3, it was used 30 times by qualitative authors and 2 times by quantitative authors, thus showing a clear trend toward use of the verb form in qualitative research. We return to this point in the discussion section.

# 5. Discussion and conclusion

In Gao et al. (2022), we noted that theory was not mentioned at all in $3 8 \%$ of quantitative articles and $2 3 \%$ of qualitative articles on second language learning and teaching and that i was mentioned significantly more often in qualitatie research. By looking at the collocations with theor, we concluded that quantitative studies maintained an epistemic objectivity when invoking the theories because theories were something to be tested and validated. Converely, qualitative studies retained a more heuristic relation with theories, that is theories were guideposts or leses through which to view phenomena. While this is not surrising, we were able to link specific language to each of these views of theory in our corpus of research articles.

By adding data from 2020 to the analysis from Gao et al. (2022) and considering the rhetorical moves, we came to additional conclusions about the discourse used in relation to theory. First, we confirmed the trend that theory (as realized by theor- continues to be more often invoked in qualitative research. In years 2013-2019, $6 2 \%$ of quantitative articles and $7 7 \%$ of qualitative articles used theor-, and in 2020 the distribution was $5 8 \%$ versus $8 0 \%$ In contrast with earlier lamentations over the insufficient role of theory in the field (e.g., Long, 2007), our analys revealed thry as a key, but not required, ource in the cration f a rearch space for current mainstream applied linguistic research, perhaps more so for research adopting a qualitative paradigm. Second, although within qualitative reearch the significance assigned to theory varie from approach to approach (Creswel & Poth, 2018), ur analys ound theory to be more essential to qualitative as compared with quantitative research in questions of leitimacy and authorit, a reflected by qualitative researchers' (overall) heavier reliance on theory for justifications of research significance.

Second, we compared the role of theory from a discursive-functional approach. Our analysis revealed that while the research adopting the two methodologies relies on theory primarily to establish the trritory (Move 1), the use of theor- for this move was more common in qualitative research. However, note that when quantitative researchers used theor, they used it more frequently in Move 1 than with other moves. In addition, qualitative researchers drew on theory more frequently when presenting the present work (Move 3); more specifically, they are more likely to invoke theory to state the research content or purpose (Step 3a), clarify key definitions (Step 3c), and summarize, clarify, or jusify the method or framework chosen (Step 3d). It sems then that with regard to the role of theory in rhetorical moves, both bodies of research (qualitative research in particular) use theory to set the stage, so to speak. By establishing the territory with theory, researchers show how their research can be connected to previous work. Furthermore, qualtative resarcher also retun to theory in the literature review to describe or justif the research. What may be more significan is that qualitative rearchers often use thery to define terms. In comparison, quantitative reearchers oten define terms by operationalizing constructs in the methods section, explaining, for example, how a variable is measured.

Finally, we considered the ste put forth by Lu et al. (2021), advancing theoretical claims. Although we did not confirm that this was a necessary step to include in future versions of the CARS model (Swales, 1990, 2004), we found that when examining possblecases of this move, the verb form thrize, o is nminalizatio, thrztio crred ften and was used xcusively in qualitative rearch in this potential move. Future research on the verb form, thorize, in other disciplines (e.g., education or psychology) can help provide a more comprehensive understanding of the rhetorical function of this particular verb form of theory, especially in qualitative research.

Regarding instructing novice researchers in applied inguistics or researchers trying to understand different research paradigms, it is important to note that these findings are trends and not rules for how to writ up a quantitative or qualitative study. They provide a way to look more closely at one aspect of academic research, namely, how theories are used to position and present research. We stated earlier that our narrow focus on language learning reearch may be a limitation of this study, but at the same time, we, i our position as researchers trained in a more quantitative tradition, were able to discover pattens about qualitative research that were new to us. Specificall, we discovered that conversational analyst eschew theory and that qualitative rearchers use the verb form of theory in a way that we do not flly understand. f we can discover features of academic languageand the structure of academic articles in our own field (through a corpus-based analysis), novices will have even more to discover. On one hand, reearchers in applied linguistcs have arguably become more siloed and may not consider how other paradigms writ or use theory to justify research. On the other hand with more attention on mixed methods research, understanding how the other half writesis important if we are to bridge the quantitative-qualitative gap. Furthermore, anyone teaching a general research methods class needs to undersand the role of theory across paradigms.

In terms of teaching academic writing to students in other fields, we can only help draw their attention to how theories are used in their fields and not instruct them on how to do it. Hands-on data-driven learning activities in advanced EAP classes could be used where students search for forms of theor- and compare their use acrossfield or paradigms. We can also encourage student discussions with their advisors on the topic. On a related note, we fel that our next step nees to be to interview researchers from different paradigms to bettr understand their views on the role f theory and how those views were and continue to be (re)constructed. We also want to delve into their thoughts on the necessty of framing a study with a focus on theory and to hear their advice to noviceresearchers on the topic. Although our study examined only introductions and iterature reviews, students and future researchers should also focus onthe discussion section to better understand how authors return to therie. In sum, as three reearchers at dfferent stages in our careers a corpus-ased analysis of thor- acros two subcorpora of studies on language learning and teaching enabled us to make observations about the structuring of literature reviews that had not been accessble to us by simply reading research in different paradigms. Thus, we feel that narrowly focused corpus-based studies of published research, moving beyond lexical bundles, for example, can provide insights to all.
