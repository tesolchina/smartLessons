Corpus analysis

Titles are a key part of every academic genre and are particularly important in research papers. Today, online searches are overwhelmingly based on articles rather than journals which means that writers must, more than ever, make their titles both informative and appealing to attract readers who may go on to read, cite and make use of their research. In this paper we explore the key features of 5070 titles in the leading journals of six disciplines in the human and physical sciences to identify their typical structural patterns and content foci. In addition to proposing a model of title patterns, we show there are major disciplinary differences which can be traced to different characteristics of the fields and of the topics of the articles themselves. Our findings have important implications for EAP and ERPP teachers working with early career academic writers.

# 1. Introduction

Tites are the most ubiquitous of academic texts, being a key part of every research paper, theis conference presentation and blog post. They not only name the work they accompany and act to pullin potential readers, but their importance in reearch articles has rapidly increased in the age of article-based publishing'. Today almost al the major publishers have prioritised the quicker delivery and easier internet searching of individual papers and relegated the volume/issue shell f journals to archiving. Publication is thus geared towards discrte artices, available online as they are ready without waiting for an issue to be compiled, allowing faster publication and citation. This makes tite acentral element f research visbility as readers typically find papers through keywordgenerated online search results rather than by scanning the contents tables of favourite journals (e.g. Hsin et al., 2016). As a result, writers have an interes in making their tite both informative and appealing to attract readers who may go on to read, cite and make use of their research. As Belcher observes (2021: 282), "Your title is the highway billboard of your article"'.

In an age where careers are dominated by performance metrics, a good title can therefore contribute to the reputation and pro fessional advancement of its writer. The mega Open Access science publisher PLos, for instance, reinforces the idea:

Once readers find your artice, they'lluse the titl as the firs filte to decide whether your rearch is what they're looking for. A strong and specific title is the first step toward citations, inclusion in meta-analyses, and influencing your field.

Given the prominence of titles, advanced EAP students, and those studying English for Research and Publication Purpose courses would benefit from an awarenessof ths mportance and a better understanding of their feature. We hope the findings wl also benei hose who assist and instruct novice writers with their efforts to publish.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the most frequent patterns and features of titles in leading jounals in the human and physical sciences to identify what, through sucessull published article tes in top journals, aadmics regard as strong and specific about titles. We focus on 65 papers from each of 13 highly ranked journals in six fields, a total of 5070 tite, to answer the following questions:

1. What are the typical formal patterns of titles in published articles?   
2. Are there disciplinary differences in the structure and length of these titles?   
3. Are there disciplinary differences in the focus of these titles?   
4. How might we explain these differences?

# 2. Titles in research writing

Researchers, of course, want their work to be read and, perhaps equall, to be cited, and this is increasingly difficult with the tsunami of papers afecting every disciline. Competition to be noticed is intense, as eight million academics in 17,000 universities around the world seek to get their voices heard in English-language journals each year (UNesco, 2017). One of the largest journal publishers, sevier fr example, reorts over tw million article submitted and ne billon red in 2019 (REL, 2020). Authors then need to lever every advantage they can to hook potential readers especially as search patterns now involve combing intenet databases rather than individual journals. The tles of academic papers thus rflect how authors believe they willbes attract an audience for their work, and various means are used to achieve this, including statements, questions, puns, cultural allusions, quotations, compounds, etc. It is unclear, however, how authors achieve their goal in different fields.

What we do know is that the ways readers use tites have changed as technologies have come to determine the search and, by extension, reading patterns of academics. Thirty years ago, for example, Bazerman (1988: 239) spoke of biophysicists in fast moving fields staying current by visiting the library once a week to search the tables of content of newly arrived journals. Scanning these contents involved rapid processing based on the topics or approaches in titles, which triggered thir atention'. Even 15 years ago, title-scanning was still:

a regular activity within the scientific community for whom part of its daily routine is to search tites in libraries, catalogues, periodical indexes, references, databases, and tables of contents of edited books, reports, and proceedings.

(Soler, 2007: 91)

Today, academics are more likely to search Google Scholar, rely on email alerts from key journals or use tools such as PubCrawler,3 which automaticallysearches online publication databases such as PubMed using key search terms and then sends weekly emails highlighting potentiall relevant papers (Pain, 2016). Allthese methods, however, rely on the information writrs provide in their titles.

To better accommodate these internet searches, numerous science journals have introduced detailed reporting guidelines. In the biomedical sciences, for example journals inroduced title requrements 20 years ago, and this may have influenced both the form and content of titles in that field. One major shift has been longer titles and the growing mention of methods i clinical Research Article (RA) titles, although this trend seems to differ by journal (Kerans et a., 2020). There has also een a substantial and consistent trend towards more concrete and defintive tites in sychology ince the mid-1980s (Whissel, 2012) and, despiteadvice not to use them, an increasing use of question marks in the social sciences (Ball, 2009). These requirements and trends potentiallycreate problems for authors using English as an additional language as longer, richer titles mean having to deal with greater phrasing complexity.

There is, however, no shortage of advice for learners on how to write enticing titles. Most sources recommend that writers keep their titles short, avoid irony, jargon and humour and aim to make them clear, informative and specific (e.g. Grant, 2013; Gustavil, 2012; Hays, 2010; Hartey, 2005). Such discussions of title, however, tend to be short, prescriptive and intuitive. The widely used books by Belcher (2021), Day (2008) and Cargill and Connor (2013), for example, deote only a few page at most to tles and offer general advice such as making the title specific, relevant and packed with searchable keywords. Palridge and Starfield (2016) and Swales and Feak (2012), however, encourage eders to analyse thetitle they find in target journals and disciplines, asking if they get a clear sense from them of what the article is about. Advice also appears in authoritative style guides, so, for example, the APA (2020) manual advises writers to keep their tite focused, no more than 12 words long and without abbreviations or words that serve no purpose'. In the sciences, $\mathrm { P L O S ^ { 4 } }$ also recommends brevity, informativity and incorporation of keywords; it also admonishes writers to avoid sensationalism and questions.

Some journals also specify title requirements, especially in the sciences, some being very specific: Nature': Titles must fit on two lines in print and should avoid technical terms, abbreviations and active verbs. $C e l l ^ { 6 }$ : The titl should capture the conceptual significance for a broad audience. The most effective titles are no more than 10 to 12 words and provide an overall view of the paper's significance rather than the detailed contents of the paper.

$B M J ^ { 7 }$ : The title should be informative and, for research papers, a subtitle with the study design (for example, a phase II clinical trial' or "a systematic review and meta-analysis").

Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics : A short informative title that contains the major key words. The titl should not contain abbreviations.

It is unclear, however, the extent to which writers actually observe these instructions. Kerans et al. (2020), for example, found that fewer than half thetles in their corpus of medical journals actually complied with instructions to mention a result, although some might have implied results to an insider. About a third of the titles they coded as including results, moreover, only d so mplicitly with phrases like "improved [outcome] with [treatment]". In Goodman et al.'s (2001) medical corpus results appeared in only $1 8 \%$ of titles. Similarl, Gastel and Day's (2017 p. 42) admonishments to avoid compound tite (those divided into two parts), as pedantic and confusing to indexes, eems to be largely ignored in the sciences with an increase in recent years (e.g. Milojevic, 2017). Soler (2007) also found a heavy use of compound constructions in social science disciplines while Lewison and Hartley (2005) and Hartley (2007) found compound constructions, especially those where the parts were separated by a colon, to be very common intitles.

Most research studies have taken a normative stance, seeking to advise authors what they should do to gain attention, by iden. tifying tite features which correlate with high citation counts (e.g. Paiva et al., 2012; Thelwall, 2017). So, longer titles are cited more often in many disciplines Jacques & Sebire, 2010, pp. 2-3; van Wesel, Wyat & ten Haaf, 2014), although this might not be the casein pure sciences (van Wesel et al., 2014). itles that contain a colon may be more likely to attract citations (Buter & van Raan, 2011; Jacques & Sebire, 2010), while those with question marks had poorer citation rates (Paiva et al., 2012).

In the largest study to date, Hudson (2016) examined the impact of multiple authorship on the te of papers submitted to the UK's four-yearly Research Evaluation Framework (the REF) in 2014. This involved 15,500 articles in 36 disciplines with the main findings being tht i the engths of the tites inrsed with the number f athors in amost all discilines, ) the use f colons and question marks tended to decline with increasing author numbers in most fields, (ii, citations to papers were higher when the tites were shorter and contained colons, (iv) citations were lower when they contained question marks. The author observes, however, that these results varied considerably between the disciplines, a finding which is repeated for other features of titles.

Hartley (2007) showed discilinary differences in the use of colons, for instance, with a greater use in the arts than in the sciences and also in the work of single authors than multiple authors. Haggan (2004) concurs, showing colons to comprise $6 1 \%$ of titles in literature journals compared with less than $3 0 \%$ in linguistics and sciences. Nagano (2015) and Milojevic (2017) argue that the length of titles also differs between disciplines,being longer in the hard sciences such as medicine than the discursive ciences such as sociology. Terminology has aso atracted attention. Anthony (2001), for example found considerable use of discipline and field-specific lexis in 600 papers from six IEEE computer science journals. ooking at the form of tites in a small corpus of 574 tites in three disciplines, Appiah et al. (2019) found that noun phrases dominated the titles aross the thee fields, but busines titles were longer than those in gynaecology and law and more likely to contain compound units with a colon. Soler (2007) found a prevalence of nominal group titles in the science titles in her sample of $4 8 0 ~ \mathrm { R A }$ titles and that full-sentence title constructions were a disciplinary peculiarity of Biology titles. Wang and Bai (2007) also found that $9 9 \%$ of titles in the New England Journal of Medicine were nominal groups. Krans et al. (2020) noted substantial variation in the mention of methods i title and the mention of results dffered between general and more specific journals.

Overall the relative lack of research into tites may lead us to suppose that practices are homogeneous across the academy, but What reearch there is shows different interests and foci with tites differentiated by topic, jounal and disciline. This is beause, we assume, tites aim to both attract and inform and these goals are achieved in different ways in different contexts. ites have to be sufficiently appealing to grab attention and appropriately descriptive of the article's content to be detected by informatio rtrieval systems. However, there is a tension here as longer titles may increase information content but reduce the amount of interest they create. These variations can confuse novice writers and their teachers and so their analysis may asst those engaged in writing for publication courses. Here we explore the use of titles in six contrasting fieds to identify their main characterisics and the ways that discipline can influence them.

# 3. Corpus and methods

In order to compile as representative a corpus as possible we aimed for both adequate breadth and a large size. We selected six disciplines offering a wide spread of disciplinary practices from the sciences, social sciences and humanities using categories recognised by SCImago: applied inguistics (AL), education (Edn), history (His), mathematics (Math), mechanical engineering (Eng) and biochemistry (Bio). From each discipline we selected 13 journals from among the highest rated journals on the SCImago journal rankings (list in Appendix). From the tables of contents on each individual journal website we used stratified random sampling to identify the titles of 65 original full research articles published over the last 8 years to ensure greater comparability, eliminating reviews, correspondence, case reports and theoretical papers. This produced a corpus of 5070 article tites (Table 1) which exceeded almost all previous studies of titles.

The corpus was searched both manually and automatically, using AntConc (Anthony, 2019), to gain some understanding of the tite, identifying non-alphanumeric characters, such as colons, hyphens, question marks, et, as well as words with the potential to mark content. After several attempts, we devised the structure described in section 5 below, distinguishing indicative and inter rogative according tosyntax, the use f punctuation to create two-part tes, and whether the example rferenced methods or results. Using this structure, each author independently coded a $3 0 \%$ sample of the corpus manually and an inter-rater agreement of $9 6 \%$ was achieved through discussion. Intra-reliability tests were also conducted by one author re-categorising $2 0 \%$ of the cases two weeks after the initial coding with full agreement between the two. All titles were then categorised according to the model.

We chose to focus on these formal features as objective and measurable means of distinguishing the preferences of diffrent dis ciplines for particular kinds of tite. They are the characteristics that are most often discussed in the research litrature and have tended tocur most frequently in style guide. Some how to authors admonish their readers to avoid broad, dense, ambiguous or clever' title (e.g. Belcher, 2021), but we fel illequipped to make judgements which might not correspond with those f others - particularly those of disciplinary insiders. How explicit does a tite on endocrinology or electromagnetic fields need to be before it becomes dense', for example? Without clear identifying criteria these are problematic categories to study in a large corpus such as ours. We also assume these transgressions willoccur only inrequentl in these succesully published papers. All our numeric data were imported into MATLAB (Version: R2020b (9.9.0. 1467703), a programming and numeric computing plaform for analyzing data and creating models. We used this to calculate the length of titles, grouping them by discipline, and the frequencies of each target feature per 100 words. The results are discussed in the following sections.

# 4. At some length: how long is a title?

We first looked at the length of titles, finding considerable disciplinary variabilit. Title length is considered important for the retrieval, and thus the eventual citation, of artices. Because longer titles contain more words they offer more scope for search words but this can also make them inelegant and \*more difficult to digest and may reduce the attaction factor" (Hudson, 2016, p. 878) Shorter titles may also indicate a more specific scope and can attract a higher number of views and citations (Paiva et al., 2012), although other studies have found the opposite. Jacques and Sebire (2010) and van Wesel e l. (2014), for example, found a positive correlation between length and impact in medical articles and Milojevic (2017) found the same in astronomy and ecology but not in mathematics, robotics and economics. There also seems to be a negative relationship in biology and social sciences (Didegah & Thelwal, 2013) sociology (van Wesel et al., 2014), and psychology (Subotic & Mukherjee, 2014). Sothe jury i out on the advantages of longer titles and a causal connection remains to be established.

As we noted above, the average length of tles sems to be strongly discipline-dependent (Milojevic, 2017; Nagano, 2015; Soler, 2007), with longer titles produced by larger teams (White, 1991) and now averaging $4 0 \%$ longer than 60 years ago (Milojevic, 2017). Speculatively this is a result of the greater detail needed to distinguish them from previous, possibly more general, studies as fields evolve. Kerans et al.'s (2020) study of RA titles in eight top-ranked journals i clinical medicine notes that exceptionally long titles appear consistently only in some clinical journals and that the trend towards longer titles may have stabilised.

Using the technical omputing language MATLAB, we rouped all 5070 title into four categories depending on their length. These results, shown in Table 2, confirm disciplinary variation in title length, revealing the surprising finding that longer titles tended to be more common in the more discursive social science disciplines than the sTEM papers. This contradicts Nagano (2015), but as she focused on artices in just four relatively prestigious journals in each field, therults may have been influenced by the conventions of particular jourals. Similarly, Soler (2007) found average title lengths higher i hre hard ciences, but this wassmallr-cale study and refers to articles published between 1996 and 2002, and so does not take account of changes in the last 20 years.

As can be seen, applied linguist, educationalis and historians seem to prefer titles over 12.5 words long while mathematicians, biochemists and engineers had much lower averages. ike our study, Lewison and Hartley (2005), looking at half a dozen STEM fields found that mathematicians employed the shortest ite, with around nine words, while biology had the longest, averaging 15. In fact, $7 0 \%$ of the tles in our maths corpus were under 10 words. The reason for these disciplinary differences is unclear, but the numbers certainly suggest definite disciplinary preferences.

One explanation for different title lengths may lie in the nature of the specific reearch undertaken. Thus in newly emerging areas, those with lttle activity or in overviews, shorter titls are able to capture the broad scope of the paper in an immediate and engaging way:

1) Lumpen Politics? A Day in \*El Hueco' (Hist)   
2) Additive manufacturing of multi-material structures (Eng)   
3) Does College Influence Sociopolitical Attitudes? (Edn)

Such succinctness of course, runs the risk of promising more than can be delivered within the confines of a short paper, or, equally, of condensing information to the point of excluding all readers but the most informed specialist:

4) Riemannian hyperbolization (Maths)   
5) Regular supercuspidal representations. (Maths)   
6) A Thermally Reformable Protein Polymer (Bio)

The ability to compress a topic to its bare bones in this way therefore risks narrowing the potential udience for a paper and so minimising its impact in terms of readership and citations.

In contrast, authors working in more densely explored and contested areas are more likely to spell out what is distinctive about their study to distinguish it from the herd and attract the larger number of authors working in that field:

(7) A unified methodology for calculation of compliance and stiffes contribution tensors of inhomogeneitie of arbitrary 2D and 3D shapes embedded in isotropic matrix - open access software (Eng)   
(8) Do Schools Reduce or Exacerbate Inequality? How the Associations Between Student Achievement and Achievement Growth Influence Our Understanding of the Role of Schooling. (Edn)

Such explicit labelling, however, lacks the catchy impact of shorter versions and may be missed by the algorithms which search for research topics.

An alternative explanation for differences in title lengths is that unlike physical scientists, social scientists work in ars which often span more disparate audiences which may lack the background needed to see the importance and coverage of the work. Research is often lesslinear and more disparat, interdisciplinary and less bound to a specific context of knowledge, which means titles may require greater explicitness, and so length, to create such a recognizable context:

(9) Where's the vision? Rescuing integrativeness to undersand the language learning motivation of English-speaking EFL in structors living in South Korea. (AL)   
(10) How Many Household Formation Systems Were There in Historic Europe? A View Across 256 Regions Using Partitioning Clustering Methods. (Hist)

Similarly, longer titles help spell out the topic to specify what might be new, encouraging readers to explore the text further and discover results relevant to their own work:

(11) Do Schools Reduce or Exacerbate Inequality? How the Associations Between Student Achievement and Achievement Growth Influence Our Understanding of the Role of Schooling (Edn)   
(12) Camp Composition and the Rocky Mountain Fur Trade: Estimating the Native Presence at the Early Rendezvous and Winter Camps, 1825-1830 (Hist)

Whatever the reason, it isclear that some disciplines have a greater tolerance or ned for longer titles and this llows authors to offer a more explicit representation of their work. We now turn to the ways authors structure their titles.

# 5. Representing research: title structures

The literature offers almost as many structures to describe titles as there are studies of them. Hartle (2008) lists 13 different formats. Thee range from titls that announce the geral ubject (e. On writin acadmic tiles, state finding e.tites grow with number of authors) or indicate a controlling question (e.g. How do academics writ titles?) through to those that offer descriptions or optins (.  ype f tite Krs t al. (2020) fs on h rts of medl joual ti iudd i ther tite, hr wth the number of parts of the titles and their punctuation, adding up to ten sub-types. Soler (2007) gives a description of four types: nominal group, full sentence, compound, and question whil, in a later study of 260 titles in one education journal, Hartley (2017) suggests three: those with a colon, single sentence and question. Jamali and Nikzad (2011) also identify three common types:

declarative ites, which stat the main findings, descriptive tite, which simply describe the subject of the articl, and interrogative titles, which present the topic as a question.

As can be seen, however, these categorisations often tend toconfuse form with content, fail to show the connections between them and obscure the fact that very few of the described styles are actually used, thus giving undue prominence to infrequent types. Some prioritise positioning or grammatical pattrning, and others punctuation or content. We sought to create a robust and comprehensive model to help iluminate the options availableto writers and reveal the preferences of those working in different disciplines. Drawing on the earlier models and after several abortive attempts, we settled on a tree iagram which categorises the titles acording to their form and then their content. This meant coding all 5070 cases as having either an Indicative or Iterrogative tructure, and identifying these as either a single sentence, conveying the topic, or a compound, comprising two parts separated by a colon or other punctuation. Each Compound can be descriptive, simply stating the topic, or detailed, including the approach or results. This is shown diagram matically as Fig. 1 together with the raw figures for each branch to indicate its overall use. We elaborate these below.

# 5.1. Syntactic types: indicative or interrogative?

Titles are either indicative or interrogative: posed as a statement or a question. Fig. 1 shows that they are overwhelmingly of the former type in all fields. The latter type comprise just $8 . 5 \%$ of all titles in our corpus. Table 3, however, shows clear disciplinary differences, with less than $^ { 1 \% }$ of interrogative titles in the three STEM disciplines - which show a strong preference for indicative titles.

Clearly, indicative tites are able to express the topic of the paper in a straighforward, no-nonsense way, either briefly or with elaboration to include not only the topic (13), but also the approach (14) or the result (15):

(13) Geometric criteria for overtwistedness (Maths) (14) A Longitudinal Study of Voice Onset Time Development in L2 Spanish Stops (AL) (15) The Hannes hand prosthesis replicates the key biological properties of the human hand (Eng)

These writers ar intent on presenting the topic of their paper i a clear and acessible way which minimizes processing efort an will not confuse algorithmic searches. The preference for indicative tites in thesciences might be a consequence of this and the fin admonishments of key journals, publishers and style guides to ensure brevity and informativity and avoid questions, which might b seen as distracting and gimmicky.

Although other studies confirm this, it is perhaps, surrising to find sofew interrogatives in the corpus. Aftr all acadmic research is governed by questioning. Papers are written with questions in mind or problems to solve, but they seem to rarely emerge explicitly in tites. Despite increasing over time, they are stll rare in the sciences (Cook & Plourde, 2016; Fox & Burns, 2015). Hudson (2016) found that titles which included question marks were longer than ther tites, helping to explain th longer tite in thesoft sciences. While it is hard to establish causality, astudy of over 200 artices published in 6 PLoS science journals found that those with question titles were more often downloaded, but less frequently cited (Jamali & Nikzad, 2011).

Questions, however, exploit the interactivity of familiar conversational discourses and have the impact to grab the reader at the outset with an arresting diretness and o demand ttention with a striking expression. This s ll the more provocative when ound in a discipline which normally shuns interrogatives:

(16) Why Webster? (Maths) (17) What is the future of immunotherapy in multiple myeloma? (Bio) (18) Aztecs Abroad? Uncovering the Early Indigenous Atlantic (Hist)

Questions in titles, however, are never a naive display of ignorance, nor do they simply signal the topic of a paper. They both promote the article itself to the reader and represent the writer as someone with an insider's understanding of what constitutes a real issue and who has a plausible response to it.

# 5.2. Formats: single or compound?

Beyond selecting either an indicative or interrogative tite, authors have the option of a single format, decribing the article in one sentence, or as a compound of two or more parts separated by punctuation, usually a colon. Tables 4 and 5 show that single formats predominated, but only marginally, at $5 5 \%$ of the total, with compounds dominating the interrogative forms. More striking, perhaps, are the disciplinary contrasts, with the hard sciences overwhelmingly favouring single forms and the soft sciences preferring compounds.

Single tite, as we have noted, generallyoffr straightforward representations of what the reader wil find in the accompanyin. article. Their effectiveness les in their transparency and this can be disarmingly direct and effectively minimalistic:

Often, however, their impact lies in their detail, providing more targets for automated searches and suggesting both potentially relevant material for readers and a credible indication of the author's competence:

(21) Multistage distributionally robust mixed-integer programming with decision-dependent moment-based ambiguit sets (Maths (22) Roles of MACl in Sequentially Deposited Bromine-Free Perovskite Absorbers for Eficient Solar Cells ( Eng)

Interrogative forms can be particularly disaming, apparently posing real and enticing questions that are almost journalistic in the. effect of capturing attention and arousing interest:

(23) How Does the Ribosome Fold the Proteome? (Bio) (24) How many rushed during the Oklahoma land openings? (Hist)

Single titles are therefore typically unadorned and explicit, speaking to the community directly and through the earch engines they use. This, then, may be one important reason why the sTM authors favour this form as in some ways their audience is relatively better defined than the social science readers. The way that scientific knowledge is created, ste-by-tep in a more linear fashion, helps define a specific context of researchto which the current work is a contributio: a problem being addressed within an established framework of knowledge. This means that scientists can presuppose a certain amount of shared knowledge with the potential audience and can refer to this in a dirct and straightforward way. The ocial scietists, on the other hand, oftn need to laborate what readers will find in the paper to atract an audience who may be unfamiliar with the area (e.g. Becher & Trowler, 2001; Hyland, 2004).

Compound titles, containing non-alphanumeric characters, such as colons, hyphens, dashes, and periods, allow authors to expand the topic in this way and are extremely commonplace across the soft knowledge disciplines. Only $^ { 1 5 \% }$ of the hard science titles in our corpus comprised compound types and the differences across fields, in fact, are considerable: ranging from $8 2 \%$ in History to $5 \%$ in

Maths. Hartley (2007) also found greater use of ompounds in the Arts than in the sciences while Lewison and Harte (2005) observed that single authors used significantly more colonic titles than groups of authors, sugesting why they might be dominant in the soft fields. Overall, however, the literature has been preoccupied with discovering whether compound tites are asciated with higher citations. Jacques and Sebire (2010) and Buter and van Raan (2011), for example, believe they are while Hartley (2007) found the opposite. Thus, once again, disciplinary preferences influence practices. As can be seen in our example, the prevalent punctuation is the colon, which seems to have increased in popularity in recent years (Lewison & Hartley, 2005) although Jamali and Nikzad (2011) found that articles with a colon had both fewer downloads and fewer citations.

Using punctuation to provide asubtitle or a multicomponent title enables authors to pack more information into their title and so may be associated with the longer tite i the social sciences. ompounds allow authors to pack more information into a title by either elaborating the topic (25) or by specifying it more precisely (26)

(25) Recipes for Respect: African American Meals and Meaning (Hist) (26) Simulation-Based Learning in Higher Education: A Meta-Analysis (Edn)

Compounds also provide authors with the opportunity to enliven their title, sometimes by a pop culture reference (27-28) or more often by a quotation (29-30), which are particularly favoured by applied linguists and historians:

(27) Space Oddities: The Acquisition of Agreement Verbs by L2 Learners of Sign Language of the Netherlands (AL)   
(28) Sympathy for the devil? A defence of EAP (AL)   
(29) \*We are all republicans": Political Articulation and the Production of Nationhood in France's Face Veil Debate. (Hist)   
(30) "I believe the findings are fascinating': Stance in 3-min theses (AL)

Interrogative compounds, as Table 5 shows, are almost non-existent in the science titles, representing the two patterns least faoured by scientists. A desire to convey the content direct and concisely, the admonishment of style guides and the proscriptions of journals may combine t retict this form to the oft knowledge journals. We turn to these compound types in more detail in the next section.

# 5.3. Compound content: descriptive or detailed?

The final level of our hierarchy of author choices concerns the content of the title and whether to opt for a descriptive tite or one adorned with greater detail. Because single types principall concen the topic of the paper, we focus here on how authors exercise the options that compound titles make available. Compounds, as we noted, asist authors in presenting an informative, yet concise, statement of ther paper. The interrelationship between the two parts can succnctly present the object f study in dffrent ways. They may offer the topic in general and specific terms, a problem followed by a solution, a topic with a method, a topic with a resul, and so on. We suggest that the author has two main options: should the itle be descriptive, that is indicate only the subject of the article or detailed, statig the mai findings or approach? Inteestingly, while the later is more informative, over thre quarters of our 5070 titles were descriptive (Table 6).

(31) Breaking barriers: Quebec platelet disorder (Bio) (32) "I'm a Teacher, I'm Gonna Always Protect You': Understanding Black Educators' Protection of Black Children (Edn)

Alternatively the second part can function to generate interest from a recognizable context (33) or offer a solution to known problems (34):

Table 6 Distribution of compound title types $( \% )$ . i Descriptive types can clarify the topic following a general, atention-grabbing opening (31), or quotation (32):   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Descriptive (Topic only)</td><td>Detailed (Approach or result)</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Indicative</td><td>76.8</td><td>23.2</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>Interrogative</td><td>78.9</td><td>21.1</td><td>100</td></tr></table></body></html>

(33) Knowledge construction in academia:A challenge for multilingual scholars (AL) (34) Overcoming blood-brain barrier transport: Advances in nanoparticle-based drug delivery strategies (Eng)

In interrogative formats, descriptive title can make a powerful impression by arresting the reader with an eye catching and stimulating problem, following up the question with a clearer statement of the topic:

(35) Can pandemics affect educational attainment? Evidence from the polio epidemic of 1916 (Hist) (36) Should We Listen or Read? Modality Effects in Implicit and Explicit Knowledge (AL)

Such strategies present readers with an issue that they realise they may want to learn more about, recognising that the question is rhetorical and the tite promises an answer in the paper. Interestingly, biochemists tend to favour a reversal of ths patern, with the question concluding a statement of the topic, thereby problematising the familiar and raising an issue which challenges current thinking on a topic:

(37) Lipid nanovesicles for biomedical applications: What is in a name'? (Bio)   
(38) Plant-based sterols and stanols in health & disease: \*Consequences of human development in a plant-based environment?" (Bio)   
(39) An appraisal of meta-analysis guidelines: how do they relate to safety outcomes? (Bio)

ii Detiled title, on the ther hand, are more informative. They not only describe the topic but also fer greater detail about either the main findings of the study or, more often, the methodology used to reach them. Thus, in (40) a question informs the reader what the paper is about and then how this will be answered using a comparative methodology of legislative proposals. Example (41), an indicative case, informs potential readers that the artice contains a study of a current problem using a cutting-edge methodology.

(40) Exclusion or exemption from risk regulation? A comparative analysis of proposals to amend the EU GMO legislation (Bio) (41) Laser writing of electronic circuitry in thin film molybdenum disulfide: A transformative manufacturing approach (Eng)

Alldisciplines show alear preferenc for dritive tites, preferring to hold thr fire onthe dtas of their studie. Table 7 shows that only education and engineering flout this patern in any major way, presenting about one-third of their tites as detailed types. Titles in history and mathematics offer readers very little additional information about the papers they accompany.

When authors chose to provide a detailed title they overwhelmingly did so by adding the approach or methodology adopted in the study, rather than the reults so aiding arches and couraging reders to read on. This may be especiall usful in atracting readers who may be using the same method or looking for innovative approaches to a shared problem:

(42) Developing and Validating an Academic Vocabulary List in Russian: A Computational Approach. (AL) (43) Asessing the security of ectricity supply through mult-scale modeling: The TIMEs-ANTARES linking approach (Eng) (44) Avant-garde: an automated data-driven DIA data curation tool (Bio)

Combining an approach with an interrgative in a detailed title can be particularly effctive in making a strong impression on potential readers by suggesting that the writer has a methodological solution to a common problem:

(45) It has no meaning to me." How do researchers understand the effectiveness of literature searches? A qualitative analysis and preliminary typology of understandings (Edn) (46) Thriving? Or Surviving? An Approach-Avoidance Perspective on Adult Language Learners' Motivation (AL)

The inclusion of results in titles seems to be on the increase in biological science journals such as Cell (Rosner, 1990) but is somewhat controversial, especially in medical literature, with some journals banning mention of results and others insisting on it (McGowan & Tugwell, 205). In Kerans et al's (2020) smallscale study of tites in medical papers, only those in the dermatology journals mentioned results and Wager e al. (2016) found readers were not overly influenced by them. I our corpus they are relatively rare, presumably because authors dont want to givetoo much away before they get aclick recorded on the paper itself Where they do occur, they are often outsider-opaque, enticing further investigation of the paper:

Table 7 Compound types by discipline $( \% )$   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Discipline</td><td colspan="2">Indicative</td><td colspan="2">Interrogative</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Descriptive</td><td>Detailed</td><td>Descriptive</td><td>Detailed</td></tr><tr><td>App Ling</td><td>71.8</td><td>28.2</td><td>87.9</td><td>12.1</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>57.5</td><td>42.5</td><td>65.3</td><td>34.7</td></tr><tr><td>History</td><td>96.7</td><td>3.3</td><td>97.0</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>Mathematics</td><td>88.9</td><td>11.1</td><td>0.0</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>Biochemistry</td><td>76.3</td><td>23.7</td><td>100</td><td>0.0</td></tr><tr><td>Engineering</td><td>67.2</td><td>32.8</td><td>93.3</td><td>6.7</td></tr></table></body></html>

(48) Nothing to lose: why early career scientists make ideal entrepreneurs (Bio)   
(49) Does an Option to Review Instructional Explanations Enhance Example-Based Learning? It Depends on Learners Academic Self Concept (AL)

An interesting variation, found almost exclusively in the applied linguistics papers, is the writer's decision tofront the result in the title, thereby challenging title norms and forcing readers to reflect for a moment:

(50) Statisical Regularities Affct the Perception of Second Language Speech: Evidence from Adult Classroom Learners of Mandarin Chinese (AL)   
(51) Second and third language learners sensitivity to Japanese pitch accent is additive: an information-based model of pitch perception (AL)   
(52) Pronunciation Can Be Acquired Outside the Classroom: Design and Assessment of Homework-Based Training (AL)

This strategy therefore achieves its impact by creating a dissonance in the reader's expectations, presenting what is new, or what might be thought to be the bottom line of the paper, in the thematic given' position. This then encourages the reader to pause in scanning potential title to focus on this one and perhaps be drawn to the rheme of the title whichcontains information about the way the result was obtained.

# 6. Conclusions

Article titles are a rich source of information about disciplines, fields, journals and the proclivities of individual authors. They reveal something of fashionable topics and emerging sub-fields, but for EAP researchers they are important for what they tellus about authors perceptions of disciplinary practices and how they think they might best reach potential readers. While most studies have focused (inconclusively) on corrlations of particular aspects of titles with impact in specific fields, we have cast our net more widely and sought to discover patterns and characteristcs of tites acros a range of disciplines. Such information is useful for understanding more about the proceses of knowledge creation, about publishing practices, and about how we might usefully advise novice researchers.

Returning to our research questions, we have found some contradictions between the advice provided by style guides and journal requirements and actual instances of academic titles. While Gastel and Day's (2017) caution to avoid questions is largely adhered to, especially in the sciences, authors make considerable use of compound titles to elaborate their topics and, ocasionally, to indicate their methods. Unfortunately, much of the avice, while wellintentioned and sensible, ften sems vague or contradictory. Students, for example, are likely to have difficulties in making practical use of admonishments such as \*provide as much relevant information as possible but be concise" (Cargill & O'Connor, 2013: 61), \*have an argumentative title" (Belcher, 2021, p. 289), or to make thir tles "tand out in sme way . but als tell the reader what the paper is about Hartle, 2008, p.23. e have also observed thatitles in the more discursiesoft felds are generally longer, contain more inerrogative and compound forms and, aside from history, are more likely to mention the approach or findings.

These diffrences are hard to explain given the need for hard scientists toclearly distinguish their work from others in the heavily crowded lines of inquiry pursued in the STEM disciplines. Theirs is a highly competitive environment of considerable investment and fast-paced publishing to establish early priority, and where researchers inhabit arelatively discrete and clearly identifiable area of study. The social scientists, however, have their own issues to address. While their research might be more diverse and interdisci. plinary, the f th i follows e ir trcks and ek to pal o wider, more hetrgs dee, mens that it is hadr to assume a coherent and expectant cohort of readers. It is therefore possible, because they cannot presuppose the same degree of research background, knowledge of prior work and theoretical understandings among readers, their tites have to be catchier and more explicit to create rather than assume an audience for the work.

In other words, titles are not produced from an infinite range of options but from a relatively restricted sub-set which reveal how their authors understand their communities. Any title anticipate a reader's response and addresses wider expectations, so that choices are disciplinary practice as much as individual decisions. Tites, then, like the articles which follow them, are co-constructed within the "conceptual frames' (Hyland, 2012) of disciplines and so represent something of how members understand what is likely to be effective and familiar to colleagues. In the classroom this means, like most features of aademic writing, that one size does not fit ll and that teachers mentoring novice researchers might be advised to focus on both the discipline, and possibly the journals, that students are ken to target. Teachers might find it useful, for example, to ask students to ponder the purpose of tles and consider a sample with different structure on the same topic in thir own ar in order to judge their effctivenes. ltenatively, they might edit draft titles to improve their impact or compare the features of titles in different fields to discover how they work.

Finally, we hope our decription of tle proves useful to teachers and that reearchers fel it is worth developing further, perhaps through investigating users preferences and perspectives. The titles often an unconsidered aspect f academic discourse research, but it plays an increasingly important role inknowledge construction by encouraging readers to notice, and perhaps subsequently read and cite, new research. In Swales' (1990: 224) memorable words, \*Titles consist of only a few words, but they are serious stuff"
