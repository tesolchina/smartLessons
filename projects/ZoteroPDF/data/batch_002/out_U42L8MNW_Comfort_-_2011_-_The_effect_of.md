Peer tutoring has been shown to be highly effective in enhancing both tutor and tutee achievements and skill development in a range of educational settings, although this has not currently been investigated in an applied sports science degree setting. The aim of this investigation, therefore, was to determine if peer tutoring enhanced achievement of tutees during practical assessments on an applied sports science degree programme.

Final year students on an undergraduate applied sports science degree programme provided optional peer tutored practical sessions, twice per week (two hours per session) for a period of eight weeks, for students in the second year of the same undergraduate degree programme. Grades the of $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ year tutees (Group 1; $n { = } 1 2$ ) were compared to the grades of the students that did not attend the optional peer tutoring (Group 2; $n { = } 1 6$ ), and the grades of students from the previous year, who were not peer tutored (Group 3; $n { = } 2 4$ ). Results demonstrated that peer tutoring (Group 1) resulted in significantly $\scriptstyle ( p = 0 . 0 0 3 )$ higher grades $( 7 5 . 0 0 { \pm } 1 0 . 5 8 \% )$ compared to students that were not peer tutored (Group 2: $5 1 . 8 1 { \pm } 1 8 . 4 9$ , $\scriptstyle { p = 0 . 0 0 3 }$ ; Group $3 \colon 5 9 . 4 8 { \pm } 1 9 . 2 1 $ , $p { = } 0 . 0 1 4 $ .

This study demonstrates that peer tutoring during practical sessions on applied sports science programmes can enhance the achievement of tutees during practical assessments. It is therefore recommended that peer tutoring is adopted as an effective teaching and learning method for the development of students’ practical skills during undergraduate sports science degrees.

# Introduction

The benefits of peer tutoring have been investigated in a range of subject areas, including computer literacy (Park, Sim, & Rob, 2008), languages (Maynard & Almarzouqi, 2006), economics (Topping et al., 1997), medicine (Sobral, 2002), mathematics (Houston & Lazenbatt, 1999) and physical education (Johnson & Ward, 2001).

Research has demonstrated that peer tutoring can enhance both the tutees’ (Topping, 1996; Topping et al., 1997; Houston & Lazenbatt, 1999; Johnson & Ward, 2001; Maynard & Almarzouqi, 2006), and the tutors’ learning experience and academic achievement (Topping, 1996; Houston & Lazenbatt, 1999; Saunders, 2002; Sobral, 2002; Maynard & Almarzouqi, 2006). In a review of literature, Ward, Smith, Makasci, and Crouch (1998) concluded that peer tutoring is an effective instructional strategy especially for students learning and developing new skills. More recently, a review by Ward and Lee (2005) concluded that peer assisted learning is especially effective in the development of new skills, with peer tutoring in physical education commonly demonstrating enhanced learning and achievement.

Peer tutoring has been found to result in improved transferable skills and better degree assessment outcome for tutees (Topping et al., 1997). Houston and Lazenbatt (1999) also found that tutees achieve higher grades in the subjects that they were tutored in. More specifically Johnson and Ward (2001) found that physical education students achieved greater success in practical activities and new skill development when feedback and tutoring was provided by their peers. Most peer tutoring studies have found higher levels of achievement in tutors and tutees (Topping, 1996; Houston & Lazenbatt, 1999; Sobral, 2002; Saunders, 2002; Maynard & Almarzouqi, 2006). Sobral (2002) also noted that peer tutors with a higher academic achievement are preferentially selected as tutors. This is especially relevant in the development of new skills and competencies in a practical environment as D’Arripe-Longueville, Gernigon, Huet, Cadopi, and Winnykamen (2002) found that higher skill levels in physical education tutors resulted in tutees setting themselves higher goals and increasing levels of participation in practical activities, with a resultant increase in achievement by tutees. It therefore appears that to enhance the potential benefits of peer tutoring, it is essential that both tutors and tutees receive some training regarding their individual roles, and what their expectations should be.

Peer tutoring has been shown to be highly effective in enhancing both tutor and tutee achievements and skill development (Topping, 1996; Topping et al., 1997; Houston & Lazenbatt, 1999; Johnson & Ward, 2001; Saunders, 2002; Sobral, 2002; Maynard & Almarzouqi, 2006), especially in a physical education and coaching setting (Johnson & Ward, 2001; D’Arripe-Longueville et al., 2002; Legrain, D’Arripe-Longueville, & Gernigon, 2003). However, no literature appears to be available regarding undergraduate applied sports science students. As many of the practical competencies are highly skill based and require the development of not only physical skill development, but also the ability to coach complex activities proficiently. This requires many hours of study, practice and refinement, however, a large percentage of this study is usually independent of structured feedback and can lead to unsatisfactory progress. It is therefore hypothesised that peer tutoring in this area will noticeably enhance the skills and competencies of tutees.

Aim: To determine if peer tutoring enhances academic achievement and competency level of tutees, on an undergraduate applied sports science programme.

# Method

Undergraduate $3 ^ { \mathrm { r d } }$ year applied sports science students acted as peer tutors for $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ year applied sports science students during optional practical sessions, twice per week for up to two hours per session, for a period of eight weeks, in addition to ‘normal’ timetabled practical sessions.

The peer tutored sessions focussed on developing the students’ individual ability to both perform and coach a range of strength and power based exercises, including the Olympic lifts, in preparation for the practical assessment. The tutors’ primary role was to ensure that the tutees could coach others in the performance of specific exercises along with coaching the tutees individual ability to perform the exercises (although individual performance of the exercises was not assessed). There was also a qualified strength and conditioning coach present, to assist the tutors during the tutorial sessions as Maynard and Almarzouqi (2006) found that peer tutors cannot always offer appropriate assistance and therefore require additional support themselves.

The peer tutoring sessions were not compulsory, resulting in two groups for the comparison of achievement at the end of the study. This approach was adopted as Colvin (2007) found that not all students adopt offered peer tutoring. Students in Groups 1 and 2 were all of a comparable level, based on similar, but less complex, practical assessment grades achieved from a previously studied module. The grades and level of competency of $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ year tutees (Group 1; $n { = } 1 2$ ) were compared to the students that did not attend the peer tutoring (Group 2; $n { = } 1 6$ ), and also compared to the grades of students from the previous year (non-peer tutored) (Group 3; $n { = } 2 4$ ). All peer tutored students (Group 1) attended a minimum of 12 of the 16 optional peer tutoring sessions; whereas the non-peer tutored students (Group 2) did not attend any of the optional sessions.

Prior to the commencement of the peer tutoring program both tutees and tutors were briefed on their own, and each other’s roles, responsibilities and expectations clarified to facilitate the programme and help to prevent any hierarchical struggle (Calvin, 2007). The tutors’ primary role was to ensure that the tutees’ could coach others in the performance of specific exercises via providing positive reinforcement, technical correction and demonstration of good practice while coaching the tutees’ individual ability to perform the exercises.

Students were assessed at the end of the semester, with the two assessors blinded as to who attended the peer tutoring sessions.

# Statistical analysis

The grades of each group were compared via a one way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post hoc analysis (using SPSS version 17), after testing for normal distribution within each group. Apriori level of significance was set at $p { < } 0 . 0 5$ .

# Results

Homogeneity of variance $( p { = } 0 . 1 7 9 $ ) revealed that the grades achieved were normally distributed. Analysis of variance demonstrated a significant difference $\scriptstyle ( p = 0 . 0 0 3 )$ between groups. Post hoc analysis revealed that peer tutoring (Group 1) resulted in significantly higher grades $7 5 . 0 0 { \pm } 1 0 . 5 8 \% )$ compared to Group 2 $5 1 . 8 1 { \pm } 1 8 . 4 9 $ ; $\scriptstyle { p = 0 . 0 0 3 }$ ) and Group 3 $5 9 . 4 8 { \pm } 1 9 . 2 1$ ; $\scriptstyle { p = 0 . 0 1 4 }$ ) (Figure 1).

# Discussion

Results demonstrated significantly higher grades in the students that were peer tutored (Group 1: $7 5 . 0 0 { \pm } 1 0 . 5 8 \% )$ compared to both students from the same cohort that were not peer tutored (Group 2: $5 1 . 8 1 { \pm } 1 8 . 4 9$ , $\scriptstyle { p = 0 . 0 0 3 }$ ) and students from the previous year’s cohort that were not peer tutored (Group 3: $5 9 . 4 8 { \pm } 1 9 . 2 1 $ , $\scriptstyle { p = 0 . 0 1 4 }$ ).

These results are in line with previous research that has also demonstrated that peer tutoring results in improved transferable skills and higher grades for tutees (Topping et al., 1997; Houston & Lazenbatt, 1999; Sobral, 2002; Saunders, 2002; Maynard & Almarzouqi, 2006). More specifically, these findings are also comparable to the results of Johnson and Ward (2001) who found that physical education students achieved greater success in practical activities and new skill development when feedback and tutoring was provided by their peers.

These findings have significant implications in terms of the development of practical skills and competencies that assist in the employability of students, especially within applied and practical areas of employment such as sports science and strength and conditioning. Many of the practical competencies in these areas are highly skill based and require the development of not only individual physical skill, but also the ability to coach complex activities; proficiency in these areas takes many hours of study, practice and refinement. A large percentage of study during undergraduate degree programmes is usually independent and self directed and as a result is usually independent of structured feedback which can lead to unsatisfactory progress. However, the results of this study demonstrate that peer tutors may effectively address this and enhance the achievement of the tutees during practical assessments.

A limitation of this investigation was that the affect of tutoring on achievement of the tutors’ could not be assessed, as the tutors consisted of a whole cohort of students, therefore no comparable data was available. Further research should therefore investigate the effects of peer tutoring on the achievement of tutors as well as the effect on the achievement of the tutees. A further limitation of this research is that as the sessions were optional the more conscientious and harder working students may have been the students that undertook the additional sessions. However, by comparing the achievements of these students (Group 1) to the achievement of students from a previous year (Group 3) this should have been accounted for. Irrespective of any selection bias, student achievement was noticeably higher in all students that took part in the peer tutored sessions (Group 1).

# Conclusion

This study demonstrates that peer tutoring during practical sessions on applied sports science programmes can enhance the achievement of tutees during practical assessments. Therefore, it is recommended that to enhance the achievements of students in applied practical assessment, peer tutoring, and using competent peer tutors, is implemented more widely in the higher education setting.
