# Abstract

The notion of prosody in linguistics was originally applied to phonology by Firth (Palmer, 1970) to refer to non-segmental features. Its use has been extended in Systemic Functional Linguistic theory to the levels of grammar and discourse semantics. Here it refers to the way that interpersonal meaning spreads or diffuses across clauses and across longer phases of discourse (Halliday, 1994; Martin, 1992, 1996). In this paper I explore how the notion of prosodies of interpersonal meaning can inform our understanding of the construction of evaluative stance in the introductions to academic research papers. I draw initially on Appraisal theory (Martin, 2000) and Martin & Rose (2003) to analyse expressions of ATTITUDE1 and GRADUATION. I then consider how such expressions are used in constructing different kinds of argument, with a particular focus on the prosodies of value that are established. An appreciation of the prosodic patterning of interpersonal meanings and an understanding of how they function in academic discourse, have important implications in the modelling of evaluative stance in texts in the teaching of English for Academic Purposes. There are also broader implications for discourse analytic research in terms of methods of coding values and of justifying coding decisions.

# 1. Introduction

There is now an extensive body of work in EAP that focuses on aspects of the interpersonal nature of the discourse. This includes well known work on the genres of academic writing as argument (e.g., Bazerman, 1994; Dudley-Evans, 1994; Swales, 1990), studies that document the evaluative meanings realised in specific lexical choices (e.g., Myers, 1996; Stubbs, 1996), grammatical choices (Conrad & Biber, 2000; Stubbs, 1996; Thompson & Ye, 1991), and discourse level choices (e.g., Hunston, 1995; Koutsantoni, 2004; Mauranen, 1996; Nwogu, 1997; Thompson & Zhou, 2000), as well as the extensive literature from pragmatics on hedging (e.g., Hyland, 1994, 1998). The intention of the study is to complement the contributions of this growing body of work by considering the dynamic interplay of evaluative resources in the construction of prosodies of value that extend across phases of discourse.

Prosodies of interpersonal meaning are variously described as the spread, sprawl, smear or diffusion of interpersonal meanings that accumulate, reinforce, or resonate with each other to construct an evaluative “key” over an extended segment of text (Halliday & Matthiessen, 1999; Lemke, 1998; Martin, 1992; Martin & Rose, 2003; Thompson, 1998; c.f. Macken-Horarik, 2003; Poynton, 1996; Rothery & Stenglin, 2000). The fact that interpersonal meaning resists being confined categorically (in the way in which experiential meaning is categorically bounded), makes for a certain indefiniteness in analytic coding. The analyst is faced with the question of what to take as an instance of encoded value, and how then to explain and justify the impact beyond the instance. An appreciation of the functioning of prosodies of interpersonal meaning makes an important contribution to our understanding the ways in which writers do persuasive work, especially in the context of discourse that relies minimally on overt and explicit attitude. In this study I draw on a small set of introductions to published research articles in the fields of education and applied linguistics. I explore how prosodies of attitude function in the construction of arguments as writers establish space for the creation of new knowledge. I begin by considering how patterns of ATTITUDE correspond to different kinds of arguments, and then attend more closely to the means by which attitudinal meanings radiate out from any explicit expression of ATTITUDE. I refer to prosodies as the ‘radiation’ of interpersonal meaning (C. Cleirigh & J. Martin, personal communication) to capture the sense of multidimensional influence both forward and backwards in the text as well as outwards from the text in engaging the reader (c.f. Lemke, 1998 on propagation of values).

# 2. A theoretical framework for analysing expressions of attitude

Analyses of ATTITUDE are made with reference to APPRAISAL theory (Martin, 1997, 2000; Martin & Rose, 2003). Kinds of ATTITUDE with examples and brief explanations are represented in Fig. 1.

![](img/93275844a2c9fe3ce38a3aff5565156e5dc2aa002e5f5de16b383521bae4116b.jpg)  
Fig. 1. The system of ATTITUDE.

Instances of inscribed ATTITUDE are identified as encoding an explicit positive or negative value that is gradable (e.g., good/very good). Attitudinal terms may express AFFECT, that is, they may describe feelings or emotions (e.g., satisfied). Alternatively they may encode APPRECIATION as the valuing of things (e.g., important), or JUDGEMENT in appraising people and their behaviour (e.g., ethical). In terms of exploring the ways in which values are radiated beyond the instance of attitudinal inscription, the concept of grading needs to be taken into account. We can anticipate, for example, that where values are graded up, the inscription of attitude is likely to have greater radiated impact. So the choice of very important rather than important in describing another study would be noted in analyses of ATTITUDE.

The grading of meanings is represented in Appraisal theory as the realm of GRADUATION (see Fig. 2). GRADUATION presents options for scaling meanings as either FORCE or FOCUS. The example given above of important–very important represents scaling as FORCE, with the quality of “important-ness” being intensified. Where values are represented as nominalised entities, such as in importance, scaling up in FORCE is done through quantifying the meaning, as in more/much importance. Values encoded in or around processes can also be graded as in rigorously explored. GRADUATION of this kind is referred to as enhancement.

While the examples above illustrate the grading up of attitudinal meanings ( $\mathrm { a s } + \mathrm { F O R C E } )$ , other non-attitudinal (experiential) meanings can also be graded (see Fig. 2). For example, entities such as the subjects in a research study can be graded in amount (e.g., the study involved a small number of subject—the study involved a large number of subjects), or the implications from a study may be graded in scope (e.g., it has had a pervasive influence), or a study may be graded in proximity in time (e.g., a more recent study). Processes can also be graded in frequency (such studies frequently report that .). In grading experiential meanings in this way the writer encodes a subjective slant and so the GRADUATION functions to evoke or ‘flag (Hood & Martin, 2005) an attitudinal reading.

Fig. 2. Network of options in GRADUATION showing instances of the grading of experiential meanings.

The other dimension of GRADUATION, that of FOCUS, has to do with the sharpening or softening of boundaries around categorical meanings. So a categorical boundary around an abstract entity such as research can be sharpened by referring to it as real research, or softened as sort of research. The categorical boundaries around processes can be softened by encoding a lack of completion or realisation as in tried to show, or possibly shows. Once again the grading of non-attitudinal (experiential meanings) encodes a subjective positioning on behalf of the writer, and hence an indication to the reader to interpret attitudinally.

In the following section I explore the interplay of ATTITUDE and GRADUATION in generating and maintaining prosodies of value in the arguments constructed by writers in the introductions to published research papers.

# 3. The role of prosodies of value in relation to different kinds of argument

In the process of establishing space for their own contribution to knowledge through research, academic research writers typically include one or more of three broad kinds of argument: they argue that their object of study, that is their research topic, is worthy of investigation; they argue that knowledge of this object of study is unresolved; and they argue that their own contribution to knowledge is of value. (See, for example, Swales’ CARS model for research paper introductions for corresponding notions, 1990, p. 141). In this section I consider examples of each kind of argument to explore how they rely differently on resources for expressing attitude, how different kinds of prosodies are at work.

# 3.1. Arguing for your object of study

Extract [1] represents a phase in the opening section of a research report in which the writer describes the field or object of study of the research. There are multiple instances of explicit or inscribed ATTITUDE, in this case expressing negative emotions or AFFECT (frustration, dissatisfied, concerned, opposed) and negative APPRECIATION of the circumstances (e.g., demanding, cramped, lack of autonomy). These are coded in bold.

[1] A study by Richards, Tung and $\mathrm { N g }$ (1992) characterises teachers in Hong Kong as professionals who feel under-consulted about issues of curriculum and policy. They teach large classes with few resources within demanding curriculum constraints, have considerable amounts of marking and school meetings, and often work in very cramped conditions (p. 97). Richards, Tung and $\mathrm { N g }$ (1992) also report that teachers appear to be dissatisfied with their lack of autonomy. An example of this frustration can be seen in the perception that teachers are insufficiently consulted about recent government moves such as the introduction of the new curriculum (.) Similarly, the implementation of benchmarks for Hong Kong’s secondary and primary school teachers is another top-down, government led initiative which has been vehemently opposed by the local teachers’ union, as many teachers feel concerned about what they see as a challenge to their professionalism.

From a static perspective each instance of explicit ATTITUDE can be seen to appraise a specific phenomenon. From a dynamic perspective the multiple instances accumulate and resonate one with the other as the text unfolds to colour the whole phase of discourse as strongly negative. Each new instance picks up the values previously encoded, reinforces them and spreads them further. The prosody of negative values is reinforced and amplified not only through multiple instances of inscribed ATTITUDE, but also because some of these instances are themselves amplified through resources of GRADUATION (italicised). In the context of the introduction to a research paper, the rhetorical effect is to construct the object of study as one that is significantly problematic, with the implication that it is thus a worthy context for research.

While it is common for the object of study to be valued negatively and established as problematic in some sense, this is not always the rhetorical strategy employed. In [2] for example, the writer argues the worthiness of her object of study (peer review in writing pedagogy) on the grounds of claimed benefits. There is a resonance of positive attitude across the text, strengthened through a multiplicity of amplified instances, this time of positive Appreciation (better, positive) and positive JUDGEMENT (independence, confidence). The argument is essentially that the object of study is worthy of further study because it is so beneficial.

[2] Peer reviews also provide opportunities for collaborative learning. Students in pairs or small groups can pool ideas, and it is through interacting with others that students learn and develop (Vygotsky, 1978). Students learned to become more autonomous writers as they are prepared to write without the help of the teacher (Jacobs, 1999). Through collaborative learning, students can gain a better understanding of their peers’ difficulties in writing, and as a result they may gain more confidence in themselves (Mittan, 1989).

Peer reviews can boost confidence, make writing a more positive learning activity, and help students develop greater independence in writing.(.)

In [1] and [2] the heightened attitudinal values radiate out from the phases of text, functioning to compel readers to align with the writer’s choice of object of study. Where such arguments are made, they frequently constitute the opening section of an introduction, perhaps subtitled as “background” or “rationale.”

# 3.2. Arguing a need for new knowledge

A second kind of argument is one in which the writer appraises other relevant research, towards establishing that knowledge to date is unresolved, and hence that there is a ‘gap’ (Swales, 1990) for the creation of new knowledge. In the process of constructing this kind of argument, some studies may be singled out as having particular relevance for the writer’s own research. Extract [3] provides an example a phase of discourse functioning in this way.

[3] His methodology showed certain other refinements. First, he excluded overseas students. Such students tend to be older than average and also to fare worse academically (Woodley, 1979), thus influencing any age/performance relationship. (.) Secondly, he used two measures of performance; the proportion leaving without obtaining a degree and the degree results of those taking final examinations. Finally he weighted the degree class obtained according to its rarity value in each faculty.

In [3] a positive prosody is initiated with inscribed APPRECIATION in refinements. The positive value radiates beyond this inscription to colour the subsequent phase of text even though there is no further explicit evaluation by the writer. As a consequence we are led to read excluded overseas students and used two measures of performance as positive things to do. A similar strategy is evident in [4]. The phase of text begins with the encoding of minimal inscribed positive APPRECIATION of another study (intensive), that functions to give a positive colouring to the subsequent description of the study without further instances of inscribed ATTITUDE.

[4] Green’s recent intensive study of ten students and their literacy experiences during the Year 6/Year 7 transition (Green, 1997) has more in common with the methodological perspectives of the present project. (.) Green’s study offers a case study exploration of the experiences of ten different students, and in doing so moves on from narrowly defined ‘literacy practices’ to uncover a number of broader issues which make up these students’ school literacy experiences, particularly peer relations, friendship, bullying, and homework.

In [3] and [4] each writer initiates a positive evaluation of the other study with explicit positive APPRECIATION. A positive stance radiates out from this instance encouraging the reader to align positively with the contribution of the other study. A reliance on the radiation of positive stance from an initial instance enables the rest of the descriptive commentary to be construed as providing ‘objective’ experiential information. In this sense the attitudinal work is done implicitly. In both [3] and [4] the lack of further explicit attitude beyond the initial instance means that the impact of the positive prosody reduces across the phase, and this enables the writer to shift values at an appropriate point. While the particular study is viewed as a positive contribution, the writer still needs to establish that knowledge of the object of study is unresolved. To do so, the writer must encourage the reader to dis-align with the appraised study, in order to open space for her/his own research.

The disruption of a prosody typically involves some counter-expectancy marker such as a concessive conjunction (c.f. Nwogu, 1997; Thompson & Zhou, 2000). In example [3.1] below the writer signals a shift in prosody through resources of counter-expectation (but, only), as well as explicit negation (not), and also by flagging negative appreciation in the downgraded quantity (small numbers).

[3.1] His methodology showed certain other refinements. First, he excluded overseas students. Such students tend to be older than average and also to fare worse academically (Woodley, 1979), thus influencing any age/performance relationship. (.) Secondly, he used two measures of performance; the proportion leaving without obtaining a degree and the degree results of those taking final examinations. Finally he weighted the degree class obtained according to its rarity value in each faculty. (.) Several other differences were noted but they did not achieve statistical significance due to the small numbers involved. The mature student sample only contained thirty-three women, twenty-six science students and thirty-seven aged over thirty.

# 3.3. Arguing for one’s own contribution

Before I focus in more detail on how these prosodies are “propagated” (Lemke, 1998), I want to consider a third kind of argument, and that is the argument the writer makes for their own study as a positive contribution to research in the field. Typically this represents the transition stage from the introduction to a discussion of the writer’s own research methodology. It is here that the writer positions her/his own contribution in relation to other research that has been reviewed. Arguments of this kind may rely on evaluations of a range of aspects of the writer’s study—from features of methodology, to the effort employed in the research, to the value of the findings. The focus of the appraisal may to some extent determine the way ATTITUDE is employed. When writers evaluate the anticipated implications of the study, more explicit APPRECIATION is anticipated, as in bold in [5].

[5] The aim of this paper is to present a description of discourse in the specific genre of MBA seminar classes. Such description can be of value to EAP course designers. (.) Moreover, course designers in other social studies areas and disciplines may find the description useful .

When writers appraise their own methodology, a different picture frequently emerges. In extract [6] there are no instances of inscribed ATTITUDE, yet the reader is encouraged to take a valued stance towards the writer’s contribution. How is this managed?

[6] The aim of the present study was to extend Walker’s work to all British universities so that these and other relationships could be tested out on a much larger sample of mature students.

If we return to the earlier discussion of GRADUATION, we find multiple instances of GRADUATION (italicised) in the short phase of discourse. Each functions to amplify experiential meanings in terms of quantity as $^ +$ amount (all, much larger) or quantity as $^ +$ extent (extend). The underlying assumption is that, in terms of methodology, more is better. So while there is no explicit positive evaluation of the writer’s study, a positive prosody is created through multiple encodings of GRADUATION as $^ +$ quantity. The writer establishes a positive stance by implication.

In the discussion to this point we have considered three kinds of argument employed by academic research writers within in the genre of research paper introductions. Examples of each have been used to illustrate how writers tend to draw differently on resources of ATTITUDE and GRADUATION depending on the kind of argument they are constructing. The resultant prosodies of value function to appraise different phenomena, and vary in their strength and persuasive impact. In the examples in [1] and [2] the writers argue that their object of study is worthy of investigation. Here, multiple inscriptions of explicit ATTITUDE reinforce each other and intensify the value across the phase of text, compelling the reader to align with the writer around the significance of the object of study. A second strategy, evident in [3] and [4], is to establish that knowledge of the object of study remains unresolved in spite of positive contributions from other studies. Expressions of explicit ATTITUDE are minimal, typically restricted to some initial encoding that radiates beyond the instance but with diminishing effect, until a disjunctive marker signals a dis-alignment (Hood, 2004). This strategy enables a foregrounding of objective description while maintaining the flow of evaluative stance. The third strategy is for the writer to positively evaluate their own contribution; in Swales’ terms they make a move to “occupy the niche” (1990, p. 141). The strategy used varies with the focus of the self-appraisal. Extract [6] illustrates how a positive evaluative stance towards the writer’s methodology is established without any explicit ATTITUDE. Multiple encodings of GRADUATION accumulate over a phase of discourse to maintain an implication of positive value. Once again the discourse remains overtly ‘objective’.

# 4. The means by which prosodies function

In this section I focus more closely on the mechanisms by which prosodies radiate out from instances of explicit attitude. An understanding of how prosodies are maintained across phases of text is important in arguing for particular analyses of interpersonal meaning in texts, and for explicating the evaluative nature of academic argument for novice writers. Lemke (1998) refers to the mechanisms of prosody formation as “propagation.” He suggests that we consider propagation as functioning at clause level in grammatical connections, in relationships of projection in a clause complex, in cohesive links, and across longer phases of text.

# 4.1. Prosodies in the clause

At the clause level we can see values spreading in grammatical relationships. In [7], for example, the positive value attributed to the head noun in a nominal group (opportunities) propagates across to the noun group in the post-modifying phrase (collaborative learning), encouraging us to read collaborative learning as positive.

[7] Peer reviews also provide opportunities for collaborative learning.

We see another example of a grammatically propagated prosody at clause level in [8], although this time functioning retrospectively. The results are positively valued as not distorted and this propagates retrospectively around the process (meant that) to the cause, the timing.

[8] the timing meant that the results were not distorted by any [this] factor.

# 4.2. Prosodies across a clause-complex

We can also consider the propagation of values at the level of clause complex. Lemke (1998) suggests, for example, that explicitly naming an intertextually valued sayer increases the value attributed to the projected proposition. So in [9] the sayer, Vygotsky, could be expected intertextually to encode a high positive value. The proposition (in this case textually but not grammatically) projected by this source then takes up the positive value of the sayer.

[9] Students in pairs or small groups can pool ideas, and it is through interacting with others that students learn and develop (Vygotsky, 1978).

The choice of projecting process itself can also function in this way. So, for example, in [10], showed represents an instance of grading a process in terms of fulfilment, in contrast, say, to claims or suggests (Hood & Martin, 2005; c.f. Thompson & Ye, 1991, and Hunston, 1995 on reporting verbs). Here the GRADUATION as fulfilment flags a positive reading of the projected proposition. We can also consider a simultaneous retrospective propagation of positive value to the sayer, Sanders.

[10] Sanders (1961) showed that the university success rate fell until the age of twenty or twenty-one .

# 4.3. Prosodies in longer phases of discourse

We can move beyond the clause complex to consider how values radiate across longer stretches of text. In [11] a positive prosody is initiated in the inscribed APPRECIATION in intensive together with the positive APPRECIATION flagged in recent. This is reinforced in multiple instances of GRADUATION that amplify quantity as amount and scope (more, moves on from narrowly, ten different, a number of, broader), and as enhancement (exploration). However, there is also a brief shift in value signalled by the underlined concessive conjunction, though, that intrudes into the overall prosody (see the boxed segment).

[11] Green’s recent intensive study of ten students and their literacy experiences during the Year 6/Year 7 transition (Green, 1997) has more in common with the methodological perspectives of the present project,

though it was smaller in scale, focused on a particular dimension (literacy), and not offering the comparative and (eventual) longitudinal scope of the 12 to 18 Project.

Green’s study offers a case study exploration of the experiences of ten different students, and in doing so moves on from narrowly defined ‘literacy practices’ to uncover a number of broader issues which make up these students’ school literacy experiences, particularly peer relations, friendship, bullying, and homework.

In academic writing the resource for interrupting a prosodic domain is frequently a concessive conjunctions such as however, (al)though or but. The concession signals a shift in the prosodic “key” (Martin & Rose, 2003) and functions to encourage a change in the way in which we, as readers, are encouraged to align with a proposition or a phenomenon. The strong cohesive link of lexical repetition in [11] in Green’s recent intensive study and Green’s study signals a return to the initial positive prosody beyond the boxed segment. The overall rhetorical strategy is to align the reader with Green’s study, and hence with the writer’s research to the extent that there are features in common. At the same time, the brief intrusion of contrasting value (boxed text) creates a degree of distance that gives space for the writer’s own study.

In [12] we see the propagation of a value along a cohesive chain (Lemke, 1998, p. 50) that begins with the nominalised, attitudinally enhanced process (refined–refinements) of doing the research. Subsequent references to the research process (underlined) are read as kinds of refinement.

[12] His methodology showed certain other refinements. First, he excluded overseas students. Such students tend to be older than average and also to fare worse academically (Woodley, 1979), thus influencing any age/performance relationship. Secondly, he used two measures of performance; the proportion leaving without obtaining a degree and the degree results of those taking final examinations. Finally, he weighted the degree class obtained according to its rarity value in each faculty.

The strong lexico-semantic connections across the phase carry the ATTITUDE along. The power of the prosody to colour the text along these cohesive links can be illuminated if we remove the value inscribed in refinements, as in [12.1]. We no longer have any indication of how to read the writer’s stance.

[12.1] His methodology was as follows. First, he excluded overseas students. (.) Secondly, he used two measures of performance. (.) Finally, he weighted the degree class obtained according to its rarity value in each faculty.

If we replace the inscribed positive APPRECIATION with a negative value, as in [12.2], we again see the prosody spread to the same terms, but this time colouring them negatively.

[12.2] There are certain problems associated with his methodology. First, he excluded overseas students. Such students tend to be older than average and also to fare worse academically (Woodley, 1979), thus influencing any age/performance relationship. Secondly, he used two measures of performance; the proportion leaving without obtaining a degree and the degree results of those taking final examinations. Finally, he weighted the degree class obtained according to its rarity value in each faculty.

In terms of cohesive links, Lemke (1998, p. 50) suggests that evaluative meanings can also create cohesive links. In [13] we see that the evaluative choices themselves function to construct cohesive links. There are no instances of explicit ATTITUDE, but a number of instances of GRADUATION that represent quantity as either $^ +$ scope or $^ +$ amount. All function to evoke positive APPRECIATION. The repetition and/or consistency of values in multiple instances propagate a cohesive attitudinal stance across the whole clause complex, and as each instance of evoked ATTITUDE is overlaid onto the next, the value construed across the clause complex is more than the value of any one instance. The linked elements are underlined.

[13] Exposing $[ +$ scope] student writers to readers, who are their fellow students not only broadens $[ +$ scope] the audience, but helps develop $[ +$ quantity] their critical thinking skills—both $[ +$ quantity] as readers and writers.

Finally we need to consider the textual placement of attitudinal meanings as facilitating the radiation of values. Lemke (1998) loosely describes extended prospective and retrospective evaluation, but to provide a more detailed explanation of this process we need to consider the periodic structuring of discourse in higher-level Themes and News (Martin, 1992) and in particular how this functions in relation to attitudinal meanings (Coffin & Hewings, 2004). Hyper-Themes and macro-Themes function to predict forward over a subsequent phase of discourse, while hyper-News and macro-News orient the reader retrospectively to consolidate meanings across a phase (Martin & Rose, 2003). We have seen in [3] and [4], examples of this strategic placement of explicit ATTITUDE in points of textual prominence, in these cases in hyper-Theme position. The predictive functioning of meanings that are so placed functions to support the prosodic spread forward across the subsequent phase of discourse.

# 4.4. Prosodies functioning retrospectively

To this point we have most often explored prosodies that function prospectively, radiating forward in the text, and accumulating as the text unfolds. However we can also find examples in academic texts where the prosody apparently radiates retrospectively across a phase of discourse. In [14] an attitudinal stance, while implied early (traditional) in the phase, is only made explicit in hyper-New position, where it is amplified with multiple instances (more purposeful, meaningful, authentic). Inscribed ATTITUDE is in bold and GRADUATION is italicised. The underlined terms are discussed below

[14] In the traditional classroom, writing is often done in isolation—the students write on their own, hand in the product to the teacher, get written feedback from him or her, and finally put aside the writing. This is followed by another cycle and the pattern persists. Peer review is a technique that reverses such a traditional approach to writing. Students may still start off by writing on their own; however, once the first draft is done, they get their peers to read it and comment on it. Then they revise it, taking into account their peers’ remarks. Writing becomes more purposeful and meaningful as it is read by an authentic audience (Mittan, 1989).

Depending on our reading position, we may or not read the initial reference to traditional (underlined) as explicitly attitudinal, or we may be unsure of the writer’s intention for it to be read as positive or negative. Progressively throughout the phase, however, we are encouraged towards a negative view of the traditional classroom. There is an implicit clue in the grading of ideational meaning in persists, where the implication is of prolonging something negative. But it is not until the culmination of the phase that an explicit position is encoded that confirms and strengthens a negative evaluation of the traditional classroom.

# 5. Conclusion

In this paper I have demonstrated variations in the prosodic patterning of attitudinal meanings as academic writers employ different kinds of rhetorical strategies in arguing space for their own research. I have highlighted different kinds of attitudinal resources that come into play, and have explored some of the means by which a prosodic spread of ATTITUDE is enabled, especially across phases of discourse. While this is evidently a complex process, an appreciation of the prosodic patterns of interpersonal meaning is important in the effective management of evaluation in academic writing, and so is usefully a part of any modelling or explication of interpersonal meaning in EAP or academic literacy support programs. It represents an important complement to the extensive body of work on the categorical structuring of meanings in academic writing, such as in the identification of more or less discrete stages of genres (e.g., Samraj, 2002; Yang & Allison, 2003), or the evaluative role of discrete grammatical structures (e.g., Conrad & Biber, 2000; Thompson & Ye, 1991). It also it extends recent work on the textual organisation of meanings in academic texts (e.g., Coffin, 2004; Coffin & Hewings, 2004; Ravelli, 2004) by focusing on the interaction of the textual with the interpersonal.

I conclude with suggestions for two strategies that might be used in alerting novice academic writers to the prosodic patterning of evaluative stance in academic discourse, and in helping them to manage more effectively the construction of stance in their own texts. The first picks up on the metaphor of colour that has been used earlier in this paper to refer to a spread of value. The use of contrasting colour to code positive and negative values serves at least two functions. It makes readily apparent the ways in which different stages of the introduction rely differently on explicit expressions of ATTITUDE. In other words it allows us to see at a glance the phases of text where the most compelling arguments are made, and those where the evaluative work is done less explicitly. It also functions to highlight shifts in alignment, such as those that occur around concessive conjunctions. By grading the intensity of colour, we can also visually represent values as inscribed (high intensity of colour) or as implied, for example, through resources of GRADUATION (lower intensity of colour). Their role in extending prosodies of value can become more evident. Ideally we might also employ the resources of information technology to reflect the dynamic shifting in evaluative colour as texts unfold in the reading of them and preferred reader alignments are adjusted and managed by the writer.

A second recommended strategies is to demonstrate to, and engage novice writers in manipulating the values encoded in texts, as was done for example in [12], [12.1] and [12.2] above. This might be done on drafts of their own writing or on published texts. They can discuss the impact of deleting or inserting explicit evaluative terms. They can similarly manipulate instances of GRADUATION, adding or diminishing FORCE or sharpening or softening

FOCUS. They can also shift the location of evaluative resources into or out of positions of textual prominence, that is, into or out of hyper- or macro-Theme.

While this paper focuses specifically on prosodies of ATTITUDE in academic discourse, the arguments presented here also have relevance to discourse analytic studies of evaluation in other registers of language, in that they model the need to account both for instances of inscription of ATTITUDE as well as explanations for how valued radiate beyond the instance to colour nonattitudinal meanings.
