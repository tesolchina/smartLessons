This quasi-experimental classroom-based study $\ l ( \ l _ { \Pi } ~ = ~ 1 2 8 )$ assessed how individual writing developed after students had completed either collaborative or independent writing; specifically looking at the development of language use in writing and changes in the complexity, accuracy and fluency of individual writing completed before and after either collaborative or independent writing had been carried out. While the complexity and fluency of individual writing changed in a similar way after collaborative or independent writing had been completed, analysis of pre and post-test writing revealed that accuracy increased by a significantly greater degree in the post-test writing of learners who carried out collaborative writing $\mathbf { ( n = 6 4 } ,$ . This suggests that students may be able to learn about correct language use from writing collaboratively with their peers.

# 1. Introduction

In second language (L2) writing and English for Academic Purposes programs (EAP), learners primarily write independently (Bhowmik, Hilman & Roy, 2019). In doing so, students can learn about correct language use through written feeback provided by their intructors. This provides them with a context to learn about how language is used in writing. However, i is also possble that students could learn about how language is used in text from writing collaboratively with their peers, which in turn may lead to the development of their own subsequent individual writing. While writing is often considered to be a solitary activity, collaborative writing is a proces where participants work together and interact throughout the writing process,contributing to the planning, generation of ideas, deliberations about the text structure, and editing and revision (Storch, 2013). This interaction allows leaners to deliberate about language use and about other aspects of written discourse (see Dobao, 2012; Storch, 2005; Storch & Wigglesworth, 2007; Wiggesworth & Storch, 2009) and potentially provides L2 students with opportunities t learn that are not provided by independent writing.

To date, the majorit of studies that have loked at the effect of completing fae-to-face collaborative writing in L2 have examined the differences between writing that was produced collaboratively (by two or more learners and writing produced by individuals (see Dobao, 2012; McDonough, De Vleschauwer & Crawford, 2018; Storch & Wigglesworth, 2007; Villrreal & Gil-Sarratea, 2019; Wigglesworth & Storch, 2009). These sudies focused on the linguistic featres of writing rather than on rhetorical aspects of text. They assessed the complexity, accuracy and fluency of the writing that was produce, and found differences between writing produced collaboratively and writing produced by individual learners; collctively finding that writing produced by pairs or groups of students was more accurate. The results of these studieseem to sugest that ollaboration may allow students to correct language use in their writing. However, they do not demonstrat that the learners who took part i collaborative writing had actuall learned to produce more accurate writing themselves, or that their own subsequent individual writing would become more accurate as a result. To determine this, it i necessary to look at the development of language use in individual writing after collaborative writing has been carried out and compare this to changes in individual writing produced after independent writing has been completed.

To address this, the present study looked at the development of language use in individual writing and at how the complexity, accuracy and fluency of L2 student writing change after completing either collaborative or independent writing. This comparison allows us to draw a number of different conclusions relating to collaboration and its impact on language use in writig. Also, Skehan (2009) has noted that changes in one area of language use may potntially have negative effect on others,sousing a set of measures that assess ifferent aspects of language, such as CAF, can provide a very detaild picture of possible changes in language use. For example, if complext increases afer completig collaborative writing, we can also determin f this reults in decreases in acuracy or fluency. Additionally,assessing CAF in individual writingallows us to highlight possible paralls between the present study and previous rearch that can help us to understand how collaboration affet language use in writig. For example, if there are more pronounced increases in accuracy in individual writing after collaborative writing has been completed, it may be possible to conclude that collaborative writing not only allows learners to correct language use in their co-authored text (as ilstrated in the research previously discussed), but also allows students to learn about correct language use.

To date, only a limited number of studies have compared changes in individual writing completed before and after either collaborative or independent writing have been carried out. Most of these focused on changes in the rating of different aspects f text, such as the content, organization, and mechanics of individual writing (see Bikowski & Vithanage, 2016; Khatib & Meihami, 2015; Shehadeh, 2011). These studies also rated the use of grammar and vocabulary in writing, but did not provide detailed information about language use. To my knowledge, only one study conducted by Hsu and Lo (2018) partiall assessed changes in CAF in individual writing afer collaborative or independent writing had been completed, but did not asses changes in measures of fluency. This study also looked at the effect of completing computer-mediated collaboratie writing rather than collaborative writing that was completed face-to-face. Rouhshad, Wigglesworth & Storch (2016) have highlighted notable diffrences between online and faceto-face inter action and thus we cannot be sure that the differences noted in individual writing in the study completed by Hsu & Lo (2018) would be the same as those noted after face-to-face collaborative writing had been carried out. Accordingly, research is needed to fully ses how the CAF of individual writing change after students complete face-to-face collaborative writing or write independently. To address this gap, and to fully examine how language develops in individual writig afer completing either face-to-face collaborative writing or independent writing, the present, large-scale study $\mathbf { ( n = 1 2 8 ) }$ assessed how CAF in individual writing changed as a result of carrying out collaborative writing, comparing thisto changes in CAF afer completing independent writing under the same conditions and over the same period of time.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Deliberation in collaborative and individual writing

One of the most important differences between collaborative and individual writing relates to how students deliberate about language use while writing. Unlike individual writing, collborative writing is typified by externalized deliberation. Deliberation about writing is external and explicit as each learner's thoughts and understanding about how language should be used in text and about how ideas can be organized and arranged in writing are brought out into the open to be reviewed, questioned, critiqued. explained, or discussed (Storch, 2019). Another characteristic of cllaborative writing i L2 noted in a number of studies (see Dobao, 2012; Storch, 2005; Storch & Wigglesworth, 2007; Wigglesworth & Storch, 2009 is that learners engage i discussions about language use, referred to as language related episodes, or LREs (Swain & Lapkin, 1998). Through these LREs, students can deliberate about different aspects of writing. Storch (2005) suggests that while completing collaborative writing and engaging in LREs, leaners can notice how language is used by their partners as they make proposals for the co-authored text. They can also discuss its use and at the same time can receive continuous feedback about their own language use from the person they write with (Storch, 2013). Herder. Berenst, de Glopper and Koole (2020) stress that collaborative writing provides L2 students with acontext to share knowledge with their peers.

Deliberation about language use and written discourse also occurs in independent writing through each learner's internal, introspective deliberation or what De Guerrero (2018) defines as the individualself-irected inaudible iner speech involved in thinking. However, the self-contained nature of this introspective deliberation means that there may be fewer opportunities for learners to question or re-evaluate the preconceived knowledge that they have when writing independently. Clearly, individual learners can think about different ways to expres ideas in text and mentally review a range of alternaties while writing, but each learner can only rely on their own lingustic resources and existing knowledge (Storch, 2013). On the other hand, peers can present learners with a possibly divergent opinion about how language should be used or about how ideas should be expressed in text, when collaborative writig is completed, which may challenge the learners understanding of language use and provide them with various opportunities to reconsider how language is used.

# 2.2. Studies comparing writing produced collaboratively and independently

The majorit of studies that have assessed the potentia of collaborative writing for L2 learning have looked at how writing that is produced collaboratively (in pairs or groups) diffrs to writing that individuals produce (see Dobao, 2012; McDonough, De Vleeschauwer & Crawford, 2018; Storch & Wigglesworth, 2007; Vilarreal & Gil-Sarratea, 2019; Wigglesworth & Storch, 2009) In these studies, collborative writing is primarily viewed through the lens of the socio-cultural aproach. Viewed through this lens, collaborative writing in L2 has primarily been seen as an activity that can allow students to work together to resolve language issues in writing that normally could not be resolved by each individual learner. For example, by pooling linguistic resources, students may jointly be able to come up with the corrct way to express their ideas in text (Swain, 2000. These studies loked at how writing produced collaboratively by pairs or groups of students differed to writing produced by individuals and compared the CAF of the writing produced. Collctively, they found that writing produced collaboratively tends to be more acurate than writing produced independently. On the other hand, in most of thee studies there was ittl difference in the complexity or fluency of writing produced.

For example, in the studies conducted by Storch & Wigglesworth (2007), Wigglesworth & Storch (2009) and Villarreal & Gil-Sarratea (2019) there were higher levels of accuracy in writing produced collaboratively than in writing produced independently, but no sigificant ifferences in terms of complexity and fluency. When comparing writing produced collaboratively by pairs or groups of learners and writing produced independently, Dobao (2012) noted that writing completed by groups of students was more acurate than writing produced by pairs, and that paired writing was more accurate than individual writing, but there were no notable differences between collaborative and independent texts in terms of complexity and fluency. One different variatio of this pattern was found in a small-cale study caried out by Storch (2005) who found that writing produced collaboratively was more accurate than writing produced independently, but also was more complex. With a slightly different focus, McDonough, De Vleeschauwer & Crawford (2018) examined the writing of three groups of students who had either completed collaborative writing, independent writing, or students who had worked collaboratively during the pre-writing stage (relating to idea generation and planing), but who had completed writing individually. They also found that texts that were produced collaboratively were more accurate than those produced independently or by collaborative rewriting students. McDonough et al. (2018) suggest that the benefit of collaboration for accuracy may only occur during the proces of writing and not during the planning, or brain storming stage prior to writing. The study carried out by McDonough et al. (2018) also did not identif significant differences between measures of fluency for the writing samples of the three groups although they did find independent and collaborative prewriting texts had significantly higher rates of subordination than collaborative writing texts, suggesting that they were more linguistically complex.

The common pattern highlighted by studies that compared writing produced collaboratively to writing produced by individuals (previously outlined) is that writing that is produced collaboratively tends to be more accurate than individual writing. However, from the results of these studies, we cannot be sure that the individual students involved in collaborative writing have learned from this process, or that each learner would be ableto apply what was learned from writing collaboratively to their own work because these studies did not asses the impact that completing collaborative writing can have on the individual writig that learners subsequently produced.

# 2.3. The role of collaborative writing in writing development

A very limited number of studies examined how individual writing changed as a result of completing either collborative or in dependent writing and these asessed both writing completed face-to-face and online. Together these studies revealed more pro nounced improvement in individual writing after collaborative writing had been carried out. However, this small number of studies involved dffrent modes of intraction (Rouhshad, Wiggleworth & Storch, 2016) and used differing mesures to aess writig; thus it is difficult to draw any conclusion from these studies at this stage. The studies conducted by Shehadeh (2011), Khatib and Meihami (2015) and Bikowski and Vithanage (2016)all revealed more pronounced improvement in individual writing afer learners completed collaborative writing than after independent writing had been carried out. These studies used similar analytic rubrics to assess the individual writing of students completed before (pre-test) and after (post-test) either collaborative or independent writing had been carried out to rate the content, organization, grammar, vocabulary, and mechanics of writing produced. Shehadeh (2011) found that there weresignificant differences in the rating of content, organization and vocabulary in the post-test writing of students from the collaborative and independent writing groups, but no diferences in the rating of grammar and mechanics of writing. One possible explanation for the lack of evidence of improvement in the use of grammar provided by Shehadeh (2011) was due to the low proficiency level of the learners taking part in the study (average 3.5-4.0 IELs score) and their inability to effctively discuss the use of grammar with their peers. Using the same rubric employed in the previous study, Khatib and Meihami (2015) found that there were significant differences in the rating of content organization, grammar, vocabulary, and mechanics of individual writing produced afer collaborative or independent writing had been carried out. Using a slightly different form of assessment, a study conducted by Bikowski and Vithanage (2016) looked at how individual writing changed as a result of completing four web-based collaborative or independent writing tasks. Employing a 100-point analytic rubric, which assessed the content, organization, academic style and grammar of the writing produced, these researchers found that there was a significantly greater increase between the pre and post-test writing scores of students from the computer-mediated collaborative writing group than in the same writing of learners who wrote independently.

The only investigation that partilly looked at the CAF of individual writing produced afer students had completed either collaborative or independent writing was conducted by Hsu and Lo (2018). These researchers assessed the content, organization, complexity and accuracy of individual writing produced before (pre-test) and afer (post-test) either computer-mediated collaborative or independent writing had been carried out. They found that there were more pronounced increases in accuracy in the individual post-test writing of students from the online collaborative writing group, but that there were no diffrences between both writing groups in measures of complexity. These researchers also found that the ratings asociated with the content of writing increased by a significantly greater degre between the pre and post-test writing of learners from the computer-mediated collaborative writing group, but that there was not a significant dfference between both groups in the rating of organization. However, as previously mentioned, this study examined computer-mediated collaborative writing (Rouhshad, et al., 2016) and not the face-to-face collaborative writing that is examined in the present study. This rarch also only focused on complexity and accuracy, but did not asessthe fluency of the writing produced.

To fully aess the effect that completing collaborative or independent writing have on the development of language use in individual writing, and to gauge their efect on the complexity, accuracy and fluency of the individual writing that L2 learners subse. quently produce, the following research questions will be addressed in this study:

1. How do complexit, accuracy and fluency change in individual writig after carrying out collaborative or independent writing in a 10-week EAP program?   
2. Do changes in the complexity, accuracy and fluency of individual writing difer afer collaborative or independent writing have been carried out?

# 3. Methods

This study investigated the development of language use in individual writing by comparing changes in the CAF of individual writing completed before (pre-test) and afer (post-test either collaboratie or independent writing had been caried out. This quas. experimental classroom-based study $\mathbf { ( n = 1 2 8 }$ employed a quantitative approach to answer the research questions previously outlined. This research followed a non-equivalent (pre-test and post-test) control-group design (Creswell, 2009) that involved two groups of students; referred to as the collaborative and independent writing groups. Learners from both groups completed an individual pre-test writing activity to establish the baseline inguistic competence of each writer (stge 1). Afterwards, students asigned to the collaborative writing groups completed a series of writing tass collaboratively while learners assigned to the independent writing groups completed these tasks independently (stage 2). At the end of an eight-week period, students from both groups completed an individual post-test writing activity (stage 3). Because this research looked at the changes in individual writing that may result from completing these two writing processes, and not at writig produced collaboratively, the writing produced by pair of erners was not assessed.

# 3.1. Context and participants

The participants in this study were selected because of the high degree of similarity between them. They were allstudents in a university in the United Arab Emirates where English is the medium of instruction. They were Arabic first language speakers and of similar age (19-21). As an entry requirement for the EAP course that they would complete students were required to have an IELTS 6.0-6.5 band score. As a result allof the learners in this study had an upper intermediat level of English proficiency and very similar levels of spoken and written English. Students attended two 80-minute casses each week. Leaners from eight intact class groups were chosen to take part in this study. All of the clas groups were taught by the same instructor (who conducted the prent study). In one semester,four intact class groups took part; in the following semester four additional groups were included. f the four clas groups chosen in each semester, two were randomly chosen to be groups that completed collaborative writing and the others completed writing independently. The data of 128 learners was used with an equal number of students from the collaborative and independent writing groups. Learners were informed about the purpose and nature of the study, and that participation was voluntary, before giving their consent. Table 1 illstrates the number of students whose data was used (by clas group) and the number of leaners that were in each class.

No changes were made to accommodate both writing procedures. Students completed the same series of writing activities as those completed in previous courses and the structure f a normal classaso did not change. In each class there was a 20-minute instruction phase in which the specific writing that learners needed to produce was presented. The focus of this instruction was on composing and not on the use of language in writing. This was followed by a 50-minute writing phase in which students were instructed to complete the task, but not on how they should do this. The final 10-minute rview phase of each class was spent answering questions about the writing activity and reviewing the teaching points covered. The types of writing activities carried out in this study are shown in Table 2. During an 8-week period (stage 2), students forming the collaborative group (classgroups 1,4,6 and 8) completed these writing actvities cllaboratively while learner from the independent group (clas groups 2,3,5 and 7) completed them independently.

Note: student data used $\mathtt { n } = 1 2 8$ , students in the class $\mathbf { n } = 1 8 0$

From week 2 to the end of week 9, students completed 4 descriptive, 6 cause and effect and 6 compare and contrast writing tasks. These tass dealt with common everyday thmes, such as healthy eating, social media, work, et. and therefore students did not need to look up information or use the Intenet to complete these. All texts were hand-written and generally between 200 to 300 words in ength. Each writing activity was completed in one class At the end of each class, writing would be submitted to the instructor who would return the writing sample to students with writte fedback on each in the following lesson. Both learners who completed collaborative writing received a copy of the original script they had produced which contained the same written feedback. This included feedback on language use, and comments on the organization and clarity of the text. Students who wrote individually received a copy of their work with the same type of feedback as their peers.

Learners who wrote collaboratively worked in pairs. They were allowed to choose their own partner and as students tended to sit in the same seat for every class, they generally worked with the same partner throughout. However, when one student was absent, the other would join another pair of learners to make a trio although this was relatively infrequent. A brief explanation was given to students on how collaborative writing would be completed in the introduction leson (clas 1), but they did not rceive training on how to do this, or practice completing collaborative writing before the start of the study. The instructor (who was aso the reearcher inthis study) did not interact with students or intervene in the completion of collaborative writing in any way, and was seated a short distance away from the students. From this position, the researcher noted that students generall had a collaborative patten of interaction. However, this was an ad hoc observation based upon the general impression of th instructor/reearcher and thus t i also possible that other types of dyadic interaction, such as dominant/dominant and dominant/passve dyadic interaction, also sometimes occurred (Storch, 2002). As an English medium university, pers primarily deliberated about writing in English although they would occasionally use their first language. Arabic use was primarily asociated with the useof iscourse markers uch as wl, or you know while conversing.

# 3.2. Instruments & data collection

In this quantitative study, pre and post-test writing data was collected. Data about the pre and post-test writing of both groups could be analysed to assess changes that occurred in the individual writing of the students who completed either collborative or inde. pendent writing (as illustrated in Fig. 1).

To ensure that the pre and post-test writing tasks were similar and that diffrences between them did not significantly affect the results, two writing tasks that had previously been used as writing diagnostics (writing task A and writing task ) were selected. These are shown below:

# Writing task A.

Some people say that childhood obesity is increasing in many countries around the world. What are the possble causes of this increase and what can be done to deal with this problem?.

# Writing task B.

Some people say that young people do not do as much exercise as they did in the past. What are the possible causes of this and wha! can be done to deal with this issue?

These writing activities had the same level of dificulty. They were selected because both involved the same type of expository writing as different genres have been shown to affect language use (Mazgutova & Kormos, 2015). Also, both writing tasks were about similar topics which allowed a comparison between the two pieces of writing. The importance of this choice is that the topic that learners write about can affect the language that they use. For example, Yoon (2017) found that when students completed expository writing about very different topics, this led to significant ifferences in the linguistic complexity of the writing that they produced. Finally, to counterbalance both writing activities, writing task A was firt used for the pre-writing task and then task B for post-test writing in the firt round of data collection and this was inverted for the second-round, thus task B was used for pre-task writing and task A for post-test writing.

After allscripts had been collected, the students personal details (e.g., name and ID #) were removed and the samples were assigned an identifying code which corresponded to the student, clas group and that indicated whether this was an example of pre or post-test writing. For assessment, these scripts $( \mathbf { n } = 2 5 6 )$ were jumbled up by randomly assigning each a number from 1 to 256, removing the identifying code (after the number that corresponded to each particular script had been recorded) and then reordering the scripts by number (1 to 256). By doing this, the asessors were not able to know whether the script had been completed by a student from the collaborative or independent writing group or whether this had been completed as a pre or post-test writing activity.

# 3.3. Data analysis

The measures used in the study involved either manual, computerized or acombination of manual and computerized assessment For measures involving manual assessment, all writing samples were assessed by a first examiner $( \mathbf { n } = 2 5 6 )$ and $2 5 \%$ of all scripts $( \mathtt { n } = 6 4 )$ were randomly selected to be assessed by a second rater. Both examiners had extensive experience in second language writing assesment and had worked together for more than 5 years; completing numerous norming sesions together over this period of time. Even though both examiners had worked together extensively on the assessment of second language writing, training was completed to ensure that both were rating in the same way. This was confirmed by the assessment of inter-rater reliability for each of the measures involving manual assesment. This involved the identification of grammatical, lexical, and spelling errors and the identification of three dfferent sentence types (simple, compound and comple sentences) to establish the ratio of complex sentences per text. For other measures, student text was transcribed and analyzed using text analysis applications.

This study assessed how carrying out either collborative or independent writing affcted the linguistic features of written discourse. It measured the CAF of the individual writing that students completed before (pre-test) and after (post-test) either collaborative or independent writing had been carried out, and the degree of change between these two measures which Bulte and Housen (2014) suggest are indicative of language development and learning. From the numerous posible measures of complexity, accuracy and fluency outlined by Wolfe-Quintero, Inagaki and Kim (1998), progress-sensitive measures were selected that would be able to pick up shifts or changes that could possbly occur over a short period of time (Bulte & Housen, 2014). To measure complexity, both syntactic and lexical complexity were assessed. Poli (2011) teses that complexity is comprised of both syntactic and lexical complexit, and both of these facets were measured in this study. Syntactic complexity assessed sentential, phraal, and clausal syntactic complexity (Ortega, 2015). For lexical complexity, measures were used which focused on different aspects of lexical elaoration. These are lexical diversity, which asesses the range and variety of words used (Malvern, Richards, Chipere & Duran, 2004) and lexical sophistication, which assesses the percentage of lexis from the more advanced word groups, such as those from GSL $2 5 0 0 +$ word groups. To assess accuracy, the measures used consider both global errors and errors by type. Polio (1997) stresses that with homogeneous populations, a more fine-grained measure of accuracy, such as an err-count may be needed. This scholar also suggests that it is possble tocount and classif erors by type (Polio, 2003). In reference to these recommendations, the present study identified the grammatical, lexical and spelling errors in each text to calculate the number of errors per 100 words/per text. Gram matical erors included incorrect verb conjugation and verb tense, grement errors, incorrect/missing articles, incorrct/missing prepositions, incorrect word order and incorrect nouns, pronouns, demonstratives, adjectives, adverbs and comparatives and superlatives. Lexical errors included semantic, word formation and collocational erors as wellas unrecognizable words. Spelling errors identified words that were spelt incorrectly. In this study, three measures of fluency were selected that Wolfe-Quintero et al. (1998) stress have been shown to distinguish between different levels of proficiency. One of these measures, words per error-free T-unit, includes elements of accuracy and complexity, but it also highlights the writers ability to writ longer, more elaborated sentences that are error-free within a given period of time. Table 3 outlines the measures used in this study, grouped according to complexity, accuracy and fluency, and details how learning is operationalized.

To verify the consistency of manual asessment, the rate of inter-rater and inra-rater reliability were assessed. y comparing the umber of scrips that hd be ssed in the same way by th first ad sond aessor, the rate f inter-rater reliabilit expresed as simple percentage agreement) could be established. From the sample of scripts that were assessed by both $\mathbf { \Pi } ( \mathbf { n } = 6 4 \mathbf { \check { \rho } } _ { c }$ , the examiners identified the same grammatical, lexical, and spelling errors in 52 of the 64 writig samples, and the different sentence types in the same number of scripts; resulting in $8 1 . 3 \%$ inter-rater reliability for these measures. To resolve differences in rating, the scripts that had been asessed diffrently were reviewed by both examiners until a final rating was agreed upon by both; thus there was $1 0 0 \%$ agreement between both assessors on the final rating of these scripts (see Johnson, Penny, Gordon, Shumate & Fisher 2005). To establish the consistency of the first examiner, who assessed all of the writing scripts $( \mathtt { n } = 2 5 6 )$ $1 0 ~ \%$ of the scripts $\left( \mathbf { n } = 2 6 \right)$ were randomly selected to be reassessed. By comparing the original rating to the rating of the randomly selected scripts the rate of intra-rater reliability (expressed as simple percentage agreement) could be determined. The frst examiner identified the different sentence types in all of the 26 writing samples in the same way as had ben originally asessed. This examiner also identified grammatical, lexical, and spelling errors in 25 of the 26 scripts in the same way. As a result there was $1 0 0 ~ \%$ intra-rater reliability for the identification of different sentences and $9 6 . 2 ~ \%$ for the identification of grammatical, lexical, and spelling errors. The evaluation of inter-rater and intra-rater reliability thus underlines the consistency of manual assessment in the present study.

To report the results of this study, descriptive statistics relating to the complexity, accuracy and fluency of the pre and post-test writing of students from the collaborative and independent writing groups are presented, then the results of the tests of statistical significance relating to each of these. These willbe presented according to the degree of change noted between pre and post-test measures which may differ from the order in which they usually are presented. To test statistical ignificance, a mixed model $2 \times 2$ multivariate analysi of variance (MANovA) was used. This tes assesse cluster of conceptuall related dependent variables, such as those related to accuracy for example. Scholars such as Pallnt (2003) suggest that this test controls for the risk f Type 1 eror. With each ype f analysis, the interaction effc time \* trement on dedent variable is rorted along with the efect siz of ch. Te main effect of time will also be reported, but only interpreted when no significant interaction efect is observed (Field, 2018). The Pilli's rac mutiviate s f snficnc is us ncat wther tee are sttisticll gict ffee mong the groups on a linear combination of the dependent variables (Pallant, 2003) If asignificant difference is found for the combined dependent variables, the individual univariate measures will be reported as well. Before carrying out MANOVA analysis, the researcher verified that the assumptions f the test had ben met and checked for normality, linearit, univariat and multivariate outliers, homogeneity of variance - covariance matrice, and multicollinearit and singularit as recommended by Pallant (2003). No serious violations of these assumptions were noted for any measure assessed.

# 4. Results

A comparison of the changes in CAF in individual writing, completed before and after either collaborative or independent writing had been carried out, revealed that complexity and fluency in individual writing changed i asimilar way ater students had completed either collaborative or independent writing. On the other hand, there were more pronounced increases in the accuracy of individual writing produced by students who completed collaborative writing. These results suggest that the impact of both types of writing on the development of language use in individual writing may differ, and that completing collaborative writing may allow students to learn about correct language use in writing.

As can be seen in Tables 4 and 5 overleaf, completing collaborative writing seems to have had a notable impact on the accuracy of individual writing. Accuracy increased by a significantly greater degree in the post-test writing of learners from the collaborative writing group than in the same writing of students who completed independent writing.

In Table 4, we can see that the ratio oferror-free T-units increased in the post-test writing of the collaborative writing group but decreased in the writing of students who completed independent writing. The mean number of grammatical erors (per 100 words) also decreased in collaborative group post-test writing, but increased in the independent group. Additionall, there were more pronounced decreases in lexicl, and spelling errors (per 100 words) in the post-test writing of the collaborative group. As a result of these differences, there was a significant interaction effect between time and treatment on the combined dependent variables relating tothe accuracy of writing produced (shown in Table 5). This i also reflected by a significant interaction effect for individual univariate measures.

There were very similar changes in measures of fluency and complexity between the pre and post-test writing of learners from the collaborative and independent writig groups. To illustrate, there were similar, notable increases in fluency in the post-test writing of both groups as can be seen in Tables 6 and 7.

As can be seen in Table 6, there was a notable increase in the mean number of words per text in the post-test writing of both groups in addition to an increase in the mean number of words per T-unit and words per error-free T-unit. As a result, there was asignificant increase i fluency in the writing of both groups over time, namely between the pre and post-test writing of both groups. The changes were similar in both and thus the difference between them was not significant. This can be seen in Table 7.

Analysis reveledthat there wasstatisticll sigficant main effect of time on the combined measure offluency a can be seen in Table 7). This means that there was a combined increase in measures f fluency over time in the writing of both groups, also reflected by associated individual univariate measures. The interaction effct between time and treatment on the combined dependent variables relating to the fluency of writing produced was not significant, indicating that the increases in fluency in both groups over time were similar and that there was not greater increase in fluency in either group. As can be seen in Table 7, the main effec of treatment on the combined measures of fluency was sgnificant. However, univariate measures reveal that there was only a significant main effect of treatment on the number of words per script, and not on other measures. The number of words per text in pre and post-test writing were actually dfferent in both groups (shown in Table 6) however the increases in the number of words between these writing samples were similar.

The complexity of individual writing also changed in a similar way after completing collaborative and independent writing. There were similar significant increases in measure of lexical complexity in the post test writing of both groups as ilustrated in Tables 8 and 9, but no notable changes in syntactic complexity or differences between both groups as shown in Tables 10 and 11. As can be seen in Table 8, the mean lexical diversity score increased in the post-test writing of both groups as did the ratio of GSL $2 5 0 0 +$ words (representative of lexical sophistication) although there were slight differences between the increases of both groups.

There was a statisticallysignificant main efect of time on the combined measures of lexical complexity which included lexical diversity and lexical sophistication (indicated by the ratio of GSL $2 5 0 0 +$ words per text) as illustrated in Table 9. These results indicate that lexical complexity incrased overtime in the individual writing of students from both groups. The interaction effect between time and treatment on the combined dependent variables relating to lexical complexity was not significant, and thus the increase in lexical complexity was similar for both writing groups anddid not increase by a significantly greater deree ver time in either one. Univariate measures reveal that there was a significant main effect of time on lexical diversity, but not on lexical sophistication.

There were minimal changes in syntactic complexity between the pre and post-test writing of both groups and as a result no significant differences between the changes of either. Completing either type of writing over this perio of time does not seem to have had an effect on syntactic complexity.

The mean sentence length increased in the post-test writing of the collaborative writing group but decreased slightly in the same writing of the independent writing group. The mean ratio of complex sentences increased in the post-test writing of both groups, but there was almost no change in the mean length of noun phrase between the pre and post-test writing of both as can be seen in Table 10. Results revealed that there was not significant interaction effect between time and treatment on the combined dependent variables relating tosyntactic complexity. The main ffect of time on syntactic complexity also was not significant. This indicates that syntactic complexity did not change significantly over time in the writing of either group.

# 4.1. Summary of results

The results of this study indicate that completing collaborative writing had a notableffect on the accuracy of the individual writing that students subsequently produced. Accuracy increased by a significantly greater degre in the individual writing of students who completed collaborative writing than in the writing of learners who wrote independently. On the other hand, there were similar changes in other measures, such as in the fluency and complexity of the writing of both groups, which indicates that neither type of writing had a greater impact on these facets of written discourse.

# 5. Discussion

The present study compared the efects of completing collaborative or independent writing on the development of language use in individual writing Itassessed how the complexity, accuracy and fluency of individual writing changed asaresult of completing either collaborative or independent writing over a period of 8-weeks. The results revealed that while there were similar changes in complexity and fluency in the post-test writing of both groups, accuracy increased by a significantly greater degree in the individual writing of learners who completed collaborative writig. Clearl, the notable change in ccuracy in individual writing canot solely be attrbuted to the collaborative writing carried out The instruction provided and feedback given on written work may also have had an effect on the writing students produced. However,the more pronounced increases in accuracy in the individual writing f tudents who completed collaborative writig, under the same conditions and over the same period of time as their peers who wrote independently, suggests that L2 students can learn about correct language usefrom writing cllaboratively with their peers and that this can have an impact on their language use in subsequent individual writing; specificall on the accuracy of the writing produced. The results of this study also reflect the findings of previous research which highlight the important effect that collaboration appears to have on the accuracy of L2 writing.

The results of the present study and of previous research seem to sugest that completing collborative writig can have an effect on the accuracy of writing produced; both on writing that is produced collaboratively and on the subsequent individual writing of students who were involved in this writing procedure. Studies carried out by Storch, (2005), Storch & Wigglesworth (2007), Wigglesworth & Storch (2009), Dobao (2012), McDonough et al. (2018) and Vilarreal & Gil-Sarrate (2019) al found that writing produced collaboratively was more acurat than writing produced independently. As learners focus on how language should be used to express their ideas in the coauthored text i is possble that this allows students to learn about correct lnguage use which potentilly may lead to improvement in the individual writing that they subsequently produce. The results of the present study clearly revealed more pronounced improvement in the accuracy of the individual writing of earners who completed collaborative writing. This also has been noted for diffrent modes of interaction. For example, Hsu and Lo (2018) found that accuracy increased by a significantly greater degree in the individual post-test writing of L2 leaners who completed computer-mediated collaborative writing. As result, there is a growing body of research that highlights the positive effect that collaboration can have on accuracy in writing.

Collaborative writing seems to provide L2 students with opportunities to learn about correct language use that are not provided by independent writig. It not only can be viewed as an activity that allows leaners to pool their inguistc resources to correctly express their ideasin text (Swain, 200), but also can be sen as an activity that llows stdents to ln from each ther as they write. Scholar such as Storch and Wigglesworth (2007), Wiglesworth and Storch (2009) and Dobao (2012) have noted that while writing collaboratively, L2 students engage in LREs that can provide them with opportunitie to lean about correct language use. Additionally, the way students deliberate about language use while writing collboratively and the way writing is produced may provide them with additional opportunities to learn about how language should be used. When learners write collaboratively, language use in writing is brought out into the open to be reviewed, questioned, critiqued, explained, or discussed (Storch, 2019). This open deliberation provides L2 students with opportunitie to learn about correct language use that are not provided by independent writing. When students writ collaboratively, Storch (2013) streses that proposals for the co-authored text are continuously reviewed and discussed by both learners. She also notes that 2 students normall review and then agree upon how language should be used to express each idea before moving on to generate and review the next (Storch, 2005). This process increases the likelihood of language errors being detected in proposals for the co-authored text, but also can draw each learner's attntion to their own errors in language use. For example, f a student is unaware that language has been used incorrectly when making a proposal for the coauthored text, a peer can provide corrective fedback and highlight this error in language use; prompting the learner to reconsider the language used. The immediacy of peer fedback also means that students have the opportunity toask peers questions to clarify doubts about language use as writing i being completed. Additionally er feback in collaborative writing multilies the edback that tudents can receive on language use because learners can receive continuous, real-time feedback from peers while writing (Weigle, 2002; Storch, 2005) and can receive written corrective feedback on errors in language use from instructors after writing has been completed.

The results of this study revealed that there were no significant differences between the changes in complexity and fluency in the individual writing of students from the collaborative and independent writing groups. This mirrors the results of studies completed by Storch & Wigglesworth (2007), Wigglesworth & Storch (2009), Doba0,(2012) and Villarreal & Gil-arratea (2019) which asessethe difference btween writing produced collaboratiely and writing roduced indeendently and found that there was ittledifference in the complexity and fluency of the writing produced. Only the studies completed by Storch (2005) and McDonough et al. (2018) found differences in the complexity of the writing completed, but no differences in relation to fluency. The study conducted by Hsu and Lo (2018), that aessed computer-mediated collaborative writing, also found that there were no significant ifferences in the complexty of individual writing produced afer computer-mediated collaborative writing or independent writing had been carried out. Taken together, the results of these studies suggest that ollaboration may have a notable impact on the accuracy of the writing produced, but not on complexity and fluency.

The similar significant increases in fluency and lexical complexity in the post-test writing of students from the collaborative and independent writing groups suggests that carrying out collaborative and independent writig led to similar improvement in these two aspects of writing. However, it could be argued that the improvement in the individual writing of students from these groups was simply the result of another factor common to both writing groups, such as instruction. Thus, without further investigation, we can only conclude that fluency and lexical complexity in individual writing changed in a similar way afer completing both types of writing. Similarly, we can conclude that syntactic complexity did not change significantly in individual writing after collaborative or independent writing had been carried out, and that further investigation is needed to determine why this did not change.

While the present study controlled for intervening variables that potentially could have an impact on the individual writing that students produce, such as instruction and writte feedback on writig,i i recognized that there are other potential intervening ariables that were not controlle for in this study, such as the amount of ime students spent engaged in fre time activities that could also lead to improved language use. Additionally, the L2 learners ability to discuss and deliberate about correct language use while writing collaboratively may be contingent upon their level of English proficiency. Therefore, we cannot be sure that the same changes in accuracy in the writing of the upper-intermediat students who took part in this study would be this same as those inthe writing of students with a lower lel of English proficiency, given that these leaners may not have sufficient knowledge to be able to deliberate about lanuag usefftively. hus furthr inestgation is nd to explore the efft that collaboration can ha on the writing of lower-level L2 students.

# 6. Conclusion

This study revealed that there were diffrences in the development of language use in individual writing afer students had completed collaborative or independent writing under the same conditions and over the same period of time. Accuracy in individual writing increased by a significantly greater degreeafter students had completed collaborative writing than after independent writing had been caried out. This result suggests that students may be abl to learn about correct language use while writing collaboratively with their peers. On the other hand, there were similar changes inthe fluency and complexity of individual writing. Thus, collaborative writing may have a notable ffect on the accuracy of writing, but not on the complexity or fluency of the writing produced. The current study contributes to knowledge about collaborative writing in L2 by ading tothe growing body of research that highlights the positive effect that ollaboration can have on the accuracy of writing, both on the accuracy of writing that i completed collaboratively and on the accuracy of the individual writing that leaners produce ater writing collaboratively with their peers. t also highlights the need for further investigation to determine how frequently students ask questions, share knowledge about language, or are involved in other types of interaction that can allow them to learn about correct language use while writing collaboratively with their peers.

From a pedagogical perspective, collaborative writing seems to be an activity that can allow students to learn about correct language use as writing i being completed. Potentiall, it can be used as a writing-to-learn activity; particularly when educators want students to focus on language use From the reearcher's perspective, collaborative writing is not meant to replace independent writing in L2, nor does its implementation require notable changes to how L2 writing instruction is carried out. Collaborative writing simply provides instructors with a student-centred learning activity that can be alternated with independent writing as needed.
