Two case studies explore disciplinary identity construction by examining two Chinese undergraduates’ personal statement writing. Drawing upon Thompson’s model (2012), an analytical framework of three voice levels was proposed to analyze the students’ disciplinary identity construction. It is found that the writers voiced their disciplinary identity propositionally, structurally and holistically. Interview data reveal that the writers voiced the intended disciplinary identity of being disciplinarily capable and personally unique to gain membership into the target disciplinary communities. The pedagogical implications for voice construction in academic writing teaching and learning are addressed.

# 1. Introduction

Writing like or as a disciplinary community member has long been an important subject of research. Some scholars have examined the genres that students must produce on their way into a disciplinary community, such as master’s theses and the doctoral dissertations (e.g. Cadman, 1997; Chang & Strauss, 2010; Deng, 2012; Lim et al., 2015). Some have studied the genres that acknowledged members of a disciplinary community produce, such as research articles and textbooks (e.g. Bhatia, 2008; Bondi, 2012; Lin et al., 2014; Wu, 2013). Some have discussed the genres that contribute to the professional development of novice researchers, such as grant proposals and blind manuscript reviews (e.g. Connor & Mauranen, 1999; Fazel & Shi, 2015; Matsuda & Tardy, 2007; Tse & Hyland, 2008). Different as the focus may be, academic writing involves the construction of identity by writers that is recognized and acknowledged by academic communities. A useful analytical framework for examining writer identity construction is provided by Ivanic (1998) who has proposed four aspects of writer identity (i.e. a writer’s autobiographical self, discoursal self, authorial self and socially available possibilities for self-hood). Based on Ivanic’s framework, studies have been conducted to examine writer identity in different contexts (e.g. Kim et al., 2006; Li & Deng, 2019; Quellette, 2008; Sheldon, 2009; Starfield & Ravelli, 2006; Tang & John, 1999).

Negotiated and constructed through discourse, identity can be “captured by concepts such as ethos and voice” (Matsuda, 2015, p. 141), and voice plays a key role in the exploration of identity because voice can offer a means to give expression to identity (e.g. Hirvela & Belcher, 2001; Hyland, 2008; Hyland & Guinda, 2012; Ivanic, 1998; Ivanic & Camps, 2001; Matsuda, 2001, 2015; Matsuda & Tardy, 2007; Tardy, 2012a, 2012b; Zhao, 2019).

Several studies have researched how writers modulate voice to construct or develop an identity in a new disciplinary community. Ivanic and Camps (2001) examined the writing of six graduate students from Mexico after they entered new discourse communities in British universities. Based on Halliday’s (1985) theory of the macro-functions of language (i.e. ideational, interpersonal and textual positioning), they argued that all writing contains voices which are characterized by three concurrent rhetorical modes of writer positioning, and that writers draw on the repertoire of voices they have encountered in their experience of participating in genres and discourses. Dressen-Hammouda (2008) analyzed how one geology student’s developing disciplinary identity allowed him to move from a novice writer to writing like a disciplinary expert. It was postulated that in the process of disciplinary becoming, the student gained a disciplinary voice and came to master the genres of the new disciplinary community. Maclean (2010) studied how a group of first-year law students made the transition from a student identity to a professional legal identity through combining the different voices in a jointly written letter of advice to a simulated client. These studies tended to focus on either the writers who tried to develop disciplinary identity as members of the relevant disciplinary communities or the writers who tried to construct new disciplinary identities in simulated contexts. Although the previous studies conclude that voice is involved in all writing and it is an integral aspect of identity construction, very few studies have examined how writers voice a new identity in order to enter an authentic disciplinary community. The current study aims to explore how two Chinese undergraduate students voiced their potential disciplinary identity in order to enter new disciplinary communities through examining their personal statements written to apply for two Master’s degree programs.

# 2. Disciplinary identity and voice levels in the personal statement

Loosely defined, a community is a group of people whose members share common values and work for common goals or purposes (van de Poel & Gasiorek, 2012, p. 295). Bruce (2016) identifies three theoretical approaches, each of which serves a different research purpose, that have been employed to examine an academic community. The speech community approach has been adopted to examine the use of language that involves regular face-to-face interactions among members of an academic community. The discourse community approach has been used extensively in the field of English for specific purposes (ESP) to examine academic written genres. The community of practice approach aims to examine situated learning with focus on engagement and participation within a community.

Within an academic community, there are more closely-knitted disciplinary communities. Disciplines can be seen as cultures (Hyland, 2004, p. 11), in which collective practices are created through identification of similarities and differences (Hyland, 2012, p. 57). Disciplinary cultures provide information about goals and objectives, about norms and conventions, and about the nature of identity one is allowed to construct (Bhatia, 2008, p. 124). Disciplines can also be seen as “institutionalized and legitimized entities of knowledge” evidenced by such “physical presence” as “the department” and “the program of the study” (Chandrasomn, 2010, p. 4). Written to apply for a targeted program of study in higher education institutions, a personal statement is discipline-oriented. In this sense, discipline-oriented departments or programs of study constitute disciplinary communities that personal statement writers aim to gain membership. Such disciplinary communities have their own disciplinary norms, practices and expectations of their members. Samraj and Monk’s study of variations in three disciplines (2008) indicates that personal statements are constrained by the disciplinary norms and expectations of academic communities to which the writers are applying for a membership. Li and Deng’s case study of one student’s applying for four different programs over a three-year period (2019) reveals that a desired writer identity (i.e. a qualified and special applicant who could fit into the target program) was constructed to help the writer get admitted to the target programs and thus gain membership of the target programs.

In personal statement writing, attempts to gain membership involve constructing a potential disciplinary identity recognized and acknowledged by a disciplinary community. This disciplinary identity is “potential” in that personal statement writers may still be out-group members of their targeted disciplinary communities, unacquainted with disciplinary norms, expectations and practices. As Dressen-Hammouda puts it, “one’s disciplinary identity is an ensemble of socio-historical regularities and norms that practitioners embody as a result of specializing within their disciplines” (2008, p.235). Only after personal statement writers get admitted to their target programs can they be said to have projected “an emerging scholarly identity” (Fazel & Shi, 2015, p. 208) or “a disciplinarily appropriate identity” (Tse & Hyland, 2008, p. 1232). The potential disciplinary identity is both social and personal because personal statement writers have to demonstrate that they meet the requirements and expectations of their target programs and that they are unique in their motivations, life experiences and future plans. (Potential) disciplinary identity can be understood as how we define ourselves, how others define us and how we represent ourselves to others in a disciplinary community. Such a disciplinary identity reveals one is both distinctive from, and similar to, the other members of the disciplinary community (Hyland, 2012, p. 71).

Like identity, voice can also be both individual and social (Matsuda & Tardy, 2007; Prior, 2001; Tardy, 2012a, 2012b). The individualized aspect of voice, prominently demonstrated by the use of first person pronouns or self-mention, is considered as a signal for a strong authorial voice and identity construction (Flottum, 2012; Hyland, 2001, 2012; Ivanic & Camps, 2001; Zereva, 2013). Self-mention has become a feature that many studies used in their analysis (Hyland, 2001, 2002a, 2002b; Helms-Park & Stapleton, 2003; Kuo, 1999; Sheldon, 2009; Starfield & Ravelli, 2006; Tang & John, 1999). However, as Stock and Eik-Nes (2016) point out, “the overemphasis on linguistic features, such as the use of first person pronouns, entails the risk that research on voice ignores content-related features that might be more relevant in the construction of voice” (p.89). Taking into account the social aspect of voice, scholars have also attached importance to the dialogism of voice or the “coconstructing of voice” that features “both the writer’s creating and the reader’s perception of the author’s voice” (Stock & EikNes, 2016, p.96). For example, Matsuda and Tardy have highlighted the importance of the reader in the author’s voice construction (Matsuda & Tardy, 2007; Tardy & Matsuda, 2009).

Genre also has a significant impact on writers’ voice construction. The personal statement belongs to an occluded genre (Chiu, 2016; Ding, 2007; Li & Deng, 2019; Samraj & Monk, 2008; Swales, 1990), which means there is little (if any) interaction between writers and readers. Unlike the writers of some other academic written genres such as thesis, essays, and research articles who tend to get feedbacks or comments on the writing from their readers (e.g. Cadman, 1997; Harwood & Petric, 2012; Matsuda & Tardy, 2007), personal statement writers receive either an admission letter or a rejection note rather than an assessment about their writing. Furthermore, they usually have no personal contact with their readers so that they know nothing about their readers’ personal preferences. The target readers of a personal statement tend to be seasoned scholars who serve as the gatekeepers of a specific discipline. Therefore, what personal statement writers try to cater to are the admission requirements, the hypothetical expectations of their targeted disciplines rather than the readers’ personal preferences. To achieve this purpose, the writers are assumed to create disciplined-related self-images to leave a favorable impression on the gatekeepers. The effort to influence in any way any of the participants in an activity was termed as “performance” by Goffman (1959, p. 26), whose purpose is to achieve “impression management” (p.203). The overall impression that a reader forms of a writer is tied to “a cumulative effect of the many features” instead of just one feature (Tardy, 2012, p.67). This cumulative effect aligns with “the amalgamative effect of the use of discursive and non-discursive features that language users chose, deliberately or otherwise, from socially available yet ever-changing repertories”, which is defined as voice by Matsuda (2001, p.40).

The overall presence of the author’s voice should go beyond the linguistic features to capture “content-related features” and “to avoid the risk that research on voice is limited to form features and discussions about the use of first person pronouns” (Stock & Eik-Nes, 2016, p.98). Thompson (2012) proposed a three-level model of stance and voice to examine PhD theses. The model was used to analyze the semantic content of sentences (at the propositional level), textual coherence in terms of metadiscourse (at intermediate levels), and the cumulative impression of a writer that has been constructed through the text (at the holistic level).

Drawing upon Thompson’s model, we also propose a three-level model to analyze voice construction in personal statements (see Fig. 1). Parallel to each other, the propositional content level and the structural level constitute the foundation level. According to Keizer (2015), the propositional content can go beyond the semantic content of sentences to encompass one or more episodes, “a representative layer representing a coherent sequence of events characterized by unity of participants, time and location”(p.311). In our case studies of the personal statements, we would focus on the propositional content in terms of both the semantic content of sentences and “episodes” or a series of life experiences of the personal statement writers. At the structural level, we would examine textual organization in terms of metadiscourse, “an umbrella term for a range of linguistic features” to make a text coherent in a way preferred by the writer (Thompson, 2012, p. 125). At the higher level, namely, the holistic level, we would examine the self-images the writers tried to create or the overall impression they tried to leave on the readers. The three voice levels in our model aim to address three questions related to voice construction in the personal statements, “What is voiced in the personal statements?“, “How is it voiced?“, and “Why do the writers choose to voice in such a way?” Like Hirvela and Belcher who used Cummins’s term “voicing”, we also use the verb form of voice to “capture its nature as an activity, as a process, not as a fixed or final product to be measured in a piece of writing (Hirvela & Belcher, 2001, p. 90). We assume that the three voice levels are complementary to each other to serve the overarching purpose of voicing the potential disciplinary identity that can be recognized and acknowledged by gatekeepers.

While Thompson proposes his model to examine PhD theses whose writers must “project a voice of individual expert authority” and also “position themselves … ultimately within a disciplinary community” (2012, p.119), our model targets at personal statements whose writers must project a voice of individual uniqueness and also position themselves into a disciplinary community. Thompson’s model illustrates “the gradations of voice” (p.120), which may imply a hierarchy of different voice levels, but our model proposes the complement of voice levels. We suggest that voice levels relate to each other in different ways and in different genres. Due to genre differences, the two models have different focuses of analysis at different voice levels. At the propositional level, Thompson uses the concepts of averral and attribution to differentiate sources of propositional statements particularly in terms of citations. Our model, however, refers to the concept of “episodes” to examine propositional contents in terms of life experiences. Although both models examine textual coherence, our model focuses on what makes life experiences coherent at the structural level while Thompson’s aims to “guide their readers around” (p.125) at the intermediate levels. At the holistic level, our model centers on the overall impression writers try to leave on readers; Thompson does not elaborate on this level. Our model is a development of Thompson’s.

# 3. Methodology

To address the research questions, we focus on two cases, that is, two Chinese undergraduate students who applied for Master’s degree programs and gained admission. Gerring defines case study as an intensive study of a single unit for the purpose of understanding a larger class of similar units (2015, p.119). Yin (2014) claims that case study is the preferred research method to address “how” and “why” questions. To examine disciplinary identity construction at different voice levels, the case studies employ both textual analysis of the personal statements and follow-up interviews.

# 3.1. Case description

Participants of the case studies were solicited by posting a message through WeChat and QQ, two popular on-line social communication interfaces in China. Based on the voluntary principle, several students consented to be interviewed after they got the offers from the targeted universities and decided on the programs they were going to pursue. Two of the participants (with the pseudonyms of Yao and Shirley) were particularly chosen for the present study because both changed their fields of study when applying for the Master’s degree programs, which is more likely to demonstrate the construction of disciplinary identity. The background information of the participants is given in Table 1. The two students volunteered to participate in our research, and we guaranteed them that their personal statements and interview scripts would be used only for research purposes and that the finished research article would not be submitted for publishing without their consent.

# 3.2. Textual analysis

Previous research on personal statement writing mainly examined the rhetorical structure by means of move analysis (see Appendix 1). The findings show that four or five moves are involved in personal statements. Most categorizations of moves are a combination of the structure (e.g. hook, opening move, introduction, conclusion) and the propositional contents (e.g. background, reasons for applying, career goals etc.). A couple of the studies categorized a move or a step termed as “selfpromotion”, which we think should be the main purpose of personal statement writing because the personal statement is a (self-)promotional genre whose main purpose is to promote oneself to gain admission (Chiu, 2016; Ding, 2007; Li & Deng, 2019). We propose that it is necessary to examine the propositional contents, the structure and the purpose separately.

We based the textual analysis on our proposed three-level voice construction model. At the propositional content level, we focused on the three moves that all the previous genre analysis of personal statements had mentioned: motivations (reasons for applying), life experiences (including background, schooling, interests and activities) and aspirations (future goals). What is voiced is as important as how it is voiced. At the structuring level, we put emphasis on what made a text coherent, which may reveal the integration of different aspects of the propositional content. At the holistic level, we examined the self-images the writers tried to create by cross-referencing what they presented in the personal statements and what they explained in the interviews.

# 3.3. Interviews

Interviews were used to complement the findings of textual analysis to get a better understanding of the writers’ choices concerning different voice levels involved in the personal statements. Patton has suggested that we interview to find out what is on other people’s mind to get access to their stories, and that the purpose of interviewing is to allow us to enter into other people’s perspectives (2015, p. 426). In other words, the major advantage of using interviews as a data collection tool lies in its strength as a strategy to find out from interviewees the things that we cannot directly observe, such as feelings, attitudes, preferences, motives and intentions. Therefore, discourse-based semi-structured interviews were utilized to stimulate the participants’ recalling of their personal statement writing and to elicit the information needed for addressing the research questions. Based on the findings of a pilot study and a careful textual analysis of the personal statements, 20 interview questions were designed (see Appendices 2 and 3). The interview questions fall into four categories: background information, writing processes, the contents of the written texts, and the global reflection on personal statement writing. It is hoped that the interviewees would reveal their perceptions of identity construction when they reflected upon their writing process and their written texts.

The interviewees were asked the same general questions in order to maximize comparability of their responses (see Patton, 2015, p. 438). However, we also asked more tailored follow-up questions to give the participants a chance to elaborate on the content of their statements. Such a semi-structured interview was employed for two reasons. Semi-structured interviews would allow for much more leeway for elaborating on whatever interviewees deem important; on the other hand, interviewers have a greater say in orienting the conversation to the issues that they deem important in relation to the research questions (Brinkmann, 2014, p. 286).

Before the participants were interviewed, the questions were emailed to them so that they could be mentally prepared. They preferred to use Chinese in the interviews. All the interview data were transcribed and translated to English for further analysis and interpretation. The focus of interview transcript study was placed on the content rather than on the specific use of language; therefore, filler words, redundant words, slips of the tongue and irrelevant information were deleted in the transcription. In other words, only the information relevant to the designed questions would be transcribed. As a list of interview questions had been designed beforehand, the analysis of interview transcripts could be done in a relatively efficient way.

# 4. Findings

# 4.1. At the propositional content level

As has been mentioned, previous genre analyses of personal statements have shown that successful writers tend to state their motivations for applying, their qualifications and their aspirations effectively. Yao and Shirley were no exceptions. Both Yao and Shirley changed their disciplines when applying. It was their interests and career goals that motivated them to pursue a different field of study, which can be seen at the very beginning of their personal statements. For example:

When I was in high school, I was a member of robot interest group, in which I became quite interested in Computer Science and Informatics. Thus, during undergraduate period, I’m quite interested in the research of Computer Vision …

It is my aspiration to pursue a career in management, which is a strong interest and goal that I have set for myself since college.

Their motivations and aspirations were inextricably connected. Immediately after Yao stated that “becoming a software engineer in a technology company would be a quite suitable choice as the beginning of my career path”, he explained his motivations for choosing the target program in the concluding paragraph. “XXX university is definitely a good choice” for him because in Yao’s words, the target program “fits perfectly with my interest and career aspirations” and “will provide me with the state-of-the-art knowledge in CS”. Like Yao, Shirley also followed her aspiration for a “career goal of becoming a professional management practitioner” with her motivations. She believed further study in the target program was “indispensable” for two reasons: her “deficiencies in systematic business theories and practical experience” as well as the “wellexperienced faculty” and “a fantastic learning and practical environment” of the applied university.

While their motivations and aspirations could reveal why they were applying for the target programs and what their career goals were, their relevant life experiences would demonstrate what might make them potential candidates. Both Yao and Shirley devoted most of their texts to the narration of their experiences. Yao narrated three types of experiences (i.e. his participation in a research project, two course projects and a full-time internship), and Shirley also narrated four kinds of experiences (i.e. her undergraduate academic pursuit, her internship, her work experience, and her extra-curricular activities). Although they had totally different experiences in real life or different “episodes” in terms of the propositional content, they tended to share four similarities. First, all their experiences were target-discipline-oriented. Yao’s experiences were computer science-related, and Shirley’s experiences were business management-related. Second, both presented their desired self-images explicitly by using positive words to describe their abilities and qualities. Yao used the following words to exhibit his CS-related abilities and qualities:

interested in Computer Science and Informatics   
solid mathematical and analytical skill   
my strong desire to contribute to practical application   
my curiosity to explore the unknown of computer science   
my teamwork ability   
the ability to solve-problem independently, cooperate with peers and supervisors effectively and to acquire new skills

quickly

Like Yao, Shirley used a series of positive words to describe her abilities and qualities relevant to management. For example:

my aspiration to pursue a career in management a solid foundation for work in the biological industry calculus and linear algebra knowledge and techniques statistical and econometrics skills

adept at summarizing financial and economic statistics into useful information   
our enterprising spirit   
determined to become an accomplished professional in management   
my PR abilities and problem-solving skills   
my commitment to every work   
to remain calm in the face of adverse events   
my strong sense of responsibility

Third, both substantiated their discipline-relevant capabilities (e.g. algorithm design for Yao and coordination for Shirley) by describing in detail what they did, as they wrote in their personal statements as follows:

My main contribution of this project was the design of algorithm. Specifically, I proposed a fast coarse location method based on image color information, and also used the HSV Space detection and corresponding color feature vector to guarantee the speed of detection.

Combining market capability and industry environmental analysis, while also refining market research and targeting customer segments were becoming my routine work.

Fourth, both not only narrated what they did in their experiences, but also showed what they had gained from their experiences; that is, they had improved the discipline-required skills or qualities. For example:

Moreover, through the combined testing, delivery and document written work, not only improved my teamwork ability, but also strengthened my view of integrity and rigor of software development. The ability to solve-problem independently, cooperate with peers and supervisors effectively and to acquire new skills quickly will be applicable to my future master’s program, especially when conducting group projects. Besides, it also broadened my view about the usage of data in such a Big Data Era, which help me understand the importance of intersection with so many CS technologies and Information Technologies.

All these experiences have taught me to remain calm in the face of adverse events for, behind any problem, there is always a great solution. On the other hand, I discovered my strong sense of responsibility.

# 4.2. At the structuring level

Yao regarded the opening paragraph as a “lead-in” that showed his interest in and his academic preparations for computer science. The lead-in ended in a statement: “Below, I will briefly describe some of my past research, projects and practical experiences.” This statement leads to the body paragraphs that illustrate Yao’s academic capabilities through narrating his past experiences.

Yao did not present these experiences randomly; instead, he chose to follow the time order, as he explained as follows:

In the main part of the body, you only had that much to write about, and you had to connect them all, making it coherent. It’s not merely a list of what you did. I planned to use time order to connect all the experiences, which might look more natural.

We can see that Yao’s time order mainly follows a past-present-future sequence. However, the three timescales are not of equal importance, as he remarked in the interview:

I attached more importance to the past and the present, because they are my experiences, and my experiences are my assets. They can reflect my competence to some extent. I thought I should try my best to write my past experiences, and I devoted a very small portion to the future anticipation.

To show his eagerness, Yao expressed his confidence in his future performance and his sincerity of application at the end of   
the personal statement. Yao also paid compliment to the target program in the concluding part, which is reflected by his   
language choices such as “innovative and highly integrated” and “the state-of-the-art knowledge in CS”. He explained why he   
ended the text in such a manner: “Because I think when you tell a story or when you make a request, you will talk much about   
yourself first, and finally you should write about the target.” At the end of his personal statement, therefore, the focus shifts   
from Yao, a disciplinarily capable applicant, to the target program, which appears to be a good choice for his further study. Unlike Yao, Shirley opened the personal statement with her aspirations for the future. She explained her reasons like this:

I think every admission officer must have read many personal statements. So I didn’t want him/her to spend too much time reading how I became interested in this field of study. I wanted to tell them I had a strong sense of purpose. And a person with a strong sense of purpose has strong motivations. I wanted them to know what I would like to do in the future. It’s come-straight-to-the-point writing approach.

Shirley’s academic preparations were revealed through her narrating undergraduate academic pursuits, which is followed by her various business management-related experiences.

Shirley said that when she started writing the personal statement, she “used the very conventional method, beginning with how I became interested in this field of study, followed by my experiences and ended with what I wanted to do”. She chose “the time order”. But when she asked a native English speaker for help, she was recommended to rework this because the way she wrote was “too cliched ”. Therefore, she put her aspirations at the very beginning so as to make her objectives clearer and to show she was highly motivated. Although she began with her aspirations, Shirley thought her plans were not as important as her past experiences. She explained this in the following way:

I attached more importance to my past experiences through which I could present what kind of person I was. I couldn’t write much about my future. If I wrote in detail about my future, it could be in conflict with the objectives of the program. Or in other words, they might think I didn’t know much about this field. If I, at such an early stage, decided on the field and the department in which I was going to work, it might reflect I had a strong sense of purpose, but would it confine my future development in some sense? So what I preferred in my future plans was to set a short-term goal, what was I going to do in a short run. It would be ok if I only got a general orientation towards my long-term goal.

In the concluding paragraph, Shirley shifted the focus from herself (i.e. being an applicant active in communicating with other people, disciplinarily capable and all-rounded) to the target program by writing “I believe further study in your school remains indispensable”. She used the complementary words such as “a fantastic learning and practical environment” and “its well-experienced faculty” to show her motivations for choosing the target program. But she ended the personal statement by claiming that she would contribute to the target program. She gave the following reasons:

First of all, what I wrote about was “why me?” Why would the school select me? What advantages did I have? So at the end, I would write “why school?“, “why the program?” Why did I choose this school? Why did I choose this program? In the previous paragraphs, I wrote a lot about how I matched this program. So at the end I would write what I could do for the school. So I hope them to see what difference I could bring to this program. As far as I know, I will be the only one with a biology background in my class. There are few students with science background. I changed my discipline, and there are really few applicants like me. So I hope that they would think I was different, and I could bring diversity and vitality to the class.

By the end of her statement, Shirley had shifted focus from the target program to herself, specifically to how she could contribute to the program.

# 4.3. At the holistic level

Holistically, both Yao and Shirley tried to leave a favorable impression by projecting positive self-images, both explicitly and implicitly.

Yao remarked in the interview that he wanted to leave an impression like this:

The impression is similar to my writing purposes. I wanted to leave an impression that I changed my field of study, but I was capable of accomplishing your program, and I am eager to study further. In a word, it’s to have them admit me.

In order to leave such an impression, Yao not only explicitly stated his abilities and qualities, but also implicitly suggested his intended image. In the opening of his personal statement, after a show of his interest in computer science, he wrote the following words:

I also kept excellent academic achievements in many subjects related to CS, especially in Data Structures, Database Principal Application, Object-Oriented Programming, Digital Image Processing, and Software Engineering and so on. All of these courses have helped me lay a solid foundation and with an introduction of CS. From the variety of practical projects, I have mastered the professional knowledge and skills from many projects, as well as programming languages such as Java, C and ${ \mathsf { C } } { + } { + }$ . Moreover, my practical ability in programming was enhanced from creating one mobile service in internship.

Yao attempted to leave a general impression of being disciplinarily capable by displaying his CS-related academic achievements, professional knowledge and skills as well as practical ability. Yao devoted most of the text to his past experiences, because what he intended to highlight most in the personal statement was his “shining points” that were reflected in his CS-related experiences. He related in the interview as follows:

When I present myself in my personal statement to a professor, he may detect my shining points from the details. For example, in an algorithm, what progress did I make? And it could reflect my, say, critical thinking ability. Another example is here that I was a leader and I led my team to complete a project, a small software engineering project. And it could reflect my leadership, couldn’t it? And in the internship, I conducted a project assigned to me. I participated in it and discussed with others. Or I might encounter some difficulties. They could show I were a quick learner, my ability to handle something new. What I did when I wrote is that I matched your program. I would highlight the details a little bit.

In the concluding paragraph, he ended the text by expressing his confidence in improving his performance and the sincerity of his application, which may suggest his eagerness for further study. When asked what special attention he paid to while writing, Yao replied in details like this:

First, you need to tell your relevant experiences. Second, you need to show your eagerness for studying in this field of study. Especially I changed my discipline. So your personal statement is intended to state you want to participate in this program, and you are capable, and you have potential. So I think you need to highlight, in terms of content, what you did before, what preparations you have made for this program, and how well you will do in the future.

Shirley created a self-image that was different from Yao’s. When asked what kind of image she intended to create, Shirley replied as follows:

The most important is to show I’m active. In terms of my personality, I’m active in communicating with other people. On the other hand, I am capable of information processing, and of doing research. I just want to let them feel I am wellrounded.

In her personal statement, however, Shirley projected this self-image (as both active and capable) more implicitly than explicitly. For example, she explained the intentions of narrating experiences as follows:

As to my experience of starting up business, I intended to show my teamwork ability and my strong communication ability, and also management and overall planning. Because I was responsible for marketing in the start-up business team, I did much work hunting for partners, mainly human resource issues. As to the extracurricular activities, I mainly wrote about my volunteering experiences because I wanted to leave an impression that I took part in a variety of volunteering activities. The internship experience displayed my good information processing ability, and the other experiences showed my time management and communication skills. In a word, I am an all-rounded applicant.

In Shirley’s view, “meeting the requirements is the bottom-line. If you can’t cross the line, you will fail.” She suggested that she could meet the requirements by displaying her business-related capabilities through narrating various experiences that could reveal her information processing capabilities and well-roundedness. Besides, those biotech-related experiences could also distinguish her from the other applicants, as she expressed in the interview account:

I was different indeed. There were few applicants like me who changed their discipline. Every year they go over the personal statements, they can seldom find someone who come from a totally different field of study. So if I wanted to show my uniqueness, I would focus on this point.

At the very end of her personal statement, she expressed the belief that she could use her experiences in the biotech industry to provide a new perspective for her classmates and to contribute to the diversity of the class, which well suggests that she would be “active in communicating with other people”.

Holistically, although Yao and Shirley created different self-images, both tried to leave a favorable impression of being disciplinary capable and personally unique. Meeting the requirements seemed to be the main reason for both of them to choose relevant experiences. They explained their reasons for choosing the discipline-related experiences in the following interview accounts respectively:

I thought then that you had to prove you were qualified and you met the requirements. So I tried my best to write every important detail in the three experiences. I wrote about what I did, what my original idea was, or what my shining points were.

Because the school I was applying for was business-oriented, I would choose business-related experiences and activities to write about. In fact, I didn’t have much research experience and academic experience. I had no other choice. The main purpose is to match the objectives of the program better. I would find some relevant experiences to match the requirements.

Both Yao and Shirley changed their disciplines when applying. Yao stated clearly in his personal statement he changed his field of study. He explained the reasons as follows:

I stated clearly I changed my major. It might be a deficiency. That’s why I would come to your school for further study. But despite the deficiency, I conducted some projects related to CS. Compared with the other applicants who also changed their majors, I had more advantages. My uniqueness is the shining points in the details (of my experiences).

Unlike Yao, Shirley took advantage of the change of discipline as she remarked like this:

I was at a disadvantage because my undergraduate field of study is not business-related, but I was applying for a business-related program. So I hope I would present it as my uniqueness rather than my disadvantage. That is, compared with the other applicants, I had a science background and had the stronger computing ability than the others. So, what I paid attention to most was how to make it more appealing by taking advantage of my Biology background.

# 5. Discussion

The case studies reported on here aimed to examine how two Chinese undergraduate students, Yao and Shirley, voiced their disciplinary identity at three different voice levels in their personal statement writing so that they would be accepted as members of the target programs.

Propositionally, both Yao and Shirley used discipline-specific terms, narrated discipline-related experiences, and described discipline-oriented motivations and aspirations. To voice the intended disciplinary identity, Yao and Shirley referred to their disciplinary capabilities explicitly by using ability-related words, such as Yao’s “my practical ability in programming” and “teamwork ability”, and Shirley’s “my PR abilities and problem-solving skills”. But more convincingly, both substantiated the “capability words” by narrating their discipline-related personal experiences in detail including what they did specifically and what contributions they made. This seems to align with Ding’s (2007) finding that “successful essays employed stories highly relevant to the rhetorical purpose of the genre” (p.383). Furthermore, in their narration, Yao used some CS-related terms and Shirley used some business-related terms, which may show their acquaintance with the target disciplines. They narrated their experiences in such a discipline-related manner that they could demonstrate they were disciplinarily prepared and disciplinarily capable although they changed their disciplines when pursuing further study. For example, in his personal statement, Yao tended to highlight the CS-related practices in his research projects (e.g. “we completed a program in $C { + } { + } ^ { { \bullet } } ,$ ; in Shirley’s personal statement, she tended to highlight the business-related practices (e.g. “I constructed the entire company’s organizational chart and business patterns”). What they gained from their experiences are a variety of abilities and qualities that may be indispensable in the target disciplines, for example, both “the ability to solve problem independently” and “teamwork ability” for Yao; “summarizing financial and economic statistics into useful information” and the “enterprising spirit” for Shirley. Besides the narration of discipline-related experiences, the description of their motivations and aspirations would also help Yao and Shirley voice their intended disciplinary identity. Their motivations for applying for the target programs and their aspirations for the future career are indeed inextricably related. They chose the target programs for further study exactly because they believed that these programs would help them in their future discipline-specific career development, computer science for Yao and biotech business management for Shirley.

Structurally, both Yao and Shirley followed the time order with three timescales involved, the past, the present and the future. Their difference lies in the sequence in which they arranged the timescales. While Yao used the conventional pastpresent-future sequence, Shirley put the future at the very beginning to highlight “a sense of purpose”. The past timescale is displayed in the narratives of the past experiences; the present timescale is exhibited by the writers’ motivations for applying as well as the writers’ current state of being; the future timescale is made evident in the writers’ aspirations. The narration of such a life story that encompasses the past, the present, and the future helps a writer to achieve the coherent identity across timescales because narratives enable one to construct a sense of a continuous self that mergers one’s past and future into one’s present identity (Bamberg et al., 2012, p. 180). Disciplinary identity construction across timescales in the personal statement echoes the notion of the identity construct introduced by Erikson who claims as follows:

The young person, in order to experience wholeness, must feel a progressive continuity between that which he has come to be during the long years of childhood and that which he promises to become in the anticipated future; between that which he conceives himself to be and that which he perceives others to see in him and to expect of him. (1968, p.87)

Therefore, voicing one’s experiences, motivations and aspirations across timescales would help writers maintain a sense of continuity and coherence over time in the construction of disciplinary identity.

Holistically, Yao and Shirley tried to create their own self-images, which reflected the construction of the potential disciplinary identity of being disciplinarily capable (of meeting the requirements of the target program, to say the least) and of being distinctive (through presenting his/her disciplinary capabilities in different aspects and displaying his/her unique characteristics). The disciplinary identity they intended to voice, that is, being a disciplinarily capable and personally unique applicant, confirms the findings of the previous studies. Ding (2007) concluded that personal statement writers tended to present themselves as both unique individuals and competent candidates. Li and Deng (2019) found that the personal statement writer aimed to construct the desired writer identity of a qualified and special applicant who would fit into the target program.

Since Yao and Shirley aimed to gain admission to the target programs, it is inevitable for them to be put under the constraints of the institutional requirements. The bottom-line institutional requirement is that the applicants should show their match with the target programs. Institutional requirements shape the experiences the writers chose to narrate in the writing. Yao and Shirley had to choose the most relevant experiences that would demonstrate that they were the right people for the target programs. There is no denying that the writers were driven by instrumental needs of getting admitted, but when they were “grappling with the personal statement”, “it was important to present what truly matters to them rather than what might possibly matter to the audiences they did not know” (Johns, 2017).

Abasi, Akbari and Graves argue that students’ awareness of the intersection of writing and identity aligns with their “socialization into their prospective disciplines” (2006, p.113). Building on Bourdieu’s (1984) concept of habitus, DressenHammouda discusses “the issue of disciplinary becoming”, which is defined as “the process by which students become recognized as members of a new disciplinary community (2008, p.234). Maclean regards the transition from a student identity to a professional identity in a legal skills program as “the process of accommodation” (2010, p.177). Hyland (2012) uses two terms proximity and positioning to explore the tension between conformity and individuality in one’s effort to gain membership into a target discourse community. He further describes gaining membership and carving an individual space as “the process of discipline coming” (2015, p.39). The personal statement writers’ attempt to show their match with the target programs reflects their endeavor to gain the disciplinary community membership. To achieve this purpose, they had to construct an identity as a competent candidate eager to pursue further study in the higher academic community. Such an identity is both personal and social. It is personal because a writer has to voice his/her unique personal experiences, motivations, aspirations, abilities and qualities which differentiate him/her from the other applicants. It is social because a writer has to voice the individual perceptions of his/her self as a potential member of the target disciplinary community by showing his/her match with the target program. “Both similarity to and difference from others, or assimilation to the group and differentiation from it, are central to identity” (Hyland, 2012, p. 10). The successful writers are able to achieve the integration of similarities and differences in their identity construction because their writing is centered around the coherent life stories that are unique to them. Those life stories, invariably, pertain to the disciplines they strive to pursue. In this sense, the identity they aim to construct is the disciplinary identity that reveals both disciplinary capabilities and personal uniqueness. To construct the identity of a capable and unique candidate, in essence, is to construct the intended disciplinary identity that would enable one to gain the membership of the target disciplinary community. It may account for the shift of the focus from “I” to the target program at the end of both Yao and Shirley’s personal statements.

# 6. Conclusion

It can be seen from the case studies that disciplinary identity can be enunciated at different voice levels in personal statement writing. Propositionally, the personal statement writers voiced their personal discipline-related experiences, motivations and aspirations. Structurally, the writers voiced across different timescales, thus achieving a sense of continuity and coherence in disciplinary identity construction. Holistically, the writers aimed to voice their self-images to construct the disciplinary identity of being a disciplinarily capable and personally unique candidate. Disciplinary identity voiced at different levels reveals the integration of both conformity to the target disciplinary community and distinctiveness from the application pool. The construction of such a disciplinary identity of being disciplinarily capable and personally unique would help one gain admission to the target disciplinary community.

Few previous studies have examined the construction of disciplinary identity involved in personal statement writing. This case study examined the ways in which disciplinary identity was constructed at three voice levels in two Chinese students’ personal statements. The present study can offer two pedagogical implications for the current academic writing in different contexts. First, the teaching and learning of academic writing should involve the negotiation of conformity and distinctiveness in order to help a writer to be acknowledged as a member with individuality in the disciplinary community and to help a writer to achieve “the professional in the personal” (Barton et al., 2004). Second, instead of giving general or vague instructions such as “express yourself”, “display your individuality” and “conform to the conventions”, we should specify the instructions to help our students voice themselves in different ways (i.e. explicitly and implicitly) and at different levels (i.e. propositionally, structurally and holistically). As Zhao suggests, in the perception of voice we should be concerned with the overall impression and pay attention to what and how writers wrote, which she expressed as “proper ways of voicing” (2019, p.119).

The case studies have made a detailed examination of disciplinary identity construction in two personal statements. The generalizability deserves further research. Applicable generalizations can be made by conducting some empirical studies of voice construction in classrooms and by incorporating more case studies of disciplinary identity construction in different contexts. For example, it would be worthwhile to compare the personal statements written by applicants with the same disciplinary background applying for programs of different disciplines as well as by applicants with different disciplinary backgrounds applying for the same program. Furthermore, due to “the opaque evaluations of personal statement” (Chiu, 2016, p. 57), the readers’ perspective was not discussed in our study. It merits further research to examine the coconstruction of disciplinary identity by taking into account both writers’ and gatekeepers’ perspectives. It is hoped that our case studies can stimulate further empirical research on disciplinary identity construction in different contexts.

# Appendix 2

# Yao’s personal statement

When I was in high school, I was a member of robot interest group, in which I became quite interested in Computer Science and Informatics. Thus, during undergraduate period, I’m quite interested in the research of Computer Vision, and completed one research project about detection and tracking of traffic signs study. I also kept excellent academic achievements in many subjects related to CS, especially in Data Structures, Database Principal Application, Object-Oriented Programming, Digital Image Processing, and Software Engineering and so on. All of these courses have helped me lay a solid foundation and an introduction of CS. From the variety of practical projects, I have mastered the professional knowledge and skills from many projects, as well as programming languages such as Java, C and ${ \mathsf { C } } { + } { + }$ . Moreover, my practical ability in programming was enhanced from creating one mobile service in internship. Below, I will briefly describe some of my past research, projects and practical experiences.

My initial interest in Digital Image Processing and Computer Vision was raised by some related courses and deepened through research where I exhibited solid mathematical and analytical skill. In my sophomore year, I participated in the research project of Rapid Detection of Traffic Signs based on Vehicle-Borne Mobile Mapping System, which was evaluated as State Key Technology Research and Development Program (863). In the phase one, in consideration of the current situation in China, most of the traffic signs are circular, thus we completed a program in ${ \mathsf { C } } { + } { + }$ and Opencv to realize the circular detection, traffic sign target identification, and applied Kalman filter in the process of inter-frame target prediction, achieving more accurate prediction and real-time location. My main contribution of this project was the design of algorithm. Specifically, I proposed a fast course location method based on image color information, and also used the HSV Space detection and corresponding color feature vector to guarantee the speed of detection. In line fitting, the coherence detection method was used to solve the problem of suspension due to one pixel. In ellipse fitting, more attributes of arc were used and combined with the clustering method to ensure the speed and accuracy of the fitting. I also apply the collinearity equation used in photogrammetry to confine the relationship between objects in space and on photos. Because of my core contribution, I was listed as the first author in our paper, which was submitted and published in International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS), July 2016. In the phase two, we now focus on the detection on the polygon, and try to use new methods such as particle filter and Meanshift to gain higher detection rate. It’s this research process that helps me have more insight of basic principles in Computer Vision.

While my undergraduate academic research orientation was image processing, I also find interest on software development. In my course project of Students’ Apartments Management System, as the team leader, after knowing every member’s strength and weakness, I assigned task to each member. As the developer, I enjoyed not only the object orientated programming in Java but the whole process of the projectdfrom requirement analysis and design specification to functional testing and bug tracking, such as, in the specification design, I learned how to use Rational Rose, a more powerful tool to ensure the consistency of the model and implementation. In the testing phase, I constructed the testing cases and conducted the white-box and black-box testing. Additionally, in the course project of Train Operation Management Software, in order to strengthen the team cooperation and improve the efficiency of project development, I proposed to use Github for version control and teamwork. I also wrote the code of clock, the core code to cyclical update the status of the train, and then updated train site information with it, finally displayed UI content according to the site information. Because of MVC pattern, we used in this project, any access to the current train data is the same, to get the information synchronization. Accordingly, my experience working in developmental teams resonates with my strong desire to contribute to practical applications.

My curiosity to explore the unknown of computer science is not confined to the classroom and academic life. I gained professional experiences and deep love in big data by taking a full-time internship in Asiainfo, the biggest independent big data company in China. The project I did was Real Time Query for Mobile Internet Traffic, a service provided by Hubei Mobile, aiming to improve customers’ satisfaction by allowing users to query their mobile internet traffic usage in real time, and develop more suitable product plan through big data analysis in users’ internet usage. In this project, I was first exposed to the HBase database, had a preliminary understanding of Hadoop ecosystem, and applied the SQL statement in real work environment. In coding part, after known the logical architecture of the query service, I used the Dquery service of HBase to solve the problem of interface calls failure. In the process of providing API to the outside, I applied the Spring-MVC framework to simplify the coding, and by modifying the configuration file to support JSON, XML and other formats file, to solve the frequent changes in the code due to the change of parameters format. Moreover, through the combined testing, delivery and document written work, not only improved my teamwork ability, but also strengthened my view of integrity and rigor of software development. The ability to solve-problem independently, cooperate with peers and supervisors effectively and to acquire new skills quickly will be applicable to my future master’s program, especially when conducting group projects. Besides, it also broadened my view about the usage of data in such a Big Data Era, which help me understand the importance of intersection with so many CS technologies and Information Technologies.

I regard the purpose of undergraduate education as to allow students to experience different things and in the meantime, try to find what they really want to do with their lives. After all these experiences and my weak background in my undergraduate study, I am glad that I have achieved the purpose and found something that I love and excel in. The industry of computer science is in its heyday, which is the field I want to engage in, and becoming a software engineer in a technology company would be a quite suitable choice as the beginning of my career path.

The SCM program in XXX University fits perfectly with my interests and career aspirations. Innovative and highly integrated, the program will provide me with the state-of-the-art knowledge in CS and the courses of Software Engineering, Algorithmic Analysis and Theory of Computation and Architecture and Systems Programming also appeal me. XXX University is definitely a good choice for me to pursue. Having always been preparing, I am confidently sure that your university will provide me the chances to fully foster my abilities and bring out the best in myself so as to make better performance. Therefore, I sincerely wish that my application would be favorably considered.

# Shirley’s personal statement

It is my aspiration to pursue a career in management, which is a strong interest and goal that I have set for myself since college. Being a senior at XXX University, I will soon earn my bachelor’s degree in Biological Science (major) as well as earning a minor in Economics. Over the past three years, I have witnessed the funding dilemma for biological research in China due to inaccurate marketing analysis, inadequate financial support, and poor management. Yet, I hope to make a change to improve the prospects for biological research. I intend to begin my career in the research division of an investment bank and provide reliable research on the biological industry. In the long run, I will strive to establish my own biotechnology company with the goal of bringing my expertise to make changes to improve the quality of life for everyone.

A postgraduate degree in management will deepen my understanding of the financial markets and give me access to advanced investment tools to reach my career goals. My undergraduate major programme in Biological Science has provided me with a solid foundation for work in the biological industry while my minor in Economics has helped me to learn about the dazzling business world. I have gained micro- and macro-economic knowledge from my economics courses to learn how to make sound financial decisions. Quantitative courses have equipped me with calculus and linear algebra knowledge and techniques, as well as statistical and econometrics skills, that are essential for rigorous training. In the course, Corporate Finance, I was exposed to various topics including investment portfolios and theories of financial decision making. I have also taken the courses, Econometric and Investment, to learn more about the investment decision-making process.

In the summer of 2015, I interned at the China Construction Bank. While serving as an assistant to the Corporate Credit Analyst, I mainly partook in evaluating firms’ credit worthiness and researching the biological industry. I analyzed quantitative data using Microsoft Excel daily and gradually became adept at summarizing financial and economic statistics into useful information. Meanwhile, I noticed due to inadequate collateral and credit policies inapplicable to high-tech enterprises, biotech companies in China were restricted access to bank loans and unable to secure enough capital for their innovative research projects. The good news is that China’s on-going financial reform encourages biotech companies to raise funds by attracting investment rather than acquiring loans from banks. To contribute to the development of China’s biological industry, I wish to conduct in-depth research and recommend promising biotech companies to investors who are interested in the industry, but unsure about its risks and prospects.

With the intention of gaining more practical experience in the finance sector, I have been working for the Wuhan Oryvane Biotechnology Co., Ltd., since March 2016, which was founded by two master’s students and two Ph.D. students from the College of Life Sciences at Wuhan University. This was not an ideal time to open a domestic market because the four founders had no ideas for how to star the business, but only to search clients from existing networks. Although difficult at first, I constructed the entire company’s organizational chart and business patterns as marketing director, even though the four cofounders did not have this information. Combining market capability and industry environmental analysis, while also refining market research and targeting customer segments were becoming my routine work. I also recommended excellent business students from university Accounting, Business Administration, and Marketing majors to join our group. Since then, we have signed four contracts to provide technical services for Insect Resistant Molecular Breeding in Rice. Our enterprising spirit has also earned us the Gold Award for the 2016 “Create Youth” National Undergraduate Business Plan Competition (Hubei District). This experience brought me great self-fulfilment and made me more determined to become an accomplished professional in management.

In addition, the variety of my extra-curriculum activities provided me with an abundance of valuable and personal experiences. Recent work for the Haitong Securities Co., Ltd., allowed me to learn how to conduct investigations and to apply and understand different analytical techniques. Serving as vice-chairman of the Student Union in the College of Life Sciences and organising large-scale cultural activities moulded my PR abilities and problem-solving skills. Also, my active involvement in a L’Oreal campus charity sale and Shennongjia Muyuzhen Research enriched my commitment to every work. All these experiences have taught me to remain calm in the face of adverse events for, behind any problem, there is always a great solution. On the other hand, I discovered my strong sense of responsibility. For example, there was a time when my entire team of Oryvane panicked, but I focused and stayed up late at night to solve the problems.

In summary, my previous endeavours have provided me with a foundation for achieving my career goal of becoming a professional management practitioner. These experiences have also revealed my deficiencies in systematic business theories and practical experience. Thus, to equip myself with prerequisites for management, I believe further study in your school remains indispensable. The MSc Management programme from the University XXX would offer a fantastic learning and practical environment for my future study with its well-experienced faculty. In the meantime, my experience in the biological industry could provide new perspectives for my classmates and enable me to contribute to the diversity of the class.
