# ABSTRACT

Keywords: Academic writing Compression Conventionalization Diachronic changes Lexical complexity

Previous diachronic studies of lexical changes in academic writing have focused on the evolution of specific sets or classes of words with specific grammatical or discourse functions, with no scholarly attention paid to diachronic changes in the overall lexical complexity of academic writing, a construct that has been shown to be closely related to text readability and writing quality. This study explores diachronic lexical complexity changes in academic writing based on a self-built corpus, the Corpus of Nature Biology Letters, comprised of 421 scientific letters sampled with ten-year intervals for 100 years (1929-2019). The corpus was analyzed for nine measures of lexical density, sophistication, and diversity to ascertain the trend and strength of lexical complexity changes. Our findings show that the patterns of diachronic changes in the lexical complexity of academic writing accord with the overall trends in academic writing towards greater compression and conventionalization. These findings add to our understanding of the evolution of the academic writing practices of the scientific community and may also have implications for academic writing pedagogy.

# 1. Introduction

Over the past few decades, a sizable body of research has examined the diachronic changes in the linguistic features, particularly grammatical or discourse-level features, used in academic discourse (e.g., Hundt & Mair, 199; Leech, Hundt, Mair, & Smith, 2009). Recent research in this area has also brought in the functional perspective to shed light on the inluences of registers and genres on diachronic changes in grammatical and discourse-level features inacademic iscourse (e.g., Biber & Gray, 2010, 2013, 2016; Hyland & Jiang, 2019a). Such research has provided empirical evidence in support of two important trends in academic language use over time. The frst i that of greater language compression, namely, a proces that reduces the amount of text used toconvey the same amount of information in an effrt to improve comunicative eficiency and clarity ., through the us of more concise words and phrases and the elimination of unnecessary or redundant expressions) (e.g., Biber & Gray, 2016; Leech et al, 2009). The second is that of greater language conventionalization, that is, the process of adopting and adhering to conventions of language use recognized as appropriate within a specific academic discourse community (e.g., Atkinson, 199; Baldwin, 2015). An understanding of these trends and the specific ways in which they manifest has useful implications for English for Research Publication Purposes (ERPP) pedagogy.

While it is not uncommon for existing studies to include analyses of historical changes in the frequencies of specific sets or classes o words that fulfil certain grammatical or discourse functions, studies of diachronic changes in the overall lexical complexity of academic discourse remain surprisingly scant. A multidimensional construct encompassing lexical density, sophistication, and diversity, lexical complexity has ben found to be indicative of text readability (e.g., Jin, Lu, Shi, & Su, 2021; Lu, Gamson, & Eckert, 2014) as well as second language (L2) production quality, proficiency, and development (e.g., Bulte & Housen, 2014; Eguchi & Kyle, 2020; Kyl & Crossey, 2015, 2016). An analysis of the historical changes in the various dimensions of lexical complexit in academic course could shed further light on the two aforementioned trends in academic language use. In particular, an upward trend in lexical density (i.e., a higher proportion of content words), lexical sophistication (e.g, an increased use of specialized words), and lexical diversity (i.e., a reduction in lexical repetition) could indicate greater language compression at the lexical level, while a downward trend in the degree of dispersion in these dimensions (i., reduced intertextual variation) over time could point to greater language conventionalization at the lexical level.

In light of the research gap and the important role of lexical complexity in language production in general and academic language in particular, the current study pursues an analysis of the diachronic changes in the lexical complexity of academic discourse. Spe. cifically, we first analyze a corpus of 421 biology letters sampled from Nature with 10-year intervals between 1929 and 2019 using a comprehensive set of lexical density, sophistication, and diversty indices. As detailed in Section 2.1, our focus on biology letters in Nature was primarily motivated by the long history and high prestige and impact of Nature, the fundamental importance of biology in science education and research as a core science discipline, and prominence of lettrs as the primary genre biology researchers employed to report their original reearch in Nature. To identify evidence for language compression, we use line graphs ofthe indices to ascertain the trends of their changes and Kendall's $\boldsymbol { \tau }$ correlation coefficients between the indices and time (Hilpert & Gries, 2009) to gauge the strength of these trends. To identify evidence for language conventionalization, we use violin boxplots (Larsson & Kaatari, 2020) of the indices along the normalized version of deviation of proportions $( \mathrm { D P _ { n o r m } } )$ , a measure of dispersion proposed by Gries (2008), tovisualize and quantify changes in the dispersion of these indices. While our analysis focuses on a specific genre of research writing in a single discipline, our findings willpotentially contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the diachronic changes in academic language use and shed light on whether the trends toward greater language compression and conventionalization observed in previous studies are manifested at the level of lexical complexity.

1.1. Diachronic trends toward language compression and conventionalization in academic writing

Studies of diachronic changes in the linguistic features of academic discourse have revealed two important historical trends in academic language use. The firs is the trend toward greater language compression in terms of the linguistic forms used. Academic writing has ben recognized as involving an information densification proces with genre-specific requirements to condense much important information into small textual and structural spaces (Biber & Gray, 2016; Leech et al., 2009). This \*impulse towards greater information density Lech et al., 2009, p. 234) has been gradually growing over time, as manifested in greater degres of structural compression in academic writing (Biber & Gray, 2010). For example, several studies have reported that the frequencies f predicate verbs and independent clauses in academic discourse have declined over time (Biber & Gray, 2016; Hundt & Mair, 199). At the same time, other studies have reported significant increases in the frequencies of nouns (including in particular nominalizations, e., acceptance) and noun phrases with one or more nouns as nominal pre-modifier (age group) and/or prepositional phrases as nominal post-modifiers (e.g, age group of 18-21 years) in academic writing (Biber & Gray, 2010, 2011). These findings corroborate the diachronic trend toward compressng information that could otherwise be conveyed in finite clausal structures into complex noun phrase structures in academic writing (Biber & Gray, 2013, 2016).

The second important historical trend in academic language use is that toward greater conventionalization in academic writing Based on diachronic analyses of modern scientific experimental research articles published in the irt English scientific journal, The Philosophical Transactions f the Royal Societ, over the period of 1665-1800, several early studies innovatively put forth the hypothesis that academic writing had gone through a rhetorical evolution toward conventionalization (Bazerman, 1985, 1988; Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995). Specificall, they pointed out that experimental research reports increasingly adopted the highly conventionalized Introduction-Methods-Results-Discussion (IMRD) structure and argued that conforming to such rhetorical structure conventions would benefit individual researchers participating in this scientific discourse community. Through a diachronic analysis of the research articles published in the same journal over the period of 1675-1975, Atkinson (1999) reported teady decreases in the use of narrative and persuasive language but substantial increases in the use of abstract language. He interpreted such diachronic changesssuggesting an increasing degre of conventionalization of these research articles toward styles that are es narrative and persuasive but more passivized. Atkinson (199) also hypothesized several other aspects in which academic writing was moving towards conventionali zation, including the tendencies for academic writers to describe experimental methods in greater detail, present results using visualizations, and adopt commonly-used rhetorical-structural organizations. Atkinson (1999) argued that this trend toward greater conventionalization could be linked to the shift of academic writing from a more expert-centered to a more community-centered practice. In a recent chronicle of the evolvement of Nature into the benchmark of scientific publication since it was launched in 1869, Baldwin (2015) offered rich insight into how changes in the nature of "scientific community' have resulted in changes in the nature of academic writing and the practices of scientific publication. She argued that Nature \*served as a site where editors, con. tributors, and readers could negotiate and construct the identity of the man of science" (p. 225) and such negotiations have translated into evolving criteria, expectations, and protocols of the journal that scientific community members co-establish and follow.

An understanding of the diachronic trends in academic language use and their specific manifestations at various linguistic and rhetorical-stuctural levels not only allows us to relate changes in the linguistic practices of academic writing to changes in the nature of the scientific community but also provides useful insight that could inform ERPP pedagogy (Baldwin, 2015; Hyland, 2016). For novice and emerging researchers who are aspiring to participate in and contribute to their target scientific discourse communit, it is especially important to help them develop an awareness of such trends and their manifestations and, more importantl, the compe. tence in employing appropriate linguistic resources to engage with these trends. Notably, studies of diachronic changes in the lexical complexit f academic discourse are rare. An analysis of such changes will contribute to our understanding of how the trends towards greater language compresson and conventionalization in academic discourse may be reflected at the level of lexical complexity and offer findings to support ERPP pedagogy concerned with vocabulary use in academic writing.

# 1.2. Measuring lexical complexity

In recent research, lexical complexity has been construed as a multidimensional construct, with lexical density, sophistication, and diversity seen as its three major subconstruct (e.g., Eguchi & Kyle, 2020; Kyle & Crossley, 2015; Lu, 2012; Read, 200; Wolf e-Quintero, Inagaki, & Kim, 1998). Lexical density is defined as the proportion of lexical words in a text (Harley & King, 1989; Ure. 1971). Given that lexical words carry semantic content, a higher lexical density can be taken to indicate a greater amount of information in a text. For this reason, it is probably not surprising that lexical density tends to be higher in written than in spoken texts (Halliday, 1985).

Lexical sophistication gauges the extent to which a text employs advanced or unusual words (Read, 2000. This subconstruct has often ben operationalized using frequency-based measures, based on the notion that higher-frequency words are les sophisticated as they are encountered more ften and are hence likely easier to lear (Bulte & Housen, 2014). Such measures may calculate the average frequency of the words in a text in a reference corpus eg., Kyle, Crossey, & Jarvis 2021; Lu et al, 2014) or examine the distributionof words across ifferen frequency bands (e.., Alghamdi, Gruba, & Velloso, 2022; Laufer & Nation, 1995; Lu, 2012), among ther ways. Aside from frequency, a number of other lexical properties have been considered relevant in assesing lexical sophistication. For example, the Tol for the Automatic Analysis of Lexical Sophistication (TAALEs) (Kyle & Crossley, 2015; Kyle, Crossley, & Berger, 2018) provides a comprehensive set of indices tapping into various types of lexical properties. One subset of indices treats academic words, words that are distributed in a narrower range of texts in a reference corpus, and words that occur in more distinctive contexts as more sophisticated (Kyle et l., 2018). A second subset f indices considers words with more unusual phonological or orthographical features as more sophisticated words (Andrews, 1989. Athird subset of indices treats words that are more specific or polysemous tobe more sophisticated (Crossey, Salsbury, & Mcamara, 2010). A fourth subset of indices considers words that are acquired or exposed to later in life by native speakers to be more ophisticated (e.g., Dascalu, Mcamara, Crossey, & Trausan-Matu, 2016). Finally, based on information from seral psycholinguistic datases a fith subset of indice trets words that ae processd more slowly, that aees familiar, imageable, or concrete, and that are more semantically isolated to be more sophisticated (Crossley & McNamara, 2011)

Lexical diversty measures the degree of variation or repetition of the words in a text. This subconstruct has traditionally been measured using type-token ratio (TTR; Templin, 1957), i.e., the number of word types divided by the number of word tokens in atext. Various variants of the TR have een put forth to address theffect of text length on the simple TTR measure, which tends to decrease as text length increases. The Tol for the Automatic Analysis of Lexical Diversty (TAALED; Kyle et al., 2021) can be used to compute the simple TTR as wellas many of its variants, such as MLTD, vocd-D, and HD-D (Malvern, Richards, Chipere, & Duran, 2004; McCarthy & Jarvis, 2010).

In the current study, we interpret diachronic increases in lexical density, sophistication, and diversty as indicators of a trend towards greater language compressions on the basis that texts with a greater proportion of content words and specialized words and a lower degree of lexical repetitio likely carry a higher dege of informational density. We will use line graphs (with linear regression trendlines) of lexical complexity indices to visualize trends in their historical changes and Kendall's $\boldsymbol { \tau }$ correlation coefficients between lexical complexit indices and time t ases the strength of such trends see Section 2.3). Atkinson (1999) asessed the diachronic trend toward conventionalization by tracking changes in the ranges of the mean values of individual texts at different time points Which could be sustantiall ffected y extreme outliers in the dataset. To alleviat this limtation, we will employ vioin oxplots and Gries' (2008) $\mathrm { D P } _ { \mathrm { n o r m } }$ measure of lexical complexity indices to visualize and quantify diachronic changes in their dispersion (see Section 2.3). A reduction in dispersion in the lexical complexity indices can be interpreted as indicative of a trend towards greater language conventionalization at the lexical level.

# 1.3. Research questions

In light of the research gap identified above, the current study aims to investigate the diachronic changes in the lexical complexity of academic writing, using a self-compiled corpus of biology research articles in the ltter category published in the jounal Nature in the period of 1929-2019. Building on recent progressin the multidimensional approach to understanding and measuring lexical complexity, we employ a comprehensive set of measures of exical density, lexical sophistication, and lexical diversity to address the following specific research questions.

(1) How did the lexical density of Nature biology letters evolve over the period of 1929-2019? (2) How did the lexical sophistication of Nature biology letters evolve over the period of 1929-2019? (3) How did the lexical diversity of Nature biology letters evolve over the period of 1929-2019?

# 2. Method

# 2.1. Corpus data

Our data consisted of the Corpus of Nature Biology Letters (CNBL), a collection of 421 letters in biology published in Nature from 1929 to 2019. The journal Nature was chosen because of is long history (first published in 1869) and high academic reputation and impact (Baldwin, 2015). As of November 18, 2022, the journal's two-year and five-year impact factors reached 69.504 and 63.580, respectively, per its oficial website. Our focus on the discipline of biology was motivated by two reasons. First, along with physics, chemistry, and mathematics, biology is considered a core science discipline that is fundamentally important in science education and research (Hills, Heller, Hacker, Hll askowski, 2020). As such it has en investgatd in multiple dachronc studies of academic discourse(e.g., Biber & Gray, 2010, 2016; Hyland & Jiang, 2018, 2019a, 2019b; Leech et al., 2009), allowing for comparisons between our and previous findings. Second, biology studies have been covered by Nature since its establishment with a fairly clear and stable disciplinary boundary, making it possible to examine the evolvement of it language use over a long period of time. Letters in Nature are short original reearch reports that discus important novel findings with fewer details than full research articles. This genre was chosen because of its importance to biology researchers as the primary genre they use to report their original research in Nature. Furthermore, ltters represent the most prominent article type in Nature overal, utumbering all other aticle types and allowing for adequate samples to be drawnfor biology in our observation period. The authors first language (L1) background was not considered in the sampling processbecause the primary concern of our analysis was the conventions and practices of the disciplinary communit as a whole rather than of L1 English authors.

To build up the diachronic corpus, we randomly sampled leters from Nature at 10 time points, that is, from 1929 to 2019 with 10. year intervals. We decided on even and much shorter intervals than those used in most previous diachronic studies (Lei & Yang, 2020) to capture more fine-grained changes in the lexical complexity of biology lettrs in Nature over the 100-year period. Table 1 summarizes the descriptive statistics of the corpus. Due to the limited number ofartices published in Nature in the early twentieth century, we exhaustively sample all biology letters published in 1929 (61 letters), 1939 (60 letters), and 1949 (60 letters). The letters published after 1949 became increasingly longer over time; wethus sampled fewer leters from 1959 onwards in order to balance the total size and number of samples in the 10 subcorpora to the extent possble, while maintaining a minimum of 30 letters per subcorpus to ensure an adequate sample size for reliable statistical analysis and generalizations (Hyland & Jiang, 2018; 2019a). The downloaded PDF files were converted to plain tex file. Some of the earlier leters that could not bedirectly aved as plain text files were handled either through manual typing or through optical character recognition followed by manual checking. Following the common practice in similar corpus compilation efforts (e.g., Hyland & Jiang, 2018, 2019a; Lu, Yoon, & Kissele, 2021), we removed the following components from each letter as they were considered to be either irrelevant to or potentiall problematic for our analysis: paren. thetical components of in-text citations, tables, figures, biological formulas, references, acknowledgements, and supplementary materials.

# 2.2. Lexical complexity measurement

For each sample in our corpus, we computed nine lexical complexity indices (see Table 2) automaticall using TAALEs (Kyle et al. 2018) and D (Kyl et al., 2021). Both tools are publicly avalable for fre, are capable f analyzing a large bach of files using the many measures they integrate eficientl, and have been validated by many previous studies that employed them to analyze the lexical complexity of diffrent types of texts (e.g., Eguchi & Kyle, 2020; Kyle & Crossey, 2016; Lu & Hu, 2022; Zhang, Lu, & Li, 2022). The nine indices were selected based on three considerations to ensure the comprehensiveness and generalizaility of our results. First, it was neessry o over allth tict uconstcts f lc complet ., exil dity, sohistication, ndivrt. econd for lexical sophistication, we intended to represent diffrent types of lexical properties usedto define sophisticated words (e.g., Kyle et a., 2018) as wellas complementary approaches used to model some types of exical properties. Third, we also intended to capture complementary approaches used to assess lexical diversity.

The lexical density index, Lexical density types, is calculated by dividing the number of ontent word types by the total number of word types in the text. The six lexical sophistication indices were selected to cover four diffrent types of lexical properties used to define sophisticated words. KF Freq_AW_Log and cOCA_Academic Frequency Log_AW constitute two complementary referencecorpus frequency indices: the former is logarithm of the average frequency score of all words in the text whose frequency scores are available in a general-purpose corpus, ie., the Brown Corpus) (Kucera & Francis, 1967), and the later i the logarithm of the average frequency score of all words in the text whose frequency scores are available in the academic subcorpus of the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA; Davies, 2009).KF Nsamp_AW and COCA Academic Range Log AW are two complementary reference-corpus range indices. The former is the average range (i.e., the number of documents containing a word in therference corpus) score of al the words in the text whose range scores are available in a general-purpose corpus (ie., the rown Corpus), and the latter is the logarithm of the average range score of all the words in the text whose range scores are available in the ademic subcorpus of COCA. The last two lexical sophistication measures capture acquisitional and psycholinguistic properties,respectively. Kuperma n_AoA AW is the average AoA score of al words in the text whose AoA scores are available in Kuperman, Stadthagen-Gonzalez, and

Finall, two complementary lexical diversty indices were selected based on previous findings regarding their reliability against the text length effct and their validity in relation to human judgments of lexical diversity (e.g., Kyle et al., 2021; McCarthy & Jarvis, 2010). The mtld original aw index is based on the average number of word tokens in a text it takes to achieve a given TTR value (0.720), and mtld ma bi aw is the version of MTLD that takes a moving-average approach to calculate the index. Further details of these measures can be found in the manuals of TAALES (Kyle et al., 2018) and TAALED (Kyle et al., 2021).

# 2.3. Statistical analyses

We performed four types of statistical analysis to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the patterns of diachronic change in lexical density, lexical sophistication, and lexical diversty over the period of 1929-2019. First, for each of the nine lexical complexity measures, we plotted the mean values at the 10 time points onto a line graph using Excel 2022 to directly visualize the changes of the mean values over the time pan. Previous diachronic studies have aso frequently presented line graphs for simiar purposes .g, Biber & Gray, 2013, 2016), although more commonly based on larger (e.g., 50-year or 100-year) and sometimes uneven intervals that may leave some fluctuations unaccounted for see, e.g., Lei & Yang, 2020). Our even and shorter 10-year intervals have the potential of capturing the rises and falls in a more fine-grained way. Furthermore, we also added a trendine to each line graph to hel capture the overall trend or direction of hange of the lexical complexity measure over time. This was done through the linear rgression procedure by taking al the data points on the line graph and finding the straight line that minimizes the sum of the distance between each data point and the line itself. This line provides us with the best estimate of the overall direction (eg., upward, downward, or flat) of the data points.

Fig. 1. Changes of mean lexical density values.

Second, we calculated the Kendall's $\boldsymbol { \tau }$ correlation coefficients between each of the nine lexical complexity measures and time (Hilpert & Gries, 2009) using spss 29 to evaluate the strength of its diachronic change. Previous studies have commonly measured diachronic change strength i terms of the perentage gap in the mean frequency of usage ofte linguistic feature in question between the beginning and end of the target time period (e.g., in our case, this would be 1929 and 2019, respectively) (e.g., Hyland & Jiang, 2017, 2018; 2019a, 2020). The direct comparison of frequencies at the first and last time points may be "les than optimal" (Gries, 2006, p. 2) when it comes t capturing the proces of diachronic change. By taking into consideration time and the value of the measure at each time point, Kendall's $\boldsymbol { \tau }$ provides a more robust measure of the strength of diachronic change in multistage diachronic corpora.

Third, we generated violin boxplots for each of the nine lexical complexity measures at each time point using GraphPad Prism 8.3.0 to visualize diachronic changes in the dispersion of the value of that measure over time. Changes in dispersion have been rarely examined in previous diachronic studie f academic discourse. Larsson and Kaatari (2020 illustrated how violin boxplots visualizing the dispersion in the complex nominal per clause measure among the texts in their dataset can provide insight into the degree of conventionalization in academic discourse. In aviolin boxplot (se, e.g., Fig. 2), each grey dot denotes a unique data point the red line indicates the median, and the area between the two blue lines corresponds to the inter-quartile range. The length of the violin boxplot represents the range, which is afected y mild outier eyond the first and third quartile and extrme outier at the upper and lower ends. The width and shape of the violin boxplot reflect the distribution shape of the data, with a wider section representing a higher probability for a oints to take on  specifi value ., hgher datoin density or that valu) and a skinner sction rreenting a lower probability. For the same measure, a reduction in dispersion may result in a violin boxplot with a shorter length, narrower interquartile range, and/or wider sections around the median or the interquartileregion. We interpret the tendency for the violin boxplots for the same measure to exhibit such changes in length and shape over time as evidence for a diachronic trend toward conventionalization for that measure. With a much fullr representation of data distribution (including outliers), violin boxplots allow for more nuanced observations of diachronic changes in data dispersion than tracking changes in the ranges of the mean values of individual texts over time (e.g., Atkinson, 1999).

Finally, we calculated Gries' (2008) $\mathrm { D P } _ { \mathrm { n o r m } }$ measure for each of the nine lexical complexity indices at each time point using Excel 2022 to quantify changes in the dispersion of the value of that index over time. The DP measure was initiall proposed to asess the dispersion of a inguistic element (.g, a word in different corpus parts in tems of the extent to which the observed perentages of the linguistic element in question in different corus part diffe from the xpected perntages. Grie (2008) showed that this measure can "distinguish between different degrees of 'most extreme distributions" (p. 418). We calculated the $\mathrm { D P } _ { \mathrm { n o r m } }$ measure for each lexical. complexity index at each time point using the equation in (1) (Burch, Egbert, & Biber, 2017; Gries, 2008):

$$
D P _ { n o m } = \frac { \frac { 1 } { k - 1 } \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { k } \left| Y _ { i } - \overline { { Y } } \right| } { 2 \overline { { Y } } }
$$

In this equation, $k$ denotes the number of samples at that time point, $Y _ { i }$ denotes the value of the lexical complexity index for the ith sample at that time point, and $\overline { { Y } }$ denotes the mean value of the lexical complexity index for all samples at that time point. $\mathrm { D P } _ { \mathrm { n o r m } }$ ranges from 0 to 1, with a larger number indicating greater data dispersion among the corpus parts. We interpret a downward trend in the $\mathrm { D P } _ { \mathrm { n o r m } }$ measure of a lexical complexity index as evidence for a diachronic trend toward conventionalization for that index.

# 3. Results

In this section, we report the results on the diachronic changes of lexical density, lexical sophistication, and lexical diversity in Nature biology ltters over the 1929-2019 period. Table 3 summarizes the formulae and R-squared values of the trendlines in the line graphs for the nine lexical complexity measures, Table 4 summarizes the Kendall's $\boldsymbol { \tau }$ correlation coefficients between the lexical complexity measures and time, and Table 5 summarizes the $\mathrm { D P } _ { \mathrm { n o r m } }$ values of the trendlines for the nine lexical complexity measures.

# 3.1. Lexical density

The line graph in Fig. 1 visualizes the directions of the changes of the mean lexical density values of the samples across the 10 time points. The trendline in the graph indicates an upward trend of lexical density from 1929 to 2019 $\boldsymbol { R } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 6 3 3 )$ , although the graph also shows two small decreases from 1939 to 1949 and again from 2009 to 2019, each following a large increase in the previous decade. The strength of the positive diachronic change is high $\zeta \tau = 0 . 6 1 7$ $p < . 0 0 1 $ ) (see Table 4), indicating that overall, the proportion of lexical words in Nature biology letters has undergone significant, large increases over the 100-year period. The violin boxplot in Fig. 2visualizes the diachronic changes in the dispersion of the lexical density values of the samples across the 10 time points.? The shapes of the violin boxplots remained largely stable over time and thus did not display any obvious trend toward conventionalization in terms of the lexical density of Nature biology letters from 1929 to 2019. The $\mathrm { D P } _ { \mathrm { n o r m } }$ values of the lexical density measure fluctuated over time; however, compared to the values in the first half of the 100-year period, those in the second half appeared to be lower overall.

# 3.2. Lexical sophistication

To address research question two, we report the results on the six lexical sophistication measures inthis section. As indicated by the trendline in the line graph in Fig. 3, KF_Freq_AW_Log shows a clear downward trend over time $( R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 4 0 3 )$ . The strength of the negative diachronic change is medium $\left( \tau = - 0 . 4 8 1 \right.$ $p < . 0 0 1 $ (see Table 4), indicating that overall, the reference-corpus frequency of the words used in Ntre biology leters has decreased significantly acrossthe 100 year. Furthermore, Fig. 4 shows an verall tendency for the violin boxplots to become shorter with narrower interquartil ranges and wider sections around the median or the interquartile region over time, suggesting a trend toward conventionalization in terms of the overall reference-corpus frequency of the words in Nature biology letters from 1929 to 2019. The $\mathrm { D P } _ { \mathrm { n o r m } }$ values of this measure fluctuated over time, but overall the second half of the 100-year period showed lower values in this measure than the first half.

For the COCA Academic Frequency Log_AW measure, the trendline in the line graph in Fig. 5 shows a clear downward trend $( R ^ { 2 } =$ 0.9421). The strength of the negative diachronic change of this measure is medium $\pmb { \tau } = - 0 . 4 9 2$ A $p < . 0 0 1 )$ (see Table 4), indicating that overall the rference-corpus frequency of the academic words used in Nature biology leters has undergone significant, moderate decreases over time. The violin boxplot in Fig. 6 visualizes the diachronic changes in the dispersion of the cOCA AcademicFrequency Log_AW values of the samples acros the 10 time points. Over time, the violin boxplots appear to have increased in width around the median decreased in length, with the inter-quarter range lines trending closer around the median. Extreme outliers have graduall disappeared over time, and the number of mild outliers has decreased over time, as well. These changes suggest a trend toward conventionalization in terms of the reference-corpus frequency of academic words of Nature biology leters from 1929 to 2019. The $\mathrm { D P } _ { \mathrm { n o r m } }$ values of this measure were overall also lower in the second half of the 100-year period than in the first half, with some fluctuations.

The trendlines in the line graphs in Figs. 7 and 9 show that the two-word range measures (for KF_Nsamp_AW, $R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 2 0 6$ for COCA_Academic_Range_Log AW, $R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 2 4 8 )$ both decreased from 1929 to 2019. The negative correlations between the two measures and time, although weak, were both significant (for KF_Nsamp_AW, $\tau = - 0 . 0 8 7$ $p = . 0 1 3$ ; COCA_Academic_Range_Log AW, $\tau = - 0 . 2 6 5 , p$ $< . 0 0 1 $ (see Table 4), indicating that the overall reference-corpus range of all the words as well as of academic words used in Nature biology leters has gradually become significantly narrower over time. The violin boxplots in Fig. 8 and 10 suggest diachronic trends toward conventionalization for the two word range measures, with those for the most recent decades (particularly 1989-2019) becoming shorter, showing narrower interquartil ranges, and/or exhibiting wider sections around the median or interquartile region. The $\mathrm { D P } _ { \mathrm { n o r m } }$ values of both measures trended lower in the second half of the 100-year period than in the first half.

The trendline in the line graph in Fig. 11 shows that the Kuperman AoA_AW measure has increased over time $( R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 9 4 4 4 )$ However, this measure is not significantly correlated with time $\left( { \tau = 0 . 0 4 2 } \right.$ $p = . 2 2 6 )$ (see Table 4), indicating that overall, the age of acquisition of the words used in Nature biology leters has stayed largely stable over time. The violin boxplots in Fig. 12 suggest a gradual redction in outlier and greater data density around the median over time, with someobvious flctuations (e.g, in 1989.The $\mathrm { D P } _ { \mathrm { n o r m } }$ values of this measure clearly trended lower in the second half of the 100-year period than in the first half.

The trendline in the line graph in Fig. 13 shows that the MRC Familiarity AW measure has decreased over time $( R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 8 7 2 4 )$ . This measure is weakly but significantly correlated with time $\tau = - 0 . 1 6 5$ A $p < . 0 0 1 $ ) (see Table 4), indicating that overall, the words used in Nature biology letters have gradually become signficantly les familiar over time. The violin boxplots in Fig. 14 show no notable diachronic trend toward conventionalization for the word similarity measure, as their lengths and shapes remaining largely stable, although the last two decades saw a reduction of extreme outliers. The $\mathrm { D P } _ { \mathrm { n o r m } }$ values of this measure also stayed largely stable across the 100-year period.

# 3.3. Lexical diversity

To answer research question three, we present the results for the two lexical diversty measures (i.e., mltd original aw and mltd ma_bi aw). The trendlines in the line graphs in Fig. 15 show an overall rising trend for both measures (for mltd original aw, $R ^ { 2 } =$ 0.5073; for mltd ma_bi_aw, $R ^ { 2 } = 0 . 6 5 0 3 )$ , with notable increases occurring between 1989 and 2019. The positive correlations between the two measures and time, although weak, were both significant (for mltd original_aw, $\tau = 0 . 1 3 4$ $p < . 0 0 1$ ; for mltd_ma_bi_aw, $\tau =$ 0.194, $p < . 0 0 1 $ , indicating that the reference-corpus range of the academic words as wellas of all the words used in Nature biology letters has become slowly but significantly more diverse over time. Figs. 16 and 17 suggest a mild diachronic trend toward conventionalization for the two lexical diversity measures in the earlier decades, particularly from 1929 to 1989. The violin boxplots for the two measures both show a tendency to become gradually shorter over time during this period, although further reduction in length is not observed in the most recent decades. The $\mathrm { D P } _ { \mathrm { n o r m } }$ values of these two measures both trended lower in the second half of the 100-year

# 4. Discussion

This study employed nine measures chosen to represent three dimensions of lexical complexity, namely, lexical density, sophis tication, and diverst to analyze a diachronic corpus of biology leters published in Nature between 1929 and 2019. This analysis was performed to gain an understanding of the patterns and trends of lexical complexity changes in academic writing over this 10-year period with 10-year interval. Line graphs with trendlines and Kendall's correlation cofficients were used to ascertain the directions and strengths of change for the lexical complexity measures, respectively, and violin boxplots and the $\mathrm { D P } _ { \mathrm { n o r m } }$ measure were used to visualize and quantify changes in the dispersion of the lexical complexity measures. While some variation exss among the results for the nine measure, overall, our results revealed significant increases in the lexical density, sophistication, and diversity of Nature biology leters over the 100-year period as wellas notable trends toward great language compression and conventionalization.

With respect to our first research question, the lexical density measure showed significant, large increases from 1929 to 2019, indicating that over time the proportion f content words (., nouns, vers, adjectives, and adverbs) used in Natre biology ltters has become larger. Given that ontent words carry more information than function words (Read, 200), texts with a larger proportion of such words condense more information than those with a smaller proportion of such words. Previous studies have reported diachronic increases in language compressonat the grammatical or structural level in academic writing (Biber & Gray, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2016; Leech et al. 2009). Our finding adds evidence for the trend toward greater language compression in academic writing at the overall lexical density level. The analysis of changes in overall lexical density conducted in the current study and that of changes in fine-grained lexical categories conducted in previous studies usefully complement each other: the former provides a holistic sense of changes in information density, whil the later ofers insight into the specific ways in which such changes manifest, such as the in. crease in the frequencies of nouns and noun modifiers (Biber & Gray, 2010, 2011) and the decrease in the frequencies of predicate verbs (Biber, Finegan, & Atkinson, 1994; Hundt & Mair, 199). In addition, the increase in lexical density likely interacts with the increase i structural compression observed in previous research, particularly the increased use of modified noun phrases, as greater use of such phrases not only increases head nouns but also the density of modifiers, including noun and adjectival pre-modifiers and possibly adverbs modifying adjectives as well.

Regarding our second research question, the consistent results from six lexical sophistication indices reflecting different distr. butional, aquisitional, and psycholinguistic properties of words confirm significant diachronic increases in the lexical sophistication of Nature biology ltters from 1929 to 2019. Specificlly, the reference-corpus frequency and range f ll words as well a of all academic words used in these ltters have decreased significantly over time, indicating a greater tendency for the authorsof these letters to use les common and more specialized words. At the same time, the overall AoA ratings of the words used in these ltters have increased over time, whil the overall familirity ratins have decreased indicating a greater tendency for the authors of these letters to use more words that are acquired latr in life by L1 speakers and that are les familiar to L1 speakers. While the use of more content words contribute to language compression in a quantitative sense, the use of more specialized or domain-specific words can be interpreted as contributing to language compression in a qualitative sense in that they carry more specific information than domaingeneral words. The diachronic trend towards using more specialized words aligns with Baldwin's (2015) observation that science has been seen as a much more demanding and specialized pursuit in later years than in early ones. This can be illustrated by Examples (1) and (2). In both examples, the authors are highlighting their novel contribution relative to previous studies, but Example (2) packs more information with more lower-frequency and specialized words (e.g., contradictory, biodiversity, inhibit, invasions) than Example (1).

For our third research question, the results from the two lexical diversity indices in our findings consistently indicate significant diachronic increases in the lexical diversity of Nature biology etters from 1929 to 2019. Previous research has found a strong rela. tionship between lexical diversty and writing quality (e.g., Crossey, 2020; Jarvis, 2002; Yu, 2010), and the increase in lexica diversity in Nature biology ltters may well reflect the authors' continuous efforts to met the qualitystandards of the increasingly competitive publication threshold (e.g., Flowerdew, 2015). The increase in lexical diversity can be said to work in tandem with the increase in lexical density and sophistication to support the diachronic trend towards greater language compression in that a higher level of lexical diversity is also more likely to correspond to a higher level of information density.

While some variations exist among the nine lexical complexity measures in terms of the diachronic changes of their dispersion as represented by their violin boxplots and $\mathrm { D P } _ { \mathrm { n o r m } }$ values, the lexical sophistication (with the exception of the word familiarity index) and diversity indices exhibited a diachronic trend toward greater conventionalization between 1929 and 2019, as evidenced in the gradual reduction of their dispersion over time, with fluctuations. Previous research has demonstrated a diachronic trend toward conven. tionalization in rhetorical organization and reporting styl (Atkinson, 1999; Bazerman, 1985, 1988; Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995), and our findings suggest that greater use of more sophisticated and more diverse words is becoming an important part of the conventions of academic writing as wll It has been argued that fllowing the onventions of ascientific community not only enables the community to achieve maximal efficiency in terms of information exchange but also helps individual authors to consolidate their identity as members of the scientific communit (Atkinson, 199; Bazerman, 1985, 1988; Berkenkotter & Huckin, 1995; Dear, 1985) Given that Nature can be seen as "a forum where a community of like-minded individuals could talk to one another and discuss the intellectual and social issues affecting scientific work" (Baldwin, 2015, p. 18), authors who contribute to the journal may wellbe motivated to follow the conventions established by Nature's scientific community over time for these benefits. Furthermore, some changes in the social-cultural context of academic writing may have contributed to the trend toward greater conventionalization, to. For example, advances in electronic tchnologies have reshaped the writing and editing proces and promoted the use f tandardized English in published research articles (Biber & Gray, 2010). The increasing adoption of standard style and reference guides (e.g., APA) on academic writing by the academic publishing industry has also likely contributed to the increasing degre of conventionalization. Additionall, increasingly easier accessto previously published research has prompted an exponential rise in citations in research articles over time (Hyland & Jiang, 2019b), potentiall promoting aimilation to conventions. Following the conventions of Natue may also be seen to be especially important by its large number of second language and/or first-time contributors (Monastersky & Noorden, 2019).

# 5. Conclusion

As the firt reearch attempt to examine the diachronic changes in the overall lexical complexit of academic writing, the present study has found significant increases in the lexical density, sophistication, and diversity of Nature biology letters over the 100-year period of 1929-2019. These increases show that the diachronic trend toward greater language compression in academic writing is also manifested in different dimensions of lexical complexity. Furthermore, our analysis also showed a gradual reduction in the dispersion of multiple lexical sophistication and diversity indices over time, sugesting that the increased use of more diverse and sophisticated words may be becoming part of the conventions of the scientific community. These results usefully complement findings from previous analyses of diachronic changes in the rhetorical, grammatical, and discourse-level features of academic writing.

Our findings support the notion that information density has become increasingly greater in academic writing through language compression, reflecting an increasingly more competitive publication threshold and at the same time leading to greater dificulty and processing demands especiall for non-specialized readers. They also show the evolving nature of the practices and conventions of the scientific community and the continuous eforts of members of the scientific community in adapting and adhering to those evolving conventions. Our findings pertaining to how the trends towards greater language compression and conventionalization in academic discourse are refected at the level of lexical complexity can usefully inform ERPP pedagogy concerned with vocabulary use in academic writing. In particular, it i important to help novice and emerging reearchers develop an awarenessof the importance of lexical density, sophistcation, and diersity in academic writing and, more importantly, the aility to appropriatly employ a diverse range of academic and specialized vocabulary from their field of research.

Several important directions for future research exist. First, future studies can validate the findings of the current study by analyzing academic writing from other disciplines and sources. Second, we did not systematically examine or control for topic effect but relied on random sampling to minimize this ffect (i.e, the topics of the articles at all time points were expected to be diverse). However, as one reviewer rightfully pointed out, historical changes in research topics and the potential effect of such changes on lexical complexit changes could be usefully investigated. Third, bulding on the quantitative findings of the diachronic trends of the current study, a more in-depth analysis of the socio-cultural factors driving such diachronic trends could be performed to achieve a deeper understanding of the nature of the evolvement of the practices and conventions of the scientific understanding. Finall, the impact of the diachronic trends toward greater language compression and conventionalization on the authors, readers, and the sci. entific and social impact of published research need to be investigated, taking into account of the increasing importance of knowledge accessibility, multilingualism, diversity, and inclusion in science education and communication.
