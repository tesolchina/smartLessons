# ABSTRACT

The present paper aims to investigate the interplay of lexical and grammatical development in school-aged Greek-Albanian bilingual children by providing evidence both from majority, Greek, and heritage, Albanian. To this end, 47 8 to 10-year-old bilingual children were tested by means of expressive vocabulary tests in Greek and in Albanian, while their grammatical skills were evaluated by means of the LITMUS Sentence Repetition Task administered in both languages. Additionally, input-related measures in both languages, such as oral language practices, literacy, and educational practices were used to assess the bilingual experience and examine how it would correlate with lexical and grammatical skills. The analysis showed that within each language, lexical and grammatical skills were closely related both for the majority and the heritage language, while when examining across-language effects, grammatical skills in the heritage language were correlated with grammatical skills in the majority language. Concerning the role of input, we found that input in the heritage language supported skills both in the heritage and the majority language. The study’s contribution is that by providing novel evidence from this specific language pair it shows that supporting the use of heritage language can boost language skills in both languages.

# 1. Introduction

The present paper aims to investigate the interplay of lexical and grammatical development in school-aged Greek-Albanian bilingual children by providing evidence both from the majority language, i.e. Greek, and the heritage language, i.e. Albanian. By ‘heritage language’ we refer to a native language that is part of the bilingual’s heritage culture and one which is not the dominant/majority language of the community (Montrul 2016). The contribution of this work to the field is that it examines both languages of the bilinguals in an attempt to shed light to the complex interplay between language growth across domains (vocabulary, grammar) and environmental input-related factors that modulate language development at a domain-specific and overall linguistic level (Tsimpli 2014). Importantly, this investigation concerns two languages that have not been extensively explored in heritage language research where the emphasis is often placed on English as the majority language and Spanish as the heritage language1 and adds to our understanding of the dynamics of bilingual development. Additionally, the languages examined in this paper share similarities but also differ at the morphosyntactic level; they belong to different language groups, which makes the investigation of the associations between grammar and the lexicon within and across languages more challenging. Focusing on some basic properties of the languages,2 Greek and Albanian are both morphologically rich languages marking person and number on the verb as well as number and case on the noun and allowing flexible word order (for Albanian see Demiraj 2002, for comparisons between Greek and Albanian, see Kyriazis 2001). Earlier theoretical studies suggest that Albanian and Greek share similar patterns of subordination (Koça and Pojani 2016; Kurani and Trifoni 2014), however, there are syntactic differences such as clitic structures; specifically, Albanian allows clitic doubling (Demiraj 2002) in contrast to Greek which allows both clitic doubling and clitic left-dislocation (see Philippaki-Warburton et al. 2004). Albanian is a largely understudied language and very little research has been conducted so far with regard to morphosyntactic development in monolingual Albanian-speaking children. It is also important to note that Albanian is the heritage language of many bilingual children in Greece today (Mattheoudakis, Chatzidaki, and Maligkoudi 2020), hence it is crucial to understand both the relation between growth in Albanian and Greek as well as the impact of the environmental factors on bilingual language development for this population.

There is ample evidence that lexical and grammatical development are strongly correlated in language growth, especially in the early years, irrespective of whether researchers support that lexical/ semantic growth drives grammatical growth or the other way around. This strong association between lexical and grammatical skills has also been attested for children acquiring more than one language (Hoff, Quinn, and Giguere 2018; Valentini and Serratrice 2021). However, findings are controversial as to whether lexical and grammatical growth in bilinguals is associated more strongly within the same language, i.e. lexical skills in language A affecting grammatical skills in language A (Gagarina and Klassert 2018; Prevoo et al. 2016) or whether this relationship is strong across languages as well, i.e. lexical skills in language A affecting grammatical skills in language B (Simon-Cereijido and Gutiérrez-Clellen 2009). This lack of consensus can be attributed to the diverse design of the studies since there is variation both with regard to the populations tested in terms of age and languages involved and with regard to the tools employed for language testing. Simon-Cereijido and Gutiérrez-Clellen (2009), for example, examined the interdependence of lexical and grammatical domains within and across languages in preschool and school-age Spanish/ English bilingual children and found strong positive correlations between lexical and grammatical measures within each language, but no significant correlation across languages, since lexical development in one language was not found to affect grammatical development in the other. However, there is evidence that within the same domain, bilingual language skills in one language support language skills in the other language, i.e. grammatical skills in language A support grammatical skills in language B (Leider, Proctor, and Silverman 2021; Proctor, Harring, and Silverman 2017) and lexical skills in language A support lexical skills in language B (Armon-Lotem, Rose, and Altman 2021; Monsrud et al. 2022; Prevoo et al. 2016; Sierens et al. 2019). For example, Proctor, Harring, and Silverman (2017) carried out a longitudinal study on the relation between Spanish and English examining lexical and morphosyntactic skills. Specifically, they tested 156 bilingual L1 Spanish/ L2 English school-age children from grade 2 to grade 5 and found that early Spanish syntax predicted oral language skills in English at a later age. Similar results were reported by a more recent study by Leider, Proctor, and Silverman (2021) who examined the language growth developmental trajectories in the same population, Spanish L1/ English L2 school-aged children. The results showed that Spanish syntax was a significant predictor for morphosyntactic skills in English.

Turning to the role of input-related factors, Sierens et al. (2019) examined the linguistic interdependence of receptive vocabulary skills in emergent bilingual Turkish speaking children attending Flemish preschool and found that Turkish L1 vocabulary size was a significant predictor of Dutch L2 vocabulary size, while age, preschool grade, and L2 use at home positively affected L2 vocabulary development. Additionally, Prevoo et al. (2016) conducted a meta-analysis of 86 studies including

23,049 bilingual children with an immigrant background evaluating the relation between the heritage and the majority language. As regards vocabulary knowledge, the analysis reported that strong cross-language relations were stronger in studies where vocabulary was used as a proficiency measure. As regards input-related measures the meta-analysis revealed that early literacy and reading in one language supported the relevant practices and skills in the other language. These findings are important since they show that there is no competitive relation between the two languages of a bilingual, but rather development in one language supports development in another language.

This is critical for heritage language support practices, since there is a common misconception on the competitive relation between a bilingual’s two languages which often results in the heritage language being abandoned in favor of the majority language [see the extensive discussion of the issue in Hollebeke et al. (2022) and for Greek-speaking settings Maligkoudi, Tolakidou, and Chiona (2018)]. Notice additionally that in most of the studies reviewed by Prevoo et al. (2016) English was the majority language, and the heritage language was mainly Spanish, while in only a few cases they examine data on other heritage languages, like Chinese and Urdu. This underlines the pressing need to conduct more bilingualism studies on less studied languages such as the pair under study here, Greek and Albanian.

While there are several studies that examine the interrelation between lexical and grammatical knowledge in bilinguals with English as one of their native languages, there are only few studies on Greek speaking bilinguals that target the following: (a) possible associations across domains (i.e. vocabulary – grammar) and within domains (i.e. vocabulary in language A – vocabulary in language B) and (b) possible correlations of language domains across languages (i.e. vocabulary in language A – grammar in language B) (see Kaltsa, Prentza, and Tsimpli 2020). In the few studies that lexical and grammatical measures were used in both languages of the Greek-speaking bilinguals, the emphasis was on the comparison between language skills in language A and language B, mainly vocabulary skills, and not on the investigation of possible interrelations within and across languages and domains. An investigation of this sort would highlight the interdependence of language development in bilinguals rather than the competitive relation between the two languages or the operationalization of language measures to assess dominance. For example, Kaltsa et al. (2017) used vocabulary knowledge in Greek and Albanian as a measure of overall language proficiency so as to determine language dominance, while Dosi, Papadopoulou, and Tsimpli (2016) used vocabulary scores in Greek and Albanian as a screening measure. Apart from recent studies examining Greek/Albanian bilinguals (see for example, Andreou et al. 2021; Dosi, Papadopoulou, and Tsimpli 2016; Kaltsa et al. 2017; 2020; Peristeri et al. 2020; Prentza et al. 2019; 2022; Simos et al. 2014) research that includes heritage speakers of Albanian is very rare.

One example is a recent study conducted in Norway by Monsrud et al. (2022) who compared L1 and L2 receptive and expressive vocabulary skills in 542 bilingual children of an immigrant background aged 6–13 years, with Albanian being one of the six heritage languages tested. The results showed that while children’s L1 and L2 vocabulary skills increased with age, there was a significant gap between the range of Norwegian vocabulary known by monolingual and L2 children. However, when an additive conceptual scoring approach was used which considered the L1 vocabulary growth, the gap between monolinguals and bilinguals closed or even disappeared. Note also that the Albanian/Norwegian bilingual children had higher vocabulary scores compared to the other heritage participants; this finding was associated to the frequent use of Albanian within the family that appeared to support the overall bilingual vocabulary growth.

Vocabulary tasks, expressive and productive, have been widely used in bilingualism research as a measure of bilingual children’s lexical skills. As regards the factors that modulate lexical development in bilingualism, besides any correlation effects between vocabularies in the two languages, research has shown that overall vocabulary growth is particularly sensitive to input. Measures of input quantity have been used to explain variation in vocabulary development in both the L1 and the L2 (Hoff et al. 2014). A number of recent studies that examined vocabulary development in immigrant children do underline the impact of input-related measures such as home language, current language use, literacy and bilingual educational practices to vocabulary growth (Gagarina and Klassert 2018; Ribot, Hoff, and Burridge 2018; Ryan 2021; Thordardottir 2019).

With respect to overall grammatical development in bilingualism, this has been widely assessed by means of Sentence Repetition (SR) tasks (Kaltsa, Prentza, and Tsimpli 2020; Marinis and ArmonLotem 2015; Peña et al. 2018; Prentza et al. 2022). SR tasks are complex linguistic task that reflect the language processing systems at a variety of levels: speech perception, lexical (vocabulary) knowledge, grammatical skills and speech production and, thus, have been argued to constitute a single language latent ability factor (Polisenska, Chiat, and Roy 2015). However, in many studies, SR tasks are used to assess only one of the languages of bilinguals, usually the majority one (Andreou et al. 2021; Dosi, Papadopoulou, and Tsimpli 2016; Kaltsa, Prentza, and Tsimpli 2020; Makrodimitris and Schulz 2021). As regards the factors that affect SR performance it has been shown that both vocabulary and input-related measures impacted on grammatical skills (Kaltsa, Prentza, and Tsimpli 2020; Komeili et al. 2020; Makrodimitris and Schulz 2021; Pratt, Peña, and Bedore 2021; Simon-Cereijido and Méndez 2018). For example, for Greek, the recent study of Kaltsa, Prentza, and Tsimpli (2020) on Greek/Albanian bilingual children reported that Greek SR performance was moderately related to Greek vocabulary skills, as well as home language, current oral language use and literacy practices in Greek. In another recent study with Greekspeaking bilinguals, Makrodimitris and Schulz (2021) examined Greek heritage children’s ability using the same SR task as the Kaltsa, Prentza, and Tsimpli (2020) study and found that current language use of Greek at home significantly affected SR performance. Note that the impact of lexical skills on SR performance has also been attested in studies examining other language pairs. For example, Simon-Cereijido and Méndez (2018) and Pratt, Peña, and Bedore (2021) examined English/Spanish bilinguals and found that SR performance in both languages was primarily predicted by expressive vocabulary skills in each language.

However, the results of studies that contrasted SR performance across-languages are not as straightforward; in some cases SR performance in language A differs from performance in language B, as bilinguals fall within the monolingual norm in one language but not the other (see AntonijevicElliott et al. 2020 on English/ Irish bilinguals; Meir and Armon-Lotem 2017 on Russian/ Hebrew bilinguals). Nevertheless, in a recent study, Blom et al. (2021) investigated possible SR performance correlations and not merely contrasts in the languages of the bilinguals. Specifically, they examined the grammatical skills of Syrian children aged 6–12 years old in Syrian-Arabic and in English and found that L1 and L2 correlated provided that children’s exposure to the L2 was sufficient.

Considering the above, the present study aims to explore the complex interplay between lexical and grammatical skills in the majority and heritage language of school-aged bilingual children, as well as to consider the impact of the multilingual practises that drive lexical and grammatical development in this population. Specifically, given the scarcity of relevant research in Albanian bilinguals in particular, we will examine whether grammatical and vocabulary development in Greek, the majority language, and Albanian, the minority language, are in any way interrelated and how the bilingual language experience may be driving bilingual language development overall.

# 2. Materials & methods

# 2.1. Bilingual language experience

Forty-seven 8–10 year-old bilingual children participated in the study $( \mathsf { M } = 8 ; 9$ and $\mathsf { S D } = 0 ; 6 ; 2 9$ girls, 18 boys). All bilingual children are raised in an immigrant context, in which Albanian is their heritage language and Greek is the majority language. Participants were recruited in Northern Greece; specifically, in the cities of Thessaloniki and Ioannina. We contacted the Directorate of Primary Schools in these two areas; subsequently, we informed the school principals and educators and lastly, we reached out to parents/guardians. For a child to be included in the study, the requirement was to have at least one parent who is a native speaker of Albanian. Note also that children that experience developmental difficulties were excluded from the study during recruitment.

To assess the bilingual language experience of our participants, to determine the age of onset of exposure to the majority and the heritage language along with information on the quantity and quality of input, we administered an ethnographic background questionnaire (Matthaioudakis, Chatzidaki, and Maligoudi 2014). Both children and their parents/guardians provided information on the child’s country of birth and/or child’s age of arrival to Greece along with home language practices questions on their upbringing in early childhood and their current language exposure and use in relation to both the heritage and the majority language. The questionnaire was provided both in the majority and heritage language and participants selected the one they felt more comfortable with.

To operationalize the components of the bilingual experience documented via the questionnaires, we developed five key indices per language; the Home Language index, the Early Literacy Preparedness index, the Current Language Use index, the Literacy Practices index, and the Educational Practices index. The Home Language index refers to the children’s exposure to each language from birth up to the age of schooling, i.e. around 6. The Early Literacy Preparedness index examines the shared book-reading practices during the pre-school years. The Current Language Use index measures the participants’ current daily language preference/use in oral tasks such as discussing with family and friends, recalling phone numbers, telling the time, counting/calculating, watching TV/movies. the Literacy Practices index evaluates the children’s current language preference in writing and reading tasks, such as writing lists/letters/cards, reading aloud, texting, emailing, visiting websites, playing video-gaming, reading books/magazines in the heritage and majority language respectively. The Educational Practices index provides information on the literacy skills in each language. Given that our participants attend monolingual state schools, they received instruction in Greek for $3 0 \mathrm { h }$ per week, while the hours of instruction in Albanian ranged between 0 and $5 \mathrm { ~ h ~ }$ per week depending on whether the school had reception classes4 where children are taught Language and Mathematics in Albanian (N: 8), or whether they attended afternoon/Saturday classes in the heritage language (N: 9). Table 1 summarizes the relevant information:

# 2.2. Cognitive screening

All participants were additionally screened via three cognitive tasks. Specifically, we administered the Raven’s Progressive Matrices Test as basic cognitive functioning measure for non-verbal intelligence $\langle M = 2 3 . 3 4$ , $S _ { \mathrm { { D } } } = 4 . 4 2 _ { \cdot }$ ), the Digit Span Backwards Recall Test of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) as a verbal working memory measure $( M = 1 0 . 3 8 _ { i }$ , $S \mathsf { D } = 3 . 6 5$ ), and Mister X as a visuospatial working memory measure $( M = 9 . 6 0$ , ${ \mathsf { S D } } = 2 . 9 5$ ). No participant was excluded from the study due to limited cognitive resources.

# 2.3. The assessment of vocabulary development

To measure children’s vocabulary abilities all bilingual participants conducted a standardized expressive vocabulary task in Greek and a similar task in Albanian. An expressive vocabulary task was selected on the grounds that expressive measures highlight the individual differences among bilinguals better than a receptive vocabulary measure would (Hoff et al. 2014). Both the Greek and the Albanian vocabulary tasks are adaptations of the Renfrew Word Finding Vocabulary Test (Renfrew 1995). In both adaptations, there are 50 black and white pictures presented to the child one at a time, items increase in difficulty and the same discontinuation rules are followed. Specifically, the participant is awarded one point for every appropriate lexical item and zero points when no item or an inappropriate one is provided. Testing is discontinued when the child fails to respond correctly in five consecutive trials. The overall administration time is approximately 5–7 min. The expressive vocabulary test employed for Greek was developed and standardized by Vogindroukas, Protopapas, and Sideridis (2009). The expressive vocabulary test employed for the heritage language was developed by Kapia and Kananaj (2013) and is not yet standardized.

# 2.4. The assessment of grammatical development

For the assessment of grammatical development, we employed the Litmus Sentence Repetition Task (SRT hereafter) in Greek and Albanian. The SRT was developed within the COST Action IS0804 ‘Language Impairment in a Multilingual Society: Linguistic Patterns and the Road to Assessment’ funded by the EU RTD Framework Programme – guidelines outlined in Marinis and Armon-Lotem (2015). Children were tested individually in a quiet room at their schools and listened to the sentences via headphones. The task was presented as a treasure hunt game with the child listening to each sentence once and repeating it as accurately as possible.

The Greek-SRT tests eight structures; SVO sentences, sentences containing factual and nonfactual negation (NEG), structures with clitics in clitic left dislocation (CLLD) and clitic doubling (CD) contexts, complement clauses (COMPLCL) introduced with the complementizes oti and pu, coordinated sentences (COORD), adverbial clauses (ADVCL), referential and non-referential wh-questions (WHQ), and subject and object relative clauses (RC). Each sentence type included four sentences making a total of 32 test items. All sentences were matched for length and word frequency. Examples per structure are provided in Table 2:

The Albanian-SRT examines 10 structures and includes 60 test items presented with incremental difficulty. The structures tested are SVO with one auxiliary/modal and with negation (SVO), clitic doubling (CD), subject and object wh-questions (WHQ), short actional passives, long actional and nonactional passives (PASSIVES), double negation (DNEG), adjective–noun agreement and subject-verb agreement (AGR), bi-clausal sentences with coordination or with complement/adjunct clauses (BIC), conditionals (CONDITIONALS), center embedded and right branching relative clauses (RC) and noun phrase complements (NP COMPL). Examples per structure are provided in Table 3:

As noted earlier, items are presented incrementally at three levels of difficulty; easy (Level 1), medium (Level 2) and hard (Level 3). Each level of difficulty assesses a different set of structures following the patterns of monolingual acquisition in Albanian. At Level 1, the task assesses SVO, subject/object wh-questions, short actional passives and clitics. At Level 2 it assesses subject-verb agreement, noun–adjective agreement, long passives, double negation and bi-clausal sentences and at Level 3 relative clauses, noun taking complements, conditionals, and bi-clausal sentences (incl. coordination). The Albanian SRT is developed by Enkeleida Kapia following the general principles of the Litmus SRT construction.

Two types of scores were extracted; an accuracy score and a grammaticality score following the scoring procedure of the SR subtest of the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals (fourth edition) (CELF-4; Semel, Wiig, and Secord 2003). With regard to the accuracy score a score of three points was awarded for each exact repetition of a target sentence with no errors. A score of two points was given, if an utterance included one error, a score of one point if an utterance included two errors, and a score of zero, if an utterance included three errors or more. For the Greek-SRT the scoring scale ranged from 0 to 96 points and for the Albanian-SRT from 0 to 180. The accuracy scoring is quite strict yet highly sensitive to differences among varied populations. Grammaticality scoring on the other hand, is a more relaxed measure since it evaluates responses on grounds of their (un)grammaticality in each sentence while not assessing the degree of similarity to the prompt sentence. Participants were awarded a score of one point for every grammatical utterance they produced and a score of zero for every ungrammatical one. This scoring resulted to a scoring scale from 0 to 32 points for the Greek-SRT and from 0 to 60 points for the Albanian-SRT.

# 3. Results

# 3.1. Overall performance

First, we examine the overall performance on vocabulary and grammatical measures. Table 4 summarizes the bilingual’s performance:

A paired-samples T-test was conducted to compare the participants’ performance in the language measures in the heritage and majority language; to minimize any variability effects in the dataset zscores5 were used for the statistical analysis – see Figures 1–3.

The analysis of the vocabulary scores revealed that vocabulary development in the majority language is significantly ahead of the vocabulary development in the heritage language; $t ( 4 6 ) =$ $- 4 . 6 5 1$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $d = . 8 8 9$ . The analysis of the SRT accuracy scores, however, showed a moderate advantage of the heritage language over the majority; $t ( 4 6 ) = 1 2 . 4 5 4$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , $d = . 4 3 4$ . The analysis of the SRT grammaticality scores, though, showed the reverse pattern to accuracy results, mirroring the lexical development findings with significantly better attainment in the majority language; t(46) $= 1 0 . 8 9 5 , p < . 0 0 1$ , $d = 2 . 0 9 6$ . These finding on grammatical development suggest that depending on the type of measurement employed (accuracy or grammaticality) we record different language development trends of varied effect that require further analysis so as to comment on bilingual development overall. Next we move to what can help us predict the development of the heritage and majority language in bilinguals.

# 3.2. Predicting language development: the analysis model

The statistical analysis of the dataset was conducted using R 4.1.0 (R Core Team 2020). We performed least-squared regression6 analysis to test the significant predictors of the bilinguals’ lexical and grammatical development. Our dependent variables were (a) vocabulary, (b) SRT accuracy, and (c) SRT grammaticality measures both in the heritage and the majority language, Albanian and Greek respectively. Our independent variables were the aforementioned measures along with Home Language (HL), Early Literacy Preparedness (ELP), Current Language Use (CLU), the Literacy Practices (LP), and Educational Practices (EP) indices in both languages.

As a first step to our analysis we conducted a Pearson correlation assessing the relationship among language measures and input indices so as to identify the parameters that appear to boost language development. Heritage vocabulary was shown to positively correlate with both Heritage SRT measures (Accuracy: $r ( 4 7 ) = . 5 9 1$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ ; Grammaticality: $r ( 4 7 ) = . 6 8 7 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ ) as well as the Heritage CLU index $r ( 4 7 ) = . 3 1 1$ , $p = . 0 3 3$ . The majority vocabulary also had a significant positive correlation with both SRT scores in the majority language (Accuracy $r ( 4 7 ) = . 5 0 4$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ ; Grammaticality $r ( 4 7 ) = . 5 1 1$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ ) as well as the Heritage LP index, $r ( 4 7 ) = . 3 0 0$ , $p = . 0 4 1$ .

Turning to the grammatical measures, the analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between SRT accuracy and grammaticality. Specifically, when looking within each language accuracy and grammaticality measures showed a close relationship with higher scores in one measure leading to higher scores in the other measure (Heritage: $r ( 4 7 ) = . 9 3 0 , p < . 0 0 1 $ ; Majority: $r ( 4 7 ) = . 6 8 8 , p < . 0 0 1 ;$ . Interestingly though a strong positive relation was revealed also when looking cross languages since Majority SRT accuracy correlated positively both with the Heritage SRT accuracy $( r ( 4 7 ) = . 4 2 0$ , $p$ $= . 0 0 3 )$ and the Heritage SRT grammaticality measures $( r ( 4 7 ) = . 2 9 2$ , $p = . 0 4 6 )$ . Those results allowed us to proceed with the regression analysis of those parameters so as to additionally assess their predictive value.

Lexical development in heritage & majority languages.

For the regression analysis there were six different models testing three measures in both languages. For all of them we started with a saturated model (i.e. all selected variables) and we simplified the model by process of backward elimination following the procedure recommended by Crawley (2007). First, we fit the full models which contained all independent variables. Next, we removed predictors one by one. After the removal of any predictor, we performed log-likelihood ratio tests in order to test the model fit, in other words, to examine if the predictor had a significant effect and whether it should be kept in the model. In the case of an insignificant effect, the predictor was removed, and this process was repeated until no further predictors could be removed, with the adjusted ${ \mathsf { R } } ^ { 2 }$ being the main criterion for our model selection. The final models are presented within this section.

# 3.3. Predictors of vocabulary development in the heritage & majority language

Starting with vocabulary development in the heritage language, the final model (adjusted $R ^ { 2 } =$ . 485, $F ( 2 , 4 4 ) = 2 2 . 7 1$ , $p < . 0 0 1 _ { \cdot }$ ) explains $4 8 . 5 \%$ of the variance and includes Heritage SRT grammaticality (β $= . 4 2 7$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , Tolerance $=$ .967, $\mathsf { V I F } = 1 . 0 3 3 \mathrm { \Omega }$ ) and Heritage CLU index $( \beta = . 1 0 9 , p = . 0 7 8$ , Tolerance $= . 9 6 7$ , ${ \mathsf { V I F } } = 1 . 0 3 3$ ) as the most significant predictors. When it comes to vocabulary in the majority language, the resulting model (adjusted $R ^ { 2 } = . 3 4 7 , F ( 3 , 4 3 ) = 9 . 1 5 1 , p < . 0 0 1$ ) explains $3 4 . 7 \%$ of the variance and the predictors are Majority SRT accuracy $( \beta = . 1 0 7$ , $p = . 0 6 5$ , Tolerance $=$ .524, ${ \mathsf { V I F } } = 1 . 9 0 5 { \mathrm { } }$ , Majority SRT grammaticality $( \beta = . 3 7 1$ , $p = . 0 9 0 $ , Tolerance $=$ .523, $\mathsf { V I F } = 1 . 9 0 8 )$ and Heritage LP index $( \beta = . 2 1 6 , p = . 0 1 9 ,$ , Tolerance $=$ .999, ${ \mathsf { V I F } } = 1 . 0 0 4 )$ ). The results suggest that vocabulary development is closely linked to grammatical development both in the heritage and in the majority language. Additionally, vocabulary skills in the heritage language are supported by enhanced use of the heritage language for daily oral tasks and better literacy skills in the heritage language predict better vocabulary skills in the majority language.

# 3.4. Predictors of grammatical development in the heritage language

The model for the Heritage SRT accuracy (adjusted $R ^ { 2 } = . 8 8 3 , F ( 2 , 4 4 ) = 1 7 5 . 8 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ explains $8 8 . 3 \%$ of the variance with the Majority SRT accuracy $( \beta = . 2 7 2$ , $p = . 0 0 3$ , Tolerance $=$ .914, ${ \mathsf { V I F } } = 1 . 0 9 3$ ) and Heritage SRT grammaticality $( \beta = 2 . 8 2 , p < . 0 0 1$ , Toleranc $\mathsf { \Omega } : = . 9 1 4 , \mathsf { V I F } = 1 . 0 9 3 )$ being the most significant predictors. As for Heritage SRT grammaticality, the resulting model explains $8 9 . 2 \%$ of the total variance (adjusted $R ^ { 2 } = . 8 9 2 , F ( 3 , 4 3 ) = 1 2 8 . 3 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ with the predictors being Heritage vocabulary $( \beta = . 2 9 2$ , $p = 0 0 3$ , Toleranc $\mathsf { \Omega } ^ { \mathsf { \Omega } } = . 6 2 4 , \mathsf { V I F } = 1 . 6 0 2 )$ and SRT accuracy in the majority $( \beta = . 0 4 4$ , $p = . 1 2 9 $ , Tolerance $= . 7 8 9$ , ${ \sf V I F } = 1 . 2 6 6 )$ and the heritage language $( \beta = . 2 6 6$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , Tolerance $= . 5 1 9$ , VIF $=$ 1.926). The predictors identified in the models suggest (a) lexical knowledge in the heritage language supports grammatical development and (b) better grammar skills in the majority language also predict better performance in grammatical tasks in the heritage language.

# 3.5. Predictors of grammatical development in the majority language

Moving to data of the majority language, the model for the SRT accuracy explains $5 8 . 1 \%$ of the total variance (adjusted $R ^ { 2 } = . 5 8 1 , F ( 4 , 4 2 ) = 1 6 . 9 9 , p < . 0 0 1 )$ and includes the variables Majority vocabulary $( \beta = . 7 4 0 , p = . 0 2 7$ , Toleranc $\mathsf { \Omega } : = . 7 2 2 , \mathsf { V I F } = 1 . 3 8 3 )$ , Majority SRT grammaticality $( \beta = 1 . 7 1 6 , p < . 0 0 1$ , Tolerance $\ Q = . 6 6 6 ,$ $\mathsf { V I F } = 1 . 5 0 0 $ ), Heritage SRT accuracy $( \beta = 0 . 4 7 3$ , $p < . 0 0 1$ , Tolerance $= . 1 2 4$ , ${ \sf V I F } = 8 . 0 3 6$ ) and Heritage SRT grammaticality $( \beta = \mathrm { ~ - ~ } 1 . 0 3 1$ , $p < . 0 0 5$ , Tolerance $= . 1 2 8$ , $\mathsf { V I F } = 7 . 7 5 7 $ ). Lastly, the final model for Majority SRT grammaticality explains $4 8 . 7 \%$ of the variance (adjusted $R ^ { 2 } = . 4 8 7$ , $F ( 2 ,$ $4 4 ) = 2 2 . 8 8$ , $p < . 0 0 1 )$ and includes Majority vocabulary $( \beta = . 1 6 9 $ , $p = . 0 7 8 ,$ Tolerance $= . 7 4 5$ , ${ \mathsf { V I F } } =$ 1.341) and Majority SRT accuracy $( \beta = . 1 5 3 , p < . 0 0 1$ , Tolerance $= . 7 4 5$ , ${ \sf V I F } = 1 . 3 4 1$ ) as its most significant predictors. Similarly to the regression analysis of the heritage grammar data, the majority grammar data suggest that lexical knowledge in the majority language supports grammatical development and improved grammar skills in the heritage language are closely related to better grammar skills in the majority language advocating a strong interplay between the two language systems in bilingual development.

# 4. Discussion

The present paper aimed to revisit the interplay of lexicon and grammar in bilingual development via the examination of both heritage and majority language in school-aged Greek-speaking bilinguals who are heritage speakers of Albanian. Most studies so far have focused on English as a majority language and Spanish as the heritage language; however, to fully comprehend the dynamic interplay of bilingual development it is crucial to add datasets from other languages as well. Our analysis focuses on two languages, Albanian and Greek, that belong to different language groups with several individual grammatical differences, yet they are both morphologically rich and they allow flexible word ordering. Albanian in particular is a language of great interest since it is largely understudied with regard to monolingual and bilingual development (for description of Albanian grammar see Demiraj 2002) and it is a heritage language spoken by many bilingual children in Greece (see also Mattheoudakis, Chatzidaki, and Maligkoudi 2020). Even though the individual one-to-one grammatical differences of the two languages are outside the scope of the present analysis, we consider the overall lexical and grammatical assessment of this population both in the majority and heritage language as critical in the discussion of bilingual language development.

To meet this aim, we measured children’s vocabulary abilities employing the Greek and the Albanian adaptations of the Renfrew Word Finding Vocabulary Test (Renfrew 1995); meanwhile to assess grammatical development, we utilized the Litmus SRT in both languages. An SR task was selected due to the fact that a variety of language levels are involved and as such it provides a good measure for overall grammatical attainment. Additionally, given that both lexical and grammatical growth has been associated to input-related factors (see Gagarina and Klassert 2018; Kaltsa, Prentza, and Tsimpli 2020; Makrodimitris and Schulz 2021; Pratt, Peña, and Bedore 2021; Ribot, Hoff, and Burridge 2018; Ryan 2021; Thordardottir 2019; Tsimpli 2014), we operationalized components of the bilingual experience focusing on heritage and majority oral language use overall early in life and currently, literacy preparedness and current literacy practices in both languages along with measurements on the educational practices and examined the impact of those factors on heritage and majority language development.

The cross-language analysis of the dataset showed that bilinguals had significantly higher scores in the majority language than the heritage language with regard to expressive vocabulary and SRT grammaticality measurements but higher scores in the heritage language than the majority language with reference to the SRT accuracy measurement. The advantage of bilinguals in the majority expressive vocabulary over the heritage one was also attested by previous research in Albanian-speaking populations (Dosi, Papadopoulou, and Tsimpli 2016; Kaltsa et al. 2017) and the more complex picture on the SRT measures was also attested in previous studies (Antonijevic, Durham, and Chonghaile 2017; Meir and Armon-Lotem 2017). It is important to note that the type of measurement used, grammaticality vs. accuracy, provides different types of information with regard to language ability. The accuracy measurement in particular is a far stricter measurement and, therefore, it provides a better insight with regard to grammatical growth. As such, our results which were based on analysis of variance provided an insight on the sensitivity of each type of measurement of the study (see also Kaltsa, Prentza, and Tsimpli 2020; Prentza et al. 2022). Note though that these data did not provide any information about what is the relation between the two language systems, what drives bilingual development and which factors can boost lexical and grammatical growth in particular. For the exploration of these issues, we turn to the rest of the analyses conducted.

When looking within a language and across domains, earlier research has reported a strong association between lexical and grammatical skills (Gagarina and Klassert 2018; Prevoo et al. 2016). When looking across languages and within a domain (lexical or grammatical), previous findings suggest that bilingual language skills in one language support language skills in the other language (Armon-Lotem, Rose, and Altman 2021; Castilla, Restrepo, & Perez-Leroux, 2009; Leider, Proctor, and Silverman 2021; Monsrud et al. 2022; Prevoo et al. 2016; Proctor, Harring, and Silverman 2017; Sierens et al. 2019). The correlation and regression analysis performed on our dataset verify those findings. Starting with the relationship of the lexical and grammatical domain both for heritage and majority language, the analysis showed that enhanced vocabulary skills provide support to grammatical development. Moreover, when looking across languages within a domain we found positive association between majority and heritage grammatical systems since higher attainment in one language was strongly associated to higher attainment in the other language which validates the findings by Proctor, Harring, and Silverman (2017) and Leider, Proctor, and Silverman (2021) who tested Spanish/English speaking bilinguals with different language assessment tools.

This close and positive relationship of the languages in bilingual development was further enhanced by our findings on the role of input-related factors. Previous research has shown that input modulates lexical and grammatical development in bilinguals (Armon-Lotem, Walters, and Gagarina 2011; Blom et al. 2021; Komeili et al. 2020; Kaltsa, Prentza, and Tsimpli 2020; Makrodimitris and Schulz 2021; Pratt, Peña, and Bedore 2021; Simon-Cereijido and Méndez 2018; Tsimpli 2014). The examination of the role of bilingual language experience indices in boosting language growth revealed the key role of the heritage language input for the development of both majority and heritage language. Specifically, vocabulary development in the heritage language can be predicted by the Heritage CLU index, that is oral input in the heritage language, while vocabulary development in the majority language can be predicted by the Heritage LP index, that is written input in the heritage language.

This finding on the impact of input-related measures such as current language use in vocabulary growth is largely expected and has been extensively reported (Gagarina and Klassert 2018; Ribot, Hoff, and Burridge 2018; Ryan 2021; Thordardottir 2019). Nevertheless, the key role of literacy development in the heritage language that we identified as a key predictor for vocabulary development in majority language needs to be central in the discussion of bilingual development. A similar finding is hinted by the meta-analysis of Prevoo et al. (2016) which reviews Spanish/English datasets and our data provides further support in that direction from a different language pair.

Turning next to grammatical development in the heritage language, the data analysis showed that apart from enhanced lexical skills in the heritage language, better grammar skills in the majority language can have a supportive role. Meanwhile, the majority SRT data also showed the same pattern, since lexical knowledge in the majority language supported grammatical development in the majority language and enhanced grammar skills in the heritage language boosted grammar skills in the majority language. These findings clearly suggest that there is a strong interaction between that two grammars and even though some of the earlier research suggested that bilinguals tend to fall within the monolingual norm in one language but not the other (Antonijevic-Elliott et al. 2020; Meir and Armon-Lotem 2017) or that the amount of exposure to the language tested affects performance in SRTs (Blom et al. 2021; Makrodimitris and Schulz 2021). Our regression data analysis suggests that language growth itself can be the predictor with heritage grammar supporting the majority grammar and vice versa. This finding provides further support to earlier work that reported language skills in one language supporting language skills in the other language (see Armon-Lotem, Rose, and Altman 2021; Leider, Proctor, and Silverman 2021; Monsrud et al. 2022; Prevoo et al. 2016; Proctor, Harring, and Silverman 2017; Sierens et al. 2019).

Overall, our data show that policies supporting the use of heritage language and the development of better literacy skills in the heritage language can boost vocabulary skills in both languages of a bilingual. Additionally, grammatical development in the heritage language can support and not hinder grammatical development in the majority language. Furthermore, the evidence this study provides advocates that classic measurements of input such as age of exposure and amount of input to each language separately may not be as informative since they do not necessarily predict grammatical development in bilinguals. On the other hand, a more detailed evaluation of the interplay between the two grammatical systems provides a better insight to the dynamics of bilingual development.
