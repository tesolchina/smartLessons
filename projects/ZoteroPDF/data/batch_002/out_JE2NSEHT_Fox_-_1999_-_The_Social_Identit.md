# The Social Identity of Management Ergolect

Renata Fox

Abstract—Management, a group of considerable social influence, is in the privileged position to create through verbal means a defined public image. It is, therefore, reasonable to expect managerial language to be used largely for sociorhetoric purposes. So far English in international management has been investigated unsystematically, generally as a part of Business English. This has meant highlighting its transactional dimension and neglecting its social identity. Using computational analysis of a text corpus, this paper describes and analyses selected lexical, discourse and stylistic elements of English in international management, essential for the public identification of management and the manager. $©$ 1999 The American University.

# 1. Introduction–Global Managers are Made Not Born

Listening to senior international managers’ discourse, we notice that besides talking shop-bids, mergers and takeovers—managers absolutely relish talking about themselves. These are examples:

1. We put in place a management team that lacked the standard business tools, Kux explains. But their ambition was incredible. You could feel their hunger to excel . . . Each project was led by a champion–some from top management ranks, some from the other \`\`hungry wolves''.   
2. I proposed a partnership. If we invested in a factory together, he would know we couldn't arbitrarily close it if our business took a nose-dive because we would also have something to lose. We shook hands and were in business– much to the chagrin of Stride Rite's lawyers.   
3. Global managers are made, not born. This is not a natural process. We are herd animals. We like people who are like us . . . Naturally, as a CEO, I set the tone for the company's management style. With my Anglo-Saxon education and Swedish upbringing, I have a certain way of doing things.

Language, a vital aspect of social identify of any group, is here clearly used for the purpose of self-identification.

, On a lexicosemantic level words and phrases relate to ideals, aspirations and principles of management; ambition, hunger, excel, champion, hungry wolves.   
, On a discourse level images possess a strong cultural flavour: We shook hands and were in business\*much to the chagrin of Stride Rite's lawyers (handshake, an indisputably ethical act vs the proverbial deviousness of lawyers); With my Anglo-Saxon education and Swedish upbringing, I have a certain way of doing things. (an appealing combination of public school pedigree and traditional upbringing).

The final message is plain: I am positive/trustworthy/ethical; I am hardworking/efficient/competitive . . .

# 2. Review of Relevant Literature

Capital globalization in the late eighties and nineties encouraged an upsurge of interest in various aspects of English in international business and management: the specifics of Business English (Pickett, 1989), the status of English as an international language in business setting (Firth, 1990), cross-cultural training and importance of individuals’ communicative styles (Inman, 1980, 1985), disparity between teaching materials and actual linguistic requirements (Williams, 1988), interaction between language and profession in European managerial education (Crane, 1990), treatment of language and linguistic issues in English-language management literature (Holden, 1987), the sociological aspects of language learning in Japanese corporations (Holden, 1990), foreign language use among American executives (Lambert, 1990), language, cultural values and leadership style (Punnett, 1991), rhetorical and organizational aspects of business negotiations (Charles, 1996).

The significance of communication in management has been recognized in literature on international business, management and marketing (Peters and Waterman, 1982; Drucker, 1980; DeBono, 1985; Peters and Austin, 1986; Evans and Russel, 1990; Cohen et al., 1988; Weihrich and Koontz, 1993: 4; Reichheld 1996 and many others). Language as a separate topic is, however, mentioned rarely: authors do not seem to be aware of the potential value of applied linguistics for management science (cf Holden, 1987: 233–246).

ESL/EFL textbooks were the first to show an awareness of the specific communication and linguistic needs of the managerial profession, combining business and commercial matters with managerial issues under the title of Business English. Textbooks specifically addressing the use of English in management represent a trend of the nineties; we view this as a first step towards the emancipation of ME from Business English (Fox, 1995).

Considerable uncertainty is felt about the identity of Business English, the status of English in management and the nature of the relationship between the two. According to St John (1996: 4), a ‘‘proliferation of terms within Business English’’ (English for Professionals, Executive English, English for Management), is a result of the wish to distinguish and sell (the product). It is a reflection of marketing efforts of private language schools and training organizations: ‘‘. . . companies spend thousands on developing the ‘right’ brand name; high quality products and names that resonate with value, thus business vs commerce, executive vs manager—after all, you have middle managers but chief executives!’’. Perhaps a further reason is the essential insecurity in choosing the ‘‘appropriate’’ name for an area which is, in terms of systematic sociolinguistic research, still largely a ‘‘terra incognita’’.

Fascination with the rhetorical power of words is responsible both for the emergence and eager public reception of many books centered around a word list. Books of this type vary radically in intention, scope and overall applicability: from simple, not too ambitious publications organized around what is known as business buzzwords1 or corporate graffiti (e.g. Johnson, 1990) to projects founded on some form of research (e.g. Shaw and Weber, 1990).

Investigations related to the English of international business and management are mainly focused on its use as lingua franca of international business negotiations and transactions. Little if any research has been directed at the social identity of managerial language, essential for public realization of the positive self-concept of the individual and the group.

# 3. Management Ergolect

Language of management is very special in two aspects. First, as management is a part of an organization engaged in a specific activity (in this paper subprofession), the language of management invariably coexists with at least one other occupational language (language of a subprofession), representing a communication and linguistic subsystem within a greater system. Second, the language of management is spoken by a social group powerful enough to create and maintain its social image and social position through verbal means.

Traditionally used terms for occupational languages—register, jargon, technical language—represent somewhat inappropriate labels for the language of management: register for its imprecision (Quirk, 1968; Hudson, 1991; Trudgill, 1988; Bhatia, 1993), jargon for negative connotations (Warner, 1962; Quirk, 1968; particularly Leech, 1981: 35) and technical language for the width of its scope.

We suggest the use of the term ergolect, first employed by Pickett (1989: 5). Ergolect connects two chief aspects of a professional language: subject matter and situation. As a relatively new term ergolect offers the potential to cover, as aptly put by Pickett, ‘‘whatever else we feel forms part of an occupational dialect’’.

In this paper, as in other related research (Fox, 1994, 1995, 1996), management ergolect (ME) is used as a generic term for English of international management. It covers all of its many aspects: linguistic, stylistic, rhetorical and social.

# 4. Compilation of the Text Corpus and Computational Text Analysis

Research based on a text corpus generally arises from two assumptions: that the corpus is representative, meaning that findings based on the corpus can be correlated to a larger hypothetical corpus, and that its size is adequate. Representativeness is, in fact, often regarded as being in direct proportion to size. On the other hand, only an application of a statistical model would make the corpus really representative, meaning that most existing corpora are assumed representative (cf Leech, 1991: 27).

The size of a text corpus primarily depends on the range of research. Whereas general purpose corpora are recommended to be as large as possible, investigations into technical and professional languages have demonstrated the representativeness of small domain-specific text corpora, totaling 20,000–30,000 running words (Yang, 1986: 93–103; Greenbaum, 1991: 87), a consequence of the restrictions of specialized languages (Wilkins, 1977: 73): predictable topics, limited syntactic structures of unusual distribution and specialized vocabulary.

For this research a 78,875 running word text corpus of written English was compiled from a number of publications in the field of international management: by random sampling from the book People in Organizations (Smith and Vigor, 1991), and the British magazine International Management (editions June 1992 through March 1993); by stratified sampling from international business and management publications Harvard Business Review, Personnel, Management International Review (MIR) and International Business Week. Text genres included are the interview, the scientific and professional paper, the report and the case study.

Computational analysis of the corpus was performed with the program TEXTPACK PC, Release 5.0 (Mohler and Zu¨ll, 1995). A frequency list, an alphabetical list and text concordances were obtained. Tokens (all words which form the text), types (different word forms), hapax (items appearing only once) and type-token ratio (TTE) were computed as standard features of the program (Table 1). The Hapax-type ratio (HTR) was computed manually.

A written corpus imposes limitations. International management is an area where a spoken corpus is not easily available (St John, 1996: 4–5). As a rule, companies are unwilling to allow recording of boardroom negotiations, shareholders’ meetings and company policy discussions. Public media (pro fessional journals and TV) offer material mainly in the form of interviews.

<html><body><table><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Tokens 78,875 Types 9238</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td>Hapax 4594 TTR</td></tr><tr><td>11.71</td></tr><tr><td>HTR 49.73</td></tr></table></body></html>

Future investigations into ME will, we hope, be based on a combined, spoken-written, corpus of monitor-type. A monitor corpus with constant input of material, ‘‘with its capacity to hold a ‘state of language’ for research purposes’’ (Sinclair, 1991: 26; Leech, 1991: 10), would be ideally suited for the investigation of the dynamic nature of ME.

# 5. Computational Analysis Results and Interpretation

TABLE 1 Corpus Basic Parameters   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Lexical Words</td><td>thematic (contextual) words key words words of business transaction words of subprofessions</td></tr></table></body></html>

The frequency list suggests a layer-like lexical structure, which has been more precisely identified through two types of criteria: structural and functional. Structural criteria were applied to separate lexical words from grammatical words. By means of functional criteria lexical words were subdivided into:

, Thematic (contextual) words , Key words , Words of business transactions , Words of subprofessions , Professionalisms (Fig. 1)

# GRAMMATICAL

# 5.1. Grammatical Words

Compared to some other text corpora,2 this corpus uses fewer grammatical words (words of low information content): the cumulative relative frequency of ten most frequent (inevitably grammatical) words in the corpus is $2 1 . 8 7 \%$ . The immediate consequences are greater lexical density (cf Ure, 1971) and a tendency towards so called abbreviated grammar, also typical of the language of commercial advertising (Leech, 1971: 94) and Press English.

# 5.2. Lexical Words

The relatively lower use of grammatical words in ME (5.1.) leads to a more intensive employment of lexical words. As carriers of the information, lexical words activate more extensive and diverse cognitive materials, and can elicit more pronounced emotions (cf Beaugrande and Dressler 1981: 142). The result is a comparatively greater exactness of information and greater precision in message formulation.

The highest ranks on the corpus frequency list are shared by two groups of lexical words: thematic words, items related to topic and activity, and key words,3 items related to principles and ideals of profession and a social group (Table 2).

Unlike thematic words, which are clearly relatable to language register (company, management, manager, business, market) and therefore constant, keywords are rather ephemeral in nature. There are variations in basic ideas, principles and values among cultures, societies, social groups and professions and, consequently, in their choice of key words.

TABLE 2 Ten Highest Ranked Lexical Words with Absolute (afr.) and Relative (rfr.) Frequencies   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Lexical words</td><td>Afr.</td><td>Rfr.</td></tr><tr><td>Company</td><td>390</td><td>0.494</td></tr><tr><td>Work</td><td>371</td><td>0470</td></tr><tr><td>Manager</td><td>285</td><td>0.361</td></tr><tr><td>Management</td><td>255</td><td>0.323</td></tr><tr><td>Organization</td><td>254</td><td>0.322</td></tr><tr><td>Market</td><td>235</td><td>0.298</td></tr><tr><td> People</td><td>231</td><td>0.293</td></tr><tr><td>Business</td><td>208</td><td>0.293</td></tr><tr><td>Group</td><td>204</td><td>0.264</td></tr><tr><td> Job</td><td>147</td><td>0.186</td></tr></table></body></html>

Representing labels for ideals and values of a civilization, society or a social group (Ullman, 1973: 73–74; 1983: 50), key words acquire the key status within a certain social context (e.g. impeachment at the time of the Watergate scandal). With the passing of time and changed circumstances they lose their relevance.

The key words in the corpus (Table 3) are concentrated in the high-tomedium ranks. Out of all lexical words in the rank range 28–150, $5 2 \%$ are thematic and $4 8 \%$ are key words. Below rank 150 (afr. 20), the number of key words drops sharply. Frequencies below afr. 20 are dominated by words of business transactions (Business English), words of subprofessions, company names and professionalisms.

Key words of international management are conceptually related to the fundamental principles of managerial profession and the ideals of management as a social group (cf Footnote 1):

work a bias for action   
organization division of work, order, simple form—lean stuff   
people productivity through people   
group subordination of individual interests to the general, esprit de co

Words such as work, group, people are simple, clear and possess a certain heart-warming quality, which makes them indispensable in public speaking. International management, by definition a public activity, is bound to rely on widely comprehensible, positively connotated items.

Professionalisms, inside terms of the managerial profession, have low individual frequencies. As a lexical layer they show a stable distribution and appear in all text samples regardless of genre. Centres of attraction are many: sports and games (champion, player, track record), war and fighting (dawn raid, headhunting, hip shooter), prestigious sciences—information science (binary thinker), medicine (drip-feeding), biotechnology (clone)— and the animal world (bear hug, killer bee). An individual concept attracting a great number of professionalisms is finance (negative cashflow, quick fix, telephone numbers).

# 5.3. Type-Token Ratio and Word Length

Type token ratio (TTR), the percentage of types in the text, is a reliable indicator of lexical diversity. The value of TTR is not linear: it decreases with text size. In comparison of texts significantly different in size, TTR will appear to be much higher in the short texts than in the long ones. In Biber’s computations (1991: 247–269) mean TTR values in a number of 400 word text samples ranged from 44.9 to 56.5.

Compared to Business English Corpus, a text corpus of similar size (cf footnote 2), this corpus possesses a noticeably higher TTR: 11.71. Another reliable measure of lexical diversity, often co-occurring with TTR, is word length (Biber, 1991: 104–105). The average word length in the corpus in orthographic letters is 5.39. By comparison, a 5000 word text sample taken from Ullmann’s Semantics (1983) gives an average word length of 4.81.

A comparably higher TTR and greater word length of TC suggest a more extensive use of words with specific meanings, in other words, greater information concentration (density) and exactness.

# 5.4. Hapax-Type Ratio

The probability that a certain type has one occurrence in a text can be estimated by the relation between hapax and types. Providing the compared texts are approximately equal in length the hapax-type ratio (HTR) increases with a more varied vocabulary and indicates the rhythm by which the vocabulary is augmented (cf Muller, 1969: 42–56). Compared to Business English Corpus and Mechanical Engineering Corpus (Footnote 2), the HTR value in this corpus is noticeably higher: 49.73. In correlation with the corpus’ higher TTR and word length, a higher HTR indicates a more exact lexical choice and, consequently, higher information density.

# 6. Dominant Concepts

Each language is related to reality in a specific way. Numerous investigations have shown that language affects perception and memory. People find it easier to make conceptual distinctions if the physical reality corresponds with words and phrases available in the language (Crystal, 1991).

When confronted with a particular expression, language users tend to activate approximately the same cognitive content. This configuration of knowledge is a concept (Beaugrande and Dressler, 1981: 85). The connection between words and concepts may be conventional, but the existence of the concepts is not. All languages contain words to mark concepts and conceptual categories formed through direct observation (Lyons, 1978: 110).

In his research into property concepts (concepts referring to properties, qualities or characteristics of referents) of seventeen languages, Dixon (1977) suggests that each lexical item in the language belongs to a semantic type, which is related to a linguistic category. English, for example, is marked by a close correspondence between property concepts and the linguistic category of adjective (cf Thompson, 1990). Dixon defines the universal adjective type by analyzing the functions of adjectives in English. Based on morphological, semantic and syntactic criteria, he suggests the following types of property concepts: dimension, physical property, colour, human propensity, age, value and speed.

Using Dixon’s typology we classified all adjectives in the corpus down to absolute frequency 20. What emerges are the dominant conceptual areas of ME: time, human propensity and value.

# 6.1. Time

A total of 1238 time references makes time the most frequent single property concept in the corpus. The results of quantitative analysis indicate the greater significance of a long-time perspective in international management: 36 instances of long in temporal use (over the long term) vs 14 instances of short in temporal use (short-term market interest). This is an expected consequence of the corpus being focused on top management, which is mainly engaged in formulating strategies and setting objectives.

A number of temporal references in TC are related to speed (global speed, work-cycle is short and repetitive, fast-growing advanced technology . . .). Under the constant pressure of activities the only choice the manager seems to have is to work either less or faster.

# 6.2. Human Propensity

The property concept type human propensity reflects the concern of management for people. Through the function of leading, managers help people satisfy a variety of primarily social and professional, needs and at the same time use their potential to contribute to the enterprise.

Dominant concepts in this category (Table 4)—competitive (competitive market/advantage/realities), motivating (motivating factors/force/ direction), responsible (responsible for planning/organizing/formulation of policy), individual (individual goals/initiative/performance) and efficient (efficient communication, market efficiency, efficiency in production)— represent a perfect verbal frame for outlining the aims and functions of management.

The use of the property concept free (free of state influence, free enterprise, freerain management) originates in the culture of society: freedom is a fundamental value of Western culture (Hojrup, 1983; Mowen, 1987). This global cultural pattern is inevitably reproduced in the culture of organization and reflected through language.

TABLE 4 Human Propensity   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Property concept</td><td>Afr.</td></tr><tr><td>Competitive</td><td>96</td></tr><tr><td>Motivating</td><td>86</td></tr><tr><td>Responsible</td><td>65</td></tr><tr><td> Individual</td><td>58</td></tr><tr><td>Social</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Human</td><td>57</td></tr><tr><td>Informal</td><td>43</td></tr><tr><td>Free</td><td>34 30</td></tr><tr><td>Efficient</td><td>28</td></tr></table></body></html>

The property concept informal (informal communication/fringe benefits/groups) is essential for management: a great deal of influence in an enterprise is of an informal-legitimate nature (not assigned but accepted as proper), based upon knowledge and expertise (French and Raven, 1960; Cohen et al., 1988: 309–315).

# 6.3. Value

Whereas the clearly positive value property concepts—good (good leadership/person/administration), successful (successful managers/ corporations/business), important (important leaders/objectives/people), right (right kind of alliance, right balance, right Euroexeutive)—occupy the highest ranks (Table 5), their counterparts are either in the lower frequency group or absent (afr. 0); bad (afr. 31) wrong (afr. 13), unimportant/not important (afr. 0), unsuccessful/not successful (afr. 0).

Value property concepts are selectively associated with thematic and key words, as shown in the example of property concept good:

TABLE 5 Value   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Property Concept</td><td>Afr.</td></tr><tr><td>Good (+well)</td><td>137 (+41)</td></tr><tr><td>Successful</td><td>78</td></tr><tr><td>Important</td><td>70</td></tr><tr><td>Right</td><td>29</td></tr></table></body></html>

good (afr. 67)

better (afr. 35)

good leadership (afr. 22)   
good management (afr. 16)   
good business (afr. 8)   
good person/people (afr. 8)   
good administration, customer service, stockoption package etc. (total afr. 13)   
better pay and conditions (afr. 6)   
better organization (afr. 4)   
better job (afr. 5)   
better executive (afr. 4)   
better approaches, chances, choices etc. (total afr. 16)   
best executive (afr. 11)   
best business (afr. 7)   
best interest of the organization (afr. 5)   
the best out of people (afr. 2)   
best chances, practice, people, antidote etc. (total afr. 10)

best (afr. 35)

In a total of 67 occurrences, good is used 22 times to qualify leadership, and 16 times to qualify management. Similarly, out of a total of 35, best collocates 11 times with executives. Such preference of choice once again confirms positive public self-identification as one of the main functions of ME.

# 6.4. Spatiality

Spatiality, a property concept area not included in Dixon’s typology, is dominant in ME (Table 6).

It is worth pointing out that the highest-ranked single concepts in this area are European (European profitability/culture/marketing, Euroexecutive, Euromanager), Japanese (Japanese job market, Japanese dragon) and German (German) origin/engineers/quality.

TABLE 6 Spatiality   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Property concept</td><td>Afr.</td></tr><tr><td>European</td><td>196</td></tr><tr><td> Japanese</td><td>145</td></tr><tr><td>German</td><td>68</td></tr><tr><td>American</td><td>66</td></tr><tr><td>International</td><td>62</td></tr><tr><td>Foreign</td><td> 50</td></tr><tr><td>Global</td><td>39</td></tr></table></body></html>

# 7. Sociorhetorical Function of Dominant Concepts

The dominant conceptual areas of ME—time, human propensity and value—clearly reflect the professional and social priorities of management. In the choice of individual dominant concepts ME demonstrates a general preference for the distinctly positive concepts: good, successful, large, new, strong (absolute frequency range 150–35) over negative: bad (afr. 31), unsuccessful/not successful (afr. 0), old (afr. 33), weak (afr. 11).

The selection and use of ME dominant concepts are consistent with the society and group culture. It is the common sociocultural knowledge (cf Halliday, 1978) of both speaker and audience that enables their optimal selection and adequate interpretation.

# 8. Profit and Productivity

‘‘The aim of all managers is . . . to create a surplus’’ (Weihrich and Koontz, 1993: 4). Their main concern is productivity. One would expect words related to the principal aims and concerns of management (surplus, profit, productivity) to be highly ranked, to perform as key words. This, however, is not so. Compared to the key words work, group, people, (Table 3) and dominant concepts competitive, motivating, good (6.2.), profit (afr. 34), words such as surplus (afr. 0) and productivity (afr. 15) are modestly used.

If the concept is taken for granted, the need for its verbal realization can be reduced or even eliminated (Ure, 1971: 443–452). Are the said concepts omitted because they are just taken for granted or is this a case of pre meditated avoidance of verbal realization?

Our analysis points towards the latter: to be more precise, towards a sociorhetorical usefulness of a concept as a key criterion for its realization/omission. The social value of concepts such as work, people, group is universal; they are usable and useful in any context. Concepts such as profit and productivity, the indicators of managerial success, can be controversial and their use dangerous. Consequently, generally useful concepts are freely realized, and, what is more, used frequently. The possibly controversial concepts are subject to, what we have named, communicational control strategies: the strategy of omission (relying on situational context to enable implicit understanding) and/or strategy of replacement (substituting the critical concept by a euphemism). The concentration of professionalism around selected areas (5.2.) is a manifestation of the replacement strategy. Both strategies ultimately result in a decrease of absolute frequencies of selected items.

# 9. Metaphor Use . . .

A metaphor count of a 30,000 running word text subcorpus taken from the corpus revealed a total of 655 metaphors, slightly more than one metaphor for every three sentences (average sentence length 16.6 words).

But . . . Gault is one of the nation's leading business statesmen with a deep reservoir of credibility with the financial community.   
In tackling the personal problems, he began by shedding fat at the top.   
We like victory, but what we like even more is holding the opposition scoreless. We're absolutely determined to win, but it's winning absolutely that we love. You have to be on the front lines with your troops, in constant contact with your customer.   
He got on the fast-track line and stayed there.   
Each project was led by a champion–some from top management ranks, some from the other \`\`hungry wolves''.   
We operate as lean as humanly possible. The closer we get to top management, the tougher we have to be with head count.

ME metaphors, as can be seen, tend to cluster around contents such as war, combat, sports, games and specific animal imagery (predators), cre ating an image of a self-assured, strong, aggressive and winning person.

Professionalism, mainly metaphorical in nature, shows similar thematic preferences:

track record consistent top performance of a manager   
dawn raid a financial move by a predator company at the opening bell of stockmarket trading.   
bear hug dominance of a stronger business partner   
hit squad the acquisition team.

Clearly, manager’s choice of metaphors is not random. Metaphors build a network consistent with the social context: management is competition. In line with his or her professional, social and personal objectives, as well as his or her cultural affiliations, the manager selectively highlights particular segments of reality.

In metaphor selection and generation process the manager, as our research suggests, relies on three elements of common cultural knowledge shared with his or her audience: metaphor identification, interpretation strategy awareness and metaphor acceptance.

, Metaphor identification: recognizing the existence of metaphor. It includes familiarity with its basically, simple structure: tenor (the subject of the metaphor) is related to the vehicle (the thing to which the subject is compared) on the basis of ground (the common element).   
1. We operate as lean as humanly possible. The closer we get to top management, the tougher we have to be with head count.   
2. You have to be on the front lines with your troops, in constant contact with your customer.   
3. Most targeted companies, whether Japanese or foreign, see no choice but to cross licence, giving the predator the right to practice the misappropriated invention.

Interpretation strategy awareness: related to the speaker’s expectations of metaphor interpretation strategy and the recipient's "correct" interpretation.

1. ...as lean as humanly possible ... the tougher we have to be with head count. Tenor: recruitment of managers Vehicles: lean, head count.   
2. . . .on the frontlines . Tenor: manager’s competitiveness Vehicle: front lines . . . with your troops . . Tenor: manager’s team   
3. . . .giving the predator the right . . Tenor: company that misappropriated the licence Vehicle: predator

Depending on the nature of the vehicle, tenor is, on the ground of either objective or emotive similarity, interpreted as powerful/weak, competitive/uncompetitive, ethical/unethical.

, Metaphor acceptance: a confirmation of the reality of the metaphor. If the audience sees the reality as defined by the metaphor, then the metaphor is ‘‘true’’ (cf Lakoff and Johnson, 1980: 156–158). In other words, the metaphor creates new reality.

The ‘‘truths’’ offered in the three metaphors above are:

1. Company X is more demanding/selective than other companies.   
2. Management is war.   
3. It is unethical to misappropriate an invention.

The contribution of metaphor to the process of public self-identification of manager and management is realized on two levels: metaphor enables an instant and appropriate identification of the individuals/groups and processes within a single discourse; it also represents a significant contribution to asserting manager’s ideological position in general.

# 10. . . . and Metaphor Avoidance

A decisive element of corporate image, key to better employee morale and customer goodwill, ethics seems to be fully excluded from ME metaphor generation. When referring to issues of ethics, ME is very explicit:

The 46-year-old man, no-nonsense Dammerman, who grew up on a farm in Iowa . . . He believes that benchmarks on quality, customer relations and speed to market are as important as any accounting statistics. Like good traditional bankers, we believed in the sanctity of the small savings account.

Publicly declaring the ethicality of one’s behaviour and one’s company, a task for a top-level manager, seems to be an issue far too important to be left to the chance of correct interpretation. Executives rather go for the explicit. Images such as farm in Iowa and sanctity of the savings account are literally screaming with sincerity and their social value is self-evident.

Explicitness in the issues of ethics (in the otherwise highly metaphorical ME) appears to be a process analogical to the avoidance of controversial key concepts (8.0): after all, either can be crucial for the evaluation of a manager’s professional performance and, ultimately, his social status.

# 11. Conclusion

Findings confirm that the management ergolect is a much wider entity than just a language of business transactions and negotiations. The driving force behind ME is managers’ need for public realization of a positive selfconcept.

More than a mere professional, today’s international manager possesses considerable social power. He is a celebrity, a star, a legend. His social image is duly registered in ME through the use of key words, dominant concepts and metaphors.

Key words and dominant concepts reflect the professional and social priorities of international management. Coherent with societal and group culture, they carry selected sociocultural values and function as social symbols.

As practical short formulae, metaphors offer instant images and create a new reality. ME metaphor generation enables public identification of manager and management on two levels: within each single discourse and on the global level, asserting the ideology of management as the only one which is appropriate.

The use and reception of key words, dominant concepts and metaphors rely on the common social knowledge of participants in the process of communication which enables a quick and unmistakable positive self-identification of the speaker and, if necessary, negative identification of the opponent.

The sociorhetorical function of ME is realized both in the contents selected for verbal realization (key words, dominant concepts, metaphors) and in the contents avoided (controversial concepts, ethical issues in metaphor generation network).

A management ergolect is at the same time a powerful tool of public selfidentification and a product of and a factor in social reality. In other words, the manager’s social position generates an ergolect which, in turn, enforces the manager’s social power.
