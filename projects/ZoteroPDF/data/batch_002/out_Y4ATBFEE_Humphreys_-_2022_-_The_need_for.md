The literature focusing on the linguistic development of students with English as an additional language (EAL) in higher education has tended to focus on settings where English is not the first language of the majority of the population. This has led to the implicit assumption that English language outcomes in English-taught programs in anglophone higher education institutions (HEIs) are unproblematic. Yet the linguistic outcomes of EAL students in Australian HEIs have come under considerable scrutiny in recent years, and the available research provides evidence that improvement is not guaranteed over the course of a university degree.

The national focus on international EAL students and the volume of research on the topic makes Australia a useful case study, specifically for anglophone nations with similar international student profiles. Using Australia as a case study, this article outlines the issue to evidence that this is still not being adequately addressed. It describes the national sets of principles and standards and the research evidence around EAL graduates' English language outcomes. It makes the case that it is necessary to measure and evaluate English language outcomes and to ensure that English language proficiency is explicitly developed as part of a university's core business, even in traditional anglophone nations. Recommendations to assist universities to develop and evaluate English language outcomes are provided, along with a call to action for HEIs to evaluate and assure context-specific graduating English language outcomes.

# 1. Introduction

The burgeoning literature focusing on the linguistic development and outcomes of students with English as an additional language (EAL) in higher education has tended to focus on setings where English is not the firs language (L1) of the majority of the population, i.e. English medium of intruction (EM1) (Bowles & Murphy, 2020; British Council, 2021; Dafouz & Smit, 2020; Dearden, 2014; Doiz et al., 2013; Fenton-Smith et al., 2017; Macaro, 2018; Macaro et al., 2019; Wachter & Maiworm, 2008). There has been an implict assumption that the English language outcomes of EAL students studying in traditional English-speaking contexts is unproblematic, premised on the fact that there are considerable language immersion opportunities on- and off-campus in anglophone setings, in addition to English being the medium of instruction. However, the linguistic outcomes of students with English as an Additional Language (EAL) in Australia have come under scrutiny in recent years, and the available research provides evidence that English language improvement is not guaranteed even over the course of an entire university degree.

The national focus on international EAL students, including the publication of a set of English Language Standards for Higher Edu. cation and the volume of research on the topic, makes Australia a useful case study, specificll for anglophone nations who largely have similar intnational stdent profile. Using Australiaas a casestudy, ths article outines the isue, and descries the ntionl sets of principles and standards and the research evidence around EAL graduates' English language outcomes to challenge the view that language development is unproblematic in anglophone setings. It argues the case for more concerted action on English language development during university studies taught in English, including in anglophone nations, to ensure the successful outcomes of all students, and to deliver on the hoped-for employment and career outcomes at home or abroad.

# 2. International EAL students in anglophone contexts

Over the last two decades, higher education institutions (HEIs) in anglophone nations have attracted large numbers of overseas students and, collectively, the ie main nglish-speaking countries have accounted for almost half of them (Read, 2015). In the UK, for example, half a million international students were undertaking higher education studies in 2018/19, representing almost $2 0 \%$ of the student population (Universities UK, 2021), including a $7 5 \%$ increase in Chinese enrolments since the mid-90s (Onward Research, 2020). In 2009, the UK Quality Assurance Agency (QAA), published a report which raised concerns about academic quality and standards in which the language level of EAL students was a key theme (Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA), 2009. It recommended that institutions review English language proficiency (ELP) entry standards and provide a statement on the support available to students. I is unclear whether o to what extent these recommendations were actioned, though the literature suggests that greater synergy is required between discipline and language experts to make language more visible in universities (Bond, 2020.

Canada's international student population hail from similar source countrie to the UK, witha similarly high reliance on China and India. Enrolments of international students tripled from 2009 to 2019, representing $1 6 \%$ of total enrolments, and ranking third globall after the US and Australia by 2020 (CBIE, 2021; IC News, 2020), though it has become an even more popular destination since coviD-19, welcoming an all-time record. Extensive work has been undertaken on the development of national language benchmarks amed at second language adul itracy in Canada (Centre for Curle, Jablonkai, Mittelmeier, Sahan, & Veitch, 2020), yet there is no evidence of a policy or standards framework related to international EAL students in higher education.

Similar to Canada, pre-coviD enrolments in New Zealand showed that international students also made up $1 6 \%$ of university enrolments (Universities New Zealand, 2018) and, while the scholarly literatre reports similar isues to the UK, there is no reference to EAL students' language outcomes in policy (Beaver & Tuck, 199; Read, 2015; Read & von Randow, 2013).

In absolute numbers, the USA has long been the dominant destination for overseas students. An estimated one million international students were enrolled in US HEIs in 2019-20, more than half from China and India (Open Doors, 2021). Although international enrolments only represent $6 \%$ of higher education enrolments, the number in absolute terms is considerable. The US has a long history of supporting the ELP of EAL immigrant chldren (Cummins, 200), though no set of standards or policy exists in higher education. It is possible that ssues related to this cohort may be unnoticed due to the pro rata effect of EAL students.

Like its anglophone counterparts, Australia has seen phenomenal growth in its international enrolments in the last two decades (Humphreys, 2017; Marginson, 2002). The top ten source markets in 2021 were (in order of size) China, India, Nepal, Vietnam, Colombia, Malaysia, Brazil Indonesia, Pakistan and Hong Kong. As early as 2011, the average percentage of intenational enrolments in Australian universities was over $2 0 \%$ , with some as high as $4 5 \%$ (Chaney, 2013). From time to time, concerns have been raised over Australia's exposure due to its reliance on China specifically (Babones, 2019), which already accounted for over $5 0 \%$ of all international students pre-CoviD. Post-CoviD, Chinese enrolments have bucked the general decline in international numbers, accounting for over $5 0 \%$ of international students in New South Wales. In 2022, seven of the state's ten public universities recorded China as its lead source of overseas revenue, with one high-ranked university relying on Chinese for $8 7 \%$ of its international income, posing a "concentration risk" (White, 2022). There have also been negative public perceptions of EAL graduates' language outcomes and their work-readiness raised by the media, including allegations of compromised entry standards, soft marking by academics to accommodate poor language skill, and poor linguistic outcomes at graduation (ABC 2015, 2019; Trounson, 2011; Worthington et al, 2019).

In all of the above anglophone nations, enrolments have been dominated by students from China and India, and from the top ten source markets lrgely from Asia and Latin America (DESE, 2021). Space recludes discussion of the contentious notion of the native speaker/learner/user' (Canagarajah, 2007; Widdowson, 1994). However, these students include large numbers of what were tradi tionally described as English as a Foreign Language (EFL) from outer circle countrie such as China or Brazil (Kachru, 1982), as well as contexts where English is used as a Second Language (EsL) in aspects of everyday life as a shared ingua franca such as India and other expanding circle settings (Jenkins, 2014; Kirkatrick, 2017). Given the source countries, itis clear that the majority use English as an additional language (EAL). Itis acknowledged that students categorized as domestic (or home' students) may also be EAL, that there is also no such thing as a 'native writer, and that all students require support to develop language and literacies apropriate for academic purposes in higher education (Holmen, 2020). ELP challenges are therefore unlikely to be confined to the international EAL cohort, though the latter are the focus of this article.

The expectation is that students travelling overseas to study in an anglophone HEI willbe immersed in an English-speaking environment and have plentiful opportunity to improve their English language proficiency (ELP) both on- and off-campus. As the numbers erlier in this ction indicate, the reality of thi lived experience can be different from the expecttion, and this may impede ELP development (Gribble, 2015). The net efect of what has been described hereis that the experience of studying at an anglophone university may diffe itl from an EMI experience in one's home country. As Pecorari (2018) notes: "It is thus osible that a student from mainland China studying engineering in Texas does not have significantly greater exposure to English than she would if she were studying in Beijing, and possibly less than if she were studying in Sweden" (p.503).

From thistandpoint, this article argues that the outcomes of EAL graduates need to be considered, and it i to the available evidence of these outcomes that we now turn.

# 3. The research evidence: ELP at graduation

Much of the scrutiny on the ELP of international students in the Australian context stems from the findings of Birrll, Hawthorne and Richardson (2006). This government-commissioned report found that at least a third of the Australian universty graduates applying for Graduate Skilled Migration had provided English language test cores in their visa application that were lower than were required to commence most Australian university degrees. Many had submitted score f IELs 5. or 5.5 for their visa even though the typical entry requirement to commence their degree would have been IELTs 6.0 or 6.5. This raised a range of questions related to possile compromises in enforcing entry standards, but it also brought into question the previously held assumption that the completion of a university degree automaticall correlated to a high level of English proficiency by graduation. This was the first available longitudinal research to suggest otherwise, and it was a powerful catalyst for change. A suite of government reports in subsequent years (Bradley, Noonan, Nugent, and Scales (2008); Baird (2010); Knight (2011); Chaney (2013) al highlighted the importance of ELP for graduate employability, and each recommended the need for improved language outcomes and for the eval. uation of it.

One mechanism for evidencing ELP improvement during university studies is t test t at graduation. Not everyone agrees that exit testing is appropriate or the only option, as summarized by Humphreys and Gribble (2013), with concerns chiefly related to validity. Standardised tes arguably raise issues of construct validit (the overarching appropriatenessfor measuring its defined theoretical purpose or construct), content validity (fi for purpose content), and criterion validity (the acurate prediction of a measured outcome) (Bachman & Palmer, 2010; Kane, 2013; Messck, 1996). Isues of onsequential validit have been raised as a particular isue i.e., the consequences of using a test for purposes that it was not originally designed for (Arkoudis & Doughney, 2014; McNamara & Roever, 2006; 0Loughlin, 2008), or as a policy to0 (Shohamy, 2007). It has also been argued that a generalised test may not provide test-takers with opportunities to display the discipline-specific language acquired during ther studie rtap into the domains that they have learnt (Knoch et al., 2015) and, for this reason, some have argued that we should asss language within disciplinary learning (Arkoudis, 2014). Other studies have concluded, however, that general proficiency tests of ELP can be useul as one source of evidence of work-eadiness (Merrfield, 011; Moore, Morto, Hall,  Walis, 2015; Wette, 2011). An altenative t such gnera intrments is a Language for Specific Purposes (LSP) test; however, few quality, discipline-specific/ocupation-specific instruments exist, with some notable excetions such as the Occupational English Test which is used for the medical professions (Occupational English Test (OET) 2021). Generally, LSP tests have also been said to yield problems of specificity, comparabilit, and practicality (Bachman & Palmer, 2010; Douglas, 200; Ingham & Thighe, 2006) and overall have not gained much traction. This highlights the fundamental challenge of identifying what we want to measure (proficiency? achievement? general academic language? within a specific field?) and how it might best be achieved.

Despite these challenges, as the demand for the assurance of graduates' ELP increased, large-scale English language proficiency tests emerged as instruments of choice. Several Australian universities implemented exit testing using IELTS Academic soon after the Birrll Report was published. Grffith Universt conducted atrial in 2007 (Humphreys & Mousavi, 2010, and institution-wide voluntary subsidised exit testing was implemented in 2008 as one component of the broader English Language Enhancement Strategy (English4grads, n.d.) using IELTS Academic and (later) the Pearson Test of English (PTE) Academic (Humphreys, 2016). The Universty of Queensland implemented the Graduate Exit IELTS Test in 2008 (University of Queensland, 2012), stating that graduates should be aiming for IELr 7.5 (Martin, 2011), though it was not articulated how this level was set or whether there was evidence that graduates were ataining it. In 2012, the University of New England followed suit, though information on this initiative is no longer publicly available and it may have been discontinued.

In the Griffith University study (Humphreys, 2016), 564 international undergraduate EAL students were tested at graduation using IELTS Academic at a single ite over a five-year period. Students were taking the subsidised test by choice for authentic purposes such as migration or professional registration, and the study was therefore high in ecological validity. Humphreys found that the most common overall IELTs band score at graduation was 6.5, though scores ranged widely. At the macro-skill level, the highest average scores were for Listening $( M = 6 . 8 5$ and the lowest for Writing $( M = 6 . 1 $ ). Not all students had used the IELTS test to enter the University but, where pre/post shift using the same instrument could be measured, a statisticallysignificant increase was observed from entry $M = 6 . 5 2$ $\mathbf { S D } = 0 . 5 5$ ) to exit ( $\mathbf { \mathit { M } } = 6 . 9 1$ $\mathrm { S D } = 0 . 7 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ $t ( 8 6 ) = 6 . 3 4$ $p < . 0 0 0$ (two-tailed). The mean increase was just 0.38 of a band score, and the most common increase was from ELs 6.0 to6.5. This study also used linear regression to investigate patterns by fi idfid ile, t fod stisticll siicn differ ba  gder dcin, y y, r ronfr takng the exit test. First language was the only variable to evidence statistically ignificant variability. Further analysis found that students with language backgrounds typologicall distant from English (Chan & Sylva, 2014; Gu, 2013; Skehan, 2008), including all Chinese languages/dialects, Korean and Vietnamese, typically obtained lower scores than speakers of Indo-European, Austronesian, or African languages.

The study also compared graduating language proficiency to academic outcomes as measured by Grade Point Average (GPA). A moderate correlation was found between IELTS Overall scores and GPA $( r = 0 . 3 8 )$ , with the strongest correlation found between GPA and the recetive skill (listening and reading),consistent with other research (Craven, 2012; Davies, 2008; O'Loughlin & Arkoudis, 2009). It was found to be highly unlikely that a student would do well academically with poor linguistic outcomes, and that language is a key enabler (though not a guarantee) of academic success. This is consistent with other indings (Criper & Davies, 1988; Edwards et a., 2021; Marginson, Nyland, Sawir, Forbes-Mewet, 2010; Phakit e al., 2013; Sawir et al., 2012; Ushioda & Harsch, 2011; eh & Inose, 2003).

The implications are that a minimum language entry level needs to be set (and adhered to) in order to improve a student's chances of academic success, especill since limited improvement occurs during higher education studies. It also suggests that those from language backgrounds with the greatest distance from English are likely to benefit most from in-degree academic language support interventions. Humphreys cautions about stereotyping whole cohorts of students based on this finding because other factors were also found to be at play, including motivation, agency and a range of individual difference. However, first language can be taken as a legitimate explanation of increased potential challenge for the improvement of ELP during degree studies.

Related research in the Australian context also found limited improvements in ELP during degrees (Benzie, 2010; Oliver et al. 2012). The O'Loughlin and Arkoudis study (2009) traced English proficiency of EAL students at Melbourne Universty over the course of a degr using offical  test cores, finding considerale variability in scores, with some participants scoring below the requisite level to enter their degree program at graduation. Craven's (2012) study at University of Technology, Sydney, also identified considerable variability, with the greatest gains in Listening and Reading and non-significant gains in Writing or Speaking. Craven found that some students made no progress between pre- and post-testing, and she highlighted the challenge of reaching IELTs 7.0, described as \*good user'. A further study in the Australian context used the Diagnostic English Language Assessment (DELA), a validated tes f reading, listening and writing sills developed by language test experts at the Universty of Melbourne, to investigate change in the writing skillover a three-year undergraduate degree (Knoch et al., 2015). The researchers found that overall scores for writing fll short of significance, and they attributed this to the limited extensive writing opportunties availale during underraduate degree programs as well as limited feedback on linguistic featres. All of these studies note limited improvement over the course of a degre, and the criticality of student aency for improvement tocur. These studies wre ased on small cohorts, and further evidence is desirable, but there is adequate evidence to warrant concern.

There is also a plethora of research indicating that English language competence is closely linked to the successful transition of Australian international graduates into the local labour market (Arkoudis et al., 2009; Gribble, 2014; 2015; Hawthorne & To, 2014; Humphreys & Grible, 2013). Poor employability outcomes for EAL graduates continue to be reported, and expert demographers have found that no other single factor has more statistical significance than language ability in determining early employment outcomes (Hawthorne, 2010; Hawthorne & To, 2014), notwithstanding the linguistic and/or cultural biases of local employers towards inter. national students.

In sum, the literature provides empirical evidence of ess-than-optimal ELP outcomes of EAL graduates in Australian universities, despite al the potential inherent advantages of studying in an anglophone context. Improvement of ELP during degrees in Australia annot therefre beassumed, especially in the writing skill Sinc ther angophone nations have similar international stdent pofiles, this may be also the case in other contexts.

# 4. English language principles and standards in Australia

As a result of mounting concern resulting from the Birell Report, a national symposium on the English language competence of international students was convened in 2007. For the first time, the focus had shfted from entry levels alone to the whole student journey from entry, experience and exit (Arkoudis et al, 2012; Arkoudis & Starfield, 2007; Hawthorne, 2007; O'Loughlin & Murray, 2007). This event was a catalyst for the development of a set of Good Practice Principles for English anguage Proficiency of Intenationl Students in Australin Universitie, which outlined the need to tackle the issue of ELP from enroment to graduation at an institutional level (Department of Education Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR), 2009) (Fig. 1).

The principles were certainly not a panacea, however: they were neither auditable standards, nor encompassed all institutions or students. In 2012, the English Language Standards for Higher Education were published (AUQA, 2012), which converted six of the ten

![](img/336cd99875005bdade191c96dfef8c66a4b6b27302ce28151888c37dd44f53c8.jpg)  
Fig. 1. The good practice principle for international students in Australian Universities (Department of Education Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR), 2009).

Good Practice Principle into a set of standards (seeFig. 2). They underlined the importance of language at all stages of the student lifecycle, referred to all higher education providers and to all students, not just EAL internationals. The wording had also gained strength, requiring HEIs to actively develop, ensure ELP and use evidence.

Although English language is referenced in the Higher Education Standards Framework (TEQSA, 2021a,b) and the regulator provides helpful guidance to providers to ensure compliance with legislative instruments, the above principles were not adopted by the national tertiary regulators and are therefore till not fully auditable a decade on, which would likely have put some pressure on providers. Instead, it was left to individual institutions to opt to met the Standards in policy or practice. Despite the considerable discussion, publications and govenment reports over afifeen-year period, AL intenational students in Austrliacan stil graduate without their ELP being explicitly evaluated (Arkoudis & Doughney, 2014).

While the existence of a policy may not translate to action, it can be a driver for change by making HEIs accountable. A desk audit of publicly available documents was undertaken in 2022 to identify institutional policies on English language in Australian universities. While it is possible that policies exist within staffacing policy sections of websites, only five (out of 41 HEIs) could be readily identified in the public domain, and none from universities regularly ranked in the top ten. The Universt of Technology Sydney is an example of an explicit policy, which is complemented by a comprehensive strategy to develop English language (https://gsu.uts.du. au/policies/english-language.html) (Edwards et al, 2021). Macquarie University developed a language statement, and a policy is awaiting approval. The Statement refers to the English Language Standards for Higher Education and makes it explicit that improving English language is everyone's business differentiated by role and expertise, and that there are expectations of improved language proficiency by graduation (Macquarie University, 2019). Communication with Academic Language and Learning (ALL) colleagues nationally appears to confirm the finding that few English language policies exist. One colleague reported the development of a language policy at a highly ranked Australian university in the early 2o00s, driven by the Linguistics Department and considered comprehensive in terms of philosophy and the intiatives to operationalise t. However, it was not approved by the University Council, allegedly due to the perceived potential negative impact on internatioal student recruitment (Moore, 2020), suggesting that language ideologies in HEIs can be seriously impacted by the tension inherent in the notion of student-as-customer. In 2021, a useful guide to English language policy making in higher education was published to support Australian HEIs in this regard (Knoch, 2021), though its impact on policy making is as yet unknown.

It is obvious from the literature in the field, however, that the Principles and Standards were powerful incentives for change in practice. Between 208 and 2011, for example, there was an exponential increase in support for EAL students across Austrlian HEIs (Barthel, 2011). The Degrees of Proficiency project evidenced the increased national uptake, summarizing examples f best practice and resource ina single website (Dunworth et al., 2013). Some HEIs had developed frameworks explicating incremental goals over the course of the degee to scaffold and evaluate delopment of ELP and academic literacie (Chalmer et al., 2010; arper, 2011). Others had implemented sustainable whole-of-institution approaches (Arkoudis, 2014; Dunworth et al., 2014; Edwards et al., 2021; Fen ton-Smith et al., 2015; Harper, 2013. Griffith University implemented a whole-of-universty strategy providing a range of ELP enhancement mechanisms from entry to exit, including compulsory credit-bearing units, voluntary student-directed workshops and individual consultations, discipline-specific seminars for postgraduates, social out-of-class support, and voluntary exit testing, for example (Griffth Universiy, n.d.). The Universiy of Technology Sydney i another example (Edwards et al., 2021). These Principles, Standards and examples of best practice and policies could be usefully adopted and adapted in other contexts.

# 5. Recommendations to develop and evaluate graduating language outcomes

The research evidence of language outcomes suggests that consideration is warranted to assure strong language outcomes of EAL students at graduation whether in anglophone or more traditional EMI setings. What is clear is that ELP should be viewed as the core business of any university where courses are delivered in English and as a key outcome for EAL graduates. The following ists six recommendations for HEIs drawing from the literature and the case study described above:

1. Use the English Language Standards in Higher Education as a point of departure to focus on the critical stages of entry, experience and exit.

1. The provider ensures that its students are sufficiently proficient in English to participate effectively in their higher education studies on entry.   
2. The provider ensures that prospective and current students are informed about their responsibilitie for further developing their English language proficiency during their higher education studies.   
3. The provider ensures that resourcing for English language development meets students' needs throughout their studies.   
4. The provider actively develops students English language proficiency during their studies..   
5. The provider ensures that students are appropriately proficient in English when they graduate.   
6. The provider uses evidence from a variety of sources to monitor and improve it support for the development of students' English language proficiency.   
2. Undertake regular institutional research to systematically evaluate and assure EAL students' graduating English language outcomes.   
3. Develop an explicit policy, framework and/or statement that i staff- and student-facing, which makes reference to English language development and outcomes.   
4. Provide targted support for the students identified as being most at ris, informed by the reearch literature as well a institutional data.   
5. Develop the weakest language skills, based on the literature and institutional research data (e.g. writing).   
6. Communicate to stakeholders about typical language acquisition rates, the value of English language for students aademic succes and future employability, and institutional decisions and responsibilities ensuing from recommendations 1-5.

# 6. Conclusion

This article used Australias a case study to challenge the view that English language development is unproblematic in anglophone higher education contexts for EAL students. Despite over a decade of concern and attempts by some institutions to addres the issues, the availale reearch shows that few intitutions have explicit police or stratgies focusing on this sse, and AL students are able to graduate without attaining the expected ELP outcomes. The research summarized in this article points to the challenge of explicitly developing ELP rather than assuming it ccur  osmosis. Spficll, it proidd idence that the witing skillnes to be targtd and that specific cohorts may be more at risk. It is therefore argued that the ELP of EAL students, whether intenational or domestic, cannot be assumed and should be a university's core business.

As students attending HEIs in traditional English-speaking countries have high expectations of a transformative experience and improved career outcomes, it i clear that anglophone nations cannot rest on their laurels at a time of increased internationalisation, EMI opportunities, and more competition from non-anglophone nations in the rankings. Further research i neded to investigate EAL students' linguistic outcomes, and action required if anglophone nations wish to maintain their place as destinations of choice. This should be a call to action for al institions to commit to gathering evidence in their ontext, and to delivering targeted sustainable support to ensure strong ELP outcomes.

There is a related research gap in anglophone nations including: the appropriate setting of standards for ELP by graduation, meeting the needs of a diverse range of students from domestic to international along the EFL/ESL to native speaker continuum; the ensuing impact on the design of content and assessment; and assessing ELP in higher education in a meaningful and valid way within disci. plinary learning. Despite some moves in the right direction, there remains much work to be done in order to assure our EAL students graduate with the English language levels that they expect and need for their futures.

# 6.1. Postscript

At the time of writing, international borders in Australia had re-opened after over eighteen months due to the coviD-19 pandemic. Many students had been studying offshore and online in their home countrie, and enrolments in Austalia had decreased considerably during this period (DESE, 2021). While closed borders may have been a short-term issue,studying offshore and/or online may become the norm. This may further diminish the assumed advantages of studying at an English-speaking HEI because of a reduction in immersion opportunities, an enriching intenational experience, or the chance to graduate with strong language sils. There may also be a range of pedagogical challenges that are yet to emerge from offshore online studies. The fallout from the covid-19 pandemic is therefore likely to both amplify and exacerbate the issues related to the ELP of EAL students studying in anglophone environments described in this article.
