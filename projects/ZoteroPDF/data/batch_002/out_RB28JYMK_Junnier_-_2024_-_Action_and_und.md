The semi-structured research interview is commonly used in EAP research to gain emic or insider perspectives. However, critics suggest that simplistic approaches to interview are pervasive, and that interview data is over-used and under-analysed by qualitative researchers. In this study, I consider the interactional nature of the EAP research interview by using the Conversation Analysis (CA) lens of action and understanding to enhance a more traditional qualitative analysis of interview data from semi-structured interviews with six European research scientists. I examine how the scientists position attitudes to the proposition that non-native English speakers are disadvantaged in writing for publication compared to their native speaker counterparts. The analysis focuses on how the scientists use pronominal subject $^ +$ cognitive verb discourse markers (e.g., you know, I mean, I guess) to mark stance, shift focus, and renegotiate the linguistic (dis) advantage proposition. In doing so, they move beyond the native/non-native binary and introduce non-discursive factors as barriers to research publication success. The study highlights how an analysis of both the structure and the content of interview talk can enrich understanding of the worldviews of interview participants. It also illustrates how EAP researchers might address existing methodological critiques concerning the simplistic use of interview data.

# 1. Introduction

Interviews are commonly used in social science research to gain emic or insider perspectives on the norms and practices of discourse communities (Olson, 2016). Within the EAP literature, for example, the semi-structured research interview is often used within a proces of triangulation as a method that can enrich and extend understandings (i., Li et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020) or allow the researcher to gain special insights or insider views (i.e., Davis, 2019; Neumann et al., 2019; Hynninen & Kuteeva, 2017). Moreover, in a longitudinal (2005-2016) analysis of research trends in the broader field of Applied Linguistics, the semi-structured interview was found to have noticeably increased as a research method during the study's analysis period (Lei & Liu, 2019). While the semistructured research interview has become a central method of inquiry in EAP research, recent qualitative methodologies scholarship has raised concerns that simplistic approaches to the research interview are pervasive and that interview data is both over-used and under-analysed (Silverman, 2017; Whitaker & Atkinson, 2019). Concerns over the proliferation and methodological robustnessof the research interview are by no means new (Holstein & Gubrium, 1995; Potter & Hepburn, 2012; Talmy, 2010). In particular, Holstein and Gubrium (1995) critiqued the neutral interviewer/answer-vessel respondent model of interviewing in their characterization of the active interview From an active interview perspective, the interview is asite for the production of meaning in which active subjects construct versions of reality interactionall (Gubrium & Holstein, 2002). Moreover, Talmy (2010) raised concerns about aproaches to interview in Applied Linguistics when he questioned whether the field's conceptualization of interview as a research instrument really did provide emic perspectives and discussed the advantages of reconceptualizing the research interview as a social practice.

As an approach more centrally concerned with the social and interactional aspects of research interviews, Conversation Analysis (CA) (Sacs et al, 1974) has proven to be a valuable analytical approach in reconceptualizing reearch interviews as instances of social action rather than \*neutral or unmediated conduits into participants iner psychological worlds (Prior, 2018,p. 491). CA's analytical focus on the engagement of interview participants in interactional activities as wellas with the overall tructure of interactions (Wofftt & Widdicombe, 2006), has allowed it to become a productive method for interview research in Applied Linguisics (e.g., Gardner, 1994; Kasper & Wagner, 2014; Prior, 2018; Prior & Talmy, 2019,; Roulston, 2011; Sert & Seedhouse, 2011). However, despite being an active area of cholarship in the sister field of Applied Linguistics, the interactional nature of the research interview remains largely over-looked in EAP/ESP research. Few recent studies (e.g., Davis, 2019; Hynninen & Kuteeva, 2017; Kaufhold & McGrath, 2019; Stenglin & Cleirigh, 2020; Xu & Zhang, 2019) examine interview data in its interactional context and even fewer studies have used CA to transcribe and analyse interview data (e.g., Han & Hyland, 2019). At a time when EAP/ESP researchers are being asked to engage with producers of texs more full though inerview (wales, 2019), it sms appropriate to reconsider the enefits of adopting more interactionally grounded methods of analysis.

This study gives renewed consideration to the interactional nature of the EAP research interview by llustrating how the CA concept of action and understanding can be used to enhance a more traditional qualitative analysis of data taken from a series of semistructured interviews with six European research scientists. Specificall, the analysis focuses on how the research scientists talk about linguistic disadvantage in writing for research publication. An interactionall grounded analysis of interview talk with those directly affected by the isue seemed particularly useful given the topic's renewed attention in the EAP literature (e.g., Flowerdew, 2019; Habibie, 202; Hultgren, 2020; Hyland, 2016; Politze-Ahles et al, 2016; Soler, 2021). On one hand, scholars suggest English as an additional lnguage (EAL) writers face significant additional linguistic burdens -- particularly as novices -- when writing for publication (Flowerdew, 2019; Polizer-Ahles et al., 2016). On the other hand, it is argued that academic English is no one's first language and that al scholarly writers regardes of their 1 must acquire this specialized competency (Hyland, 2016). Moreover, the argument is made that scholarly writing is a complex situated practice within which linguistic (dis)advantage (particularly defined along native/non-native lines) may not be the primary barrier faced by EAL scholars (Hyland, 2016; Kuteeva & Mauranen, 2014). As a result, to narrow a focus on language riss losing sight of the social, cultural, political, and economic conditions that also produce injustice (Hultgren, 2020).

# 1.1. Research questions

This study is guided by the following research questions.

(1) What are the attitudes of European research scientists toward linguistic disadvantage in writing for research publication purposes? (2) How does an interactionally grounded analysis of the interview talk enhance our understanding of those attitudes?

# 2. Research interviews and interactional context

The next section of this paper defines more closely the speech event of the research interview. I then elaborate on the central role of questions in that speech event before discusing why the conversation analytical lens of action and understanding is apropriate for the analysis of interview data. Finally, I introduce the role of pronominal subject $^ +$ cognitive verb discourse markers as useful contextual coordinates for the EAP analyst in the analysis of interview data.

# 2.1. Semi-structured interviews

Interviews are distinct types of speech events (Moder & Halleck, 1998) with distinct organizational structures and distinct re. lationships between participants. Semi-structured research interviews are commonly used in Applied Linguistics research (Lei & Liu, 2019). In these interviews, structured/pre-planned questions are used to elicit specific information, but the interviewer i also said to allow for a responsive exploration of the emerging worldview of the respondent, and to new ideas on the topic" (Merriam, 1998, p. 74). This orientation to pre-planned questions and emerging ideas results in a distinct organizational pattern. For instance, in a semi-structured interview, the interviewer might avoid question and answer patterns characteristic of a more structured interview to elicit longer turns from the interviewee (Schiffrin, 1994). Indeed, Merriam (1998) ugests polar (yes/no) questions should be avoided in the semi-structured interview in favor of other question designs that prompt fuller responses. In addition, there is usually an asymmetry of power and/or knowledge between participants (Schifri, 1994), with the interview frame itelf constraning the interactional roles of interviewer and interviewee (Moder & Haleck, 1998). Thus, the semi-structured interview functions as a hybrid or mixed speech event that exhibits characteristics similar to both institutional talk and conversation (Schifrin, 1994). As a result analyses of semi-structured interview data focusing solely on respondents' turns as "teling quotations" (Silverman, 2017) reveals a rather distorted picture of the speech event and ignores the central role of questions in the ongoing action of the semi-structured interview.

# 2.2. Questions in semi-structured interviews

Qualitative methods' textbooks discuss question design and sequencing in some detail (Flick, 2009; Merriam, 1998). However, emphasis is often placed on questions as stimuli that produce desired responses for subsequent analysis, rather than activities in an ongoing social interaction. From a CA point of view, however, questions do more than request a response; they implement a range of social actions that make a response relevant (Stivers & Rossano, 2010). Questions advance two agendas: a topical agenda (i.e., what is being talked about) and an action agenda (i.e., what the speaker is doing with the question) (Hayano, 2013). Action agendas have received much attention in the CA literature (Pomerantz & Heritage, 2013) particularly in relation to question preference (Sidell, 2010). More specifically in interview contexts, the design of polar questions ilt them in favor of either yes-type or no-type answers. For example, straight interrogatives (i.e., Do you believe $x ? .$ ) and negative interrogatives (i.e., Don't you believe $x ? .$ ) favor yes-type answers and negative assertions $^ +$ tag (i.e., You don't believe x, do you?) favor no-type answers (Clayman, 2013). On the other hand, topical agendas, as they relate to interviews, have received lessattention. In semi-structured research interviews, interviewers normall nitiate topical agendas with pre-planned questioning and manage shifts in topic as they occur. Therefore, the interviewer's acces to the eistemic domains of the interviewee ecomes extremely important in both setting topical agendas and managing topical shifts. This is particularly relevant to EAP/ESP researchers (community outsiders) aiming for insight into a discourse community's ways of knowing and doing by interviewing community insiders. However, this aspect of interview is not considered if we view questions as stimuli, which produce free and open responses as opposed to vehicles of social interaction, which constrain recipient responses through action and topical gendas. The next section of the paper discusses, in more practical terms, how the CA lens of action and understanding can provide the EAP researcher with n insighful and systematic approach to aspects of their interview data.

# 2.3. Action and understanding in semi-structured interviews

As a central concept within the CA tradition, action and understanding is principallyconcerned with how understanding is ach. ieved and sustained by participants in interaction. It provides a valuable lens for the study of interview data because f it focus on what participants are doing with thir alk (actions) and how participants sustain the talk through the grouping and sequencing of these actions (understanding). From an action and understanding perspective, therefore, the analyst views any single fragment of the interview talk as \*the unique product of multiple, intersecting organizations of practices" (Sidnel, 2010, p. 249). Moreover, in using this lens, the analyst understands that these practices reveal more about the beliefs and motivations of the interviewees than what is said alone. In short, while other analytical approaches might focus on what the interview is about, the CA lens of action and under. standing is more concerned with the structural underpinnings f the interview and assumes that language use is orderly \*at a minute level of detail' (idnell & Stvers, 2013, p. 36).It follows, therfore, that interview data should be transcribed and analysed in such a way that alows for the detailed analys of the interactional work of participants. However, these features are often diregarded from the analysis as noise' or unremarkable features of the talk in broader approaches to interview transcription and analysis (Sidnell, 2010).

Second, action and understanding is concerned with the knowledge claims that interactants assert, contest and defend in and through turns-at-talk" (Heritage, 2013, p. 370). A key concept here is intersubjectivity, or the mode by which understanding is produced and owned by participants in interaction (Heritage & Stivers, 2013). There is a strong conversational preference for organizing and progressing talk in sequences of paired actions also known as 'adjacency pairs' (e.g., offers-acceptances, requests-grantings, greetings-gretings) (idnell, 2010). In the semi-stuctured interview, these adjacency pars are typically in the form of questions and answers. From an action and understanding perspective, the first pair part (FP) of the adjacency pair , the question creates slot or context within which the second pair part (SPP) (e.g., the answer) becomes relevant (Schegloff, 1968). Therefore, question-answer adjacency pairs provide an ideal framework to analyse the intersubjective understandings of interview participants as they exhibit both prospective and retrospective dimensions (Sidnell, 2010), with the SPP \*displaying aspeaker's understanding of the first to which it responds" (Sidnel, 010, p.66). As such, questions should not be diregarded as stimuli fr response but integal to the intersubjective analysis of interview as a social action.

# 2.4. Intersubjectivity in semi-structured interviews

As previously mentioned, intersubjectivity is characterized as the production of understanding by participants in interaction (Heritage & Stivers, 2013). Central to this characterization is Benveniste's (1971) theory of subjectivity. Subjectivity i the ability of speakers to see themselves as subjects in the interaction and construct a self and other opposition between themselves and other discourse participants. At one and the same time, however, other discourse participants are also constituting their own subjectivity and constructing their own self-other oppositions. Benveniste (1971) describes this polarity of persons as a fundamental condition for language. Closely related to subjectivity is the concept of stance as speakers use linguistic subjectivity \*to expres their perceptions, feelings, opinions and evaluations in discourse (Baumgarten & House, 2007, p. 195). The most basic and prototypical sources of subjectivity in spoken discourse are pronominal subject $^ +$ cognitive verb combinations such as I think or you know (Scheibman, 2002). According to Scheibman (2002) these combinations allow speakers to personalize their talk or to mark atitude, evaluation, and empathy. For example, in addition to its prototypical cognitive meaning, I think can be used to modulate stance with both tentative (hedging) and deliberative (boosting) functions depending on its context of use (Aijmer, 1997). In addition, Karkkainen (2003) dis cusses how attention to the prosodic and sequentia deployment of Ithink reveals additional interactional and pragmatic functions such as the marking of discourse boundaries or the performance of facework. Karkkainen (2003) goes on to argue that as the semantic meanings of pronominal subject $^ +$ cognitive verb combinations such as I think, I don't know and I guess cannot not be aligned with their interactional and pragmatic functions, these combinations are developing into a specific set of discourse markers.

Schiffrin (1987) defines discourse markers as "sequentially dependent elements that bracket units of talk" (p. 31) thus providing "contextual coordinates" (Schfrin, 1987, p. 41) for the ongoing interaction. Other combinations such as you know and I mean have become prolific in everyday conversation and, through their expanded pragmatic use, have already undergone a type of sematic bleaching as part of a proces of grammaticalization (Clayman & Raymond, 2021). However, contrary to previous characterisations of these discourse markers as randomly placed filer phrase acking any communicative value, Fox Tree and Schrock (2002) suggest that the prolific use of these discourse markers in spontaneous speech can be atributed to each marker's basic meaning. For example, Schifrin (1987) suggests that I mean forewarns of upcoming adjustments to prior talk. When a speaker uses I mean they signal to the hearer that they are about to modify an idea in the discourse and that this modification is mportat. In this sense, I mean displays the speaker's intention to shift focus (Schifrin, 1987). Various accounts have also been provided for the basic meaning of you know (Clayman & Raymond, 2021; Smith and Jucker, 1998; Ostman, 1981). Ostman (1981) suggests that speakers use you know with the aim of encouraging the listener to collaborate or acknowledge the propositional content of the utterance as shared background knowledge while Smith and Jucker, 1998 suggest that you know invites addresee inference. More recently, Clayman and Raymond (2021) have sought to provide a unified account of how you know functions in ordinary conversation. They suggest that in its basic form, you know work a an intersubjectie or affiliative token of alignment in environments where understanding and affiliation have become salient or potentially problematic (Clayman & Raymond, 2021).

L1 speakers and L2 speakers of English may also use intersubjective discourse markers differently (Baumgarten & House, 2007 & 2010; House, 2009 & 2013). In an analys of I think and I don't know in Englis L1 and L2 conversation, Baumgarten and House (2010) found that the discourse markers exhibited only partilly overlapping functional profile, with 2 peakers more likely to use them in a more prototypical sense to mark opinion. Moreover, House (2009) sugests that you know has lost its other oriented' meaning and has been re-interpreted in L2 contexts as a special type of self-referencing connective used to preface formulation dificulties and aid semantic coherence between propositions. Finally, rather than a marker of reformulation/clarification, it is suggested that in L2 discourse I mean signals an emotional involvement and acts as a "focalizing device in the speakers contribution which serves as the point of departure for an explicit expression of a subjective evaluation' (Baumgarten & House, 2007, p. 208).

Whether we view these pronominal subject $^ +$ cognitive verb discourse markers as alignment tokens, inference invitations, or forewarnings, it sms cler that rather than dismiss them as iller phrases in the data tranription process ow intervie participants use them to structure response could provide the contextual coordinate for what interview participants are doing with that response. Moreover, while much of the existing research on I think, you know and I mean has discussed their functional import in everyday conversation, their use in research interview environments remains underexplored. Therefore, in adition to a traditional qualitative analysis of the interview data, this study examines the scientists' use of pronominal subject $^ +$ cognitive verb discourse markers and other interactional cues in positioning attitudes to the linguistic (dis)advantage proposition.

# 3. Method

Although CA is more traditionally used in the analysis f ordinary conversation, i is also a fitting way to work with institutional interactions among laypersons and professionals (Sidnell & Stivers, 2013) such as recorded data from semi-structured research interviews. Moreover, while some CA approaches take an agnostic stance on participants' opinions, beliefs, and atitudes (Potter & Hepburn, 2012), my aim in this study is to llustrate how an analysis of the structure of the tal can enrich an understanding of the meaning of the talk. Of course, I recognize that the interviewer can never inhabit the mind of the interviewee and that the theoretical underpinnings of CA dictate that utterances should first be understood as activities. However, understanding an utterance first as an activity in interaction does not prevent the analyst from engaging with that utterances \*wider meaningful dimensions of human experience (Woffit & Widdicombe, 2006, p. 49) particularlyas they relate to mattersof identity and agency. In the following section, I provide further information on the participants, data selection, transcription, and analysis procedures.

# 3.1. Participants

The six participants in the study are European-based or European-background research scientists who work in the biological sci. ences. I had known Renzo, Amelia, Tom and Emma for several years prior to conducting the interviews and got to know Maria and Walter through Renzo. We had all shared linking paths as European academics and researchers who had become internationally mobile for career purposes. We had studied or worked at the same universties and had spent time together socially sharing our experiences of living and raising children in inguistic and cultural contexts that were not our own. Each of the participants had completed a master's degree or PhD in their respective European country of origin. They had since experienced high levels of mobility and had worked in both Anglophone (i.e., UK and north American) and non-Anglophone contexts (i.e., continental Europe). The dynamic and contested nature of a person's linguistic identity is especill relevant for individuals who find themselves indiferent socio-cultural contexts as they move across geographical and psychological borders (Block, 2007). The participants in this study have moved acros linguistic, disciplinary, and physical boundaries to pursue their research carers, within which publishing in English medium journals is a key dynamic. They were interviewed as part of a larger IRB approved study on the construction of authorial identity. Each interview lasted approximately $^ { 1 \mathrm { h } }$ was audio-recorded, and subsequently broadly transcribed. Broad transcription provides a general representation of the spoken discourse, emphasiing the content, discourse structure, and the overall flow of interaction. ll articipants reviewedthe accuracy of these broad transcripts and provided additional commentary when necessary. Table 1 provides an overview of each of the participants. All names are pseudonyms selected by the participants.

# 3.2. Data selection, transcription and analysis

For the purposes of this study, I conduct an analysis f one question-answer adjacency pair from all ix interviews. The decision for the analytical focus on just one question-answer adjacency pair is twofold. First, the level of detailed transcription and analysis required in CA limits the amount of data that can be analysed in any one paper. Second, because issues related to identity and self are \*handled in the turn-by-turn production of activities ininteraction." (Woffit & Widdicombe, 2006, p. 49), questions related to the scientists' attitudes and self-percetions about inguistic disadvantage seemed optimal for conversation analytical treatment. Moreover, the adjacency pair is initiated with a polar (yes/no) question. Despite the tendency in qualitative research to eschew polar questions in semi-structured interview format, polar questions are particularly interesting to examine from an action and under. standing perspective because not only do they tightly constrain participant responses, but they also embed presuppositions (Hayano, 2013). Other polar questions were asked over the course of the interview, but this question was selected for analysis as it was the only question which directly dealt with linguistic disadvantage. Therefore, the audio-recordings of the linguistic disadvantage polar question-answer adjacency pairs were more closely transcribed using conventions from the Jeffersonian system (Jefferson, 2004) and the Handbook of Conversation Analysis (Hepburn & Bolden, 2013)(see Appendix A). The audio-recordings were listened to multiple times to capture various features of the delivery of the talk that are, from a CA perspective, basic to how interlocutors build actions and respond to the actions of others (Hepburn & Bolden, 2013, p. 104). Indeed, rather than ignoring features such as fillers, pauses, and false starts, these features were paid close atention to in the transcription process. Audio files were also converted to WA files and run through the speech analysis software Prat (Boersma & Weenink, 2021) to help verify my manual transcription of pauses, emphasis, and intonation. Although manual or auditory analysis is more common within CA, the combination of auditory (careful, repeated listening) and acoustic (machine-generated) analysis is becoming more widespread (Walker, 2013)

In approaching the data from a CA perspective, Sacks (1984) suggests that observation is a basis for theorizing. This means that the interview data should not be approached by pre-specified analytic goals but by noticings of nitially unremarkable features of the talk or of other conduct (idnel, 010, p. 130). It was through the processof listening to and closely transcribing the audio-recordings that the participants' frequent use of pronominal subject $^ +$ cognitive verb discourse markers such as I think, you know and I mean, became evident. I then began to focus on the use of these combinations acros allsix interviews. In short, the analysis is driven by initial noticings, which then led to further observations as I looked across all six question-answer adjacency pairs.

# 4. Analysis

The issue of whether EAL scholars are disadvantaged compared to their native speaker counterparts in writing for research publication continues to be a topic of considerable debate in Applied Linguistics scholarship (e.g., Flowerdew; 2019, Habibie, 2022; Hultgren, 2020; Hyland, 2016; Politzer-Ahles et al., 2016; Soler, 2021). During each of the interviews, asked the research scientists about linguisic disadvantage in writing for research publication. In the first section of this analysis, Ireport on their responses in a style typical of some contemporary qualitative interview research in EAP/EAP studies. In this reporting style, the responses are summarized or categorized in some way ofte thematically) and quotes from interviewees are extracted as a form of playscript (Potter & Hepburn, 2012). In other words, questions are typically omitted, extracts are cleaned up' into mostly grammatical sentences, and conventional orthographic representation of talk is used (Potter & Hepburn, 2012).

4.1. Reporting insights: European research scientists' attitudes toward linguistic disadvantage

# 4.1.1. Accepting the disadvantage hypothesis

Amelia, Tom, and Renzo were al senior scientists from Italy who had become faculty at large research universties in the SA. Tom had transferred his PhD from Italy tothe USA and subsequently worked in various post-doctoral, adjunct, and faculty positions before returning t Italy. Renzo and Amelia had firs completed their PhDs in the UK before moving to the USA later in their careers. ll three strongly agred that they were disadantaged as EAL scholars in writing for research publication. Amelia most srongly agreed that she felt disadvantaged due to her language proficiency, I always feel like I'm not good enough or my ideas are not good enough or my English is not good enough." Amelia discussed her struggle with writing linearly" as a specific problem. The idea of having a nonlinear writingstyle was also discussed by Tom and Renzo. They suggested that writing for academic purposes in Italian allowed for longer and more comple sentences and they had dificulty adapting to what they saw as shorter simple sentence structures in aca demic English. However, Tom and Renzo also recognized that linguistic disadvantages might not be experienced in the same way by all EAL scholars and that over time the disadvantages lesened. For example, Tom discussed EAL scholar cllagues who he believed did not face the same struggles as he dd in writing for publication. om atributed this to his coleagues motivation to lean English earlier in life these are people that had the experience and the motivation to learn English when they were younger in high schoo. Renzo also acknowledged his own struggles in writing in English, particularly as he was beginning his career. His position aligns with the notion that novice EAL writers experience additional burdens or need to exert aditionaleffort when writing for research purposes (Flowerdew, 2019; Politzer-Ahles et al., 2016). However, Renzo added that these struggles had lessened over time \*compared to a native speaker I had a steer learning curve to begin with, but then, after that initial struggle, I'm mor or les at the same level as a native speaker." In short each of these senior scientists accepted some degre f disadvantage due to their status as EAL academic writers.

# 4.1.2. Challenging the disadvantage hypothesis

Maria and Walter were the youngest and most junior scientists Iinterviewed. When I interviewed Maria, she was finishing her PhD in Spain and had ben conducting ashort-term research project in Renzo's lab in the USA.Maria also acknowledged the difficulties she faced as a novice EAL writer but seemed to downplay the extent of these dificulties. For Maria, the main ssue was not with sentence structure, but at the lexical eel. Shealso expressed her frustration at the time t took her  write in a more foral ristr feel that I'm losing at ton of time just looking for words." Walter was even les quick to take up the disadvantage theme of the question. He had recently completed his PhD in France before moving to the USA and then to Switzerland as a research fellow. Walter felt that while writing for research publication might be easier for native speakers of English, he didn't necessarily fee disadvantaged and accepted writing in English as part of his job. In doing so, he took a more instrumental approach to the topic than the other participants and conceptualized language as an important too in his career s  scientist stating, t's a part of our job to len English and being able to speak English and write in English." In sum, these younger scientists were les keen to fully take up the disadvantage hypothesis.

# 4.1.3. Rejecting the disadvantage hypothesis

Emma was the only participant to state that she had not felt disadvantaged in writing for publication as an EAL scholar. She was working as a research fellow in her home country of Germany when I interviewed her early in 2022. Her return home' had been preceded by several international moves within Europe and the USA. While Emma stated that she had not felt disadvantaged, she did acknowledge that she had to fight against her own linguistic biases when reviewing manuscripts \*when I was reviewing things, I felt like I was biased. For example, if I read an article in which the English wasn't very good, I felt biased from the beginning." Despite acknowledging that such biases existed, she also stated that since so many scholars were non-native writers, such biases in the peer review process may eventually be balanced out.

# 4.2. Capturing talk-in-interaction: European research scientists' attitudes toward linguistic disadvantage

In this subsequent interctionally grounded analysis, I highlight some important interactional feature of the talk that enhance, and at times question, th traditional qualitative analysis in section 4.1. Specificlly, I focus on how the scientists peform interactional work by using pronominal subject $^ +$ cognitive verb discourse markers to (i) modulate stance (ii) shift focus and (ii) strive for affiliation in renegotiating the presupposition of the question. Moreover, this analysis includes how the question was asked on each ocasion and how the interviewes interacted with the question. As previously noted, questions shape and constrain responses. My use of a polar question constrained the type f answers that were possible. The interviewees could either provide a relevant answer ie, yes-type or no-type) and thus acept the disadvantage proposition. Alternatively, they could perform the interactional work that brings \*the presupposition to the surface of the interaction (Levinson, 1983, p. 396). Moreover, the question was framed in POBA (Perceptions, Opinions, Beliefs and Atitudes terms wit the phrase "have you felt ..". Prompting a discussion of the interviewees' feeings (as opposed to their knowledge) on the ssue increased the interactional demands but lessened the epistemic demands of the question (Potter & Hepburn, 2012). Appendices B- G show the complete transcript of the six question-answer adjacency pairs transcribed using conventions from the Jeffrson, 2004 system and the Handbook of Conversation Analysi (Hepburn & Bolden, 2013). Transcripts are listed alphabetically by name of participant. The excerpts in the following sections retain the format and numberin from Appendices B - G, but bold text is added to highlight the specific interactional features under analysis.

# 4.2.1. Modulating stance: "I think ... I hope ... I guess"

In the initial analysis, it was noted that Emma was the only participant who did not personall feel disadvantaged in writing for publication. In excerpt 1, we see how she produces this 'no-type' response after a pause, hesitation, and a pronominal subject $^ +$ cognitive verb combination. In tun initial position, I think can be used do "face-work at points of trouble in interaction (Karkkainen, 2003, p. 183). Notably, these instances of facework receive strong prosodic emphasis, which is consistent with Emma's deployment of ! think at a distinctly higher pitch than the rest of the response (line 6). Her use of this initial pronominal subject $^ +$ cognitive verb discourse marker has an interactional function by mitigating her dispreferred (no-type) response to a question that has a design preference for a yes-type answer.

As previously discussed in section 4.1, Emma then acknowledged the need to combat her own linguistic biases while working as a reviewer (see Appendix C, line 12). What is perhaps lost in the previous reporting of Emma's answer is the way in which she builds her response with a number of pronominal subject $^ +$ cognitive verb constructions such as I think, I hope and I guess (see excerpt 2). Unlike her first use of I think to perform facework, these constructions do reveal her evaluation of the topic and act as an \*intersubjective stance frame that organizes the stance taking activity between conversational co-participants (Karkkainen, 2007, p. 184). Interestingly, as she builds her response, her stance becomes les certain. She begins with a booting I think (line 21) which she abandons for ! hope (line 22). She then uses a prosodically marked I gues (line 26) in turn final position to hedge her prior proposition that linguistic biases will be balanced out..

The prosodic and sequential employment of the discourse markers used by Emma in her answer reveal how she modulated her subjective evaluation of how linguistic disadvantage, or more specifically bias, may be reproduced in academic publishing gatekeeping roles. Her weakening commitment to her balancing out hypothesis is only revealed in this closer transcription and analysis of both the structure and the content of her answer.

# 4.2.2. Shifting focus: "I mean there is a disadvantage"

In the previous analysis, stated that Tom and Renzo strongly agreed that they were disadvantaged as EAL scholars in writing for research publication. In this eanced analysis, hwer, we  w their use f dicourse markrs as wel as proodic ftres of their talk might question the strength of this agreement In excerpt 3, Tom seemingly aligns with the proposition of the question by pro ducing an esecially loud wel yeh of course (line 5), which he begins before  have finished my tun at talk. From a ontent perspective. this looks like a strong yes-type response that acepts the presupposition embedded in the FPP. But from an action and understanding perspective, the lodnessf his ronse ca e inerpretd s pefming  disaffiliative function. he rlaonship btwen utterances can be expressed by hfts in amplitude and increases in amplitude work to disaffliate a new course of action from a prior utterance (Couper-Kuhlen, 2004). Tom's especill loud response can be interpreted as his intention to begin a new course of action rather than a strong alignment with the question. Next, Tom again seems to align with the question by repeating one part of the presupposition with there is disdantge (line 6). However, he prefaces this reettion with the intersubjective discourse marker I mean and then attempts to qualify who is disadvantaged with epecill f you are, which he then abandons for if you don't know English (line 7). As previously noted, I mean can be used to forewarn of upcoming adjustments and shifts in focus (Schifri, 1987). Tom uses it here as a means of shifting focus to his evaluation that the disadvantage lie in not knowing English, whichi related to, but not equivalent to non-native speaker status.

In excerpt 4, we also see how Renzo seemingly aligns with the disadvantage proposition in the content of his talk with an initial response f wellfor sure (line5. However, he alo uses the intersubjective discourse marker I mean immedately afer thi lignment. mean acts as a point of departure for his re-focusing of the topic to growth on a novice to expert continum.

In short, whil both Renzo and Tom initially provide strongly aligning utterances in the content of thir talk, they then use the discourse marker I mean to shift the focus to competence on a novice to expert continum rather than a fixed native/non-native dichotomy.

# 4.2.3. Striving for affiliation: or you know, my ideas are not good enough

Tom, Maria, Walter, and Ameliall used the discourse marker you know to maintain intersubjectvity and afiliate with the question at points in their answers where they renegotiate the topical agenda of the question. In the previous analysis, I suggested that Amelia strongly aligned with the proposition of the question by stating that she felt disadvantaged "every ingle time'. What the interactionally focused transcritio of the question-answer djacency pair in excerpt  reveals is that even before I finish the question, she interjects with the surpris token oy (line 3). She produces this token of surprise afer I introduce the disadvantage proposition but before I introduce language as the specific driver of that disadvantage. In addition to signaling an affectie stance toward a proposition, tokens of surprise also have an affiliative function signaling a shared understanding between interlocutors (Wilkinson & Kitzinger, 2006). Amelia then employs the discourse marker you know as a further token of affliation. As previously decribed, you know works as an intersubjective token of affliation in environments where understanding and alignment have become salient or potentially problematic (Clayman & Raymond, 2021). Ameliauses it here to change the topical agenda from a linguistic disadvantage proposition to a not good enough proposition. She uses or you know to preface the notion that her ideas, in addition to her English language proficiency, may be the disadvantage. What is also misse in the previous analysis i that immediately prior to this not good enough topic change, she produces the term even now twice in miley voice with a burst f laughter etween each utterance. Laughter is deployed for specific purposes in interaction and is coordinated with other ongoing conversational activities (Ruusuvuori, 2012). Moreover, to evoke sympathy and reduce the likelihood of negative judgments, women are more likely to make self-directed humorous commentaries about themselves to other women that they know well (Lampert & Ervin-Tripp, 2006). Amelia's self-directed laughter prefaces the confessional self-disclosure to me as both the interviewer and a friend of her more general insecurities as a scholar.

Tom also uses the discourse marker you know to preface topical renegotiations. In excerpt 6, we see how he uses a so you know construction to mark the beginning of a sequence in which he advances other topics such as personality type (line 22) and socioeconomic background (lines 26 & 27) as alternative factors in the (dis)advantage proposition.

While Tom renegotiated the primacy of language in the proposition, Walter sees to downgrade the notion of disadvantage itself (see excerpt 7). Walter fronts his part of the job renegotiation of the disadvantage proposition with the intersubjective token of you now. Prefacing his renegotiation in this way invites me as the interviewer and community outsider to acept the propositional content of his downgraded response as mutual background knowledge.

It is also worth noting that not all uses of you know by the interviewees had this intersubjective function. In line with previous research on the use of the discourse marker by L2 speakers (House, 2009, you know was also used as a self-referencing connective to preface formulation dificulties and aid semantic coherence between propositios. When used as a self-eferencing connective, you know exhibits certain prosodic cues (i.., quicker rates of production, pitch changes ec.) and it is typically deployed in turn medial position and within the repair space (Clayman & Raymond, 2021; House, 2009). In excerpt 8, we can see how Maria deploys the discourse marker in smiley voice followed by a quick burst of quiet laughter to aid in production diffculties as she searches for the word subject (line 31) and to connect the ideas that knowing how tostructure her writing means being able to use passive voice (line 33).

# 5. Discussion

This study attempts to show how features of interview talk that might be considered inconsequential fller phrases can provide additional interactional information to enhance the analysis of interview data. In the transcribed data from one question-answer adjacency pair across six semi-structured interviews, pronominal subject $^ +$ cognitive verb discourse markers were used by each of the interview participants to perform a number of interactional and pragmatic functions. An examination of the prosodic and sequential deployment of these makers and other interactional features of the interview tal allowed for aricher understanding of how the participants worked to position themselves to the propositional content of the question. The analysis underscores that the research interview cannot be characterized as a research instrument in which questions are deployed as stimuli for response, but rather as a social action where participants' collaboratively shape the interaction in explicit and subtle ways (Prior, 2018). Each of the participants interviewed in this study used discourse markers in ways previously identified in both L1 and L2 contexts to affliate plan, shit focus, and mark stance to construct their responses.

Furthermore, the interactionall grounded approach to the data provides insight into how a group of European research scientists think about linguistic disadvantage in writing for research publication puroses. Renzoshifte focus to emphasize his growth as an EAL writer on a novice to expert continuum rather than accepting the fixed native/non-native dichotomy. His description of a steeper learning curve does lign, however, with the notion that novice EAL scholars experience aditional linguistic burdens when writing for research purposes (Flowerdew, 2019). Amelia and Tom did interactional work to challenge the primacy of language in the linguistic disadvantage proposition by sugesting that socio-economic background, motivation, or scholarly ability may be more salient factors in a (dis)advantage hypothesis. These topical renegotiations align with arguments that physical, scholarly, and financial factors may pose greater barriers than language in publication success for EAL scholars (Hyland, 2016). Moreover, although Walter and Maria acknowledged that language was a factor in writing for publication, they downgraded the disadvantage part of the proposition, by reformulating disadvantage to an aspect of the job or as something that just takes more time. It was also interesting to note that the three more novice (and younger) scholars (Emma, Walter, and Maria) either rejected or produced a weak alignment to the linguistic (dis) advantage proposition while the more experienced (and older cholars initilly produced stronger aliging uterances before going on to shift focus or renegotiate the topical agenda.

To conclude, applying a CA lens to the intersubjective actions of my interview participants revealed how they sought to afiliate. shift focus, and renegotiate the topical agenda of my lingustic disadvantage question. The detailed analysis of question-answer ad. jacency pairs also prompted me to think more closely about the central role of question design and my positioning to the propositional content of the questions. Future research plans include applying a CA lens to my questioning strategies to track my stance as an interviewer and community outsider throughout the research project. Moreover, rather than being done retrospectively, this type of interactional analysis of question design and questioning strategies would be a useful self-reflexive tool for researchers during a research project. CA can also be partilly incorporated by researchers using other analytical methods for their interview data. For example, polar questions could be intentionally used in target sections of an interview and then analysed using a CA approach to examine disciplinary hypotheses. Such analyses might focus on other interactional features of interview talk such as the performative aspects of emotio, interactional conflicts or dificultie repair) or any other salient feature of the talk-in-interaction. Undoubtedly, the level of detailed transcription and analysis required in any CA project can seem daunting. For those new to CA transcription, Hepburn (2023) provides an excellent and accessble online resource with utorial on transcription conventions, practice transcription worksheets, and audio recording. Of course, adopting a CA approach willnot be viable or desirable i all interview analysis contexts. However, this study demonstrates one way in which greater atention to the interactional aspects of interviews can help address the methodological critiques concerning the over-use and under-analysis of interview data in EAP/ESP research.
