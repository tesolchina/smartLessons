This timely publication should be read by everyone who is involved in language teaching, internationalisation and higher education teaching and learning e a deliberately broad recommendation that underlines its achievements. The book is part of the series entitled New Perspectives on Language and Education:82 under the editorship of Viv Edwards, Phan Le Ha and Jo Windle that focuses on perspectives on teaching and learning as well as language and literacy at a time when education systems face continual change in terms of economics and technology. Along with this there are also issues and questions relating to identity, power, community and culture.

Bond’s book emerged as a result of an institutionally funded scholarship project in an area that she feels is lacking in many English for Academic Purposes (EAP) practitioners’ personal journeys that therefore needs greater visibility and support. It explores the roles that language plays in shaping discipline specific knowledge and understanding, and was guided by this specific question: How do taught postgraduate tutors and students experience the intersection of language and disciplinary knowledge communication, and what impact does this have on their identities?

From what could have been a conventional monograph, Bond has produced a text that successfully raises questions and inspires in equal measure. Focussing on the practice of teaching and the learning of primarily English as an Additional Language (EAL) in a ’research intensive’ university, she draws on an enviably broad range of theories to help explain the themes arising from her research process, and examines how this may impact future teaching and learning practices. Bond evaluates her data by exploring what could be seen as obvious in terms of genre and discourse analysis, academic literacies and critical EAP, but extends the analysis to look at Threshold Concepts (Meyer & Land, 2003) as well as drawing in sociological concepts of structure, identity and agency.

Although the examples, experiences and the conclusions are firmly located within the specific personal and institutional context of the taught post-graduate curriculum within the United Kingdom, many of the issues and questions asked will provide a basis for discussions in other international contexts and other levels of study. In addition, the author proposes an approach to problem solving, a language heuristic, that offers a way for those involved in curricular and policy decisions to approach the issues at hand. This heuristic is comprised of six areas that impact pedagogical content knowledge - pedagogical knowledge, content knowledge, knowledge communication, cultural capital, social capital and threshold concept. These areas also provide some organisational logic for the structure of the book.

In the introduction to the book, the author contextualises her original question, and considers how internationalisation and EAP interact across higher education; for example, how they construct the conditions that have led to the key issues that the book addresses. A valuable discussion here is around the definition of ‘international student’ and the body of literature that seeks to define this term. So often in universities it is the go-to term used for EAL students that only serves to ‘other’ and problematise them; however, the author supports the welcome view that it’s partially a question of looking at the issue from the perspective that all students need to see themselves as ’international’ and avail themselves of the opportunities of global mobility. The term ’EAP’ also comes in for some scrutiny and, more specifically, the roles and teaching responsibilities of the EAP tutor. Drawing on Ding and Bruce (2017) Bond acknowledges the marginalisation of EAP practitioners within universities and the suggestion that this is partially self-inflicted due to a lack of the kind of disciplinary scholarship and research that is highly valued in most universities. The suggested result is the confusion in role and value of EAP practitioners and departments; at best seen as having value with embedded support dealing with issues of language, and at worst what Raimes (1991) called ‘the butler’s stance’ helping to ‘fix’ what is perceived as being wrong.

The author explores the scholarship of learning and teaching and her own approach in terms of methods of inquiry, highlighting that at times the lines between pedagogical approach and means of inquiry can become indistinct. She outlines the initial project which was around exploring the significant roles language plays in shaping discipline specific knowledge and understanding. She then explores different theories and methodologies, constantly seeing it through the lens of scholarship for practice and for practitioners and students. This approach is paramount throughout the book and can be seen in the inclusion of practical lessons and questions at the end of most chapters that will no doubt be useful starting points for internal discussions for professional development. The book is divided into eight chapters starting with her research as accidental scholar, tracing the journey of two students and then exploring language in and across the curriculum and questioning the place of EAP, culminating in implications for institutional policy and strategy.

Throughout, the book is an honest (Bond uses the word ‘messy’ more than once) account of her self-perception as an accidental scholar, and it also includes a credible insight into the personal, yet diverse journeys of two students from different academic schools and disciplines i.e. a STEM subject, and the Arts/Humanities. Both students attended classes in the EAP unit before joining their receiving departments with differing outcomes. What follows is a detailed and informative narrative of their learning trajectories, with a focus on specific issues, agency and identity. These scholar-student narratives provide a humanistic perspective in contrast to books that double-down on theory and methodology.

A number of clear themes intertwine to explore the relationship between language and the academic curriculum, language and academic norms, the place of EAP and language across the curriculum, content knowledge, knowledge communication, cultural and social capital, threshold concepts and developing pedagogical content knowledge being some of the more developed themes. Ultimately it is the taught post-graduate curriculum itself that is brought into sharp focus in terms of how it is constructed and (mis)understood by many academics and students. In particular, Bond explores what the “highly international interaction with the curriculum has on individuals in terms of: their identity; their understanding and use of time; their trust in the curriculum; and in terms of their ability to make agential choices” (p.53). Of particular interest here is the focus on changing identities, not only from the perspective of students, but also of tutors, who share with readers their insights with regard to understanding who they are in relation to the curriculum (when language becomes an issue), and also in response to one another. Issues of confidence rise to the surface, as does confusion on how best to communicate with students in an appropriate manner.

Convincing too are the very real issues Bond raises about of time, in view of the fact that students from other countries are attracted to the UK’s one-year taught Masters, but wrestle with the demands of academic study and language over what is ultimately a very brief period. Tutors in both language and content areas in turn note what seems to be an insuperable challenge of trying to achieve their expected goals, while at the same time building meaningful relationships with complex student cohorts.

These strands circle around the key theme in the book: the author’s focus on the intersection of language and content knowledge, and the definitive sense that trying to separate them is ultimately a false dichotomy. However, her conclusion does not manifest itself as the fulfilment of a pre-conceived hypothesis, but rather as a practice-based analysis revealing that any division between the two is quite challenging. It is often not clear how a separation can be pinpointed even if it is desired. Other areas covered in the book will be familiar to many practitioners: language knowledge and use, the comprehensive impact of the student experience, language and the implicit link to social and cultural capital, and language and the occluded curriculum. While the book’s main conclusion that the need for EAP tutors to work in partnership with content lecturers “in order to enable students to cross the linguistic threshold of language use for disciplinary academic purposes” (p.148), is not new, it is no less valuable for being reiterated in this book.

What does feel fresh is a realistic discussion of the current problems this brings on all sides and also the ultimate institutional rethink that is required. Massification of higher education is here and there is no point wishing it away (as we may sometimes want to), so Bond’s approach is: “What are we going to do about it?” Some of the EAP practitioners questioned for the book felt very strongly that they were required to teach language and skills only, however these terms are defined. Others expressed the need to engage with their disciplinary colleagues in order to address discourse competence and fulfil students’ complex needs, but were often at a loss at the comprehensive shift that this would require. The author acknowledges that this is an area that needs greater attention since there is “a lack of knowledge around how to de-code complex texts and discourses to enable students to access the necessary knowledge” (p.174), but she also suggests that this need for attention can no longer be avoided. In order to bridge this language-content divide, the author suggests that the six outer strands of the language heuristic need to be connected more tightly into the curriculum and that this can be achieved by EAP practitioners and content tutors working collaboratively and co-constructing so that knowledge communication can take place more effectively.

It is the institutional responsibility and role that adds an extra layer of interest to Bond’s discussion. As readers, we are presented with convincing scholarship which suggests possibilities for both students and academics, but not necessarily within current institutional constructs. Implicit within the book is the UK’s cross-subsidisation of certain areas e.g. research with income from international fees, but Bond’s critique doesn’t come fully enmeshed in an over-arching critique of the neoliberal model (even if there is a quick reference to the ‘greedy system’ (p193)). It offers more measured and convincing suggestions about of how the language-content nexus can be better managed, benefiting all. Here, Bond builds on arguments that EAP practitioners will know and mainly support, since EAP has moved away from the “ivory ghetto of remediation” (Swales, 1990, p. 6) to learning that is available to all and focuses on “enabling access to knowledge and developing expertise in academic communication” (p.195).

Some will argue that despite the suggestions put forward, it is not entirely clear how this change is to be achieved in a way that is financially viable and also expedient, but that may be asking too much. What this book does do is to highlight what is or may be possible. At minimum, the book should foster internal discussions amongst EAP practitioners and managers about the value of scholarship and research, but in many ways it is the need to be read by others across the institution that will prove more valuable. Ultimately, Making Language Visible in the University feels throughout like a book written for ‘us’ with huge potential for an external audience, as opposed to what frequently feels like vice versa. For that alone, Bond is to be praised for no mean feat.
