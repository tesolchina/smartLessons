# 1. Introduction

Anecdotal	evidence	suggests	that	teaching	and	learning	in	post-primary	education	in	Ireland	are	too heavily influenced	 by	 inappropriate,	 formal	 examinations.	 This	 results	 in	 teaching	 and	 learning behaviour	 being	 geared	 towards	 rote	 learning.	 The	 timing	 for	 the	 introduction	 of	 ‘‘transformative pedagogy’’	 in	 the	 context	 of	 Irish	 education	 therefore,	 is	 right.	 Recent	 changes	 in	 the	 Irish	 postprimary,	 junior	 cycle	 curriculum,	 as	 well	 as	 in	 initial	 post-primary	 teacher	 education	 programmes, suggest	an	urgent	need	for	the	traditional	‘‘banking’’	model	(Freire,	1970)	to	be	replaced	by	a	model that	 is	 more	 supportive	 of	 self-directed	 teaching	 and	 learning	 that	 is	 underpinned	 by	 moral-ethical values.	‘‘Transformative	pedagogy’’	offers	such	a	model.

The	 paper	 examines	 the	 impact	 of	 ‘‘transformative	 pedagogy’’	 that	 places	 teacher	 and	 pupils (participants)	 as	 whole	 persons	 at	 the	 centre	 of	 the	 educational	 project.	 It	 examines	 the	 construct from	philosophical,	psychological	and	social	perspectives	It	builds	on	a	recent	study	carried	out	over	a two-year	 period	 by	 the	 author	 in	 collaboration	 with	 teacher	 educators	 (tutors,	 mentors),	 studentteachers,	and	post-primary	pupils,	in	the	context	of	foreign	language	teacher	education	in	the	School of	 Education	 at	 the	 National	 University	 of	 Ireland,	 Galway	 (NUIG).	 The	 NUIG	 study	 examined	 the impact	of	autonomous	teaching	and	learning,	and	took	an	action	research	approach.	Links	are	made	in this	paper	to	the	study,	where	possible.	In	the	study,	qualitative	data	was	collected	from	educators	at the	 end	 of	 years	 1	 and	 2	 in	 the	 context	 of	 focus	 group	 discussions,	 from	 student-teachers	 in	 the context	 of	 semi-structured	 interviews,	 and	 quantitative	 and	 qualitative	 was	 collected	 from	 postprimary	 pupils	 in	 the	 context	 of	 a	 survey.	 Year	 2	 offered	 a	 more	 focused	 study	 with	 fewer	 studentteachers.	A	version	of	the	European	Language	Portfolio	was	used	as	a	process	tool.	It	was	the	first	time that	 this	 technology/artefact	 was	 used	 in	 pre-service	 teacher	 education	 in	 Europe.	 The	 focus	 of	 the current	paper	is	not	on	examining	this	NUIG	study	per	se,	but	to	link	key	findings	from	it	to	knowledge derived	from	the	literature,	(e.g.	moral-ethical	values),	and	from	my	understanding	of	key	implications of	recent	changes	for	teacher	education.

‘‘Transformative	 pedagogy’’	 creates	 conditions	 that	 support	 teacher	 and	 pupils	 (participants)	 in developing	 their	 identity	 as	 persons	 in	 relation	 to	 one	 another.	 Participants	 accept	 responsibility	 for expressing	 their	 meanings	 that	 implies	 metacognitive	 and	 socio-affective	 factors,	 and	 social interaction	 The	 construct	 supports	 participants	 in	 making	 connections	 between meaning	 making	 in class	and	meaning	making	in	the	world.	Interaction	in	the	school	is	informed	by	moral-ethical	values that	support	participants	in	developing	self-awareness	and	social	awareness.	‘‘Being-in-relation’’	and ‘‘being-in-becoming’’	are	two	interlinked	terms	that	express	social	interdependence	and	the	capacity to	self-direct	and	by	implication,	to	bring	about	improvement.

First,	we	examine	the	background	and	context	of	the	study,	including	particular	challenges	in	Irish education.	 Then,	 the	 construct	 of	 ‘‘transformative	 pedagogy’’	 is	 outlined.	 Its	 key	 features	 are summarised	 as	 well	 as	 key	 distinctions	 made	 between	 it	 and	 other	 relevant	 pedagogies.	 Where appropriate	the	study	refers	to	findings	for	the	collaborative,	action	research	study	carried	out	at	the National	University	of	Ireland.	The	focus	of	the	study	is	on	key	perspectives	that	are	used	to	frame	the discussion.	 They	 are:	 1)	 identity,	 2)	 beliefs	 and	 attitudes,	 3)	 knowledge,	 4)	 moral-ethical	 values,	 5) socio-affective	factors,	6)	social interaction	and	collaboration,	7)	critical	reflection,	8)	school	and	wider society.

# 2.	Background	and	Context

In	 recent	 years	 in	 Ireland,	 public	 discourse	 has	 been	 dominated	 by	 economics.	 There	 have	 been structural	and	curricular	reforms	in	Irish	education	in	recent	years	too.	For	example,	since	September 2014,	 post-primary	 teacher	 education	 involves	 taking	 a	 two-year	 Professional	 Master	 of	 Education (PME)	programme.	There	have	been	reforms	in	school	programmes	also,	and	proposals	for	changes	in assessment	methods	for	subjects,	including	modern	languages.	Key	aims	of	junior	cycle	reform	include making	 the	 teaching	 and	 learning	 process	 more	 learner-centred,	 and	 giving	 more	 autonomy	 and flexibility	 to	 schools	 ‘‘to	 involve	 students	 and	 their	 parents	 in	 the	 discussion	 about	 the	 kind	 of programme	 that	 will	 best	 serve	 the	 needs	 of	 the	 students	 and	 the	 school’’	 (Framework	 for	 Junior Cycle,	 DES,	 2011).	 Key	 principles	 of	 the	 new	 Junior	 Cycle	 are:	 quality,	 innovation	 and	 creativity, engagement	and participation,	continuity	and	development,	choice	and	flexibility,	well-being,	inclusive education	 and	 learning	 to	 learn.	 The	 Framework	 provides	 ‘‘Statements	 of	 Learning-Explanations	 of Learning	 Experiences’’	 that	 span	 different	 subject	 areas	 across	 the	 curriculum.	 Included	 in	 these Statements	are	values	that	include	appreciating	and	respecting	diverse	values,	beliefs	and	traditions; what	 it	 means	 to	 be	 an	 active	 citizen	 with	 rights	 and	 responsibilities	 in	 local	 and	 wider	 contexts; valuing	local	and	international	heritage;	having	awareness,	knowledge,	values,	skills	and	motivation	to live	 sustainably;	 taking	 action	 to	 promote	 his/her	 well-being	 and	 that	 of	 others.	 ‘‘Transformative pedagogy’’	offers	much	potential	in	this	changing	environment.

# 3.	‘‘Transformative	Pedagogy’’:	building	on	autonomous	teaching	and	learning

It	is	appropriate	that	we	briefly	examine	the	concept	of	autonomous	teaching	and	learning	before going	 on	 to	 examine	 the	 construct	 of	 ‘‘transformative	 pedagogy’’	 that	 builds	 on	 it.	 For	 Trim	 (1976, cited	in	Benson	and	Voller,	1997)	autonomous	learning	involves	‘an	adaptive	ability,	allowing	pupils	to develop	 supportive	 structures	 within	 themselves’.	 This	 implies	 that	 autonomy	 ‘should	 not	 be associated	only	with	external	organisational	structures’	but	 that	it	involves	 the	relation	between	 the learner	 and	 the	 content	 and	 process	 of	 learning	 (Gathercole,	 1990).	 Little	 (1991)	 has	 defined	 it	 as essentially	‘a	capacity	– for	detachment,	critical	reflection,	decision-making	and	independent	action’. This	 definition	 makes	 it	 clear	 that	 autonomous	 learning	 involves	 learners	 developing	 their metacognitive	 capacity	 that	 enables	 them	 to	 take	 control	 over	 the	 content	 and	 process	 of	 their learning.	Little	(1995,	p.	4)	has	argued	that	autonomous	learning	‘‘entails	that	the	learner	will	develop a	 particular	 kind	 of	 psychological	 relation	 to	 the	 process	 and	 content	 of	 learning’’.	 Kohonen	 has argued	that	autonomous	learning	involves:

willingness	and	ability	 to	make	 up	one’s	mind	about	what	is	 right	and	wrong,	independent	of external	 authority,	 but	 it	 does	 not	 mean	 individualism	 and	 a	 neglect	 of	 social	 context	 … Autonomy	thus	includes	the	notion	of	interdependence

(Kohonen,	2000).

In	 the	 NUIG	 study,	 the	 European	 Language	 Portfolio	 (ELP)	 was	 used	 to	 support	 autonomous teaching	and	learning.	This	artefact	was	conceived	by	the	Council	of	Europe	to	mediate	the	Common European	Framework	of	Reference	for	Languages:	Learning,	Teaching,	Assessment	(Council	of	Europe, 2005).	 It	 has	 two	 functions,	 a	 reporting	 function	 and	 a	 pedagogical	 function	 (Little,	 2002,	 p.182).	 It provides	 evidence	 of	 the	 learner’s	 language	 learning	 experience	 and	 proficiency	 level,	 as	 well	 their experience	 of	 language	 learning	 from	 both	 inside	 and	 outside	 formal	 learning	 contexts.	 Volunteer student-teachers	made	use	of	this	artefact	in	collaboration	with	mentors	during	the	‘practicum’.

‘‘Transformative	pedagogy’’	shares	important	aspects	with	other	design	frameworks,	such	as	critical pedagogy.	This	is	a	philosophy	of	education	that	emerged	from	a	legacy	of	radical	social	thought	and progressive	educational	movements	that	inspired	the	linking	of	schooling	to	democratic	principles	of society	and	to	transformative	social	action	in	the	interest	of	oppressed	communities	(Sen,	in	Darder	et al,	2008,	p.	3).	It	dates	back	to	Freire	(1970).	Giroux	and	others	understand	critical	pedagogy	as	a	form of	 praxis	 that	 supports	 the	 person	 in	 developing	 in-depth	 understanding	 of	 the	 world,	 and	 that enables	 the	 person	 to	 perceive	 contradictions	 between	 social	 and	 political	 realities.	 According	 to Mustakova-Possardt	 (2003),	‘critical	consciousness	also	includes	 taking	action	against	 the	oppressive elements	 in	 one’s	 life	 that	 are	 illuminated	 by	 that	 understanding’.	 Habermas	 (1972)	 argued	 that reason,	 in	 part	 through	 discourse	 ethics,	 has	 the	 potential	 to	 transform	 the	 world	 into	 a	 more	 just society.	‘‘Transformative	pedagogy’’	is	a	form	of	praxis.	It	has	a	moral	as	well	as	a	social	commitment to	bringing	about	personal	and	social	 transformations	by	making	connections	between	 teaching	and learning,	and	living.

The	 construct	 borrows	 from	 research	 in	 the	 context	 of	 collaborative	 teaching	 and	 learning	 (e.g. Vygotsky,	1978).	It	supports	participants	in	constructing	understandings	 through	dialogue,	peer-peer interaction,	 and	 collaboration	 among	 teachers	 in	 inquiring	 into	 their	 practice,	 and	 by	 way	 of	 more dynamic	alliances	between	school	and	society.	Dialogue	acts	as	the	dynamic	that	supports	participants in	developing	the	capacity	to	accept	responsibility	for	teaching	and	learning.

‘‘Transformative	pedagogy’’	is	supported	by	the	philosophy	of	pragmatism	in	which	the	function	of thought	is	to	guide	action,	and	truth	is	pre-eminently	tested	by	the	practical	consequences	of	belief. Shared	 moral-ethical	 values	 underpin	 any	 belief.	 Both	 ‘‘transformative	 pedagogy’’	 and	 pragmatism hold	 that	 teachers	 should	 support	 pupils	 in	 growing	 into	 better	 people.	 In	 addition,	 it	 draws	 on research	 about	 critical	 reflection,	 (e.g.	 Dewey,	 1938)	 in	 order	 that	 participants	 are	 supported	 in developing	 the	 capacity	 to	 stand	 back	 from	 their	 immediate	 experience,	 learn	 from	 it	 and,	 by implication,	 seek	 to	 bring	 about	 improvement.	 ‘‘Transformative	 pedagogy’’	 offers	 a	 conceptual framework for	how	relationships	between	persons	in	school	can	be	informed	by	moral-ethical	values that	support	personal,	professional	and	social	transformations.

A	distinction	is	drawn	between	the	‘‘banking’’	model	(Freire,	1970)	and	‘‘transformative	pedagogy’’. The	‘‘banking’’	model	proposes	that	teaching	can	be	organised	into	behavioural	and	other	outcomes that	are	measurable.	An	assumption	is	that	teaching	is	not	a	matter	of	professional	judgement	but	a matter	 of	 behaviours.	 Pupils	 are	 ‘the	 depositories	 and	 the	 teacher	 is	 the	 depositor’	 (Freire,	 1972,	 p. 58).	In	contrast,	Piaget	(1954)	distinguished	between	assimilative	processes	in	learning,	in	which	new experience	is	shaped	to	conform	to	existing	knowledge	structures,	and	accommodative	processes,	in which	the	knowledge	structures	change	in	response	to	new	experience.	At	the	heart	of	a	form	is	a	way of	 knowing	 (what	 Mezirow,	 2009,	 refers	 to	 as	 ‘frame	 of	 reference’).	 ‘‘Transformative	 pedagogy,’ involves	epistemological	change.

The	 concept	 of	 critical	 stance	 described	 by	 Cochran-Smith	 and	 Lytle	 (2009a)	 as	 a	 disposition towards	 oneself,	 others	 and	 the	 object	 of	 inquiry,	 is	 relevant	 here.	 ‘‘Transformative	 pedagogy’’ understands	 participants	 as	 persons	 in	 collaborative	 inquiry	 that	 makes	 links	 between	 teaching, learning	and	making	sense	of	the	world.	Therefore,	the	epistemological	beliefs	of	teacher	and	pupils about	knowledge	are	significant.	‘‘Transformative	pedagogy’’	has	social	and	ontological	implications.

Teachers	 are	 understood	 as critical	 inquirers	 who	 construct	 knowledge	 out	 of	 practice	 in conjunction	 with	 their	 colleagues.	 Teachers	 are	 advocates	 of	 improvement	 in	 classroom	 and	 school life,	 which	 is	 implied	 in	 the	 concept	 of	 ‘‘being-in-becoming’’.	 In	 addition,	 they	 are	 participants	 in school	 and	 society	 (‘‘beings-in-relation’’)	 who	 have	 a	 responsibility	 for	 self-directing	 and,	 by implication,	for	shaping	their	world.	‘‘Transformative	pedagogy’’	is,	therefore,	action	oriented.

# 4.	Knowledge	and	Knowing

Boyles	 (2006)	 makes	 the	 point	 that,	 for	 Dewey,	 there	 was	 a	 distinction	 between	 knowledge	 and knowing:	‘knowing	is	a	process	of	inquiry	(specific	instances	of	applying	oneself	to	solving	problems); knowledge	 constitutes	 the	 stable	 outcomes	 of	 inquiry’.	 For	 Kumaravadivelu	 (2012)	 there	 is,	 in addition,	a	distinction	to	be	made	between	professional,	procedural	and	personal	types	of	knowledge. The	 first	 type	 ‘‘represents	 the	 intellectual	 content	 of	 the	 discipline’’	 that	 in	 the	 context	 of	 language teaching	 relates	 to	 ‘‘the fundamental	 concepts	 of	 language,	 language	 learning,	 and	 language teaching’’	 (ibid.).	 Procedural	 knowledge	 is	 about	 ‘‘knowing	 how	 to	 manage	 classroom	 learning	 and teaching’’,	which	involves	not	only	establishing	and	sustaining	an	orderly	environment	but	also	aims ‘‘to	enhance	students	social	and	moral	growth’’	 (Everton	&	Weinstein,	2006).	Personal	knowledge	is ‘‘an	 offshoot	 of	 teachers’’	 reflection	 and	 reaction,	 insights	 and	 intuition’	 (Kumaravadivelu,	 2012). Shulman	(1987)	has	argued	that:

To	educate	is	to	teach	in	a	way	that	includes	an	account	of	why	you	do	as	you	do.	While	tacit knowledge	may	be	a	characteristic	of	many	things	that	teachers	do,	our	obligation	as	teacher educators	must	be	to	make	the	tacit	explicit

(Shulman,	1987).

Borg	(2009)	has	claimed	that	knowledge	and	beliefs	exert	a	strong	influence	on	human	action	and, by	 implication,	 therefore,	 on	 teaching.	 Habermas	 (1972)	 suggests	 that,	 since	 positivism	 holds	 that scientific	explanations	are	the	only	means	of	explaining	behaviour,	it	silences	the	debate	about	moral values	and	beliefs.	In	other	words,	positivism	‘‘fails	to	take	account	of	our	unique	ability	to	interpret our	 experiences	 and	 represent	 them	 to	 ourselves’’	 (Cohen	 et	 al.,	 2000).	 On	 the	 other	 hand,	 the interpretive	 perspective	 takes	 the	 view	 that	 the	 social	 world	 can	 only	 be	 understood	 from	 the perspective	of	those	who	are	part	of	the	ongoing	action.	This	view	is	supported	by	social	psychology.	It that	has	argued	that	because	of	man’s	‘‘self-awareness	and	powers	of	language’	he	must	be	seen	as different	from	any	other	creature	or	object’’	(Cohen	et	al.,	2000)	and	that	what	is	needed,	therefore,	is an	 anthropomorphic	 model	 of	 people.	 This	 particular	 approach	 entails	 taking	 account	 of	 uniquely human	attributes.	The	interpretive	paradigm,	 theory	emerges	as	meanings	 from	people	in	particular situations	 and	 yields	 insights	 and	 understandings	 of	 people’s	 behaviour	 (Cohen	 et	 al.,	 20003). ‘‘Transformative	pedagogy’’	is	situated	firmly	within	this	paradigm.

In	 the	 1900s	 Dewy	 was	 beginning	 work	 that	 was	 a	 reaction	 to	 the	 educational	 framework	 of memorisation.	He	sought	to	articulate	a	philosophy	of	community	to	explain	the	purpose	of	education in	 a	 democratic	 society,	 (e.g.	 to	 engage	 with	 and	 enlarged	 experience,	 thinking	 and	 reflection	 are central	 to	 teaching).	Students	must	 freely	interact	with	environments	in	 the	practice	of	constructing knowledge	(Dewey,	cited	in	Darder	et	al,	2008).	It	is	appropriate	at	this	stage	that	we	examine	the	key dimensions	that	make	up	‘‘transformative	pedagogy’’.

# 4.1.	Identity

Discourse	 of	 identity	 draws	 upon	 social	 interaction	 at	 school	 where	 identity	 is	 negotiated	 and constructed.	Public	discourse,	played	out	at	school	can	produce	negative	outcomes	for	children	from minority	backgrounds.	In	Ireland,	The	Education	Act	(1998)	states	that	students	should	experience	an education	that	‘respects	the	diversity	of	values,	beliefs,	languages	and	traditions’.	The	Equal	Status	Act (2000)	 and	 Equality	 Act	 (2004)	 promote	 equality	 of	 opportunity	 and	 prohibit discrimination.	 Is minority	as	well	as	majority	culture	represented	in	the	school	curriculum?	Lynch	and	Baker	think	not:

The	curricula,	syllabi,	and	modes	of	assessment	adopted	in	most	 formal	educational	systems are	 heavily	 based	 towards	 students	 with	 (written)	 linguistic	 and	 logical-mathematical capabilities

(Lynch & Baker,	2005).

Yet,	according	to	the	Department	of	Education	and	Science	(DES,	Dublin)	an	intercultural	approach is	 important	 within	 the	 curriculum	 as	 this	 helps	 pupils	 ‘‘to	 appreciate	 the	 richness	 of	 a	 diversity	 of cultures’’	(DES,	2002).

Intercultural	learning	‘focuses	on	the	language	user’s	personal	and	social	identities	and	abilities.	It emphasizes	 the	 student’s	 orientation	 to	 discourse	 as	 a	 language	 user relating	 meaningfully	 to	 other persons	 in	 different	 contexts	 (Kohonen,	 2006).	 Kaikkonen	 (2001,	 p.	 64)	 has	 argued	 that	 the	 ‘‘most important	 goal	 of	 foreign	 language	 education	 is	 to	 help	 pupils	 grow	 out	 of	 the	 shell	 of	 their	 mother tongue	 and	 their	 own	 culture’’.	 This	 implies	 that	 teaching	 should	 promote	 understanding	 of	 and respect	for,	cultural	diversity. Inter-culturalism	should	not	be	misconstrued	as	meaning	that	traditions, faiths,	and	cultures	and	the	attaching	symbols,	must	be	abolished	in	order	to	respect	cultural	diversity. Language	education	in	Ireland	needs	to	give	more	recognition	to	linguistic	and	cultural	diversity.	The

ELP	supports	pupils	in	reflecting	on	and	recording	any	linguistic	or	intercultural	experiences	they	have had.	It	supports	them	in	constructing	their	identity.

Teachers’	professional	identity	is	understood as	teacher-researcher	who	works, in	inquiry	communities	to	examine	their	own	assumptions,	develop	local	knowledge,	by	posing questions	 and	 gathering	 data,	 and	 work	 for	 social	 justice	 by	 using	 inquiry	 to	 ensure educational	opportunity,	access,	and	equity	for	all	students’

(Cochran-Smyth & Lytle,	1999b).

Teacher	 learning	 is	 ‘a	 site	 of	 struggle	 over	 activities,	 discourses,	 tools,	 and	 identity	 because	 of	 its situated	 nature	 within	 institutional,	 historical,	 and	 cultural	 contexts’	 (Singh	 and	 Richard,	 2006). ‘‘Transformative	 pedagogy’’	 is	 underpinned	 by	 values	 that	 sustain	 humanity	 (e.g.	 truthfulness, sincerity,	respect,	equality	and	social	justice).	Villegas	and	Lucas	(2007,	cited	in	Lucas,	2011)	present	a conception	 of	 linguistically	 responsive	 teachers that	 is	 relevant	 in	 this	 context.	 Qualities	 for	 this particular	conception	of	teacher	include,

socio-cultural	 consciousness,	 affirming	 views	 of	 diversity,	 commitment	 and	 skills	 for promoting	 change	 in	 schools,	 understanding	 of	 how	 learners	 construct	 knowledge,	 skills	 for learning	 about	 their	 students,	 and	 ability	 to	 use	 appropriate	 instructional	 approaches	 for diverse	students

(ibid.)

# 4.2.	Links	to	NUIG	study

According	 to	 several	 student-teachers,	 the	 ELP	 enhanced	 student-teachers’	 awareness	 that intercultural	 experiences	 (e.g.	 school	 exchange	 visits),	 were	 important	 aspects	 of	 language	 learning. Tutors	and	mentors	believed	that	developing	cultural	awareness	was	‘inextricably’	linked	to	language learning.

# 4.3.	Beliefs	and	Attitudes

Kalaja	 and	 Barcelos	 (2003)	 define	 beliefs	 as	 ‘‘opinions	 and	 ideas	 that	 pupils	 (and	 teachers)	 have about	 the	 task	 of	 learning...’’	 Pupils’	 self-awareness	 supports	 them	 in	 influencing	 their	 beliefs	 and attitudes.	 In	 the	 context	 of	 language	 learning,	 according	 to	 Mitchell	 and	 Myles	 (2004),	 ‘‘social psychologists	 have	 long	 been	 interested	 in	 the	 idea	 that	 attitudes	 of	 the	 pupil	 towards	 the	 target language,	its	speakers	and	the	learning	context,	may	all	play	some	part	in	explaining	success	or	lack	of it’’.	 Beliefs,	 according	 to	 Kohonen	 (2006),	 are	 ‘‘socially	 constituted,	 interactively	 sustained	 and	 timebound	 assumptions	 about the	 roles	 and	 duties	 of	 the	 participants’’.	 Clark	 and	 Peterson	 (1986)	 have argued	 that	 the	 process	 of	 teaching	 cannot	 be	 fully	 understood	 unless	 the	 domains	 of	 beliefs	 and action	are	brought	together	and	examined	in	relation	to	one	another.

Beliefs	 about	 and	 attitudes	 to	 teaching	 and	 learning	 can	 change.	 Attribution	 theory	 explains	 how people	 view	 the	 causes	 of	 their	 behaviour	 (Weiner,	 1992).	 Attributions	 are	 the	 perceived	 causes	 of outcomes	 and	 are	 important	 in	 motivation	 as	 they	 ‘‘influence	 beliefs,	 emotions and	 behaviours’’ (Schunk,	 2000).	 Dickinson	 (1995)	 has	 argued	 that	 the	 essential	 factor	 in	 sustaining	 motivation	 is ‘stability’	of	attributions	of	success	or	failure.

# 4.4.	Links	to	NUIG	study

In	Year	1	of	the	NUIG	study,	tutors	believed	that	growth	in	self-awareness	enabled	student-teachers to	 develop	 their	 professional	 identity,	 and	 to	 self-direct.	 In	 Year	 1,	 student-teachers	 found	 that dialogue	 supported	 them	 in	 developing	 the	 capacity	 to	 critically	 reflect	 on	 their	 practice.	 In	 Year	 2, tutors	believed	that	the	process	of	reflection	had	helped	student-teachers	to	develop	self-awareness. This	 suggests	 that	 the	 introduction	 of	 reflective	 learning	 had	 a	 positive	 impact	 on	 student-teachers’ epistemological	beliefs,	and	that	awareness	of	these	beliefs	had	supported	them	in	self-directing,	and in	 making	 use	 of	 the	 target	 language. Sharing	 self-evaluations	 of	 their	 teaching	 with	 other	 studentteachers	had	been	beneficial.	In	Year	2,	Pauline	and	Laura	believed	the	process	had	supported	them	in their	professional	learning).

In	 the	 context	 of	 how	 student-teachers	 promoted	 thinking	 in	 the	 target	 language	 among	 pupils, Supervisor	B	made	the	following	observation:

They	 did	 a	 lot	 of	 pair-work,	 group-work,	 and	 that	 is	 very	 worthwhile...would	 facilitate thinking	in	the	{target}	language

(Supervisor B).

Mentors	 in	 years	 1	 and	 2	 believed	 that	 self-assessment	 supported	 pupils	 in	 internalising	 learning, e.g.	in	Year	2,	use	of	simple	language	supported	pupils	in	self-assessing:

C’est	facile?	Moyen?	Assez	difficile?	Difficile?

(Mentor	Y).

Approximately $50 \%$ student-teachers	 involved	 pupils	 in	 making	 use	 of	 the	 target	 language	 as	 a medium	to	reflect	on	learning,	at	least	to	some	extent.	With	regard	to	pupils,	53	out	of	61	 first	year respondents $( 8 7 \% )$ ,	 and	 19	 out	 of	 27 $( 7 0 \% )$ Leaving	 Certificate	 respondents,	 indicated	 a	 positive response.	However,	only	8	out	of	47 $( 1 7 \% )$ second	years	responded	positively.	This	negative	response reflects	a	pattern	for	responses	from this	particular	group.		In	Year	2,	when	First	year	class	A	was	asked if	 the	 ELP	 had	 helped	 them	 to	 self-assess	 what	 they	 could	 do	 in	 the	 target	 language,	 14 $( 9 3 \% )$ indicated	 ‘yes’,	 and	 1	 pupil	 did	 not	 respond. In	 First	 year	 class	 B,	 17	 respondents $( 6 5 \% )$ indicated agreement.	 In	 Second	 year	 class	 C,	 17	 respondents $( 5 9 \% )$ indicated	 agreement.	 A	 similar	 pattern emerged	for	what	support,	the	ELP	offered	pupils	in	terms	of	thinking	about	their	learning.

Overall,	findings	suggest	that	use	of	the	target	language	in self-assessing	is	helpful	in	learning.

# 4.3.	Moral-Ethical	Values

Communities	 are	 associations	 in	 which	 individuals	 cooperate	 to	 realize	 shared	 aims…	 Ethics, ultimately,	is	about	the	shape	of	human	communities	in	which	people	can	flourish	and	about	the	basis for	social	cooperation	in	such	communities

(Strike,	2007).

Strike	highlights	the	importance	of	individuals	cooperating	for	the	common	good.	Nussbaum	argues that	 if	 a	 community	 is to	 ‘‘seek	 what	 is	 for	 the	 common	 good	 [it]	 must	 value	 reason	 and	 dialogue’’ (Nussbaum,	cited	in	Strike,	1997).	She	argues	that	reasoning/argument	is	an	‘essential	tool’	in	bringing about	 civic	 freedom	 because	 it	 enables	 the	 community	 to	 challenge	 beliefs	 and	 prejudices	 and	 to safeguard	the	common	good	against	the	selfish	interests	of	the	market	place.

The	 Teaching	 Council	 of	 Ireland’s	 Code	 of	 Professional	 Conduct	 for	 Teachers	 (2012)	 identifies standards	 of	 professionalism	 that	 are	 underpinned	 by	 four	 values:	 respect,	 care,	 integrity	 and	 trust. The	 above	 views	 suggest	 that	 pedagogy	 should	 be	 geared	 towards	 creating	 conditions	 that	 support participants	in	critically	examining	their	beliefs,	attitudes,	assumptions	and	actions	and	to	expose	any contradictions between	 beliefs	 and	 actions,	 between	 selfish	 interests	 and	 those	 that	 are	 for	 the common	good.	Underlying	ethics	are	the	principles	of	equality	and	democratic	citizenship.	This	implies that	 the	 culture	 of	 those	 who	 make	 up	 the	 school	 community	 must	 be	 respected	 in	 the curriculum (Strike,	2007).

The	connection	between	language,	schooling,	and	social	justice	has	special	significance	for	English language	 learners	 who	 are	 ‘‘often	 marginalized	 and	 underestimated’’	 (Lucas,	 2011).	 Clearly,	 it	 is important	 from	 a social	 justice	 perspective	 that	 mainstream	 teachers	 take	 their	 responsibility	 as English	language	teachers	seriously.	The	NUIG	study	did	not	address	this	particular	issue.

# 4.4.	Socio-Affective	Factors

The	 socio-affective	 domain	 is	 an	 important	 aspect	 in	 learning.	 ‘‘Affect	 refers	 to	 the	 emotion	 or feeling’’	 (Douglas,	 2000).	 Autonomous	 language	 use	 implies	 that	 pupils	 share	 their	 views,	 feelings, beliefs,	values,	attitudes	and	understandings	as	 they	interact	with	one	another,	including,	of	course, those	of	different	cultures	to	their	own.	Becoming	‘‘an	intercultural	language	user	clearly	emphasizes the	 central	 role	 of	 the	affective	 development	in	 foreign	and	 second	language	education’’	 (Kohonen, 2006).

Goal	 theory	 emphasises	 the	 active	 role	 pupils	 play	 in	 the	 cognitive	 process	 of	 learning,	 e.g.	 in making	 decisions,	 structuring,	 modifying	 and	 interpreting	 their	 experience	 (Meece,	 in	 Schunk	 and Zimmerman,	1994).	It	postulates	that	there	are	important	relationships	between	‘‘goals,	expectations, attributions,	 conceptions	 of	 ability,	 motivational	 orientations,	 social	 and	 self-comparisons	 and achievement’’	 (Schunk,	 2000).	 Feedback	 without	 learners’	 involvement	 in	 goal	 setting	 is ‘‘…meaningless,	 and	 without	 feedback,	 the	 person	 doesn’t	 have	 a	 clear	 assessment	 of	 progress’’ (Oxford	and	Shearin,	1996).

# 4.4.1	Links	to	NUIG	study

Involvement	in	making	decisions	had	a	motivating	effect,	and	promoted	willingness,	self-confidence and	 the	 development	 of	 the	 capacity	 to	 accept	 responsibility	 for	 teaching/learning.	 Self-awareness promoted	 motivation	 and	 willingness	 among	 student-teachers	 to	 accept	 responsibility	 for	 teaching. With	regard	to	pupils,	experiencing	language	learning	as	a	‘natural’	process	motivated	them	to	express their	meanings,	(e.g.	school	exchanges),	and	boosted	their	self-confidence.

Student-teachers	 found	 that	 negotiating	 with	 pupils	 about	 learning	 goals	 and	 topics,	 promoted motivation,	 self-confidence	in	language	learning.	Use	of	drawings	and	poster-making	promoted	 selfconfidence,	pride	and	self-esteem.

# 4.5.	Social	Interaction

Transformation	 of	 reality	 represents	 the	 starting	 point	 of	 man’s	 consciousness	 and	 understanding of	the	world.	‘‘Consciousness	of	dominant	cultural	discourse	and	of	its	limitations	is	a	prerequisite	in bringing	about	any	change	in	dominant	culture’’	 (Freire,	2008).	Social-cognitive	theories	suggest	that knowledge	 is	 constructed	 through	 social	 interaction	 (Bertrand,	 2003).	 For	 Freire	 (1972)	 dialogue implies	respect	and	working	with	each	other,	a	process	that	implies	social	conscience.	Interaction	and respect	imply,

space	 to	 each	 participant	 to	 contribute	 to	 the	 development	 of	 new	 knowledge,	 to	 develop their	own	voice,	to	make	their	own	offerings,	insights,	to	engage	in	their	own	action,	as	well	as to	create	their	own	products

(Barnett,	2000).

This	 suggests	 that	 teacher	 education	 programmes	 should	 have	 linguistic	 and	 cultural	 diversity	 as explicit	goals in	curriculum	and	instruction	in	order	to	support	the	development	of	academic	language proficiency	among	all	pupils	(De	Jong	and	Harper,	p.	76,	cited	in	Lucas,	2011).

Vygotsky	considered	the	social	environment	to	be	critical	for	learning.	A	key	concept	in	his	theory	is the	Zone	of	Proximal	Development.	This	is	defined	as:

The	 distance	 between	 actual	 development	 level	 as	 determined	 by	 independent	 problemsolving	and	the	level	of	potential	development	as	determined	through	problem	solving	under adult	guidance	or	in	collaboration	with	more	capable	peers	more capable	peers

(Vygotsky,	1978).

Vygotsky	 argued	 that	 pupils’	 cognitive	 functions,	 for	 example,	 problem	 solving,	 are	 internalised from	social	interactions	between	pupils	and teacher	and	between	pupils	‘of	varying	capabilities’	and that,	 by	 engaging	 in	 these	 interactions,	 pupils	 develop	 their	 own	 ‘‘lexicon’’	 that	 enables	 them	 ‘‘to direct,	control	and	plan	their	activities	during	problem-solving.	Finally,	pupils	internalize	this	as	inner speech,	developing	a	vocabulary	that	they	can	draw	on	to	direct	their	action’’	(Vygotsky,	in	Bershon, 1992,	 p.	 37).	 Another	 important	 contribution	 of	 Vygotsky	 is	 the	 notion	 of	 private	 speech.	 This mediates	 mental	 processes,	 e.g.	 problem	 solving, planning	 and	 evaluating	 (Lantolf,	 1994).	 Private speech,	 therefore,	 has	 cognitive,	 metacognitive	 and	 socio-affective	 functions	 (McCafferty,	 1994). Dialogue	supports	the	development	of	self-awareness	and	social-awareness.

Hargreaves	and	Fullan	(2012)	argue that	effective	leaders	of	the	future	will	be	those	who	are	able	to share	 responsibility,	 build	 positive	 relationships	 and	 offer	 teachers,	 parents	 and	 students	 an opportunity	to	work	together	to	improve	their	schools.	By	implication,	‘‘Transformative	pedagogy’’	is	a useful	construct	for	supporting	professional	leadership	as	well.

# 4.5.1.Links	to	NUIG	study

Collaboration	 among	 educators	 involved	 a	 process	 of	 dynamic	 interaction	 throughout	 the	 study. Educators	 supported	 student-teachers	 in	 a	 spirit	 of	 critical	 friendship.	 The	 notion	 of	 teacher-pupil interaction	supported	by	educators	included	student-teachers	learning	to	negotiate	with	pupils.	The goal	of	student-teachers’	dialogue	was	for	pupils	to	develop	the	capacity	to	accept	responsibility	for their	learning,	and	for	expressing	their	meanings	in	the	target	language.

At	 the	 end	 of	 Year	 1	 tutors	 believed	 their	 dialogue	 supported	 ‘self-awareness’	 among	 students (tutor	 B).	 At	 the	 end	 of	 Year	 2,	 tutors	 believed	 their	 relationship	 with	 student-teachers	 involved ‘‘partnership’’	 (tutor	 B),	 raising	 ‘‘awareness	 and	 consciousness,’’	 and	 helping	 them	 to	 develop	 their ‘‘unique	self’’	(tutor	B),	i.e.	their	identity.

From	 the	 student-teacher’s	 perspective,	 dialogue	 with	 tutors	 in	 Year	 1	 was	 helpful.	 Dialogue prompted	them	to	reflect	on	how	to	improve	teaching.

Evidence	suggests	that	mentors	collaborated	with	student-teachers	more	in	year	2.	Pauline	had	‘‘a lot	of	freedom’’.	Elizabeth	was	given	‘‘a	lot	of	responsibility’’.	and	the	mentor’s	advice	had	helped	her. Clearly,	there	are	benefits	to	be	derived	from	more	systematic	mentoring	that	is	informed	by	respect.

In	Year	1,	most	student-teachers	found	that	pair-work	supported	pupils	in	accepting	responsibility for	expressing	their	meanings.	Pedagogical	dialogue	made	learning	more	appealing,	e.g.	‘‘it	help{ed} pupils	to	build	on	previous	knowledge’’,	and	promoted	self-confidence.	‘‘They	are	more	confident	as a	group’.	In	Year	2,	all	student-teachers	 found	 that	dialogue	with	pupils	promoted	learning.	Pauline ‘‘shared	 responsibility’’,	 and	 found	 it	 promoted	 mutual	 equality	 and	 respect.	 Laura	 found	 dialogue promoted	 more	 active	 involvement,	 and	 Elizabeth,	 that	 it	 made	 learning	 ‘‘more	 manageable’’	 and ‘‘relevant’’.

# 4.6.	Communicating	(in	the	target	language)

Since	the	goal	of	language	learning	is	for	pupils	to	be	able	to	express	their	meanings,	it	is	logical	that pupils	 should	 learn	 to	 think	 in	 the	 target	 language.	 Cohen	 (1998)	 has	 argued	 that	 the	 choice	 of language	of	thought	‘may	have	significant	implications	for	ultimate	success	at	learning,	using	as	well	as forgetting	a	language’.	Kern	(1994)	suggests	there	are	several	disadvantages	of	making	use	of	L1	in	the context	of	a	reading	task,	(e.g.	inaccuracies	and	miscomprehension	and	word	for	word	translation	may not	lead	to	integration	of	meaning).	However,	Macaro	(2001)	suggests	that	L1	use	could	offer	several advantages,	(e.g.	for	semantic	processing,	storage	of	lexical	items	and	for	some	aspects	of	syntax).

# 4.6.1.	Links	to	NUIG	study

Target	 language	 use	 by	 student-teachers	 that	 included	 everyday	 routines	 supported	 target language	proficiency	development.	Data	from	representative	examples	of	what	student-teachers	said are	offered here. In	year	1,	Brian	found	that	use	of	the	target	language	meant	pupils	were	‘much	more active,	 more	 participative’.	 In	 the	 context	 of	 a	 project,	 Jacinta	 involved	 pupils	 in	 pair-work	 ‘‘It	 allows for	 more	 expressive	 answers	 since	 they	 are	 not	 subjected	 to	 an	 exam	 situation	 where	 each	 student works	individually’’.

While	the	mother	tongue	was	used	when	necessary	by	Michelle,	she	acknowledged	that	‘you	can’t teach	a	language	through	the	medium	of	a	mother	tongue’.	Mime,	gesture	and	repetition	were	ways by	 which	 teachers	 could	 express	 their	 meanings.	 Tutors	 were	 satisfied	 with	 the	 increased	 level	 of target	 language	 use,	 (e.g.	 a	 ‘vast	 improvement	 from	 the	 beginning	 to	 the	 end’	 (Tutor	 B),	 ‘the	 major change’	(Tutor	C).

In	year	2, Elizabeth	believed	that	‘by	making	use	of	the	target	language	pupils	‘were	learning	with it’.	She	supported	pupils	in	expressing	themselves.	Role-play	supported	pupils	in	this.	Pupils	made	use of	 the	 Dossier	 that	 was	 ‘directly	 connected	 to	 the	 ELP’,	 (e.g.	 describing	 their	 family).	 This	 made learning	more	relevant	to	pupils.	They	decided	what	to	say,	and	she	helped	them.

Laura	found	that	by	involving	pupils	in	designing	menus	in	the	context	of	a	project,	promoted	more ‘practical	and	personal	and	meaningful’	learning.	Pauline	organised	pen-pals	for	her	pupils.	She	helped them	 to	 write	 their	 ideas:	 ‘they	 are	 doing	 the	 work	 on	 their	 own’!	 This	 is	 an	 example	 of	 how	 she supported	 pupils	 in	 accepting	 responsibility	 for	 expressing	 their	 meanings	 and	 in	 developing intercultural	awareness.	Making	use	of	the	target	language	in	everyday	routines	also	supported	pupils in	developing	target	language	proficiency.

# 4.7.	(Meta) cognition

Cognition	 in	 teacher	 education	 concerns	 what	 teachers	 think,	 know	 and	 believe	 (Borg,	 2009) Metacognitive	knowledge	is	‘‘a	rich	knowledge	base’’	(Wenden,	1995)	that	is	‘‘the	stable,	stable	and sometimes	 fallible,	 knowledge,	 pupils	 acquire	 about	 themselves	 as	 pupils	 and	 about	 the	 learning process’’	 (ibid.).	 Teachers	 need	 to	 be	 able analyze	 learners’	 needs	 (Kumaravadivelu,	 2012)	 and	 to support	 them	 in	 being	 more	 autonomous	 learners.	 In	 language	 learning	 this	 implies	 that	 teachers should	 create	 conditions	 that	 support	 pupils	 in	 developing	 the	 capacity	 to	 make	 use	 of	 the	 target language	in	order	to	express	their	meanings.

The	 concept	 of	 reflective	 practice	 has	 had	 a	 strong	 influence	 on	 teacher	 education.	 For	 Dewey, reflection	 begins	 when	 teachers	 experience	 ‘‘a	 difficulty,	 troublesome	 event,	 or	 experience	 that cannot	 be	 immediately resolved’’	 (Zeichner	 & Liston,	 1996).	 Reflective	 action	 is	 that	 which	 involves ‘‘active,	 persistent,	 and	 careful	 consideration	 of	 any	 belief	 or	 practice	 in	 light	 of	 the	 reasons	 that support	 it	 and	 the	 further	 consequences	 to	 which	 it	 leads’’	 (ibid.).	 ‘‘To reflect	 is	 to	 look	 back	 over what	 has	 been	 done	 so	 as	 to	 extract	 the	 net	 meanings	 which	 are	 the	 capital	 stock	 for	 intelligent dealing	 with	 further	 experiences’’	 (Dewey,	 1938).	 Zeichner	 and	 Liston	 (1996)	 believe	 the	 reflective teacher	is	in	a	position	to	recognize	‘‘that	a	central	source	of	his	or	her	teaching	practice	is	his	or	her practical	 theories’’	 in	 addition	 to	 the	 context	 in	 which	 he	 or	 she	 works.	 Schön	 (1983)	 understood reflection	 as	 a	 recursive	 process	 that	 enables	 the	 teacher	 to	 reconstruct	 experience	 through reflection. Furlong	 and	 Maynard	 (1995)	 suggest	 that	 content	 knowledge	 is	 built	 up	 through	 the process	 of	 pedagogical	 reasoning	 - through	 planning,	 teaching,	 adapting	 and	 reflecting.	 Brookfield (1987)	believes	that	identifying	and	considering	critically	the	assumptions	that	underlie	our	practice	is difficult.	Challenging	the	validity	of	these	assumptions	is	even	‘‘more	disturbing,	for	in	doing	this	we call	into	question	beliefs	and	rules	that	have	governed	much	of	our	lives’’.	Gadotti	(1996)	writes	that, in	pedagogy	the	practice	is	the	horizon,	the	aim	of	the	theory.	Therefore,	the	educationalist lives	the	instigating	dialectic	between	his	or	her	daily	life	- the	lived school	and	the	projected school	- which	attempts	to	inspire	a	new	school

Gadotti	(1996).

Flores	(2001)	has	suggested	that	there	is	a	relationship	between	teachers’	stated	beliefs	and	their practice.	 In	 a	 study	 conducted	 by	 Manguhbai	 et	 al	 (2004)	 it	 was	 found	 that	 having	 a	 sophisticated practical	 theory	impacted	on	 teaching,	and	Pollard	 (2005,	p.94)	has	argued	 that	‘reflective	 teachers need	to	consider	their	own	values	carefully	and	be	aware	of	any	implications’.

(Meta) cognition	 and	 self-awareness	 are	 essential	 in	 order	 that	 participants	 can	 accept responsibility	for	transforming	their	thinking	and	by	implication,	their	teaching.

# 4.7.1.	Links	to	NUIG	study

Student-teachers	 were	 involved	 in	 critical	 reflective	 writing,	 (e.g.	 lesson	 evaluations,	 reflective essays).	A	majority,	nine	student-teachers,	believed	that	periodical	reflective	writing	had	been	a	useful tool.	For	example,	Brian	found	that:

reflecting	helpful	because	it	brings	up	certain	issues	that	I	can	articulate, and	just	bring	it	to	the	level	of	conscious[ness]

(Brian).

This	aspect	was	not	examined	in	the	NUIG	study.

# 4.8.	School	and	Society

I	agree	Boylan	&	Woolsey	who	have	suggested	 that	 teacher	education	needs	to	create	conditions that	support	student-teachers	in	examining	the	relationship	between	identity	as	language	teacher	and ‘‘engaging	 in	 social	 justice’’	 (Boylan	 &	 Woolsey,	 2014).	 	 This	 suggests	 that	 any	 knowledge	 that	 is constructed	 through	 teaching	 and	 learning	 should	 be	 underpinned	 by	 moral-ethical	 values	 of truthfulness,	sincerity,	respect,	equality	and	social	justice.	Growth	in	student-teachers’	self-and	socialawareness	are	supported	by	their	dialogue	with	educators.	Social	justice	encompasses	a	‘‘distributive and	 relational	 perspective’’	 (Cochran-Smith	 and	 Lytle,	 2009c)	 as	 well	 as	 a	 participative	 dimension (Fraser,	 2008).	 Distributive	 points	 to	 equal	 access	 to	 educational	 goods	 and	 outcomes,	 and participative	is	concerned	with	the	capacity	and	opportunity	to	participate	in	decision	making	(ibid.).	I agree	 with	 North	 (2008)	 when	 he	 argues	 that	 attention	 must	 be	 given	 not	 only	 to	 the	 social	 and organizational,	but	also	to	the	personal,	as	social	justice	issues	are	enacted	in	‘embodied	relationships’ (Boylan	 & Woolsey,	 2014).	 ‘‘Transformative	 pedagogy’’	 supports	 more	 equitable	 and	 democratic relationships	in	teaching	and	learning,	in	‘being-in-relation’	in	the	school	and	in	the	world.

The	 Code	 of	 Conduct	 (The	 Teaching	 Council	 of	 Ireland,	 2012)	 acknowledges	 the	 wider	 context	 in which	teaching	takes	place,	and	the	many	factors	beyond	teachers’	control	but	which	have	a	bearing on	their	work,	including:	engagement	of	parents	and	the	wider	community.	The	new	junior	cycle	lists eight	key	principles:	quality,	creativity	and	innovation,	engagement	and	participation,	continuity	and development,	 wellbeing,	 choice	 and	 flexibility,	 inclusive	 education,	 and	 learning	 to	 learn	 (A

Framework	 for	 Junior	Cycle,	DES,	2012).	In	addition,	it	identifies	 the	importance	of	appreciating	and respecting	diverse	values,	beliefs,	and	traditions;	what	it	means	to	be	an	active	citizen	with	rights	and responsibilities	in	local	and	wider	contexts.

Byram	has	argued	that

Language	 teaching	 with	 an	 intercultural	 dimension	 continues	 to	 help	 learners	 acquire linguistic	 competence…But	 it	 also	 develops	 intercultural	 competence,	 i.e.	 their	 ability	 to ensure	a	shared	understanding	by	people	of	different	social	identitites

(Byram	et	al.,	2002).

According	 to	 Hall,	 the	 particular	 cultural	 identity	 comes	 about	 as	 a	 result	 of	 ‘where	 and	 how	 one positions	oneself	in	some	ever-expanding	relational	network’	(Hall,	1992).

Key	 values	 that	 are	 understood	 to	 sustain	 humanity,	 support	 values	 in	 the	 new	 junior	 cycle programme.	 ‘‘Transformative	 pedagogy’’	 offers	 a	 framework	 that	 supports	 more	 systematic	 and sustainable	links	between	school	and	society	and	by	implication,	supports	participants	in	developing their	understanding	about	what	‘‘being-in-relation’’	and	‘‘being-in-becoming’’	mean	in	the	context	of school	and	the	wider	world.

# 5.	Conclusion

‘‘Transformative	pedagogy’’	has	philosophical,	psychological	and	 social	underpinnings.	It	offers	a framework	 that	 supports	 (student-) teachers	 in	 developing	 their	 professional	 identity	 linked	 to teacher-researcher.	We	have	referenced	key	dimensions	of	the	construct,	where	possible,	to	a	recent NUIG	 study	 about	 autonomous	 teaching	 and	 learning	 that	 made	 use	 of the	 ELP.	 ‘‘Transformative pedagogy’’	shares	important	aspects	with	autonomous	teaching	and	learning,	and	other	models,	but in	its	totality,	it	offers	an	original,	‘‘transformative’’,	educational	framework	that	links	classroom	and school	teaching	and	learning	with	living	in	wider	society.	The	construct	supports	teacher	and	pupils	as persons	in	developing	critical	awareness,	informed	by	moral-ethical	values,	and	linked	to	the	capacity to	 self-direct,	 to	 accept	 responsibility	 for	 shaping	 teaching	 and	 learning,	 and	 for	 shaping	 their understanding	 about	 what	 being	 in	 the	 world	 means.	 It	 supports	 persons	 in	 ‘‘being-in-relation’’	 as well	as	‘‘being-in-becoming’’.

Values	 of	 respect,	 care,	 integrity,	 and	 trust	 underpin	 the	 Code	 of	 Professional	 Conduct	 (The Teaching Council	 of	 Ireland).	 In	 addition,	 Statements	 in	 the	 new	 junior	 cycle	 highlight	 key	 values	 of appreciating	 and	 respecting	 diverse	 values,	 beliefs,	 and	 traditions,	 what	 it	 means	 to	 be	 an	 active citizen	 with	 rights	 and	 responsibilities	 in	 local	 and	 wider	 contexts,	 valuing	 local	 and	 international heritage,	 having	 awareness,	 knowledge,	 values,	 skills,	 and	 motivation	 to	 live	 sustainably,	 as	 well	 as taking	 action	 to	 promote	 well-being.	 ‘‘Transformative	 pedagogy’’	 offers	 a	 model	 that	 supports	 the attainment	 of	 these	 values	 and	 statements.	 What	 Pope	 John	 Paul	 II	 said	 is	 appropriate:	 ‘‘To	 teach means	not	only	 to	impart	what	we	know,	but	also	 to	reveal	who	we	are	by	living	what	we	believe’’ (September	12,	1984).
