# a b s t r a c t

Lexical bundles have been found to be of considerable significance in academic texts. EAP instructors and students alike are thus encouraged to pay careful attention to these multiword units in their teaching and learning process, respectively. There are several reports as to the discipline sensitivity of lexical bundles, but their variations within the same discipline are underexplored. This paper investigated the forms and functions of 4-word bundles in a 5.7 million word corpus of textbooks, research articles and theses in the discipline of applied linguistics to shed new light on their intradisciplinary variations across the three genres. Our analyses revealed that while bundles vary substantially across different genres in the same discipline, there are still significant commonalities that disciplinary genres share. Our findings are theoretically insightful as they challenge the generality-specificity dichotomy in EAP by showing that neither side can override the other in its importance. The results also have pedagogical implications for EAP practitioners by drawing their attention to the significance of both discipline and genre in teaching lexical bundles.

# 1. Introduction

The formulaic nature of language has attracted increasing attention during the past two decades as single words have been found to belong to larger lexical units whose meanings, frequencies, and uses are not necessarily similar to their individual constituents (Howarth, 1998; Shirazizadeh, 2014). Such clusters or lexical bundles (LBs), as they are commonly called in the literature of English for academic purposes (EAP), “are words which follow each other more frequently than expected by chance, helping to shape text meanings and contributing to our sense of distinctiveness in a register” (Hyland, 2008a, p. 5). They are ubiquitous in different genres and make up a remarkable part of all stretches of discourse (Biber, 2006; Biber et al., 1999). Adequate and appropriate use of such bundles is therefore not only an indicator of language proficiency (Wei & Lei, 2011) but also a sign of writing expertise and discourse community membership (Salazar, 2014). Much like individual words, LBs vary across genres (Biber, 2006), disciplines (Hyland, 2008a) and writers’ L1 (Lu & Deng, 2019; Shin, 2019). Their variation is of more significance in EAP context which is premised on the idea that any particular domain of academic discourse is associated with, or even restricted to, particular linguistic features, and successful EAP courses are the ones designed based on the specific needs and discourse practices of the target groups. Numerous studies have confirmed that the frequency, function and form of LBs vary across the texts of different university disciplines. There are however fewer reports on intradisciplinary variation of LBs which can be found not only across different genres (e.g. research articles, progress reports, dissertations) but also across the different parts (e.g. abstract, introduction, method) of the same genre (Saadatakhah, 2018).

Examining the possible variation of LBs within the same discipline is of significance as it contributes to our knowledge of the understudied area of intradisciplinary linguistic variation. Territories of academic English can be mapped with regard to how LBs are employed within and without the assumed (sub)disciplinary borders. This may shed light on the generalityspecificity dichotomy in English for specific and academic purposes by giving clues as to how far we should go in either direction (Hyland, 2002). To further elucidate the intradisplinary variation of LBs in academic texts, this study compares the frequency, form, and function of LBs in the three established genres of theses,1 articles and textbooks in the field of applied linguistics. We focused on these three genres as they constitute established publication types in all disciplines. As we had to limit our investigation to one discipline, we chose applied linguistics as it is an interdisciplinary field of study which represents a wide landscape of academic territories.

# 2.1. Lexical bundles and their significance

Rooted in corpus-informed views of language and their emphasis on lexicalized, idiomatic, and memory-based language acquisition and use (Pawley & Syder, 1983; Sinclair, 1991), LBs are defined as extended collocations or combinations of three or more words that appear more repeatedly than expected by chance (Biber et al., 1999). While Altenberg (1993) was a pioneer in creating a clear-cut methodology for the identification of LBs, there have been, ever since, many studies investigating the different aspects of bundle use by various users and in different contexts. The body of research into this domain shows that formulaic sequences are significant on both psycholinguistic and socio-functional grounds. There is some evidence that many LBs are stored as holistic chunks and enjoy processing advantage over non-formulaic sequences (Nekrasova, 2009; Schmitt et al., 2004). In a study that employed self-paced reading task, Tremblay et al. (2011) showed that LBs and sentences containing LBs were read faster by the participants than the control sentence fragments, supporting that formulaic sequences are stored as single processing units. In another study, Jeong and Jiang (2019) employed a rigorous design and reported that only the structurally complete LBs were more quickly processed. They concluded that for faster processing, an LB should be not only highly frequent but also structurally complete.

The socio-functional significance of LBs lies in that they can act, like many other linguistic features, as markers of discourse community membership as people belonging to the same community have similar preferred ways of saying and writing ideas which can be well reflected in their employment of LBs (Wray, 2013). Such preferences are not only means of expressing solidarity with fellow members of the community (Cortes, 2006) but also indicators of credible communal voices (Pang, 2010). Such shared ways of using language usually go beyond simple preferences and act as implicit gate-keeping standards which, if not conformed to, may lead to marginalization and exclusion. Many studies have shown that the use of LBs follow specific registrial (Biber et al., 2004) and disciplinary (Cortes, 2004) norms. Breeze (2013), for example, showed that legislations which included companies acts employed a large proportion of specialized LBs. Similar ways of employing LBs have also been reported in a wide range of discourses such as mathematics classroom discourse (Herbel-Eisenmann et al., 2010), pharmaceutical discourse (Grabowski, 2015), hotel websites (Fuster-Marquez, 2014  ), and marine accident investigation reports (Jhang et al., 2018).

# 2.2. Lexical bundles and their variation

While the use of bundles is generally associated with a more idiomatic and natural use of language, there is a large body of research on the variation of LBs across different communicative events (Howarth, 1998; Meunier & Granger, 2008). In one of the earliest studies on registerial variation of LBs, Biber et al. (1999) reported that the frequency and form of LBs varied between conversation and academic prose with conversation making higher use of such prefabricated sequences. In a followup study, Biber et al. (2004) showed that the classroom teaching register employed a larger number of bundles than textbooks as well as daily conversation and academic prose. Significant variations in the forms and functions of the bundles across these four registers were also reported.

The other source of variation in the use of LBs that has been investigated so far is writers’ L1. Differences between native and non-native writers in using LBs have been reported to exist in a wide range of academic texts from the essays of first-year university students (Shin, 2018) to the abstracts of doctoral dissertations (Lu & Deng, 2019). For instance, Chen and Baker (2010) compared English essays written by L1 English and L1 Chinese students and found that native writers used LBs both more frequently and more variously. Examining the English research papers of telecommunications, Pan et al. (2016) reported that L1 Chinese writers used a higher number of bundles than did native authors. Considerable structural and functional differences were also found between the two groups. Pan and Liu (2019) also showed that L2 academic writers used more bundles than L1 English writers did. Esfandiari and Barbary (2017), however, examined psychology articles written by L1 Persian and L1 English authors and reported that the numbers of total bundles and VP-based bundles were larger in the native authors’ texts.

Writers’ competence or expertise in writing is also reported to influence the use of LBs. Wei and Lei (2011) compared PhD dissertations with published articles in the field of applied linguistics and found that Chinese doctoral students used more types and tokens of LBs than did published professional authors. Doctoral dissertations were also found to include more passive structures, and fewer anticipatory it structures and participant-oriented bundles. These findings, however, contradicted those of Chen and Baker (2010) who analyzing multidisciplinary corpora, found that published academic writing included a wider range of LBs than both L1 and L2 student academic writing. Similarly, Pan and Liu (2019) found that the frequency of LBs used in published articles of applied linguistics, which represented expert writers, were lower than that in MA theses across both native and non-native writer groups. They also reported that published articles included more clausal and less phrasal bundles than MA theses. As to the functions of bundles, both research articles and MA theses used the largest proportion of text-oriented bundles and the lowest proportion of stance bundles.

LBs have also been reported to vary across disciplines. Cortes (2004) compared history and biology and found that while the former employed only noun and prepositional phrases, the latter made use of a wide range of bundle structures. Another important difference between these two disciplines was the higher frequency of bundles with a hedging and mitigating function in biology texts. Hyland (2008a) also examined the use of LBs in four university disciplines and showed that the texts of electrical engineering used the highest number of bundles with business, applied linguistics, and biology following it. While electrical engineering and biology used a wide range of passive bundles, the two soft knowledge fields used more prepositional bundles. In terms of function, while the two hard science fields used more research-oriented bundles, business and applied linguistics made wider use of text-oriented and stance bundles. More recently, Reppen and Olson (2020) compared nine disciplines and reported that $8 4 \%$ of all the extracted bundles appeared only in one or two of the nine disciplines; there were only nine bundles that were shared by all the nine disciplines. Functional examination of the bundles revealed that those bundles which appeared in various disciplines usually functioned as discourse frames and textual signposts, while the others were usually content specific. Cross-disciplinary variation patterns in the frequency, form, and function of bundles were also reported by Nekrasova-Beker and Becker (2020) who compared five different engineering disciplines.

As briefly reviewed above, the majority of the studies have focused on distinctions and differences in the use of bundles, leaving the possible commonalities in their use by different writer groups or disciplines underexplored. Moreover, most of these studies have either compared several disciplines or investigated cross-generic differences in corpora that included texts from various fields of study with only a handful of them controlling text discipline and doing an intradisciplinary investigation (e.g. Pan & Liu, 2019). Against this background, we aim at examining how differently LBs are employed by different genres within the same discipline while not shutting our eyes to the possible intergeneric similarities of their use. More specifically, this study is guided by the following research questions:

1. How similar and different are the bundles used in the three genres of textbooks, articles, and theses of applied linguistics?   
2. How do the structure and function of LBs vary across textbooks, articles, and theses of applied linguistics?

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Corpus

Our data included an electronic corpus of written texts made up of a) journal articles, b) textbooks, and c) theses and dissertations in the discipline of applied linguistics. The research article subcorpus consisted of 173 papers published in 10 leading international journals (see Appendix A). The textbook section of our corpus comprised thirty textbooks published by well-known academic publishers (see Appendix B). The theses subcorpus included 25 master’s theses and $2 5 ~ \mathrm { P h D }$ dissertations at American, Canadian and British universities (see Appendix C). All the articles, textbooks, and theses were written between 2010 and 2019. To compile the corpus, we used whole texts and removed author and publication information, table of contents, acknowledgement and dedications, tables, figures, footnotes, endnotes, references, and appendices. As an interdisciplinary field, applied linguistics covers a wide range of areas of study. To have a representative corpus, at the initial stage of corpus compilation, we prepared a list of contents and asked two experts to check all the topics. The list was then modified based on their comments by replacing over-represented topics with underrepresented ones.2 Table 1 shows the specifications of our corpora.

a Standardized type/token ratio was calculated based on every 1000 words of the corpora.

# 3.2. Lexical bundle identification

In this study, we focused just on four-word bundles “because they are far more common than 5-word strings and offer a clearer range of structures and functions than 3-word bundles (Hyland, 2008a, p.8). Whereas shorter strings are often contained within four-word bundles, longer ones are comparatively infrequent (Breeze, 2013; Cortes, 2004). Frequency and breadth of use are two key features for the selection of bundles. There is however little consensus as to their appropriate cutoffs. We followed Hyland (2008a) criteria by selecting the LBs that occurred with a minimum frequency of 20 per million words and appeared in at least $1 0 \%$ of the texts. WordSmith 5 (Scott, 2008) was used to generate a list of the bundles in each of the three genres; those which met our criteria were kept and the rest were discarded. The remaining bundles were then structurally and functionally classified. Biber et al. (1999) taxonomy was employed for structural categorization. It assigns LBs to eight major categories based on their grammatical types. These categories include a) noun phrase of, b) other noun phrases, c) prepositional phrase $^ +$ of, d) other prepositional phrases, e) passive $^ +$ prepositional phrase, f) anticipatory it $^ +$ verb/adjective, g) beþnoun/adjective phrase, and h)others. Table 5 provides an example for each category.

As for functional classification, we used Hyland’s (2008a) taxonomy as a modified and updated version of earlier taxonomies (Biber, 2006; Cortes, 2004) that better suits written academic corpora. It is comprised of three major subcategories of research-oriented, text-oriented and participant-oriented functions. Research-oriented bundles which include five different subcategories help writers elaborate on their research activities and their experiences of the real world. Text-oriented bundles with four subtypes are used by writers to organize their ideas, frame their meanings and signpost their texts. Participant-oriented bundles which are divided into stance and engagement features are used to directly address the readers or express writer’s attitudes. Table 2 illustrates the functional classification with examples. The selected LBs were assigned to the functional (sub)categories based on their general meaning and purpose as examined in their context of use via concordance lines.

# 4. Results and discussion

The primary analysis of the data showed that there were a total of 167 different LBs meeting the selection criteria in our whole 5.7 million word corpus. The number of individual 4-word LBs was 27456 which comprised $1 . 9 1 \%$ of the total number of words. The five most frequent bundles which occurred more than 80 times per million words and made up $1 0 . 8 \%$ of all the bundles used in the corpus were on the other hand, at the same time, on the basis of, the extent to which, and at the end of. Table 4 shows the 50 most frequent LBs in the three genres. Our analysis of the top 20 bundles also showed that they comprised $3 1 . 3 \%$ of all the bundles and $0 . 6 \%$ of the total words. Theses included the largest number of different bundles and the highest percentage of total words in bundles. Textbooks, on the other hand, employed the fewest bundles and had the lowest proportion of its total words in bundles. Table 3 summarizes this frequency information.

To have an overall view of the commonalities and variations in the use of bundles across the three genres, we counted the bundles which were shared by two or all the three genres as well as the ones which were particular only to one genre. As illustrated in Fig. 1, there were 46 bundles which appeared across all the three genres, comprising $2 0 \%$ , $3 1 \%$ , and $4 0 \%$ of the bundles used in theses, articles, and textbooks respectively. Also, the number of bundles exclusively used in the theses, articles, and textbooks were 113 $( 4 8 \% ) .$ , 40 $( 2 7 \% )$ , and 43 $( 3 7 \% )$ respectively. In fact, whereas almost half of the bundles used by master’s and PhD students in their theses were not found in articles and textbooks, $4 0 \%$ of the bundles in textbooks were found in both of the other two genres. The higher distinctiveness of theses in using LBs can be attributed to the lower written language competence (Chen & Baker, 2014; Staple et al., 2013; Wei & Lei, 2011) or limited familiarity of their writers with the highly conventionalized and genre-sensitive use of language in the academic texts of their field (Cortes, 2004). The lower distinctiveness of articles, on the other hand, in using common LBs can be reflective of the rigidly conventionalized language of this genre that is a result of, among other things, the peer review process. Besides, published articles are usually written by or under the strict supervision of scholars with significant familiarity with the particularities of academic discourse of their discipline. The large proportion of the common bundles in the textbooks shows that they make wider use of general academic English as they are intended for a more general readership like students, compared to theses and articles which have a comparatively limited professional audience like academics. While theses were found to include the largest proportion of LBs, textbooks were the least formulaic genre. The higher employment of bundles by thesis writers can be due to their lower writing competence as Hyland (2008b) also found that theses and dissertations included more LBs than did articles. This is in line with lexicalized views of language which consider the process of acquisition as moving from memory-based chunks to rule-based creative phrases (Pawley & Syder, 1983; Skehan, 1998). In such a view, thesis writers are at their early stages of learning academic writing and may therefore resort more frequently to formulas.

We also found that textbooks were less formulaic than articles as LBs constituted a lower proportion of the total number of words in this genre (Table 3). Textbooks, unlike articles, do not follow strict frameworks for the organization of their content and do not necessarily share the same sections (e.g. participants, instruments, data analysis, etc.). They are also not bound to word counts. Such differences give book authors relatively greater freedom with the structure and content of their texts which may allow them to use language in a more creative, hence less formulaic, manner.

Our pairwise comparisons revealed that theses and articles shared 56 bundles which is equal to $23 \%$ of the bundles in the theses subcorpus and $3 8 \%$ of the bundles in the articles. Textbooks and articles shared only six bundles which comprised $4 \%$ of all the bundles in the articles and $5 \%$ of the bundles in textbooks. Theses and textbooks shared 20 bundles that amount to $8 . 5 \%$ of all the bundles in the theses and $1 7 \%$ in the textbooks subcorpus. In sum, of the three genres we investigated, theses and articles, and textbooks and articles had the largest and smallest degree of overlap respectively. The similarity between theses and articles is unexpected as there are clear differences between their writers in terms of writing and subject matter expertise. However, the fact that both of these genres report on a research project and include similar sections might have overshadowed the existing differences in the expertise of the writers. This is, in other words, the overpowering of writers’ expertise by the requirements of genre. Interestingly, the minimal overlap between articles and textbooks was almost limited to those bundles which were common among all the three genres. This can be speculatively attributed to the explanatory, review-based, and instructional content of the textbooks which is easily distinguished from the report-based, concise, and word-limit bound rhetoric of articles. That textbooks shared more with theses than articles can also be justified in view of this fact that unlike articles which are packed and concise, theses are extended research reports usually with long introduction and literature review chapters that make them rather similar to textbooks in terms of content and language.

# 4.1. Structure of bundles

Our investigations of the main structures of the LBs showed that, overall, noun phrase and prepositional bundles made up more than $7 5 \%$ of all the bundles used in our corpus. As Table 5 shows, the top two structures prepositional phrase of and noun phrase of comprised 25 and $2 3 . 9 \%$ of the bundle types in our whole corpus respectively. Examination of prepositional phrases showed that they were often used to make connections between authors’ propositional arguments or parts of the text (1, 2), or to refer to specific contexts and conditions of research (3, 4).

We found that while textbooks made a significantly wider use of bundles beginning with prepositional phrases than those beginning with noun phrases, both of these structural categories were comparatively more evenly employed in articles and theses indicating the divergence of textbooks from the other two genres. The higher tendency of textbook authors to use prepositional LBs could probably be due to the general objective of textbooks, which is presentation of facts and explanations of ideas and arguments. Such a speculation is supported by the fact that a large proportion of the prepositional bundles used in the textbooks had an embedded of-phrase (e.g. in the case of, as part of a, from the point of) which according to Hyland (2008a, P. 10) usually indicate “logical relations between propositional elements”.

Fig. 1. Variation of 4-word LBs across the three genres.

The second most frequent LB structure was noun phrase. Like prepositional phrases, this structure was also quite unevenly distributed across the three genres. Our data showed that while such bundles comprised around $3 5 \%$ of all the bundles in articles and theses, they constituted roughly $2 1 \%$ of the bundles in the textbooks (5, 6). To account for this variation, we consulted the concordance lines where such bundles were used in each of the subcorpora. Our explorations revealed that these noun phrases were often employed to refer to different aspects of the research process by denoting either quantities (the rest of the, a high level of, a number of studies) or qualities (an integral part of, point of view of, the importance of the). It is therefore not surprising to see them more often in theses and articles which are basically research reports than in textbooks which are usually dedicated to theoretical arguments and research synthesis.

(5) The teachers deny the fact that they correct students on the spot, whereas the majority of the students either strongly or just agree with the fact that they are corrected on the spot. (Articles)   
(6) In order to successfully evaluate the effectiveness of the model, comparison schools within the district were identified. (Textbooks)

The divergence of textbooks from the other two genres was also observed, albeit to a smaller extent, in using anticipatory-it structures. Although this structural category was one of the least common ones among all the three genres, there was only one instance of that, it is important to, used in the textbook corpus. Although this phrase occurred 182 times in the textbooks we examined, it did not make up more than $2 \%$ of all the 4-word LBs used in the textbooks. Hyland (2008a) also reported that anticipatory-it structure had the lowest frequency among the structural categories and comprised only $5 . 6 \%$ of the structures in his applied linguistics corpus. While this structure seems to be generally infrequent in applied linguistics texts, its occurrence with an absolute minimum frequency in the textbooks merits attention. While these structures are usually used by authors to express their evaluations of (i.e. it is clear that) or draw readers’ attention to (i.e. it should be noted) a proposition, our examination of articles and theses showed that many of these bundles were used to either mitigate the certainty of claims (e.g. it is possible that) or report the results (e.g. it was found that). It can therefore be argued that since textbook authors write from a more secure standpoint and are not as highly concerned with such mitigating phrases as are writers of theses and articles, they see little need to use such phrases. Moreover, textbooks, unlike theses and articles, are not concerned with reporting original findings as they are not products of first-hand research and would rarely use phrases with such a purpose.

# 4.2. Function of bundles

Turning to functions of LBs, we found a considerable connection between functional and structural categories. Analysis of the whole corpus showed that anticipatory-it and prepositional patterns were the most common structures in participantoriented and text-oriented LBs making up $3 0 \%$ and $4 8 \%$ of the bundles in each of these two functional categories respectively. While half of the research-oriented bundles in our 5.7 million word corpus had a prepositional form, noun phrase structures also made up $4 3 \%$ of the bundles within this functional category. As can be seen in Table 6, LBs with a researchoriented function were the most frequent across all the three genres with text-oriented and participant-oriented bundles ranking second and third respectively. Despite such a similar pattern in the frequency of functions across the three genres, we observed inter-genre differences in the distribution of the functions and subfunctions, which can signify what goals writers pursue through the linguistic choices they make.

# 4.2.1. Research-oriented bundles

Research-oriented bundles constituted about half of the bundles used in our whole corpus and the largest proportion of bundles in all the three genres. They, however, appeared with a greater concentration in theses and dissertations comprising almost $6 0 \%$ of all the bundles used in this genre. Given that such bundles are, by definition, used to refer to the various dimensions of research content and process, they may convey a more empirical and objective impression on readers. Students might have used such bundles in their texts to minimize authorial presence and interpretations and maximize impersonality, an approach which reflects apprentice writers’ tendency to avoid linguistic realizations of voice in their academic writings (Dressen-Hammouda, 2008; Botelho de Magalh\~aes et al., 2019; Peng, 2019).

As Table 6 shows, within the research-oriented category, description subfunction was considerably more frequent in theses than in the other two genres (7). This can be justified on the grounds that students try to demonstrate their mastery over the scope, content, and methodological aspects of their research. To prove this to their target audience and specifically their thesis committee, they may describe more extensively the objects, participants, instruments, and contexts of their research.

(7) This inquiry took a bottom-up approach to allow English teachers to describe the realities in their teaching context and how those realities impact the implementation of the National English Program. (Theses)

Our data also revealed that textbooks, compared to the other two genres, employed fewer procedure bundles (8). This is not unexpected as textbooks are often presentations of topics and only rarely reports of research procedures.

(8) The natural reaction of most teachers to what Foucault describes, and what some governments try to achieve through the use of tests, ranges from distaste to outrage. (Textbooks)

Articles, on the other hand, included the highest percentage of procedure bundles (9) and the lowest percentage of topic bundles (10). It seems that in textbooks and articles, there is probably an inverse relationship between the use of topic and procedure bundles such that the more extensive elaboration of research procedures entails a more concise review of research background and key topics and vice versa.

(9) The data used in this analysis were collected with the help of in-depth interviews pre-, mid- and post-study abroad, accompanied by biweekly e-journals during the sojourn. (Articles)   
(10) Horwitz et al. (1986) note that anxiety related to learning in a foreign language can be classified into three primary components: communication apprehension, fear of negative evaluation, and test anxiety. (Articles)   
(11) Under these circumstances, in recent years, the importance of focusing on lexis has been widely recognised in theories of second language acquisition. (Theses)   
(12) Approximately 25 min were allotted for the task in order to provide learners with sufficient time. (Theses)

Theses, however, did not follow such a pattern as both these subfunctions were widely used in these texts. Hyland (2008a, p. 15) also reported that theses and dissertations comprised a far higher proportion of bundles “which set out procedures” and “refer to the specific topic or context of the research”. The underlying reason for this observation can be the approximately equal weight this genre assigns to both topical reviews (11) and procedural descriptions (12). Students are actually required to fully demonstrate both their familiarity with the previous literature and their skills in research methods and procedures.

# 4.2.2. Text-oriented bundles

Text-oriented bundles were the second most frequent bundles both in our whole corpus and across the three subcorpora. Generally employed to connect ideas, signpost the texts and scaffold arguments, these bundles were also subject to intergenre variations. While $3 9 . 9 \%$ of the various bundles used in articles and $3 8 . 2 \%$ of those in the textbooks had text-oriented functions, theses and dissertations employed 65 different strings which made up $2 7 . 7 \%$ of all the bundle types masters and doctoral students used in their texts. This underuse of text-oriented phrases, in addition to the overuse of researchoriented LBs, by masters and doctoral students suggests that apprentice writers prioritize the content of their research to the organization and coherence of its presentation. Since text-oriented bundles are also linguistic means of reasoning and persuasion, novice academic writers may lag behind experts of their fields in employing such disciplinarily conventionalized devices of rhetorical argumentation. Such an apparent inadequacy in academic literacy, which is among other things rooted in masters and doctoral students’ limited readings in their discipline, can be further intensified by students’ lower levels of linguistic competence and limited experience in writing. While such a reasoning clarifies, to some extent, the lower frequency of text-oriented strings in students’ texts, doubts remain over whether a tendency to use certain linguistic devices less frequently is rooted in incompetence or mastery as familiarity can also breed contempt, hence underemployment.

Of all the text-oriented bundles, those with a framing function were the most frequent in all the three genres. Such bundles are usually used to impose limiting conditions on general statements through specification and exemplification:

(13) What this suggests is that the degree to which memory episodes are entrenched in the brain reflects the ease or difficulty of retrieving semantic memories. (Theses)   
(14) When it comes to the vocabulary size of educated native speakers, one of the most oft-cited figures is about 20,000 word families or 32,000 vocabulary items, excluding proper names. (Textbooks)   
(15) PCK model represents a blend of content and pedagogy with those aspects of subject matter that are accumulated together in the form of an instructional plan or a course description. (Articles)

The higher proportion of framing signals, compared to other text-oriented devices, in all our genres suggests that writers within the field of applied linguistics place great importance on making connections between propositions and providing detailed and specific explanations which may better contextualize their research and make it more reader-friendly. Such a discursive strategy seems to be necessary in a soft knowledge interdisciplinary field of study with readership from diverse discourse communities holding diverse, and at times contradicting, expectations of academic prose.

Inter-genre comparisons showed that the framing bundles used in textbooks were more diverse and frequent than those of theses which were, in turn, more so than those of articles. This is not surprising given that the genre of textbooks is instructive and explanatory whereas that of theses and articles is descriptive and reportorial. This interpretation is further strengthened by the fact that textbooks repeated only one string to “describe” results while $8 . 8 \%$ and $4 . 2 \%$ of the different bundles in articles and theses respectively were resultative signals. While generally not much frequent across the three subcorpora, structuring signals were also used more sparingly in textbooks. We found that while all the structuring bundles in articles and theses were used to refer to the study, research questions, and tables, LBs in textbooks were employed to refer only to sections and chapters. The organization of textbooks into smaller chapters which rarely include research questions and graphical information appears to have made the use of such referring devices less necessary and attractive to textbook authors.

(16) In the previous section, we have elaborated on collocations as examples of lexical partnerships. (Textbooks) (17) Means and standard deviations of the two interviews and the overall scores are presented in Table 4.(Theses) (18) In the current study, we make a similar distinction between heritage language (HL) and non-heritage language (NHL) learners. (Articles)

# 4.2.3. Participant-oriented bundles

Realizing the more personal aspects of academic texts, bundles with participant-oriented function were the least frequent and varied strings in the whole corpus and across the three genres. The lower use of these bundles seems to be a general feature of academic texts as it has been observed not only interdisciplinarily (Hyland, 2008a) but also intergenerically (Wei & Lei, 2011). While engagement features serve to open up avenues for dialogue with the readers and attract their attention (19), stance devices express writers’ evaluations of and commitment to the seemingly objective propositions in the text (20). These discursive strategies might be common in conversational and fictional registers (Biber et al., 1999). However, extensive use of stance and engagement devices, which usually embed epistemic and affective appraisals, is not much anticipated in university writing which is dominated by positivistic views that value empirical and quantitative objectivity (Mirhosseini, 2017), and prefer a “neutral and detachedly descriptive” language (Mauranen & Bondi, 2003, p. 269).

(19) Consequently, if you want to read texts in Old English or Middle English, you must master not only the language but the orthography as well. (Textbooks)   
(20) Therefore, it is necessary to consider learners’ proficiency levels when examining their preferred OCF types on specific errors. (Articles)

Our data revealed that, in contrast to research-oriented and text-oriented bundles, participant bundles showed very little variation across the three subcorpora. This is in contrast to the findings of Wei and Lei (2011) who reported that while published articles and doctoral dissertations in the field of applied linguistics used an almost similar amount of research and text-oriented bundles, they differed widely in employing participant-oriented bundles. This discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that our theses and dissertation subcorpus included theses from English speaking universities while Wei and Lei (2011) examined only the English dissertations written by Chinese students studying at Chinese universities. As to the variation of participant-oriented bundles, Hyland (2008a) also reported considerable interdisciplinary differences in their employment with social sciences using such bundles almost twice as often as hard sciences. It can therefore be concluded that intergeneric uniformity, as observed in the use of participant-oriented bundles in our study, depends not only on authors’ L1 but also on the discipline to which the texts belong. In other words, intergeneric uniformity in certain linguistic choices within one discipline and in the texts of authors with the same L1 can realize as intergeneric variation in another discipline and in the texts of authors with a different L1 (Gardner et al., 2019; Yoon & Romer, 2020 € ).

Another interesting finding of our inter-genre comparisons was that theses included the highest and lowest proportion of stance (21) and engagement features (22) respectively.

(21) This research documents that it is possible to integrate students’ home languages into ESL, ELD, and curriculum subject area teaching in Ontario schools. (Theses)   
(22) Before I discuss the results of the interview, it should be noted that the participants were unaware that so and other English discourse markers are called discourse markers. (Theses)

This disinclination of apprentice writers to address their readers directly may make their texts more reader responsible than articles and textbooks as engagement markers not only help readers better orient themselves in relation to the text but also make them feel an authorial and authoritative presence. The slightly higher inclination of theses writers to express personal evaluation using stance markers, on the other hand, may initially be interpreted as a sign of more authoritative language. Our further examination of the instances of stance markers used by masters and doctoral students, however, revealed that almost $4 0 \%$ of the stance markers in theses served to hedge claims and mitigate the certainty of the statements. This further supports previous findings that students usually refrain from assuming responsibility for their claims and prefer to preserve their impersonality (El-Dakhs, 2018).

# 5. Conclusions

EAP research has witnessed rapid developments in two opposing directions during the past two decades. One of these research streams has highlighted the similarities among various fields of study and encouraged EAP practitioners to invest in interdisciplinary common grounds. Scholars within the other camp have, however, emphasized specificity of language features and discourse practices of each discipline, hence promoting EAP courses and materials that involve teaching of the skills which are appropriate to particular disciplinary communities. While distinctiveness of various disciplines is supported at many levels, research on inter-genre variation within the same discipline is comparatively limited and scarce. This may imply that intradisciplinary variation is, in general, small-scale and deserves less attention than does cross-disciplinary variation. However, this study showed that as far as the use of LBs is concerned, uniformity and variation are of almost equal weight in disciplinary writing. EAP pedagogy should therefore pay due attention to both ends of this continuum and make students aware that while disciplinary writing seems uniform, it may vary at different levels based on various text and author characteristics.

Our data revealed that while $4 8 \%$ , $2 7 \%$ and $3 7 \%$ of the LBs used in textbooks, articles and theses respectively were exclusive to that genre, the rest of the bundles were shared by two or all the three genres. This finding can challenge the specificitygenerality dichotomy in EAP by showing that LBs used in the texts of a given discipline can be of both general and specific nature. It is then no surprise if we hypothesize that of our cross-generic bundles, for example, some are discipline-specific and others cross-disciplinary, and of the cross-disciplinary bundles, some may be exclusive to university language while others might appear as frequently in fiction, news and even religious sermons. It can thus be concluded that linguistic features of academic texts are both general and specific with neither type overshadowing the other in theoretical and pedagogical significance. Such a conclusion has its own empirical evidence in the literature. For example, the existence of general academic bundles is supported by Simpson-Vlach and Ellis’ (2010) academic formula list which includes formulaic sequences that “occur significantly more often in academic than in non-academic discourse”, “inhabit a wide range of academic genres” and are conceived as pedagogically valuable by EAP instructors (p. 487). Reppen and Olson (2020) also showed that shared bundles are found even across as many as nine disciplines.

Association and dissociation of certain linguistic features with given disciplines, however, run the risk of misleading EAP practitioners and students by making them think that they should use certain features and avoid others in all their disciplinary writing regardless of genre and text sections (Gardner et al., 2019). We therefore take the issue of specificity a stage further and suggest that while at the very general end of the specificity-generality spectrum, there are commonalities between academic and non-academic texts, at its most specific end, we may find LBs that are significantly more frequent in a part-genre (e.g., method section of articles). EAP teachers and students alike should thus be conscious of such subtle nuances of intradisciplinary variations, which are sometimes markers of academic writing competence. In fact, lists of bundles which are presented in descriptive studies like the current one cannot alone shape the basis of pedagogical decisions unless their values are evaluated by EAP instructors and their content is modified to accommodate the needs of students and the limitations of the curricula. This is an area which can be explored in future research.

To conclude, our findings are not meant to stereotype academic writing as a rigid and predetermined composition style where following in the footsteps of previous researchers is encouraged and creativity is supressed. First, the works compiled in our corpus represent varying quality. While not all published textbooks and articles realize the same level of writing quality and expertise, theses and dissertations are much more varied in the quality of their presentation. As Bunton (2002, p.73) maintains, “while some theses on the library shelves may have been considered excellent, others may have only been just acceptable - as a result the text analyst may not know whether the theses being analysed are good models or not”. Second, expertise in academic writing is beyond just familiarity with community-sensitive linguistic resources and is, among others, about concepts such as clarity of ideas, soundness of arguments, attractiveness of the message and smoothness of the flow of text, many of which are elusive to define and difficult to measure. EAP practitioners are therefore advised to take the findings of such a descriptive research as guidelines to begin with and not rules to blindly follow, as academic writing expertise flourishes to its fullest potential not with imitation but by creativity.
