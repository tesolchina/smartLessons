Telecollaboration

This study investigated the effectiveness of peer and teacher feedback during telecollaboration, specifically, a semester-long email exchange. Participants included 38 students from three sections of a second-semester German course at a US university. They were paired with 40 students of English at a high school in Germany. Of the three second-semester German sections, one group was assigned to a peer feedback condition $\left( N = 1 5 \right)$ , one to a teacher feedback condition $( N = 1 0 )$ and one to a telecollaboration-only condition $( N = 1 3$ . Over the course of the semester, each learner sent one German and one English email per week to their email partner. The peer feedback group received corrective feedback on their German emails from their email partners whereas the teacher feedback group received corrections from their instructor. The telecollaboration-only group did not receive corrections. Results from the DIALANG writing test for German, administered at the beginning and the end of the semester, showed that the peer feedback group improved the most on measures of L2 writing, the teacher feedback group made some improvement, and the telecollaboration-only group did not improve. Additional data from tailor-made posttests mirrored these results. Pedagogical implications of these findings are discussed.

# 1. Introduction

Telecollaboration, that i, virtual exchanges such as email xchanges or video-conferences between leners from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds, has become increasingly popular in second language (L2) clasrooms in the past two decade, and perhaps even more so during the coviD-19 pandemic. There are many reasons to implement telecollaboration into L2 classrooms. Most importantly, virtual exchanges can promote learners' intercultural competence (O'Dowd & Dooly, 2020) and language development (Schenker, 2016).

Although some telecollaboration research focuses on language development (Satar & Ozdener, 2008; Schenker, 2016, 2017), this research does not typicall icorporate corrective feedback (CF) into the exchanges in a systematic manner. Given that CF plays a crucial role in classroom L2 learning and has been shown to be effctive both in the oral and written domain Li, 2010; Kang & Han 2015), the present study examined the role of F during telecollaboration. Specificall, the study investigated whether students who received written feedback during a semester-long email exchange improved their writing proficiency more than students who participated in the same email exchange but received no feedback. Moreover, the study examined whether CF was more beneficial when given by an email partner (\*peer feedback") or by the course instructor (teacher feedback").

# 2. Review of the literature

In the past decades, the field of second language acquisition (SLA) has seen a spike in research studies dealing with tele. collaboration. Overall these studies overwhelmingly show that telecollaboration is an effctive tool to promote both intercultural competence (Chen & Yang, 2014; Liaw, 2006; O'Dowd & Dooly, 2020; Thome-Williams, 2016) and second language acquisition (Angelova & Zhao, 2016; Kabata & Edasawa, 2011; Satar & Ozdener, 2008; Schenker, 2016, 2017; Yanguas, 2012). For example, Schenker (2016) reported that a semester-long email exchange improved learners syntactic complexity, and Angelova and Zhao (2016) found that a writtenvirtual exchange helped learners improve their grammar. In the oral domain, Satar and Ozdener (2008) reported that text-chats and voice-chats improved learners' speaking proficiency.

Since telecollaboration is such a powerful tool for cultural and language learning, some researchers have argued that it should become aregular component of L2 casrooms (Ciftci & Savas, 2018; ODowd, 2016). However, researchers have also pointed out that linguistic gains are "by no means automatic and [..] exchanges need to be set up with care as well as with an awareness of best practices" (Godwin- Jones, 2019, p. 8). One limitation of telecollaboration as typically implemented in language classrooms is the lack of CF (Tai et al., 2015; Ware & O'Dowd, 2008). A notable exception is a study by Ware and O'Dowd (2008). In this study, the re. searchers investigated how and to what extent learners of English and Spanish provided feedback to their exchange partners during online communication, specificall during weekly asynchronous discussions. Learners were assigned to one of two experimental conditions: in the first condition (referred to as "-utoring), students were asked correct linguistic forms they peceived as inorrect; in the second condition (referred to as "-parnering"), students were not asked to correct errors but could do so ontheir own initiative. Findings indicated that although students in both conditions expressed a desire for receiving feedback from their exchange partners, such feedack ony occurred when explicitly require (that is in thee-ttoring condtion). While this study did not investigate whether students in thee-tutoring condtion improed ther language skill as a result of the fdack (and f they improved more than students in the e-partnering condition), the study showed that teaching students how to respond to their exchange partners errors led to more instances of feedback during telecollaboration.

SLA research in areas outside of telecollaboration has reported similar findings. For instance, Fuji et al. (2016) investigated Whether training learners to provide CF to each ther resulted in more instance of feedack during oral classoom interactions. While the experimental group was trained to correct their peers errors, the Telecollaboration Only Group was not instructed to do so. Results showed that learners in the experimental group provided more feedback and made better use of the feedback they received than learners in the Telecollaboration Only Group.

In addition to examining whether peer feedback training leads to more instances of feedback, SLA research (but not telecollaboration reearch) has systematically investigated whether peer feedback can benefit second language development. A growing number of research studies provides evidence that peer fedback is beneficial for language development both in the written and oral domain, as long as instructor as students to correct their peers errors and teach them how to do so (Lundstrom & Baker, 2009; Martin & Sippel, 2021; Sato & Lyster, 2012; Toth, 2008). For example, in the oral domain, Sato and Lyser (2012) trained learners to correct their pers grammatical mistakes during oral peer interaction activities. They found that only students who received such training improved in terms of grammatical accuracy. In the written domain, Lundstrom and Baker (2009) examined whether peer review facilitated learners' writing. They found that i was beneficial, especiallyfor the students who provided pr feedback rather than received it. Based on this reearch, one would expect that peerfedback during telecollaboration also has the potential to facilitate 2 development It i also noteworthy that learners wish to receive CF on their erors i clsroom settings, both from teachers and from peers (Jean & Simard, 2011; Kaivanpanah et al., 2015; Kartchava, 2016; Sato, 2013; Schulz, 1996, 2001; Sippel, 2020). Thus, one would expect that learners wish to receive feedback during virtual exchanges as well(see also Ware & O'Dowd, 2008)

While there has been increased interest in pee feedback in recent years the majority of CF studies has examined teacher feedback. both in the oral and the written domain. Overall there i ample eidence fr the efectivenes of oral and written teacher feedback, as shown by seral meta-analyses (e.g., Li, 2010, for oral feedback; Kang & Han, 2015 for wrtten feedack). Relevant to the present study, several studies on written CF have shown that i is more efective than no fdback. For example, itchener (2008) found that written feedback focusing on English articles (that is, focused feedback) led to more improvement in grammatical accuracy than no feedback. In another study, Frear and Chiu (2015) compared the effctiveness of written CF on weak verbs (focused feedback) to written CF on all structures (unfocused feedback) and found that both led to greater accuracy than no feedback. In a meta-analysis Kang and Han (2015) also reported a substantive effect of written CF on L2 written accuracy.

In addition, some reearch has compared the efectivenes of teacher feedback to that of per feedack. This reearch has produced mixed findings. In the oral domain, Sippel and Jackson (2015) investigated the efectivenessof peer and teacher feedack during classrom interactions. Results showed that inthe short term, both peer and teacher feedback facilitated the acquisition of gram matical structres but in the long term, peer feedback was sightly more efective than teacher fedack. In another study, Martin and Sippel (2021) compared the effectivenes of providing peer feedback, receiving peer feedback, receiving teacher feedback, and receiving no feedback on pronunciation. Results showed that whileall experimental conditions were more efective than no feedback. providing pr feedback helped leaners improve their own pronunciation the most, followed by receiving teacher feedback, followed by receiving per feedback follow-up study further revealed that per feedack providers showed bettr retention of learning gains over time than teacher feedback receivers (Martin & Sippel, 2023). In the written domain, Yang et al.(2006) compared peer and teacher feedback on learners essays. Findings indicated that teacher feedback was more likely to be adopted and led to greater im provements in writing. Taken together, these studies suggest that the relative effectiveness of peer and teacher fedback may be mediated by a number of factors, such as the nature of the linguistic target or the medium of the feedback (oral or written).

From a theoretical perspective, the interaction approach (Gass & Mackey, 2015; Long, 1996) supports both the use of tele. collaboration and CF in L2 classooms. This approach stresses not only the importance of interaction between learners and other speakers f the 2 (., teecollaboration), but as the crucial role of negative evidece (i., CF). Fedack draws leners attention to potential problems with their interlanguage, encourages them to modify their output, and facilitates their noticing of non-target-like forms in their own language productions in the future. According to Schmidt's (1990, 2001) noticing hypothesis, this noticing of non-target-like forms is esential for second language development. Therefore, learners should be encouraged to notice mismatches between their own language productions and target language forms (Mitchell et al., 2013).

# 3. Present study

In light of the lack of previous studies that systematically investigate the efectiveness of CF during telecollaboration using a pretest-posttes design, the present study examined wrien CF during asemester-long email exchange between leaners of German at a US university and leners of English at a German high school. Specifically, the study compared the efectivenessof per fdback. teacher feedback, and no feedback on learners email. While we use the term \*pee feedack' to refer t feedback provided by email partners, we recognize that email partners are not the same as \*"peers' in an L2 classroom: unlike \*peers' in an L2 classroom, the "peers' in the present study lived in an environment and went to a school where the language that their partners were learning was spoken, and in many cases, it was their L1 (first language).

Learning gains were assessed by means of a pre- and post-writing-test as well as individualized tailor-made posttests. The stud. addressed the following research questions:

RQ1: To what extent does correctivefeedback during telecollaoration improve learners writing proficiency when compared to no eedback?

RQ2: Is corrctive feedback during an email exchange more effective when provided by peer that i, email partners or teachers?

# 4. Methods

# 4.1. Participants

Thirty-eight participants (16 females, 22 males from a private US universty took part i the study. Their average age was 21 years $( \mathbf { r a n g e } = 1 8 - 3 4$ $S D = 3 . 6 8 \mathrm { \Omega }$ . The majority of the participants $( 5 8 \% )$ identified as monolingual L1 speakers of English, $2 1 \%$ identified as bilinguals (L1 English and another L1), and the remaining $2 1 \%$ were L2 speakers of English. At the time of the study, all participants were enrolled in one of thre sections f a second-semester German course at the universty. All thre sections of this course use the same curriculum, following the communicative approach. The main objectives of the course were the improvement of learners speaking, listening, reading, and writing abilities in a cultural context. Some participants $( 3 7 \% )$ had chosen to study German as an elective, but most $( 6 3 \% )$ were taking the class to fulfill the university's foreign language requirement.

In addition to the 38 US participants, 40 students from a German high schoo took part in the study. They were 16-18 years old, and they were either juniors or senors at the high school. Allof them were enrolled in an English clss a the time of te study. Unlike the US participants, who received credit for participating in the email exchange, the German high schoo students had volunteered to participate in the exchange. The present study focuses only on the learning gains of the US participants.

At the begining of the semester, each section of the second-semester German course at the US university was assigned to either the PeerF Group $( N = 1 5$ , the TeacherF Group $( N = 1 0 )$ , or the Telecollaboration Only Group $( N = 1 3$ . A one-way ANOVA comparing participants' writing proficiency on the writing section of the DIALANG test (Lancaster University, n.d.) showed no significant dif. ference between the three groups $( \mathrm { F } _ { 2 , 3 5 } = 1 . 1 9 , p = . 3 1 5 )$ , confirming that the groups were of similar writing proficiency at the onset of the study.

Three different instructors taught the three sections. The PeerF Group and the Telecollaboration Only Group were taught by graduate student intructors who were L2 speakers of German, and the TeacherF Group was taught by a language lector who was an L1 speaker of German. The researchers supervised the project but did not participate in the study as instructors.

# 4.2. Instructional materials and procedure

At the beginning of the semester, each US participant was assigned an email partner from the partner high school in Germany. Before partners were assigned, student from both schools wrote down their academic and personal interests on a piece of paper. This information was used to match students with a partner who shares similar interests. The email exchange took place weekly over the course of a 13-week-semester. It strted in week 2 of the semester and was on hold during chool breaks (three weeks total). Therefore the email exchange took place during nine weeks of the semester. Every week, the U participants itiated the exchange on Monday by sending an email to their partners, written in German. The researchers provided the topics for the German email (the list of topics is provided in Appendix A). By Wednesday, the German participants responded to the German email They were instructed to write the first half of their email in German. In this firt half of the emal, they commented on the topicof the Monday email. In the second half of their email,the German partcipants were instructed to write about a different topic, provided by their English teachers, in English. By iday, the US participants responded to the email from Wednesday in English.

Students in the Telecollaboration Only Group were not given any feedback on their emails. Students in the PerF and TeacherF Group were given CF on allof their emails wrtten in German (except during the first wee of the exchange) by either their partner in Germany (PerF Group) or their instructor (TeacherF Group), and both students in the PeerF and TeacherF Group gave feedback to their email partners on their emails written in English. Because the preent study focuses on the US participants, we wil focus here on the feedback given to US participants.

During the first week of the project, the German high school teachers had instructed the high chool students whose email partners were in the PerF Group to corrct their email partners errors. To do so, the high school students copied and pasted the email from Monday into a Word Document and then used the "Comment function to provide direct writte feedack on any erorsthey noticed. Direct fedback was chosen because it was assumed that this type of feedback would be easiest for the German high chool students to provide, since they were L1 speakers of the language who did not have previous teaching experience. Comprehensive feedback (i. feedback on all types of errors) was chosen after the researchers found during the first week of the email exchange that the German learners did not make sufficient mistakes in their emails to justfy a more focused approach to feedback. It i ikely that leaners made fewer mistakes because the exchange was written rather than oral, giving them enough time to write their sentences.

Example 1 contains a sentence from an email written by a US participant about their trip to Munich.

(1) Wir haben \*ins Hofbrauhaus und \*die Restaurant Dicke Sophie gegessen [We ate in the Hofbrauhaus and the restaurant Dicke Sophie].

The German high school student highlighted the ungrammatical parts of the sentence \*ins" [into the] and \*die [the, feminine, nominative or accusative case] using the comment function and then provided the corrct words \*im' in the] in the first comment and "dem'" [the, neuter, dative case] in the second comment. In the TeacherF Group, participants received the same type of feedback on their emails. However, the feedback was provided by their instructor rather than their email partner. nce the students in either group had received ther fedback, they were asked to revise their nitil email, highlight the parts that they had correcte, and upload the final version of their email to the learning management system used by their university. Since students in the Telecollaboration Only Group did not receive feedback on their emails, they were not required to revise their emails.

# 4.3. Pre- and post-assessments

To asses to what extent the feedback provided by email partners (PeerF Group) and teachers (TeacherF Group) had impacted the students' writing proficiency and general proficiency in German, students in all three groups completed two tests.

The frst est was the DIALANG test (Lancaster University, n.d.). Research has confirmed the validity of ths test (Alderson, 2005) The test is based on the proficiency scales of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR), with six potential outcomes: A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, or C2. The DIALANG test is available online and isfre of charge. It consists of five parts: reading, writing, listening, vocabulary, and grammar. The participants of the present study only completed the writing part of the test, once at the beinning f the semester (pretest) and once at the end of the semester (postest). Because one student from the Perf Group did not complete the DIALANG posttest, 37 participants are included in the results presented below.

The second test was a tailor-made postet. Although tailo-made tests are les common, there is ample precedence for the benefits of using them in SLA research (e.g., Arellano-Soto & Parks, 2021; McDonough & Sunitham, 2009; Payant & Kim, 2017; Swain & Watanabe, 2013; Zeng & Takatsuka, 2009). The main advantage of these tests isthat they are individualized rather than standardized. For instance, in the present study, tailor-made postests were designed based on the individual errors participants had made in their emails and the peronalized feedback they had reived onthee xact errors. Tus, unlike the IANG writing test, which allowed us to asses students general writing proficiency in German before and after the email exchange, the tailor- made postests allowed us to asses whether learners benefited from specific feedback they had received during the exchange. Overall, a combination of astan. dardized testing instrument (such as the DIALANG writing test) and an individualized testing instrument (such as the tailor-made posttests) allow for more precision and greater depth in assessing learning gains between and within groups, thus, making findings more reliable and generalizable.

Each tailor-made postes contained 25 items and consisted of four sections. The first section was a il-in-the blank translation task testing a variety of linguistic targets such as vocabulary items, definite articles, or possessive adjectives (see example 2).

(2) (when) machen die Kinder ihre Hausaufgaben? [When do the kids do their homework?].

The second section was another fllin-the blank task testing grammatical gender, case, and number (see example 3).

(3) Frau Wagner mag am liebsten italienisch__ Essen. [Frau Wagner prefers Italian food.].

The third section was an error correction task which required participants to find the error in a given sentence and corrc it (see example 4). This task was used for a wide variety of linguistic targets, including word order, subject-verb agreement, and vocabulary

(4) Claire findet, dass Deutsch ist eine schone Sprache. [Claire thinks German is a beautiful language.].

The fourth section was a multiple-choice task (see example 5). This task was also used for a variety of linguistic targets, including Jrepositions, verb conjugation, and vocabulary.

(5) Sumita, Lydia und Yamina Okonkwo gehen jeden Tag um 8 Uhr a) nach Schule b) nach ihre Schule c) zu Schule d) zur Schule. [Sumita, Lydia, and Yamina Okonkwo go to school every day at 8 o'clock.].

The researchers designed 38 tailor-made posttests, one for each participant. (One example of atailor-made posttest is provided in Appendix B.) Before designing the tests, the resarchers identified what errors participants had made in their emails over the course of the semester, whether they had received feedback onthese errors, and if they had, whether they had corrected these errors in thir revised emails. The researchers then designed 25 test items for each participant. The items in the tailor-made posttests only targeted those inguistic items that students had used incorrectly in their email, reived fedack on from their partner r intructor, and then successflly corrected in their revised emails Because students made very different types of mistakes, each test was different. For example, some tests only contained very few items in the second section (ill-i-the blank task) whereas others contained many. This was because some students made many mistakesrlated to grammatical gender, case, and number, whereas other made fewer mistakes in this area.

In addition to the DIALANG test and the tailor-made postes, students completed an exit survey which asked students to answer four open-ended questions, specifically, what they liked about the email exchange, what they learned from the exchange, how it could be improved, and, in the PerF Group and the TeacherF Group, what impact they believed the corrections had on their learning.

# 4.4. Scoring and data analysis

To analyze the data from the DIALANG writing test, learners results from the pretest and the posttest were converted from the CEFR scale to a numerical value, following Schenker (2021) and Tschirner (2016). Conversions were coded as CEFR levels $\mathbf { A } \mathbf { 1 } = \mathbf { 1 }$ , A2 $= 2$ $\mathbf { B } \mathbf { 1 } = 3 $ No learner reached the B2, C1, or C2 level, so no conversions above B1 were carried out. The numerical conversion facilitated descriptive statistics and statistical analysis, but we acknowledge that EFR scores do not represent linear changes in learners' progress toward higher levels of L2 writing proficiency (see Schenker, 2018).

The tailor-made posttests were coded by the first author. For reliability measures, the second author coded $2 6 \%$ of the data set. Inter-rater reliability was $9 9 . 8 \%$ . The remaining. $2 \%$ of discrepancies were resolved in discussing the items in question. Each test consisted f 25 items. Some items, such as article, were inary in coding and received ascore of 1 if they were correct and a core of $\mathbf { \vec { \nabla } } _ { 0 } ,$ if they were incorrect. Some items, such as vocabulary items, received a score of 1 if they were correct, a score of " $. 5 ^ { \prime \prime }$ if they were correct but contained a minor spelling mistake that did not render the word incomprehensible (e.g., \*\*Leiblingsfach" instead of "Lieblingsfach" favorite subject'), and $\mathbf { \vec { \omega } } ^ { 6 } 0 ^ { , 5 }$ if the answer was incorrect or no answer was given. Points were added up and a score of correct percentage of answers was computed by dividing the correct points through the total points (e.g., f a leaner had 15 points out of 25, their total score was $6 0 \%$

For the qualitative analysis of the exit survey, grounded theory methodology (Corbin & Straus, 2008) was employed to reveal trends in the data. The data were coded separately by both authors and discrepancies were discussed and resolved. The individual student responses were then organized according to the trends identified and are being provided in the Discussion to contextualize the findings.

Given the unreliable and arbitrary nature of null hypothesis significance testing (Plonsky, 2015), we present bootstrapped descriptive statistics for data analysis below, we focus on an interpretation of standardized effect sizes (Cohen's $d )$ and Confidence Intervals (Cl), and we provide data-rich graphs (following reporting standards set by Larson-Hall & Plonsky, 2015). Cohen's d was calculated using Cambridge University Press and Assessments Effect Size Calculator (n.d.) for between-group comparisons and Mizumoto's R-based application (n.d.) for within-group comparisons. SLA field-specific benchmarks were used for interpretation of these effect sizes: between-group comparison: Cohen's $d = 0 . 4 0$ (small), 0.70 (medium), 1.0 (large) and within-group comparison: Cohen's $d = 0 . 6 0$ (small), 1.00 (medium), 1.4 (large) (Plonsky & Oswald, 2014). As recommended by LaFlair et al. (2015), bootstrapping was performed by resampling 10,o0o times, using a bias-corrected and accelerated $9 5 \%$ CI, and resampling (with replacement) from the entire datasetrather than from within each group separately. By resamplig, boostrapping alows reearchers to simulate a much larger data set, simulating participant numbers in the thousands, and thus making findings more reliable. Since LaFlair et al. (2015) argue in favor of using bootstrapping in conjunction with parametric statistics, particularly when samples are small -as is often the case in L2 research, we also provide results of traditional null hypothesis significance testing. These are. however, interpreted alongside Cis of means and of the difference between group means. For example, Cis can be used as a measure of whether the difference between a pair of mean scores is statistically ignificant f the mean of one group falls outside the CI for the other group's mean, the diffrence between these two means is statisticallysignificant. Moreover, for a CI on the comparison of a difference between two means if the CI does not cover zero, it can be assumed that the difference is statisticallysignificant (see Larson-Hall & Plonsky, 2015; Plonsky, 2015).

# 5. Results

# 5.1. DIALANG writing test

As can be seen in Table 1, $5 7 \%$ of the learners in the PeerF Group improved by either one $( 4 3 \% )$ or even two $( 1 4 \% )$ levels on the CEFR (from A1 to A2, from A2 to B1, or from A1 to B1), while $3 0 \%$ of learners in the TeacherF Group improved by one level (from A1 to A2 or from A2 to B1), and $2 3 \%$ of learners in the Telecollaboration Only Group improved by either one $( 1 5 \% )$ or two $( 8 \% )$ levels (from A1 to A2,from A2 to B1, or from A1 to B1). No learner in the PeerF or the TeacherF Group received a lower CEFR score a the time of the posttest, but $1 4 \%$ of the learners in the Telecollaboration Only Group did. The proportions of these findings are displayed in Fig. 1. Descriptively speaking, it is apparent that almost twice as many learners in the PeerF Group showed an improvement of at least one level on the CEFR as compared to learners in the TeacherF Group, and both groups showed more robust gains than the learners in the Telecollaboration Only Group.

Table 2 provides descriptive statistics and results of statistical analyses to illstrate to what extent the groups postet cores i.e, mean CEFR levels converted into a numeric value) were greater than their pretest scores. The pre-to-post comparison in the PerF Group reaches statistical significance (the $9 5 \%$ CI [0.25, 2.47] does not cross zero) with a medium effect size of Cohen's $d = 1 . 3 6$ The same comparison is not statistically significant in the TeacherF Group (the $9 5 \%$ CI [-0.16, 1.40] crosses zero with a small effect size of Cohen's $d = 0 . 6 2$ ) or in the Telecollaboration Only Group (the $9 5 \%$ CI [--0.50, 0.95] crosses zero with a negligible effect size of Cohen's $d = 0 . 2 3$

# 5.2. Tailor-made posttests

Descriptive statistics for the tailor-made postests are displayed in Table 3. As can be seen in the table, the mean score i.e., mean percentage correct) for the PeerF Group (57.6) does not fall within the bootstrapped $9 5 \%$ CI for the TeacherF Group [28.6, 51.4] or the Telecollaboration Only Group [25.2, 46.2], thus indicating that the difference between the means of the PeerF Group and the other two groups are statisticall significant. The mean score of the TeacherF Group (40.8), however, fall within the boostrapped $9 5 \%$ CI for the Telecollaboration Only Group [25.2, 46.2], thus indicating that there isno statistical difference between the means of these two groups. This i fhr flcd in thfft si fr each eve f omparison twehe grups. he eff iz fo te comparison of the mean percentage correct in the PeerF Group and the TeacherF Group is Cohen's $d = 0 . 9 4$ with the CI for the effect size not crossing zero [0.07, 1.75], suggesting that this comparison is statisticall significant with a medium-to-large effect size. The effct ie for the comparison of the mean percentage correct in the PeerF Group and the Telecollaboration Only Group is Cohen's $d = 1 . 2 0$ with the CI for the effect size not crossing zero [0.36, 1.96], suggesting that this comparison is statisticall significant with large effct size. The effec size for the comparison of the mean percentage correct in the TeacherF Group and the Telecollaboration Only Group i Cohen's $d = 0 . 3 3$ with the CI for the effect size crossing zero $[ - 0 . 5 1$ , 1.15], suggesting that this comparison is not statistically significant with a negligible-to-small effect size. Fig. 2 provides a visual representation of the data spread for each group.

Parametric statistics run in conjunction with the boostrapped descriptive statistics described above (as recommended by LaFlair et al., 2015) show the same pattern of statistical significance That is one-way NOV suggests that thre i a statistically signficant difference between the groups' mean scores $( F _ { 2 , 3 5 } = 5 . 6 1 $ $p = . 0 0 8 )$ . Post hoc independent comparisons (t-tests) suggest that this result stems from the PeerF Group significantly outperforming the TeacherF Group $( t _ { 2 3 } = 2 . 3 2$ $\begin{array} { r } { p = . 0 3 0 ) } \end{array}$ and the Telecollaboration Only Group $( t _ { 2 6 } = 3 . 1 5$ $p = . 0 0 4 )$ . The comparison between the TeacherF and the Telecollaboration Only Group does not reach statistical significance $( t _ { 2 1 } = . 7 8$ $\begin{array} { r } { p = . 4 4 6 ) } \end{array}$

# 6. Discussion

The present study was designed to explore whether written correctie feedback in telecolaboration improves learners' writing proficiency when compared to no feedback (RQ1). It further examined whether CF in telecollaboration is more effective when provided by email partners in the target country or by the leaners course instructor (RQ2). Two testing instruments were employed to answer these questions: each with a diferent objective, but each informing both research questions. The DIALANG writing test provided information about the development of the three groups PerF, TeacherF, Telecollaboration Only Groupover time, that is, over the length of the telecollaborative email exchange spanning one academic semester. The individualized tilor-made ostests on the other hand allowed for acomparison between the thre groups at the end of the semester and provided data on how learners in the feedback groups benefited from the feedback they received.

Results from the DIALANG pre- and posttest revealed that $5 7 \%$ of learners in the PeerF Group improved their writing proficiency by at least one level on the CEFR scale (e.g., from A1 to A2), followed by $3 0 \%$ in the TeacherF Group, and ${ } ^ { 2 3 \% }$ in the Telecollaboration Only Group. That is descriptively speaking, both groups that received fedback showed more improvement than the group that did not receive feedback. Notably, gains in the PeerF Group were almost twiceas strong as gains in the Telecollaboration Only Group. When looking at statistical significance for pre- to postest comparisons, only the PeerF Group improved significantly in their writing proficiency over the course of the semester. This comparison had a medium effec size. These trends were further reflected in the results from the tailor-made postes, comparing the magnitude of improvement betwen learners in each group at the end of the email exchange. The PeerF Group significantl outperformed both the TeacherF and the Telecollaboration Only Group with a medium-tolarge effect (PeerF $>$ TeacherF) and a large effect (PeerF $>$ Telecollaboration Only) for the end-of-semester comparison. The TeacherF Group did not significantly outperform the Telecollaboration Only Group and this comparison only reached a negligible-to-small effect size.

These findings clearly inform the research questions of the present study. Firs, taken together, they suggest that receiving written CF in a telecollaboratie etting is more efective in improving learners writing proficiency than not rceiving feedback. This can be seen in the data showing larger benefits among the two groups that rceived written CF s compared to the group that did not i., improvement in DIALANG: PeerF $5 7 \%$ & TeacherF $3 0 \% >$ Telecollaboration Only $2 3 \%$ mean percentage correct in tailor-made posttests: PeerF $5 8 \%$ & TeacherF $4 1 \% >$ Telecollaboration Only $3 5 \%$ . This finding is in line with previous research showing that written CF is effctive in improving leaners L2 proficiency (Kang & Han, 2015). I is particularl important, however, n light of the fact that telcollaboration has recently received increasing atention, but so far, studies have focused predominantly on benefit in intercultural competence or language acquisition in general (Angelova & Zha0, 2016; Satar & Ozdener, 2008; Schenker, 2016; Thome-Williams, 2016), rather than on the role and potential of CF. Knowing that learners generally express a desire to receive feedback (Jean & Simard, 2011), and that instructing them to provide feedback increases instances of such feedback (Ware & O'Dowd 2008), it is important to see that receiving feedback also leads to gains in L2 writing proficiency.

Regarding the question whether feedback in telecollaboration is more efective when provided by the email partner in the target country or by the instructor,results suggested that feedback from the partners in Germany was most beneficial. This was revealed by the findings that (1) in the pre- to post omparison (DIALANG test),only the PeerF Group showed significant improvement in writing proficiency from the beginning to the end of the semester, and (2) at the end of the email exchange (tailor-made posttests), the Peer Group significantly outperformed the other two groups on measures of grammatical and lexical accuracy in L2 writing. These findings are in line with previous research that has also found peer feedback to be beneficial in improving learners' writing proficiency (Lundstrom & Baker, 2009), as well a reearch that has shown larger benefits stemming from peer feedback when compared to teacher feedback (Martin & Sippel, 2021, 2023; Sipel & Jackson, 2015; but ee Yang et al., 2006. However, previous research looked at peer feedback among L2 learners in the same countr, thus, all pers were leaners of the same 2 rather than peers in a telecollaborative setting where pers reside in the country of the targeted L2. Nevertheless there are several reasons that could eplain why learners in the PeerF Group still outperformed learners in the TeacherF Group in the telecollaborative setting. These particularl revealed themselves when taking into ccount the leaners responses to the exit survey. That is in the learners' responses, it became apparent how important the authenticity of the exchange with their email partners in Germany was to them, specificall, how influential it was that their partners were of a similar age and living in the target country. The survey showed an overwhelming number of responses such as:

![](img/0608a8ce6440bce26f87be692c159761aa182a7b8e8113dc3529b8c6985df925.jpg)  
Fig. 2. Visual Representation of Data Spread on the Tailor-Made Posttest for Each Group.

(1) It was very interesting to be able to connect to people similar to my age in Germany. - P302   
(2) I liked having exposure to the way someone my age would construct phrases, as opposed to just a textbook example. - P313   
(3) I enjoyed practicing my German skills with a native speaker. - P309   
(4) You get to know an actual person and have a peek of their life. - P112   
(5) I liked having a source for how actual Germans speak/writ. We are exposed to a lot of German, but its often hard to tell how   
things are really said/which translations don't really work/are too literal. - P301

Considering these responses, it comes as no surprise that feedback provided by these peers in Germany was more meaningful/ valuable to the leanersand as such, moreffctive-than the feedback provided by the instrctor. This might especially be the case when considering that the feedback during the email exchange was the only feedback the learners received from their partners Whereas the fedack the leaners in the Teacher Group received was just additionalfeedback amongst a wealth of feedack they had already reeived from the same source: that is ther instructor also provided feedback on leaners homework and other asignments in the course. This line f reasoning i further rflected in learners' responses to the survey question \*What did you learn from the emal exchange?" Notably, while allgroups received the same question, 8 of 15 learners in the PeerF Group referenced the fact that their

German proficiency improved (e.g., I gained a better understanding of word order and colloquial writing." - P108 or I learned how to express myself in written German better." - P113), whereas only 3 of 10 learners in the TeacherF Group provided comments along the same line. Instead, responses from leaners in the eacherF Group focused on cultural gains more so than gains in language or writing proficiency. What is more, leaner in the Telcollaoration Only Group who did not reiefedback even suggested this a ossible improvement of the email exchange ("Perhaps we could have ofered short corrections to one another? Maybe this isn't in the spirit of the exchange, but I dnt know if I sounded competen or whether I ws ll over the place. " - P301), which further demonstrates how valuable the email partner in the target country was to learners as a source for authentic feedback.3

Pedagogically speaking, the finding that CF--whether stemming from an email partner or an instructoris an effective tool to promote writing proficiency in teleollaboration is important. It shows that although telecollaboration alone can also beefit learners language skill (e.g., Satar & Ozdener, 2008; Schenker, 2016, 2017), gains are greater when CF is incorporated into the exchange It is then even more ecouraging to se that fdack from the email partners in the target country was particularl effective because this lessens the burden on intructors to provide feedback themselves. Our findings show that peer i a telecollaboratie setting can be a great source of feedback: on the one hand because learnersrelate to them differently and seem to strongly value their partners corrections resulting in a lasting effect on their L2 proficiency, on the other hand because teachers are generally grateful if their learners receive additional help without causing more work for themselves. As such, we cal for future telecollaboration projects which include an element of CF as part of the exchange to maximize benefits for the learners.

Finally, we would like to acknowledge some limitations of the present study and make suggestions for the design of future studies. First, the three groups in the present study were taught by three diferent instructors, two graduate students who were L2 peakers of German and one lector who was an 1 speaker of German.It is ossible that students whose teachers were 2 speakers i.. students in the PeerF and Telecollaboration Only Group) appreciated L1 interaction with their email partners more than students whose teacher was an L1 speaker (i.e., students in the TeacherF Group). To avoid possible teacher efects in future telcollaboration studies, researchers could randomly assign individual students to a condition (i.e., Peer CF, Teacher CF, or Telecollaboration Only) instead of assigning entire classes to a condition, which was the case in the present study. Second, the sample size in the present study was relatively smal, ranging from 10-15 participants per group. However, this limitation was attenuated by the use of robust stistc for the analyses. That is, by resampling 1o,oo times, bootstrapping allowed us to simulate a much larger data set, simulating participant numbers in the thousands, and thus making the findings of the present study more reliable. Third, the present study was designed to only investgate the effctiveness of written feedback on L2 writing proficiency. Some telecollobarative exchanges only include asynchronous, written modes of communicatio, simply because different target languages sometimes come with a difference in time zones and leaners cannot be expected to communicate synchronously. Nevertheles, Gen-Z learners in college classrooms are so used to synchronous communication tools (e.g., Zoom/Skype) as well as asynchronous tools that allow for oral communication (e.g., Whatsapp, Flipgrid) that they increasingly wish for other modes of communication than written correspondence. We saw this in our study in survey responses such as I would like to skype/zoom my partner next time, it would be more beneficial - P308. Therefore, future studies could investigate the effectiveness of written or oral CF on other L2 competencies as well, such as speaking proficiency or vocabulary development. Finall, the present study did not sses the retention of gains in writing proficiency over an extended period of time. That is, the DIALANG pre- and posttes provided a somewhat delayed assessment because it spanned an entire semester and some corrections occurred at the very beinning of the semester, nevertheles, future studies could atempt to include an assessment several weeks or even months after the end of the telecollaborative exchange, to asses ong-term retention of learning benefits.

# 7. Conclusion

The goal of the present study was to examine whether corrctive feedback can promote writing proficiency during tele. collaboration, specificall, during a semester-long email exchange. Moreover, the study compared th effectiveness f fedback from email partners to feedback from an instructor. Results showed that feedback played a crucial role: students who received feedack improved their writing proficiency over the course of the semester, and, interestingly, feedack from email partners was even more effective than feedback from an instructor. Importantly, students who received no fedback did not improve their writing proficiency, even though they also participated in the email exchange. This finding underscores Godwin-Jones' (2019) observation that learning gains resulting from telecollaboration are \*by no means automatic" and that \*exchanges need to be st up [..] with an awareness of best practices (p. 8). Corrective feedback is one of those best practices. To maximize leaning gains during telecollaboration, we call for more telecollaboration research that systematically incorporates feedback into virtual exchanges.
