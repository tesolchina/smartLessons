# ABSTRACT

English language teaching (ELT) methods have evolved throughout time but to what extent are teachers aware of it? Most of Non-native English teachers in Colombia might work under conditions of taking English native speakers as the ‘only models’ to use when teaching English in the classroom, ignoring new tendencies or getting stuck in time since they learned English in the same way they teach it now. In this line of new tendencies and with the need of developing abilities for the insertion into the globalized world, some private schools in Cali have adopted approaches that favor global citizenship education. Nevertheless, English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) is not highly mentioned in their training private sections. So, what are the non-native teachers’ perspectives on teaching English as a Lingua Franca and how these perspectives are related to actual teaching practice in educating global citizens? The purpose of this study was to identify, explore and critically assess the non-native teachers’ perspectives towards ELF and how they are linked to ELT and global citizenship education. This paper reports a study done with 10 Non-native English teachers from a private school in Cali, Colombia. The present research exposed findings where non-native teachers at this school showed certain conflict when adopting ELF approach and preferred applying the rules of standard English. It was also found how these teachers applied many strategies in class to facilitate the promotion of global citizenship. This study displays analysis regarding ELF use in the classroom that can be possibly used in similar scholar contexts, and also produced a set of recommendations that may have certain implications in the ELT field, teacher training and global citizenship education for schools that are on this trend.

Key Words: English as a Lingua Franca (ELF), Non-native English teachers, Global citizenship education, English as Native Language (ENL), perspectives.

# Non-native English teachers’ perspectives on teaching English as a Lingua Franca in a bilingual school in Cali.

In the world of language teaching a variety of methods, approaches, strategies, and techniques have been implemented in the classroom. Some of them easy come, easy go. Others, on the contrary, are here to stay and another group of them are mixed or merged. The question is which one shall we take? Something arguably and debatable to be answered. Nevertheless, the new tendencies in teaching English to promote the development of certain skills such as critical thinking, intercultural communication, collaboration, and creativity are on the way. These abilities permeate everything an individual does on daily-basis human interaction. Among all the educational options to adopt, teaching English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) is on the table. More than a method or anything similar, it is the possibility to see the world of Englishes differently; not only from students’ perspectives but mainly from non-native teachers’ perspectives, who must raise awareness on the post-modern globalization as part of language acquisition/learning along with the intention of educating students to be Global Citizens. ELF is in Jenkins’ (2014, p. 44) definition “English as it is used as a contact language among speakers from different first languages” or in Seidlhofer’s (2011, p. 25) “any use of English among speakers of different first languages for whom English is the communicative medium of choice, and often the only option”. Despite the fact that it is difficult to know the real number of English Speakers around the world, it is true that Non-native users of the language outnumber the Native ones. As seen in The History of English web page, Martin (2011) says:

English is the second or third most popular mother tongue in the world, with an estimated 350-400 million native speakers. But, crucially, it is also the common tongue for many non-English speakers the world over, and almost a quarter of the globe's population - maybe 1½-2 billion people - can understand it and have at least some basic competence in its use, whether written or spoken.

This is an indicator that the majority of the worldwide English transactions and its variations are done nowadays by people from different countries, different cultures, and different academic backgrounds making of it a Lingua Franca.

Canagarajah (2007, p. 924) stated that “ELF belongs to a virtual speech community in which the speakers of ELF are not located in one geographical boundary”. These speakers practice other languages and cultures in their own direct locations. Even though they do not live in a country where English is spoken as a first language, learners use ELF as shared resource to communicate attitudes, forms, and agreements to guarantee successful communication when interacting with other English speakers whose L1 is different. The recognition of ELF is understanding that learning and using a language goes beyond mere interchange of words, it is to perform strategically, having at hand situational resources and social negotiation skills to achieve fluid communication in different contexts. That is to say, bearing in mind that communicating in a foreign language has to do not only with language per se but also with culture and language practice. Therefore, the students of today must develop skills to blend in with the world's demands in a society that is under a never-ending construction; in other words, they must become a global citizen. Moreover, teachers ought to give enough opportunities for students to be able to mold their language to suit their needs for communication taking into account ELF as a shared resource when negotiating meaning.

Since English is a language that is mainly used in multilingual contexts mostly by non-native speakers, which are the main protagonists of the negotiation of communication, the instructors of this language should be conscious of the points mentioned above. Having said this, a set of questions comes to mind: to what extent are teachers aware of ELF as a concept? What are the non-native teachers’ perspectives and how are these perspectives related to actual practice of educating students as Global Citizens? To what extent and how do the ELF-aware teachers put ELF into practice in the classroom? Are non-native teachers aware of the implications of ELF in Language English Teaching? What are their beliefs on teaching English as a Lingua Franca?

The following research will focus on discovering the perspectives of Nonnative English teachers on teaching English as a Lingua Franca in a private school in Cali and the possible implications to educate students as Global Citizens. In connection to the concept of Global citizenship education, the intercultural-skill development is now part of any curriculum, it is even an international agreement as seen in one fragment of the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference), the intercultural skills formulated in the document of CEFR, Council of Europe (2001, p.104) includes:

 “The ability to bring the culture of origin and the foreign culture into relation with each other   
 Cultural sensitivity and the ability to identify and use a variety of strategies to contact those from other cultures The capacity to fulfill the role of cultural intermediary between one's own culture and the foreign culture and to deal effectively with intercultural misunderstanding and conflict situations   
 The ability to overcome stereotyped relationships”.

As many of the language interactions that take place in Europe are in Lingua Franca English, the designers of the CEFR seem to have been influenced by the debate about ELF to rethink their notions of how all language competences should be measured. Twenty years back or so, if language experts were asked about how to measure language competence of a non-native speaker, they would probably may have answered that it should have been done through contrasting and comparing non-native speaker’s competence against that of a native speaker. But now, because of the role of English in the world and the advance of ELF theory, it is found that communication is the key to be measured. That is to say, how well speakers perform in communicating. There is no need to highlight special communication acts of the native speakers but how a message is conveyed and how successful this language transaction is regardless their L1 (For Lingua Franca users).

So the debates around English have led to the shifting of people's ideas about how to measure language competence, and therefore to a redesign of the CEFR. Therefore, CEFR have recently been modified to take into account the concept of language competence, multiculturality and global citizenship as mentioned in CEFR with companion volume with new descriptors. (CEFR, Council of Europe, 2018):

The CEFR consists of far more than a set of language proficiency levels. As explained in the text, the CEFR broadens the perspective of language education in a number of ways, not least by its vision of the user/learner as a social agent, co-constructing meaning in interaction, and by the notions of mediation and plurilingual/pluricultural competences.

The modifications to the descriptors were done and explained in the foreword as “the frequent constant received requests to continue to develop aspects of the CEFR, particularly the illustrative descriptors of second/foreign language proficiency. Requests have been made to complement the original illustrative scales with descriptors for mediation, reactions to literature and online interaction, to produce versions for young learners and for sign languages, as well as to develop more detailed coverage in the descriptors for A1 and the C levels” (Council of Europe, 2018, p, 21). These changes must have also been done mainly influenced due to the necessity of de-centering the idea of the native speaker as the only language user and model. This means that since international interactions are done through ‘mediation’, which is actually a new aspect of these descriptors the CEFR and the communitive language activities (beyond the “four skills model”); the Council of Europe (2018) stressed on the need of including the $2 1 ^ { \mathsf { s t } }$ century skills, among them: Global Awareness, Multicultural Literacy and Humanitarianism. These skills cannot be encapsulated only in Native speakers’ abilities but in all the lingua franca users around the world (for the purpose of this study, ELF is the core of it). They highlight the concept of ‘mediation activities’ (cognitive mediation and mediating communication). That is why, the new descriptors scales include skills for new areas such as: online interaction, mediation and plurilingual and pluricultural competences; elements that are intrinsic to global citizenship.

Placing together all the aspects given above, it is essential to comprehend some of the concepts behind ELF and its possible implications in teaching English for educating global citizens.

# II. LITERATURE REVIEW AND THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

Out of the many languages in the world, the English Language is the most taught and spoken language in the world with a number 1,121 billion of users. Added to that, English language is the first language of internet, the second language of publishing, it is officially spoken in 51 countries and also it is spoken in more than 100 countries where English is used as a ‘non-native’ language according to ESL Language Studies Abroad webpage (2018). Therefore, it promotes the use of the concept of English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) as an essential tool for people to communicate effectively even though they belong to different linguistic backgrounds.

English Language users, nowadays, need to be able to communicate on a broader scale, with a larger variety of people. The up-to-date belief of English Language that is prevalent around the world has enticed many people to put forward the idea of English as a lingua franca. Many authors have discussed the importance of this matter (Canagarajah, 2007; Jenkins, 2015; House, 1999; Seidlhofer, 2011). Nonetheless, this seems to be a never-ending topic and many misconceptions have been aroused. For instance, the concept of English native language as if it were the only standard model to follow when learning and teaching a language or if ELF is permitted in class, this might hinder students from achieving high marks in international tests. In order to demystify previous notions, some authors (Canagarajah, 2007; Dewey, M, 2012; Jenkins, 2015; Seidlhofer, 2001; Zhang & Hu, 2008) discussed the importance of English variations, contexts and cultures. Since Colombia is culturally diverse, ELF is an alternative worth discussing for teachers to be aware of future modifications, decisions, and changes in the area of English Language Teaching (ELT). Throughout this paper different findings are presented in order to be able to identify the non-native teachers’ perspectives on teaching English as a Lingua Franca and how these perspectives are related to actual teaching practice in Global Citizenship Education.

# A. ENGLISH FOR GLOBAL CITIZENS

Educating for global citizenship deals with problematics of worldwide interdependence, divergences of cultures, social identities, recognition of people’s traditions, customs and the development of the intercultural dimension taking into account values such as respect, equity, democracy and otherness to become an intercultural speaker or mediator (Byram, Gribkova & Starkey, 2002). In order to understand what English for Global Citizens means, it is relevant to present the definitions of the concepts involved.

Although the concept of the “global citizen” is still under construction, let us see some definitions of what is to be a global citizen. An approximate elaboration might be according to Oxfom Education (2006, para,1) webpage: “A global citizen is someone who is aware of and understands the wider world - and their place it. They take an active role in their community, and work with others to make our planet more equal, fair and sustainable” or in the perspectives of The Global Citizens’ Initiative (2018, para, 1) webpage: “A global citizen is someone who sees himself or herself as being part of an emerging world community and whose actions help define this community’s values and practices”. This means that regardless of who and what the definition is, it is a must to educate students with a high sense of all the aspects given above. For learners to gain these intercultural competences, the need of a transversal language that transports these elements arose and for this sake, the most indicated language is English.

Let us see now how English may be taken as an asset when building global citizenship. Due to the fact that the English Language has been given a well-known status of Lingua Franca and that has been a fundamental part of Globalization, worldwide citizenship education is using this language as the vehicle for conveying the international message of union and community building. For instance, the concept of the Intercultural Dimension (ID) involves both ideas, global citizenship and English as a lingua franca. Byram et al (2002) propose a systematic overview and some practical advice for developing the Intercultural Dimension in language teaching. They start from the learners’ main needs such as specific language knowledge and skills in the grammar to the ability to use the language in socially and culturally proper ways. Moreover, they highlight that The Council of Europe's 'Common European Framework of Reference' took into account the major innovations in language teaching (Communicative Language Teaching Communicative Approach) to make emphasis on the importance of including the ID in the objectives of this pedagogical practice. The authors state that the essence of

ID is “to help language learners to interact with speakers of other languages on equal terms, and to be aware of their own identities and those of their interlocutors” (Byram et al., 2002, p. 4). By way of explanation, it is to expect that language learners become intercultural speakers not only in communicating information but in developing a human relationship with people of other languages and cultures, therefore, transforming themselves into cultural mediators.

# B. BECOMING A GLOBAL CITIZEN

Most people would say that learning English is needed for being better professionals, for traveling, for cultural reasons, or for building relationships. Nonetheless, not many would recognize the big impact that English causes. For instance, knowing English helps become more conscious, interconnect globally, and change the perception we have our ourselves in the world. On this line, English language has become the international language of business, diplomacy, and tourism, which as we learn it, the opportunity of meeting people from around the world increases. As per our feelings of mind-openness to new cultures, knowledge, information, experiences, and observations of the world, we will be able to unlock the unknown and life-altering potential of going beyond the language: Global Citizenship. Therefore, teachers nowadays should help: “keeping students informed about current events; developing critical thinking skills; providing information about the target society, including information about attitudes to certain phenomena; developing their understanding of civil society and its institutions; instilling attitudes of tolerance to otherness” (Sheehan, 2008) for students to become global citizens. Furthermore, it is relevant to mention that the CEFR included in the formulation of the intercultural skills: the ability to bring the culture of origin and the foreign culture into relation with each other; cultural sensitivity and the ability to identify and use a variety of strategies to contact those from other cultures; the capacity to fulfil the role of cultural intermediary between one’s own culture and the foreign culture and to deal effectively with intercultural misunderstanding and conflict situations; the ability to overcome stereotyped relationships (CEFR, 2001, p.104). Having said this, teachers can create strategies in class to promote Global Citizenship by using collaborative learning, active involvement and mutual respect. It is crystal clear that a last word has not been said about this matter, that is why; more opportunities need to be searched in terms of applying citizen education concepts, such as human rights, total participation of the citizens in society, and the understanding of differences taking into account that a common language is used (English as a lingua franca).

# C. ENGLISH AS A LINGUA FRANCA

To start with, Seidlhofer (2001) believes that although both globalization and English language are recognized nowadays essential for teaching, learning and communication, ELF, which is somehow part of the Global communication, goes to a direction that is frequently branded as unsuitable. This is still a debatable topic on the field of pedagogy since there is no deep linguistic research on this matter, which leads to having divergent experiences in the classroom regarding the use of specific norms; consequently, this makes it difficult for teachers to take a stance on whether or not to follow only native speaker’s norms. This affects non-native language users’ perceptions. On the other hand, English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) is conceived in the way this touches its users. For a more significant impact, there must be a possibility of another model for the teaching of ELF, which helps with the transformation of pedagogy and teacher education (Seidlhofer, 2001). For that reason, she proposes a corpus-based language description as a part of a feasible bigger project (the availability of data), which is an important aspect to bear in mind whenever ELF is implemented. By the time any decision is made, it is essential to include any relevant aspect that might change teaching practices, in this case, a ‘corpus’ that facilitates ELF learning and its use in and out of class.

In regards to teachers’ perspective, Paradowski, (2013) reviews the article Understanding English as a Lingua Franca by Seidlhofer (2011). Paradowski analyses Seidhofer’s ideas by highlighting that a long path has already been walked on when talking about the English Language as essential for global communication. Nevertheless, there still are certain misconceptions on how to approach this concept. There are important aspects of the possible implications of ELF in Language English Teaching. Among them, English native speaking models are important but not the main objective to reach. In addition, it is imperative to comprehend that the imitation of ‘standard’ or ‘real’ English might obstruct the preservation of nonnative's identity. Hence, it is relevant to believe that the purpose of ELF is to communicate efficiently regardless of its nature: native or non-native, which is achieved by the adaptive strategies of the agents involved in that act. Conversely, the promotion of critical awareness of the implications of teaching and applying ELF in the didactics and application, mainly, posts an undoubted argument for taking into account the old paradigms of language diversity, community, and competence, being worried about the processes of adoption, adaptation, and creativity in teaching practices and changing the mythification that effective communication can only be accomplished by reaching native speaker’s levels.

To widen the horizons on the concepts of ELF, Canagarajah (2007) states that there are different elements regarding research on English as a Lingua Franca based on questions by Firth and Wagner (1997) on the contrastive ideas between the non-native and the native speaker, the learner and the user, and the interlanguage and the target language, which reflect a predisposition towards what is natural, the form of the language and language acquisition. Language communication succeeds through performance strategies, situational resources, and social negotiations in fluid communicative contexts. These ideas on how language proficiency might fluctuate according to speakers’ adaptability and cultural awareness can be integrated on the basis of practice rather than looking for extreme variances in constructs. As per Canagarajah’s (2007) emphasis on the importance of understanding thoroughly the concept of language acquisition, taking into account how through this conception there are communities, communication, and definitions of language, which mold the way to proceed in class; language interaction may take another path, the path of transmitting not only words but emotions, feelings, thoughts, culture and the creation of new forms of codification/decodification to guarantee successful transactions. This invites us all to build new paradigms based on the up-to-date knowledge to reformulate teaching practices to comprehend better language acquisition and foster a more democratic context where transnational relations and multilingual communication take place as Canagarajah intended with his ideas.

Once the concept of ELF was discussed, it is necessary to disclose the impact on the pedagogy of English as a Lingua Franca research and theory in relation to language teacher education and development, which is a point of debate. Dewey (2012) talks about the possible factors that affect the way English is taught and how teachers have their own beliefs and assumptions on how to proceed in class. This is due to the lack of training or because of the misconception gained by teachers by experience, institutions where they worked at or even ‘role-model’ professors who gave them the wrong idea of idealizing certain way of proceeding in class as fact to follow in pedagogical terms. Among all the factors, the hardest to change is teachers' assumptions and beliefs even though there are constant efforts to involve teachers to be ELF‐aware in order to revise current methodologies and practices in context to improve and/or incorporate an ELF perspective into their teaching practices. In other words, it is to find the relationship between ELF research and current beliefs and practices among English language teachers as Dewey (2012) mentions. This should be an invitation to re-orientate teachers’ thoughts on language teaching, plurality, multiculturalism and culture literacy.

Throughout years of empirical research on English as a Lingua Franca, different theories have been raised. Nonetheless, Jenkins (2015) considers that a re-theorization in respect of this matter should be done. She proposes a new way to call ELF, English as a Multilingua Franca. First, understanding that English language variations are seen as a ‘mix’. Videlicet, English is not taken as only one language but a multilanguage where all communities and contexts are included. Second, recognizing that the native language of Non-native English users is always part of their interactions (L1 transfer- Language leakage), and thirdly, English as a Multilingua Franca comprises a reconsideration of the terms/notions of ‘multilingual repertoires’, ‘shared repertoires’, and ‘multilingual resources’. This re-theorization can be taken into account as a deck of cards to play whenever ELF becomes part of any curriculum. Logically, the context, students' needs, global citizenship, and teachers' perceptions must be part of the analysis at the moment of implementation.

Another author that has been concerned about EFL, teachers’ perspectives and the possible pedagogical implications is Blair (2017) who provides information of a study done regarding the impact of ELF perspectives on language teachers, who have wide experience, having a scope of attitudes and levels of consciousness in connection to their professional development and contexts. This study is appropriate to see how teachers perceive ELF impact in their teaching practices. Nonetheless, what is the level of awareness of these teachers? It can be measured somehow by their responses to what they know and what they do. The problem is that sometimes teachers’ beliefs do not match with their actual teaching practices not only because of not knowing how to match the latter but because of not believing in new trends or pedagogical implementations. Therefore, (Blair, 2017) says that educators are capable of or motivated for dealing with possible skepticism and also for putting into balance their perceptions between standard models of English language teaching and lingua franca goals in their practice, which is essential to have a more extended point of view regarding the appropriate use of ELF in education. After adding Blair’s ideas, it is crucial to remark that despite teachers having different perceptions about this topic, currently, they are discerning more and more, being engaged to it, even when casting doubts or giving their insights. Needless to say there is also some good news in regards to teachers’ attitudes. They can be influenced through exposure to ideas, reflection, and motivation towards action.

Not only the role of teachers’ perceptions on the use of ELF in global citizenship education is relevant for this discussion but also the role that the English Language plays in the sociolinguistic context of Lingua Franca (LF) around the world, which has been becoming widely known and emerging exponentially. Marr and English (2019) argue that English is different in certain ways and to a certain extent. They say English has a global reach and is unavoidably prone to be more spread than any other modern language as part of the group of ‘big’ modern languages. Swaan (2001, p. 5-6) calls it the “supercentral”, along with Arabic, Chinese, French, Russian and Spanish. This means that is a language that shares many characteristics with others which are used as Lingua Franca although used on a bigger scale. Despite the last fact, it does not mean that English possesses any ‘special qualities or characteristics’ but that this language plays a pre-eminent role in the world of today. Consequently, having said the latter, many factors affect teachers’ perceptions for both the use of ELF and Global Citizenship Education. Some teachers may see ELF as something positive while some others as something negative at the moment of learning the English language.

Regarding teachers’ attitudes Soruc (2015) says that after analyzing how the number of English Language users from a wide variety of contexts has increased rapidly recently, it was necessary to distinguish English as a Native Language (ENL) and ELF, which leads to the constant debate of which one to use in language teaching in ‘expanding circle’ (Kachru, 1992) contexts (ELF vs ENL). Soruc found important data after doing research about teachers’ perspectives from these contexts. The results showed a strong preference for ENL norms by Non-native teachers. Despite this idea, it was also found that there is a higher recognition of the ELF and that this concept needs more study; that is to say, to have a bigger number of non-native teachers’ data, since the majority of the English Language users inhabit the expanding circle, for having a more accurate perspective towards ELF for future research.

Added to the line of discussion given above, Schmitz (2012) argues for more open-minded perspective towards this problem (ELF vs ENL) and for bearing in mind the new state of affairs of ELF in today’s globalized world. The dichotomy of using ENL or ELF norms in ELT is still alive. There are teachers who believe that using only ELF in the classroom might hinder students’ language proficiency. For instance, if a student wants to be certified in his/her language level by an international test administrator, his/her results will be affected by showing evidence of the incorrect use of the third singular person (she work_). The lack of the S in the sentence goes against the ENL norms, which demonstrates grammar awareness issues. On the contrary, there are educators who believe that raising awareness of the existence of ELF will guarantee better language transactions, understanding and message conveying during multicultural interactions. The inclusion in ELT of either ENL or ELF is still under discussion.

To narrow this down, Macias (2010) explores the features of ELF as an alternative to ELT in Colombia. There is still a big misconception of how ELF might not help students improve their English proficiency unless the English language model comes from a native speaker. Recently, The English Teaching Fellowship Program (Colombia Bilingue, 2016) implementation in Colombia shows in one of its principles the importance of recognizing the “Englishes” around the world, their accents and multiple cultures. Many of these teachers came from countries were English is spoken but is not their native language. They were brought and to eyes of the people in Colombia, they were native speakers too. Many parents and students saw these teachers as Native language users, therefore, as great models, which was a problem since many of these teachers (not all of them) had poor pedagogical background and experience. Little did they know what teaching in our context was, what students’ backgrounds were, their needs, their interests. These teachers were placed in the public field, where unfortunately, students have poor access to highquality education and also their parents lack of studying experience and opportunities. These parents were not contextualized on the importance of this program nor the students. Unluckily, we missed the opportunity to make of this program implementation a possibility of raising awareness of the use of ELF in class. So, what is the role of English language in our country? Macias (2010) focused on the role played by English in the country and on what models have been offered to the teaching of English as the program mentioned before. Based on this, he suggests a more international dimension to the teaching of English in Colombia in order to attempt the reduction of the use of Inner Circle varieties (Kachru, 1992) as the one and only model to follow that many people believe in, which in the end, is another point of discussion when educating citizens of the world and giving a place to ELF during this process.

# D. SOME FEATURES OF ELF

Numerous research projects have been done to identify the main features of ELF, the most advanced up to date is Vienna Oxford International Corpus of English (VOICE). Despite the fact that the project gives a wide perspective and comprehensible information, is still being studied from many diverse viewpoints by a group of professionals in this field. Seidlhofer (2004) focused on the lexicogrammatical features of ELF and reported some elemental features that have been identified so far. Recognizing that there are no reports yet of qualitative investigation, these findings might not be totally valid and reliable. Seidlhofer (2004, p. 220) extracted some of the errors that are seen as unproblematic for communicative success and are not considered extremely needed for conveying messages successfully:

¨Dropping the third person present tense –s Confusing the relative pronouns who and which Omitting definite and indefinite articles where they are obligatory in ENL, and inserting them where the do not occur in ENL   
Failing to use correct forms in tag questions (e.g., isn’t it? or no? instead of shouldn’t they?) Inserting redundant prepositions, as in We have to study about…) Overusing certain verbs of high semantic generality, such as do, have, make, put, take Replacing infinitive-constructions with that-clauses, as in I want that   
Overdoing explicitness (e.g. black color rather than just black)¨.

On the other hand, the latest wave in ELF studies (e.g. Jenkins 2015) puts less emphasis on linguistic features and more on ELF as a set of creative language (practices), including negotiation of meaning, adaptation to the interlocutor's level of competence, ‘multilingual’ repertoire and ‘shared’ resources. This refers to the elements non-native speakers recur as the interaction takes places. (resources that are discovered due to the need of communication). Some ELF researchers, mainly those who are in pragmatic competence, linguistic awareness, and intercultural awareness; contemplate the emergent nature of ELF to obtain information from it to find why and how, negotiation and co-construction communication happens during ELF interactions.

# E. TEACHING ENGLISH LANGUAGE- ELF VS ENL

Teaching English language has been a task that evolves throughout time. A historical review can be done to recall all the methods, techniques and strategies implemented in class to achieve language-learning objectives. Nonetheless, what is certain is that English today is recognized as a lingua franca as mentioned above. As part of the circumstances for the purpose of this project is needed to show the counter-argumentation to decide whether to use English as a native language (ENL) or English as lingua franca (EFL) in the classroom.

Some researchers are in favor of using ENL in the classroom. Kuo (2006) states that native speakers work as full and convenient models to attain social and cultural behaviors. This means, that teaching English by native speakers will help students comprehend better native speakers’ modes of conduct. Therefore, traditions and customs showed by a native teacher enhances students’ possibilities of learning better the language. Another researcher (O'Regan, 2014) says that the best option is ENL since this language has been well-studied and shows a natural evolution throughout time. Teaching ENL permits students acquire a real language that has wide background and culture. On the contrary, believing in the ‘ELF movement’ can be risky. Moreover, ELF is not consistent and lacks theorization.

On the other hand, there are other authors who are in favor of giving ELF the right to be part as an option for communication for both native and non-native speakers not only in the world but in the classroom. For example, Canagarajah (2007), Jenkins (2015), House (1999), Seidlhofer (2011) who exposed different perspective about the importance of ELF for global communication and for learning/teaching practices. They also invite to go for further research to elaborate theoretical ideas that raise awareness on the use of ELF in teaching communities worldwide. Some of their perceptions are given in this study in the theoretical framework above.

# F. NON-NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS (ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEACHERS)

The best teacher is neither the native nor the non-native speaker, but the individual who can help students realize the importance of relationships between their culture and another. Furthermore, the best teachers are those who can help their pupils acquire interest in and inquisitiveness about ‘otherness’, and awareness of who they are, where they belong to from their own perspectives, as well as other people's points of view (Byram et al, 2002). This means, that there should be a recognition that one thing is to believe that just by being a native speaker, that makes this teacher better than others, or on the contrary, the prejudice and misconception that people from the different circles have (mainly, the expanding circle) regarding a non-native speaker's teaching abilities. People tend to fall into the lack of language competence as bad teaching and high language competence as good teaching. Perhaps, this can be understood if a balance between specific competences, pedagogical knowledge, and linguistic knowledge (regardless of the teacher’s mother-tongue) is found. In fact, what is key is help develop the intercultural competence to empower students with elements they need for global interaction.

Transforming teaching practices and enabling students to interact worldwide must start, then, from being aware that most English language use in the world is actually lingua franca. Marr & English (2019, p. 60) say that the “use of ELF is something which has the potential radically to transform classroom practice – but only if teachers are prepared…teachers simply need to understand and be able to respond to it… today’s ELT professionals need to be specialists in language: and this necessarily includes having some understanding of the sociolinguistics of Lingua Francas and language spread. How can you teach the world’s lingua franca effectively if you don’t understand how lingua francas work?” Non-native English language teachers are invited not only to become aware of the latter but also to grow in sociolinguistics and pedagogical knowledge to be more than just non-native teachers. Therefore, an ‘expert’ of the language and a bridge between culture and communication by understanding the importance of lingua francas.

# G. MOVING AWAY FROM THE NATIVE SPEAKER

Experienced non-native teachers in Colombia are always working behind the shadow of reaching ‘perfection’ in their foreign language use. Describing perfectionism as having a nativelike accent and an accurate language usage at the moment of being role models in their teaching practices. Apparently, most of them believe they can be better teachers if they reach that native-like level. This group of teachers feels more comfortable if they are acknowledged in their educational contexts with a native-like accent. For instance, some might say: “I have a British accent" or "I learned English in New York, that is why I speak like that". Not only teachers but also students and parents classify these teachers as the most suitable ones for their language learning process. This conception has been part of our context for many years. It has been a paradigm that turned out to be a reality or even an undeniable and unchangeable truth. Fortunately, many more are seeing the world differently. Some educators are now taking master’s degrees or training courses where they can find alternative perspectives of what being a non-native English teacher is and how this affects their pupils’ learning experience.

English language owes a global status today, according to Sari & Yusuf (2009) English is apparently learned most likely to communicate with people who use it as their additional language (non-native speakers). For instance, “the likelihood for an English learner in Iran to travel to Dubai and have a casual conversation in English with Arab salespersons is absolutely much higher than travel to the US or the UK” (Sari & Yusuf, 2009, p. 50). Consequently, stereotyping native English users as the only interlocutors for English apprentices seems to be wrong taking into account that the number of individuals learning and using English is growing more and more, therefore, the variety of ‘accents’ and Englishes as well.

Coming across with native speakers to have successful conversations may give a surprise for those who did not have much interaction with them but only with non-native ones; realizing that their quest for having a ‘native accent’ - as a nonnative English language user - was, in fact, a problem. The idea of acquiring a 'native accent' is that learners believe there is only one; a ‘standard’ English. They do not want e.g. a Scottish or Alabama or rural accent - they actually want a ‘prestige’ native accent - which of course many teachers don't have - though the learners often don't realize this (Cook, 1999). This may lead English learners to be lost in translation, get into misunderstandings, frustration and unsuccessful culture and communication transactions. Shall we keep only ‘standard’ English or ‘English as native language’ as the best model to follow in ELT? What ‘accent’ do students need to learn? What is the recognition of English variations or English as a lingua franca? These questions can be part of the constant reflection language teachers (native and nonnative teachers) must have to improve their ELT.

On the other hand, in order to move away from the native speaker in ELT, another argument is given by Cook (1999). He argues that ELT can be benefited if we pay attention also to non-native teachers rather than concentrating merely on the native speaker. He suggests possible ways in which non-native users can be used as models and also how we can exploit our students’ L1. He says that L2 users differ from monolingual native speakers since their knowledge of L2 and L1 affects their cognitive processes. That is to say, there must be an understanding of the differences between L2 users and native speakers as language teachers. It does not mean that one is better than the other but highlighting their virtues to facilitate students' learning processes, mainly the L2 users'. Additionally, L2 users should be recognized in and out of the classroom by giving them the status they deserve as speakers in their own right. Also, there must be an understanding of L2 users are multicompetent and of they are not an imitation of native speakers. On the other hand, “some native speakers cannot change their native language any more than they can change who brought them up. Also, they are not aware of their knowledge in a formal sense and nor could they explain how they ride a bicycle” (Cook, 1999, p. 186). This means some native teachers lack of training and despite this fact, they are hired and used and idealized as the role model to follow. Are they the only models to follow for both Language users and Language Teachers? Definitely, both non-native and native speakers can be used as language models and also as English language teachers once they are properly trained ad hoc. Hence, regarding the importance of having proper models in language teaching, here is when the concepts of ELF and Global Citizenship Education become more significant.

Apropos the importance of recognizing the role of L2 users in teaching practices, their multicompetence and the political role of native-based models in language teaching, it is fundamental to be persuasive about the point of acknowledging that learning a second/foreign language is more than acquiring a language. It goes along with mental development and all the processes that are involved. In other words, there is an implicit concept of internal goals in teaching, which goes beyond the ability of communicating; actually, it affects exponentially the mind in many ways. That is why there must be a quest for increasing social skills and decision making processes when interacting within known or unknown contexts or other cultures to develop an intercultural dimension; to 'move away from the native speaker’.

# H. CONCLUSION

Transformations of the world of ELT can be done not only from the conception of what type of English language to teach (ENL or ELF) but also, from the provision of tools for students to become Global citizens. Today’s English language transactions happen more often among non-native speakers around the world as mentioned above. Therefore, it requires the agents involved to develop skills that go beyond the language itself due to the necessity of conveying messages effectively. By ways of explanation, the intercultural communication skill. English language users must have ‘reading’ skills of cultural facts. That is to say, at the moment of communication, the speaker ought to scan his/her interlocutor by listening to intonation, pronunciation, way of thinking and language style. This gives aid for the speaker to think critically to find ways to negotiate and collaborate with each other creatively in order to signify their exchange of words according to each individual’s needs. This not only takes place in face-to-face conversations but through the web.

Since globalization is part of our daily lives, internet has been the new bridge of communication and right there is where English plays a great role. Whenever people communicate through the internet, people need to learn to negotiate meaning, understand differences and recognize that there are English variations that affect message interaction. When people exchange meaning via internet, the gap between what is written and what is spoken gets closer; the speech become similar to the writing production, which happens at different levels depending of many factors, one of them is when a person is learning how to speak and write a second language. ELF can be the best option to choose to guarantee effective communication. In spite of the fact that there are extreme positions towards the use of ELF in English classes, some of them are ELF favoring and ELF dissenting voices, some reasoned and others not so (Schmitz, 2012); teachers and students’ goals might surpass these positions as per the need of global communication and social interaction. Throughout this research the importance of teaching English for global citizenship and the conception of Non-native speakers as language teachers are relevant to assess the level of awareness English Language teachers (native and no-native) have and the possible implications for their teaching practices.

# IV. METHODOLOGY

# A. CONTEXT

This study took place at a bilingual school in Cali, Colombia. Berchmans School is located to the south area in Pance, Cali, Valle del Cauca. This bilingual private school was founded in 1933. Nowadays it has around 1650 students, who are classified as to a medium-high social strata. The education in school is divided into pre-school, elementary and high school. It’s co-educative and it is part of the International Company of Jesus, in Colombia is part of the network of schools ACODESI. English Language classes are from 5 to 6 hours weekly, 3 hours or Computer Science and 3 of Science. They also have extracurricular activities where they have the chance to study French. Regarding teachers, there are around 130, out of them, 29 are English Language Teachers and 10 of them are located in high school. None of them are "native" teachers, which makes them the best option to find out what perceptions they have on teaching English as a Lingua Franca.

Throughout time the common belief that native English teachers were the best models to have in class has taken non-native teachers to a lower profile; being underpaid or even ‘relegated’ to lower grades because they do not ‘pronounce’ well. A misconception that is still alive. On the other hand, because of the constant transformation of the world’s society (globalization), many schools include Global Citizenship in their curriculums and Berchmans school is no exception. That is why, nowadays the implementation of the IB program (Diploma)1 is on the way, which is looking for international mindedness.

# B. PARTICIPANTS

Berchmans School English Language teachers usually are between 28 and 60 years old, most of them hold a C1 level according to the CEFR and $7 5 \%$ of them have a major in Foreign Languages by Universities, the other $2 5 \%$ are certified as English teachers but with a different university major, none of them have a master’s degree in language teaching nor specialization in pedagogy. Most of them finished their studies more than 10 years ago. 10 Non-native English teachers who teach in the secondary section were chosen for this research. For an initial research of this kind is not needed to include the following variable of possible criteria: specific age or years of experience.

Since this study is focused on Non-native teachers’ perceptions, participants were selected within this parameter. Only high school is part of the research to make the sample manageable. Most of these teachers have been working at this school for more than 5 years, therefore, they are familiarized with the philosophy of the institution. This philosophy demands from English language teachers a minimum knowledge of and the use of the Communicative Approach and the text analysis. These factors might give teachers elements for them to guarantee enough interaction among students for speaking production, as well as to help students develop reading abilities to make analysis and inter-textualization.

Teachers at this school are under training sessions for the comprehension of the IB program implementation. English language teachers who are part of this $1 0 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ and $1 1 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ -grade team must be certified as IB teachers. That is to say, they must be applying at this moment, modifications to their marking period plans in order to do the right transition to reach the IB diploma standards. In the main objective of IB learner profile, “the aim of all IB program is to develop internationally minded people who, recognizing their common humanity and shared guardianship of the planet, help to create a better and more peaceful world” (International Baccalaureate, 2006).

The latter indicates the importance of forming students to be global citizens and that teachers at this school must know the implications of this type of education.

# C. TYPE OF RESEARCH

Since the combination of different research methods have been beneficial from certain studies as per Rossman & Wilson’s (1985, p.627) ideas who said that “some sort of integration of two research methodologies can ‘corroborate’ (provide convergence in findings), elaborate (provide richness and detail), or initiate (offer new interpretations) findings from another method”, a descriptive, analytical and qualitative research is chosen for this study. Due to the fact that a subjective interpretation of the data is needed and a description of the information as well, this research is mainly characterized as qualitative, which seeks to understand human behavior from the frame of reference of the person acting, that is, from within, emphasizing the subjectivity of those who deliver the data (Dörnyei, 2015). Descriptive, analytical and qualitative research intends to answer questions about who, what, where, when, and to what extent things happen in a specific context and as per the nature of the context, people and settings’ demands of this study, this is the best option. This research also intends to identify, describe and analyze conceptions, variations in populations through the creation of measurement tools. Such as, questionnaires, interviews, observation formats, etc. This type of study (descriptive, analytical and qualitative) plays a critical role in education research in particular (Loeb et al., 2017).

# D. PROCEDURE

By means of identifying the non-native teachers’ perspectives on teaching English as a Lingua Franca and how these perspectives are related to actual teaching practice in educating global citizens, which is the main objective of this study, I consider to proceed in three stages. First of all, obtaining teachers’ general perception of the topic is needed. This stage will give a big picture or the state of affairs to have an initial point from where to describe and analyze teachers’ positions towards ELF and global citizenship education. The data collection tools for this stage are a survey and a group interview. Moreover, at this stage, as the data analysis process is frequently referred to as open since the researcher can make any extra questions of any comments that might be worthy to explore (Merrian, 2009), the group interview will be an essential element to identify the main purpose for this study. Second, through a class observation, teachers were observed in their teaching practices to describe and analyze their possible implementation of the main features of ELF and global education to enhance the quality of information obtained in the previous stage. A check-up list form was used for this purpose. And thirdly, a juxtaposition was done to see how both teachers' perceptions and actions in the classroom encounter to fulfill with the primary and main objective mentioned above.

# STAGE 1: GENERAL PERCEPTIONS IDENTIFICATION

In order to identify Non-native teachers’ beliefs are on Teaching English as a Lingua Franca and its implications, this stage is divided into four steps.

# Step 1:

Have teachers take a survey that contains specific statements regarding teaching ELF by using the Likert scale, which measures attitudes and behaviors using response options that go from one extreme to the other (for example, very unlikely to most likely).

# Step 2

Once the survey is answered, the information will be organized to classify the scale of knowledge teachers have about teaching ELF and Global citizenship education.

# Step 3

A group discussion with teachers from high school with different English Teaching academic background and different English proficiency levels was hold to confirm the generalities of teachers’ perceptions towards teaching ELF and Global Citizenship Education in contrast to what they responded in the survey. This step was described and analyzed in full discussion as the core of this research.

# STAGE 2: GLOBAL CITIZEN EDUCATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ELF EVIDENCE

Since school where the study took place intends to educate students to become citizens of the world, it would be a great asset to see how teachers’ perceptions on ELF and global citizenship education are implemented in class. A format was created to check throughout class observation the elements that composed the main topics of discussion in this study. Therefore, to describe how teachers approach teaching English to educate students as Global Citizens and EFL use. This stage helped complementing the main analysis done in stage 1.

# STAGE 3: PERCEPTIONS VS CLASS PRACTICE/OBSERVATION JUXTAPOSITION

In this part of the research all the information obtained through the interviews, group discussion and observations was juxtapositioned to teachers’ actual practice to determine if non-native teachers are aware of the implications of ELF in Language English Teaching.

# E. DATA COLLECTION TECHNIQUES

Survey: this tool was applied by using the Likert Scale, which is focused on obtaining information about behavior and attitudes towards a certain topic. Since looking for Non-native English teachers' perceptions and beliefs, understanding their feelings and emotions on this matter facilitates the comprehension on how they got to those conclusions. 10 teachers from high school will be sent an email for them to answer the questions in the documents in order to do further statistics and analysis.

Focus Group and face-to-face (closed) interviews: On the first hand, focus groups are indeed the best way to exchange viewpoints and discuss agreements or disagreements between interviewees. On the other hand, an interview permits to go much deeper, in particular thanks to a lengthier speaking time. More insights are likely to be collected, which are useful for the later analysis of data. Both activities were carried out throughout a group meeting given by school bilingual coordinator. Specific group of questions were generated to collect this information.

Observations: In order to develop comprehension into the language and teaching context, the environment, events, activities, interactions, language used etc. This tool aims to spot out issues or confirming hypothesis of class practices. A check-up list form was created to collect data that permits a better description and analysis between the information obtained from the survey and from the interviews.

# V. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS

As mentioned above, this study involves different stages in which 10 nonnative English language teachers from the high school section in a bilingual school in Cali were asked to respond a survey, were part of a group interview and then 4 of them were observed and interviewed to juxtaposition their answers and their actual teaching practice regarding the use of ELF and Global citizenship education. In this section the analysis to the findings obtained from the different data collection tools and techniques is done in order to identify the non-native teachers’ perspectives on teaching English as a Lingua Franca and how these perspectives are related to actual teaching practice in educating global citizens. The results to each stage were described and analyzed in order to provide information from the their initial and general perceptions to their specific stances towards ELF and global citizenship education, and their actions in class through the group interview and observation method.

# STAGE 1: GENERAL PERCEPTIONS IDENTIFICATION

# Steps 1 and 2

To start with, a group of questions (12) were created for identifying initial teachers' perceptions on what ELF is, some of its features, global citizenship promotion in class, accent and among others. These questions were sent through institutional email and drive, Google documents tool was used for this purpose.

In a macro analysis, we can see that the majority of the teachers had previous knowledge in regards with the concepts of ELF and Global citizenship education. It seems that they also include activities to promote aspects that lead to be a global citizen. On the contrary, some of them might not know clearly how ELF works or how to implement the use of this concept in class. Let us see the questions and the percentages according to degrees of agreement (Likert scale- see table 1).

As mentioned before, teachers at this school are under training on the aspects and the development of what being an International student. The school has offered training sessions were the profile of the IB student contains features of global citizenship education and also before that, teachers were trained by the use Projectbased learning in their classes. The school asked teachers to work on the development of elements that promote citizenship, values and social skills. Perhaps, this is why questions 1, 2 and 3 have high percentages of agreement.

For the questions 4, 5 and 6, teachers see a real connection between ELF and Global citizenship education. Nevertheless, only $60 \%$ of them have a clear definition of what ELF is. I think that since most of these teachers have not been exposed to new teaching tendencies or they have not recently taken any university language teaching certification after their undergraduate studies, teachers might have had poor exposure to new theoretical findings in ELF. other $80 \%$ of teachers believe that if they use ELF in their classes, their students will improve their language abilities to be global citizens. If we take language abilities as all the possibilities for an individual to communicate successfully, negotiate meaning, understand culture differences; we may say that this is certainly true due to the fact that international language transactions not only help building communication but relationships, this last fact is one of the characteristics of worldwide citizenship education, the development of the Intercultural Dimension, (Byram et al, 2002).

For the rest of the questions, which are linked to ELF features, teachers have different general perceptions some high percentages of agreement for question 9 but a fluctuation for question 10 and 12. As per the comprehension of English variations in question 11, there is more clarity that teachers understand this point as part of ELF. Nevertheless, there are some teachers that responded in disagreement to some of these questions. They can be due to lack of information on this topic or of possible misconceptions.

# Steps 3 and 4

# TEACHERS’ PERSPECTIVES ON ENGLISH AS A LINGUA FRANCA AND TEACHERS’ PRACTICES TO EDUCATE GLOBAL CITIZENS.

After seeing general teachers’ perceptions, the same number of teachers were asked to attend a meeting where 5 questions, regarding the topics of Global citizenship and ELF, were set. Teachers were recorded as they answered question by question. In this step, the most relevant answers were analyzed in order to inquire what teachers’ beliefs are on teaching ELF, to describe how teachers approach teaching English to educate global citizens and to show to what extent and how the ELF-aware teachers put ELF into practice in the classroom.

# How do you define English as a Lingua Franca (ELF)?

Most of the teachers said that ELF is a language that is shared by people who are not native speakers. Nevertheless, there are two answers that caught my attention. The following answer does not totally appeal to the definitions given above by Jenkins (2014) or Seidlhofer (2011). The first answer is:

“OK, language use in an authentic environment…OK. For… er.. everyday communication not only for communicative skills, communicative purposes … but also, for an academic setting”.

Maybe this teacher has an idea of what ELF is but did not touch the key point of what ELF is, plus, to place ELF only in academic settings seems to be closer to ENL or ‘standard English’ rather than English variations and else. On the contrary, the second answer is:

“It’s a language used to communicate among people that English is not their first language”.

This answer is similar to the many other answers given by the rest of the teachers and ensembles easily to the main aspects that makes English a lingua franca. The latter gives a global perception that a big percentage of teachers in high school know what EFL is.

#  Do you include in your classes ELF? If so, how?

Teachers say they include ELF in their classes by having their students listen to English variations, allowing transference, accepting students’ mistakes when communicating (mainly during speaking activities) to avoid interruption. Seidlhofer (2004) highlighted some of the errors/mistakes that might not cause difficulties for successful communication. Some of the teachers might be permitting some of these errors/mistakes production in class to promote communication or even ELF use. For instance, one of the interviewees responded like this:

“Although I don’t include ELF in my classes as I am teaching students to become B2 or C1 in their language, it is impossible not to have it within the class as students use it..ehh… and… use expressions from literal translations from Spanish to English and also through body language and also through expressions that they consider can be used in English – although they are not necessarily correct – but the information is got and the communication is not interrupted”.

This teacher is aware of the existence of ELF. Furthermore, the teacher accepts transference and translanguaging but is worried for ENL standards since students are to be certified in their English proficiency as B2 and C1 levels. There is degree of acceptance of ELF to keep students' production, nevertheless, the teacher aims to reach English high standards for students and believes that ELF will not permit to get to the expected levels. I think that more than just permitting ELF use, it is to create an environment where English is not seen as a language that is fixed, that is norms are rigid and due to that fact, only taking standards use as the only way to guarantee communication. Another teacher responded by focusing on English variations, which is one of the features of ELF.

“I try to combine Englishes…mmm… and one way to do this is by having students listen to different accents from different countries, from people whose English is not their first language…”

Having student be exposed to English variations will allow students to be aware of the importance of recognizing different Englishes around the world; they are not produced only by native speakers but also by non-native ones, known as the expanding circle, mentioned by Kachru (1992). This generates a different perspective in students, which enhances comprehension of lexical use, differences in pronunciation (regional) and language interpretation according to cultures and places.

# What do you think the implications of using ELF in class are?

Teachers agree on the importance of global interaction, exposure to different accents, cultures and the different ways people communicate with each other. Using ELF in class implicates that students will improve their fluency, mainly in low levels since they feel free to speak without being constantly interrupted. Moreover, ELF in class lowers students’ affective filter as they feel more comfortable, motivated and satisfied once they see their messages come across effectively. These are some of the teachers’ positions towards this question:

“…for students to face more real world, …eh… more authentic conversations because then, when they go and interact with real people they are going to be able to understand with others due to being exposed to different accents, different cultures, and…and different ways of expressing in English”.

“I think first of all, it is for the teacher to have a clear understanding of what ELF is about and also understanding the sociocultural context where the teaching/learning practice is taking place”.

These points of view give a glance of what teachers’ perceptions are regarding the use of ELF and the implications that come along with it. Definitely, teachers have point of common thoughts. They believe that teachers need to know what ELF is first before actually knowing how to modify their teaching practices. Furthermore, they need to have supplementary material for promoting authentic English variations, which in teachers’ voices they are linked to sociocultural aspects. Finally, the recognition of English as a native language and as a lingua franca; their differences in teaching/learning practices, as well as the suitable strategies applied in class according to pedagogical needs, context and culture.

#  How do you approach teaching English to educate Global citizens?

Teachers think that to educate global citizens it is necessary to work with realia, real texts that contain information about worldwide sociopolitical and environmental problems for students to make comparisons of cultures and traditions. Analyzing these problems and cultures with an open mind and with a critical view give students the opportunity of creating possible solutions within class. Furthermore, acknowledging the importance of connections and relationship building regardless the country where they are born. Teachers say they recognize that for being a global citizen, students must develop $2 1 ^ { \mathsf { s t } } .$ -century competences, which allow their pupils to build bridges with rest of the world. This can be done not only through artificial exposure in the classroom but also through the use of technology tools. Some answers are:

“Definitely through the cultural aspects. When you understand the culture or the cultural dynamics that work in an English speaking country or in a Spanish speaking country, then, language is going to be easier to attain as they can contrast it to traditions, to ways of doing things, differently from the ways we do it normally in our context”.

"Having students familirize… be familiarized with different cultures and through that, making them understand the greatness of diversity to enrich students’ own beliefs”

“…mmm… I think that…well… teaching English will help students to build bridges with other citizens from around the world, so I think that it’s important to design activities that involve $2 1 ^ { \mathsf { s t } } .$ -century competences that are going to enable them to face society and that it also includes changing the way that evaluation is done."

Teachers are aware of the main aspects that promote global citizenship education. Notwithstanding, there are aspects that need to be unified for teachers not to try to do it but actually, implementing strategies that establish minimum parameters or standards to reach in class. This is done already through the project and task-based learning activities per marking period in school. The question is how to create a follow-up that permits checking accurate implementation and also, cross-curricular actions that involve other subjects to make it transversal and effective.

# How do you think your perspectives of ELF are related to your actual teaching practice in educating global citizens?

Most of the teachers accept that despite the fact they have somehow a better idea of what ELF is nowadays, they are not using ELF in class since is not part of institutional objectives nor has been part of their regular teaching practices. They also recognize that there is a connection between ELF and Global citizenship education and modifications need to be done in class. On the other hand, they say that implicitly through the teaching of English, students are always prone to be expose to international communication and constant reflection. This means that they work under these concepts but more theoretical framework should be given for better guidance. These are some of their interventions:

“I consider my practice in the classroom is just starting the approach, I think there are many ways to do it but methodology and tools need to be improved and increased. I think I am still quite far from applying a real ELF in my classes”.

“I would say that my perspectives of ELF relate to my teaching practice in the focus that I give to my activities, my students are involved in. My aim is to have them see English as a way to communicate with others in a context that appeals to their lives, that’s making them competent enough to exchange ideas with citizens from other cultures ”.

“OK… the way I think ELF is …mmm… what I thought at the beginning …er... must have been thought that is a subject but I think it is more than a subject, it goes beyond and takes our students to learn that they have a voice, they have to be, we courage our students to talk and they can change the world and that language is not only learning a grammar lesson or learning about countries… more than that. So, the perspective I have about ELF is that we can lead student to communicate with each other and to empower them to have a role in the community and change the world”.

So far with the teachers’ responses in the survey and in the group interview, we can see some convergences and divergences. On the first hand, some teachers have a clear idea of what ELF is and also how to create and implement strategies to promote global citizenship education in class. For instance, a teacher was congruent with her knowledge of ELF but avoiding (due to personal and institutional decisions) its use. On the other, some teachers responded they knew what ELF is. Unfortunately, at the moment of the application or raising awareness of it in class, they could not respond how it happens or how to do a didactic transposition.

Non-native teachers’ assumptions can be categorized in three main parts based on teachers responses in both the survey and the group interview: Native speakers as role models to follow for international certification, knowledge of ELF, cultural aspects to foster global citizenship.

First, non-native teachers in this context have been probably exposed to language English language models that gave them the idea of what English is, how English should be spoken or even written (only nativelike models). Teachers at this school may see competence in English as the quality of English production; and this production often maintains a ghostlike native English presence (Cook, 1999). International standardized tests aim aspects of the language such as: fluency and coherence, lexical resource, grammatical range and accuracy and pronunciation, as seen in the IELTS. These are elements that permeate teachers’ plannings and procedures in class. They usually want their students to produce English in a way that they can match the descriptors given in the rubric. For instance, in the IELTS speaking rubric. To reach a band 9 in grammatical range and accuracy2, it says: “produces consistently accurate structures apart from ‘slips’ characteristic of native speaker speech”. Therefore, teachers might see it as the goal to set for their students when being graded by international tests.

Added to that, teachers might desire their students to become competent language users as an L1 would do. Cook (1999, p.190) remarks the importance of the interlanguage. "The problem is that this L2 interlanguage exists in the same mind as the L1 does. Because no word existed to describe the knowledge of both the L1 and the L2, the term multicompetence was coined to refer to the compound state of a mind with two languages in Cook (1991)”. I doubt that many of these teachers have taken into account this concept when describing their students’ competences. This may affect the way teachers see their pupils. Perhaps, students are categorized as possible L2 competent language users but no as multicompetent languages users. That is to say, “a person who knows more than one language including both L1 competence and the L2 interlanguage” (Cook, 1999, p. 190) is a multicompetent language user. The latter might make a difference at the moment of recognizing students not only as English language learners but users of L1 and L2. Besides that;

recognizing the importance of the interlanguage concept, which may get both teachers and students closer to give a better position to ELF within language teaching/learning practices.

Second, participants demonstrated certain knowledge of what ELF is. Some of them see it as a practical way of language teaching and learning. Teachers might see ELF approach as a way to avoid going into details of the language. This should be focused only for communication and practical purposes. They also mentioned that ELF is a bridge from one culture to another; a language that is a language shared for those whose L1 is different, ELF is definitely a global and international language for commercial purposes and trade. Finally, two participants repeatedly highlighted the importance fo different variations of English. Teachers may link the concept of ELF with the up-to-date status of English around the world. Jenkins (2009, p. 10) remarks the importance of English as an international language and the future transformation of hierarchy of Englishes; “those who occupy the top of the English language hierarchy will no longer be NSs of English, but bilingual speakers of English who have the skills to function comfortably in multilingual communication”. Based on teachers’ responses, teachers are more conscious of Jenkins's thoughts.

Following this line, Seidlhofer (2005) says that teachers’ assume that English features are crucial for international intelligibility, which need to be learned, instead of mastering native speaker’s language distinctions. This means, that teaching English language should aim more for general language awareness and communication strategies.

And third, due to the fact that some teachers have experience and training with global citizenship education, intercultural awareness and intercultural skills at school, they take into account many aspects to foster global citizenship in accord with their answers in stage 1. Teachers mentioned features of the intercultural dimension such as: interaction, social identities, stereotypes, traditions, customs and culture. Throughout projects in class, teachers aims to develop respect for individuals, equity and equality of human rights (e.g. Byram et al., 2002). All in all, there is certain clarity of what building citizens for the world is and also how to approach it.

# STAGE 2: RELATION BETWEEN TEACHERS’ PERSPECTIVES AND THEIR TEACHING PRACTICES.

For identifying teachers’ use of ELF in the classroom, some questions were created in a check-up form (see table N.2). These questions came from the different definitions, features and perspectives of what ELF is (Canagarajah, 2007; Dewey, 2012; House, 1999; Jenkins, 2015; Seidlhofer, 2011), which might indicate at some point the use or promotion of ELF in the classroom and the implementation of strategies to raise awareness of the importance of this approach. This is a follow-up, for context, and was not intended to produce large amounts of new information.

# ELF USE IN THE CLASSROOM

Mark YES if there is any evidence of these features of ELF in the classroom, otherwise, mark NO.   
Table 2. OBSERVATION CHECK-UP FORM   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Is there any evidence of...</td><td>YES</td><td>NO</td></tr><tr><td>exposure to English variations?</td><td></td><td>III</td></tr><tr><td>teacher teaching strategies to negotiate meaning?</td><td></td><td>III</td></tr><tr><td>discussions on the role of English in the students&#x27; own country, and how students themselves use English or plan on using it in the future?</td><td></td><td>III</td></tr><tr><td>teaching strategies for students to adjust their expectations when listening to English variations?</td><td></td><td>III</td></tr><tr><td>showing students the English speaking population of the world?</td><td></td><td>III</td></tr><tr><td>having students discuss about NNS-NNS or NS-NNS interactions? For instance, videos, recordings, etc.</td><td></td><td>III</td></tr><tr><td>discussing what is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; in pronunciation when communicating with others (native or non-native speakers)?</td><td></td><td>III</td></tr></table></body></html>

After observing three different classes, the use or the awareness-raising of ELF was not totally seen in them. More than classifying teachers' actions as good or bad, it is to detect how teachers approach this concept in their teaching practices. As the chart shows only two points were given YES marks. These two points were positive since this teachers used students’ own productions to assess them and to give them the opportunity to offer peer-feedback. Students’ recordings were used to analyze the topic of people who have made significant changes in Colombia. Students gave feedback to each other and the teacher guided them by giving directions and information about English variations around the world. The teacher focused on communication and meaning negotiation rather than accuracy. This only happened at the speaking time. On the contrary, the same teachers corrected students’ written productions directly by using correction codes. Here, the instructor gave specific feedback on the mechanics of the language (grammar, spelling, syntax, etc). On the other hand, for the rest of the points and for the other three observations there was no evidence of any of the points given in the check-up form (see table n.2).

These findings indicate that these four teachers perceived practical difficulties with ELF since it might affect students' accuracy. Their beliefs on ELF as an approach with high levels of diversification, makes challenging for both teachers and students to reach international standards (Dewey, 2012). Standard English is well known by teachers at this school for avoiding any grammar mistakes or ‘unnatural' language, which name is given since teachers' beliefs are connected to English language nativelike production (natural). Teachers mark errors selectively since they might think this will help their students improve their language learning process (Truscott, 1996).

In regards with teachers’ promotion of global education in their classes. It was evident that teachers foster students to reflect constantly on their actions. They want their students to self-assess their thoughts to make a change not only for their country but for the world. Students are given, in the middle of classes, chances to participate and elaborate talks/speeches that demonstrate thought-provoking ideas regarding problematics in different contexts. Furthermore, students are asked to give possible solutions and to find a balance where everybody succeeds in a political way. Students read about civic literacy and global awareness. Furthermore, teachers from other subjects agree with English language teachers to contribute to students cross-cultural skills, critical and inventive-thinking development. These $2 1 ^ { \mathsf { s t } }$ century competences are part of the IB Diploma Programme (DP), which are linked to teachers' planning where they propose projects where students are able to put into practice intercultural competences such as savoirs; savoir comprendre, aprendre, fair; savoir être and savoir s'engager (Byram et al., 2002). Throughout the four classes, students had the chance to learn and practice these competences frequently. With regard to non-native teachers’ perceptions about the place of culture in language teaching contexts, almost all of the participants revealed that there is a close relationship between language and culture.

# STAGE 3: PERCEPTIONS VS CLASS PRACTICE/OBSERVATION - JUXTAPOSITION

Putting everything above together, we can say that non-native teachers may not be aware of the implications of ELF in Language English Teaching. They have some ideas of what ELF is. Nonetheless, they are not implementing strategies in classes to raise awareness of this concept nor teachers may not be interested in it due to the fact that they might consider it as a hindering fact to reach high-standard levels.

Comparing teachers' perspectives in the survey, group interview, and observations, we can identify three determining factors:

Non-native teachers give hints of ELF practices but barely apply them into their teaching practices.   
Non-native teachers approach their classes taking into account aspects of global citizenship education.   
Most of the non-native teachers might ignore the implications of ELF in educating students as global citizens.

# VI. CONCLUSIONS

The present research exposed findings that may have a number of implications in ELT and teacher training for this specific context. To begin with, the findings confirmed that a great majority of the non-native teachers at this school showed certain resistance towards the adoption of the ELF approach in their language teaching context. Additionally, most of the teachers who responded to the survey were interviewed and were observed preferred applying the rules of standard English instead of ELF notions. Regarding the intercultural dimension, teachers demonstrated knowledge on the application of strategies to foster global citizenship education in the classroom.

These findings are similar to some other studies. For instance, Soruç (2015) conducted research with forty-five non-native teachers from five different expanding circle countries, in which he pointed out that teachers preferred to use nativelike standards rather than ELF features. In another research Dewey (2012, p.159) found after interviewing a couple of teachers on their ELF perceptions that “the apparent unpredictability of a teacher’s stance with regard to normativity, and how this may well not correspond to his or her professed receptiveness to ELF as a concept”. This indicates, as this research has shown, that teachers “can display a fundamental ambivalence about ELF” (Dewey, 2012, p. 167) that makes difficult to predict whether teachers are totally in favor or against ELF and the possible application of this concept in their classrooms.

One thing is to recognize ELF as an acceptable alternative to standard English (English as a native language) and another is to find appropriate ways of teaching ELF. Teachers may encounter difficulties to match students' preferences and motivation with strategies and techniques applied in the classroom that bring inflection in the flows of meaning negotiation, fluency, and global communication without losing future accuracy in the language, if necessary. Teachers need to find ways to raise awareness of English variations and the reasons why these will give them more chances to communicate successfully. Furthermore, letting students know of the existence of Englishes will provide them with elements to create personalized strategies to modify their communicative acts both in comprehension and production skills.

I also believe that is necessary to give credit to the ELF movement for helping change the general perception of ‘English as a native language’ as a straightjacket, which once commanded the rules to follow when learning this language (Seidlhofer, 2004). Notwithstanding, a lot more of research needs to be done. It is imperative to involve more participants in a bigger and wider context. It is hard to say with this study the last word on this topic. I reckon that with this initiative at this school, the possibilities of seeing the world of English language differently will increase. Therefore, non-native teachers can help students see themselves as multicompetent languages users (Cook, 1999) and not as just L2 language learners.

Finally, participants of this study implemented strategies in class that facilitated the construction of citizens of the world. That is to say, once teachers have comprehended much better the concept of ELF, they will be able to analyze with a wider perspective the potential common grounds between ELF and global citizenship education.

Further research on this topic should be done with longer groups and in different contexts to conclude with higher validity and reliability what non-native teachers’ perspectives on teaching English as a Lingua Franca are and how these perspectives are related to actual teaching practice in educating global citizens in a more general way. Nevertheless, this study gives some clues of what can be done to start with little changes to big modifications in order to enhance English language practices in educative contexts, precisely at this school.

# VII. RECOMMENDATIONS

Language teaching practices can be modified positively if non-native teachers intake more perspectives from different pedagogical sources about ELF and ENL, ELF and Global citizenship education. Teachers should be able to study their contexts to identify what language use is required by their students to define their teaching procedures.

For this specific context, I suggest preparing teacher training workshops to enrich teachers’ perceptions of ELF and the possible implications for global citizenship education. The possible topics to cover are:

 Assessment (direct or indirect feedback when and why).  Material design, bearing in mind English variations.  Teaching and learning styles.   
 English variations (who speaks English today)   
 $2 1 ^ { \mathsf { s t } }$ -century skills.   
 Intercultural dimension development.   
 Raising learner awareness (ELF VS ENL)

After these workshop sections, both teachers and students should begin to understand that English variations are completely normal; that in some countries one accent has become the standard for various reasons, usually social, political, or economic; that attitudes to ELF and ENL may be personal, and are more often based on feelings than on coherent arguments; and that attitudes to different accents may also be based on social prejudices and stereotypes (Byram et al., 2002). -This last point is directly connected to global education -. Finally, these activities will also entice teachers to have more didactic considerations such as re-thinking goals in their projects and classes, modifying classroom practice, raising awareness of how English functions in the world today. and bringing out the idea of how accents variation is usual, highlighting that accents and intelligibility are not the same.
