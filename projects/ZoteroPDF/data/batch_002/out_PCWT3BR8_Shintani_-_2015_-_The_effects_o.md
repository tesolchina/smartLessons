This case study investigated the characteristics of computer-mediated synchronous corrective feedback (SCF, provided while students wrote) and asynchronous corrective feedback (ACF, provided after students had finished writing) in an EFL writing task. The task, designed to elicit the use of the hypothetical conditional, was completed by two Japanese university students in either the SCF or ACF condition. The writing process was video-recorded using the screen-capture function. An interview involving stimulated recall was conducted immediately after the writing session to investigate the two writers' perceptions about the feedback they received. The main findings were that (1) SCF created an interactive writing process similar in some respects to oral corrective feedback; (2) both the SCF and ACF promoted noticing-the-gap, but self-correction was more successful in the SCF condition; (3) focus on meaning and form took place contiguously in the SCF condition while it occurred separately in the ACF condition; and (4) both types of feedback facilitated metalinguistic understanding of the target feature, reflecting the unique features of writing (i.e., its slow pace, its permanency and the need of accuracy). These differences were confirmed by analyzing compositions written by 15 similar learners who received either type of feedback.

# Introduction

# Synchronous and asynchronous corrective feedback

Traditionally, written corrective feedback (CF) occurs only after a learner completes writing (delayed feedback) while oral CF generally occurs immediately or shortly after learners have committed an error. Oral CF research (e.g., Ellis, Loewen, & Erlam, 2006, Lyster, 2004), stemming from the cognitive interactionist SLA perspective, has therefore shed light on the theoretical underpinnings of immediate CF (see Lyster, Saito, & Sato, 2013). However, web-based word editing programs such as Google Docs allow teachers providing learners with synchronous corrective feedback (SCF) (i.e., immediate CF) as well as asynchronous corrective feedback (ACF) (i.e., delayed CF). SCF takes place online while the students are in the process of composing their texts. That is, both students and teacher are online at the same time, enabling the teacher to observe the students' composition process and provide instant corrections of their linguistic errors. In contrast, ACF occurs after students have completed a piece of writing. Specifically, the teacher provides feedback on completed computer-composed pieces of writing that students have submitted electronically. The timing of ACF feedback, thus, corresponds to traditional written CF involving a pencil-and-paper writing activity.

The majority of studies on computer-mediated feedback in second language (L2) writing have involved asynchronous feedback using a wiki (i.e., a Web page that can be revised by multiple users) (e.g., Castaneda & Cho, 2012; Lee, Cheung, Wong, & Lee, 2013; Li & Zhu, 2013; Wang, 2014). These studies focused on peer feedback in collaborative writing, and showed positive effects of drawing learners' attention to form during writing tasks on L2 development. Interestingly, however, except for a few studies that explored students' perceptions about feedback in distance education (Ypsilandis, 2002), there does not appear to be any study that has investigated asynchronous error corrections on L2 writing by teachers in a computer-mediated environment.

There are also only a few studies that have investigated synchronous interactions involving teachers (Kilckaya, 2013; Kim, 2014; Ko, 2012). These studies typically contrasted a synchronous environment with a face-to-face teaching condition by focusing on the communicative strategies used in teacher-student interactions (Guichon, Betrancourt, & Prie, 2012) or peer interaction (Kim, 2014; Ko, 2012). These studies revealed that the interactions which take place in a synchronous environment differ from those in a faceto-face envionment. Few studies have investigated the synchronous condition as an opportunity for providing feedback on L2 writing. One such study is by Kim (2010) who explored L2 learners' responses to synchronous feedback in three conditions  (1) teacher feedback, (2) peer review and (3) collaborative writing - over a semester. Students' end-of-term reflections on the experience indicated that the synchronous characteristics of Google Docs, such as the potential for immediate feedback and revisions, promoted their writing skills. Aubrey (2012) explored university EFL learners' perspectives on asynchronous and synchronous feedback, and reported that teacher-led feedback, regardless of whether it was synchronous or asynchronous, was preferred to peer feedback. These studies point to the potential usefulness of SCF in L2 writing.

Inspired by these studies, Shintani and Aubrey (forthcoming) conducted a study comparing the effects of synchronous and asynchronous feedback on the accurate use of the hypothetical conditional structure. A total of 68 university students in Japan were divided into three groups: the SCF, the ACF and the comparison groups. Each group completed two narrative writing tasks using Google Docs. The SCF and ACF groups received direct correct feedback on the target feature, while the comparison group did not. The SCF group received synchronous feedback in the form of corrections to grammatical errors as students were writing, while the ACF group received feedback after completing the task. Both groups were asked to revise their text - the SCF online as they received the feedback and the ACF offline after having received feedback on their completed writings. Gains in the accurate use of the target feature were measured by Text Reconstruction Tasks conducted as pre-, post- and delayed post-tests. The results showed that both experimental groups significantly improved on the two post-tests while the comparison group did not. Only the SCF group outperformed the comparison group on the delayed posttest, however. Shintani and Aubrey attributed this superiority of SCF over ACF to the cognitive processes the two types of feedback triggered. They argued that the SCF condition prompted three of the key processes involved in acquisition -- internalization, modification and consolidation (Williams, 2012) - which took place contiguously. In contrast, the ACF provided little opportunity for consolidation. Apart from Shintani and Aubrey (forthcoming), there has been no research comparing the effects of ACF and SCF.

The current study is a follow-up to Shintani and Aubrey (forthcoming). It employed a qualitative analysis to examine the process features of writing in SCF and ACF conditions, and aimed to provide a clearer understanding of the different effects the two types of feedback had on grammatical accuracy in new pieces of writing.

# Descriptive studies on written corrective feedback

Of relevance to the present study, however, are qualitative studies investigating L2 writing (e.g., Qi & Lapkin, 2001; Sachs & Polio, 2007; Storch & Wigglesworth, 2010). These have examined (1) what learners do when they are writing an original text; (2) what they do with the feedback they are given when they revise their writing; and (3) what use they make of feedback when producing a new piece of writing. These studies involved two types of data: self-reports where learners think-aloud as they write (Qi & Lapkin, 2001; Sachs & Polio, 2007) or the interactions that arise as learners complete a writing task collaboratively (Storch & Wigglesworth, 2010). The collected data were analyzed in terms of language related episodes (i.e., segments where the learners focused explicitly on specific language items) to identify which linguistic forms were attended to, whether the learners sought explanations for their linguistic choices, and whether the linguistic problems were successfully resolved.

One of the main findings of these studies was that what learners attended to while writing or engaging in the CF impacted their production at a later stage - either within the same piece of writing or in a new piece of writing. Qi and Lapkin (2001), for example, reported that the noticing which occurred in the first stage of a writing activity triggered noticing in subsequent stages, and that providing reason for the self-corrections they made had an impact on the final written product. Sachs and Polio (2007) also found that learners were more likely to make a change when they provided a reason for a change or when they employed metalanguage to discuss the feedback they had received. Storch and Wigglesworth (2010) reported that extensive engagement with feedback in the second stage led to higher levels of uptake (i.e., providing the correct form for the corrected errors) than when the learners individually completed the same task with no reference to the original composition (Stage 3).

Another key finding of these self-report studies is that learners differ in how they respond to written CF. Qi and Lapkin (2001) noted that the learners' L2 proficiency affected their ability to make use of the feedback. The learner with a relatively lower level of L2 proficiency experienced difficulty identifying the nature of the gap between his original text and the text in the reformulated version, especially when the change involved grammatical form. The case studies in Storch and Wigglesworth (2010) reported that retention of a correction (i.e., the correct use of a feature in a delayed writing task) was influenced not just by the learners' level of engagement with the feedback, but also by other factors such as the learners' beliefs, their attitudes toward the form of the feedback they received and their personal goals. For example, uptake and retention of corrections were more evident when the learners' goal was to improve accuracy than when their goal was to improve content or organization. It was clear that personal factors influenced the type of strategies the learners adopted in dealing with the feedback and also "their willingness to accept the feedback and their likelihood of retaining it' (p. 328).

Many of these studies used think-aloud protocol to investigate the moment-bymoment decisions learners make as they revise following CF. However, thinking-aloud potentially affects the actual process of revision and thus does not show how learners typically handle the feedback they receive. In this respect, these studies dealing with traditional written CF differ from oral CF studies that are able to document how learners respond to feedback as they receive it, and what use they make of this feedback in their subsequent production. However, by video-recording the computer screen while the students write, it is possible to obtain a record of the moment-by-writing process as the students handle the online feedback - either SCF or ACF - as illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Example of SCF.

The study reported below is an attempt to investigate the processes involved in dealing with online CF provided via SCF, and in what ways these processes differ from those involved in responding to ACF. In addition, the study made use of self-report through stimulated recall to investigate whether there were differences in the learners' own perceptions on the two types of feedback.

# Cognitive processes involved in direct SCF and ACF

Polio (2012) made the point that one limitation of written CF is that it is removed from 'actual meaningful use' (p. 383) (i.e., not contingent) as it only occurs after the learner has finished composing. While this is true for ACF, it does not apply to SCF, which is provided while the learner is in the process of composing a meaningful text. SCF provides the learners with negative evidence (i.e., it indicates they have made an error) and, in the case of direct SCF, positive evidence (i.e., it shows them what is grammatically correct) while they are formulating sentences to express their ideas. In this respect, direct SCF is similar to recasting in oral CF and involves similar but not identical cognitive processes.

Long (1996, 2007) argued that a recast facilitates form-function mapping because (1) it "conveys needed information about the target language in context' (Long, 2007, p. 77, italicized in original); (2) \*the learners are vested in the exchange, as it is their message that is at stake, and so will probably be motivated and attending" (pp. 77-78); (3) learners understand all or part of the interlocutor's response because it is a reformulation of their own utterances; and (4) it allows learners to form a cognitive comparison by comparing their own form with the appropriate form side by side.

All four points are applicable to SCF. However, it (1) does not occur in ACF if "in context' refers to real-time events. Arguably, it also (2) does not apply in ACF as learners have completed the composing process and may or may not be motivated to attend to the corrections that are provided afterwards. If Long is right, then SCF is more likely to engage with the cognitive mechanisms responsible for acquisition.

A similar conclusion is supported by the principle of transfer appropriate processing. This claims that the conditions under which a language is learned will determine the conditions under which it can be used (Lightbown, 2008; Segalowitz, 2003). Thus, feedback provided while students are writing is more likely to result in learning that can be subsequently deployed than feedback that is provided after a learner has completed a piece of writing. The contextualized feedback that occurs in SCF is potentially more usable than the decontextualized feedback in ACF.

SCF holds another potential advantage over ACF. As with oral CF, feedback that is provided while learners are formulating writing can be utilized to help avoid making the same error later in the text. In oral CF and in SCF, the effect of feedback on the same error is cumulative, enabling learners to produce the correct form while engaged in the same activity. The resulting correct production can be seen as practice that can help learners achieve greater control over the form (DeKeyser, 2007). This cycle of erroneous production followed by correction and then, potentially, production of the correct form, which can be seen as a form of hypothesis testing, is a feature of both oral CF and SCF. In ACF, however, each part of the cycle is separate with no opportunity for learners to benefit immediately from the corrections they receive. The likelihood is that learners will repeat the same errors as they write.

There are, however, differences between direct SCF and oral recasts, reflecting differences in the nature of writing and oral production. Williams (2012) identified three features that are unique to writing compared to oral production: (1) its slower pace, (2) the permanency of the record and (3) the need for and the opportunity for greater precision in language use. As writing takes place at a slower pace than oral production, learners have time to process the SCF they receive and are not pressured to respond to the feedback immediately. Thus, as Williams pointed out, learners have greater opportunity to noticethe-gap than in oral communication. The additional time that learners have to process SCF compared to oral recasts allows learners the opportunity to reflect on the corrections they receive and to construct an explicit representation of the grammatical features. SCF can provide similar opportunities but is not demanding on learners' working memory because the fedback constitutes a "permanent object". Oral recasts are demanding on working memory because they require the learner to compare their output with an interlocutor's reformulation in real time. Additionally, because writing requires greater precision than speaking, learners are more likely to be attentive to the online corrections they receive. Such corrections, unlike recasts, are inevitably explicit in nature. In this respect, SCF and ACF are alike.

# Research question

The current study investigated the differences in the process features of L2 writing that SCF and ACF involve to consolidate the findings by Shintani and Aubrey (forthcoming). The research question addressed in this study was:

In what ways do L2 writers differ in their use of and responses to synchronous and asynchronous computer-mediated written feedback?

The study attempted to answer the research question by (1) descriptively reporting on the two learners' writing process in SCF and ACF conditions and then (2) looking at the differences that manifested in (1) in a larger sample.

# Method

# Instructional context

# Participants

Participants were second-year university students attending an intensive English course in a private university in Japan. The course involved three 90 minute classes a week involving a mixture of form-focused and meaning-focused activities which aimed at developing the students' oral and written English production skills. The class that the participants were recruited from had 25 students who had obtained 420-450 in the TOEFL paper-based test. Two male Japanese learners - Masaki and Koji (pseudonyms) -- voluntarily participated in the first part of this study.

Masaki was 19 years old, a second-year law student. He had obtained a TOEFL score of 430 in the paper test before participating in this study. He started to learn English as a school subject in junior high school at the age of 12. He did not receive any additional outside-school instruction in English and he had never been overseas. He reported that English was always his favorite subject at school.

Koji was 19 years old, a second-year student, majoring in German. His TOEFL score was 450. He started to learn English as a school subject in junior high school at the age of 12. His English learning experience apart from the school was only at an entrance exam preparation class during high school. He had never been overseas. He reported that English was "not the best but always one of his favourite subjects".

The second part of the study involved another class from the same course at the university. The class consisted of the students with similar proficiency levels (i.e., scores of 420-450 in the TOEFL paper-based test). The students were randomly assigned to either the SCF group $( n = 8 )$ ) or the ACF group $( n = 7$ .1

# Target structure

The feedback focused on the hypothetical conditional, which expresses the hypothetical outcome of an event that did not occur in the past. The decision to focus on this structure was made because it is considered to be difficult to learn due to syntactic and semantic complexity (Celce-Murcia & Larsen-Freeman, 1999). Izumi, Bigelow, Fujiwara, and Fearnow (1999) argued that the difficulty of this structure lies in the fact that it requires learners to encode two functions: hypotheticality and past time reference. They noted that it is the most difficult of the three conditional sentence types because it requires an additional marker of pastness in the form of the past perfect to distinguish it from unreal conditional sentences. Thus, attempts to produce a hypothetical conditional sentence can result in multiple errors. In this respect, it constitutes an ideal target structure for this study. Also, previous studies (e.g., Shintani, Ellis, & Suzuki, 2014) have shown that CF can have a positive effect on helping learners to achieve greater accuracy in the use of the hypothetical conditional.

# Instruments and procedures

The composition task consisted of two parts: a pre-task which the learners completed at home and a main task which they completed during an individual session with the researcher. Two days before the treatment session, the participants received the pre-task sheet and were instructed to write five English sentences that described five events that had changed their life. They completed the pre-task at home and then brought the sheet to the individual session. The main task involved the participants writing about their life events and explaining what would have happened if these life events had not occurred. In other words, the task was designed to provide contexts for the production of five sentences using the hypothetical conditional. The instructions for the pre-task and main task are shown in Appendix 1.

In this study, the online interface - Google Docs -- was used for real-time editing. Google Docs is a file storage and synchronization service provided by Google, which enables user cloud storage, file sharing and collaborative editing. SCF took place as shown in Figure 1. When the student completed the sentence (in the first box), the teacher highlighted the part with the error (i.e., "did not meet') and provided the correct form in the comment box, "had not met'. Meanwhile, the student had already begun to write the next sentence (in the second box), but chose to return to the previous sentence to correct the error (in the third box).

The main writing task took place individually in a small meeting room at the university. Two tables were positioned about 2 meters apart. A computer (Mac Air) was set on each of the tables for the researcher - a Japanese speaker -- and the participant. At the beginning of the session, Google Drive was opened, providing the learners with a blank "document". This was shared online with the researcher, thus enabling the researcher to view and write on the Google Docs document. The participants then completed the main composition task using Google Docs. The learners were allowed to see their pre-task sheet while they were writing. Masaki and Koji received direct error corrections only on the grammatical errors they made as they attempted to formulate hypothetical conditional sentences.

In the SCF condition, as the student wrote, the researcher used the comment box function available on Google Docs to provide focused, direct CF. When the researcher noted the student had made an error, she first highlighted the part of the text containing the error and then provided the correction in a comment box (see Figure 1). Before starting the task, Masaki was told he should revise his writing as he received feedback. He was given 25 minutes to complete the task.

In the ACF condition, Koji was given 20 minutes to complete the writing task without any interruption from the researcher. When he had finished the task, his completed text was automatically saved on the Google Drive of the researcher. The researcher then corrected any errors in the hypothetical conditional using the comment box function on Google Docs. Thus, the format for providing the feedback looked the same as in the SCF condition. The student opened the corrected text five minutes later and was asked to revise his text by correcting the errors indicated by the researcher. He was given five minutes to revise his text. Thus, Koji had the same time (25 minutes) as Masaki to complete the whole task.

The writing process for the tasks was video-recorded using the screen capture function of Mac Air in the researcher's computer.

The 15 participants -- 8 for the SCF group and 7 for the ACF group -- in another class received the same pre-task two days before the main task, which was completed during regular class time. Direct CF was provided by two researchers - one provided SCF to the eight students and the other provided ACF to the seven students (see Shintani & Aubrey, forthcoming, for detailed procedures). The 15 participants' written documents were saved as Google Docs, which allowed the researcher to retrieve the process of corrections/ revisions of writing.

# Interview

An interview was conducted immediately after the two learners (Masaki and Koji) had completed the task. The participants were asked to choose which language they wished to use, but they both elected to speak in Japanese.

A stimulated recall was employed in the interview by playing the video-recordings of the students' writing captured by the computer monitor. The researcher and each participant watched the video data together. When the video showed either the learner making a change in his text or feedback being provided, the researcher paused the video and asked the learner to verbalize what they were thinking about at that moment. The researcher also asked questions such as, "Why did you do that?, "Did you notice the correction?" to elicit their thoughts during the writing. Following the stimulated recall, the researcher asked the participants about their perceptions of the writing task and the feedback they received. The interview was audio-recorded and transcribed for analysis.

# Data coding and analysis

A detailed transcript of their attempts to compose hypothetical conditional sentences was prepared based on the two participants' screen-video-recorded compositions (see below). Both Masaki and Koji attempted five hypothetical conditional sentences in their compositions. These attempts were analyzed in detail. The interview data were transcribed first and the learners' comments on their hypothetical conditional sentences were identified. To report the interview data, L1 utterances (Japanese) were translated into English by the researcher.

To report the writing process in the SCF condition, a transcript of Masaki's attempts was prepared (see Excerpt 1 for an example). The transcript had two columns. In the first column, the learner's attempts to produce hypothetical conditions together with any revisions he made were recorded. In the second column, the researcher's synchronous feedback was noted. Masaki's errors are shown as underlined while the researcher's corrections are presented using square parentheses. The "turns" that took place were numbered. Thus, Masaki's first attempt at producing a hypothetical conditional sentence was turn (1), the researcher's feedback was turn (2) and Masaki's subsequent attempt to revise following the feedback was turn (3).

For the ACF condition, there was no online correction. Thus, the transcript of Koji's attempts at producing hypothetical conditional sentences consisted of a single column. However, his "turns" were also numbered when he attempted to self-correct online (see Excerpt 6 for an example). The revisions that Koji made after he had received feedback are shown in Table 1. Column 1 recorded his initial attempts at producing hypothetical conditionals. Column 2 shows the changes he made in his rewritten text. The final written products of both students can be found in Appendix 2.

The compositions by the 15 learners were analyzed using Google Docs' "revision history" function, which allows viewing of the multiple stages of the compositions in the document with all the revision records made in each of the stages in a different color. In the process of coding, learners' attempts at hypothetical conditional sentences were first identified. Then, each sentence was coded in terms of (1) erroneous sentence; (2) self- or other-correction; and (3) successful or non-successful revision.

# Results

# Hypothetical conditional sentences by Masaki (SCF condition)

Excerpt 1 shows Masaki's first attempt to write a hypothetical conditional sentence.

Excerpt 1. Hypothetical conditional sentence 1 in the SCF condition.

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Learner&#x27;s attempt/revision</td><td>Online feedback</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>If I didn&#x27;t fail, I was very happy. But my heart is weaker than now.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td></td><td>If I didn&#x27;t fail [hadn&#x27;t failed the exam]</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>If I hadn&#x27;t failed the exam, I was very happy But my heart is weaker than now...</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td></td><td>I was [would have been] very happy.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>If I hadn&#x27;t failed the exam, I would have been very happy</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

The sentence contained errors in both the $i f .$ -clause and the main clause where he used the simple past tense (line 1). After Masaki completed this sentence and started to write the next sentence, the researcher provided feedback (line 2). Noticing the correction, Masaki immediately revised his error (line 3). In the stimulated recall session, he commented, "kore wa kateihou dattana to omotte, sono toori ni naosimashita' (I thought this was the conditional, so I revised it as suggested). While he was revising this error, the researcher provided feedback on the main clause (line 4). Masaki attended to the feedback and successfully revised his error (line 5). In the stimulated recall, he commented, "a, kokomo kateihou dakara would' ga iruyona tte" (I need "would' here because it's hypothetical conditional). For this sentence, the errors in the if-clause and main clause were both corrected by the researcher. His comments made use of metalanguage (e.g., "hypothetical conditional'), indicating that he was accessing his explicit knowledge of the hypothetical conditional form to make sense of the researcher's corrections.

His second attempt at a hypothetical conditional sentence also included errors but demonstrated some improvement (Excerpt 2).

Excerpt 2. Hypothetical conditional sentence 2 in the SCF condition.   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Learner&#x27;s attempt/revision</td><td>Online feedback</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>If I could have practiced tennis, I would get along well with another club members.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td></td><td>If I could have practiced [had been able to practice] tennis,</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td></td><td>.. I would get [have got] along well with another club members.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>If I had been able to practice tennis, I would have got along well with another club members.</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

It again included errors in both clauses: the past modal and the perfect aspect ("could have practiced") in the $i f .$ -clause and the past modal with no perfect aspect ("would get") in the main clause (line 1). In the stimulated recall, he reported, "ueno bun wo mite, kateihou dakara korede iito omotta' (Looking at the above sentence, I thought this would be correct for the conditional). After he started writing the next sentence, the researcher provided feedback on the errors in both clauses (lines 2 and 3). In the stimulated recall, he explained why he did not attend to the correction immediately by commenting, "a, mata naosareteru tte omotte, chotto konobun owattekara naosoukanato" (I noticed that it was corrected again but I thought I would finish this sentence first). Masaki, then, returned to the sentence containing errors and revised them successfully (line 4). He commented "a kokowa 'could' iranaindakke, tte. de, koko wa kakodakara have got' ka tte' (I didn't need "could' here, and then it should be "have got' here because it's about the past).

Masaki's second sentence included a modal verb and the perfect tense, demonstrating improvement from sentence 1, which included only the simple past tense. Masaki's report showed that he utilized the information provided by the first instance of CF, but that it did not lead to an error-free sentence.

Up to this point, there was no sign of any self-correction. However, self-correction appeared in the next sentence (Excerpt 3).

Excerpt 3. Hypothetical conditional sentence 3 in the SCF condition.   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Learner&#x27;s attempt/revision</td><td>Online feedback</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>If i ga</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>If i had been able to enter the college,</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>If i had been able to enter the college, I would have been very happy.</td></tr></table></body></html>

In the $i f { \cal { \cdot } }$ clause Masaki started to write "ga' for the verb phrase but deleted it and restarted the sentence with "had been able to", which was the correct form. Masaki recalled "saisho gave up' tte kakou toshite, demo, daigaku wo akirametara, jyanaiyona tte omotte, daigaku ni hairetara ni shinaito tte omotte, de, hairetara dakara been able to enter' de iikanato" (I started to write "gave up" but then realized that saying that if I gave up the college did not make sense. I thought I needed to say entering the college and so it should be "been able to enter'). In his answer to the researcher's question "kakutoki ueno bun wo mita' (Did you check the previous sentences when you wrote this?), he commented, "hai, had been able to practice' no tokoro wo tsukatte kaita kanji desu' (Yes, I utilized the part "had been able to practice").

He then continued by formulating the verb in the main clause correctly. He commented, "ue wo chekku shite, kokowa would' to 'have' to kakobunshi dana tte omoimashita' (I checked the above sentence and thought I need "would", "have" and PP here). This suggests that Masaki was busy working on how to formulate hypothetical conditional sentences while at the same time monitoring the grammatical form required. He was able to self-correct his error by consulting the record of his previous revision.

In the next attempt (Excerpt 4), he provided the correct form in the $i f .$ -clause but his main clause still had the same errors as in the second sentence (i.e., he failed to use the past perfect tense (line 1)).

He commented, "mata kono pata-n to omotte, chotto ue wo mite, demo kakutokiwa naiyou no koto wo kanngaete kaiteita to omoimasu' (I thought it was the same pattern again, so looked at the previous sentence above quickly, but when I wrote it I was mainly thinking about the content I was writing). Immediately after completing the verb phrase in the main clause, he noticed his error and self-corrected it successfully (line 2). He commented, "have' tte kaita tokoro de, have' iruyona tte omotte, modotte naohimashita" (When I wrote "have", I noticed that I also needed "have" here and corrected it). When asked "ueno bun wo chekku shita' (Did you check the above sentence?), he answered "tabun' (I think so). After self-correcting, he completed the sentence (line 3).

Excerpt 4 and the stimulated recall comments indicate that he was also focusing on the message he wanted to express while at the same time monitoring the verb form that had been corrected previously. He self-corrected his error in the $i f .$ -clause and produced the correct form in the main clause more easily than in Sentence 3.

In his last sentence (Excerpt 5), he first used the past auxiliary \*had' followed by the past verb form "went' (line 1) in the $i f .$ -clause, but then immediately replaced "went" with "been'' (line 2), which was the correct form.

He commented, "'went' janai been' danatte" (Not "went", but "been'). He continued his sentence and completed the main clause correctly. He recalled that "naretekita kanji" (I felt I started to get used to it) and that "konotokiwa, ue wo minakatta to omou" (I do not think I looked at the previous sentences this time).

Masaki also indicated how his attention shifted between meaning and form: "kaiterutokiwa, mazu naiyou wo kangaete, de, kakinagara bunpoumo chekku suru toiu kanji deshita' (When I started writing, I first thought about the content and then I checked grammar while I was writing). He also commented, "hokano bunpou no kotowa amari kinishite nakattakamo' (I might not have thought about other grammatical points).

Table 1 summarizes Masaki's attempts to write the five hypothetical conditional sentences.

In the first two sentences, the CF initiated by the researcher enabled him to notice the error and revise it successfully. This seems to have led him to self-correct the errors in the same structure in the following three sentences. He also demonstrated progress from the first sentence (where he used the past tense in both clauses) to the second sentence (where he used a modal verb and the perfect aspect). As Izumi el al. (1999) pointed out, the hypothetical conditional is a complex structure that requires learners to master several aspects of the target form to achieve complete accuracy. Initially, Masaki was dependent on the researcher's corrections, but later he was able to use his previous attempts and the revisions he made to self-correct new sentences. His ability to produce correct sentences was clearly progressive. The learner's stimulated recall data also indicated that he became less dependent on the researcher's corrections of a previous error as he repeatedly produced sentences with the same structure.

At the end of the interview session, Masaki commented on the usefulness of SCF by saying that "bunpouno kiokuga aimaina tokitokani tasuketemoraeru node sorewa sugoku iinato omoimasu' (It was helpful because I had help when I was not sure about the grammar), especially because "onaji machigai wo kurikaesanakute sumu' (I don't have to repeat the same errors). However, Masaki also made some negative comments: "kaiteru tochuu ni naosareruno wa sukoshi shuuchuu dekinai kanjiwa arimasukedo" (It was a little distracting as corrections were made while I was writing). He also commented, "jisho wo hiku hitsuyou ga naikara, rakudakedo, ukemini natteshimau kamo" (It is easier but might make us receptive because we don't have to look it up the dictionary).

# Hypothetical conditional sentences by Koji (ACF condition)

In order to describe the writing process chronologically, Koji's process in the ACF condition was reported in two phases: (1) the process of his original composition and (2) his revisions when he received ACF on his errors later.

Koji's five attempts at hypothetical conditional sentences in his original composition show that even though he did not receive any feedback, he engaged in some self-correction. Excerpt 6 shows Koji's first attempt at making a hypothetical conditional sentence.

Excerpt 6. Hypothetical conditional sentence 1 in the ACF condition.   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>Learner&#x27;s attempt/revision</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>If i did&#x27;t move to Osaka, I will</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>If i did&#x27;t move to Osaka, I would make different friends.</td></tr></table></body></html>

Koji used the simple past tense ("did't move", misspelled form of "didn't') in the $i f { \it \cdot }$ clause and the future marker "will' in the main clause (line 1). Then, he deleted "will' and restarted the sentence. This time he used the past modal "would' but failed to provide the past participle (line 2). In his stimulated recall, he reported, "moshi, oosaka ni hikkosanakattara dounatte itakanato kangaete imashita' (I was thinking what would have happened if I hadn't move to Osaka). When the researcher pointed out the correction he had made, he stated, "shitenakattara, dakara kateihoukana to. dakara would wo tsukaimashita" (It means "hadn't done it' so it should be conditional. So I used "would' here).

In Sentence 2 (Excerpt 7), he started with using "don' (a part of "don't') in the ifclause but immediately replaced it with "did't' (misspelling of "didn't). In the main clause, he used the past modal ("would") plus simple aspect ("be") with the wrong negation form in line 3.

Excerpt 7. Hypothetical conditional sentence 2 in the ACF condition.   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td> Learner&#x27;s attempt/revision</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>If I don</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>If I did&#x27;t travel to America,</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>If I did&#x27;t travel to America, I would be not so interested in movies.</td></tr></table></body></html>

Koji explained that "korewo kaiterutokiwa, naiyouni shuuchuu shiteimashita' (I was focusing on the content when I was writing this part). In his recall, he said, "kateihou dakara kakokeikanato. nantonaku would' wo tsukawanaito ikenaito iukoto wa oboeteitanode" (I thought it should be the past tense because it's hypothetical. I used "would' because I vaguely remembered it was needed). This comment indicates that although he had not received any feedback, he noticed gaps in his formulation of hypothetical conditional sentences. However, he was not able to self-correct successfully.

His following attempts indicate that his main focus was on the use of the modal auxiliary "would". In Sentence 3 (Excerpt 8), he self-corrected his main clause by replacing the past tense "lost' with "would lose" (line 3). In Sentence 4, he self-corrected "don't" into "wouldn't'. No correction was made in Sentence 5.

Excerpt 8. Hypothetical conditional sentences 3, 4 and 5 in the ACF condition.   
TMU: pseudonym of the university.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Sentence</td><td>Learner&#x27;s attempt/revision</td></tr><tr><td>Sentence 3</td><td>If I passed it,</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>If I passed it, I lost</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>If I passed it, I would lose the chance to effort.</td></tr><tr><td>Sentence 4</td><td>If I did&#x27;n enter TMU,</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>If I did&#x27;n enter TMU, I don&#x27;t</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>If I did&#x27;n enter TMU, I wouldn&#x27;t enjoy the school life.</td></tr><tr><td>Sentence 5</td><td>If they did&#x27;t live alone, I would not be lonly.</td></tr></table></body></html>

He recalled, "bunpou wa kinishitetandesukedo, tabun korede iikana to omotte onaji pata-n de kaiteimashita' (I was attending to grammar but I thought this would be correct so I repeated the same pattern).

After completing the task, Koji received direct CF on his hypothetical conditional errors and then revised them based on the feedback (Table 2).

He took approximately five minutes to revise his text. Although he corrected most of the errors, he failed to successfully revise one sentence (Sentence 3). He accidentally deleted "would' in his main clause when he replaced "lose" with "have lost'. In the stimulated recall, he indicated that he did not attend to the sentence carefully. He said "chanto mitemasen deshita' (I did not carefully look at it). When asked whether he had checked the sentence was correct after he had made the revision, he answered no and explained that "saisho dake mite, aa koreka tte omotte, ato wa onaji machigai nanode, kikaitekini naoshite imashita ne" (I looked carefully only at the first part and I understood my error, so I attended the rest only mechanically). He also commented "naoshiteru tokiwa, naiyouwa hotondo kangaete inakattadesune' (I corrected errors without thinking about the content of the text).

Table 3 summarizes Koji's writing/revising process of the five sentences in his origi. nal composition and revision.

Koji's self-corrections in his original text indicated that he did notice the gap between his production and the correct form of the hypothetical conditional. His corrections (e.g. correcting the tense and adding a past modal) suggest that he was noticing-the-gap, which enabled him to improve the accuracy of his sentences (Swain, 2005). However, he clearly lacked full knowledge of the correct form of the hypothetical conditional and thus was forced to rely on his "vague" understanding of how to formulate the verbs correctly (as he indicated in his stimulated recall reports). Koji's self-correction was not successful, and all the five hypothetical conditional sentences in his original composition included an error of one kind or another: use of the simple past tense in the $i f .$ -clause and omission of perfect tense in the main clause. Koji had the opportunity to correct his errors when revising. However, as discussed, this did not always occur when he was primarily focusing on meaning. Also, his retrospective report indicated that his correction strategy was "mechanical' as he focused on form rather than on the meaning the forms conveyed. This was very different from Masaki, whose attention seemed to move back and forth between the meaning and form of the sentence.

# Compositions in the class

Table 4 shows the number of attempts for the hypothetical sentence by each of the SCF learners, and the accuracy of each sentence. Five students wrote all the required five hypothetical sentences while three wrote three or four sentences. All the students' first attempts included errors (Sentence 1), followed by gradual reduction of errors and correct sentences at the end of their composition.

As shown in Table 5, the SCF students' composition involved various patterns of selfand other-corrections. There were ten occasions of learner self-correction - five successful and five unsuccessful. Three of the unsuccessful self-corrections were followed by successful other-corrections. On two occasions, learners made multiple corrections - the first unsuccessful but the second successful (Students 3 and 5). All the other non-corrected erroneous sentences were corrected by the researcher and successfully revised by the learners.

Table 6 shows the number of attempts in the composition task and the accuracy of each hypothetical sentence for the ACF group. All of the students produced either four or five hypothetical conditional sentences. All of the seven students started with an erroneous sentence repeated until the end of the composition with the exception of Student 9, who produced the correct form in the last two sentences.

As Table 7 shows, four out of seven students self-corrected their errors during the writing task. Student 9 successfully self-corrected the errors in Sentences 1 and 2 and subsequently produced correct forms in Sentences 3 and 4. All the other self-corrections did not lead to accurate revision.

Immediately after the students completed the task, the researcher provided CF on the remaining errors, which were all successfully revised by the individual students in the revision session.

# Discussion

The essential difference between SCF and ACF lies in the timing of the feedback - namely, whether it is immediate or delayed. This difference resulted in a number of differences in the writing process in this study.

First, the ACF resembled traditional written CF as it was entirely reactive, whereas the SCF constituted an interactive process between the student and the researcher. In SCF, there is an opportunity for the three processes involved in acquisition - internalization, modification and consolidation (Williams, 2012) - to take place contiguously in a cyclical manner. The SCF learner was able to notice the erroneous form while writing when he received the direct CF, which provided an opportunity for internalization of the correct form of the structure. The learner was then able to revise the error immediately (modification), but also had subsequent opportunities to produce the same structure in new sentences (consolidation). The analyses of both Masaki's and the eight students' writing processes illustrate how partially acquired knowledge of a grammatical structure was consolidated as the learners used the feedback and their online revisions when making new attempts at producing the structure (Housen & Kuiken, 2009). In the interview, Masaki reported that he appreciated the immediate feedback because it enabled him to address the uncertainty he felt about how to produce target-like hypothetical conditional sentences. This occurred because 'noticing-the-gap' (Swain, 1995) took place while he was writing and the SCF provided him with input just when it was needed. The interview data also indicated that he was aware that the cyclical process enhanced his fluency in producing the accurate form of this complex grammatical feature.

In the ACF condition, feedback was only provided after the learner had completed the composition. While there was an opportunity for internalization and modification in the revision session, the opportunity for consolidation was limited as Koji did not need to produce the target structure in new sentences. In his original composition, Koji did notice his errors sometimes and he did attempt self-corrections; however, these corrections were not successful -- he only ended up repeating the same error. It was not until the revision session that he was able to successfully correct them. This was also evident in the analysis of the seven ACF compositions: six out of the seven students were not able to produce the correct form by themselves due to the lack of full knowledge of the target structure and repeated errors throughout the compositions. Repeating errors in this way might have consolidated a faulty understanding of how to compose hypothetical conditional sentences.

Second, in the SCF condition, focus on meaning and form took place contiguously; in the ACF condition, focus on meaning and form occurred separately. The interview data indicated that Masaki shifted his attention back and forth between meaning (i.e., what he wanted to say) and form (i.e., how to say it). The shift was not as rapid as in oral production because of the slow pace of writing (Williams, 2012), but it required the learner to pay brief attention to form while his overall attention was on meaning. This was not the case for the ACF condition: Koji reported that in the revision session his attention was no longer on meaning and that he ended up revising the errors "mechanically". In other words, the SCF condition created "a window of opportunity", which Doughty (2001) argues constitutes the ideal conditions for helping learners to map forms onto the meanings they are struggling to express.

Doughty, however, was referring to the role played by recasts in oral interaction, direct SCF differs from oral recasts. Oral interaction takes place rapidly with little opportunity for learners to reflect on the feedback they receive. In contrast, writing takes place at a slow pace and results in a permanent record (Williams, 2012). Thus, the learner has a linguistic "object' available and the time to inspect it. This is what seems to have been important in the SCF condition. Masaki's shift from other-correction to self-correction as he attempted to produce new hypothetical conditional sentences was possible because the feedback he had received on his previous attempts was accessible at any time. He had sufficient time to refer to the feedback on his previous attempts and to use this to try to selfcorrect his errors on new sentences. The importance of being able to use the feedback at his own pace is reflected in his comment about the second sentence he attempted: "I noticed that it was corrected again but I thought I would finish this sentence first'. Processing oral recasts is demanding on working memory, but processing written direct feedback in SCF is much less so (as suggested in Williams, 2012). In other words, the "window of opportunity" is greater, affording learners more time to make the "cognitive comparisons" which Long (2007) considers so important for learning.

SCF differs from oral recasts in another important way. Recasts are generally considered to constitute an implicit form of feedback, while written feedback is inevitably explicit (Polio, 2012); this holds true for SCF. SCF invites conscious and deliberate attention, as was evident in both Masaki's actions (immediate revision) and his reflective comments. Masaki invariably attempted to revise following feedback and did so in full consciousness and with developing awareness of how to construct the complex verb forms required. This was evident in the eight SCF students' successful immediate revisions after receiving other-correction (i.e., CF from the researcher) while they were writing. Implicit oral recasts do not always result in attempted uptake (Lyster & Ranta, 1997). In this respect, then, SCF is like ACF - both invite conscious processing and cater to awareness at the level of understanding. Writing, by its very nature, requires precision of expression and is likely to draw on metalinguistic knowledge (Williams, 2012).

The case study of Masaki indicated that SCF was very effective in promoting conscious analysis. The stimulated recall data illustrates how Masaki was able to offer reasons for the corrections he made (e.g., Sentence 1: "I need would here because it's conditional', Sentence 2: "I didn't need 'could' here, and then it should be have got' here because it's about the past'). Previous studies (Sachs & Polio, 2007; Storch & Wigglesworth, 2010) have shown that learners are more likely to uptake feedback and make use of it in later writings, when they have made an effort to understand it. This can occur in ACF -- as these studies demonstrated -- but is perhaps even more likely in SCF, as found in Shintani and Aubrey (forthcoming).

# Conclusion

The current study provided some novel insights into the role of CF in L2 writing. In particular, it addressed how the timing of feedback influences the process of writing and the potential for language learning. It highlighted the potential advantages of SCF using an online program. SCF has potential advantages over both oral CF and traditional written feedback (i.e., ACF). SCF, like oral CF, provides opportunities for noticing linguistic forms in context, delivers input when it is needed, and allows learners to use the information in their subsequent output. Like ACF, SCF allows learners time to attend to feedback and thus makes it easier for them to carry out cognitive comparisons and to use their explicit understanding in subsequent production (i.e., uptake). Both SCF and ACF are far less demanding on working memory than oral CF.

SCF caters to the kind of development that sociocultural theory claims takes place (i.e., other regulation gives way to self-regulation). Aljaafreh and Lantolf (1994) showed that scaffolded oral CF encouraged learners relying initially on the other-corrections to move on to self-correction. Although the SCF in the present study was different from that in Aljaafreh and Lantolf, it also led to an increasing shift from other- to self-correction over the course of writing. In this way, we can see evidence of learning taking place in flight, so to speak, in SCF.

Some limitations of the current study should be acknowledged. Clearly the findings of the study are not generalizable to all contexts as only one-shot compositions of 17 students were analyzed. The study did not investigate the learners' use of the target structure in a new piece of writing. Thus, this study does not show if the two types of CF resulted in learning as measured by independent use of the target structure. However, in Shintani and Aubrey (forthcoming), evidence demonstrating the superiority of SCF over ACF in this respect is presented. Also, the current study only investigated one grammatical feature, the hypothetical conditional, which is considered to be relatively salient and complex (see Izumi et al., 1999). Focusing on different grammatical features might lead to different results. Additionally, correcting multiple features in one piece of writing might lead to different levels of attention by learners (see Shintani et al., 2014). This study did not investigate these aspects.

In future research, it would be interesting to investigate different ways of providing SCF. In this study, the researcher provided SCF only after the learner had completed a sentence. However, it would also be possible for the feedback to be made available more clearly online, i.e., while the student is still writing the sentence. This would make the feedback closer in nature to oral CF. It would also be interesting to investigate whether SCF and ACF have any differential impact on learners' implicit knowledge, for example, by investigating whether the feedback leads to greater accuracy in spontaneous oral production.

Finally, the study demonstrated that computer-mediated synchronous error correction has potential pedagogical benefits for L2 writing. Shintani and Aubrey (forthcoming) has demonstrated that SCF is feasible by one teacher with a relatively small classroom. It might be also possible to train L2 learners to provide SCF on their peers' writing. Various writing tasks using Google Docs can be designed involving either individual or collaborative writing. Future research can explore the impact SCF as well as computer-mediated written CF in general has in classroom pedagogy.

Masaki

I failed the examination when I was a junior high school student. The occurrence made me very sad. If I hadn't failed the exam, I would have been happy. But my heart would be weaker than now. I practiced tennis alone when I was alone when I was a high school student. My club members didn't have no minds to practice tennis. So I had to practice tennis alone.If I had been able to practice tennis, I would have got along with another club members. I failed the examination when I was a high school student. I must be a student who failed my college entrance examinations and is studying again. If I had been able to enter the college, I would have been very happy. I could enter the K,G. I was very happy. If I had failed the examination again, I would have been able to have confidence to me never. I went to Malaysia last year. The occurrence changed my thought about Japan. If I hadn't been to Malaysia, my thought would not have changed.

Koji

When I was 10 years old, I move from Saitama to Osaka. If I hadn't moved to Osaka, I would have made different friends. When I was 8 years old, I traveled to America. If I hadn't traveled to America, I wouldn't have been so interested in movies. I fail this college entrance exam. If I had passed it, I have lost the chance to make an effort. I entered TMU \*. If I hadn't enter TMU, I wouldn't have enjoyed the school life. My brother and sister live alone.

If they hadn't lived alone, I would not be lonely.
