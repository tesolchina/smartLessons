# Ann-Marie Eriksson\* and Åsa Mäkitalo Supervision at the outline stage: introducing and encountering issues of sustainable development through academic writing assignments

Abstract: Universities are responsible for introducing students to disciplinary fields and their knowledge traditions. A common way to cater for processes of this kind is to organize students’ work through the production of text in a genre common in their field. Previous research has pointed to the challenges involved as students appropriate disciplinary ways of reasoning through writing, yet further attention needs to be directed to the communicative challenges involved at the very beginning of the process. Based on 14 video-recorded face-to-face encounters between environmental experts and individual MSc Engineering students, this study focuses on supervision at the outline stage of producing a report, and explores it as a communicative practice. The results from our study show how the students’ outline documents functioned as resources for separating the performing of a study from the crafting of its textual presentation. The results also illuminate, in detail, how access points to disciplinary reasoning and arguing were introduced through verbal discourse.

# 1 Introduction

In the modern knowledge society, writing marks a substantial activity through which disciplinary communities produce and maintain genres that shape, evaluate, codify, and organize knowledge. As part of disciplinary life, genres also support ways of reasoning and arguing that are relevant in specific knowledge domains. As Bazerman so eloquently puts it:

Genres are not just forms. Genres are forms of life, ways of being. They are frames for social action. They are environments for learning. They are locations within which meaning is constructed. Genres shape the thoughts we form and the communications by which we interact. (Bazerman 1997b: 19)

A central concern related to the dynamism Bazerman articulates involves how communicative engagements with genre function as a form of enculturation (Bazerman 1997a; Prior 2006). While universities are major societal actors when it comes to maintaining and producing knowledge, they also have a responsibility for guiding students through encounters with knowledge domains that are new to them and this is an institutional communicative concern. As part of instructional practice, genres and disciplinarity transform into literacy processes of structuring work and presenting findings in relevant ways. In other words, stepping into disciplinary knowledge domains implies appropriating certain ways of framing issues, of grounding arguments, and of making relevant knowledge claims (i.e., epistemic practices).

A frequent means for scaffolding such processes pedagogically is to arrange academic writing assignments where students are to produce a text in a genre that is typical within their field. The initial stage of such assignments is particularly decisive and demanding (cf. Prior 1998). For teachers it is critical to make sure that students are on a fruitful track. For students, it is critical to find out what kind of work will secure successful progress with the task. Consequently, the initial stage of supervising students in such writing assignments represents a situation where essential means to successfully move forward are in demand.

This study investigates supervision as a communicative practice with the aim of exploring what mediational means are made salient in supervision at the initial stage of writing, and more precisely, how such means are introduced and interactively made sense of as core elements of a typical textual genre in the field. Empirically, the study was conducted within an introductory module of environmental engineering education for international Master’s students who were guided into the field by writing a report on an issue of sustainable development.

In the following we will first situate our research in relation to earlier studies. Then a theoretically grounded account of our analytical approach follows, before presenting the empirical study. In the result section we first present how the communicative practice of supervision was routinely structured across the 14 initial sessions around students’ outline documents. Then a more detailed analysis of recurrent epistemic concerns that surfaced as topics of conversation across the cases follow. Based on a selection of specific communicative episodes, a detailed analysis of participants’ meaning making illuminates how mediational means, essential for the field of environmental systems analysis, were introduced and made sense of in supervision around students’ “outline” documents.

# 1.1 Earlier studies of supervision around students’ texts

Earlier research has identified supervision as a key practice for university students’ production of text while also pointing to the challenges involved as newcomers are required to adopt disciplinary ways of reasoning through writing (Dysthe 2012; Dysthe et al. 2006). In this research tradition, there is a noticeable emphasis on the significance of teachers’ and students’ cooperative engagement for the development of identity (Dressen-Hammouda 2008; Ivanic 1998) and enculturation (Paré et al. 2011) through academic writing assignments.

With an interest in supervision as talk-in-interaction, a series of recent conversation analytic studies (Vehviläinen 2009a, Vehviläinen 2009b; Vehviläinen 2012; Park 2012) have illuminated the ways in which participants’ interaction is critical for supervision as an activity. In a study of the opening stage of supervision of Master theses papers, Svinhufvud and Vehviläinen (2013) demonstrated the importance of the textual artifact in the interaction. First, they noticed that the students’ texts were a necessity for initiating the supervisory activity. If they had been submitted electronically, a printed version was commonly used. They also observed that the texts functioned as guides for what was brought up in the conversation; especially written comments on the students’ texts were common points of orientation and support. In a sociocultural parlance, the textual artifacts and the added comments of the supervisor served as mediational means (Wertsch 2007) in the sense that they oriented the participants’ perception, structured the activity, and set the agenda for what was addressed in their conversations.

While studies like these inform us about the significant role of the written text in the socialization of genres, it is also important to investigate how disciplinary forms of reasoning are introduced by experts in supervision of students who are novice writers in their field. Such encounters constitute empirical sites in which particular features of genres and their disciplinarity need to be accounted for and made sense of. A closer look at the circulation of textual artifacts in literate activities similar to supervisory sessions was provided by Prior’s (1998) groundbreaking account of how students’ production of text coconstitutes a process of disciplinarity. For instance, this research showed how university students gradually employed responses to their text drafts in more specialized ways. One student, Moira, gradually began to use formulations and changed her stance in ways that went far beyond conforming to the specific linguistic register of sociology through a journey of resisting and accepting the supervisor’s comments on a text-in-the-making. Another student, Sean, whose dissertation hypothesis was discussed in a sociology seminar, gradually aligned his work with the explorative, scientific approach of his sociology research group. In Prior’s terms, key practices related to sociological reasoning that Sean encountered in the seminar discussions functioned as a form of enculturation “into durable social practices” (Prior 1998: 210). What emerges from this study is the notion of “mediated authorship,” i.e., how processes of authorship take place in relation to mediational means, and an understanding of enculturation as “a continuous, heterogeneous process of becoming […] through everyday mediations of activity and agency” rather than through “transmission of specialized knowledge and discourse to novices” (Prior 1998: 244).

Results like these indicate that enculturation into knowledge traditions is a long-term process contingent on the mediational means by which knowledge practices can be externalized. A problem is that once such practices have been appropriated they are no longer easily accessible to the individual. In an analysis of professors’ and students’ “own descriptions of the supervision process and the textual practices in which they participated” (Dysthe 2002: 503), Dysthe observed precisely this; professors were highly aware of subtleties like differences between different research traditions, specializations, and influential research in their area of expertise but provided feedback that did not articulate such differences (cf. Paré 2011, who reached similar conclusions). Dysthe also found that knowledge traditions shaped how the supervision activity was carried out: as teaching, partnership, or apprenticeship. An additional but important finding was the observation that even though such cultural elements were highly influential for the written feedback on specific student texts as well as for the supervision activity, the students showed difficulties in articulating premises of this kind. Consequently, in spite of teachers’ feedback and the form of the supervision activity they participated in, students had problems grasping the cultural level of the elements that were introduced. These results highlight the importance of carefully guiding students through the specific features of genre and disciplinarity that are substantial for the knowledge domain. At the same time we know that this kind of guidance is a challenging process also for an expert.

# 1.2 Supervision as a mediating activity and communicative practice

The form of enculturation we have been discussing is accordingly understood as a long-term, prospective process for the individual, requiring exposure to and active engagement with the specific genres and knowledge practices of disciplinary fields (Prior 1998; Wertsch and Kazak 2011). To contribute to our understanding of what this implies for educational settings, we believe further empirical attention needs to be directed to the initial stage in which students’ learning is at stake and becomes a concern for experts in their field. In the present study, the work of guiding university students into a field that is new to them is conceptualized as a mediating activity (Vygotsky 1978; Wertsch 2007) and a situated communicative concern (Prior 2006; Bazerman 2012).

From a sociocultural perspective, supervision at the initial stage of writing necessarily involves some explicit mediating means (Wertsch 2007). Mediation typically involves the use of “signs in the form of natural language which have evolved in the service of communication and are then harnessed in other forms of activity” (Wertsch 2007: 185). Whereas writing assignments and outlines are typically used as material semiotic resources at the initial stage of supervision, other salient mediating means, such as particular speech genres or social languages (Bakhtin 1986), may be orally introduced and drawn on in the ongoing conversation. The ways that mediational means are invoked or drawn upon as part of ongoing activities may both constrain or provide access to relevant fields and their epistemic premises (Dysthe 2002).

As a communicative practice (Linell 1998) supervision at the initial stage of enculturation is, however, far from a straightforward process. In such interaction, specific features of genre and disciplinarity are anything but visible and stable to the beginner. The basic functions of such cultural tools for the performing and reporting of a study have to be made comprehensible at the early stage of socialization (cf. Wertsch and Kazak 2011). This is a communicative challenge and concern for the parties involved. How mediational means are interactively made sense of in situ is critical, precisely since they have the potential to provide access points to the field, i.e., as they start to function as vehicles for students’ appropriation of genres and disciplinary ways of reasoning (Wertsch 2007).

Analytically, this implies an investigation of supervision as an-interactionalactivity-mediated-by-cultural-tools, where participants’ meaning making is in focus (Säljö 2009). This, in turn, necessitates methods by which supervision, as a communicative practice, can be captured in ways that allow for rigorous and reliable analyses. As we shall see in the following, video recordings provide opportunities to observe, document, and revisit the interaction for analytical purposes.

# 1.3 Aim and research questions

As we have already mentioned, this study investigates supervision as a communicative practice with the aim of exploring what mediational means are made salient in supervision at the initial stage of writing, and more precisely, how such mediational means are introduced and interactively made sense of as core elements of a typical genre in the field.

To investigate supervision as a communicative practice at the outline stage, we attended to recurrent activities and epistemic concerns that surfaced as topics of conversation in the empirical data and explored their functions within and across the 14 cases. Then, we addressed the following questions:

1. How were the students’ outline documents used as access points for writing a report in the field of environmental systems analysis?   
2. What key elements of this particular genre were introduced as mediational means to engage with issues of sustainable development?

# 2 Empirical case

The empirical material used in the present study is part of a larger corpus of data generated from following an academic writing assignment that was part of an international Master’s course for environmental engineering at a Scandinavian institute of technology. The assignment was organized around a series of supervisory sessions that stood out as rich and significant examples of communicative encounters.

# 2.1 Setting

All in all, 14 students worked individually with this assignment for five weeks. Each student’s preparation for the first supervision session consisted of putting together an outline for an individual report on a particular issue of sustainable development. As exemplified by Figure 1, topics were generally framed by an overall question followed by a set of additional questions and recommendations for relevant reading such as scientific articles, websites, and books.

Is trade always good?   
For many decades trade has increased along with urbanisation, industrialization, growing markets and specialization with low transport costs as an important factor, in turn because of the availability of fossil fuels. This has driven the development in both positive, but maybe also negative, ways for the countries involved in trade, among other thing because trade also have several environmental effects and is connected to development. What are the drivers of trade? What is the historical trend of trade? How is trade linked with development? What are the environmental effects of trade? What 'actors' have a role in controlling trade between nations, in regions and at global level and what means do they have to govern trade related environmental issues? What environmental effects may occur from changes in the institutions of trade, like free trade arrangements? What is the potential for concepts like "fair trade" (FSC, Max Havelaar, etc.) to make significant contribution to Sustainable Development? Information Resources (examples)

The instructions for the submission of an outline consisted of a general text type description, see Figure 2.

The students submitted their outline documents in response to both these instructions a few days prior to the supervision. This gave teachers time to prepare comments in advance.

# 2.2 Data

The supervisory sessions varied significantly in duration, from 15 minutes to 55 minutes, and produced slightly more than 7 hours of video-recorded data. In combination with the video material, we also collected the outline documents that were discussed as well as other documents used and produced during the sessions. This resulted in a corpus of 14 empirical cases that included video in combination with artifacts such as students’ outline documents, teachers’ written comments, notes and sketches.

The recordings were first transcribed verbatim according to the recommendations for interaction analysis by Jordan and Henderson (1995). As specific text segments, notes, or sketches were drawn on by the participants, certain instances in the material needed closer transcription of extra-verbal activities. As artifacts and representations came to function as mediating means in the supervision practice, we attended to how reasoning relevant for the writing project was displayed and made sense of by the participants (cf. Ivarsson et al. 2009). Thus, we analyzed the activities in the video clips and paid attention to how artifacts were used as mediating resources in the activity.

# 3 Supervision at the outline stage: communicative activities and mediating means

The results are presented in the two sections that follow. The first section introduces the overall pattern across cases and discusses supervision as a communicative practice, while the second section provides an analysis by highlighting a few typical episodes from two of the 14 cases in greater detail. These two cases were selected on the basis of being representative of three typical ways disciplinary elements essential to the particular genre were introduced as mediating means. As will be shown, similar kinds of concerns were addressed in these three examples.

# 3.1 The supervision session as a communicative practice

The cross-case analysis made recurring activities and epistemic concerns in these outline sessions visible. Figure 3 illustrates these findings as typical communicative activities within the supervision sessions.

![](img/f1c7c3797106a6641b7fb98f3aa6702a45e30d2157532154447ea90f00b3ba6c.jpg)  
Figure 3: Activities and their functions across cases in the communicative practice of supervision.

As can be seen in Figure 3, the supervision typically started as teachers oriented toward the student-produced outline documents and commented on them as a response to the task given (cf. 1). The outline document thus functioned as an important, agenda-setting point of departure for the session. In line with findings by Svinhufvud and Vehviläinen (2013), it was used as a representation of the particular student’s approach to the task. As such, it was commented on in terms of how well it satisfied the normative expectations of an outline.

On the basis of this opening theme, we observed that the supervision took somewhat different routes even though the same kind of activities occurred across the cases. The typical move made in relation to documents that did not meet the expectations of an outline was an elaboration of the notion of outlines as textual representations of an engineering study and what function they should serve for completing the assignment. Alternatively, if the outline document did meet expectations, the teacher typically addressed the specific sustainability issue of concern. In both situations, the outline functioned as a point of departure in addressing the student’s work with a study and the text-to-beproduced as separate processes. This simultaneously set the agenda for the rest of the supervision. As this distinction between performing a study and the production of text was settled in the encounters, the teachers drew on the students’ outline documents as mediational means (cf. 2 and 3). Particular ways of reasoning and arguing were also brought into the conversation. Toward the end of each session, the participants typically planned for the next step in the students’ work (cf. 4).

Based on a few selected episodes, the following section of the results first discusses the functions of the first two activities identified in the outline sessions (1 and 2) while addressing the question of how the outline document became an access point for writing in environmental engineering. The third activity is analyzed in greater detail by contrasting episodes that exemplify how key elements of the genre were brought into the supervision as mediational means.

# 3.2 Orienting toward the function of the outline

The students’ outline documents came in very different shapes and formats. Figure 4 shows a text extract from an outline for a study of international trade and sustainable development. As can be seen, this figure displays a few sections of the student’s text with the teacher’s written comments.

In the episode shown in Table 1, we will look at how the environmental engineering teacher opens the session around this outline by turning to the document, cf. the first typical communicative activity in Figure 3.

As can be seen from Table 1, the teacher starts by acknowledging the current document as an acceptable response to outlining as an assignment (line 1): you have made an outline. Following the student’s question (line 2), which points to the evaluating function of the teacher’s role, the teacher introduces an epistemic level by explaining the idea of outlines (lines 3–5) in general terms: because an outline is kind of a (.) a plan of the study so it is eh where you can s- the first idea on … what you want to know (.). While explicating the function of an outline as an act of anticipation, he also emphasizes a more methodological quality as embedded in the act of creating an outline. The work of making a presentable plan for a study is simultaneously an instance where one can begin to grasp one’s own idea. However, and for the participants, precisely how outlining constitutes a method for coming to grips with what work needs to be done has to be clarified further, and the teacher continues to unpack the document as a set of actions (lines 5–10):

![](img/ea136d598c215d06aaec361d5257d8843781a2f7823fb8e8af5ad8a490cb6e33.jpg)

on what you want to know (.) and then eh (.) what do you need to know (.) to know what you want (.) which is eh well so this mean- that’s the aim (.) where your direction where you’re heading off and then some- some research questions which are more specified (.) and (..) eh then eh something (.) on the (.) method (..) how are you going to find that out.

In these turns, the teacher sequences central functions that anticipate the carrying out of a study with relevance for the disciplinary field. Sequencing like this displays an internal logic and order for a line of reasoning that would produce a starting point for the student’s investigation of a problem. It invites a certain type of genre. The relationship between a question to answer, what you want to know (line 5), and means of dealing with this question, is something that the teacher tries to clarify in response to the outline document at hand. When he receives a minimal response from the student (line 11), the teacher summarizes the previous elaboration and emphasizes that there are concerns related to the arranging and bringing together of different parts in order to answer the overall question (lines 12–14). What is made relevant by this elaboration is the practice of outlining, rather than qualities of the document. Rather than positioning the outline as a first version of the final text product, we can observe how the teacher’s reading and use of it shapes the work around the writing project. Outlining stands out as part of the practice that would, in this situation, feasibly produce a case study of international trade and sustainability.

By explicating aim, research questions, and method (lines 7–9), the teacher highlights a way of organizing text before he goes on and verbalizes what actions are related to the presentation of, for example, an aim as where you’re heading off (line 7). Method is unpacked in a similar way (lines 9 and 10): how are you going to find that out. This is followed by an extended set of other active verb phrases and metaphors going to bring together, to answer, say, going to arrange. In Bakhtinian terminology, these terms stand out as part of specific, social languages (Bakhtin 1986) and as part of the academic genre. Analytically, they can be understood as emerging enactments in the encounter since they are creatively brought into the conversation as inference-rich, epistemic categories of academic life. As a result, this example shows how the outline document is used to introduce relevant academic writing conventions and how such conventions could be understood. However, and as we will discuss in the following, the consequences of this distinction have to be clarified further for the student.

# 3.3 Topicalizing academic writing as process and as product

Another recurring concern of the participants related to the function of an outline is how, and to what extent, the formulation of the assignment functions as a guide for the arrangement of a text, for the arrangement of a topic, and for the organization of a study that is to be carried out. To discuss how such distinctions are introduced as mediating means in relation to outline documents, we will look at another example: a case concerning air pollution. The instructions for this topic are presented in Figure 5.

# Acceptably clean air

Air quality is an environmental concern with profound impacts on human health. The sources, chemistry and effects of aerial pollution are complicated. What are the most relevant forms of pollution and what activities do they come from? Is it the same answer in the developed and developing world? How are acceptable levels of pollutants decided and air quality measured? How can pollution be tracked and how does this affect efforts to reduce it? Will air quality get better or worse?

As can be observed, the student document displays quite a few instances where phrases from the assignment sheet have been included in the outline (see

Appendix 2 for clarification). It can, for example, be noted that the arrangement of the outline follows the order of the questions in the assignment instructions. As practice, such kinds of explicit re-presentation can be understood as a form of response to the educational setting and the assignment as a normative practice, or in Prior’s terms, a form of “mediated alignment” (Prior 1998: 87) with the institutional framing of the activity. However, in the excerpt in Figure 7, we will follow how this teacher initiates a process that could turn this student’s outline into an element of an approach to genre, related to environmental engineering. What we aim to show is how the outline document is used as a concrete point of departure and a contrasting element when explaining and sequencing the order of the work to be done – something that differs from the arrangement of the outline document.

This teacher begins by addressing the outline document as a whole (line 1), and explaining that there are concerns (line 2) related to his reading of the document. His explication of this comes as an account (lines 3 and 4): I think you will find it it’s faster to write it not in this order. Framed as an institutional activity, this account both alludes to the time constraints of the writing project as a whole and to the expected accomplishments in the next step of the writing process. What the teacher suggests in what follows is an alternative approach to the order displayed in the outline document, and the argument for this is that such an alternative approach would be faster.

The sequencing of another order begins as the teacher addresses comparison as a concrete instance in the outline (line 6): it’s probably fastest to do the comparison first. The student’s response (lines 7, 9) is followed by a clarification (line 10) that relates “comparison” to “data.” However, the student does not yet show that she is following the teacher’s reasoning and he continues demonstrating what he sees as potentials in terms of an alternative order, verbally as well as by pointing (lines 12–20):

this second [points to “methods”, looks at student] $/ . . . / \mathrm { { m h m } }$ third [makes a note by “impact”]/…/forth [makes a note by “solution”]/…/ehm (.) fifth [makes a note by “conclusion”] (..) sixth (…) [makes a note by “introduction”].

The suggested arrangement evidently differs from the order of the outline. After following the teacher’s re-arranging, the student initiates a request for clarification (line 21), a request that is followed by an orientation toward what writing involves in this setting (lines 22–27). The teacher’s clarification that he has just been giving the order that you write them (line 22) is followed by another request for further guidance (line 23). As can be noticed here, the teacher then refers to two different kinds of arrangements and distinguishes between them by contrasting: (i) the order of the finished report, which follows the order of the outline document; and (ii) the order in which to carry out the study (lines

24–26). In this way, the teacher distinguishes the written document as a product and writing as a process – something that assesses the student’s orientation toward the assignment per se. The student’s confirmation (line 27) displays an instance of joint attention to the doing of the genre.

Consequently, several levels of expectations related to the writing assignment are addressed while the outline document in this example is being oriented toward. With regard to the display of sequentiality, the teacher can address and make available features of the genre that have to do with disciplinary practices. An interrelationship between outlining as practice and the work of writing emerges when the teacher presents his reading of the document in terms of problems and possibilities. As an environmental engineering case, this writing project involves certain ways of carrying out the assignment as well as certain ways of presenting it. However, the formulations in the instructions for this case (Figure 5) cannot be taken as explicit cues for arranging the resulting product at this stage. Instead, they highlight substantial environmental engineering concerns, i.e., disciplinary knowledge, that should be oriented toward and dealt with. In other words, the instructions appear to belong to specific social languages. What needs to be clarified in the student’s situation is how the instructions are connected with the discipline and how they should be handled.

So far, we have followed how the outline document was used as an explicit mediating tool for making a distinction between the process and the product of writing. The ways in which the teacher assumed the responsibility for pointing out what routes could be productive for the writing project invited the student to see what different communicative actions were necessary in order to continue. By making salient the different types of action involved, this encounter points to how the cultural level of knowledge traditions became a concern for the participants, something we will continue to explore in the following section.

# 3.4 Converting topics into issues: tools for making claims in environmental engineering

As practice, the framing of an issue is simultaneously part of and representative of disciplinary discourse. In Prior’s words, writing topics “are not simply organizational schemes or general issues; they include specific propositions, concepts, stories, tropes, images, mathematical formulas, typographic formats, and so on” (Prior 1998: 74). How this comes about in educational settings is an empirical question with relevance for the writing projects investigated here. The previous section showed how aim and method were unpacked as epistemologically charged concepts related to the carrying out and presentation of an academic study. By attending to the particular ways environmental systems analysis is drawn on to frame and establish issues of sustainable development, we will now continue with an analysis of the third typical communicative activity of supervision (see Figure 3) and discuss how key elements of the field emerge and are enacted in our two cases.

# 3.4.1 Introducing the concept of trend

Across our data, the concept of trend is introduced as a resource for making the development of specific phenomena, e.g., air quality, visible enough to allow for decision making concerning measures and policies to manage environmental problems. In Table 2, we will observe how this principle is being introduced and made relevant to the case of air pollution.

The opening turns (line 1–3) of this episode show how trend is introduced as a multimodal resource by the teacher in the interaction. For a start, the emphasis on one of the key points … in all this (lines 1 and 2) reflects the writing project in a general way. It also paves the way for a significant subsequent contribution. As the teacher introduces trend (line 3) as something that needs to be worked out, to come up with a (.) a trend, while simultaneously drawing a line at the top of the student’s outline document. The concept of trend thus emerges as a semiotic artifact with specific uses in this setting. This use, however, needs to be clarified, and the teacher continues by orienting toward the written message in the student’s document and continues his elaboration. At this point, however, the teacher is attending to how a trend can be organized as an argument with particular relevance for air pollution (lines 4–6): ehm so when you are talking about (.) ehm different air quality and different countries (.) developing and developed. This reading clarifies what contributions in the student’s outline are potentially productive for the doing of a trend by privileging different air qualities as well as countries categorized as developing or developed. After locating trend in this manner, the teacher anticipates the way such comparisons count as contributions (lines 8, 10): […] it is helpful both for this section [hand rests at “comparison”] […] and for the whole thing to figure out (.) how (.) how they are developing over time (.). Such a line of reasoning could function as an answer to a question (line 11): is the air quality better or worse now. “Generating data” and “making comparisons” are significant when making claims to knowledge in many disciplinary fields. In this setting such epistemic practices also have the potential for coming up with a trend, a specific developmental path, which in turn is necessary to establish air quality as a sustainability issue and environmental concern.

So far in this episode, the student has followed the teacher’s elaboration by providing minimal responses. Her verbal reformulation of the elaboration from past to now and the future? and simultaneous movement of the hand in a sequence-like manner, bring in chronology and time as relevant contributions to the conversation – something that the teacher confirms by the following evaluative comment (line 18): yeah it’s good to do that.

As can be seen, the presentation of a trend and the work needed to come up with a trend play out as one and the same thing for the teacher in his role as disciplinary expert. Doing the trend is thus introduced as a way of establishing issues of sustainable development. For the novice student, however, this probably has to be clarified further. Conventions for how trends are established and presented in legitimate ways are however introduced as mediating means in relation to the outline document. Combinations of variables, e.g., time and air quality measures in different countries, are elaborated as legitimate bases on which to establish a trend. As these elements are elaborated in this manner, potential access points for the students’ further engagement with the assignment have been established in the interaction. Such a specific way of reasoning and working is explicitly anticipated in the next excerpt.

# 3.4.2 Introducing comparison

Before turning to Table 3, we will briefly recapitulate the previous discussion of how a starting point for the work with this writing project was introduced by means of a contrast between the order of the work required for carrying out the study and the order in which the study is to be presented in writing. The excerpt in Figure 7 showed how comparison was positioned as the first thing for this student to work on (lines 6 and 7): it’s probably fastest to do the comparison first, after which interdependencies between “data” and “comparison” were also introduced (line 11): which is why you need the data.

Interdependencies between “data” and “comparison” and between “comparison” and “trend” (see Table 2) are generally fundamental to the ways in which evidential proofs are made reliable and valid, and for how to establish such relations in text. In the excerpt in Figure 8, we explore how “comparison” is introduced as a mediating means in the case of air pollution. The unpacking of the process continues in this excerpt (line 1), you’ve got to get the comparison first, and what follows in this episode is a joint attention to the function and consequences of comparing: what the student will be able to do as the work proceeds. The outline document is drawn upon in a rich manner at the same time as “comparison” is demonstrated rather than described in the following turns (lines 3–6): once you start comparing (..) you’ll see why/yes/the different methods are important [balancing movement with hands]. As the teacher continues after the student’s affirmative response, he uses the outline to unpack a rationale for the work that is to be carried out (lines 8–14):

once you do that [points to “methods”] and you write about the impacts [moves finger to “impacts”] you’ll know (..) you’ll know how to do this [balancing hands, palm up] and then (.) you’ll be able to come to a conclusion [points to “conclusion”] and then you’ll be able to figure out (.) how to introduce everything.

In this excerpt, comparison is enacted as the work of pairing certain factors, e.g., air quality in different countries, and harmonizing them for the purpose of matching. With this way of unpacking the concept as a resource that gradually leads to successive actions necessary for the framing of air pollution, the teacher

demonstrates how there are links between ways of working and conventional parts of an academic text in this setting. In relation to the outline document, air pollution has to be approached in a specific manner where these links need to be established. Part of what needs to be appropriated for the genre is, in other words, how links are established in environmental engineering and how they are to be presented in text.

Figure 8: (continued)

What is at stake in this episode is how air pollution can be described and understood as a concern for environmental engineering. What is put into play in relation to the formulations in the outline document are the relevant features of the genre that, in turn, offer certain ways of framing the topic in order to be able to produce the evidential proof relevant for making claims and coming to conclusions. The writing assignment turns out to be an argumentative endeavor where substantial contents are to be worked out rather than found and implemented.

# 3.4.3 Introducing modeling

So far, we have illustrated how outline documents were oriented toward while communicating concerns in the supervision session. In the case of international trade, the teacher introduces an additional artifact, i.e., a sketch (see Figure 9), that supports his reformulation of some parts of the student’s textual outline into a model.

![](img/2f8cbdfacc53cf89713ff7257849fa83b2e1edad5f6bb9374ecf66a0359c35f4.jpg)  
Figure 9: Sketch produced by the teacher and used in the session around international trade and sustainable development.

In the excerpt in Table 3, we will explore an episode where the teacher uses this sketch for reformulating this student’s outline document (see Figure 1) into a form of reasoning that is expected and relevant for environmental systems analysis. We enter their conversation as the teacher starts invoking the relevant genre.

This episode opens as the teacher begins reformulating the student’s written account as a model. However, what he attends to is the doing of the model (lines 2–4): you’re creating a model for (..) how eh (.) because you’re you are creating links. At the same time his simultaneous pointing links the resourcefulness of the model to specific categories related to international trade and sustainability: trade, trade institutions, development, environment. However, what concerns this teacher is the work of relating these categories, and the following clarification anticipates possible uses of a model (lines 6–8): and then you can kind of (.) test (.) how how does it work (.) if we change (.) parameter in [points to “Trade institutions”] the model. As the sketch is being used to point to and index relations and variables necessary for communicating and articulating the modeling procedure, it becomes a shared visual field for the participants’ joint attention.

The student’s minimal response is followed by a long pause. As the teacher returns to the sketch and continues, the student interrupts him with a request for clarification (line 12): this is like for say for the analysis then?. The preciseness of this question could be interpreted as if the student places the modeling procedure in a specific part of the assignment. This way of dealing with analysis refers to the model as a concrete object directly transferable to a distinct part of the report.

As the teacher begins to respond, the student interrupts once more (line 14) and recapitulates what was said a few turns previously (lines 16, 18): the one you said just now that if you if you change something/…/that’s the analysis. In this manner, the student’s understanding of “analysis” as an act of modeling is displayed to the teacher. The sketch is then used by the student to separate modeling from the results (line 19): this is still effects I suppose [circles “Environment” box]. As the teacher hesitates, the student slightly alters her contribution (line 21): like the environmental effects in all this. The student thus introduces a distinct and concrete use of the category analysis.

While the teacher on the one hand confirms the student’s displayed understanding (line 22), he re-orients their joint attention by pointing to the question mark between “Trade” and “Development” in the sketch. The teacher emphasizes that analysis is also something that is needed in order to relate “Trade” to “Development” (lines 23 and 24): it takes some kind of analysis to find out (.) how this is linked. Finding out how “Trade” and “Development” are linked introduces another meaning potential of analysis that is relevant for, but not equivalent to, the modeling act. After this, the activity changes and an extended meaning of analysis is elaborated (see Table 4).

Table 4: Elaborating the extended meaning of “analysis”.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Actor</td><td>Verbal action</td></tr><tr><td>26 Teacher:</td><td>eh (..) because it&#x27;s not it&#x27;s not about eh finding facts (.) and then</td></tr><tr><td>27</td><td>eh (.) repeating it</td></tr><tr><td>28 Student:</td><td>hm</td></tr><tr><td>29 Teacher:</td><td>it&#x27;s about finding facts and putting it together (..) so (..) e:h</td></tr><tr><td>30</td><td>(..) eh it is about finding facts about trade, trade institutions,</td></tr><tr><td>31</td><td>how does it work together-</td></tr><tr><td>32</td><td>but already there you have some kind of (.) analysis</td></tr><tr><td>33</td><td>you have to (.) find out okay (.)</td></tr><tr><td>34</td><td>understand okay (.)</td></tr><tr><td>35</td><td>how does this (..) work together</td></tr></table></body></html>

As a response to the student’s somewhat reluctant yeah (.) I guess (line 25), the teacher justifies his earlier statement by claiming that performing an analysis is not equivalent to repeating facts or testing an already existing model. The anticipation of reproduction as a strategy acknowledges the student’s concrete use of the category “analysis” and paves the way for further elaboration. As the student gives a minimal and very quiet response, hm (line 28), the teacher takes on the task of explaining and demonstrating what kind of analysis he is suggesting. In lines 29–31, we can follow how the teacher approaches analysis as practice guided by a rationale. Initially, he struggles somewhat to find the formulations to make such analytical work comprehensible to the student, but soon finds a way of extending the category “analysis” also to an activity of finding out how to establish a model. This kind of work requires reading, finding out, and understanding.

The sense making the participants engage in thus alludes to several meaning potentials of the category analysis. It is alluded to as a distinct text category which should have a certain position in the report-to-be, but also in terms of what doing an analysis implies which is at least twofold. In this case, what he alludes to is that the student needs to work in a context of discovery as well as in a context of justification. The meaning potentials of “analysis,” which are worked out interactively in the activity presented above, point to the situated communicative work needed to distinguish between analysis as a text section and analysis as part of the disciplinary genre.

As we have seen here, the mediation enacted by using a sketch as a material-semiotic resource enables the teacher to intervene in the activity and reorient the student by anticipating and invoking modeling as an analytical approach for investigating international trade.

# 4 Conclusion

Our detailed investigation of supervision at the outline stage has revealed specific features of the challenges involved when students are invited to participate in highly literate, discursive practices. The results have illuminated how supervision around students’ outline documents externalized salient concepts and epistemic practices that were contingent on the field of environmental systems analysis. For students we know that such practices have to be unpacked and made explicit (Dysthe 2002). In our study, we found that supervision around the students’ outline documents provided access points to outlining as an activity to be performed and a study to be pursued. Also, the socially embedded, cultural level of being located in a genre (Bazerman 1997b) was attended to, and made salient through interaction. By emphasizing the function of outlines, the students’ documents became significant resources for introducing relevant academic writing conventions. What is more, they were also used to approach epistemic levels of discursive core events typical for the shaping of sustainability issues in the field of environmental systems analysis.

First of all, our analysis showed how concrete formulations in these students’ outlines were not only addressed as formulations of possible headings for, and organization of, a text-in-the-making, but how they pointed to specific functions contingent on the genre. The outline for international trade was, for example, elaborated as “a plan of the study” and became part of an envisioned practice that might produce an issue. We also found that outlines functioned as resources for reorganizing and arranging work constituted by disciplinary forms of reasoning. One example of this was the sequencing of central methodological steps in response to how instructions for one assignment had been used in the outline document (Figure 7): now that you have written this…you will find it faster to write it not in this order…it’s probably fastest to do the comparison first. While “comparison” was emphasized as a strategic starting point and an important next step in the work to be carried out, “introduction” was positioned as the last step in that sequence. This kind of sequential reordering constitutes a significant step in its own right, since it explicitly draws on and reads relevant epistemic practices into the topics of the outline document. It was a way for this teacher to explicitly address the concern of relating the written instructions for the assignment with the shaping of an issue of sustainable development in the engineering setting. It became salient that it was not enough to follow the sequencing indexed by the written instructions. Instead, and in line with Prior’s reasoning, the topics of the instructions had to be situated and aligned with ways of producing knowledge in the field (Prior 1998: Ch. 3), in our case, of coming up with a trend.

The most salient finding, however, at this initial stage was that outlines were used to separate the shaping of an issue from the crafting of its textual representation. Several examples showed how students’ documents were used to point out the ways in which outlines were resources in the process of shaping an issue, as well as when producing the textual outcome of the writing assignment. Academic writing conventions and features of the specific report genre were explicitly addressed in relation to this separation. Similarly, mediating means attended to such as trends, comparisons, and models, provided potential access points to engage in necessary epistemic practices and rhetorical resources for reasoning and arguing in environmental engineering. These epistemic elements were accordingly made prospectively available (Vygotsky 1978) as part of how outlining was demonstrated by the supervisors.

Taken together, the analyses provide an account of how argumentative functions contingent on the typified practices (Bazerman 1997a, Bazerman 1997b) of the disciplinary field were introduced to students at an early stage. As part of supervision, outlining was a key point for opening the door to environmental systems analysis in that it was an organizing activity for performing, establishing, and presenting issues of sustainability. Challenging cultural levels of knowledge, specific epistemic practices, and ways of reasoning were introduced and interactively oriented to in relation to the material form of students’ outline documents. In other words, the results of this study suggest that advanced literacy processes of this kind do not happen in a vacuum for novices. Written guidelines were, for instance, only partly helpful for the students to grapple with an outline of a report on issues of sustainable development. But supervision provided precisely such a communicative event where the rich flavor of genre and disciplinarity could be addressed beyond the level of artifactual topics, linguistic register, and text type (cf. Wertsch and Kazak 2011). Together with more experienced teachers, the students were explicitly provided with access points to “forms of life, ways of being” (Bazerman 1997a) in a disciplinary field that was yet to be explored.
