# Introduction

Mastering English speaking is challenging for many language learners. The struggle often arises from a lack of practice opportunities, the absence of immediate feedback and foreign language anxiety (Leong and Ahmadi, 2017). Recent years have witnessed a growing number of conversational artificial intelligence (AI) tools designed to improve learners’ speaking. However, their effectiveness is often compromised by their limited intelligence and accessibility. The advent of generative AI (GAI) introduces a new era of GAI chatbots, offering innovative solutions to these traditional obstacles in language learning (Kohnke et al., 2023). One popular tool is Call Annie, an AI video chatbot. Compared to similar tools such as Chat D-ID, Speeko, and ChatGPT with a plugin that primarily provides voice responses, Call Annie can enable users to engage in simulated video calls with AI avatars. Each avatar is trained on a distinct dataset with various conversational styles. This makes Call Annie a more comprehensive GAI chatbot in terms of interaction. Thus, this review discusses its functionality, its affordances in supporting learners’ language development, its potential use in classrooms and its limitations.

# Overview

Call Annie, powered by GPT-3.5, adopts natural language processing and machine learning techniques to maintain a humanlike conversational flow. The app is available on both iPhone operating system (iOS) and android devices and as a web version at https:// callannie.ai/. Given the platform-specific differences in functionalities and interface, our review uses the iOS version as an illustrative example. The interface of Call Annie on iOS devices (iPhone 12 and newer) is like FaceTime (see Figure 1), while the web version and older devices can only perform audio calls for now. Annie, a character set in the role of a 30-year-old woman, is the default speaking partner. Users can select from various characters, each trained with different names, personalities, accents and speaking styles (see Figure 2). A video chat can be initiated by clicking the ‘Call [Character Name]’ button. The AI character (hereafter referred to as ‘Annie’) starts the conversation. If the user responds, ‘Annie’ will maintain the dialogue. Additionally, users can draw inspiration from a list of ‘conversation ideas’ provided (see Figure 3). Users can also change the mode from ‘chat’ to ‘learn’ to practise scaffolded conversations in preset scenarios, but only a limited number of these are available for free. To unlock more scenarios, users need to subscribe to Call Annie Super at a cost of $\$ 11.99$ /month or $\$ 79.99$ /year. Occasionally, a subscription recommendation may pop up within the app. Users can select ‘Maybe Later’ in the bottom-right corner to continue using the free version. This review primarily concentrates on the features of the freemium version.

# Supporting Learners’ Language Development

As ‘Annie’ is based on human language datasets, practising with her is akin to talking with a native English speaker. According to Long’s (1981) interaction hypothesis, meaningful interaction with peers with higher language proficiency is crucial for second language learning. Learners can experience and learn the language as it is naturally used, offering opportunities for negotiation of meaning in open-ended tasks without teacher supervision (Tudini, 2003). It also aligns with Swain’s (2005) output hypothesis since the active language output can lead to language development by helping learners to notice their language knowledge gaps and test their understanding of language rules. An effective method to enhance the learning experience is through a roleplay and simulation approach, which has been demonstrated to be effective in improving students’ communicative abilities (Rahman and Maarof, 2018). Learners can establish a particular scenario to role-play with ‘Annie’ by giving relevant prompts (see Figure 4). One salient problem of ‘Annie’ as an interlocutor is that she tends to give long and complex answers. To remedy this, users can ask ‘Annie’ to adjust her speed, sentence length, and complexity based on their language proficiency levels (see Figure 5). If users encounter confusion, they can also prompt ‘Annie’ to re-explain or simplify the responses. The involvement of learners actively seeking clarification is an important speaking strategy that can contribute to learners’ communicative competence (Lam and Wong, 2000).

Real-time personalized feedback can help learners to identify and rectify issues (Maier and Klotz, 2022). At any point during a conversation, learners can request ‘Annie’ to provide feedback. For example, learners can ask ‘Annie’ to pretend to be an International English Language Testing System (IELTS) examiner and conduct a simulated IELTS speaking test (see Figure 6). After the test, users can ask her to provide a general review of the users’ performance (see Figure 7) and give an estimated IELTS score (see Figure 8). As oral corrective feedback is considered effective in facilitating language learning, users can prompt ‘Annie’ to correct the grammar mistakes in their previous response line by line. On top of that, the machine learning capability of ‘Annie’ can let her recall ‘call history,’ which means that she may detect behaviour patterns in students that they themselves might not be aware of.

As a virtual interlocutor, ‘Annie’ offers a safe and judgement-free environment for language practice. This could significantly lower learners’ foreign language anxiety (El Shazly, 2021). When users express their nervousness between the lines, ‘Annie’ can use morale-boosting words to comfort them (see Figure 9). After users express their ideas, ‘Annie’ can provide inspiring responses (see Figure 10). The emotional support could encourage users to hold positive feelings towards English speaking.

# The Potential Use Within Classrooms

Language teachers can also find ways to collaborate with ‘Annie.’ As self-directed learning is essential in language development, teachers can use a scaffolded approach to motivate students to use the tool in different scenarios (Robinson and Persky, 2020). For example, teachers can help students to develop an individual learning plan with

Figure 9. ‘Annie’ offers comfort to users.

Call Annie by guiding them to set clear language learning goals aligning with the core learning outcomes and give appropriate prompts during interaction. In class, teachers can ask students to conduct role-play activities with ‘Annie’ based on the topic of the lesson. By practising with ‘Annie’ first, students have a low-stakes environment to make mistakes, learn and get feedback before interacting with peers. Out of class, teachers can assign speaking practices for homework to reinforce the skills developed. However, like many other technologies, Call Annie may generate learners’ initial enthusiasm, but whether learners sustain using the tool over a long period is open to doubt. Research should be conducted to understand the actual efficacy of ‘Call Annie’ and other GAI chatbots.

# Limitations

Despite the tool’s potential to augment students’ speaking performance, some limitations exist. First, users need to be aware of the potential security risks associated with data collection and privacy concerns. When users talk with ‘Annie,’ their conversations, personal details, or even sensitive information are potentially logged and stored. Also, as this app requires a large amount of data, it can affect the response time of the conversation. The delay can influence users’ experience, making the language interaction less smooth and immediate. Moreover, the full function of the app is confined to iPhone 12 and newer devices, leading to accessibility and equality problems, and limiting its use in classrooms. In addition, the quality and effectiveness of the interaction between learners and Annie depend highly on individuals and the appropriateness of prompts given. Annie’s tendency to respond with lengthy and complex sentences could overwhelm learners who are new to GAI tools and have not been adequately prepared in prompting (Kohnke et al., 2023). Thus, teachers must be aware of the limitations and offer guidance to facilitate learners.

# Conclusion

Call Annie has the potential to address the common challenges encountered by language learners in speaking by: (a) being a $2 4 / 7$ available English-speaking partner; (b) giving immediate feedback; and (c) providing emotional support. As this review is only based on the function of the tool, further empirical studies are needed to demonstrate the actual effectiveness and sustainability of the tool over a long period. Notably, this review only pertains to the function of Call Annie as of November 2023. We recommend that teachers and students try it out in language teaching and learning.
