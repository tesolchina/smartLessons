# ABSTRACT

After the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, the disruption of in-person schooling has significantly affected many students including emergent bilingual students. Designed as an ethnographic study, this research study examines two Spanish-English dual language bilingual education teachers’ implementation of translanguaging pedagogies and language socialization during the pandemic through the following research questions: (1) What adjustments did the teachers make to their teaching and curriculum to support the students as they navigated the pandemic times? (2) How did the teachers and students use languages in their interaction in blended learning environments? Findings from the $2 ^ { \mathsf { n d } }$ grade Spanish Language Arts and $\bar { \boldsymbol { 4 } } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ grade Social Studies classes demonstrate that both teachers reported an increased awareness of the importance to integrate translanguaging pedagogies and reflected a translanguaging stance. They also intentionally integrated translanguaging strategies into their teaching through translanguaging design. The $2 ^ { \mathsf { n d } }$ grade teacher invited the students to draw upon their full linguistic repertoires for Spanish literacy development, whereas the $4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ grade teacher adopted translanguaging design to make content materials more accessible. Through translanguaging socialization, both teachers socialized the students into and through flexible language use and created a learning environment where students’ linguistic repertoires were valued as a resource for learning.

# Introduction

After the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in March 2020, most school districts in the U.S. shifted to emergency remote teaching, and the disruption of in-person schooling has significantly affected emergent bilingual students, thus leading to amplified disparities in learning outcomes (Department of Education 2021; Sayer and Braun 2020). Research related to emergent bilinguals and their schooling during the pandemic has examined teachers (e.g. Morita-Mullaney et al. 2021), along with bilingual teacher candidates and teacher educators (e.g. Hernandez et al. 2023; Soto-Peña 2020). Most studies discussed teachers’ experiences (e.g. Cushing-Leubner et al. 2021), and little research exists on teachers’ instruction and pedagogical strategies. For example, Crosson and Silverman (2022) investigated teachers’ opinions on how literacy instruction for emergent bilinguals has changed during the pandemic, and teachers reported several barriers (e.g. difficulties accessing materials, technology issues, reduced instruction time) to literacy instruction.

Within the context of dual language bilingual education (DLBE), more classroom-based research is needed to better understand what pedagogical strategies teachers employed to support bilingual learners’ language and content learning during the pandemic. Bilingual speakers are defined in this study as those who can comprehend and produce spoken and written utterances in two (or more) languages with varying degrees of proficiency (Shin 2017). In the U.S., DLBE programs were designed to instruct both native English speakers and speakers of another language in both target languages, and these programs are especially important for linguistically minoritized learners since they have been underserved in schools (Baker and Wright 2021).

This ethnographic study contributes to the field by exploring $2 ^ { \mathsf { n d } }$ and $4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ grade Spanish-English DLBE teachers’ implementation of translanguaging pedagogies and language socialization during the pandemic. I examine what teachers did to support emergent bilinguals through the following research questions:

RQ1) What adjustments did the teachers make to their teaching and curriculum to support the students as they navigated the pandemic times? RQ2) How did the teachers and students use languages in their interaction in blended learning environments?

RQ1 examines curriculum and instruction at a macro-level, and RQ2 analyzes language use during classroom interactions at a micro-level with the goal of linking the findings from the two questions.

# Conceptual framework

In this study, I bring together translanguaging pedagogies (García, Ibarra Johnson, and Seltzer 2017) and language socialization paradigm (Schieffelin and Ochs 1986) as a conceptual framework (Ravitch and Riggan 2012) to examine bilingual teachers’ instruction and their in-class interaction with students. I analyze teachers’ implementation of translanguaging pedagogies through language socialization to examine both macro-level ideologies and curriculum and micro-level classroom interactions.

# Translanguaging pedagogies in DLBE contexts

Translanguaging was first coined by Cen Williams (1994) in Welsh, trawsieithu (as cited in García and Lin 2017). Baker (2001; 2011) translated the Welsh term into English, as ‘the process of making meaning, shaping experiences, gaining understanding and knowledge through the use of two languages’ (Baker 2011, 288). García (2009) defines translanguaging as ‘multiple discursive practices in which bilinguals engage in order to make sense of their bilingual worlds’ (45), thus reflecting dynamic bilingualism. Through translanguaging, the focus shifts from languages to speakers, that is, how they use all the languages to generate and interpret their social context and meanings (Creese and Blackledge 2015).

Translanguaging broadly refers to the complex languaging practices of bilinguals and pedagogical approaches that build upon such practices (Flores and Schissel 2014). Translanguaging pedagogy is ‘a theoretical and instructional approach that aims at improving language and content competences in school contexts by using resources from the learner’s whole linguistic repertoire’ (Cenoz and Gorter 2021, 1). Through translanguaging pedagogy, teachers ‘create spaces where multiple languages are treated as resources for learning’ and promote bilingualism as natural and valuable (Gort and Sembiante 2015, 9). Translanguaging pedagogies challenge language separation in DLBE programs, arguing that learning of and in two or more languages are the very nature of how bilingual think and act (Cenoz 2017; Lewis, Jones, and Baker 2012; Palmer et al. 2014). Translanguaging classrooms are collaborative and student-centered (García and Kleyn 2016), where all languages share an equal status (Fu, Hadjioannou, and Zhou 2019). By inviting bilingual realities into classrooms, translanguaging bridges bilingual learners’ home and school linguistic practices (García and Wei 2014).

García, Ibarra Johnson, and Seltzer (2017) describe translanguaging pedagogy through three interrelated strands: stance, design, and shift. A stance refers to teachers’ philosophical and ideological orientation that bilinguals’ dynamic language practices are resources. Based on a translanguaging stance, teachers should build and incorporate translanguaging into their practice through design. Translanguaging shift refers to unplanned adjustments that teachers make to open opportunities and create a translanguaging classroom. Hence, translanguaging pedagogy incorporates teachers’ translanguaging stance, skillful and intentional design, and collaborative shifts. In this study, I pay particular attention to DLBE teachers’ translanguaging stance and design through the language socialization lens.

# Language socialization in bilingual education

Language socialization explores socialization of members of a social group ‘through the use of language’ and their socialization to use language (Schieffelin and Ochs 1986, 163). Language is the central medium of socialization process (Kulick and Schieffelin 2004), and language socialization is a powerful paradigm to examine how culture and language are produced and transformed across historical, developmental, and interactive time (Riley 2008). Language socialization can occur implicitly and explicitly, and in most cases, both; implicit language socialization occurs when learners perceive implicit sociocultural knowledge, meanings, and values that are transmitted in indirect ways, and explicit language socialization occurs when experts overtly transmit linguistic knowledge (Byon 2003). Language socialization research examines both micro-level interactional practices and macro-level social structures and processes, along with the linkages between the levels (Bayley and Langman 2011; Garrett 2017; Howard 2017), because larger social and cultural dynamics shape what is socialized (Zuengler and Cole 2005).

Language socialization is productive in understanding linguistically and culturally diverse contexts (Bayley 2017). Individuals in bilingual contexts not only negotiate between dominant and minoritized cultures but also synthesize diverse linguistic codes (Kyratzis 2022). These dynamic language practices demonstrate the role of language in relation to cultural identity (Schecter and Bayley 1997) and the ways that bilingual members participate in creative ‘bilingual improvisations’ (de León 2019, 102). Among different cultural groups, schools are considered in language socialization research as integral sites of socialization (Baquedano-López and Kattan 2008) and as sites within society rather than autonomous, self-standing (Mangual Figueroa and Baquedano-López 2017).

Research in bilingual schools has demonstrated how teacher-student interactions using both languages socialize learners to follow certain cultural norms (de la Piedra and Romo 2003). For example, Cho (2016) indicates that repetitive activities and routines help bilingual children learn language and behavior that are accepted, and in educational settings where only one language is privileged for learning, bilingual children encounter a challenge of limited opportunities to explore, use, and present their diverse linguistic repertoires. Similarly, García-Sánchez (2010) argues that educators should value the minoritized languages of learners, because there could be a disconnect when learners’ home language is not incorporated into classroom practice and is treated condescendingly. By bringing together language socialization and translanguaging pedagogies, this study examines translanguaging socialization of DLBE teachers and students in blended learning.

# Methodology

In this ethnographic study, I explored two DLBE teachers’ translanguaging pedagogies and language socialization at Westside School (all names are pseudonyms). Following the local school district guidelines, Westside was fully remote starting from Spring 2020 and ended their school year via online. For the 2020–2021 school year, Westside continued fully online with synchronous live sessions and asynchronous work, and they later shifted to blended learning from February 2021. The data analyzed in this paper is part of a larger project that was conducted over two school years, from 2020 to 2022. This paper reports the findings from the data collected during the 2020–2021 school year, with a special focus on blended learning.

During 2020-2021, I collected the data from December 2020 to May 2021, when the school’s instruction was fully remote and later was blended learning. The school’s blended learning model was composed of synchronous online sessions, asynchronous work, and in-person learning. During blended learning, each class was divided up into two cohorts. One cohort came to the school on Mondays and Tuesdays, and another cohort came on Thursdays and Fridays. Each cohort’s schedule consisted of two-day in-person instruction, two-day online asynchronous work, and online synchronous class on Wednesdays in which both cohorts were combined. For each grade, I followed one of the two cohorts.

# Research setting and participants

Located in a large US Midwestern city, Westside implemented a Spanish-English DLBE program with the goal of educating students to become bilingual, biliterate, and bicultural. In the 2020–2021 school year, Westside served students from preschool to $7 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ grade. Students received instructions in Spanish and English, starting $80 \%$ in Spanish in kindergarten and then $50 \%$ in each language from $3 ^ { \mathsf { r d } }$ grade. Students and staff at Westside were from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds, with one-third of the students identified as English Learners. About two-thirds of the teachers hold at least a Master’s degree, making Westside’s number higher than the average of the district. Most teachers at Westside were bilingual in Spanish and English with several of them from Spanish-speaking countries.

The study was conducted in Sra. Rivera’s $2 ^ { \mathsf { n d } }$ grade Spanish Language Arts (SLA) class and Sr. Martín’s $4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ grade Social Studies class. Both teachers were homeroom teachers1 of the students who participated in the study. In total, two teachers and nine students participated.2 In the 2020– 2021 school year, Sr. Martín was in his ${ 1 0 } ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ year teaching but $1 ^ { \mathsf { s t } }$ year at Westside. Sra. Rivera had taught for 25 years, and the school year 2020–2021 was her $2 3 ^ { \mathsf { r d } }$ year at Westside. Sra. Rivera and Sr. Martín were from Spanish-speaking countries and immigrated to the United States as adults, and they were fluent in Spanish and English.

# Researcher’s positionality

I became interested in bilingual education because of growing up as a multilingual (Korean, Spanish, and English). Such experience led me to study linguistics and pursue bilingual education. My first visit to Westside was in September 2017 during my Ph.D. I volunteered as a facilitator of a university-led professional development (PD) session at Westside. In fall 2017, I conducted two research projects in Sra. Rivera’s $2 ^ { \mathsf { n d } }$ grade class for coursework. I then started another research project at Westside in the $6 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ grade English Language Arts class from Spring 2018 to May 2019. From Fall 2019, I taught an outreach course for in-service teachers at the school district where Westside was located. I continued teaching the outreach courses for two more terms in 2020 and 2021, and several teachers from Westside joined the class. The school year 2020–2021 was my fourth year of interacting with the staff at Westside in several capacities and across various contexts. During that time, I not only learned about the school’s history and listened to teachers’ goals but also observed teachers’ pedagogical strategies and students’ classroom interactions, all of which were foundation to this ethnographic research study.

# Conducting ethnographic research during the pandemic

When Westside shifted to blended leaning, students returned to physical classrooms, but several restrictions were still in place. Everyone had to wear masks, and students had to sit only at their assigned desks and behind plastic shields. Due to social distancing, each student’s desk was several feet apart from each other, and I was told by the teachers to sit at a certain location when I did in-person classroom observation. Consequently, most of the in-person class instruction was composed of large group instruction and individual work, with very limited pair or small group activities. Sharing physical copies of class materials was very limited. Throughout this ethnographic research, humanizing research (Kirkland 2014) has been the core guiding principle for me even before entering the site and to exiting the site. I regularly checked in with the teachers to discuss scheduling and about my presence in their classrooms. As a researcher, I made every effort to follow the guidelines provided by the school district, administrators, and the teachers to respect the policies and procedures.

# Data collection

Data collection and analysis occurred iteratively and dynamically (Heath and Street 2008). Data collection involved multiple data sources at different times and spaces to triangulate and to corroborate findings (Hammersley and Atkinson 2007). The collected data from the 2020–2021 school year include 27 classroom observations and audio-/video-recordings of classroom interactions $( 3 2 \mathsf { h }$ and $2 6 \mathrm { m i n } ^ { 3 } .$ ), fieldnotes taken during observations and interviews (167 pages, single-spaced), 12 semi-structured interviews ( $^ { 2 \mathfrak { h } }$ and $7 \min ^ { 4 }$ ), artifacts including class materials (19 photos), 11 memos (13 pages, single-spaced), and member checks. In addition to semi-structured interviews, several informal interviews were conducted with teachers and students; these interviews were recorded in the fieldnotes and sometimes in the audio-/video-recordings. In the interviews, the participants and I used both Spanish and English flexibly. Semi-structured interviews with teachers were conducted via Zoom, whereas semi-structured interviews with students and informal interviews were conducted in person. I logged all the recordings, and after logging, I transcribed them in the original language of utterance for further analysis.

# Data analysis

Data are analyzed using thematic analysis (Nowell et al. 2017) and discourse analysis (Wortham and Reyes 2015). Thematic analysis was used to identify the emerging themes of what the participants accomplished in their interaction, and discourse analysis was employed to systematically analyze how they interacted. I used ATLAS.ti software, to which I uploaded all fieldnotes, logs, and transcripts. Through thematic analysis, I explored patterns of meanings across the data set, and the ones related to the RQs were analyzed more carefully; I identified, organized, described, and reported the key themes. Using discourse analysis, I further analyzed both language (letters and words) and semiotic media in the classroom interactional data; I gave a close analytic attention to contextualization and indexicals, also analyzing deictic expressions such as pronouns (Wortham and Reyes 2015).

By adapting the thematic analysis presented by Nowell et al. (2017), I engaged in nine phases of data analysis, which included three rounds of coding. In Round 1, I generated initial codes to represent the identified themes using descriptive coding (Miles, Huberman, and Saldaña 2013). In Round 2, I revisited the data and coded all the transcripts using descriptive coding, identifying key themes in relation to the RQs. I also developed a codebook with a list of code groups (e.g. Language-Related Episodes), codes (e.g. metalinguistic talk), and descriptions of each code. In Round 3, all transcripts were again coded using the codes in the codebook.

# Findings

A systematic analysis of the data revealed how the participants navigated their teaching and learning experiences in times of uncertainty, adopting new practices and adapting the existing ones. The teachers had to create materials weekly since not much were readily available for both content and language learning of bilingual students in DLBE programs. The teachers showed increased awareness of the importance to provide relevant education for emergent bilinguals. They also socialized the students into asset-based perspectives, constantly reminding them of what they already knew and could do. While several similarities were noticed in both classes, they differed in their foci. Sra. Rivera’s translanguaging pedagogies focused on language learning, mostly Spanish literacy, while Sr. Martín adopted translanguaging design for students’ learning Social Studies content materials. The following section describes teacher’s translanguaging stance through interview data.

# Increased awareness of relevant education for emergent bilingual learners: translanguaging pedagogies

To uncover the teachers’ experiences and opinions on teaching emergent bilingual learners during the pandemic, I conducted semi-structured interviews with the teachers. Both teachers identified translanguaging pedagogies as the key to provide content and language support for bilingual learners, especially to support them during the pandemic. They both knew translanguaging prior to this study, and they first brought up the term ‘translanguaging.’

# Sra. Rivera $( 2 ^ { n d }$ Grade SLA)

When I asked Sra. Rivera in my interview with her in April 2021 about her experience of teaching bilingual students when the school shifted to remote teaching, she stated that the question was not just ‘how are we [teachers] going to teach the kids’ but also ‘maintain languages [of the students],’ mainly because she and the other teachers ‘want these kids to be proficient in Spanish and proficient in English.’ She metaphorically described the process of creating materials as ‘build [ing] the bicycle as you’re running.’ She first mentioned ‘translanguaging’ in response to my question on how she had provided content area support while also thinking about the students’ language learning. She stated that she has been trying to ‘see where those languages [Spanish and English] converge … and start using that as a connection point more intentionally.’ She continued, ‘There is something that needs to connect … ,and I think translanguaging is going to be that clue for us.’

Several times in the interview, Sra. Rivera underscored the importance of translanguaging by stating, ‘If we really want to get these kids … to find purpose of why they are learning two languages, we really, really need to tap into translanguaging.’ She stated that she has ‘really, really become very intentional on where those [translanguaging] spaces are going to happen’ so that students can connect the languages. She added, adopting ‘more translanguaging practices’ will give so much more ‘breathing space for the kids.’ This was evident in her class, as she often used various pedagogical strategies such as analyzing cognates, presenting real life examples in both languages, talking about bilingualism, inviting the students to not only share their linguistic and cultural knowledge but also learn from each other, and frequently engaging in metalinguistic talk. As a bilingual teacher, she has not only intentionally integrated translanguaging pedagogy into her teaching but also expressed enthusiasm and interest to further advance her practice, as is shown in her response, ‘That part of looking at translanguaging is, for me … I’m going to figure out how I’m going to do this and I’m going to do it well.’

# Sr. Martín $( 4 ^ { t h }$ grade Social Studies)

When I asked Sr. Martín about his experience of teaching blended learning in a DLBE program, he emphasized the importance of prioritizing equity and differentiation so that students who need extra support in language(s) can get it. Similar to Sra. Rivera, Sr. Martín first mentioned ‘translanguaging’ in his explanation of the pedagogical strategies he employed in class during remote and blended learning. When I shared my observation of him using both languages in class materials and instruction, he referred to the school’s PD session5 ,

She [the principal] was saying, … we need to … build a bridge for both languages and help them [students] start doing that translanguaging … so since the beginning of the school year, I was like, I’m going to provide that support. (interview; Jan. 2021)

His exposure to the translanguaging pedagogy at the PD in summer 2020 appears to have had an impact on his teaching, especially because he mentioned the same PD in response to three different questions on three separate interviews.

In the next interview, I asked him if he had used translanguaging or any similar strategies before. He responded that it was ‘not as direct’ when he was in his previous school. He continued,

this time I had more consciousness about the importance of doing so, so I start completing that work … and that really has supported a lot of students, because … sometimes the concepts and the vocabulary in English are not easily understandable for them, so when they come in Spanish that’s extra support that they can receive (interview; Apr. 2021).

His intentional use of translanguaging strategies also appears to have benefited the students in various ways. Moreover, his description of students’ language learning reflected dynamic bilingualism. He stated that bilingual students are ‘building language acquisition with both languages, and they can make those connections, and it’s not just one on top of the other. It’s both hand by hand.’ (interview; Apr. 2021)

In addition to class materials and instruction, he also implemented translanguaging in assessments. He said,

[so that students do not feel] stressed about only having to rely on one or, ‘oh my God, I was studying these in English, but now he [Sr. Martín] is assessing in Spanish, so now I am going to be wrong, because I have no idea what he’s saying.’ So that’s why I want to avoid that situation for them. (interview; Apr. 2021)

Sr. Martín’s interview revealed his translanguaging stance and purposeful translanguaging design of inviting the students to flexibly use languages when learning Social Studies.

As is shown above, both teachers were intentional about implementing translanguaging pedagogies to support students’ learning during remote and blended learning. The need for implementing translanguaging pedagogy became more apparent after the pandemic and motivated the teachers to make conscious effort into implementing it. Most importantly, returning to class after a prolonged period of distance learning made students’ learning progress and their needs more evident.

# Socialization into asset-based perspectives through purposeful translanguaging design

Both teachers not only demonstrated a strong translanguaging stance but also socialized the students into a translanguaging stance so that they view their language learning from asset-based perspectives (Smolcic and Martin 2019; Zoeller and Briceño 2022). Teachers drew on students’ full linguistic repertoires and recognized them as resources for language and content learning. Translanguaging design, especially purposeful integration of translanguaging pedagogical strategies, was very evident in both classrooms. Through translanguaging pedagogies, the teachers socialized the students into and through flexible language use. In both classes, language and content learning was done by flexibly using both languages in speech and in class materials. In the following section, I present classroom interactional data among teachers and students to show their language use and socialization.

# Sra. Rivera’s $2 ^ { n d }$ grade SLA class

Sra. Rivera considered students’ linguistic knowledge as a resource for learning languages and guided the students to recognize the resources that they have. She repeatedly reminded the students the knowledge they had gained over the last few semesters in their online learning and at home, with the goal of shifting the students’ views of themselves and their language learning from deficit to asset-based perspectives. When I asked her how she supports students’ learning both languages, she responded, ‘with the cognates … is the idea that … you may feel that you don’t know a lot of Spanish. Let’s think about what do you know and how you can connect this language that you’re trying to learn.’ (interview; Apr. 2021) This shows her emphasis on assetbased perspectives in learning and her enthusiasm to guide the students to tap into their linguistic knowledge.

Her belief about languages and language learning is reflected in her teaching, and the selected event below is an example among many similar instances such as the classes on compound words and speech parts. In one class (3/18/2021), Sra. Rivera said,

… en el salón, estamos aprendiendo cómo entender palabras en inglés y palabras en español. Somos bilingües.   
Hablamos dos idiomas, y yo tengo estas palabras aquí.

(… in the classroom, we are learning about how to understand words in English and the words in Spanish. We are bilingual. We speak two languages, and I have the words here.)

Then she put up on the board a poster with cognate words in English and Spanish:

Informar Inform Persuadir Persuade Entretener Entertain

She invited the students to be ‘detectives,’ asked them to identify the letters that are similar and different between the cognates, and asked for volunteers to share their observations. Among the students who raised their hands, Sra. Rivera first invited Ana to point at the letters that are similar. The following excerpt begins when Ana walked up to the board to identify the shared letters in informar and inform:

<html><body><table><tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>Original Utterances.</td><td>English Translation.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Sra. Rivera</td><td>Mira a ver para que veas lo que penso, lo que penso.

Transcript 1.

Sra. Rivera told the students to pay attention, listen, and see what Ana ‘thinks’ (line 1). Ana pointed at the letters of the Spanish word ‘informar’ (line 2) and read aloud the letters in Spanish (line 3). Sra. Rivera responded to Ana’s observation (line 4). Ana then pointed at the letters in the English word ‘inform’ (line 5) and said the letters aloud (line 6). Sra. Rivera again said $' _ { 0 } \boldsymbol { \mathsf { k } } ^ { \prime }$ (line 7) to acknowledge what Ana shared. Ana added ‘eme’ $( m )$ (line 8) and pointed at the letter $' \mathsf { m } ^ { \prime }$ in both ‘informar’ and ‘inform’ (line 9). Sra. Rivera gave praise to Ana (line 10), as Ana went back to her seat.

After several students took turns pointing at the shared letters among the cognates, Sra. Rivera told the students:

Mira estas palabras … .Hay niños en mi salón que me dice, ‘Ay, Señora Rivera, yo no entiendo español,’ o ‘Señora Rivera, yo no entiendo inglés’

(Look at these words … .There are some students in the class who tell me, ‘Oh, Ms. Rivera, I don’t understand Spanish,’ or ‘Ms. Rivera, I do not understand English.’)

In her talk, Sra. Rivera mentioned what the students might have been thinking, that is, that they did not understand English or Spanish. While she acknowledged such thoughts, she encouraged the students to shift to a more asset-based perspective by looking at the cognates closely.

At the end of the class, Sra. Rivera reminded the students the value of what they already knew and invited them to recognize their knowledge as resources:

Yo quiero que tú hagas esta conexión. Pon tu dedo en tu cabeza y piensen en esta conexión … .Put your finger on your head so that you can think about this connection … . En inglés y en español, hay muchas palabras que son iguales, y yo sé que algunos niños … llegaron a la escuela el año pasado y no tuvimos más escuela y tú dices, ‘Ah, el inglés y el español, se me olvidó. No sé qué voy a hacer.’ Yo quiero que tú vayas pensando en todas estas palabras que están en español que están en inglés y vamos a hacer una conexión … .Vamos a hacer un puente de una palabra en español a una palabra en inglés y de una palabra en inglés a una palabra en español.

(I want you to make this connection. Put your finger on your head and think about this connection … .Put your finger on your head so that you can think about this connection … .In English and in Spanish, there are many words that are similar, and I know that some kids … came to the school last year and we haven’t had more [inperson] school afterwards, and you say, ‘Ah, English and Spanish, I forgot. I don’t know what to do.’ I want you to start thinking about all the words in Spanish that are in English, and let’s make this connection … .Let’s build a bridge from a word in Spanish to another word in English, and from a word in English to a word in Spanish.)

She reminded the students and emphasized,

Tú tienes un cerebro bilingüe. Vamos a usar estas palabras que sabemos que están en español y son casi iguales en inglés, o está en inglés y son casi iguales en español.

(You have a bilingual brain. Let’s use these words that we know that are in Spanish and are almost the same in English, or [the words] in English that are almost the same in Spanish.)

Her comment echoes the importance of empowering students by emphasizing the value of being bilingual.

This event is one example that demonstrates Sra. Rivera’s translanguaging stance in her instruction. She encouraged the students to recognize linguistic assets they have and underscored how much they, being bilinguals, already know and can do. She explicitly socialized the students into an asset-based approach to language learning, maybe with an intention to shift the students’ views from thinking what they do not know to recognizing their knowledge as resources. She also used multiple modes including gestures when making connections.

Moreover, she took a step further and connected her instruction to their situation of resuming inperson classes after several months of remote schooling. She acknowledged students’ concern by stating that they might think that they do not understand Spanish and English, might have forgotten them, or might not know what to do due to being at home for a prolonged time. She added that some students came to this school the previous year and did not have much in-person schooling afterwards. To them, Sra. Rivera repeatedly emphasized how much they knew and presented ways to use that knowledge for learning. This extended sequence demonstrates the collaboration among Sra. Rivera and the students in their learning the two languages creatively.

# Sr. Martín’s $4 ^ { t h }$ grade social studies class

In the $4 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ grade class, Sr. Martín socialized the students through flexible language use, also instructing them to use both languages for learning. He prepared all the materials in both languages to not only facilitate students’ learning Social Studies but also to make the content more relevant and accessible for all students, thus reducing any language-related barriers. He also frequently reminded the students that they could use any languages. For example, when providing the materials, he said,

Chicos, está en inglés y está en español. Page number two, they are in Spanish … .Si quieres leerlo en español, puedes leerlo en español.

(Guys, it’s in English and in Spanish. Page number two, they are in Spanish … .If you want to read it in Spanish, you can read it in Spanish.) (4/26/2021)

As is shown, he told the students that they could read and write in either language based on their preferences.

After an activity such as independent writing or a quiz, Sr. Martín frequently asked the students to share. For example, in one class (5/24/2021), the prompt for the activity was the following, which was projected on the board:

After five minutes of silent writing, Sr. Martín asked students to read aloud their responses:   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Prepare your pencil and notebook/Prepara papel y tu cuaderno</td></tr><tr><td>Why it is important to learn how to manage money? What could be the negative consequences if you don&#x27;t learn about this?</td></tr><tr><td>iPor que es importante aprender a manejar el dinero? fQue consecuencias negativas pueden suceder si no aprendes esto?</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

Transcript 2.

Sr. Martín asked the class in Spanish what they wrote, and in response, Immanuel raised up his hand (line 1). Sr. Martín invited Immanuel to share (line 2), and Immanuel started sharing in English (lines 3-4). Sr. Martín then continued probing Immanuel to further elaborate his response (line 7), to which Immanuel answered (line 8), and Sr. Martín acknowledged (line 9). This and the following excerpt demonstrate the flexible language use in Sr. Martín’s class.

Most of the flexible language use was by Sr. Martín. However, the students also translanguaged as in the following excerpt (5/24/2021):

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td></td><td>Original Utterances</td><td>English Translation</td></tr><tr><td>1 2</td><td>Sr. Martin</td><td>((pauses the video that is in English)) So chicos, primera gran idea, primera gran idea.</td><td>So guys, the first big idea, the first big idea..</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td></td><td>iPor que los humanos pelean y han ido a guerras por el oro?</td><td>Why do humans fight and have done wars for gold?</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Marcela</td><td>((raises up her hand))</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Sr. Martin</td><td>Marcela</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Marcela</td><td>Porque tenia muchos like, am, values.</td><td>Because it had a lot of like, um, values</td></tr><tr><td>7 8</td><td>Sr. Martin</td><td>Por que le daban valor?</td><td>Why was it valuable?</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Marcela</td><td>Porque estaban bonito.</td><td>Becuase they were pretty.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Sr. Martin</td><td>jEstaban bonito!</td><td>They were pretty!</td></tr><tr><td>10 11</td><td></td><td>That&#x27;s it!

Transcript 3.

The video (line 1) was part of the material provided by the district. Most of the material were in English, and Sr. Martín often translated them into Spanish for the students to access in both languages. While the video was in English, Sr. Martín asked the question in Spanish (line 3). Marcela started her response in Spanish, and later used the word ‘values,’ which was mentioned in the video (line 6). Sr. Martín asked a follow up question in Spanish (line 7), asking why gold had value, to which Marcela responded in line 8 that ‘estaban bonito.’ Sr. Martín gave an affirmation in English that Marcela’s response was correct (line 10) and reiterated why humans like gold (line 11).

Line 11 is not a direct translation of line 9, which was ‘bonito’ (pretty), but a further elaboration of the idea. Transcripts 2 and 3 show not only Sr. Martín’s explicit and implicit socialization through translanguaging pedagogies but also bidirectionality of socialization with the students.

Sr. Martín intentionally used both languages in his teaching and assessments so that students can demonstrate their knowledge using their full linguistic repertoires. Based on the interview data, students also found the flexible language use beneficial. For example, to my question on what she thinks about Sr. Martín’s use of both languages, Marcela responded, ‘it’s good because I can speak to him in both languages … he can understand’ (interview; May, 2021). For Sr. Martín, the integration of translanguaging pedagogy appeared to be a way to make the classroom learning more accessible and equitable to support all students and their learning the languages and content materials, that is, for the students to recognize how much they know in Social Studies and to be able to demonstrate their learning. By repeatedly telling the students to use both languages and modeling translanguaging, Sr. Martín socialized the students into dynamic and flexible language use. Sr. Martín and the students drew upon their full linguistic repertoires in their teaching and learning Social Studies.

Findings from the two classrooms demonstrate that both teachers reported increased awareness of the importance to integrate translanguaging pedagogies and intentionally implemented translanguaging strategies in their teaching. The teachers socialized the students into and through flexible language use, thus creating a learning environment where students tap into their linguistic repertoires as a resource for learning. While the two classes differed in their foci, the students and the teachers collaboratively created a learning environment that is relevant to them as they adjusted to new norms.

# Discussion

The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak presented unprecedented challenges, even more so to emergent bilingual students (Sayer and Braun 2020), and the disruption of in-person schooling forced changes to classroom practices. Situated in a context that necessitated immediate adaptation with limited resources, this study indicates that both DLBE teachers faced challenges in teaching, and such experience led to purposefully implement translanguaging pedagogies as they adjusted to the new environment. The teachers became more reflexive about what matters for bilingual students, examined their practices, identified students’ needs, and made necessary shifts. The teachers’ translanguaging pedagogies were characterized by the interwoven strands (García, Ibarra Johnson, and Seltzer 2017) that are a foundation to a translanguaging classroom. Both teachers demonstrated a strong translanguaging stance in the interview and the classroom data, and they intentionally designed the lessons for the students to use their linguistic repertoires. Rather than adhering to strict language separation, the teachers both explicitly and implicitly socialized the students to value bilingualism as a resource through repeated routines (Cho 2016; Moore 2011), and several students translanguaged in class.

Translanguaging socialization into translanguaging stances, that is, embracing translanguaging in homes, communities, and for academic work at schools (García 2020), is valuable. In this study, I use the phrase translanguaging socialization to refer to a conceptual framework that brings together language socialization and translanguaging pedagogies and provide an analysis of the empirical data. I draw upon the translanguaging socialization framework to examine the complexity and dynamic nature of how bilingual teachers and students adjusted to the new environment, including the teachers’ rapid and radical adaptations that required incredible effort and modification in pedagogy. Language socialization is productive to examine translanguaging classrooms for several reasons; to highlight, language socialization research (1) examines the beliefs on language, culture, and learning of teachers and students, (2) explores socialization over time, (3) analyzes multidirectionality among students and teachers, and (4) connects micro-level interactional data to macro-level processes. Translanguaging socialization, therefore, explores developmental processes of socialization through and into the linguistic and cultural realities of bi/multilinguals, including their use of full linguistic and cultural repertoires along with multimodal resources in interactions (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Translanguaging socialization.

Translanguaging socialization can be both implicit and explicit. Regarding implicit translanguaging socialization, for example, both teachers socialized the students through flexible language use, and it was observed more frequently in Sr. Martín’s class. Explicit translanguaging socialization was observed in both classes but in different ways. Sra. Rivera explicitly instructed the students to recognize their linguistic knowledge, as well as guided them to draw upon their full linguistic repertoires in learning SLA. On the other hand, Sr. Martín explicitly told the students to use both languages in learning Social Studies and in various types of assessments. Through such socialization, teachers socialized the students through and into bi/multilingual realities and bridge school, home, and communities (García and Wei 2014), and teachers and students collaboratively created a translanguaging classroom (García and Kleyn 2016).

# Future directions for research and pedagogical implications

Future studies on translanguaging socialization can analyze sense-making through linguistic and multimodal resources (e.g. images, videos, gestures), because translanguaging includes both (Li Wei 2018). More studies can examine multidirectionality in translanguaging socialization among bilingual teachers and students by also analyzing students’ peer interaction. Research on multidirectionality can be beneficial in exploring power interplay in interactions. Studies from a critical approach can uncover how languages and cultural practices – and consequently their speakers – are positioned in each social group by connecting the findings from micro-level interactions and macro-level implications of social justice.

For pedagogical implications, translanguaging pedagogy can support bilingual learners by providing language and content support, reducing language-related learning barriers, and making learning more relevant and equitable. Regular reflections on pedagogical goals and strategies can be beneficial for teachers to adapt their practices and support emergent bilinguals in today’s ever-changing society. Simply using the materials in two languages may not be enough, but rather, teachers should develop and model critical awareness for equitable learning environments. Teachers should invite each student’s expertise into classrooms by drawing upon their full linguistic and cultural repertoires so that students’ learning can be enriched as they learn with and from each other.

# Notes

1. Homeroom teachers at Westside took attendance and provided various support including communication with the students’ family members.   
2. For participant recruitment, potential teacher participants received informed consent individually via an IRBapproved online electronic-signature platform to sign electronically. In case of the potential student participants, a student assent in English and Spanish was provided, along with a parental permission form in English and Spanish, via an IRB-approved online electronic-signature platform.   
3. $^ { 1 0 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ and $1 5 \ \mathsf { m i n }$ were in 2nd grade, and $^ { 2 2 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ and 11 min were in 4th grade.   
4. One semi-structured interview of 43 min was conducted with Sra. Rivera, and two semi-structured interviews (13, $2 6 \mathrm { \ m i n } ;$ ) were with Sr. Martín. With the students, each semi-structured interview was about five minutes.   
5. The researcher was not part of this professional development and did not attend it.
