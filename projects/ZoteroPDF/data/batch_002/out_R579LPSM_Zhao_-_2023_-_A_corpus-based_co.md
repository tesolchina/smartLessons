# 1. Introduction

One of the richest strands of EAP writing research in recent decades is that examining construction of academic identity. In an influential series of studies, Ivanic (1994, 1998) usefully proposed that acadmic witr identit construction can be studied from four perspective. Amongst them, the self as author"perspective reflects the writers active inolvement within the texts (Ivanic, 1998, p. 23). And in this paper, it is one salient identity representation means of "self as author (ibid) - the use of firt-person pronouns in academic writing, that I will be mainly concerned with.

As the importance of this rhetorical device in academic writing has become increasingly wellrcognized, research on first-person pronouns has steadily increased in recent decades. Important early examples include Graetz's study (1985; quoted in Swales, 1990) of personal pronoun usage in 87 abstracts, while more recent studies include Tang and John (199) and Leedham and Fernandez-Parra's (2017) study of authorial identity, Hyland's (2002) study of discourse functions, and Cao and Xiao's (2013a) study based on Multidimensional Analysis (MDA) approach.

Generall, the first-person pronouns have been the focus of an increasing amount of research in both international and Chinese EAP communities (Cao & Xiao, 2013a). However, few studies have focused on this specific linguistic feature in the genre of RA abstract. In addition, most preious stdies have fused n arlatively narrow section f dscilies and this s partiully true for the filds of Finance and Economics, with which I am involved as an EAP teacher at a Chinese universty specialing in these fields. There is also a clear ned for more comprative stude, espiall for the gnre of astract. Inttioll, tere hae thus far been quite few studies of this comparative nature; and while this perspective has been more popular among Chinese researchers, the studies carried out to date have been lacking in depth and sophistication.

This present study reports on a large-scale comparative corpus study of English-language abstracts, taken from English-language and Chinese-language academic journals respectively. This research intends to find out to what extent and how Chinese abstract writers use the first-person pronoun - we, in ways that are consistent with, and thus likely to be deemed acceptable by, their international academic peers; especiall for the disciplines of Finance and Accounting the two most important sub-disciplines in the Social Science disciplines of Economics and Business). Particularl, this study will focus on the phraseological patterns f the first person pronoun - we. Several studies (Charles 2006; Gledhil, 2000a, 200; Myers, 1992; Oakey, 2002) have already demon. strated that academic dicourses often have quite conventional phraseology, while\*miscollocations or collocations uncommon for the ere may affect the inelligility of the aper nd may reuc it efftiveess Hwarth, 1998, qutd nMriez, 2005, p. 187).f first-person pronoun usage among Chinese Finance and Accounting academics is indeed found to be different from international norms, as indirectly measured by paterns in major English-language journals, the qualitative perspective provided by my analysis of Chinese and English-language usage pattrns may be of considerable pedagogic as well as theoretical value to Chinese Finance and Accounting academic writers.

# 2. Review of related literature

Amongst the numerous ways in which writers can express themselves to readers (cf. Hyland, 1999; Huston & Thompson, 2000), perhaps the most obvious and significant way is through the use of first-person pronouns (Hyland, 2001, 2002; Kuo, 199; Tang & John, 199). By their very definition, personal pronouns are explicit markers of the identity roles that writers assume in thir texts. Previous research on the use of first-person pronouns in English academic writing has primarily focused on their usage and discourse functions in genres such as research articles and/or students theses (e.g. Kuo,1999; Hyland, 2001, 2002; Harwo0d, 2005a, 2005b, 2005c; Martinez, 2005; Samraj, 2008; Leedham and Fernandez-Parra, 2017). Some of these studies have centered around one single discipline, such as Harwood's (2005a) focus on computing science and Martinez's (2005) focus on biology; others are comparative stdie acrossdifferent academic disciline . Harwo0d, 2005b, 2005c; Hyland, 2001; McGrath, 2016; Samraj, 2008) These studies have provided important insights in four main areas: discourse function (e.g. Harwood, 2005a, 2005b; Hyland, 2002; Kuo, 1999), authorial identit (e.g. Ledam & Fenandez-Para 2017; Tang & John, 199), semantic reference (e. Harwo0d, 2005c, Kuo, 1999; Molino, 2010) and/or distributional frequency (e.g. Hyland, 2002; Leedham & Fernandez-Parra, 2017).

About the discourse function studies, Hyland (2002) has proposed five discourse functions in the rhetorical devices accompanying first-person pronouns. These include "explaining a procedure, stating results/claims, elaborating an argument, stating a goal/purpose (and) expressing self-benefits" (ibid, p.1100). Tang and John (1999) have set up a scale with six categories evaluating the singular pronoun I from having the least powerful to most powerful authorial presence (p. 29) in students' academic esays. Along somewhat similar lines, Leedham and Fernandez-Parra (2017) examined the authorial dentities of we and I across Chinese, Greek and British students Engineering assnments. In semantic rference studies, most scholars have distinguished the semantic referents of we and/or our in simple binary terms as either inclusive or exclusive' (e.g. Harwo0d, 2005c; Zhang, 2008). However, a more sophisticated approach has been developed by Kuo (1999), who distinguishes five referent identties fr the plural pronouns we, our and us each of which has at last one istinct discourse function. I distributional studies, L2 writers of English have been found to under use or even entirely avoid using irs-person pronouns in their academic writing, in comparison with the L1 writers of English (Hyland, 2002; Martinez, 2005). However, other studies focusing on EFL students have produced contrasting results (Leedham and Fernandez-Parra 2017; McCrostie, 2008), that English L2 student writers sem to use more irst-person pronouns and that their self as author identities are therefore much more overtly present in their writings" (Luzon, 2009, p. 194).

While les attention has been paid to first-person pronoun usage in abstracts, there have been a few noteworthy studie over the last two decades. Stotesbury (2003),for example, has studied and compared reporting verbs collocating with the plural pronoun we in abstracts across three academic disciplinary domains. Another study of abstract in the Chinese Aplied Linguistics communit is Zhang's (2008) comparative study of English abstracts written by L1 and L2 English (Chinese) writers. Zhang found that 1 writers of English tended to use both the singular pronoun I and the plural pronoun we more frequently than Chinese writers did. Zhang also found that thre were significant differences in the discourse functions of these pronouns, espcill in terms of the usage of the plural first-person pronoun we.

In summary, previous research presents a mixed picture regarding first-person pronoun use in English academic writing in general and more specificall in relation to RA abstract writing. This uncertainty i reflcted in the fact that there are some very conflicting views about pronoun usage in academic writing currently in circulation. The traditionalist view is that academic writing should always be \*author-evacuated, in Geertz's (1988) terms. Likewise, the American National Standards Instute (ANSI, 1979) suggests that it is unnecessary for writers to reer to themselves in abstract. ven Graetz (1985) state directl that the astrct genre is characterized by the use of ... third person, ..." (p.125).

On the other hand, some other academic discourse scholars have pointed out that such prescriptive advice is routinely contradicted by academic writers across the disciplines - afrequently-cited case in point being the first sentence of arguably the most famous scientific research paper ever published (Waston & Crick, 1953, p.737): \*We wish to suggest a structure for the salt of deoxyribose nucleic acid (D.N.A.)' - and argue against the prescriptivist view that using personal pronouns makes academic texts sound inap. propriately casual' or informal' in tone (Mills & Water, 1986). As Swales and Feak (1994, p. 20) put it:

.. most of our recommendations are designed to help you maintain a scholarly and objective tone in your writing. This does not mean (and we have not said) that you should never use I or we in your writing. The use of I or we does not make a piece of writing informal.

Hence, while afew recent studies (e.g. Hyland 2002; Luzon, 2009) have shown that there is considerable variation in conventions for pronoun use across disciplines, there is nevertheles a growing consensus among EAP researchers that the traditional view of academic proe s author-evacuated is far toosimplistc. It isincreasingly recognized for example by Hyland (2002 p.1094), that the use of first-person pronoun \*is a powerful means by which writers express an identity by assertig their clam to speak as an authority". In particular, English profesional writers are increasingly using first-peron pronouns as self-promotional means, to induce readers to continue reading their research articles or persuade journal editors to accet their artices in an ever-increasing fierce publication environment (Alharbi & Swales, 2011; Harwood, 2005b; Yakhontova, 2002, 2006).

However, Hyland (2002) also points out that making effective and appropriate use of this rhetorical resource may pose particular difficultie for scholar from L2 English speaking backgrounds, \*whose rhtorical identities may be shaped by very different traditions of literacy. (ibid: 1092).

The hypothesis that Chinese abstract writers will thus for various reasons be likely to avoid first-person pronouns, especially the plural one- we, in their abstracts seems to be well upported by previous research; Zhang (2008), Ding (2009), ha0 (2011), Cao and Xiao (2013a, 2013b) and Peng and Zhang (2017) among others, have all found that in English language abstract writing, Chinese writers use fewer firstperson pronouns than thir English-language peers do regardles of the discipline. Therefore, this paper, as a corpus-based study, intends to find out whether Chinese writers like their Chinese academic pees from other academic disciplines, also circument the usage of we in their abstract writing. Specifically, this reearch willgo into more qualitative detail, exploring and comparing this pronoun in terms of is collocates and the commonly used phraseological paterns in which they participate across two corpora.

In this study, I focus my examination of the first person-pronoun based on the genre of abstract. In adition to the above-mentioned reason, there are actually two ther important reasons. First, it i not unusual for journals published in language ther than English to expect the author to write an English abstract of their article" (Lore, 2004, p. 281), and this is certainly the case in the Chinese ac. ademic context' and the context that the present study focuses on. Second, English written abstracts are crucial in determining a research article's readabilit as well a its acceptaility among it tagt audience (Hyland, 2004) in this sese, the English abstract is significant in helping to guarantee that the reported results of scientific work will crculate worldwide (Ventola, 1994, quoted in Lores, 2004, p.281). Since 2012, the Chinese National Social Science Fund has atempted to promote the internationalization of some top Humanities and Social Sciences academic journals.? One of the most important aspects of this process is the English-language abstracts in Chinese-language journal articles published in national academic journals (Salager-Meyer, 2014; Shen et al., 2010). While the preence of Eglis-language abstracts in non-Angophone journals is nothing new in itel, it has been given a massive boost in recent years by the ever-widening online accessto academic texts provided by retrieval systems such as EI Compendex (Sala ger-Meyer, 2014). It i also, through these platforms that Chinese scientific achievements can be discovered by intenational academics who might otherwise be totally unaware of them (Jin et al., 2004). As Swales (1990, p. 7) points out, \*publication can be seen as documentary evidence that the writer qualifies for membership in the target discourse community'. There is now growing evidence that Chinese academics and institutions have a much more internationally-oriented view of what academic discourse communities they wish to be regarded as members of than was the case in the past.

As an academic writing teacher in a top Chinese Finance and Economics university, I am keen to help Chinese Finance and Accounting academic writers (beginning from my colleagues) to improve their English abstracts writing proficiency, with the ultimate aim of raising their awareness about how the abstract writing practices can be brought more into line with the expectations of international audiences, enhancing the otential for their work to be disseminated to worldwide audiences. Given the rapid development of Chinese economic srength in recent years, I hope that such empirical reearch would help match the internationalization process of Chinese Finance and Accounting acknowledgement and academic publication.

# 3. Data and methods

# 3.1. Data

As mentioned above, I compiled two corpora for the current research, and these two corpora willbe referred to as the English. language Journals Corpus (henceforth EJC) and the Chinese-language Journals Corpus (henceforth CJC). I full understand that the writers who have published rearch articles in the English-language journals studied in this paper are not all 1 writers of English, as my research is not intended to compare between the L1 users of English' and L2 users of English Rather, my interest les solely in comparing the usage of we in RA abstracts from English-language journals with English astracts in Chinese-language journals.

The EJC and CJC contains 400 abstract texts each,selected randomly from a representative range of English-language and Chineselanguage journals in the fields of Accounting and Finance. For the selection and confirmation of source journals used in this study, consulted a series of primary bibliographic databases and journals official wesites. I then selected and collected the most prestgious English-language Accounting and Finance academic journals. With these journals I believe that these researchers writing conventions are positivelyassociated with the academic journals' qualities and that they can therefore be regarded as a valid international norm for comparison (cf. Cao & Xiao0, 2013a; 2013b). As for the Chinese journals selection, I verified indexed Chinese Finance and Ac. counting academic journals using thre authoritative Chinese guidebooks. At last I decided to select Finance (twelve journals altogether, with 200 abstract texts) and Accounting (six journals altogether, with 200 abstract texts) journals with various impact factors (cf. Ca & Xiao, 2013a), so as to represent the full range f academic English writing levels amongst Chinese writers (A fullis of the journals can be found in Appendix A).

Having identified a selection of relevant journals, I then randomly selected English abstracts for my corpus. From the publication years of 2013 and 2014 (assuming that there would be no great change of academic writing style in Finance and Accounting in recent years), I had a relatively balanced selection of astract from the joumals' original reearch articles. The total number f abstracts for EJC and CJC sub-corpus was 40 respectively. The final dataset contains total 102, 203 word tokens, almost equally distributed be. tween the EJC and CJC, as can be seen in Table 1.

# 3.2. Methods

Of the full range of frst-person pronouns in English (i.. I, me, mine, my, myself, we, us, our, ours and ourselves), the first-person pronouns we and our are most frequent in my data. The others either occur infrequently (and wellbelow statistical significance according to a log-liklihood test, or do not occur at all In JC, there is no instance of me, myself or ourselves, my occurs only 14 times and there are mere 3 instances for us. Similarly, in CJC, there is no instance of me, my, or myself, 7 instances of $I ^ { 5 }$ and $u s$ , and only 1 instance of ourselves). These results are in line with previous studies by Hyland (2001, 2002) and Martinez (2005). As for the posessive pronoun our, though the frequency f occurrence i higher than other first-person pronouns, i is sill much lower than we: there ae only 194 instances in EJC and 109 in JC. Such low frequency leads to a much les significant disparity in terms of overall frequency comparison; at the same time, there is nothing particularly important and noteworthy about the phraseological pattrns in the EJC versus CJC comparison. Taking these into consideration, in the research, I wil limit myself to examining and comparing the first-person pronoun we only.

Considering that the comparative and contrasting analyses of we are between EJC and CJC journal abstracts, I then conducted a Mann-Whitney $U$ test to determine and ensure whether the similarities/differences, especially the frequency of this pronoun, is caused by any specificjournal and/or groups of writers. After the statistical comparison of data, the final rsults turned out tobe that the pvalue of contrasting between the two groups of writers (EJC versus CJC) is significant, which means that this variation is language specific, rather than journal specific.

The analysis of we willbe based on three separate forms of comparison: a rank and frequency comparison, a comparison of statistical collocates, and a comparison of the phraseological pattrns most commonly used by English and Chinese academic writers in the corpus. For all of the three comparative and contrasting studies, I used the corpus tool of AntConc 3.5.7 (Anthony, 2018)

Here, I want to further explain the search of phraseological patterns in my study. As both the EJC and CJC were small corpora in terms of word tokens (see Table 1 above), they are not amenable to some popular approaches to phraseological analysis, notably lexical bundle analysis (e.g. Biber & Barbieri, 2007; Cortes, 2004), which loos for exact repetitions of multi-word strings and thus requires much larer corpora than mine to yield sufficient results for the urose of meaningful analysis. Therefore, in this study, I decided to adopt Gledill's (200, 200) altenative pproach to phraslogical analysis to examine the patterns. Gledhill's aproach involves identifying colocations of grammatical words, which of course occur frequently even in very small corpora. Basing searches on grammatical words is not just a matter of quantitative convenience, however, asGledil (ibid) points out, grammatical words are also interesting in their own right asthey have particularly significant role in the construction of idioms, sentce frames and collocatios: \*high frequency items . are embedded in set phrases which have rhetorical frce" (Moon, 1992; quoted in Gledhil, 2000, p. 117). Therefore, though there is a widely-held belief that grammatical words are not as fruitful as lexical words as astarting point for phraseological reearch, Gledill (ibid was sill able to identify a very large number of interesting and nteworthy lexico-grammatical characteristics by means of a phrasological description f a set of grammatical words found to be statistically asociated with different moves in scientific research articles. On essentially the same basis, I was able to examine and identify some interesting phraseological patterns based on we, in my corpora of abstract texts.

Prior to this study, I completed a rhetorical move analysis fall the English-language abstracts in EJC and CJC. Each abstract was manually annotated wit the help f the UAM corpus ool (version 2.8; ODonnell, 2012), fllowing Swales and Feak's (2009) abstract five-move model. This rhetorical move analysis lays a foundation for the current study of phraseological pttern of we as wel, mainly in terms of their move distribution and discourse functions.

# 4. Analysis of we in EJC and CJC abstracts

# 4.1. Rank and frequency comparison

Table 2 shows that we is the 8th most frequently occurring word in the EJC $( \mathrm { N } = 7 9 2 )$ . This word is almost evenly distributed across 333 abstract texts among the 400 abstracts written by English Finance and Accounting writers In the 400 Finance and Accounting research articles in EJC, 64 of them are single-authored and 336 are multi-authored. Thus, from above mentioned raw frequency and distribution observations, we can tell that multiple-authored articles are more common than single-authored artices in the English. language academic journals. However, for the greater use of we in the EJC RA abstracts, it may also indicate a tendency among the EJC writers to use this pronoun in a more general sense - the use of inclusive we, to state their research ideas. The inclusive we, as Harwood (2005c, p. 365) argues, could help \*create a positively polite tenor of solidarity" in the discourse community. The inclusive we is hus employed in EJC to set up readers involvement: the reearch as join efforts by both the writer(s) and the readers smingly. Due to the same reason, such utilization could also better promote writer(s)' claims and/or findings to putative readers and/or members of Accounting and Finance academic community.

Turning now to the data for the CJC, the most obvious point to note is that the rank position of this pronoun is lower than its EJC counterpart. We appears in only 151 out of the 400 RA abstracts in the CJC, and with a total frequency of occurrence of 259 it occurs almost three times less frequently than it does in EJc10. In other words, the vast majority (about $8 5 \%$ ) of English writers in EJC choose we to represent their authorial selves in their abstracts and on average, we appears twice in each abstract text. In contrast, only $4 0 \%$ of Chinese writers in CJC ever use we in their abstract writing, and this pronoun only appears in the CJC at a rate of 0.65 occurrences per abstract text. Similar to the research articles in EJC, there are 98 single-authored and 302 multiple-authored articles in CJC. We might assume that with almost the same number of multiple-authored abstracts, Chinese academic writers could use similar number of this pronoun we (or only a little less to represent themselves in their abstract writing; however, quite ierent from our previous assumption, it sems that Chinese Finance and Acounting writers use much lessthis lural pronoun, regardessof multiple- or singleauthored written articles. Instead, they would adopt some other writing skill (e.. passive voice) to circumvent ths pronoun, whether it is in a general sense or a specific sense.

In summary, then, from the perspectives of word frequency and ranking, we are able to deduce that present-day Chinese academic writers in the fields of Finance and Accounting are - as hypothesized earlier in this paper - reluctant to use the pronoun - we, to represent themselves in their abstract texts, in comparison to their nglish-language academic pers. This is despite the fact that some (perhaps even a substantial number of these rearchers have come to the knowlege tha i is perfectly pemissible to use the pronoun and to represent their own identities explicitly when writing for audiences in a much broader academic community.

This result is also in line with previous findings i comparative studies of research articles in general (e.g. Molino, 2010), and of the genre of the abstract in particular (e.g. Van Bonn & Swales, 2007; Zhang, 2008; Friginal & Mustafa 2017; Peng & Zhang, 2017) Previous studies have also fered various reasons for ths apparent dispreference. These include the desire to maintain objectivit in scientific writing (Cao & Xiao, 2013a; 2013b), an adherence to outdated academic writing guidelines (Zhang, 2008; Peng & Zhang, 2017), a culturall-motivated aversion to sef-promotion in academic writing (Hyland, 2002), and/or the local preferences of particular academic disciplinary communities and/or of the specific genres in which academic writers are composing (cf. Luzon, 2009). A more dtailed discssion of the possibl rsons for this and other discrancie relating to the use of we willbe provided later in this paper, after we have loked in more detail at the collocates and phraseological patterns asciated with this pronoun.

# 4.2.  Collocates and phraseological patterns with we

The top ten raw frequency 0-3R collocates11 of we are given in Table 3.

Although these data are, strictlyspeaking, nothing more than single word co-occurrence observations, they could provide some basic information for further understanding about the phraseological behaviour of we in the EJC and CJC. In both the two disciplines of Finance and Accounting, academic writers in EJC and CJC share the first thre collocates as that, find and the, and their ollocation strengths are also strong, which indicate that these three words have close connection with we. Specificaly, in EJC, the presence of the words that and whether indicates that we is frequently followed by a finite subordinate clause in Finance and Accounting abstracts written by English academic writers, as listed in Table 4.

a For the collocation strength, I used the Log-Likelihood as the means for statistical significance test. I set a minimum Log-likelihood threshold confidence level of $\mathsf { p } < 0 . 0 5$ , which meant that any item with a score below the critical value of 3.84 would fail the statistical significance test.

Table 4 Two finite clause phraseological patterns in EJC.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>we</td><td>we [VERB] that ....</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>we [VERB] whether ..</td></tr></table></body></html>

The verbs that most frequently follow we are find, show, examine and proide, al of which are in the present tense. Thus, from these verbs collocates, we might presume that frequently used phraseological patterns in EJC could be ${ \pmb w e } +$ find/show/examine/provide $^ +$ that/whether. Except for such clause paterns, the presence of the determiners the and a indicate that direct objects also frequently follow we in EJC. Another interesting and noteworthy word is the only noun in the top ten collocates - evidence. And later in this section, I will examine and discuss this specific collocate in more detail.

Turning now to the top ten collocates of we in the CJC, the most immediately striking observation is that the frequencies and range for all colocates are much lower than in the case for the EJC data. However, this i only to be expected, given our previous oservation that we is itself much les frequent in CJC than it is in EJC. On looking at the data in more detail, I note first of al the prevalent cooccurrence f tht, once gain indicating that we is most ommonly followed by a finite subordinate clause. However, the word wheter, Which in EJC appears 45times to the right of we, does not even figure in the top 10 for CJC. This suggests that while Chinese abstract writers in Finance and Accounting journals do know and use the pattern we [VERB] that .. a their English-language peers, they hardly ever use another finite subordinate clause pattern.

From a comparison of verb collcates, it would seem that Chinese writers make a wider range of choices than do their English. language peers, at least at the top ten of the frequency range and collocation strength for each group as shown here. However, compared with their nglish-language prs, Chinese Finance and Accounting researchers hardy use the collcate show with we, and this ssue needs further exploration in order to find out whether there are phraseological pattern differences.

Similar to EJC abstract writers, Chinese writers in our corpus employ the same phraseological pattern as we [VERB] a/the, which shows a preference for we followed by direct object. The same as in EJC, I wl also pay special attention to the verb selections in this pattern in CJC, to see whether 1) the verb selections are confined to the above mentioned six verb collocates, 2) there are some similarities/differences in the verb selections between EJC and CJC.

I now turn to specific phraseological patterns that accompany we. The five most commonly used phraseological patterns for we in the EJC are presented in Table 512

From Table 5, we note that the first and the third most common patterns for the usage of we are we $^ +$ (also/do not/further/ generally) find $^ +$ that and we $^ +$ (also/further/then) $^ +$ show $^ +$ that. These two patterns appear 291 times in total. These two phraseological patterns appear primarily in the result' move in EJC abstract text, and are both used to state the writrs' empirical results, as shown in Example 1. Accounting writers seem to have a particular strong preference for the pattern $\pmb { w e } + \pmb { f i n d + t h a t }$ while Finance writers use both of the two. These two paterns reflect the brevity of abstract writing (Swales & Feak, 2009): professional writers use we to represent thir stance, and the following finite subordinate clause states their reearch findings in a compact and direct way.

When stating the research results, the pattrn we find/provide and the noun evidence are also prevalent. This pattern has two main variants as: we $^ +$ find/provide $^ +$ (little/some/substantial/strong) evidence $^ +$ that and we $^ +$ find/provide $^ +$ evidence of/for/ consistent with/on. These are shown in Examples 2a-b.

Drawing on the first-person pronoun discourse function classfication schemes proposed by Kuo (199) and Hyland (2002), the above-mentioned phraseological patterns found in the EJC can be classfied as relatively typical example f stating/showing results or findings" in academic discourse (Kuo, 199, p. 130; Hyland, 2002, p. 1099). According to Hyland (2002: 1104), \*Ip]ledging your personal conviction in your results with a first-person commitment is a risky strategy", but apparently, writers who publish their research articles in the most prestigious English language academic journals have such confidence in their ideas and control of their arguments, and hence \*they are best able to explicitly foreground their distinctive contribution and commitment" (Hyland, 202, p. 1103). An important part of this, I ould argue, involves usig self-reference statements such as we find/show that., w ind/provide evidence that ...

Returning to Table 5 above, we note that there are two other phraseological patterns featuring we that are frequently used by EJC abstract writers: we (also/then) examine whether/the/how and we study/investigate/analyze/test/propose. These are the most frequently used patterns in the purpose' move in EJC abstracts. These patterns have the discourse function of \*stating a goal or purpose (uo0, 199, p. 130; Hland, 2002 p.1099). In both of thee ptns, the EJ writer are quit flexible in their ver selection, so long as these verbs can briefly and positively express their research intentions. We also note that English Finance and Acounting writers use the signal words whether and/or how as well a that with vers such as examine and/or investigate in subordinate clauses (as seen in Example 3).

# Example 3.

Let us now compare and contrast these phraseological observations with those obtained from the CJC. Similar to EJC academics, Chinese Accounting and Finance academics use we most frequently in result' and purpose moves (as 140 and 65 times). However, there are significant differences in the phraseological patterns. Table 6 shows the most commonly occurring patterns featuring we in the CJC.

The first and the fourth phraseological pattrns in Table 6 (we (also/can't/further) find/found that and we (also/only) find/ found a/the/out/evidence) are the most commonly used paterns featuring we in Chinese writers 'result moves. However, in comparison with the EJC patterns shown in Table 5, we note that there is one missing patter from the EJC. This pattern is we (also/ further/then) show that, which i the second most common pattern adopted by English academic writers in the result moves. In the entire CJC, there are only two instances of this pattern. These are we show that .. and we innovatively showed the ..

On closer investigation, however, it turns out that Chinese writers do use this phraseological pattern, but with different collocates - or more specificall, with other subjects instead of we. When stating their research results, Chinese academics prefer not to express their own agency or identity, instead using the noun result(s) as the subject of the clause: "\*result(s) show(s/ed) that .. There are 97 such sample in the CJc,13 even with a higher frequency than the pattern we find that in the CJC. This contrasts very strongly with Finance and Accounting researchers in EJC; when the English academic writers do opt to use result(s) instead of we as the subject of ther result-reorting clause, they are more likely to co-seect the verb ug than sHow, . results sgest that.., rather than the CJC-preferred result(s) show(s/ed) that ....

It would therefore seem that the Chinese writers in our corpus mix two common and popular phraseological patterns in their academic abstract writing. Although the two patterns of result(s) show(s/ed) that .. and results sugest that . are completely appropriate in academic writing, the two reporting verbs exhibit some certain diffrences: practicall, the word show is a more assertive reporting verb, while suggest is a more hedged expression. This Chinese writers' mix and preference may be attributed to their unfamiliarity with hedges and boosters, and also reporting verbs' collocates with different sentence subject. Altenatively,this phraseological preference could be due to first language influence; in Chinese, the two words (Biaoming) and/or  (Xiansh) both share the meaning of show and usuallycollocate with the word (Jieguo), meaning result. Some Chinese writers in CJC may directly translate their astracts from Chinese into English, and hence would choose the corresponding word show rather than some perhaps more internationally commonplace collocates.

Meanwhile, from another perspective, we note that Chinese writers are reluctant to use the first-person possessve pronoun our, even with such an evaluatively neutral collocate eult(s). gain, a ontrast with EJ i instructive here there are8 instances of our results suggest that ... in the EJC, but only 8 instances of this phraseological sequence in the CJC.

# Example 4b.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Our results suggest that insiders of foreign firms believe that the regulation makes the extraction of value from minority investors more difficult and costly for them.</td></tr></table></body></html>

Examination and comparison of collocates and commonly-used phraseological patterns of our in EJC and CJC also verifies above mentioned phenomenon. The most commonly used pattern revealed by the phraseological analysis of our in EJC features one of the nouns result(s)/indings/evidence, followed by sugest and a finite subordinate clause, as our result(s)/findings/evidence suggest(s) that. In addition, the second frequently used phraseological patterns with our in EJC finds that thee professional writer tend to have their own set patterns. For example, our results are robust, usually appears as the last sentence in result moves and functions as an alternative form of verification of research results. The pattern our findings are consistent with performs primarily as aconnection between purpose' and result moves. In contrast, Chinese writers prefer definite articl the or zero article to the possessive pronoun our: the phraseological patterns of our in CJC are insufficient in both the frequency and the use.

From both the we and our phraseological pattern comparison, we could see that there is a distinction between promoting the researcher (as we show that and/or our results sugest that) versus promoting the research itself (as results show that). It may be the case that Chinese writers are inclined to be less overtly self-promotional' in their abstracts, and are thus attempting to make a more implicit case for their research. However, as self-promotional trategies are becoming an essential part of contemporary academic communication (Hyland, 2002), Chinese writers should atempt to overcome any aversion they might have towards personal forms of expression.

Let us now consider the fourth commonly used pattern among Chinese writers isted in Table 6 above, we (also/only) find/found /the/out/evidence. This pattern tends to feature nouns or noun phrases as direct objects. While two commonly used phraseological patterns in result move in EJC, namely, we ind/provide evidence that and we find/provide evidence of/for/consistent with/on, are not found at all in the CJC. Once again, Chinese writers appear to be drawing on a relatively narrower range of lexicogrammatical resources to express their stances, especially so when it entails using this first-person pronoun as the sentence subject.

In relation to purpose' move, it would seem that Chinese writers share similar writing conventions with their English-language peers. Both prefer to use the phraseological patterns we investigate and we examine, and both are quite flexible in their selection of verbs in addition to the words investigate and examine, Chinese writer aso used verbs such as test study and analye). uzon (2009) showed that expert writers used highly conventionalized patterns based on we + verbs to state their research purposes, and that the most frequently chosen vers in this patten resty, lye, proose nd idnif. It would sm that on this occasion, Chinee writers in CJC follow closely high frequency phraseological patterns instating their research purposes. However, the English writers in EJC have a statisticall significant preference for the pattern we examine whether/the/how.1 They only used the verb investigate as a supplement (following anintial ver setion such as stdy, nyze ec.). In comparison, Chie writer semtotret we investigate and we examine as iterchangeable in purpose' move statements. While this may not actuall seem incorrct or unidiomatic' to an international or L1 English reader, my analysis does show that such lexical co-selections are divergent from the English-language writing convention, and may thus contribute - even if in a small and imperceptible way - to an overall impression on the part of an international or L1 English reader that Chinese abstracts are written in a different and unusual way.

Another difference lie in the rammatical objects typicall following these verbs. English writers in EJC either elect the + noun/ noun phrase or whether/how + subordinate clause, depending on the levelof detail they wish to present in their tatements relating to their research purposes, as shown in Example 3 above. Chinese writers, in contrast, use the $^ +$ noun/noun phrase following those verbs principally.

# Example 5.

And then we investigate the value premium in these three emerging markets, 1 (2013)/Studies of International Finance/Finance in CJC

Before moving on, there is another significant difference revealed by the phraseological analysis of we. In allof the five patterns identified in Table 6, Chinese writers tend to a greater variety of verb tenses than English-language peers do. In particular, I find a mixture of simple present, simple past and even present perfect forms distributed fairly evenly across abstract moves. While English writers in EJC may also use verbs in the present, past and present perfect tenses in astract writing, they do not normally use verbs in either the past or the present perfect tense in opening statments. Instead, they tend to use verbs in an assortment of tenses to describe events that happened in the past, such as a financial crisis happened in the past. This form of usage resonates with some findings from previous comparative studies of leaners and expert writers (e.g. Luzon, 2009), which found that while expert writers kee to one kind of verb tense according to the specific genre/move they are writing in, learner writers tend to drif almost randomly between tenses.

# 5. Probable reasons for writing differences

One explanation put forward by Cao and Xiao (2013a, 2013b) for the Chinese writers reluctance to use first person pronouns lies in the "rules for astracts and abstracting (G6447-1986), which is the Chinese national guidelines for writing academic astracts. In this set of rules the emphasis s on the objectivity of the material presented in abstract, and there are explicit requirements to use the third person pronouns wherever possible.

Abstracts should be written in the third-person tone. Descriptive approaches should be adopted to indicate the nature of the primary document and the document subject such as \*research has en carried out ., \*the tatus of .. has been reported', and "investigation has been conducted to .." etc. (rules for abstracts and abstracting, GB6447-1986, 6. considerations for abstracts writing)

While this explanation is ifficult to prove directly, the analysis presented here more generally has provided empirical evidence that Chinese writers in our corpus use self-reference forms much les frequently than do their English-language peers in EJC.

Another possible explanation is that Chinese Finance and Accounting academic writers seem to be unaware (or at least insuffi ciently aware) of the increasingly promotional role that the first-person pronouns are starting to play in contemporary academic discourse (Hyland 2004; Hyland & Tse, 2005; Van Bonn & Swales, 2007). To borrow terms from Yakhontova (2002), Chinese writers seem to prer telling toselling by ther astracts. However, the pressure t sell is far grater in the intenational academic writing and publishing context. Under such circumstances, languages utilized in English abstracts should be instrumental in hooking' (or failing to hook) their readers (Hyland, 2004). It seems that when Chinese writers write English abstracts, they do not always bear in mind that they are no longer writing solely for local readers.

This might also explain that in their hinese-written astracts, they usuall adopt \*this research', this papert, and \*researcher(s)" such kind of subjectsto refer to the Chinese writers themselves. These writing conventions have remained when transferring to their English-written abstracts, hence, we seldom see the Chinese  inluences on the adoption (and/or non-adoption) of we in their English abstract writing (even, sometimes Chinese writers would adopt the passve forms, such as it is presented in this paper, rather than adoption of active voice we). However, when it comes to the collocates and phraseological patterns of we, there are actually some influences from the Chinese language, such as Chinese writers' interchangeable use of investigate and examine, and the mixed two phraseological patterns as we (also/further/then) show that and result(s) show(s/ed) that. When it rfers to direct translation (or combination of writing and translation) of astracts, some Chinese writers would select corresponding words, rather than internationally acepted collocates and/or phraseological patterns. And this kind of frst language influence may provide certain explanation for Chinese Finance and Accounting academics' different phraseological patterns from their English-language academic peers.

In recent years some Chinese ingusts have begun to realize the positive value of using first-person pronouns in academic abstract writing, as practiced in international academic discourse communities. These scholars have argued in particular that frst-person pronouns can make abstract texts more concise yet more convincing and persuasive (e.g. Teng & Tan, 2004; Zhang, 2008); yet such opinion holders are few in number. And my study here suggests that in the international Finance and Accounting academic communities at least, English academic writers are certainly more inclined touse first-person pronouns to expres their views. Thus, I hope that my study could help raise more Chinese academics' language awareness of the first-person pronoun usage intheir English academic writing.

Editors in some Chinese Finance and Accounting journals might not realize themselves and/or indicate to the academic writers about English language writing conventions, and indirectly causing such salient diffrences as discussed in this paper. Thus, it is equally important to raise Chinese journal editors' English language awareness, upon detailed insights and descriptions provided by corpus-based research such as that caried out for this paper. They, together with academic writers, should understand that self. promotional strategies are an essntial part of contemporary academic communication. By now, some English editors in prestigious Chinese academic journals have realized this issue and would help examine and edit the English abstracts.

While the last probable explanation could be that EAP writing training is inadequate, and that there is thus an urgent need to acquaint Chinese academics with the writing conventions now practiced and accepted by international academic communities. There therefore it needs to be proactive and explicit encouragement for Chinese academics to adopt current first-person pronoun usage patterns and to make correspondingly lessuse of passive and impersonal constructions in academic writig. Yet, as Salager-Meyer (2014, p. 81) has argued, academics working in non-anglophone countries should not be expected to figure out how to write abstracts by themselves; rather, \*universties should .. be responsible for trining researchers . to become acquainted with the culture of academic publishing and written communication skills.. both in the scholars L1 and in English." Given this, EAP writing teachers eed to help ther students to develop a better awarenes of such lexico-grammatical usage and patterns and to writ in a manner that adheres to abstract writing conventions. One feasible solution might be appropriate revision and adoption of we and we-statements based on Chinese writers' initial writing/translation versions (based on the advancement of on-line translation toos). EAP writing teachers thus need to undertake and/or draw inspiration from investigations, assimilate their findings and come to some form of consensus i formulating ways and means of writing updating among Chinese academic writers. Generally, I do hope that the detailed picture presented by researches such as this one could be of practical interests to EAP practitioners whose task is to help their students write abstracts in ways which will help them to participate full in their international disciplinary discourse communities.

# 6. Concluding remarks

In this research I have conducted a corpus-based comparative study of first-person pronoun - we, in English language abstracts published in English and Chinese-language journals. The aim has been to investigate whether and to what extent the usage of this firstperson pronoun by Chinese abstract writers correspond to English-language conventions in the fields of Accounting and Finance.

Overall I found that Finance and Accounting academics in EJC not only adopted larger numbers of this pronoun than did Chinese counterpart, but they also utilized more varied and sophisticated collocate and phraseological patterns associated with the word we

In the last section, I have also briefl discussed and offered some possible reasons for the ifferences that my research has found. Some of these reasons have been from a macro perspective, noting such things as the possble influence of national abstract writing conventions; others have been from a more micro perspective. I do concede that these discussions have been brief and speculative and do not in themselve answer the underlying question of why Chinee writers wite abstracts as they do, but hope that the discussions will act as a catalyst for further rearch into the isues. Specificlly, further reearch extending analysis scope to English abstract writing from other academic disciplines, which could help find out whether there exist disciplinary differences for the first-person pronoun use; and/or even beyond the genre of abstract, to other English written sections from the whole academic texts, which could help find out whether there exists consistency/alteration in Chinese writers usage of the we pronoun. In such cases, I do hope that these future exploration and investigation willalso contribute to the goal of improving Chinese writers academic English writing.

In general, this paper has contributed new knowledge to the now burgeoning sub-field of EAP study focusing on the research article abstract gere. This study sill has a number of limitations, such as only one language featre focused specificll. Nevertheles, given the rapid development of Chinese academic research in recent years, I believe that my research findings could help to raise Chinese academics language awareness and then familiarize them as wellas journal editors, EAP teachers the intenationally acepted norms and conventions in academic abstract writing, may play a role in helping Chinese academics to disseminate their research more widely, and then to become more fully integrated into their international academic discourse communities.
