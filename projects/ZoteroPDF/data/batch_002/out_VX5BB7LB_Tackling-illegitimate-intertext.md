# ABSTRACT

Handling Editor: Guangwei Hu

Without proper guidance, some graduate-student writers can misstep and break with the sourceuse conventions of their disciplines in various ways, including acts that could be considered plagiaristic. Many universities attempt to reduce such missteps with published definitions of plagiarism, guidance in formatting styles, and training in discrete writing skills such as paraphrasing and summarizing; however, the persistence of illegitimate intertextual practices suggests that the issue might be more complex than simple ignorance of conventions or lack of writing skill. This paper reports on a five-year action research project that sought to explore illegitimate intertextuality in research proposals submitted by the members of five diverse cohorts of social science graduate students near the outset of their studies. Data were collected through Turnitin. com similarity reports, discussions with students and instructors, submitted written assignments, and a survey. Over the five years, the project evolved away from simple definition and skillbuilding toward a focus on socializing students into an academic community of practice. The findings from this project suggest that the core of the issue may be that students hold fundamentally different conceptions of the role of sources in academic texts to those held by their more experienced discourse-community mentors. These results have implications for the training of graduate students in writing in their disciplines, suggesting it may be better to start with the "why" of citation, before moving on to the "what' and the "how."

# 1. Introduction

Members of an academic community who conduct reearch must do so within the "larger narrative" (Hyland, 1999,p. 342) of the research being conducted in their discipline. As a result portion of every research paperthe size of which varies from disciline to discipline, jounal to journal, and write to writerframes the target study in terms of the extant literature in the feld. Experts in academic discourse, who are fullparticipants in their academic or disciplinary community of practice (CoP; Wenger, 1998), become very skilled at weaving their own research stories around a framework of existing reearch, situating their own contribution to th field in the constelltion of contributions that have come before. However, neophytes to an academic CoP may struggle to achieve such skillful integration of source texts.

This study covers a five-year action research (AR) project to explore how successive cohorts of graduate students understood the role of source texts in their own writing and the expectations of the academic community in regard to intertextuality. There is a wealth of research on the struggles of neophytes as they take their first tentative steps toward an academic CoP, where they become involved in the community enterprise of research and knowledge creation (Belcher, 1994; Dong, 1996; Lei & Hu, 2019; Zhang & Hyland, 2021)

This iterature is clled upon at dfferent points throughout this paper to shed light upon the challenges faced by several cohorts of graduate students. After a brief review of iterature on intertextuality and an explanation of the context and methodology of the project, the remainder of the paper is organized according to the three cycles of the AR projec I conducted. ach cycl is elaborated upon in turn complet with its ow riew of iterature, to crt timelin f the entire oject. This ornzation, which differ from the traditional organization of a research paper, illstrates how each cycle of an AR project can be seen as a study unto itelf as, between cycles, the goals of the project shift and evolve in response to deeper understandings of the problems faced in the contexts explored.

# 2. Intertextuality

Intertextuality is a defining characteristic of writing in academic discourse communities and has been defined by De Beaugrande and Dresser (1981) as \*concern [ing] th factors which make the utilization of one text dependent upon knowledge of one or more previously encountered texts." However, the form of intertextuality that was the focus of this project is ased on Pecorari and Shaw's (2012) four categories of legitimate/illgitimate intertextuality. The firs two categories of intertextuality (indirect and conventional) represent legitimate and sanctioned forms of intertextuality. The third and fourth categories (unconventional and deceptive) represent the illetimat forms of intrtexlity, wth the k fference ween the tw being the intntion t die the rder in deeptive intertextuality. As noted by Pecorari and Shaw, the intention to deceive is often difficult to ascertain beyond any reasonable doubt however, a direct and unsignaled relationship with a source text, if discovered by a reader, can have significant consequence for any writer, including student writers. Therefore, this AR project sought to understand the motivations behind instances of illgitimate intertextuality in student writing and to deploy educational interventions to reduce such instances.

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. The context and participants

The context for the study is a graduate school that awards degres in an interdisciplinary field in the social sciences. The student body is international, with representative from various countries. For example, in 2023, the incoming cohort of 105 students consisted of representatives from 35 countries. The majority of students hold undergraduate degrees in social science fields, with a large contingent of economics majors. Almost al students are returning to academia after period of time working in the professional world. Incoming students are required to take a placement test of academic writing. Those who score below a threshold core on this test are required to enroll in English for Aadmic Purposes (EAP). This course underwent many changes throughout the period f the AR project it bean with dicrte grammar and vocabuly exeries and evolved to incude short writing exercs and uthentic-txt analysi exercises. There isignificant variation in English proficiency among the incoming students, with some clasifiable as B1 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) scale and others being native speakers; however, most students are class. fiable as 2 or 1. As illtimat intrxtualit is sesitive iue, for reasos rela  confdentiality, a thorough decrition of the context and participants is not possible.

# 3.2. Data

# 3.2.1. Turnitin.com similarity reports (TSRs)

Data for this study were collected from a number of sources. The first data source was Turnitin.com Similarity Reports (TSRs) produced for student submissions of a two-to three-page research proposal. TRs are very imprecise measures of intertextualit as the software can only measure matching text. Whether that matching tex is a result of intertextuality (legitimate or illeitimate) is a matter that could only be decided after further investigation involving thesource texts and the writer. However, TSRs were the metric routinely used by faculty to determine i intertextuality issues were resent, and a mandate of the course was to reduce the amount of matching text, especially extreme cases (over $4 0 \%$ ; therefore, TSRs were chosen as a pertinent data source.

# 3.2.2. Field notes and survey data

The other sources of data were field notes from interactions with tudents nd teachers during the duration of the AR project s wel as data from a survey conducted online using Google forms with students in the third and final cycle of data collction (2021). The purpose of the survey (Appendix A) was to compare the students experiences in the EAP course with their previous education in academic writing, to ascertain if and to what extent ther ideas about source-use and plagiarism had changed, and to investigate if they felt that they were a member of a research community. The survey was sent to the last cohort of students afer the completion of ther studies. The survey, which included an informed consent section and a number of open questions regarding the course, was sent to all 17 participants in one section of the EAP course. Eleven participants responded, making the response rate $6 4 . 7 \%$

Much of the early feedback from students and teachers was collected in informal discussions inside and outside the classroom. The feedback was entered into my notes as it was given or soon after.

# 3.2.3. Writing task

The final source of data consisted of responses to a culminating writing task in the latest iteration of the EAP course. These responses were analyzed for the degre to which the students had synthesized a number of source texts (rather than simply summarizing

them), and this information was compared with the amount of matching text in the student responses to ascertan if there was any clear relationship between synthesis and re-use of text from source texts (this willbe explained in Cycle 3 of the AR project below).

# 3.2.4. Informed consent

Permission to use TSRs for the six cohorts in this study and the writing task in the third cycle was obtained following institutional policy. In addition, students were informed that an AR project was underway and that clas discussins and consultations with their instructor could be reported in publications related to that project. Finall, as the survey conducted with the 2021 cohort was not covered by the institutional policy on consent, a dedicated informed consent form was created and distributed to the students.

Fig. 1 illstrates the data collected throughout the duration of the study, including the 2013 data, which was used as a baseline for the study. Table 1 contains the sample sizes per year.

# 3.3. Action research procedures

Wallace (1998) described AR as "systematicall collecting data on your everyday practice and analysing i in order to come to some decisions about what your future practice should be" (p. 4). This AR project began with this modest goal. While the initial project was visionss (1946 fl in rn, deftg, afr h first  f th t, Ellts revised version of Lewin's model of AR (se Fig. 2) was chosen. The rationale for this choice was that, i Elliot's own words, Lewin's model can \*allow those who use it to assume that the general idea can be fixed in advance (Elliot, 1991, p.70). However, afer the frst cycle, as wil be seen below, it beame clear that the gener idea that had driven the first cycle was ineffective and "should be allowed to shift' (Elliott, 1991, p. 70).

Another advantag f Ellott's model i the recurring reconnaissance stages, which involve not only reflction but also analysis. hus. following variation theory (Lo & Marton, 2012), I analyzed the intended (learning goals), enacted (teaching activities), and lived objects (student experiences of learning through curriculum document, in-clas discussions with students, informal discussion with other teachers, and surveys. Where a mismatch was found among the objects of learning, I created a general plan (Ellitt, 1991) the action steps consisted of creating learning materials to address the mismatch and deploying those materials in class.

Each cycle of this project began and ended wit selfreflection (McNiff& Whitehead, 2002) in an efort to understand why students might engage in illgitimate intertextuality. Self-reflection was demed likely to provide valuable insights for thre rasons: a) my years of working with the students in this context would provide insights not available to visiting researchers (as well as biases); b) having travelled a similar path as my students (re-entering the academic world after a period in the professional world),I had faced many of the challenges that they were facing in their ttempts to come to terms with the expectations of an academic CoP; and c) as the designer of the teaching materials, I was able to evaluate the extent to which the action steps had been implemented (Ellot, 1991) through my discussions with teachers and students.

# 3.4. Limitations

The AR project, which was implemented through an EAP course, was designed to tackle llegitimate intertextuality at the institution under study; however, this course was not the only initiative undertaken to tackle this sue. At least one other course also discussed issues related to aademic inteity. In addition, as the dat rresent onsecutive cohort, there is no pre/ost measurement of the students' development in thir understanding of appropriat intertextuality and no way to allow for inter-cohort dierences in ability. Therefore, any decreases inillegitimate intertextuality could have been a result of a number of factors. The comparisons between the students who took the EAP course and those who did not go some way toward isolating the impact of the course, but a direct cause and effect relationship between the course and the observed outcomes is difficult to confirm.

# 4. The action research cycles

In this section, the three cycles of the AR project are reported. For each cycle (2017/2018, 2019/2020, and 2021),Elliot's (1991) reconnaissance, general plan, action stes, monitoring of effects, and second reconnaissance (explain any failure) are explained.

# 4.1. Cycle 1 2017/2018 - reconnaissance: fact finding & analysis

Reconnaissance for the first cycle involved an analysis of TSRs and field note as well as insights from scholarly literature. It began with the baseline data from 2013, as program-wide data were not available for AY2014-2016.

# 4.1.1. Cycle 1 TSRs

The circumstances in which thefirt iteration of the EAP course was implemented suggested that illegitimate intertextuality was an issue for some students. Fig. 3 is a histogram depicting the amounts of matched text (i.e, text strings that had exact or almost exact matches in other source texts) in the research proposals as identified using TSRs divided into $5 \%$ groupings ( $_ { ( 0 - 5 \% ) }$ $5 \mathrm { - } 1 0 \%$ $1 0 { - } 1 5 \%$ etc.; $\mathbf { X }$ axis) and the number of students (y-axis) that fll into those groupings for academic year (AY)2013. The EAP course at this point in time was focused on developing academic language, such as academic vocabulary and advanced grammar constructions, and did not include any material on source-use or plagiarism avoidance.

Focusing on the first two groupings ( $0 { - } 5 \%$ and $5 { - } 1 0 \%$ , we can see that $4 6 . 9 9 \%$ of students (39 students) produced proposals with very little matching text. The more worrying results were those where matching text accounted for more than $2 5 \%$ of the proposals, with the highest such case being $6 6 \%$ In total, $2 2 . 8 9 \%$ of students (19 students) were producing texts with more than $2 5 \%$ matching text, and it was this figure that was most worrisome for the faculty and provided the impetus for the inclusion of information about plagiarism in the EAP course. Closer inspection of each proposal confirmed that large sections f text, ften including any citations in those sections, had been copied and pasted from other sources without any indication to the reader of the original source It is important to note again that these percentages were for a two- to three-page document, which also contained a short reference section that was not included in the text analyzed by the TSR. Therefore, $2 5 \%$ of the text might have been a single paragraph. The highest case, $6 6 \%$ constituted one page of text If such high percentages were being produced for full-length theses, they would indeed be problematic; however, for the research proposals analyzed in this AR project, they represented short passages of matching text.

# 4.1.2. Cycle 1 field notes

During consultations with the students who had produced these proposals, the most common reason given was that they were unaware that their trategy of writing was not appropriate. These students would ofen cite their previous educational experiences Where they had used similar strategies of reproducing chunks of text, sometimes without itation, and received no negative feedback. Such report from students support a view of threeachitypes of student writers i terms of adherence to transparency in source use. the ideal writer, who adheres to conventions of transparency in source use; the unintiated writer, who errs in source use because of ignorance of these conventions; and the unethical writer, who is aware of the conventions but opts to ignore them for personal benefit or convenience (these architypes were problematized by Howard, 1995).

# 4.1.3.  Cycle 1 literature review

A review of literature on the topic suggested that ignorance of academic conventions regarding appropriate intertextualit can indeed be a source of llegitimate intertextualit. There may be an assumption that students learn how to work with sources through prolonged exposure to example texts during their reading (Nesi & Gardner, 2012), and often no direct guidance in how to integrate source material into a student's own text isoffered by professors or supervisors (Harwood & Petric, 2012; Jamieson, 2013). If lttle or no direct fback s provided onthe suces ofthetdents eforts twork wth soures, the could be eft th the conusint l is well (Pecoari, 2006), when, as Fig. 3 suggests, this is sometimes not the case. When students attempt to infer how tocite well from published papers, they are being exposed to the end product but not the proces required to produce that end product (Pecorari, 2008). This gap in knowledge about source use can be exacerbated by educational backgrounds that approach source use differently to a receiving instittion, grduate chools overseas r provide few opportunities to practice it uch an isue is especiall petinent in contexts with many international students of various educational backgrounds. Although the impact of cultural background has been downplayed by some authors (Dong, 1996; Nguyen & Buckingham, 2019), others maintain that educational and cultural background can indeed impact students' readiness to integrate source material into their own texts according to the conventions of their discipline or local academic community (Abasi et l., 2006; Abasi & Graves, 2008; Hyland, 2009; Liu & Du, 2018). In addition, drawing students attention to plagiarism policies and indicating that the universty and faculty take such matters seriously has been shown to have a positive impact on student behavior (Brown & Howell, 001). Common approaches to dealing with the three architypes usually consist of proviing dfitions of plagarism andth teching of discetwriting sills that stdnts wllne n ordr  inrt ther source texts into their own writing such as paraphrasing and summarizing techniques (Babalola, 2012). Given the diverse backgrounds of the student body and the clear problems with illgitimate intertextualit, as well as the professed ignorance of the expectations of transparent source use by the students, it was decided that information about plagiarism should be included in a course created to support students in their writing.

# 4.2. Cycle 1 general plan and action steps

After this reconnaissance phase, materials were added to the EAP course to raise awareness among the students of the ssue of plagiarism. Four lessons were dedicated to this purpose in the fifteen-lesson course. Wees 9, 10, and 11 were dedicated to intertextuality. In Week 9, classroom discussions were held on defining plagiarism In addition, examples of the kinds of information that need to be cited were discussed, and instruction was provided on formatting in-text citations following American Psychological As. sociation (APA) conventions. In Weeks 10-12, students were given practice activities in discrete writing skill such as the use of reporting verbs, paraphrasing, and summarizing.

# 4.3. Cycle 1 monitor effects

Looking at the data for AY2017 and AY2018 for those students who were enrolled in the EAP course (Fig. 4), we can see that ittle progress was made in reducing worrsome matching text. The percentage of students in AY2017 who submitted proposals with matching text above $2 5 \%$ was $2 5 . 4 2 \%$ (15 students). In 2018, $1 6 . 3 9 \%$ of students (10 students) submitted proposals with over $2 5 \%$ matching text. While there was evidence of a drop in the number of proposals with higher than $2 5 \%$ matching text, the number of students in this category was still high.

Closer inspection of these TSRs indicated clear problems with intertextuality. For example, the proposal with the highest per. centage of matching text in 2017 $( 5 2 \% )$ had large sections of text copied and pasted from sources, with no indication of quotation; however, this student had also dutifully included citations to the sources that the text had been taken from. The second highet percentage that year $( 4 6 \% )$ , on the other hand, had copied and pasted three paragraphs from a source, including the original in-text citations in that source, and had not cited that source anywhere in the paper. The 2018 data followed a similar pattern.

If we compare the results for the AY2017 and AY2018 EAP cohorts with the results for non-EAP students from the same years (ig. 5), we can see that taking the course sems to have had litl mpact on the prealence of matching tex in ther proposals. That is, the non-EAP students submitted texts with matching-text profiles that were closer to the behavior we would like to see the low matching-text percentages typical of full participants in the academic CoP.

These results suggested two conclusions: a) there may have been a ink between English proficiency and the amount of matching text (as non-EAP students were deemed to be proficient enough to handle their graduate studies without the support of EAP), and b) the

EAP course was not achieving one of its main mandates. Table 2 compares all groups: the ${ < } 1 0 \%$ group--the size of which we would have liked to see increase, was only increasing for non-EAP students--and the ${ > } 2 5 \%$ group--which we would have liked to see decrease in size--was also decreasing for non-EAP students, with a modest decrease in 2018 for EAP students.

# 4.4. Cycle 1-2 reconnaissance: explain any failure

The data seemed to clearly indicate that the EAP course was having little impact on the llgitimate intertextual practice of some of the student body. To understand why this was, I turned to consultations with and feedback from the students. These sessions always seemed to revolve around the same two topics.

. Do I need to cite this idea? . How many words can I copy from the source text?

It is perhaps not surprising that a course that focused on a) the definition of plagiarism as what has to be cited and b) strategies for changing enough of the original language from a source text to constitute paraphrasing resulted in such questions. What also became apparent through these consultations was that many of the students saw integrating sources into their writing as a bothersome task. fraught with dangers that they did not fully understand.

# 4.4.1. Cycle 1-2 self-reflection

Turning t self-refletion I te to understand how my aproach  integrating soures differed from that f my stdents.  began to understand that I had a istinctlydifferent pproach o intrating sources intomy own writing than my students. do not ask, doI have to cite his de Instd, I ask, isthis a goo plc for  citation? Cn I show the reader here my claims come from y suppying heevidence that led me to make those claims in the first place? My approach to integrating sources was more strategic, designed to support my arguments and connect my research with the other research in my field. The questions for the second cycle of the AR project were . How do members of an academic CoP view the sources they cite? . Would teaching students to view sources in the same way help them to overcome their ilegitimate intertextuality issues

# 4.4.2. Cycle 1-2 literature review

Citation is a defining characteristic of scholarly writing (Hyland, 1999, 2009). As a result, a number of atempts have been made to explore the ofen-occluded processes (Pecorari, 2006) involved in citing the works of other authors. In Table 3, Harwood's (2009) 11-item typology is outlined, with other typologies of the rhetorical purposes of citations in student papers presented for comparison (Petric, 2007; Wette, 2017) this comparison is, by necessit, rather rough as there i hardly a one-toone correspondence among the categories in the three typologies. Focusing firs on Harwood's typology, reearcher could include a citation in their text for multiple, complex reasons, and often a single citation would be included for multiple reasons. In addition to the expected reasons such as supporting the researcher's claims and giving credit for the source of an idea, there are other functions that indicate the social dimensions of citations in the academic CoP such as advertising one's own work or the work of colleagues, tying oneself to a subgroup of researchers in the field, and citations to future work.

These functions do not appear in the typologies created for student writing (Petric's and Wett's typologies), perhaps indicating that students are not participating in an academic CoP to the same extent as the more established members and that thir reliance on the more direct rhetorical and plagiarism-avoidance uses of citation indicates that they are still larning the ropes, as it were.

5. Cycle 2 2019/2020 - reconnaissance: fact finding & analysis

# 5.1. Cycle 2 amended plan and action steps

During Ay2018, I created and piloted some materials designed to encourage students to explore how academic sources were used in the academic community. This involved exploring the various motivations for including citationsfollowing Harwood's (2009) typology-- including disciplinary variation, and the differing opinions within academic communities about the legitimacy of reproducing text strings of various lengths (Davis & Morley, 2015).

The activities that were used to raise student awareness of the role of citations in academic writing included the following.

: Discussing Harwood's (2009) typology of citations   
: Speculating on the purpose of citations in authentic texts from their discipline   
: Discussing where citations would be required, desirable, or inappropriate in a text that has had all citations removed   
Evaluating (fabricated) student texts for transparency of source use with reference to the original source, especialy in terms of reproduced text and secondhand citation   
Exploring the diffrences between integral and non-integral citations, and the motivations for choosing one form over another

Throughout these activities, it was made clear to the students that often there was no right answer as to whether citation should be included and that citation decisions were occasionally made based on personal preferences as well s other factors such as disciplinary difference. This dialogic (Bakhtin, 1981;Lyle, 2008) and critical pproach to citation patterns and conventions was demed important to encourage students to engage with this fundamental illar of academic discourse (Du, 202) and encourage them to participate in that discourse as members (albeit not yet full members) engaged in legitimate peripheral participation (Lave & Wenger, 1991).

# 5.2. Cycle 2 monitoring effects

Fig. 6 shows the TSRs for AY2019 and AY2020. Comparison of the data for both academic years was somewhat complicated by the much larger sample for AY2020 (see the note in Table 4). Notably, in AY2019, the extreme cases with matching text over $4 0 \%$ disappeared, with only one case in AY2020.

Table 4 presents a comparison of the data for Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 of the AR project. In 2019, for the first time, the percentage of students producing proposals with less than $1 0 \%$ matching text was comparable with the higher proficiency group of non-EAP students, and those students with over $2 5 \%$ percent matching text in EAP was less than that of the non-EAP group. In AY2020, the percentage of students with matching text over $2 5 \%$ declined to $5 . 9 3 \%$ , which was approximately a quarter of the baseline year or the AY2017 EAP cohort. It seemed, therefore, that the new iteration of the course may have been at least partly responsible for the institution moving closer to its goal of reducing illegitimate intertextuality.

# 6. Cycle 2/3 reconnaissance: explain any failure

While there certainly semed to have been some progressin tackling llegitimate intertextuality in the universt, there was clearly still work to be done. One group of students that has not ben mentioned thus far are those students who were between the extremes on the matching-text spectrum, producing texts between $1 0 \%$ and $2 5 \%$ . Table 4 also shows the percentage of students who fell into this category each year, and as can be seen, the figure usually ranged between $3 0 \%$ and $4 5 \%$ $m = 3 5 . 6 3 \%$ $S D = 7 . 5 3 \%$

Visual inspection of the TSRs for the proposals produced by these students revealed a mixed group of writers. At the lower end of the range, matching-text percentages might have been driven up by the reproduction of text that was dificult or unnecessary to paraphrase such as list or standard variable descriptions. Another aspect of TSRs is that many four- or five-word terms are highlighted by the software. One example from the corpus in 2020 was the term the National Medium-Term Development Plan. While such six-word strings alone are unlikely to considerably push up matching-text percentages, enough of these small matches could do so.

However, for other students in this $1 0 \%$ to- $2 5 \%$ category, the matching-text percentage had been driven up by their efforts to integrate text from a source text into ther own tex i one of two ways: quotation or patchwritig. The number f students who fell into this middle category can be greatly impacted by whether or not quotes were counted as matching text in the TSRs, as quotation seemed to be a popular intertextual strategy among the student writers in this sample. Patchwriting, the proces of copying and pasting text from a source into your own text and then changing one or two words in a poorattempt at paraphrasing (Howard, 1995), can also push up matching-text percentages as the Turnitin.com software seems to be very adept at spotting this kind of inertextuality. It was a positive sign that students knew that if they intended to use the same words as the original author, they needed to put those words betwen quotation marks, or failing that, they needed to paraphrase it; however, an over-reliance on quoting or engaging in patchwriting is not the ultimate target-behavior.

# 6.1. Cycle 2/3 self-reflection

I tried to understand why my students sruggled with over-quoting and patchwriting and why this was not an issue for me. One obvious reason was that most of my students were writing in a second language and using the exact word or a slightly modified version of them might have been easier for them than creating entirely new sentences. After consultations with some students, the reason seemed to be related to a reluctance to change the original tex for fear of changing the original meaning or a belief that changing the original text was unnecessary. My conclusion was that I seldom tried to transport a sentence from a source text into my own text. Instead, I often wrote a synthesis of the ideas expressed in a number of texts. Could this over-reliance on quotation and tendency to patch-write have been a result of over-reliance on a single text for information and a failure to synthesize the literature?

# 6.2. Cycle 2/3 literature review

Quotation can be a useful tol for L2 writers for a number of reasons. For writers who lack confidence in their ability to produce an original retlling (araphrasing) or summary of the deas in the source text accurately, quotation can be safer method for integrating the words of others into their own texts (Hirvela & Du, 2013; Nguyen & Buckingham, 2019; Zhang & Hyland, 2021). Wette and Furneau (2018) noted that some Brazilian students in thir tudy avoided paraphrasing and summary in favor of quoting because "in Brazil we did a lot of big quotes, as a way of acknowledging the style of the person who first thought of the idea" (p. 191) Similarly, Zotzmann and Sheldrake (2021) noted that L2 writers had higher than L1 writers) agreement with statements such as "The key to successful writing is accuratel reporting what authorities think' and Good writers include a lot of quotes from authorities in their

writing'" (p. 10).

This relationship with uthorities can also explain why some students shy away from synthesizing (see examples and discussion in Doolan, 2021; Hyland, 2009; Zhang & Hyland, 2021). As Abasi et al's (2006) student writer, Parvin, explained, she was incapable of arranging the source material into a coherent argument and instead presented the ideas of these authorities as they were, without engagement or synthesis. She summed i up as I can say I wrote almost nothing myself (p. 112). It is not surprising that attempts to reproduce an idea from a source text in one's own text, in an L2, without any significant changes to the meaning would be extremely challnging. One way to sidestep this challenge would be to quote the original or alter it as litle as possble using a patchwriting strategy. However, the ultimate target behavior for neophytes -which would vary depending on discipline-- would be for the student writersto tel a research story (Feak & Swale, 2009), where they present the pertinent information in their own words, complete with evaluation of the evidence where appropriate, and supported with reference to the sources. The question for the third cycle was as follows:

Would teaching students how to synthesize texts reduce the amount of quoted, patch-written, and copied text that they produce!

# 7. Cycle 3 2021 reconnaissance: fact finding & analysis

# 7.1. Cycle 3 action steps

The syllabus for the EAP course remained unchanged in AY2021, and the TSRs for the proposal activity were consistent with the AY2019 and AY2020 numbers. One change that was made for my section of the course was achange in the final writing activity, which became a complex task involving the reading of abstracts from (fabricated) journal atice that provided equivocal evidence on a topic that the students had to write about. The task was also given as a take-home assgnment so that time constraints did not impact the students' ability to complete the task Prior to setting the task, a classroom activity was used to explore what was meant by synthesis and what kind of synthesis writing might be expected of them as graduate students (see Appendix B).

# 8. Cycle 3 monitoring effects

Synthesis is not something that can be easily measured using similarity reports alone, and so the effects of this adaptation to the course were observed through an analysis of the texts submitted for the final writing actvity by the students. This analysis involved a holistic evaluation of the degre to which the students were synthesizing the source material. Factors that were considered when evaluating the success of the synthesis are explained in Table 5.

Table 5 Descriptors for the holistic analysis of synthesis in the writing task.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Score</td><td>Descriptors</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>: Organization: The writer has organized the information by topic rather than by author. Argument and Suport: The writer has expained what is known in the itrature on a topic, supporting this explanation with citations where</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">2</td><td>appropriate.</td></tr><tr><td>Writer&#x27;s ce het i cely th wites wn exly nrrie of th to thr hanork  constive sariefth sources : Organization: The writer has organized the information by topic rather than author.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">1</td><td>Argumet and port/iters ce: The text is may constive on-o to-line saries f rah wth n sese f th witer taking corl of the narrative.</td></tr><tr><td>. Organization: The writer has organized the information by author. : Argument and Support: The writer has summarized each source in turn.</td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 6 shows the results of this analysis, ordered from the lowest synthesis score (top of the table) to the highest synthesis core (bottom of the table). As the sample was small, with only 16 participants, al conclusions based on these data must be measured. Only two students received a score of 1 for synthesis, and each had a very diffrent profile. One received the highest matching-text percentage of the entire sample and was one of only two students to enter the ${ > } 2 5 \%$ matching-text category, if quoted material was counted as matching text. The other had a score of $7 \%$ (or $9 \%$ counting quoted material). Those who received a score of 2 for synthesizing had $7 - 1 2 \%$ matching text on average, with one exception $( 1 7 \% )$ . This group, however, seemed to be the most impacted when quotes were included.

Ten students received a score of 3 for synthesizing. This group was rather mixed, but six of the 10 students had low matching-text scores. The other four, however, had some of the highest matching-tex cores of the sample. To sum up, it would be diffcult t say that the ability to synthesize texts precudes tendency to reuse tex from source texts based on this small sample. There is someevidence that those who synthesized the sources tended to have lower matching-text scores, but there is also enough counterevidence in this small sample to cast doubt on that finding.

# 8.1. Quality as experienced

A survey was conducted with students from the AY2021 iteration of the course. This survey asked about the students previous education in source-useand plagiarism avoidance, if their experiences in EAP had changed how they approached using sources in their writing, and the degree to which they felt they were a member of the research community.

8.1.1. Previous source use and plagiarism education and the impact of the EAP course Most respondents stated that they had had some instruction on source use and plagiarism during their undergraduate studies, but they recognized a difference in the level of detail and clarity of the instruction. As one respondent mentioned,

"I had the same class when I did a bachelor's degree in my home country [..]. However, most of the information was forgotten, and the content of the information was also not so clear and deep."

This sense of clarity and deeper understanding was supported by responses to a question that asked how their use of source material had changed after the course. Some pointed out new revelations about reproducing text, for example,

"Yes, it changed completely. Previously I would not consider patchwriting as a plagiarism but apparently it is."

And others mentioned having a deeper understanding of the role of citation in academic discourse,

"Yes, the EAP cours assted me in revealing new perspectives about writing academic papers in a more professional way, specifically through understanding citing reasons and techniques."

# 8.2. Membership in an academic CoP

The final section of the survey asked the students if they felt that they were members of a research community. Although this question might be difficult to answer for some students, it was included in the survey for comparison purposes as one of the frst questions that students were asked in my section of the course was if they considered themselves to be researchers or on a trajectory towards being a researcher, even if only temporaril. This question was designed to encourage discussion of thir role as master's students and their roles in an academic CoP, so the students were likely to have understood the question and, during the EAP course, had time to consider and discuss their opinion on this topic before the survey was conducted. When the question had firt been asked at the start of the Fallterm (the beginning of the academic year), of the 17 students in the clas, only two had claimed tobe members of the research community. In the survey at the end of the academic year, that number increased to seven (of the 11 students that responded to the survey).

Based on the responses provided in the survey, it appeared that the students recognized that their understanding of intertextuality had improved through the course and that some of them felt that they were capable of participating in an academic CoP.

# 9. Discussion and conclusion

This paper has reported on a five-year AR project that sought to reduce illeitimate intertextuality in graduate student writing Traditional approaches based on definitions of plagiarism and the teaching of discrete writig sills such as paraphrasing and summarizing had some effect on reducing the instance of illegitimate intertextuality in student writing, but the problem persisted.

During the second cycle of the AR project, a number of leaning activities were introduced that were designed to facilitate the socializing of the students into n academic CoP. Tradtional eucation on source use, such as that in the first cycle of this project, often fail to socialize students into an academic CoP (Casanave, 2002; Friedman, 2019). Therefore, it was hypothesized that students had a different approacho intertextualit than full member f socil sciences academic CoP, reulting in source us that did not lign with community conventions for intertextuality. Based on the monitoring ofeffects from thi second cycle n improvement in source use (i. e., a reduction in illitimate intertextuality) was noted. These reuls support Abasi e al.'s (2006) argument that plagirism in student texts may be an issue of authorial identity construction.

Finally, in the third cycle of the AR project, I tested a hypothesis that one reason for reproducing text from sources could have been an inability tosynthesis source material (Abasi et al., 2006). If students preferred to summarize their sources, it would be likely that those summaries would reuse some of the original source language. The results of this third cycle were mixed. Some students did produce synthesized texts that had very littl or no reproduced tex from the sources; however, other students produced synthesized texts that sill contained high percentages of copied language from the sources. This cycle had a smallr sample of 16, and so further research is needed to explore any link between synthesizing and ilegitimate intertxtuality. Such research would require the use of a writing task that provides the sources to e synthesized so that ratr couldeffetively ealuate how the writers a using those sources. It would also be important to develop a more precise measure of synthesis than was used in this AR project. Finally, more controlled studies that have pre- and post-instructionassesment are required to support any cause and effct clams about reduced intertextuality resulting from the instructional interventions presented in this AR report.

The institution in question has succeeded in its goals to reduce the instances of extreme intertextuality (operationalized here as texts with above $4 0 \%$ matching text) among its students. It cannot be said that allstudents were achieving the kinds of legitimate intertextuality that was expected of them by their professors and advisors, but the situation has improved, and this improvement was likely partly due to a change in how students understand the role of source material in their texs and a growing sense of participation in an academic community of practice for some.

Phenomena such as illgitimate intertxtuality are often occluded and dificult to investigate directly. The causes of, and moti. vations behind instances of this form of intertextuality in student (and non-student) writing can be dificult to investgate because the consequences for such writing practices can be dire. As a result, honest reporting from those found to have engaged in them can be difficult to secure. AR provides a trial-and-error approach to exploring phenomena that can only be indirectly investigated. Through dialogue and experimentation with successve cohorts of graduate students, I was able to understand some of the numerous dimensions of this complex antisocial behavior among neophytes in an academic CoP to a far greater extent than would have been possble in a single study.

Looking forward, with the increasing presence of AI capable of synthesizing information across numerous sources and generating entire texts at th ush f to i is beoming incrsinglyfficlt for witing instucortoundrstand hw he texts submitted by their students were produced (Storey, 2023). One implication of this study is that illgitimate intertextuality may be a result of differing understandings of and approaches to using sources between student writers and more established members of an academic CoP. The results of this project also suggest that when students are socialized into such an academic CoP, their writing practices may align more with community conventions. It may also be the case that inapproriate use of Al is asymptom of a different approach to writing on the part of a student writer compared to that of an academic CoP, which begs the question, what isappropriate use of AI? This study has relied on a body of literature that explored and explained source-use conventions in an academic CoP; as of yet, no such body of literature exis for Al use. uture reearch will need to establish communty onventions in thi rard if students are expected to align with those expectations.

# Appendix B

Synthesis Task The activity took about 60 minutes of class time and required some homework writing. It progresed as follows

Students are given three short abstracts. Each abstract contains some information on two topics: the progresstoward equality in pay (gender wage gap) and the progress toward equal female representation in senior positions.   
Each abstract reports on a study with important difference for interpretation of the reults: public versus private sector, developing versus developed countries, and quantitative large-sample studies versus qualitative small-sample studies.   
: No two abstracts have the same conclusions, but there are areas of agreement.   
Students are given 30 minutes to read and synthesize the texts in a literature-review style text, where they are to report what is known about the two topics.   
. Responses are not collected at this point.   
After the students have finished their responses, four sample responses are distributed to the students. These responses are presented as sample student responses (Students 1-4) but were actually written by the instructor.   
: The four responses are as follows: Student $1 = \mathtt { n o }$ synthesis: the student summarizes the sources one by one, concluding with a sentence that states that there are mixed results; Student $2 =$ some attempt at synthesis: the students organizes the information by topic, but each paragraph contains a topic sentence claiming the evidence is mixed and a one- or two-line summary of the sources one by one; Student $3 = { \mathfrak { n } } 0$ synthesis/misrepresentation of the sources: the student makes an argument that is unrelated to the sources yet uses the sources to defend that position, and Student 4: well-wrien synthesis thestudent explains what is known about the topics in two paragraphs, attempting to reconcile equivocal evidence by reference to differences in study design and context. The student explains in their own words with citations where appropriate.   
The students are given time to discuss each of the student responses and to comment on the strong and weak points of each.   
Most students recognize that Student 4 has provided the best version; however, some students do question if the student has gone too far beyond the sources.   
Based on their reading and evaluation of the sample student responses, the students are asked to reevaluate their own responses written at the start f the activit f they fee it is nsay, they are ask  t th tex for omework and sumit it If th feel their original text is an adequate synthesis, they can submit it immediately.   
: All submissions are evaluated for synthesis and source use by the instructor.
