# ABSTRACT

The cultivation of critical thinking with the assistance of Information Communication Technology (ICT) tools has drawn much attention from researchers and practitioners in the field of Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL). With the purpose of exploring whether the application could help improve students’ critical thinking and ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) skills and how ICT tools are applied in TESOL to cultivate critical thinking, a systematic review was conducted and a total of 22 eligible studies were analyzed. The results show that: (1) students’ critical thinking and ESOL skills have demonstrated improvement in the studies applying ICT tools to TESOL; (2) the ICT application is unbalanced across different ESOL skills and various types of ICT tools have been used in different ways to promote students’ critical thinking.

Critical thinking is a higher-order thinking skill that enables people to think reasonably and reflectively (Ennis, 1985; Glaser, 1985). One of the important aims of education is to develop independent thinkers with the ability of using cognitive skills and strategies to become problem solvers (McGregor, 2007). In the field of language teaching, critical thinking cultivation has been considered very important for language learners (Brown, 2004; Davidson, 1998). Critical thinking elements such as explanation, analysis, evaluation, and interpretation are important for language communication (Kennedy et  al., 1991). For example, when choosing an appropriate way of expression for a certain context, students need to analyze the pragmatic context, compare the potential choices and make inferences to decide on the choice. Furthermore, enhancing students’ critical thinking in language classrooms could also help learners monitor their own ways of language learning and thus make the language more meaningful for them (Shirkhani & Fahim, 2011).

In recent years, studies have been conducted on the cultivation of critical thinking with ICT tools in TESOL (see, e.g. Chien et  al., 2019; Daud & Husin, 2004; Eftekhari et  al., 2016; Lin et  al., 2016; Yang & Wu, 2012; Zou & Xie, 2018). What is the current situation of ICT application in TESOL? What ICT tools have been used in the instruction of different ESOL skills? Have students’ critical thinking and ESOL skills showed improvement through TESOL with ICT application? How have ICT tools been used in cultivating critical thinking? These are the questions worth exploring from the existing studies to provide reference and guidance to future ICT application in TESOL.

# Defining critical thinking

The definition of critical thinking has been widely discussed. According to Norris and Ennis (1989), critical thinking is ‘reasonable and reflective thinking that focuses upon what to believe or do’ (Norris & Ennis, 1989, p.1). Paul and his colleagues considered critical thinking as ‘disciplined, self-directed thinking which exemplifies the perception of thinking appropriate to a particular mode or domain of thinking–about any subject, content or problem in which the thinker improves the quality of his or her thinking by skillfully taking charge of the structures inherent in thinking and imposing intellectual standards upon them’ (Paul et al., 1993, p. 4). Facione and Facione (1997) defined critical thinking as higher-order reasoning used in reaching professionally informed judgments in high-stakes, time- constrained, and many times novel problem situations. Fisher (2001) described critical thinking as an active process whereby one thinks independently, raising questions while persisting in the use of relevant information to skillfully reason to logical conclusions. Despite the different focuses of the definitions, the scholars all tend to view critical thinking as the key to solving novel problems or making reasonable judgments.

# Critical thinking cultivation in TESOL

Many studies have been done to explore the ways to cultivate students’ critical thinking in the instruction of different ESOL skills, especially reading and writing.

Some studies focused on the application of an existing teaching approach to cultivate critical thinking in TESOL. For example, one study, conducted to examine the effect of debate-based instruction in an ESOL reading course on students’ reading comprehension and critical thinking skills in Iran (Tous et  al., 2015), suggests that debate has a significant impact on students’ reading comprehension ability and critical thinking ability. In another Iranian study, Bashiri and Shahrokhi (2016) explored the effect of a process-based approach on students’ critical thinking abilities, ESOL writing skills, and learning autonomy, and found positive effects of the process-based approach on students’ ESOL writing skills and thinking abilities.

Some studies designed instructional patterns to cultivate students’ critical thinking in TESOL. For example, Gao and her colleagues (Gao et  al., 2017) employed a teaching method of three reading phases (Phase one: from schemata activating to predicting; Phase two: from reading to mapping; Phase three: from questioning to evaluating) to promote critical thinking in an Academic English Reading course. The results of the study showed that the method significantly improved students’ critical thinking and reading skills. In another study, Lu and Xie (2019) examined the effects of a critical thinking-embedded instructional pattern in a tertiary ESOL argumentative writing course in China. The data collected from the critical thinking test and the writing test showed that students in the experimental group outperformed the control group in terms of critical thinking skills and ESOL writing ability.

# Defining and classifying ICT tools

ICT generally refers to technologies that provide access to information through telecommunications (ICT, 2019). In this research, ICT refers to the broad uses of technology in schools (Cohen et  al., 1996).

ICT tools can be classified into four categories: informative tools, situating tools, constructive tools, and communicative tools (Chen et al., 2000). Lim and Tay (2003) provided further explanation of the four categories:

‘Informative tools are applications that provide vast amounts of information in various formats such as text, sound, graphics or video… Situating tools are systems that situate students in an environment where they may ‘experience’ the context and happenings…. Constructive tools are general-purpose tools that can be used for manipulating information, constructing one’s own knowledge, or visualizing one’s understanding…. Communicative tools are systems that mediate communication between the teacher and students or among students beyond the physical barrier (either by space, time or both) of the classroom.’ (p. 427)

This classification is applied in the current study and the reasons are multi-fold. First, it focuses on different mediating roles played by ICT tools in the instructional process (Lim & Tay, 2003). Second, the four types of ICT tools have been found to be able to engage students in a higher-order thinking process (see, e.g. Kearney & Treagust, 2001; Lapadat, 2000; Neo & Neo, 2001; Oliver & Hannafin, 2000). Third, this classification has been widely used to facilitate the analysis of ICT use in studies of various disciplines including TESOL (see, e.g. Lim & Tay, 2003; Pratama et  al., 2020; Sadik, 2008).

# The application of ICT tools in TESOL

It is believed that ICT tools have the potential to extend learning beyond the physical classroom and contribute to educational development and effective learning (Ibrahim, 2010; Yunus et  al., 2013). With the development of ICT, its pedagogical benefits for language instruction have been extensively explored. ICT tools such as Facebook, forums, blogs, and Wiki have been applied in TESOL to improve students’ ESOL skills (see, e.g. Binti Shukor & Noordin, 2014; Chen et  al., 2015; Hung, 2015; Hwang et  al., 2014; Kessler & Bikowski, 2010; Miyazoe & Anderson, 2010; Shih, 2011; Shintani, 2016). With the purpose of examining the possible impacts of flipping the classroom on ESOL learners’ academic performance, learning attitudes, and participation levels, Hung (2015) applied WebQuest to a flipped English classroom. The results showed that students’ general English abilities (vocabulary, listening, speaking, and writing) from the Flipped group and Semi-flipped groups outperformed those from the Non-flipped group. Shih (2011) conducted a study to investigate the effects of integrating Facebook and peer assessment in ESOL writing classes. Data gained from writing tests, questionnaire, and interview revealed that students’ ESOL writing skills, interest, and motivation were improved through Facebook integrated instruction.

# Research questions

The cultivation of critical thinking has become an important aim in TESOL and ICT tools are increasingly used in English teaching. A systematic review analyzing the current situation, the outcomes, and ways of ICT application to promote critical thinking in TESOL will provide insights and reference for researchers and practitioners in the field of computer assisted language learning. Therefore, the following research questions were sought:

1. Can ICT application in TESOL contribute to the development of students’ critical thinking and ESOL skills?   
2. How are ICT tools applied to TESOL to promote students’ critical thinking?

# Method

# Literature search

To answer these research questions, the following searching strategies were adopted. The literature search was mainly conducted in the database of Web of Science (WOS), which includes major peer-reviewed journals of social science, covering a large number of education-related studies. Scopus was also used to supplement the data. Our target articles include studies published from 1990 to December 2020, and the final retrieval time is August 31, 2021. The time range was chosen because few studies related to critical thinking or educational technology appeared before 1990. As ICT tools may display themselves in different forms, we did not use ICT-related terms as the search words. We used the search sentence (‘critical thinking’ and (language or read or reading or write or writing or listen or listening or oral or speak or speaking or English)) to search articles in WOS and Scopus, which yields 1069 and 2361 hits, respectively. After the initial search, we also conducted the search in WOS centering on ‘critical thinking’ in three major categories of journals related to educational technology, language teaching, and thinking skills, which adds another 235 articles. The total number of articles is 3665.

# Inclusion criteria

The articles collected in this systematic review must comply with the following criteria:

1. The studies must involve some form of ICT.   
2. The studies must address students’ critical thinking.   
3. Participants in the studies should be ESOL learners.   
4. The studies must be empirical.

# Screening procedure

The two researchers of the current study screened the articles with the criteria mentioned above. To ensure the inter-rater reliability, Cohen’s Kappa coefficient value was examined. The value was found to be 0.75, which suggests the degree of agreement between researchers (Viera & Garrett, 2005). The screening procedure is shown in Figure 1.

Our literature search method yields a wide range of studies since we did not limit the search with ICT-related keywords such as ‘e-learning’ or ‘blended learning’. This enabled us to include all the potential studies, because ICT tools may present themselves in various forms in the studies. Despite the large starting number of the studies, the number of the chosen studies after screening reduces dramatically. One explanation for the small number is that studies addressing both ICT application and critical thinking cultivation in TESOL setting are rather limited, even though many studies have been conducted to explore critical thinking cultivation or the application of ICT tools in TESOL. Another reason that could account for the small number of studies is the research questions of this study. This study aims to explore whether and how ICT tools are applied to promote critical thinking in the instruction of ESOL skills and what the possible contributions of the application are, only a small number (22) of studies were left after implementing the screening procedure with the rigid inclusion criteria.

# Results

# Overview of the studies

We first examined the context of the studies applying ICT tools to promote critical thinking in TESOL. Specifically, we focused on the numbers of the studies over the years, the education contexts of the participants, the countries and regions where the studies were conducted, and the operationalization of the concept of critical thinking.

# The numbers of the studies over the years

Figure 2 shows the distribution of the studies that applied ICT tools to promote critical thinking in TESOL by period. In order to better present the trend, we chose three years as a time span to count the number of articles. The first research into the area was published in the period of 2000 to 2002, followed by a small number of studies in the next decade also. There was a remarkable increase in the number of articles $\left( \mathtt { n } = 6 \right)$ in the period of 2012–2014. The number of studies remained steady in the following years till December 2020.

# Education contexts of the participants in the studies

As is shown in Figure 3, $6 6 \%$ of the studies were conducted in a university setting, followed by high schools at1 $9 \%$ . Schools of other educational contexts witnessed fewer studies in the field.

# Distribution of studies by countries and regions

In terms of the country and region distribution, this review suggests that the studies of the ICT use in TESOL to promote critical thinking

occurred in a wide range of countries and regions. One-half of the studies were from Taiwan $\left( \mathrm { n } = 6 \right)$ and USA $\left( \mathtt { n } = 5 \right)$ (See Figure 4).

# Operationalization of critical thinking

Different theoretical frameworks were adopted in the reviewed studies to operationalize critical thinking. As shown in Table 2, the frameworks from Delphi Report and Bloom’s taxonomy were adopted most frequently. Some frameworks only appeared in one study. Some studies, however, did not provide the relevant information about their theoretical frameworks (see, e.g. Dantas-Whitney, 2002; Ebadi & Rahimi, 2018; Grami, 2012; Lee & Gilles, 2012; Nor et  al., 2011; Soufi et  al., 2015; Young, 2003; Zhang, 2018).

# Students’ improvements through TESOL with ICT application

# Methods and measurements used to evaluate critical thinking

In the studies, the development of critical thinking in TESOL was explored with different methods and measurements (See Table 3). Some studies adopted the quasi-experimental method which involves a comparison group and an experimental group. Some studies administered pretest and posttest to only one group of students to examine students’ critical thinking improvement. In contrast to the studies with experimental design, other studies sought to explore students’ critical thinking with in-depth analysis of the cases. There are also studies using more than one measurement to triangulate the findings. For example, in the study conducted by Hobbs and his colleagues (2015), both interview and classroom observation were used to measure the improvement of critical thinking. In another study, Yang and Wu (2012) examined the effects of Digital Story Telling on critical thinking by a critical thinking test and interview.

# Improvement of critical thinking and ESOL skills

As critical thinking was operationalized under different theoretical frameworks (See Table 2), the critical thinking skills improved by ICT application were also represented by the terms from different theoretical frameworks. To present the effectiveness more clearly and consistently, we used the framework from Delphi Report to unify the terms. That is, we used the terms from Delphi Report to replace the terms from other frameworks if they denote the same meanings. We chose this framework because it is the one that could cover all the critical thinking skills mentioned in the studies. The definitions for each thinking skill under the Delphi Report Framework are shown in Table 4 (Facione, 1990).

As is shown in Table 5, the data analysis reveals the improvement of critical thinking and ESOL skills in TESOL studies with ICT application. Regarding critical thinking skills, studies applying tools of communicative function witnessed the improvement in most critical thinking skills, followed by tools with constructive function. Relatively fewer thinking skills were improved in the studies applying informative and situating tools. As for ESOL skills, studies applying informative, constructive and communicative tools revealed students’ improvement on writing and general English. ESOL listening, reading, and speaking skills were found to have been promoted in the studies applying situating and informative & communicative tools.

# The use of ICT tools to promote critical thinking

# ICT tools applied

According to the findings of this study, altogether thirteen tools were found in the extracted studies and they were applied to promote critical thinking in the instruction of different ESOL skills (See Figure 5), and some studies applied more than one ICT tool. Learning Management System (LMS) (e.g. Moodle), blog, and video were used most often and were applied in the instruction of more than one language skill to promote critical thinking. The majority of the tools, on the other hand, catered only for the instruction of one skill. Specifically, Wiki and email were only used in teaching writing; Chat tools, Virtual Reality (VR), and problem-solving applications only appeared in the teaching of speaking; the exclusive tools for teaching reading were annotation and note-taking tools, and corpus. Regarding the frequency of ICT application in the instruction of different ESOL skills, as is shown in Figure 5, the ICT tools were used most frequently in the instruction of writing, followed by speaking and reading, and least used in listening and general English proficiency.

# The use of ICT tools

It can be seen from Table 6 that tools with communicative function were used most widely and they were mainly used to support synchronous and asynchronous communication. For example, Grami (2012) used blogs to construct an interactive online learning environment in an ESOL writing class for students to conduct asynchronous communication. Young (2003) used chatroom to facilitate students’ synchronous communication in an

ESOL course. Tools with constructive function were also applied quite widely. They were used for searching information in English and creating and collecting notes on the reading texts. In the study conducted by Nor and her colleagues, both annotation and note-taking tools were introduced to students in reading online texts. The annotation tool helped students search and process information by inserting prompts and questions within the text; the note-taking tool allowed students to make notes and share them with their classmates (Nor et  al., 2011). Video is the only informative tool found in the reviewed studies and its function is to provide language learning materials to the learners. For example, in the study conducted by Zhang (2018), specifically designed online video resources were supplemented to the students in an English writing course. A situating tool is used in only one study in which VR was developed to situate students in Englishspeaking contexts (Chien et  al., 2019).

# Discussion

This systematic review showed a rapid increase in the number of studies that applied ICT tools to promote critical thinking in TESOL since the end of the 2000s. It is also worth pointing out though, that this analysis of the trend is based on a limited number of studies and should be treated with caution.

In the studies, university students accounted for an overwhelming majority of the sample groups, followed by high school students and other participants. This result is in line with the finding of a systematic review on the research trends and features of critical thinking studies in e-learning environments, which found critical thinking skills were mostly cultivated in higher education (Chou et al., 2018). The reason for this trend might be that students in higher education are mature enough to develop their critical thinking (Yang, 2008), and universities and colleges are considered as the best place to cultivate citizens’ thinking skills for the future society (Garrison et  al., 2001). As the significance of critical thinking cultivation in TESOL is also widely recognized by schools other than tertiary level, future studies should be conducted concerning this topic in wider contexts.

Regarding the distribution of studies by country and region, relatively more ICT tools and more ESOL skills have been addressed in the studies in Taiwan and the USA. Chou and her colleagues (2018) found the similar trend, which shows more critical thinking studies in e-learning environments have been conducted across different subject areas in Taiwan and the USA than other regions.

Despite different measurements, the findings from the studies showed the development of students’ critical thinking by using ICT tools in

TESOL. Students demonstrated development in the thinking skills such as interpretation, analysis, evaluation, explanation, inference, and self-regulation. This is consistent with the research findings yielded from studies in other disciplines (Danday & Monterola, 2019; Koh et  al., 2019; Lee et  al., 2016; Priyaadharshini & Sundaram, 2018). The findings confirm that the cultivation of critical thinking requires the flexibility of time and place to accomplish the relatively challenging tasks, and an e-learning environment could contribute to critical thinking development. Unlike a normal classroom where students feel restricted and withdrawn (Cheung et  al., 2011), the ICT tools could offer students a place where they feel authentic, free, and empowered to develop their ideas and communicate with their peers. The tools are also able to free the students from the restriction of time and space in the normal classrooms so that students can generally experience more flexibility in conducting communication ( see. e.g. Liu et  al., 2015; Young, 2003 ). Furthermore, ICT tools could help create a self-directed, scaffolded and collaborative learning environment where students can better develop their thinking skills (Anderson et  al., 2001; Mroz, 2015; Yang & Hsieh, 2015).

The findings also demonstrated the improvement in students’ ESOL skills (see, e.g. Lee, 2018; Liu et  al., 2015; Shishkovskaya & Sokolova, 2015; Yang & Wu, 2012; Zou & Xie, 2018). This result indicates that the focus on the cultivation of thinking skills does not impede the development of students’ language skills; on the contrary, it helps improve them. The above conclusion, however, should be treated with caution due to the relative short period during which the studies were carried out. Since long-term interventions are considered more effective in critical thinking cultivation (see, e.g. Abrami et al., 2015; Behar-Horenstein & Niu, 2011), studies of a longer time span are needed to further examine the impacts of ICT application.

A wide range of ICT tools was used in the reviewed studies. Most of the tools in the reviewed studies, however, were used in the teaching of only one ESOL skill. It suggests that the functions of a particular ICT tool need further utilization. Familiarizing with ICT tools requires students’ attention and cognitive engagement. Learning to use too many tools may lead to students’ physical and mental strain (Lee et  al., 2016), and thus inhibit their development in critical thinking and ESOL skills. This review also finds that ICT application in the instruction of different ESOL skills is uneven: the number of the studies and the types of the ICT tools applied in writing and reading is greater than the application in listening and general English. It is also noticeable that ICT tools are only used to present listening materials. Although the additional materials could engage the students in more active learning (Reis et  al.,

2008), how to use ICT tools to promote critical thinking development in ESOL listening instruction is worth further exploring.

ICT tools of different types (informative, constructive, situating, communicative, informative & communicative, informative, constructive & communicative) were used in different ways to promote students’ critical thinking. Specifically, the reviewed studies suggest that ICT tools are used to provide language learning materials, searching information in English, create and collect notes on the reading texts, construct ‘authentic’ context in English, post opinions and learning products, and support synchronous and asynchronous communication. This result is consistent with the uses of ICT tools in language education proposed by other researchers, which include presenting and posting students’ ideas and responding to their classmates’ ideas, allowing user communication and collaboration (Yunus et  al., 2013). The application of the ICT tools could facilitate students in perceiving information from different perspectives, exchanging ideas with the peers, making joint or independent decisions, so as to enable active and meaningful learning to occur and critical thinking to develop.

# Conclusion

# Summary of the findings

This systematic review analyzed the studies applying ICT tools to cultivate critical thinking in TESOL, which were published in academic journals from 1990 to 2020. The purposes of the review are to investigate the outcomes and the ways of ICT tools application in TESOL. The findings gained from different measurements showed the positive effects of ICT tools on critical thinking and ESOL skills. As for the application of ICT tools, we found that a variety of ICT tools have been applied in TESOL, the application is uneven across different ESOL skills, and different types of the tools serve various functions to promote students’ critical thinking.

# Implications

The findings of this study yield both research and pedagogical implications. In terms of research implications, as thinking development usually requires a long period of time, the intervention of the future studies should extend the time span, and the delayed effect could also be examined. Also, more studies are needed to explore the application of ICT tools to promote critical thinking in TESOL in secondary education contexts, where critical thinking cultivation has received increasing attention. Two pedagogical implications could be drawn from this study. First, different functions of one ICT tool should be fully utilized in the instruction of more than one English skill so that students could focus more on the thinking-cultivating tasks rather than spending a substantial amount of time familiarizing themselves with many ICT tools. Second, more efforts should be put into cultivating critical thinking with ICT tools in ESOL listening instruction. For example, some interactive social network applications which involve both listening and speaking could be adopted in the ESOL listening instruction to cultivate critical thinking.

# Limitations and future research

This review presents two limitations. One limitation is that the number of studies meeting the selection criteria is small. As this review only included the studies published in English, the exclusion of articles in other languages may have an impact on the conclusion drawn from this study. The other limitation is that this review did not address the effectiveness of ICT application with effect size, for the measurements used to examine critical thinking improvement in the reviewed studies are mostly qualitative. The lack of a report on the effectiveness of the meta-analysis method might undermine the strength of the conclusion. If more studies adopting experimental design appear in the future, a meta-analysis can be carried out to examine the effect size of ICT application on critical thinking development in TESOL.
