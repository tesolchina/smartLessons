# ABSTRACT

Previous research has documented that students’ reading comprehension performance in learning English as a foreign language (EFL) differs greatly between mobile-assisted and paper-based reading. The present study extends previous work by investigating whether reading cognitive load differs between mobile-assisted and paper-based EFL reading processes and exploring whether cognitive load mediates the relationship between reading medium and EFL reading comprehension performance. The instruments used are reading comprehension tests and questionnaire surveys administered to a sample of 191 first-year college students. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates that cognitive load is significantly greater for mobile-assisted EFL reading than for paper-based EFL reading. In addition, structural equation modeling analyses indicate that cognitive load fully mediates the relationships between medium and reading comprehension performance; these mediation effects are independent of the level of English language proficiency. These results imply that cognitive load is a pivotal factor influencing students’ reading comprehension across media. Reasons for differences in reading cognitive load and its role as a mediator are discussed. Recommendations for promoting students’ reading experience on mobile phones are provided.

# 1.  Introduction

Given the widespread utilization of mobile devices in formal and informal language learning settings (Alm & Daniel, 2019; Hubbard, 2019), the topic of mobile-assisted language learning and teaching has attracted considerable interest over the past decade (Stockwell, 2022). A growing body of empirical research has examined the potential effects of these technological advancements on students’ language learning and development (Hauck et  al., 2021). One such line of inquiry focuses on the effects of reading medium on language learners’ reading comprehension processes and outcomes by comparing readers’ text processing on mobile screens versus traditional media (e.g. Hou et  al., 2022; Yu et  al., 2022; Zou & Ou, 2020). There is evidence that reading medium is a crucial variable influencing reading comprehension performance, including reading accuracy, reading speed, metacomprehension, calibration, mental construction, and use of reading strategies (Ronconi et  al., 2022; Yu et  al., 2022; for a review, see Clinton, 2019). Moreover, cognitive load appears to play a pivotal role in affecting reading comprehension performance across different reading medium contexts (e.g. Hsu et  al., 2013; Kong et  al., 2018; Plass et  al., 2003; Zumbach & Mohraz, 2008). However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the effects of reading medium, i.e. mobile-assisted vs. paper-based, on cognitive load and reading comprehension performance simultaneously (but see BrüGgemann et  al. (2022) study for the distinction in cognitive load between paper-based and computer-based reading tests). Considering the wide application of mobile-assisted language learning in the digital intelligence era, it is necessary and worthwhile to delineate the effects of medium on cognitive load demands and reading outcomes.

We aim to contribute to the field by further testing the relationship among reading medium (mobile phones and paper), cognitive load, and reading comprehension performance. After a close review of the literature on the reading processes, during which reading cognitive load plays a pivotal role and possible reasons (e.g. metacognitive regulation, level of psychological comfort, and reading strategies use) for differences in reading performance on mobile phones versus paper, we hypothesize that reading cognitive load plays a mediating role in students’ reading comprehension performance on different reading media. In the remaining section of the introduction, we first review previous research establishing the close link between reading cognitive load and reading comprehension performance, and we then review related studies reporting reading comprehension distinctions across reading media. In addition, we elaborate on the rationale for our proposal that the effects of reading medium on reading outcomes are mediated by reading cognitive load.

# 1.1.  Cognitive load and reading comprehension performance

According to cognitive load theory, cognitive load is a multidimensional construct representing the mental effort demanded to achieve a particular level of performance on a specific task (Hart & Staveland, 1988; Paas et  al., 2003; Paas & van Merrienboer, 1994; Sweller, 2010; Sweller et  al., 2011). Cognitive load originates from the interaction among the expertise of the subject, the intrinsic nature of the task (e.g. its complexity), and the extrinsic environment under which the task is performed (Hart & Staveland, 1988; Sweller, 2010; Sweller et  al., 1998, 2011). Accordingly, three types of cognitive load have been identified—intrinsic cognitive load, extraneous cognitive load, and germane cognitive load (Sweller, 2010; Sweller et  al., 2011). Intrinsic cognitive load emerges from the intrinsic nature of the task, such as the difficulty of the learning material and complexity of the information being processed. Extraneous cognitive load is generated by the manner in which the task is performed or the circumstance under which the task is presented. Specifically, extraneous cognitive load is produced when ineffective instruction methods are used or distracting information is presented, which makes a task more complex than it needs to be. In contrast to extraneous cognitive load, germane cognitive load is beneficial for learning or task completion. Germane cognitive load is imposed by working memory resources allocated to dealing with the intrinsic cognitive load associated with the information being processed, such as building cognitive schema. To optimize learners’ performance, extraneous cognitive load should be reduced, while germane cognitive load should be encouraged (Sweller, 2010; Sweller et  al., 1998, 2011).

The multidimensional construct of cognitive load can be assessed by measuring mental demand (the amount of mental and perceptual activity required), physical demand (the amount of physical activity required), temporal demand (the time pressure perceived), performance (the quality of performance perceived), effort (the amount of mental and physical activity required to accomplish the level of performance), and frustration level (the level of stress and perceived discouragement) (Hart & Staveland, 1988). The cognitive load measured during the task represents the extent of information processing in working memory (Hart & Staveland, 1988; Paas et  al., 2003; Sweller, 2010; Sweller et  al., 1998, 2011). Information is first processed via short-term memory and then stored in long-term memory (Sweller et  al., 2011). If the cognitive load required during the task exceeds the capacity of working memory, processing becomes ineffective, and an individual’s performance is hindered (DeStefano & LeFevre, 2007; Paas et  al., 2003).

Reading comprehension is an active self-regulated meaning-construction process in which readers use world knowledge and linguistic knowledge to create their understanding (Oxford, 2017). There are two distinct processing approaches: bottom-up processing and top-down processing (Goodman, 1970). In bottom-up processing, readers first recognize linguistic signals (e.g. letters, words, phrases, and discourse markers) and use these signals to construct a coherent meaning. Top-down processing is conceptually driven; readers use their world knowledge and experience to infer meaning, decide what to remember, and move on (Goodman, 1970). More recent reading comprehension models emphasize the importance of the interactive reading approach involving a combination of bottom-up and top-down processing in understanding texts, as a reader might continually shift from one reading approach to another (Kintsch, 1998; Nuttall, 1996).

Within the framework of reading cognitive load, it has been hypothesized that to comprehend a text, readers initially recognize visual words, select relevant information, and then build meaningful representations under the constraints of limited working memory (DeStefano & LeFevre, 2007; Khalifa & Weir, 2009; Plass et  al., 2003). Specifically, reading processes become interactive when readers are forced to activate prior knowledge from long-term memory, build possible schemata, store useful information in short-term memory, and finally integrate all these resources to build a meaningful construction of the text (Khalifa & Weir, 2009; Van den Broek et  al., 2016; Zumbach & Mohraz, 2008). If readers cannot activate (or do not have) prior knowledge or a mental model from their existing knowledge structure in long-term memory, they will face difficulties in selecting information, building text coherence, and further constructing meaning (DeStefano & LeFevre, 2007; Johnson-Laird, 1990; Zumbach & Mohraz, 2008).

Previous research has established a close connection between reading cognitive load and reading comprehension performance (BrüGgemann et  al., 2022; Hsu et  al., 2013; Kong et  al., 2018; Plass et  al., 2003; Varol & Erçetin, 2021; Zumbach & Mohraz, 2008; for a review, see DeStefano & LeFevre, 2007). For instance, Plass et  al. (2003) studied the effects of annotation type, which varies in cognitive load demands, on the foreign language comprehension performance of students with low and high verbal and spatial ability. They found that reading comprehension performance was worse when readers received visual annotations (high cognitive load demand) than when they received verbal annotations (low cognitive load demand). Under the visual annotation condition, the overall meaning construction processes were hindered as more cognitive resources were allocated to select the relevant information from the picture to understand the vocabulary words. Furthermore, recall of word translation was worse for the participants with low verbal and spatial abilities than their counterparts when they received visual annotations with high cognitive load demands; low-ability learners could not build the same number of effective connections between information stored in working memory as their counterparts did. A very recent study employed the dual-task paradigm to investigate the impact of auditory distraction on reading comprehension among participants differing in working memory capacity. The findings revealed that reading comprehension was impaired by background noise consisting of relevant content, which generated more extraneous cognitive load than reading with no noise (low extraneous cognitive load). In addition, participants with high working memory had better reading comprehension (Hao & Conway, 2022). Moreover, a meta-analysis conducted by Kong et  al. (2018) demonstrated that an increased demand in cognitive load induced by unfamiliarity with the reading medium or inferior use of reading strategies impeded readers’ comprehension accuracy. These studies confirm the critical role of cognitive load in reading comprehension performance.

Consistent conclusions were reached in the mobile-assisted reading setting. For instance, Hsu et  al. (2013) studied the effects of a personalized recommendation-based mobile-assisted reading system on high school EFL students’ reading achievement. They found that students who learned with the personalized approach assisted by the annotation function perceived less reading cognitive load in terms of both mental load and mental effort and obtained better reading achievement than their counterparts. Another study investigating the relationship between reading cognitive load and reading comprehension performance among graduate students in the mobile-assisted reading setting found that when learners were instructed to read different types of texts, i.e. static, dynamic, and mixed, under different conditions, i.e. sitting, standing, and walking, using mobile devices, the mixed text display generated the highest extraneous cognitive load and further hindered reading performance (Chen & Lin, 2016). It is important to note that an increase in extraneous cognitive load during reading processes is not necessarily problematic and deleterious, as extraneous cognitive load will evoke germane cognitive load during a highly demanding task, which is beneficial for knowledge learning and task completion (see Zumbach, 2006 and Zumbach & Mohraz, 2008 for further discussion). In summary, previous studies indicate that cognitive load plays a pivotal role in reading comprehension performance both in traditional settings and in mobile-assisted settings. Despite the large body of studies highlighting the influence of cognitive load on reading outcomes, no study has investigated the effects of medium on reading cognitive load, let alone the intersections of medium and reading cognitive load with reading comprehension performance. Therefore, the present study attempts to explore whether there are differences in cognitive load when college EFL learners read from mobile phones versus printed paper and the role of cognitive load in the effects of medium on reading outcomes.

The following section elaborates on previous studies of reading comprehension distinctions across reading media.

# 1.2.  Reading comprehension across reading media

Reading plays a fundamental role in language learners’ achievement and development, especially for foreign or second language learners, because reading is a source of knowledge input and is essential for improving language proficiency and literacy (Yapp et al. 2021). Reading comprehension involves three cognitive processes: (a) locating relevant information, (b) using this information to form a coherent representation, and (c) creating meaning using prior knowledge (Mayer, 1996). Considering the complex and complicated processes of reading comprehension, the issue of whether language learners can achieve equivalent reading comprehension performance on mobile screens compared with traditional reading media has received substantial attention and researchers are seeking to understand the nature of reading assisted by mobile technology (e.g. Gheytasi et  al., 2015; Hou et  al., 2022; Lin, 2014; Yu et  al., 2022; Zou & Ou, 2020). In general, previous work indicates that reading media influence reading comprehension in the dimensions of reading comprehension accuracy, reading speed, strategy use, and cognitive regulation. The following literature review elaborates on the reading comprehension accuracy and reading speed dimensions, as these two aspects are the most cited indicators for reading comprehension processes. In particular, reading speed can reflect language learners’ reading abilities and comprehension processes, and more proficient readers read more quickly and attain more fluent reading comprehension (De Leeuw & De Leeuw, 1965; Fry, 1963; Yu et  al., 2022).

Some studies have reported that learners attain better reading comprehension performance on mobile screens compared with traditional reading media because mobile-assisted language learning applications promote students’ engagement with and preferences for reading activities (Gheytasi et  al., 2015; Lin, 2014), increased the autonomy of their interaction (Gheytasi et  al., 2015) and enhanced their motivation to read (Gheytasi et  al., 2015; Yu et  al., 2022). For instance, a study by Gheytasi et  al. (2015) investigated the effectiveness of mobile-assisted EFL reading among a sample of high school EFL learners and found that students who used mobile-assisted language learning achieved better reading outcomes than their counterparts because the mobile applications provided students with a more convenient means of language learning and enhanced their learning interest and motivation. A recent study comparing college language learners’ EFL reading comprehension performance, i.e. reading speed, reading comprehension accuracy, and cognitive processing behaviors, across four reading conditions (mobile-assisted, tablet-assisted, computer-based, and paper-based) using eye-tracking techniques demonstrated that readers achieved equal reading comprehension accuracy and speed on mobile phones compared with traditional reading media. Moreover, the mobile devices supported more efficient cognitive text processing than the traditional reading media because the mean fixation duration on mobile screens was significantly shorter than that on paper (Hou et  al., 2022).

However, several studies have reported that students achieved better reading comprehension performance on paper than on mobile phones due to lower proficiency and psychological comfort with mobile-assisted language reading, lower metacognitive regulation, and inferior use of reading strategies (e.g. Yu et  al., 2022; Zou & Ou, 2020). In addition, unlike text on paper, students could not track texts or access the entire text on their mobile screens and needed to allocate more cognitive resources for processing the latter reading medium; therefore, their reading comprehension was restricted (Gutiérrez-Colón et  al., 2020). A very recent study compared college EFL students’ reading comprehension performance, i.e. reading scores and reading speed, using mobile screens and paper, and it demonstrated that paper supported better EFL reading comprehension performance than mobile devices in both the reading accuracy and reading speed dimensions (Yu et  al., 2022). A proficient reader might accomplish reading comprehension by quickly locating useful information and engaging in effective cognitive processes with self-regulated reading strategies. However, different reading strategies and self-regulated processes are required for locating, searching, integrating, comprehending, and remembering the text presented on mobile screens and paper, resulting in differences in cognitive effort demands and reading comprehension performance in terms of both accuracy and speed (Yu et al., 2022). Zou and Ou (2020) compared college EFL students’ reading comprehension scores on mobile screens and paper and concluded that psychological factors (e.g. discomfort and low adaptation) and cognitive factors, i.e. inferior metacognition regulation and disruptions, were major reasons explaining the inferior reading performance on mobile screens compared with paper.

Although the effects of mobile reading on EFL learners’ reading comprehension and development reported in the literature are inconsistent, it is true that the nature of mobile-assisted reading differs greatly from that of paper-based reading. The mixed nature of the previous findings demands greater scrutiny of the factors that could explain the effects of reading medium on language learners’ reading comprehension performance. Therefore, we aim to extend previous research by testing a mediator contributing to the effects of the reading medium on EFL learners’ reading achievement. Informed by the literature review, which documented that reading cognitive load is a pivotal variable influencing reading comprehension performance and that reading medium may affect reading comprehension performance, we hypothesize that differences in reading cognitive load mediate the effects of reading medium on reading comprehension performance. To test this hypothesis, we assessed students’ reading cognitive load and reading comprehension performance when using mobile phones and printed paper and applied structural equation modeling to the data. This study is the first to investigate the relationship among reading medium, reading cognitive load, and EFL reading comprehension performance. By examining the mediating factors at play, this study advances our understanding of the effects of medium on language learners’ reading comprehension. In addition, considering that previous research has indicated that English language proficiency moderates the level of perceived cognitive load in the mobile learning context (Chen & Chang, 2011), we also aim to test whether English language proficiency moderates the mediation effects of reading cognitive load if such effects exist. The research questions guiding this empirical study are presented in the following section.

# 1.3.  Research questions

This research is motivated by a series of studies reporting that reading medium influenced readers’ EFL reading comprehension performance in both reading comprehension accuracy and reading speed. The study has two major goals. First, it aims to detect the differences in students’ perceived reading cognitive load across different reading media, i.e. mobile phones and printed paper. Second, it aims to investigate the role of cognitive load in the relationship between reading medium and EFL reading comprehension performance, i.e. reading comprehension accuracy and reading speed. Specifically, this study addresses the following research questions:

1. Are there differences in reading cognitive load when college EFL learners read from mobile phones versus printed paper?   
2. To what extent does reading cognitive load mediate the effect of reading medium on EFL reading comprehension performance? a. To what extent does reading cognitive load mediate the effect of reading medium on EFL reading comprehension accuracy? b. To what extent does reading cognitive load mediate the effect of reading medium on EFL reading speed?

3. If the relationship between reading medium and EFL reading comprehension performance is mediated by reading cognitive load, does the mediation effect differ between EFL learners based on English language proficiency?

# 2.  Methods

# 2.1.  Participants

The participants in this study were from a comprehensive multidisciplinary university in eastern China. They were taking either the compulsory College English Band III or Band IV course to improve their English language proficiency. According to the policy of the college where the current study was administered, first-year college students were classified as intermediate (equivalent to B2 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) or advanced level (equivalent to C1 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) based on their English language scores on college entrance examinations (a national student selection and placement examination administered once a year in China) and were required to take compulsory College English Band III (for intermediate students) or Band IV (for advanced students) courses. As a requirement of the course, they were assigned to read English language e-books weekly through a computer/mobile-assisted EFL reading platform called waiyanyuedu (http:// www.iyangcong.com)1 from the beginning of the semester.

A sample of 10 first-year college students (females $= ~ 6$ , males $= ~ 4$ ) with a mean age of 18.92 years were enlisted to participate in the pilot study (but not the quasiexperiment) for payment. Another sample of 205 students (females $= 9 8$ , males $= 1 0 7 \cdot$ ) from different disciplines (arts $= ~ 3 7$ , engineering $= ~ 6 7$ , natural sciences $\ c = ~ 5 9$ , social sciences $= ~ 4 2 \cdot$ ) with a mean age of 18.87 years from five different classes (including College English Band III and Band IV classes) participated in the quasiexperiment for a thank you gift. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the Department of Psychology and Behavioral Sciences of the university where the study was conducted.

# 2.2.  Instruments

The research instruments included in the present study were reading comprehension tests and questionnaire surveys on reading cognitive load. The reading comprehension tests were adopted directly without any changes from a published study (see Supplementary Materials) (Yu et  al., 2022). They were used to assess the participants’ EFL reading performance using two different reading media. The English language reading comprehension tests were developed with the guidance of the college English language course syllabus and levels of comprehension theory (Alonzo et  al., 2009; Kintsch, 2005) by two teachers and carefully reviewed by another teacher who was an expert in English language teaching and learning to ensure their content validity. These tests were developed based on two chapters from one of the reading materials provided for the students (but not the assigned reading materials for the course)—Harry Potter Power: Free Your Inner Power (Sykley, 2011). The two chapters had similar word counts (658 words in Chapter 2, The Power of Tragedy, and 655 words in Chapter 10, The Greatest Power; see Figure 1 for its appearance on a phone screen). As indicated by the Fry readability formula (Fry, 1968), the two texts had similar readability levels (a level of approximately 5.5). For the text of Power of Tragedy, questions 1, 3, 5, 6 and 9 pertained to the literal comprehension dimension; questions 4, 7 and 10 pertained to the inferential comprehension dimension; and questions 2 and 8 pertained to the evaluative comprehension dimension (ten questions in total). For the text of The Greatest Power, questions 1, 5, 6, 7 and 8 pertained to the literal comprehension dimension; questions 3, 4 and 10 pertained to the inferential comprehension dimension; and questions 2 and 9 pertained to the evaluative comprehension dimension. The criterion validities of the two reading comprehension tests were determined by correlating them with the scores on the final examination, which was recognized as a valid measurement of college English proficiency. The statistical results showed that the Pearson’s $r$ values for the correlations of the two tests with the final exam were 0.318 and 0.335, respectively, which were positively correlated at the $\scriptstyle { p = 0 . 0 1 }$ level. The reliabilities of the tests were determined by calculating Cronbach’s alpha values, and the results indicated very good internal consistency and acceptability of the tests (0.777 for the test in Chapter 2 and 0.853 for the test in Chapter 10) (Gliner et  al., 2017). The texts on the mobile phone screens were presented in Times New Roman font, size 12, with single spacing within the paragraph and double spacing between paragraphs. The printed texts were presented in the same font, size, and space as those on the mobile phone screens. The printed texts, together with the questionnaire surveys, were made into booklets (Figure 1).

Reading cognitive load questionnaires were developed to assess the participants’ perceived cognitive load when reading from the two different reading media (see Supplementary Materials). The questionnaire surveys were administered in the Chinese language. The reading cognitive load questionnaire was developed with reference to a widely accepted and validated framework for measuring cognitive load (Hart & Staveland, 1988) and existing detailed surveys on cognitive load (e.g. Shadiev & Huang, 2020; Yu et  al., 2019). The original cognitive load index included six subscales, namely, mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort, and frustration level. Five dimensions were included in the reading cognitive load questionnaire (see Table 1 for operational definitions of reading cognitive load indices), and the physical demand subscale was excluded considering that no explicit physical demand was required during the reading process. The

# The Power of Tragedy.

# Can Tragedy Increase Power?

As the magic world of Harry Potter shows, power - the ability to be your happiest healthiest and highest self -- arises from the strangest and most unexpected places. This includes dark and difficult situations such as abuse, illness and injury - even the violent death of a loved one. Tragedies, which arrive in shocking shapes at first, can also be incredibly empowering. The worst times in life -- as Harry and his friends show -- can bring out the best in people and free the most important power of all: your inner psychological power.

In Harry's world, many tragic events, bad conditions and hurt things invoke power. After all, didn't a strike from a deadly serpent free Harry's courage, which called to a fabulous bird? Didn't the right magic words spoken in a cold spooky place underground shift apart stone walls, carved with snakes, to reveal a secret chamber? And didn't a wounded key -- the old one with reading cognitive load questionnaire included 16 five-point Likert scale items and four open-ended questions, with items 1, 10, 13, and 15 concerning performance; items 2, 4, 8, 11, and 16 concerning mental demand; items 3 and 5 concerning temporal demand; items 6 and 12 concerning effort; items 7, 9, and 14 concerning frustration level. Four open-ended questions were developed to collect the participants’ reading preferences and reasons (question 17), the reasons for the different perceived cognitive loads (questions 18 and 19), and their comments on mobile-assisted and paper-based EFL reading (question 20).

The construct validities of the questionnaires were assessed through confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs). The CFA analyses yielded good model fit indices for the five-factor correlated model of the mobile-assisted EFL reading cognitive load questionnaire $\tan \alpha$ Bentler, 1999; $\chi ^ { 2 }$ (88) $= 1 5 5 . 0 8$ , $\chi ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { d f } = 1 . 7 6$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ , $\mathrm { C F I } = 0 . 9 5 2$ , $\mathrm { T L I } = 0 . 9 3 4$ , and RMSEA $( 9 0 \% \mathrm { C I } ) = 0 . 0 6 3$ [0.046, 0.079]; acceptable model fit indices were also obtained for the paper-based EFL reading cognitive load questionnaire: $\chi ^ { 2 } ~ ( 8 8 ) ~ = ~ 1 6 2 . 2 5$ , $\chi ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { d f } = 1 . 8 4$ , $p \ : < \ : 0 . 0 0 1$ , $\mathrm { C F I } \ = \ 0 . 9 2 8$ , $\mathrm { T L I } \ = \ 0 . 9 0 2 .$ and RMSEA $( 9 0 \% \ \mathrm { C I } ) = 0 . 0 6 6$ [0.050, 0.082]. In addition, the standardized estimates of the factor loadings were all statistically significant and higher than the cutoff value of 0.40, indicating valid construct validity of the questionnaire (see Figures 2 and 3) (Ford et  al., 1986). The reliabilities of the questionnaires were determined by calculating Cronbach’s alpha, and the results indicated very good internal consistency and acceptability of the questionnaires (0.916 for the mobile-assisted EFL reading cognitive load questionnaire and 0.874 for the paper-based reading cognitive load questionnaire) (Gliner et  al., 2017).

# 2.3.  Data collection

This study was conducted at the end of the semester after the participants had used the mobile-assisted reading application to improve their reading literacy for more than two months. The delivery order of the reading medium (mobile phones versus paper) and reading materials (Chapter 2 versus Chapter 10) were counterbalanced among the participants. Half of the intermediate-level participants first completed the mobile-assisted EFL reading comprehension test (among these participants, half completed the reading test on Chapter 2, while the other half completed the reading test on Chapter 10), followed by the cognitive load questionnaire concerning mobile reading. They then completed the paper-based EFL reading comprehension test (the one different from the mobile-assisted test), followed by a cognitive load questionnaire concerning the paper-based approach. The other half of the participants first completed the paper-based EFL reading comprehension test (among these participants, half completed the reading test on Chapter 2, while the other half completed the reading test on Chapter 10), followed by the cognitive load questionnaire concerning paper reading. They then completed the mobile-assisted EFL reading comprehension test (the one different from the paper-based test), followed by a cognitive load questionnaire concerning the mobile approach. The advanced-level participants followed the same procedure as the intermediate-level participants. All participants were asked to complete the corresponding questionnaire immediately after they finished the reading comprehension test. There was no time limit for the tests and questionnaires. The participants were asked to record the amount of time spent completing the reading comprehension tests with the embedded stopwatch on their mobile phones and to write the time down on the booklet. As reported by the participants, their screen sizes ranged from 4.7 inches to 6.85 inches. Before the experiment, students were asked to check whether the mobile-assisted EFL reading application waiyanyuedu worked well on their mobile phones.

Before the quasiexperiment, a pilot study was conducted to check the readability and accuracy of the reading comprehension tests and questionnaires using a sample of 10 first-year college students who were taking a parallel course to the participants in the quasiexperiment. The pilot study was identical to that of the quasiexperiment and was conducted in a normal classroom. After completing all tasks, the participants were asked to provide comments and feedback on the tests, questionnaires and instructions.

# 2.4.  Data analysis

A total of 205 booklets were collected. Nine copies were excluded from the analyses because the reading comprehension tests were not completed. Three copies were excluded because the questionnaires were not completed. Another two copies were excluded because the same response was provided across almost all items of the questionnaires. These exclusions resulted in $6 . 8 \%$ of the data missing, and 191 booklets were included in the data analyses. A ratio of sample size to the number of measured variables greater than 10:1 is widely recommended for structural equation modeling (Mueller, 1997; Nunnally, 1967; Thompson, 2000). The number of variables measured in the questionnaires in the present study was 16, and the final sample size included in the data analyses was 191, above the required minimum sample size of 160. A quantitative statistical analysis of the students’ responses to the reading comprehension tests and questionnaires and a qualitative analysis of the students’ responses to the open-ended questions were performed. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to assess the students’ reading cognitive load across reading media. Mediation analyses with the reading medium as the predictor, reading cognitive load as a mediator, and reading performance (reading score and reading time) as the dependent variable were performed to evaluate the relationships among the reading medium, reading cognitive load, and reading performance. Mediation analysis is a statistical method used to test hypotheses about how the causal antecedent variable $X$ affects the consequent variable $Y$ through intervening variable $M$ (Hayes, 2022). Considering that one of the research questions of the present study is to investigate the mechanism by which the reading medium (antecedent variable $X$ ) influences reading comprehension performance (consequent variable Y), mediation analysis is a suitable statistical method to test the role of cognitive load (intervening variable $M$ ). The overall mediation models were evaluated with the $\chi ^ { 2 }$ test and conventional model fit indices, the comparative fit index (CFI), the Tucker–Lewis index (TLI), and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA). The mediation effect was detected by testing the significance of the indirect path from the predictor to the outcome variable through the mediator (Jöreskog, 1993; MacKinnon et  al., 2007). The Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) version 22.0 and its AMOS program were used to perform the analyses (Arbuckle, 2013).

Reading comprehension accuracy was indicated by the scores on the reading comprehension tests; each correct answer received one point (ten points in total). Reading time data were obtained through students’ self-reports and translated into seconds for data analyses. The participants’ responses to the closed-ended items in the questionnaire were scored on a 5-point Likert scale. For the positive worded items (e.g. ‘I am satisfied with my performance when I read from mobile phones’), ‘1’ represented ‘Strongly Agree’, and ‘5’ represented ‘Strongly Disagree’. For the reverse-worded items (e.g. ‘I feel much time pressure when I read from mobile phones’), ‘1’ represented ‘Strongly Disagree’, and $^ { \mathfrak { c } } 5 ^ { \mathfrak { d } }$ represented ‘Strongly Agree’. The descriptive analyses of the questionnaires are presented in Appendices A and B. The participants’ responses to the four open-ended questions were coded with an open coding method. Guided by Glaser’s (1992) grounded-theory procedures, two authors first obtained a general sense of the data by performing a quick reading of all responses; then, they independently read five randomly selected copies sentence-by-sentence and assigned labels to the propositions. Next, the two coders discussed the labels together to find patterns. Responses were categorized into core dimensions according to the theme conveyed based on the cognitive load framework (e.g. ‘I read faster when I read from mobile phones’ was classified into the ‘performance’ dimension). After agreement was reached, the coders independently coded the remaining responses based on the established coding scheme. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.

# 3.1.  Students’ reading cognitive load across reading media

A 2 (reading medium type: mobile phones vs. paper) $\times ~ 5$ (cognitive load type: performance, mental demand, temporal demand, effort, and frustration level) within-subjects repeated-measures analysis of variances (ANOVAs) was performed to assess students’ reading cognitive load across reading media. The analysis revealed main effects of reading medium, $F ( 1 , \ 1 9 0 ) \ : = \ : 1 2 3 . 8 7$ , $p { < } 0 . 0 0 1$ , $\Pi ^ { 2 } \ \mathsf { p } = 0 . 3 9 5$ , and cognitive load, $F ( 4 , ~ 7 6 0 ) ~ = ~ 1 1 4 . 7 1$ , $p { < } 0 . 0 0 1$ , $\eta 2 \ \ p = 0 . 3 7 6$ , and a reliable interaction between reading medium and reading cognitive load, $F ( 4 , 7 6 0 ) = 2 9 . 6 5 .$ $p { < } 0 . 0 0 1$ , $\eta 2 \ \ p = 0 . 1 3 5$ (see Figure 4; for the means and standard deviations of each type of reading cognitive load, see Table 2). Pairwise comparisons with the Bonferroni correction showed that the score for mobile-assisted reading cognitive load was significantly higher than that for paper-based reading cognitive load in terms of performance, $F ( 1 ,$ $1 9 0 ) = 9 6 . 2 5 $ , $\textstyle p < 0 . 0 0 1$ , $\boldsymbol { \eta } 2 \ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { p } } = 0 . 3 3 6 ;$ mental demand, $F ( 1 , 1 9 0 ) = 2 3 1 . 0 6 $ $p { < } 0 . 0 0 1$ , $\eta 2 \ \ p = 0 . 5 4 9$ ; temporal demand, $F ( 1 , \ 1 9 0 ) \ = \ 5 3 . 5 5 $ , $p { < } 0 . 0 0 1$ , $\eta 2 \ \ p = 0 . 2 2 0$ ; effort, $F ( 1 , \ 1 9 0 ) \ = \ 2 9 . 2 9$ , $p { < } 0 . 0 0 1$ , $\eta 2 \ \ p = 0 . 1 3 4$ ; and frustration level, $F ( 1 , \ 1 9 0 ) \ = \ 6 0 . 3 9 1$ , $p { < } 0 . 0 0 1$ , $\eta 2 \ \ p = 0 . 2 4 1$ . These results indicated that participants perceived greater cognitive load when they read from mobile phones than from paper for all five indicators of reading cognitive load. For students’ self-reported reasons for differences in text comprehension and reading task completion, see Tables 3 and 4.

# 3.2.  Reading media to reading comprehension performance—the role of cognitive load 3.2.1.  Cognitive load as a mediator of reading comprehension accuracy differences across media

To determine whether the relationship between the reading medium and EFL reading comprehension accuracy was mediated by reading cognitive load, a mediation structural equation model was tested. The mediation model was estimated with the maximum likelihood method, and confidence intervals for parameters were obtained by bias-corrected bootstrapping with 5,000 iterations (Bollen & Stine, 1990). Parameters with confidence intervals excluding zero were considered significant. The results of the mediation analysis showed acceptable model fit (Hu & Bentler, 1999; $\chi ^ { 2 } \left( 1 2 3 \right) = 3 9 0 . 2 6$ , $\chi ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { d f } = 3 . 1 7$ , $p { < } 0 . 0 0 1$ , $\mathrm { C F I } = 0 . 9 2 2$ , $\mathrm { T L I } = 0 . 9 0 3$ , RMSEA $( 9 0 \% \ \mathrm { C I } ) \ = \ 0 . 0 7 5$ [0.066, 0.084]. The direct path from reading medium to reading comprehension accuracy was not significant, $\beta \ =$ −0.044, $9 5 \%$ CI $\left[ - 0 . 1 6 8 , \ 0 . 0 7 7 \right]$ , $ { p }  { = } 0 . 4 7 8$ . However, the indirect path from reading medium to reading cognitive load was significant, $\beta \ =$ −0.590, $9 5 \%$ CI $\left[ - 0 . 6 6 5 , \ - 0 . 5 0 5 \right]$ , $p { < } 0 . 0 0 1$ , and the indirect path from reading cognitive load to reading comprehension accuracy was also significant, $\beta ~ = ~ - 0 . 2 9 1 , ~ 9 5 \%$ CI $[ - 0 . 4 2 1 , ~ - 0 . 1 5 6 ]$ , $\mathit { p } { < } 0 . 0 0 1$ (see Table 5). The effect size of the indirect effect was large, kappa-squared $( \mathrm { K } ^ { 2 } ) ~ =$ 0.555 (Preacher & Kelley, 2011). These results confirmed the complete mediating role of reading cognitive load in the relationship between reading medium and reading comprehension accuracy (see Figure 5).

3.2.2.  Cognitive load as a mediator of reading speed differences across media To determine whether the relationship between the reading medium and EFL reading speed was mediated by reading cognitive load, another mediation structural equation model was tested. The results of the mediation analysis showed acceptable model fit $\mathrm { H u } \ \&$ Bentler, 1999; $\chi ^ { 2 }$ $( 1 2 3 ) = 4 0 2 . 9 6$ , $\chi ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { d f } = 3 . 2 8$ , $\textstyle p < 0 . 0 0 1$ , $\mathrm { C F I } = 0 . 9 1 8$ , $\mathrm { T L I } = 0 . 8 9 8$ , RMSEA $( 9 0 \% \ \mathrm { C I } ) = 0 . 0 7 7$ [0.069, 0.086]. The direct path from reading medium to reading time was not significant, $\beta = - 0 . 0 0 7$ , $9 5 \%$ CI [–0.127, 0.145], $\hbar = 0 . 9 2 0$ . However, the indirect path from reading medium to reading cognitive load was significant, $\beta \ = \ - 0 . 5 9 0$ , $9 5 \%$ CI $\left[ - 0 . 6 6 5 , \ - 0 . 5 0 5 \right]$ $p { < } 0 . 0 0 1$ , and the indirect path from reading cognitive load to reading time was also significant, $\beta = 0 . 1 2 0$ , $9 0 \%$ CI [0.003, 0.231], $ { p }  { = } 0 . 0 7 8$ (see Table 6). The effect size of the indirect effect was large, kappa-squared $\mathrm { K } ^ { 2 } = 0 . 4 0$ (Preacher & Kelley, 2011). These results confirmed the complete mediating role of reading cognitive load in the relationship between reading medium and reading speed (see Figure 6).

# 3.3.  Multigroup mediation analysis

# 3.3.1.  Role of language proficiency in the mediation model for reading comprehension accuracy

To determine whether the participants’ English language proficiency moderated the mediation model of the reading medium, reading cognitive load, and reading comprehension accuracy, a multigroup mediation analysis was performed. The whole sample was divided into two groups, a high English language proficiency group and a low English language proficiency group, based on the participants’ scores on the final examination in the college English course. The top 50th percentile of the participants was labeled the high English language proficiency group $( N { = } 9 5 )$ , and the bottom 50th percentile of the participants was labeled the low English language proficiency group $\left( N { = } 9 6 \right)$ . The College English Language Final Examination is a summative assessment of EFL learners at the university where the study was conducted. It is administered at the end of the semester to evaluate EFL students’ learning outcomes. The highest possible score on the examination is 100, and the examination covers vocabulary, listening, reading, and writing. The cutoff point for splitting the sample was 80. Table 7 presents the means and standard deviations of the student’s perceived reading cognitive load according to the two reading media and two language proficiency levels.

$\chi ^ { 2 }$ difference tests were used to assess the difference in mediation effects for the two English language proficiency groups (Bentler, 1990; Jöreskog, 1993). Accordingly, an unconstrained model in which all paths were estimated freely and a constrained model in which all paths were constrained to be the same for the two groups were tested. The constrained model fit $( \chi ^ { 2 } \ : ( 2 7 5 ) = 5 7 9 . 1 8 5$ , $\chi ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { d f } = 2 . 1 1$ , ${ p / < 0 . 0 0 1 }$ , $\mathrm { C F I } = 0 . 9 1 3$ , $\mathrm { T L I } = 0 . 9 0 3$ , RMSEA $( 9 0 \% \ \mathrm { C I } ) = 0 . 0 7 6$ [0.067, 0.085]) did not differ significantly from the unconstrained model fit $( \chi ^ { 2 } ~ ( 2 7 2 ) ~ = ~ 5 7 7 . 6 6 .$ , $\chi ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { d f } = 2 . 1 2$ , ${ p / < 0 . 0 0 1 }$ , $\mathrm { C F I } = 0 . 9 1 2 ,$ $\mathrm { T L I } ~ = ~ 0 . 9 0 1$ , RMSEA $( 9 0 \% \ \mathrm { C I } ) \ = \ 0 . 0 7 7$ [0.068, 0.085]), $\chi ^ { 2 } ~ ( 3 ) ~ = ~ 1 . 5 2 ,$ $\scriptstyle P = 0 . 6 7 7$ . This result indicated that the mediation effect of reading cognitive load on the relationship between reading medium and reading score existed in both the high and low English language proficiency groups.

3.3.2.  Role of language proficiency in the mediation model for reading speed To determine whether the participants’ English language proficiency moderated the mediation model of the reading medium, reading cognitive load, and the reading speed, another multigroup mediation analysis was performed. An unconstrained model in which all paths were estimated freely and a constrained model in which all paths were constrained to be the same for the two groups were tested. The constrained model fit $( \chi ^ { 2 }$ $( 2 7 5 ) = 6 0 4 . 0 9$ , $\chi ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { d f } = 2 . 2 0$ , ${ p / < 0 . 0 0 1 }$ , $\mathrm { C F I } = 0 . 9 0 6$ , $\mathrm { T L I } = 0 . 8 9 5$ , RMSEA $( 9 0 \% \ \mathrm { C I } ) \ = \ 0 . 0 7 9$ [0.071, 0.088]) did not differ significantly from the unconstrained model fit $( \chi ^ { 2 } ~ ( 2 7 2 ) = 6 0 2 . 2 4 $ , $\chi ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { d f } = 2 . 2 1$ , ${ p / < 0 . 0 0 1 }$ , $\mathrm { C F I } =$ 0.905, $\mathrm { T L I } = 0 . 8 9 3$ , RMSEA $( 9 0 \% \ \mathrm { C I } ) \ = \ 0 . 0 8 0$ [0.071, 0.088]), $\chi ^ { 2 } \ ( 3 ) \ =$ 1.52, $\scriptstyle P = 0 . 6 0 4$ . This result indicated that the mediation effect of reading cognitive load on the relationship between reading medium and reading speed existed in both the high and low English language proficiency groups.

# 4.  Discussion

This study aims to investigate the impact of reading medium on reading cognitive load and the effect of reading cognitive load on the relationship between reading medium and EFL reading comprehension performance. Overall, the results suggest that the participants perceived greater cognitive load when reading from mobile phones than when reading from paper. In addition, impact of reading medium on EFL reading comprehension performance, i.e. reading comprehension accuracy and reading speed, was fully mediated by reading cognitive load, and this mediation effect was independent of the participants’ levels of English language proficiency.

# 4.1.  Effects of the reading medium on students’ reading cognitive load

The present study extends related research on the effects of the reading medium on EFL reading comprehension by examining the distinctions in reading cognitive load imposed by the reading medium. Overall, the results indicate that mobile devices and paper generated different levels of reading cognitive load for all five dimensions—mental effort, temporal demand, effort, performance, and frustration level. First, concerning mental demand, mental and perceptual activities such as searching, remembering, and thinking are required during reading, and mobile devices invited more mental effort than paper did. Since the reading materials and reading formats were counterbalanced among the participants, the effects of medium on reading cognitive load could not be attributed to the difference in intrinsic cognitive load. In other words, the different levels of reading cognitive load for the two reading media were caused by extraneous cognitive load: the texts presented on mobile phones generated more extraneous cognitive load than those presented on paper. This finding agrees with cognitive load theory, which claims that extraneous cognitive load is generated by the manner in which the information is presented to learners (Sweller, 2010; Sweller et  al., 2011).

In addition, the finding that mobile devices invited more extraneous cognitive load is consistent with previous studies that have documented that, compared with paper, mobile screens do not afford text-tracking and coherence building and consequently invite additional cognitive processing efforts (Gutiérrez-Colón et  al., 2020; Yu et  al., 2022). Additionally, it agrees with the finding that it is more difficult for EFL readers to remember relevant information and build a schema on mobile screens (Yu et  al., 2022; Zou & Ou, 2020). Mobile devices generate less germane cognitive load, a type of cognitive load that is encouraged to optimize the subject’s performance, than that generated by paper. As reading comprehension is an active cognitive process in which readers construct meaning using prior knowledge with various strategies, such as text tracking, important information selection, and map building, these aforementioned factors may combine to generate more mental demand and restrict reading speed, leading to more temporal demand. Previous research regarding hypertext reading documented that readers with sufficient prior knowledge of the topic are not influenced by the availability of a structural overview ( Potelle & Rouet, 2003; for a review, see DeStefano & LeFevre, 2007 ). Considering that the restriction of structural overviews has been frequently mentioned as a major disadvantage of mobile reading (e.g. Yu et  al., 2022), future studies are needed to empirically test the effects of structural overviews and its interaction with prior knowledge in influencing the processes of mobile-assisted language reading.

Second, concerning the amount of effort invested during reading comprehension, the readers reported that they needed to allocate more focused attention to comprehend the text and better prepare to accomplish their reading goals in the reading comprehension test when using the mobile-assisted approach. It is widely acknowledged that students’ attention to learning content is an antecedent of learning outcomes because, for effective learning to occur, a learner needs to identify important information and allocate extra attention to process it (Hlas et  al., 2019; Yang et  al., 2022). Attention maintenance is a behavioral and cognitive process in which a learner responds to the information presented (Smith & Kosslyn, 2013). When the students read from mobile devices, they needed to allocate more focused attention to comprehending the text and therefore perceived a higher level of reading cognitive load than they did when reading from paper. Moreover, according to theories of reading cognitive load, to comprehend a text, readers begin with visual word recognition and construct meaning under the constraints of limited working memory (DeStefano & LeFevre, 2007; Khalifa & Weir, 2009; Plass et  al., 2003). However, visual words seem less recognizable on mobile screens than on paper, even though the text is presented in exactly the same manner on both media (Yu et  al., 2022); therefore, more focused attention is directed to recognizing visual words on the mobile screens at the very beginning of reading comprehension. This difference might tax more working memory resources and restrict reading comprehension in the very early stages under the limited capacity of working memory. However, this assumption remains speculative and needs to be empirically tested.

Third, concerning the frustration level, the participants became tired more easily and were more stressed when reading from mobile screens than when reading from paper. This result agrees with previous findings that eye strain is the most cited disadvantage of mobile-assisted EFL reading (Yu et  al., 2022). The physical discomfort imposed by the reading medium is independent of the inherent nature of the reading materials but is extrinsically generated by the manner of delivery. This finding highlights the importance of the argument that extraneous cognitive load should be minimized to optimize instructional design (Sweller, 2010; Sweller et  al., 2011). Combined with the reasons mentioned above, such as the need for more mental effort, greater fatigue, and greater temporal demand perceived due to lower reading speed, it is not surprising that the participants reported a lower level of confidence in mobile-assisted EFL reading outcomes. Based on these findings, it is highly recommended that text on mobile screens be presented in a manner that promotes visual word recognition, chapter navigation, relevant information location, coherence construction, and schema construction to reduce extraneous cognitive load. Furthermore, teachers should pay special attention to promoting students’ germane cognitive load by helping them build coherence, connect prior knowledge, and construct schema when instructing them to read from mobile devices.

# 4.2.  Mediation effects of reading cognitive load

This study contributes important knowledge to the field by revealing the role of reading cognitive load in mediating the effects of the reading medium on EFL reading comprehension performance (both reading accuracy and reading speed). This study is the first to directly test a factor mediating the relationship between reading medium and EFL reading comprehension performance. By directly testing the mediation of the relationship between reading medium and reading comprehension performance, a better understanding of how reading medium affects reading comprehension can be achieved. As such, more insightful implications for promoting EFL learners’ reading proficiency on mobile screens can be derived. Previous studies have shown that reading medium is a predictor of EFL reading comprehension performance (e.g. Yu et  al., 2022; Zou & Ou, 2020). The present study further demonstrates that the effects of medium on reading comprehension performance (both reading comprehension accuracy and reading speed) in EFL contexts were fully mediated by reading cognitive load and that this mediation effect was independent of the students’ levels of English language proficiency. When reading cognitive load was taken into consideration, the direct effects of the reading medium on reading comprehension performance became nonsignificant. These results suggest that reading cognitive load is greatly influenced by reading medium and itself functions to influence EFL learners’ reading comprehension. This finding highlights the important role of reading cognitive load in language learners’ reading comprehension and indicates that extra attention should be given to optimizing reading cognitive load when mobile-assisted EFL reading is integrated into students’ language learning. Structural equation modeling is inherently a large-sample technique, and a large sample (usually greater than 200) is needed to achieve an efficient and stable estimation (Mueller, 1997; Thompson, 2000). In particular, the maximum likelihood estimator used in the present study is based on the assumption of an asymptotic normal distribution when the sample size becomes arbitrarily large (Bentler & Dudgeon, 1996). A medium sample size (191) was used in the present study; therefore, the collection of larger samples in future studies is recommended to obtain more efficient estimations and stable results.

As mentioned in the introduction, reading comprehension is an active self-regulated meaning-construction process (Oxford, 2017) that begins with visual word recognition to select relevant information and finally constructs meaning under the constraints of limited working memory (DeStefano & LeFevre, 2007; Khalifa & Weir, 2009; Plass et  al., 2003). It is accomplished by retrieving prior knowledge from long-term memory, building schemata, storing relevant information in short-term memory, and integrating all cognitive resources to construct the meaning of the text (Khalifa & Weir, 2009; Van den Broek et  al., 2016). Nevertheless, as discussed in the previous section, visual words seem less recognizable on mobile screens with more extraneous cognitive load generation (Yu et  al., 2022), which hinders the bottom-up processing of text and constrains reading comprehension in the very early stages. In addition, as the participants reported, memorizing information from mobile screens was harder than that from paper, which suggests that the process of storing relevant information in short-term memory is hindered during mobile reading. The difficulty of retaining text content might be attributable to the ineffective building of schemata with the activation of prior knowledge or a mental model from their existing knowledge structure in long-term memory during mobile reading.

Moreover, as previous work suggests that a relaxed mind leads to improved task attention (Shadiev & Huang, 2020) and that focused attention on learning content promotes students’ learning outcomes (Hlas et  al., 2019; Yang et  al., 2022), the temporal stress and frustration perceived by students during mobile reading might also restrict meaning construction. These factors possibly combined to hinder the students’ reading comprehension accuracy and speed when they read from mobile devices, and the impact was independent of the students’ levels of English language proficiency according to the results of the multigroup mediation analyses. Future studies are warranted to test these assumptions directly by examining whether and how reading medium functions to influence the information storage and retrieval processes and consequently reading comprehension. A single mediator (cognitive load) was tested in the present study, but according to the recent literature on medium differences in reading comprehension performance, multiple possible mediators might exist, such as metacognition (Singer Trakhman et  al., 2022), reading interest (Clinton-Lisell, 2022), and proficiency in employing reading strategies (Yu et  al., 2022). Therefore, future studies including multiple possible mediators as mentioned above in the mediation model are recommended to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of medium on reading comprehension performance.

# 5.  Conclusion

The present study contributes to the growing knowledge of the effects of reading medium, i.e. mobile phone or paper, on college EFL students’ reading comprehension performance, i.e. reading comprehension accuracy and reading speed, in relation to reading cognitive load. Importantly, it demonstrates that the effects of reading medium on EFL reading comprehension performance are completely mediated by reading cognitive load and that these mediation effects are independent of students’ English language proficiency. It advances our understanding of EFL students’ reading processes using different media by revealing how these variables are correlated. Overall, the results of this study suggest that mobile reading generates more reading cognitive load for college EFL readers than reading from paper; the effect of the reading medium on reading comprehension performance is fully mediated by reading cognitive load, and this mediation effect exists in both high and low English language proficiency groups, which indicates the robust mediation role of reading cognitive load. Mobile-assisted EFL reading is increasingly utilized to assist EFL students’ learning, and this study reports students’ actual reading experiences with different reading media and, importantly, sheds light on how to use mobile phones to assist language pedagogical practice. The findings can be used to develop more insightful and effective instructions for fostering students’ reading competency and literacy using mobile phones and further improve their reading experience and learning achievement.
