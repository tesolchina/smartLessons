In light of globalization and international travel, English plays a predominant role in the tourism and hospitality industries. Hence, effective communication in English becomes a requisite skill for Food and Beverage (F&B) employees, especially in luxury resorts. Nonetheless, there has been limited research into the linguistic needs of these employees. This preliminary study explored the English language needs and problems encountered by F&B staff at a 5-star resort in Vietnam in a post-pandemic context. Data included two sets of questionnaires and semi-structured interviews of full-time F&B employees and related stakeholders. In addition, an analysis of Tripadvisor reviews was utilized to understand customers’ opinions about the employees’ English abilities. The findings showed that the F&B employees perform various tasks requiring four English skills in their daily work. Regarding problems, these employees considered listening and writing to be the most difficult skills. Also, the F&B employees expected an ESP course prioritizing speaking and listening skills to mitigate the lack of exposure to English due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its concomitant travel restrictions. Based on the findings, practical course syllabi and pedagogical implications for related ESP courses were developed.

# 1. Introduction

In the internationalization process of today’s business world, proficiency in English has become crucial, particularly within the tourism and hospitality industries. As one of Asia’s leading tourist destinations, Vietnam has experienced unprecedented growth in international tourist arrivals, with approximately $8 0 \%$ of them opting for 4–5-star hotels as their preferred accommodation (Vietnam Lodging Industry, 2020). Given these impressive statistics, proficient communication in English is deemed essential for the operations of luxury hotels. As a result, there is an increasing need for English for Specific Purposes (ESP) training designed to address particular linguistic needs of staff within the luxury hospitality sector.

Within the 5-star hotel’s service sequences, the English competence of Food and Beverage (F&B) employees is of paramount importance in service delivery, guest satisfaction, and revenue generation as these staff are supposed to have the most contact with guests through varied interactions. Accordingly, being aware of the F&B staff’s English needs and providing continuous on-the-job training significantly improves the quality of F&B and general hotel services.

In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic posed uncharted challenges to the hotel business and its employees’ professional and English skills in Vietnam (Ngoc, 2022). Specifically, the pandemic, its concomitant travel restrictions, and hotel closures have drastically limited opportunities for English language interaction and led to subsequent degradation of the English skills of hotel employees. As a result, the urge to understand the English needs and challenges facing hotel F&B employees in the postpandemic situation becomes even more critical than ever. This insight is crucial for developing training programs that effectively rebuild their English skills to pre-pandemic levels.

Needs analysis (NA) is fundamental to the design, implementation, and evaluation of any ESP course. This aims to guarantee that students acquire the specific language skills they need. Over the years, NA has been carried out for learners in various fields of business and academia, including lawyers (Chovancová, 2014), police officers (Aldohon, 2014), engineers (Chalak & Nilforoush, 2016; Cowling, 2007; Spence & Liu, 2013), nurses (Lu, 2018), and other settings. Relevant to the current study, numerous NA studies have been conducted in the hospitality field (Do & Cheng, 2021; Jasso-Aguilar, 1999; Pongganta, 2019). However, concerning research methodology, few adopted multifarious methods and sources for data collection and analysis (Jasso-Aguilar, 1999). In existing literature, leading researchers (e.g., Brown, 2009, 2016; Hutchinson & Waters, 1987) have recommended using varied methods and information sources to pinpoint and ascertain learners’ target needs. Long (2005a, 2005b) proposed the task-based NA methodology, identifying the role of three crucial elements while gathering information about the targeted tasks: Sources, methods, and triangulation. More specifically, Serafini et al. (2015) suggested that a comprehensively reliable and valid NA research should adopt a methodological checklist including three elements that are similar to but slightly distinct from those mentioned above: Sources (insiders and outsiders), methods (qualitative and quantitative, open-to-closed order, pilot), and triangulations (validate and consider cultural factors).

Considering the exigency of investigating the English needs and problems of Vietnamese F&B employees in 5-star resorts, this study follows the methodological recommendations by Long (2005a, 2005b) and Serafini et al. (2015). It aims to conduct a comprehensive needs analysis integrating data from various sources and methods, ensuring a robust triangulation procedure. In further detail, insights from in-service F&B employees, related stakeholders, and Tripadvisor comments were collected through questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and guest review analysis. These diverse data sources were then triangulated to strengthen the methodological rigor and reliability of the results. Through employing this approach, this study seeks to deepen the understanding of the F&B employees’ English needs and problems, especially in the post-pandemic context, and to develop a tailored English training syllabus that meets the participants’ expectations.

# 2. Review of literature

# 2.1. Needs analysis

NA provides the essential groundwork for creating effective teaching materials, pedagogical content, and methodologies essential for a successful ESP course. According to Hyland (2006), NA is the data collection method that rationales the syllabus or curriculum development to meet the particular needs of learners or employees. Similarly, Brown (2016) indicated that “if there is no needs analysis, there is no ESP” (p. 5). From an analytical perspective, NA in ESP refers to a process of developing courses involving target situation analysis, present situation analysis, discourse analysis, teaching context analysis, and learner factor analysis (Basturkmen, 2010). From a methodological perspective, both ESP specialists and task-based researchers contend that utilizing tasks as the basis for analysis and organization improves the effectiveness of NA, as tasks create an optimal context for adult learners to connect forms and functions for communication (Serafini et al., 2015). It is hoped that through holistic and thorough investigation, data collected from multiple sources of information through multiple methods can be utilized to identify and enhance the “what” as well as the “how” of an ESP course.

# 2.2. NA studies in F&B field

While this research focuses on the NA of F&B employees in 5-star hotels, it is worth looking into two strands of literature related to the English learning needs and problems of F&B employees in hotels and other workplaces for a comprehensive understanding of specific and general insights. That being the case, English NAs related to F&B employees in hotel restaurants will be introduced first, followed by those related to English use for restaurant services in general.

Regarding the NAs of F&B employees in hotels, Santoso (2016) examined the English linguistic needs of the servers and waiters at a four-star hotel in Indonesia. Based on the analysis of interviews, the findings indicated that listening and speaking skills were the most commonly used by the servers and waiters since they needed to communicate with the guests in the hotel. Moreover, listening problems were identified at the workplace due to exposure to unfamiliar accents and dialects.

Mahardika (2018) also explored F&B employees’ communicative needs in Indonesian star hotels (not specified regarding the rankings) through interviews, observations, and report analysis. The results indicated that verbal communication was essential, and grammar was considered secondary while performing job duties. Besides, writing and reading skills were perceived as less critical than speaking and listening skills because only supervisors or department heads needed to write memos, reports, and emails.

In the context of Thailand, Pongganta (2019) administered an online questionnaire to 40 F&B staff working in hotels (including 20 from boutique hotels and the other 20 from five-star hotels). The findings showed that listening and speaking skills were highly needed. In addition, in terms of course design, specific English for the food and beverage business, listening skills for communicating with foreign customers, and conversations for making a good impression should be incorporated into the syllabus. Furthermore, participants preferred to be instructed in both English and Thai, and the English training should be conducted within the hotel after work for ease of participation.

Through interviews and observations, Kusdianti (2020) conducted a study at an international hotel in Indonesia (classified as 4- to 5-star according to Tripadvisor). The findings revealed that the waitstaff possessed fundamental English-speaking skills, though certain aspects required further enhancement to prevent difficulties in serving and communicating with guests, especially those from abroad.

While the above studies were related to NAs in hotel settings, the followings are regarding NAs of F&B employees in other workplaces. Siddiqui and Naz (2016) explored F&B employees’ English language use and employability in India through semistructured interviews. The results showed that the F&B employees with sufficient English competence were more likely to be recruited than other competitors. Furthermore, in these restaurants, employees were expected to make telephone calls in English. In addition, as part of their job requirements, the employees of these food chains received continuous on-the-job English training focusing on common structures, lessons on greetings and thanking, the scripts in various work-related communicative events such as order taking, apologizing, responding to complaints, requesting, among other things. Overall, speaking and listening, including phone conversations, were critical skills for the employees of these food chains to serve and handle guests’ requests and complaints.

Do (2021) investigated the needs of 20 employees of the New Century Restaurant in Hanoi, Vietnam for an ESP course through structured interviews. Research results indicated that most of the employees wanted to review basic English knowledge and English for business communication (speaking and writing skills) with a focus on activities such as spoken and written transactions with foreigners, English telephone conversations, translation from English to Vietnamese, and vice versa, and other tasks. Also, some problems described by these employees while joining an ESP course included the lack of time and resources for learning English, namely audio-visual aids, the lack of concentration due to noise in the learning environment, different English proficiency levels, and learning needs.

Another study conducted by Tipan (2021) involved hotel and restaurant management students in their practicum (preservice) in the Philippines. The analysis of questionnaire data revealed that the participants had a significant need to improve their proficiency in all four English language skills and experienced language-related difficulties while performing their duties in the hotel. Several factors were attributed to their difficulties in English communication, including limited exposure to the target language and anxieties about using English at work. Also, they noted that improving vocabulary and grammar skills is essential. As a result, schools were suggested to realign their curriculum to accurately reflect the English skills needed and the challenges faced by students.

Nova (2021) assessed various virtual learning media for teaching English to restaurant staff in Indonesia. This study involved hospitality management students specializing in F&B Service who attended an ESP course on Google Classroom. The findings showed that videos were the most favored medium, followed by video conferencing, podcasts, and PowerPoint presentations. The combination of audio and visual elements in videos made them more engaging and easier to understand, thus enhancing students’ English skills. In contrast, PowerPoint presentations, being limited to a single mode of delivery, were less engaging and frequently resulted in student disinterest. Hence, the study recommended that English instructors incorporate more video simulations in virtual learning environments to boost teaching and learning effectiveness.

From the above studies, some gaps were identified. First, there has been a distinct lack of studies on the English needs of F&B employees in 5-star luxury hotels. Thus far, existing NA studies have focused on F&B employees in 4- or 5-star hotels or regular restaurants and students majoring in hospitality. These learners’ needs and expectations may differ significantly from those of F&B employees working in 5-star luxury hotels in terms of guest service delivery and satisfaction. In particular, in the Vietnamese context, as far as the authors are aware, almost no study has been conducted to explore the English needs of F&B employees at 5-star hotels and resorts, which serve $8 0 \%$ of the international tourists visiting Vietnam.

Second, concerning research methodology, most studies tend to include only one or two data sources (Do, 2021; Nova, 2021; Santoso, 2016; Siddiqui & Naz, 2016). They do not involve related stakeholders or information based on guest reviews (Kusdianti, 2020; Pongganta, 2019; Tipan, 2021). Currently, only one study included multiple sources (interviews, observations, document analysis), which was conducted by Mahardika (2018). However, Mahardika’s study only recruited a limited number of participants (three). Also, it did not offer insights from the guests – one of the most significant interlocutors with F&B employees, which is what our study aimed to include. Overall, there has been a scarcity of task-based needs analyses (Long, 2005a, 2005b; Serafini et al., 2015), which entails meticulous collection and analysis of comprehensive data from diverse sources to yield detailed and contextually grounded insights pertaining to specific circumstances.

Therefore, it is essential to explore the English language needs, challenges, and expectations of F&B staff at a 5-star resort to guide the creation of an ESP course that supports their professional advancement, particularly considering the impact of the post-pandemic situation.

# 2.3. Research aims and questions

Within the scope of investigating the English needs of F&B employees in the 5-star resort, this study aims to examine four aspects. First, it explores the tasks requiring employees to use English in the workplace. Dudley-Evans and St. John (1998) indicated that the initial step in ESP analysis is to acquire professional knowledge regarding tasks and activities that learners currently perform or will need to perform. Second, it is essential to inquire into the challenges facing the F&B employees while using English at work, which is a crucial step toward planning practical ESP training. Third, the study aims to delve into the F&B employees’ pre-job and on-the-job English learning experience. Learners’ English learning experience prior to recruitment may indicate their proficiency level, the factors affecting how they learn English, and their attitudes and motivation toward learning. Meanwhile, the current English learning experience may reveal further insights into the contextual constraints and strengths (Brown, 2016), including considerations such as materials, equipment, facilities, funding, other resources, as well as cultural factors that may influence ESP course instruction. Finally, the study examines the employees’ expectations of an ESP course for professional development, which Hutchinson and Waters (1987) describe as “learners’ wants” while Dudley-Evans and St. John (1998) refer to as “learning needs”. Acknowledging the significance of learner motivation in the process of language acquisition, their “wants” must be adequately considered as one of the most critical factors in determining the training syllabus and implementation.

In response to the above-mentioned aims, this study was guided by the following research questions:

1. What tasks do F&B employees frequently perform in English in their workplace?   
2. What problems do they perceive they encounter when using English at work?   
3. How have they been trained in English skills prior to recruitment and on the job?   
4. What are their expectations of English training for professional development?

# 3. Methodology

# 3.1. Settings

The research was conducted at InterContinental Danang Sun Peninsula Resort (ICDN) in Danang City, a 5-star luxury beach resort managed by the international InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG). The resort is famous for its unique architecture blended with local heritage in world-class design. It was officially opened in 2012 with 201 luxury rooms and villas. The F&B staff working at five restaurants and dining outlets participated in this study, namely Citron Restaurant, Barefoot Restaurant, In-room Dining, The Long Bar, and Beach & Pool. The reason for choosing InterContinental Danang Sun Peninsula Resort is because it represents the 5-star luxury resort category in Vietnam. Therefore, it is hoped that the data collected could provide insight into the English needs and problems of the F&B employees in an international context and contributes to the scholarship in hospitality and tourism.

# 3.2. Instruments

Considering the methodological recommendations (Long, 2005a, 2005b; Serafini et al., 2015) and purposes of this study, a mixed-method case study approach was conducted, employing both quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative data included responses to two sets of online questionnaires, whereas the qualitative data included information from two sets of semi-structured interviews and Tripadvisor reviews.

In further detail, two separate sets of bi-lingual (Vietnamese-English) Google Form questionnaires were administered to employees and related stakeholders of the ICDN resort (see Appendices A and B), respectively. The questionnaire for F&B employees is more detailed and includes a greater number of questions to better understand their needs, lacks, and wants. Meanwhile, the questionnaire for related stakeholders is shorter and primarily focuses on their observations and perceptions of the needs, lacks, and wants of the F&B employees.

Each questionnaire consisted of three parts, i.e., demographic information, English needs and problems (seven questions for F&B employees and five questions for related stakeholders), and ESP course expectations (six questions for F&B employees and three questions for related stakeholders). In the drafting phase, the questionnaire items were constructed based on the official F&B employees’ job descriptions and the Standard Operating Procedures of restaurants at ICDN. Then, the two questionnaires were comprehensively reviewed by expert consultation to ensure face validity. Also, the two questionnaires were pilot-tested with two F&B employees and one related stakeholder of other 5-star resorts in Danang to predict the responding patterns of participants and make necessary changes for better data quality before distribution. Table 1 below details the number and type of questions in each session of the two questionnaires.

Table 1 Number and types of questions in two sets of questionnaires.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Sections</td><td>Questionnaire for F&amp;B Employees</td><td>Questionnaire for Related Stakeholders</td></tr><tr><td>1. Demographic information</td><td>8 questions (Multiple-choice &amp; Open ended)</td><td>4 questions (Multiple-choice &amp; Open ended)</td></tr><tr><td>2.

In addition, two sets of tailored interview questions were conducted online with five employees and nine stakeholders (seven major hotel colleagues and two hoteliers), respectively (see Appendices C and D). For the F&B employees, 12 semistructured interview questions were asked following a preset order; however, in some interviews, real-time questions were prompted following the conversation flow. As for the related stakeholders, eight questions were administered to seven major hotel colleagues. Extra thoughts and sharing were also warmly welcomed during the conversation. For the two hoteliers, open-ended interviews were conducted on English needs and English course expectations for F&B employees. All the interviews were organized individually through Zoom and Microsoft Teams for the convenience of recording and data analysis. Each of the interviews ranged from 20 to $3 0 ~ \mathrm { { m i n } }$ , with the language choice being either Vietnamese or English depending on the interviewees’ preferences and nationalities. After that, the Vietnamese interview scripts were translated into English for ease of coding during data analysis and for reporting as excerpts in the findings.

Lastly, a total of 333 reviews (in various languages) on Tripadvisor were examined to provide insights into guests’ perceptions of F&B employees’ English abilities and skills. This included 100 reviews from the Citron restaurant page (Citron Restaurant, n.d.), 100 reviews from the Barefoot restaurant page (Barefoot Restaurant, n.d.), and 133 reviews from the hotel page (Intercontinental Danang Sun Peninsula Resort, n.d.). Reviews for Citron and Barefoot restaurants were retrieved backward from May 2022 (the date of the data collection process) to January 2019 to cover all periods: before, during, and after the pandemic. Meanwhile, due to the large volume and the nature of the reviews focusing on the whole resort landscape and services, only reviews from March to May 2022 were collected on the hotel site as complementary data. It is noteworthy that within the framework of this research, which investigates guests’ views on the F&B employees’ English communication skills, the first author focused exclusively on 213 reviews written in English, Korean, Japanese, French, German, and other foreign languages. These reviews were selected as they reflect the actual communication context with guests in the English language.

# 3.3. Participants

In total, 56 participants were involved in this study, including F&B employees, major hotel colleagues, and hoteliers. Within the scope of this study, F&B employees referred specifically to rank-and-file staff working at restaurant outlets, excluding those at supervisory or managerial levels. Other employees within the F&B Department from supervisory positions and abovedincluding supervisors, Assistant Managers, Managers, and Directorsdwere considered related stakeholders. In further detail, 38 F&B employees and 16 related stakeholders completed the online questionnaires, among whom five employees and seven major hotel colleagues were invited to join semi-structured interviews. Additionally, two hoteliers were contacted to collect perspectives and expectations from key decision-makers for ESP course approval and implementation. Table 2 below summarizes the number of participants to online questionnaires and interviews.

Table 2 Participants to questionnaires and interviews.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Participants</td><td>Questionnaires</td><td>Interviews</td></tr><tr><td>F&amp;B Employees</td><td>38</td><td>5 (out of 38)</td></tr><tr><td>Hotel Colleagues</td><td>16</td><td>7 (out of 16)</td></tr><tr><td>Hoteliers</td><td>0</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td>56</td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

For questionnaire respondents, the F&B employees included 22 males and 16 females (average age of 24.3 years old) who hold different positions in the resort, such as waiter and waitress, hostess (welcoming guest), captain, and bartender. There was a good division of participation from five outlets, representing the actual service capacity and labour division at the resort. Approximately $4 7 \%$ of F&B employees had worked less than one year; $23 \%$ had worked in their position for 1 to 2 years, and the remainder $( 3 0 \% )$ had 3 to 5 years of working experience at ICDN. Regarding 16 related stakeholders, they were from the F&B team and seven other departments in frequent contact with the F&B employees, such as Club Intercontinental, Human Resources, Sales & Marketing, Quality Assurance, Guest Activity, Front Office, and Kitchen. Most related stakeholders $( 8 7 \% )$ had regular contact with F&B staff at the workplace. The average years of working experience of stakeholders was 5.7 years, with most participants working from 6 to 10 years at ICDN.

Regarding the interviewee’s demographic background, the initial code “E” was assigned to the F&B employees and “S” to the related stakeholders. All five F&B employees were male and worked at different positions and outlets within the resort. Three had less than one year of work experience, and the other two had worked for one year. Concerning related stakeholders, five were at the supervisory level and above from the F&B department; the remaining four interviewees were from other departments in the resort. Six were Vietnamese, and three were foreigners (Indian, Korean, Egyptian) representing the context of foreign managers and colleagues at ICDN. Most related stakeholders worked relatively long at ICDN (average 6.3 years), with the highest of 11 years and the lowest of 1 year. There was also a good mix of gender in the participants, with five males and four females. On a separate note, the “prolonged engagement” 1 of the first author with all the interviewees of this study allowed her to gain valuable insights into the employees’ and stakeholders’ perspectives.

# 3.4. Data analysis

Data were analysed in the following four stages. First, raw data collected from questionnaires were validated. After that, these two separate data sets were cautiously imported into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences program (IBM SPSS 28.0) for statistical analysis of means, standard deviations, and percentages for the close-ended items. In the meantime, data collected from open-ended items in the questionnaires were manually coded and categorized for further analysis following content analysis (Patton, 1990). In the second stage, the 14 semi-structured interviews were transcribed and then translated into English (if required) before being coded and categorized utilizing a thematic analysis approach (Braun & Clarke, 2006) to identify overarching categories of data across multiple participants. Categorized codes were first rated by the first author and then reviewed by the corresponding author; any ambiguities were discussed until unanimity. Also, a combination of letters (“E” for employee and “S” for related stakeholder) and numbers (1–9) was utilized to distinguish interviewees for anonymity and confidentiality purposes. The third stage involved selecting and analysing Tripadvisor reviews through content analysis and taxonomy to identify the frequency and relationships among salient review content. Finally, data collected from the member-checking process were analysed and integrated into the results. Member checking (also known as participant validation) is frequently utilized in qualitative research to achieve trustworthiness (Creswell & Miller, 2000). See Figure 1 for an overview of the relationships among research questions, data sources, and analytical methods.

Figure 1. Research questions in relation to data sources and data analysis methods.

# 4. Findings and discussion

This section presents the research findings by reporting data collected from F&B employees, followed by triangulation with data obtained from three additional sources: questionnaires and semi-structured interviews with related stakeholders, selective Tripadvisor reviews, and feedback from both F&B employees and related stakeholders through the member-checking process. Subsequently, the findings are discussed with those from previous studies to identify similarities and contribute new insights.

4.1. Research Questions 1: what tasks do F&B employees frequently perform in English in their workplace?

Responses to Item 11 in the staff questionnaire (i.e., how often do you perform the following tasks in English?) showed that the F&B employees had to use English to perform varied duties in the workplace, ranging from serving guests, making small talk, communicating with foreign managers and colleagues, solving guest’s complaints, reporting and responding to messages in group chats, answering telephone calls, writing reports and logbooks, attending meetings, sending emails to internal departments, sending emails to guests. Table 3 shows that among these tasks, the F&B employees used English most in serving guests $M = 4 . 1 1 \cdot$ ), making small talk with guests $M = 3 . 7 1$ ), and communicating with foreign managers and colleagues $M = 3 . 6 3$ ). Meanwhile, the task requiring English that they least performed was sending emails to guests $M = 2 . 9 7 $ .

Table 3 Tasks requiring English at work.

During semi-structured interviews, the employees also detailed some tasks requiring English, including writing daily guest satisfaction reports, ordering goods through emails, and completing corporate training on Merlin2 and related brand campaigns. In addition, the staff shared that at the time of the interview, IHG was launching a campaign called “IHG Wow stories,” in which employees were requested to write about events or incidents that amazed the guests and achieved high satisfaction. The following excerpts from employee interviews illustrate further.

At the end of the shift, we have to write a “guest satisfaction card” with information about guest’s profiles, their order, and their preference and allergies (if any) . [E3]

Then, there are training courses that must be completed using a Merlin account. [E5]

Triangulated data from major hotel colleagues’ questionnaires indicated that tasks that the employees frequently perform in English in the workplace include communication with foreign managers and colleagues, sending emails to internal departments, writing reports and logbooks, and serving guests. The related stakeholders were also aware that at rank-and-file levels, the employees were not required to send emails directly to guests, solve guests’ complaints by themselves, or attend meetings; therefore, these tasks received lower means.

Data from interviews with major hotel colleagues also revealed two additional reading tasks performed by the F&B employees that required English skills. One was related to reading comments or guest profiles in the Opera3 system with abbreviations specialized for Front Office, F&B, and Reservation. The other involved reading internal email communication. The stakeholders shared that in an international resort with many expatriate employees, all general email communications were in English, so all staff was expected to understand these written messages and memos.

Figure 2 summarizes the first research question with a detailed list of tasks requiring the four English skills. These skills were used daily and thus must account for an appropriate proportion of the syllabus. These results were similar to findings from previous research (Do & Cheng, 2021; Mahardika, 2018; Pongganta, 2019; Prima, 2022; Santoso, 2016; Siddiqui & Naz, 2016), emphasizing the frequent use of oral skills, i.e., speaking and listening in English communication of the F&B employees. Meanwhile, this study revealed new findings peculiar to F&B employees in a 5-star resort context, such as attending departmental briefings and meetings, writing guest satisfaction reports (recording guest profiles), writing internal email communication and messages, writing as part of the IHG brand campaigns, and reading as part of online brand training. In line with the high service standards and guests’ expectations in a 5-star resort, these tasks should receive adequate attention in the English training program to fulfil the specific needs of the F&B employees in this specific working environment.

4.2. Research Question 2: what problems do they perceive they encounter when using English at work?

The first problem facing the F&B employees in using English at work is the lack of confidence. Responding to Item 13 in the F&B employee’s questionnaire regarding the confidence level in using English at work, only $1 8 . 4 \%$ $\mathrm { [ n = 3 8 ] }$ ) of the participants felt very confident communicating in English. The rest, $80 \%$ , experienced a certain level of lack of confidence. Secondly, in terms of a specific challenging English skill facing the F&B employees, responses to Item 14 in the F&B employee questionnaires (Appendix A) demonstrated that staff perceived writing as the most difficult among four English skills $( M = 2 . 7 9 )$ ), followed by listening $M = 2 . 4 5$ ) and speaking $M = 2 . 3 7 _ { \cdot }$ ). Reading was considered the least problematic skill for F&B employees $M = 2 . 0 0$ ). See Table 4.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Skills</td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td></tr><tr><td>Writing</td><td>2.79</td><td>0.875</td></tr><tr><td>Listening</td><td>2.45</td><td>0.978</td></tr><tr><td> Speaking</td><td>2.37</td><td>0.819</td></tr><tr><td>Reading</td><td>2.00</td><td>0.900</td></tr></table></body></html>

Details from the interview data confirmed the results of the questionnaires. The staff found writing in English difficult as they were not competent at combining words into meaningful and grammatically correct sentences. Regarding listening skills, the staff admitted that some English accents are difficult to understand and that, unlike other skills that can be selfstudied, listening skills need daily practice for improvement. Difficulties while speaking English were conveyed through passive English communication and the struggle to maintain a long conversation in English with guests and managers. The lack of F&B terms, business English, and vocabulary for daily communication prevented the staff from speaking English fluently and establishing lively conservations. Regarding reading skills, the F&B employees said they faced challenges reading correspondence in group chats and training materials on the Merlin platform due to the lack of vocabulary. Extracts from interviews with E1 and E4 below illustrate further.

The problem is that each guest has their own way of pronunciation and accent. Also, I’m not good at listening, so when listening to foreigners, I don’t understand. I just can’t grasp what they mean. [E1]

I don’t know how to lead the story as I don’t have that big amount of vocabulary and I don’t know how to link the sentences to match the context. [E4]

From the related stakeholders’ perspectives, the biggest problems facing the F&B employees among four skills in descending sequence were listening, writing, speaking, and reading. Although there was a minor difference compared to the employee’s questionnaires in which writing skill was ranked first and listening skill second, both parties agreed that listening and writing were the most problematic skills for the F&B employees. Through interview questions with major hotel colleagues, it was also revealed that problems with employees’ English skills at the workplace were derived from the lack of English exposure over the past two years during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, during that challenging period, due to market availability, the resort was forced to recruit staff with limited English proficiency who were only capable of communicating with simple English words and sentences. As a result, when foreign guests started returning in the last months, the F&B staff experienced great difficulties communicating with them. The related stakeholders also highlighted the problems with the listening skills of the employees, including distinguished guest accents and staff’s self-assumptions of the guest requests instead of confirmation after listening. Regarding writing, the staff hesitated to write stories or reports because they lacked sufficient knowledge of vocabulary, grammar, and sentence structures.

In the interviews, the two hoteliers reiterated the challenges faced by the F&B employees, including low English proficiency, lack of confidence in communication, and negative attitudes toward learning English. Additionally, many employees were left unemployed during periods of closure and restructuring due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, upon the resort’s reopening, some had secured alternative livelihoods, posing challenges in recruiting new employees with strong English skills. Since the beginning of 2022 and the lifting of travel restrictions, foreign guests have returned to the resort. However, the management began receiving negative feedback on staff English proficiency, particularly in phone communication. Their remarks are detailed in the excerpt below.

The guests commented that the language has become bad, especially over the phone. That’s where we are mainly lacking. [S1]

Overall, the F&B employees and stakeholders concurred that the most significant challenges revolved around writing and listening skills. The five most difficult tasks identified included sending emails to guests, attending meetings, sending emails to internal departments, and making small talks with guests. The F&B employees also admitted their lack of confidence in English communication due to low English proficiency and insufficient F&B vocabulary. These findings shared similar features identified by previous findings such as Santoso (2016), Do & Cheng (2019), and Pongganta (2019), which revealed the problems in listening skills by virtue of unfamiliar accents and lack of vocabulary to express ideas. More importantly, in the past few years, the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tourism industry in general, and the hotel industry in particular, has led to a severe lack of exposure to English in the working environment. This finding is novel as the research was conducted right after the COVID-19 pandemic period in Vietnam when the country released its travel restrictions for about three months.

4.3. Research Question 3: how have they been trained in English skills prior to recruitment and on the job?

Results from the demographic section of the F&B employee questionnaires revealed the staff’s experience regarding prerecruitment and on-the-job English training. In particular, approximately $4 0 \%$ of the team $[ \boldsymbol { \mathrm { n } } = 3 8 ^ { \cdot }$ ) had been trained in English before their recruitment at the resort; meanwhile, the remaining $6 0 \%$ had never joined any official English training. As for onthe-job English training at the resort, only about $1 6 \%$ of the employees had participated in an English training course offered either by the F&B Department or the Human Resources Department.

Concerning English proficiency, $6 0 \%$ of the participants had taken standard English tests such as TOEIC,4 IELTS,5 and CEFR B1,6 while the rest had no similar experience. Looking further into these figures, among those possessing an official English proficiency test certificate, $5 6 \%$ had relatively high results, such as TOEIC 600 to 800, IELTS 6.5 or 7.5, while the rest achieved TOEIC 450 to 599.

In relation to pre-recruitment English training, the related stakeholders have voiced concerns over the insufficient English education provided to the staff during their college and university years, resulting in inadequate proficiency that fails to meet the job requirements. Regarding on-the-job training, interviews with related stakeholders revealed that English training was conducted for the F&B employees in 2019; however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, such training has been limited since then. At the time of the research, there was no ongoing English training program at the resort. Despite the absence of a formal course, the F&B employees were expected to engage in self-study to enhance their English skills during a two-month probationary period; failure to do so risked their continued employment.

In summary, concerning English training before recruitment, $4 0 \%$ $\mathrm { \dot { n } } = 3 8 \mathrm { \dot { 1 } }$ ) of participants joined English training at private centers, mainly in Communication English or TOEIC courses. They mentioned that English competence was considered a decisive factor during recruitment, as stated by Siddiqui and Naz (2016). Besides, following the resort policy, each F&B staff was required to pass a two-month probation period, by the end of which their English skills need recognizable improvement; otherwise, their employment would be terminated (similar to the new employees in the study conducted by Do and Cheng (2019)). As for the resort’s on-the-job English training, $1 6 \%$ of participants attended English training courses organized by the HR Department during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, during the semi-structured interviews, none of the F&B staff had joined the resort’s English training; thus, it was not possible to inquire about more training details. Regarding triangulated data, some major hotel colleagues stated that the resort’s English training still required significant improvement. Specifically, they noted concerns about placing learners of different levels in the same class, which caused discouragement and demotivation in learning. Also, as shared by the hoteliers, English training was not prioritized in the past three years due to the prevalence of local Vietnamese guests at the resort, where English communication is considered unnecessary. Consequently, opportunities for the F&B employees to improve their English skills through official English training were limited.

4.4. Research Question 4: what are their expectations of English training for professional development?

The last part of the employee’s questionnaire provided data related to the expectations of the F&B staff if there would be an ESP course specially designed for them. They specifically mentioned that they would like to enhance their speaking skill most $M = 3 . 3 7 \mathrm { \Omega }$ , followed by listening $M = 3 . 2 1 \AA$ ), writing $M = 3 . 0 8 { \mathrm { \Omega } }$ ), and reading $M = 2 . 8 4 )$ , as can be seen in Table 5. In terms of aspects to learn, most employees expressed a preference for the ESP course to emphasize additional F&B-related vocabulary and to improve their pronunciation and fluency in speaking. Grammar was identified as the least prioritized area for concentration.

Table 5 Skills staff wish to improve most.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Skills</td><td>Mean</td><td>SD</td></tr><tr><td> Speaking</td><td>3.37</td><td>0.942</td></tr><tr><td>Listening</td><td>3.21</td><td>0.991</td></tr><tr><td>Writing</td><td>3.08</td><td>0.997</td></tr><tr><td>Reading</td><td>2.84</td><td>1.027</td></tr></table></body></html>

Consistent with the questionnaire results, speaking and listening were also the skills that five interviewees wished to improve the most. They especially aspired to respond promptly and efficiently in conversations, as it took them a long time to think of ideas and vocabulary before answering. Also, F&B vocabulary enrichment, pronunciation, and fluency were necessary. In the interviews, the F&B employees also stated their wish to use more formal English in communication with guests as a requirement of working in a luxury resort.

I want to learn how to respond quickly in English because now I am very slow. Even guests have said something for a long time, I still cannot respond. [E1]

Although we are not native English speakers, at least we need to learn to pronounce correctly so that guests recognize the words and understand what we say. [E3]

In addition, according to data collected from Item 18 of the employee questionnaire, $7 6 \%$ of the F&B employees expected the ESP course to be specifically centered on English for F&B-related communication, $2 1 \%$ wanted to study English for daily communication, and $3 \%$ chose both areas. Regarding the location and mode of training, most employees preferred to attend an offline course at the resort training venue for convenient transportation and time management. They also stated that offline training would be more effective thanks to the direct interaction between the instructor and learners. Other quantitative results from the questionnaires indicated that most employees preferred ESP training to be organized twice a week within three months, with about 10–20 students in a class. Regarding the final item of the F&B employee questionnaire, participants provided recommendations for the course, highlighting a preference for a foreign English teacher, easy accessibility of the course for all interested employees, and the importance of a systematic curriculum.

Furthermore, in the interviews, the staff expressed their expectations for an ESP course with many mini-games, role plays of actual situations, and group work. The teaching contents could focus on practical knowledge for the staff to apply immediately after returning to their outlets, such as steps/procedures to handle guests’ complaints or topics in real-life conversation. Concerning course planning, there should be continuity of the courses, which means staff finishing one level could move to the next. Also, it was suggested that the English teacher should have an F&B background or at least an understanding of F&B operations for better teaching and learning quality.

Data from related stakeholders’ questionnaires shared the exact pattern with those from the employees regarding skills that F&B staff needed to improve most, namely speaking and listening skills. Moreover, in the interviews, they recommended that an ESP course for F&B employees should focus on practicing and enhancing staff’s confidence in speaking English for basic tasks such as taking orders, serving guests, providing guests with precise information, receiving complaints, and reporting to a higher level for handling, picking up the phone in the brand standards, and others. In addition, the related stakeholders hoped the course would provide practical knowledge (personalized to individual restaurants) and immediate workplace practice opportunities. Some related stakeholders also reported that in the past, English training provided by the Human Resource Team was somewhat ineffective to some staff because the class mixed learners with different proficiency levels. Thus, it is suggested that before any ESP course, a placement test is organized to identify and arrange learners into classes corresponding to their English proficiency levels. Finally, besides training in English skills, raising staff’s awareness of the importance of English and inspiring them to lifelong learning is critical for their continued improvement.

From policymakers’ perspectives, the two hoteliers clearly expressed their expectations of an ESP course. First, there was no need for professional writing skills or grammar knowledge. The course should emphasize speaking and listening skills, prioritizing prompt and professional responses to guests in formal language appropriate to the luxury level of the resort. Additionally, the staff must enhance their pronunciation and conversational aspects, such as building and maintaining a comfortable conversation with the guests. Also, the training content should incorporate product knowledge, travel recommendations, and locality destinations. F&B vocabulary and terms should be provided in the format of collaterals of handbooks for ease of reference. In addition, audio and visual aids, such as movie clips, YouTube videos, games, and other technologyenhanced language learning tools and techniques, are recommended for the active in-class participation of the learners. The hoteliers also showed commitment to supporting the English training program and ensuring the staff attendance for their English improvement.

They need to have basic knowledge about how to build a conversation and the confidence of our team is very low when it comes to speaking English. [S1]

So, we have to create a nice reward or recognizing program in order to really uplift their spirits and encourage them to join the training program. [S9]

Overall, the consensus among all involved parties was an ESP course for F&B employees prioritizing speaking and listening skills. It was also agreed that writing and reading skills should not be neglected, especially for advanced learners aspiring to higher positions with more complicated English-related tasks. The F&B staff also need English training to gain more confidence in interacting with the guests, as mentioned by the Director of the F&B Department: “ .. speaking in Vietnamese, staff can sell the whole world, so the language is just a barrier for them to communicate.” Similarly, Lichtenstein-Hershman (2019) and Tipan (2021) emphasized the importance of training in strengthening employees’ confidence and reducing their anxieties about English communication. Regarding contents, the F&B employees expect to study a practical syllabus customized to each restaurant outlet’s service journey and uniqueness, integrating product knowledge and local stories. For classroom activities, they preferred interactive tasks such as games, role-play, group discussions, technology-assisted activities, and ample practice opportunities. These activities align with the collaborative learning approach in ESP discussed by Astawa and Ardiasa (2022), which emphasizes “learning by doing” and “working in a group” to enhance learning outcomes. Also, expectations of course materials and in-class activities for an ESP course in this study are comparable to that of Nova (2021), in which a combination of audio and visual aids and videos are more attractive and understandable, thus supporting the learners’ skills enhancement and fostering learners’ motivation. Besides, similar to the findings of Pongganta (2019), the F&B employees would rather have English training conducted in the hotel after working hours for their ease of participation. Notably, the F&B employees and related stakeholders mentioned on many occasions the need for formal and elegant language in communication as the resort situated itself at the top of the luxury resort category in Vietnam. This specialized feature and requirement in the hospitality industry must also be reflected in the syllabus to address the needs of specific learners and interested parties.

# 4.5. Triangulated data from Tripadvisor reviews

An analysis of collected Tripadvisor reviews showed that there were four comments (two positive and two negative) related to the English abilities as stated below.

There was a happening on the way, but the staff were really kind, and I was able to spend it without any problems! I am especially grateful to VY who speaks English fluently. [Reviewed by EL in January 2020, on Citron Restaurant’s Tripadvisor site.]

Oanh, who was serving us, portrayed exemplary customer service skills and walked us through everything about the menu, along with continuing an amazing [English] conservation with my family. [Reviewed by Gi in January 2020, on Barefoot Restaurant’s Tripadvisor site.]

.E-mail reservations are also handled very carefully, so even people who are not good at English are okay. [Reviewed by J2 in December 2019, on Citron Restaurant’s Tripadvisor site.]

Staff and service are lacking warmth and basic [English] communication and hospitality skills across the board. Mistakes when ordering food and drinks. [Reviewed by Be in April 2021 on the resort’s Tripadvisor site.]

Interestingly, a repetitive review pattern showed the relationship between guest satisfaction and the F&B service provided. It appears that the guests highly appreciated and recognized the staff by names on Tripadvisor reviews when they experienced the following personalized services: clear menu explanation; storytelling of Vietnamese food and coffee, local stories, and knowledge; travel advice and recommendations; introduction of hotel facilities and surrounding areas, recognitions of guests’ allergies and preference; and chit chat and small talks. These services definitely demand high English competence and communication skills from the F&B employees.

.I am very glad to see Hue, who was my server. She was very nice when she explained to me the story of Vietnamese coffee and show me how to enjoy it. [Reviewed by Re in June 2020, on Citron Restaurant’s Tripadvisor site.]

The service was great. Rustic: you did a great job! Always time for a “small talk” and an explanation, fine advice on the wine.. [Reviewed by PB in October 2019, on Barefoot Restaurant’s Tripadvisor site.]

On a different note, some reviews confirmed the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the overall resort service, which propounded the urgent need for F&B employee training in both professional and language skills to resume the preCOVID level.

I would be honest that the resort is facing issues getting back to its pre-COVID service levels due to a combination of factors. [Reviewed by As, in May 2022, on the resort’s Tripadvisor site.]

In short, an analysis of Tripadvisor reviews from the resort’s and two restaurants’ Tripadvisor sites revealed mixed perceptions of the guests towards the F&B employees’ English skills, with compliments and complaints about their language skills. More importantly, reviews from these sites implied that the guests sincerely appreciated the locally integrated services provided by the staff, leaving them with a great impression of the resort service and the local culture. As a result, these components should be integrated into the English training content to enhance guests’ satisfaction. Finally, Tripadvisor reviews showed that the impact of COVID-19 on the resort service was undeniable; thus, the urgent implementation of training on professional and English skills was more indispensable than ever.

# 4.6. Results from member checking

To validate the research results and as part of the participant role triangulation, the employees and related stakeholders were asked to share their opinions on the research findings. The member-checking process was conducted in early December 2022 with the participation of three employees and two related stakeholders. Overall, all employees and stakeholders highly valued the research, agreed with the findings, and provided constructive feedback for the researchers to reflect on the overall research results and recommendations for the suggested syllabi. See the excerpts from the email and message feedback below.

I would add telephone etiquette and order-taking process, especially in IRD if possible, for our action plan. [S9]

Totally agree. Our F&B colleagues really need to improve their English (speaking and listening skills are the focus), experience in different accents, and gain confidence while communicating. [S7]

# 5. Pedagogical implications

Drawing on the study results and discussions with previous literature, some pedagogical implications are identified as follows. First, there is an urgent need for ESP training for the F&B employees at ICDN following the pandemic. The COVID19 crisis, with its concomitant cross-border travel restrictions, has led to limited exposure to an English-speaking working environment and recruitment of staff with low English proficiency at ICDN. When operations started resuming the pre-COVID period with increasing arrivals of international guests to the resort, the F&B employees needed to be trained and re-trained to regain and continuously improve their English skills to meet the high expectations of guests in a luxury resort. The research results indicate that an English needs analysis in particular and training needs analysis in general are critical after any pandemic that causes service suspensions because novel needs may arise, and existing needs may require adaptation. This practice also aligns with the recommendation of Johns and Price-Machada (2001) that NA should be considered a continuous process to accommodate the learners’ needs and expectations during a specific period.

Second, concerning course contents and methodology, an English training program should be tailored to accommo date the varying levels of English proficiency among employees. Priority should be given to enhancing speaking and listening skills for staff at the pre-intermediate level. Meanwhile, employees at intermediate level and above could focus on developing writing skills and achieving higher levels of conversational proficiency, as detailed in Appendices E and F. In further detail, the daily operations and features of each restaurant outlet, the resort’s product knowledge, and local stories must be adapted into the syllabus for immediate practice opportunities. Regarding methodology, the training program should be designed with interactive and cooperative activities (role-plays, on-site simulations, group discussions and presentations, and other real-life situations), integrating modern technology-enhanced learning tools and techniques (videos, podcasts, educational games, apps, etc.), especially in the era when most F&B employees seem to be digital natives.

Third, the concerns from the related stakeholders indicate that the ESP course should not be limited to teaching language and skills. Instead, the ESP teacher must be able to foster learning motivation and encourage the students in their English learning journey. Moreover, based on the interviews with major hotel colleagues, the ESP course can invite F&B Supervisors and Managers to share their stories of English learning. In so doing, it is hoped that they can serve as role models for F&B employees to enhance learning motivation and commitment to using English in the workplace.

Also, as part of the motivation-strengthening process, a certificate of completion or any kind of recognition from the resort, such as award points, could be given to those who successfully completed the English Course. In this way, learners are more motivated to learn and aim to achieve higher in their English skills, as mentioned by Hutchinson and Waters (1987):

.if your students are not fired with burning enthusiasm by the obvious relevance of their ESP materials, remember that they are not machines. The medicine of relevance may still need to be sweetened with the sugar of enjoyment, fun, creativity, and sense of achievement. (pp. 47–48)

Finally, similar to an academic context, in an occupational setting such as hotels or companies, it is critical to be aware of and accommodate the expectations of the decision-makers in an ESP program. In this 5-star resort context, perspectives from the hoteliers (General Manager and Director of F&B) should be cautiously addressed. In particular, formal and courteous use of the English language must be an integral part of the training program, following the luxury positioning of the resort in the hospitality industry. Also, F&B-related vocabulary and those for efficient daily communication should be included in the training program.

# 6. Conclusions and suggestions for further studies

In conclusion, this research investigated the English needs and problems faced by the F&B employees in a 5-star resort in Vietnam. This study utilized a case study approach, adopting a methodological checklist including various sources, methods and triangulation. Data sources included questionnaires, semi-structured interviews with F&B employees and related stakeholders, guest reviews analysis, and member checking. The results revealed that the F&B employees engaged in diverse tasks necessitating proficiency in all the four English language skills in their everyday work. Concerning challenges, listening and writing were regarded as the most difficult skills. Additionally, the F&B employees emphasized the need for an ESP course focusing on speaking and listening skills to address the reduced English exposure resulted by the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated travel restrictions. Drawing on these findings, ESP course planners and designers should integrate the stated needs, problems, and expectations of the F&B employees and all concerned parties to ensure successful course implementation.

Due to the pandemic, some limitations are identified, and corresponding recommendations are suggested for future research. First, during 2022, the first author was studying abroad in Taiwan; thus, on-site observations were not performed to explore the F&B staff’s performance in the target situation. Therefore, future researchers on similar topics should add data observed while the F&B employees are interacting with guests and other stakeholders, as well as interview resort guests for a comprehensive insight into the situation. Second, future research is recommended to conduct actual English training to evaluate whether the syllabi match related needs and if any further amendments are required. Third, the current study only focuses on exploring the tasks and skills needed for F&B employees in their English communication without surveying the accommodation strategies they utilized. In restaurant and hotel contexts where English serves as a common language, these communicative strategies are crucial in the employees’ daily communication. Therefore, it is suggested that future research explore these strategies to integrate into the English training program.
