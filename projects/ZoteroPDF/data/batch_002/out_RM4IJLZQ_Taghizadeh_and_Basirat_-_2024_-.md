# ABSTRACT

Since teachers are the most responsible ones for integrating technology into their online teaching practices, understanding their attitudes and beliefs is of great importance. This study thus investigated pre-service English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers’ attitudes and perceived challenges of teaching online language courses. To this end, a questionnaire with three categories on teachers’ values and attitudes, beliefs, and communication self-efficacy and one on perceived online teaching challenges with five categories of attitudinal, pedagogical, interactional, supportive, and technical were administered to 100 MA students of Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) at Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST). Five open-ended questions were also administered to gain more insight into their attitudes and perceived challenges of online teaching. The results indicated that pre-service teachers were interested in online teaching and believed that online teaching could help learners develop their English language knowledge, and that the advances in online information technologies could provide great opportunities for language teaching and learning. The results also revealed that categories on the attitude scale were ranked as communication self-efficacy, teachers’ values and attitudes, and their beliefs. Considering perceived challenges of online teaching, Internet connection, lack of teacher professional development courses for effective online teaching, and lack of previous online learning experiences were found to be the most frequent challenges. The dimensions of challenges were hierarchically ranked as technical, pedagogical, interactional, supportive, and attitudinal. The findings could shed light into designing and developing professional development courses for student teachers who are willing to teach online language courses.

# Introduction

Online education has been considered the integration of the Internet and highly developed multi-media technologies into teaching/learning processes to promote learning quality (Alshamrani, 2019; Bowers & Kumar, 2015). The emergence of the Internet, as Carnevale (2004) notes, has significantly brought about changes in the educational technologies and the ever-growing state of online education, including the field of language teaching. The Internet improves the chance of delivering language teaching with lower cost, providing opportunities for language institutes or universities of higher education to offer online courses (Godwin-Jones, 2003). In addition, the advancement in communication and information technologies makes online teaching more feasible economically, operationally, and technologically (Palvia et  al., 2018). However, effective online language teaching, according to Compton (2009), requires qualified academic staff with distinctive abilities and skills.

To be capable of teaching effectively in online classes, according to Hampel and Stickler (2005), online language teachers constantly need to be aware of their teaching beliefs and challenges. Furthermore, due to the shift from face-to-face (F2F) to online teaching, teachers need to reconstruct and reconsider their beliefs and attitudes (Baran & Correia, 2014). It is argued that teachers’ personal and pedagogical beliefs widely contribute to success and effective incorporation of technology into classrooms (Ertmer et  al., 2012; Levin & Wadmany, 2008). According to Wang (2002), the perceptions and beliefs of pre-service teachers are considered a significant part of constructing their future behavior in online teaching and technology integration. In addition, communication self-efficacy (i.e. teachers’ technology use to communicate with learners) is a crucial predictor of surmounting the weakness of online communication (Hung, 2016). Therefore, as a critical part of the instruction, teacher educators need to be accounted for building up positive beliefs in prospective teachers or modifying their beliefs in order to prepare them to incorporate technology into their online practices more successfully (Polly et  al., 2010; Tondeur et  al., 2012). In other words, since the main predictors of pre-service teachers’ future technology use are their beliefs and self-efficacy, identifying and developing their beliefs are crucial in teacher preparation programs (Anderson & Maninger, 2007).

Additionally, given the transition to online education, pre-service EFL teachers encounter new challenges of online teaching (Chahkandi, 2021). This transition also leads to pedagogical challenges, such as inadequate awareness of online language teacher roles and responsibilities; online teaching skills; learning patterns, styles, and approaches; and learning behavior (Sun, 2011). To integrate technology into their online teaching, pre-service teachers reported some challenges, including lack of technological opportunities, resources, and experienced educators (Aslan & Zhu, 2016). Lack of skills for Information and Communications Technology (ICT) and lack of experience are also found as other barriers pre-service teachers may encounter while implementing technology (Aslan & Zhu, 2015). ChahKandi (2021) found that EFL teachers become overwhelmed and overworked with the technical issues related to online language education. Therefore, given the importance of challenges of effective use of technology in language courses, identifying pre-service teachers’ perceived challenges is of great significance for policymakers of online teacher professional development programs.

# Theoretical framework

Pre-service teachers’ willingness to incorporate technology into their classroom is considered the first contributor to success in technology integration (Christensen & Knezek, 2008, 2009), and their willingness is conceptually interpreted as beliefs in and attitudes toward technology use in education (Knezek & Christensen, 2016). It is believed that both attitudes and beliefs are considered significant elements as they can influence the extent to which prospective teachers would incorporate technology into their future career (Anderson & Maninger, 2007; Ertmer et  al., 2012; Huang & Liaw, 2005; Marshall & Cox, 2008; Meelissen, 2008; Ottenbreit-Leftwich et  al., 2010; Prestridge, 2012; Yilmaz & Alici, 2011). For example, Manegre and Sabiri (2020) found that EFL teachers believe that online English language teaching can lead to a more positive teaching environment both for students and teachers, helping develop knowledge and ease of technology use. However, as stated by Wilson and Stacey (2004), teachers do not perceive change similarly, and some would be more reluctant to implement technology in their teaching. Teachers who are likely to implement technology in their classrooms are the ones with learner-centered and constructivist beliefs, which are beyond the scope of discussion in this article.

Online communication self-efficacy is defined as one of the components of teachers’ attitudes in this study, which refers to the extent to which an individual is aware of language of communication and communication culture specific to online learning environments as well as the extent to which individuals are capable of expressing themselves in such environments (Demir, 2015). According to Wei and Chou (2020), teachers’ online communication self-efficacy refers to their ability to guide and encourage learners to participate extensively in online courses, to respond to their posted questions and messages, and to give them effective, immediate feedback. Dorsah (2021) also notes that online communication self-efficacy, which is associated with computer-mediated communication, is among the crucial elements affecting pre-service teachers’ readiness for online teaching. It is thus important to assess teachers’ communication self-efficacy to tackle limitations of online communication (Hung, 2016).

It is found that teachers show hesitation about the transition from traditional teaching to online teaching because of their concerns about lack of planning time, lack of technical support and education, and losing control of the curriculum and autonomy (Allen & Seaman, 2007; Keengwe & Kidd, 2010). Given online teachers’ viewpoints, teaching online courses are conceived to be more demanding compared to F2F ones (Gerlich, 2005). The considerable amount of effort and time required to learn the new technological tools and to design online courses is the reason given for teachers’ frustration (Brogden & Couros, 2002; Grosse, 2004). Some teachers, as Matsom (2006) notes, are found resistant to teaching online courses because they assume that online courses need more time for planning. Teachers also complain that due to the excessive time needed to check and grade students’ activities and to answer their online questions, teaching online courses is labor intensive (Sellani & Harrington, 2002; Wegmann & McCauley, 2008).

Nelson and Thompson (2005) suggest several barriers to online teaching practices, which are workload, lack of administrative support, faculty time, rewards, course quality, cost, equipment, and learner contacts. Bailey and Card (2009) pinpoint that an online class generally lacks non-verbal communication clues, such as body language and tone of voice. They also highlight that the main concerns of online teachers are accessible online learning platform, system delays, and e-mail reliability. It is also argued that employing online education brings about several barriers of which previous online learning experience and lack of teacher education are considered the two main factors, affecting the adoption of online teaching (Mahdizadeh et  al., 2008). It is similarly stated that courses on technology are offered by trainers with insufficient knowledge due to insufficient instructional opportunities (Garrett, 2009; Hanson-Smith, 2016; Kessler, 2006; Lambert & Gong, 2010).

Teachers’ challenges, according to Nkonge and Gueldenzolph (2006), include Internet connections, inadequate hardware and software, learners’ inactivity and delay, learners’ inadequate guidance, shortage of time to design and develop courses, and inadequate technical expertise. Having considered teachers’ technological challenges, Adedoyin and Soykan (2020) argue that since online learning is highly dependent on the Internet facilities and technological devices, learners and instructors with poor Internet connections and poor provision of devices tend to be frustrated with online education. Reviewing the barriers to teacher education programs, Hubbard (2008) also lists teachers’ challenges as the trouble with the change in teaching methods, inadequate technological standards for language teaching, inadequate time to implement CALL, lack of awareness about the accessible options to integrate technology, insufficient infrastructure causing limited access to technology, lack of straightforward methodology to effective technology use, and unavailability of knowledgeable and experienced educators in the domain of technology education.

# Research synthesis

Previous studies have highlighted the significance of teachers’ attitudes toward technology integration into online courses. For instance, having conducted a series of semi-structured interview with eight student teachers aimed at finding the factors affecting their preparation to employ ICT in their classrooms, Gill and Dalgarno (2008) found that among all factors, including ability to use ICT, perceived usefulness, ease of use, and benefits, pre-service teachers’ positive beliefs and attitudes could significantly influence their preparedness to use ICT in their future career. Kavanoz et  al. (2015) also conducted a survey study to investigate pre-service EFL teachers’ views about their self-efficacy for Web Pedagogical Content Knowledge (W-PCK). At a state university in Turkey, 113 pre-service teachers were asked to fill out a 30-item questionnaire. The results revealed that pre-service teachers had positive attitudes toward web-based instruction, and their ability and inclination led to successful technology incorporation into their courses. In another study, Canals and Al-Rawashdeh (2018) investigated an online English course from the perspectives of 10 instructors. Canals and Al-Rawashdeh found that although teacher preparation was essential prior to the course, teachers reported inconsistent attitudes toward the integration of technology into language teaching courses. To lead prospective teachers to integrate technologies into their teaching and to explore their attitudes toward such integration into a practicum experience lasted for 12 weeks, Gönen (2019) conducted a study with eight pre-service teachers of TEFL in Turkey. Given the findings, Gönen concluded that although pre-service teachers had some concerns for technology integration, they expressed positive attitudes toward this integration. Similarly, as Raygan and Moradkhani (2020) concluded from their study on 209 Iranian EFL teachers, efficient technology integration mainly needs EFL teachers to maintain positive attitudes toward technological advancement influenced by fostering their motivation for technology use.

The effectiveness of preparation courses offered to prospective teachers is essential to encourage them to use technology in their online classes.

For instance, Kessler (2006) investigated the extent of teachers’ satisfaction with preparation for CALL using a survey with 32 items. The participants were $2 4 0 \mathrm { M A }$ graduates of Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), who were also considered pre-service teachers. The results showed a general dissatisfaction with CALL education. They also held the view that preparation for CALL in their MA programs was ineffective, and that the instruction was mostly related to enhancing digital literacy rather than using technological tools for language teaching. Kessler concluded that although CALL was regarded as a constituent of language teaching programs, it was not sufficiently backed up by most teacher education programs. It is similarly found that online teachers emphasized their need for more technical and instructional support, since they were not satisfied with the amount of existing education, technical assistance, and the quality of their online courses (Allen & Seaman, 2007; Keengwe et  al., 2008).

Given the importance of preparation courses, EFL pre-service teachers’ attitudes and beliefs about teacher education programs offered to them have been investigated in a number of studies. For example, Turkmen et  al. (2007) explored the perceptions of 34 Turkish pre-service teachers about their preparation programs to use technology. Turkmen et  al. found that the pre-service teachers were relatively not familiar with the benefits of educational technologies and consequently did not enormously use them. Koc and Bakir (2010) conducted a needs analysis study to explore the background knowledge and perceptions of 26 pre-service teachers about their preparation for technology integration. The results of their study showed that pre-service teachers believed that they did not receive adequate support and were not sufficiently educated for technology integration. Aydin (2013) investigated 157 Turkish EFL teachers’ perceptions and their school climate and support for technology use in learning and teaching. Aydin found that EFL teachers had positive perceptions of computer integration, although they suffered from the lack of instructional and technical support. In line with Hedayati and Marandi (2014) findings, indicating that lack of effective language teacher professional development could not lead to technology use by teachers, Comas-Quinn (2011) states that language teachers’ positive attitudes toward online teaching may be reached by effective teacher education.

The challenges teachers may face in teaching and developing online courses have also been the focus of previous studies. For example, having administered a questionnaire among 20 language teachers and interviewed three teachers, Comas-Quinn (2011) determined three main classifications of teachers’ concerns: lack of time (e.g. learning/teaching being distributed with too many places to check), lack of integration (e.g. poor integration of tools into courses and optional activities for assessment), and technical issues (e.g. problems regarding reliability and robustness of tools). Gönen (2019) interviewed eight Turkish pre-service teachers about challenges of a program on English language teaching. Gönen identified technical difficulties, such as poor sound and visual qualities and Internet connection as the challenges of integrating technology, which could distract students from taking part in activities and diminish the positive learning atmosphere.

Given the primary aim of their study to improve pre-service teacher education program in terms of technology use and to help them fill the gap of practice and academic preparation, Smith and Greene (2013) investigated the challenges pre-service teachers experienced during the online learning practicum. Smith and Greene found two main challenges, including the need to boost pre-service teachers’ technical competency and assist them to come to a better understanding of how to use online learning technologies more effectively. Some other barriers have also been identified, hindering the integration of technology into online classes. For example, Hedayati and Marandi (2014) determined the barriers a number of EFL teachers attributed to incorporating CALL into their classes through applying a survey among 100 EFL teachers and interviewing 12 ones. The participants were both pre-service and in-service teachers with and without experience of technology integration. Hedayati and Marandi concluded that EFL teachers did not tend to incorporate technology into their courses due to several barriers classified into three main domains of learner, teacher, and facility constraints among which teacher constraints due to the lack of teacher preparation played a distinguishing role. In another study, Aslan and Zhu (2016) distributed two questionnaires among 599 pre-service teachers in various subjects, such as social science, Turkish language, science, and elementary mathematics and found that to integrate technology, pre-service teachers encountered external barriers, including lack of accessibility to various software and computers, inadequate time for planning instructions, and insufficient administrative and technical support.

To explore Iranian pre-service EFL teachers’ obstacles in technology use in their classes, Fathi and Ebadi (2020) conducted a qualitative study with six pre-service EFL teachers in a teacher education course on CALL. After the course, the participants were asked to teach a class for seven weeks. Given the findings, Fathi and Ebadi categorized the obstacles as (a) facility conditions: their inadequate technical support and equipment access and (b) transfer failure: their incapability to transfer their experience with CALL to their classes due to their insufficient confidence and competence. Given the studies reviewed on challenges of online teaching, the researchers of this study classified the challenges into attitudinal, pedagogical, interactional, supportive, and technical and explored EFL student teachers’ views of these challenges. In sum, the COVID-19 situation was the main reason for conducting this study, which investigated possible new beliefs and attitudes and identified more challenges of EFL teachers.

# Overview of this study

Nowadays, due to the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the worldwide teaching/learning trend has shifted toward online education, which has become the only current delivery mode encouraging a large number of English language institutes to offer online courses, and Iran is no exception. In addition to teaching F2F classes, online campuses implicitly encourage language teachers to be capable of teaching online courses. Nevertheless, in the TEFL program in higher education, Iranian pre-service teachers mostly learn about theoretical and practical aspects related to F2F English language classes, and only few courses have been offered to educate them for online teaching. Furthermore, as numerous institutes have been growing to offer online language courses to a diverse student population due to the pandemic, pre-service teachers feel the need for getting more familiar with the new teaching trend. This migration to online education, as Ribeiro (2020) notes, has led to inevitable attitudinal modification and logistical challenges of learners, instructors, and education administrators, which are also considered the rationale for focusing on both teachers’ attitudes and challenges of online teaching and designing two questionnaires in this study. Thus, apart from pre-service teachers’ awareness of the significance of online education, their attitudes and beliefs are also important, since maintaining positive attitudes and beliefs in technology integration and being aware of the challenges of such integration result in their better performance, which can ultimately help promote learning experience (Duncan & Barnett, 2009; Pérez-Paredes et  al., 2018) and collaborative learning (Lambert & Cuper, 2009). Although there have been some studies (e.g. Canals & Al-Rawashdeh, 2018; Gönen, 2019; Liu et  al., 2017) investigating teachers’ attitudes and beliefs in EFL contexts, research on the attitudes and challenges perceived by a group of Iranian pre-service language teachers experiencing the worldwide challenges of online education due to the pandemic may provide more insights into educating them for online teaching. This study thus aimed to investigate EFL student teachers’ attitudes and perceived challenges of teaching online language courses. Accordingly, the following two questions were addressed:

1. What are pre-service Iranian EFL teachers’ attitudes toward teaching online English language courses?   
2. What challenges do Iranian EFL teachers encounter while teaching online English language courses?

# Method

Due to the rapid turnaround in the data collection, the economy of the design, and the advantages of survey design, a web-based survey research was used. In other words, influenced mainly by the aims of the study, both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. The research tool for collecting quantitative data was questionnaires, while that for collecting qualitative data was open-ended questions administered online to EFL student teachers to gain a deeper understanding of their concerns about the same issues. Specifically, the purpose was to explore their attitudes and perceived challenges of online teaching.

# Participants

The participants were $1 0 0 \mathrm { M A }$ students of TEFL at IUST. They were 77 female $( 7 7 \% )$ and 23 male $( 2 3 \% )$ student teachers with the age range of 23–50 years old (mean age $= 3 0$ ). Sixty of the participants were TEFL students at the e-learning campus of the university, while 40 of whom were studying TEFL in the F2F classes. It is worth noting that all the participants, both from the e-learning campus and the F2F classes, had attended the CALL course offered by a visiting professor from Amirkabir University of Technology. During this course, the student teachers had merely become familiar with some software and tools theoretically rather than practicing their implementation in online language classes.

Convenience or opportunity sampling, according to Cohen et  al. (2018), entails choosing the nearest individuals to whom researchers have easy access as respondents; and students or student teachers are often considered the respondents of this type of sampling, which is also used for case studies. Despite the negligible generalizability of this type of sampling, a convenience sample was selected, since a good number of student teachers with no online teaching experience both in the F2F and online classes were available at that time to survey, were in the researchers’ institutions, and the first researcher was offering them some courses. In other words, the first researcher had access to them F2F or via social network sites, including WhatsApp and Telegram to explain the purpose and the process of the study. Another reason for choosing the sample only from the IUST was related to the fact that this university was a pioneer in offering MA program of TEFL both online and F2F, and that students with higher ranks at the entrance examination were accepted to study at this university. The key principles followed for ethical procedures included minimization of harm, respecting participants’ autonomy through informed consent, and protecting their privacy through addressing anonymity and confidentiality. They were thus informed that they could participate in the study voluntarily and anonymously, emphasizing the importance of their participation and sincere responses. Moreover, they were assured that their responses would be kept confidential and be used only for the research purposes.

# Instruments

To obtain the required data, two questionnaires (i.e. online teacher attitudes and perceived challenges of online teaching) coupled with five open-ended questions were administered (Appendices A & B). The questionnaire on online teacher attitudes was aimed to determine student teachers’ opinions of teaching online language courses. This scale comprised 32 items classified into three categories of teachers’ values and attitudes toward online teaching (17 items) developed by Uzunboylu (2007), teachers’ online teaching beliefs (11 items) developed by Canals and Al-Rawashdeh (2018), and teachers’ online communication self-efficacy (4 items) developed by Hung (2016). It is stated that open-ended items can give valuable and new answers, which may not be considered by the researchers before (Gurel et  al., 2015), and that they often provide more reliable and valid responses than closed items (Krosnick & Presser, 2010). It is also argued that open-ended questions can help researchers elicit unique and personal views from the respondents and may raise unanticipated issues not included in the questionnaire. Hence, instead of asking the respondents to just tick some options, to invite more personal views about online teaching, four open-ended questions related to attitudes were developed to explore the pre-service teachers’ attitudes and interest in teaching online language courses, their views of the significance of online teaching in language development, their self-efficacy for online teaching, and their evaluation of the instructional courses they received on online teaching, which were in line with the three dimensions and the items of the questionnaire. In addition, to obtain a snapshot of the perceived challenges EFL teachers may encounter in teaching online language courses, the perceived online teaching challenges scale was used. This questionnaire with 22 items was developed by the researchers after reviewing the literature. To further explore and to enhance richness and depth of views on challenges of online English language teaching, an opened-ended question on perceived challenges of online teaching was added.

# Procedure

This study was conducted in the second semester of the 2019 academic year at IUST with $1 0 0 \mathrm { M A }$ students of TEFL. Having used Likert scale questionnaires, the researchers considered the epistemological foundations of the Likert scale questionnaire (i.e. adherence to the principles of unidimensionality and univocity, the semantic orientation of the items, and the reliability procedures), which are explained in different sections of the procedure. Attitude, according to Isakson et  al. (2016), is a multi-dimensional factor consisting of behavioral, cognitive, and affective aspects. Reviewing the literature on dimensions of attitudes toward online teaching, self-efficacy, belief, and value were found significant. Hence, three categories of value, belief, and self-efficacy were considered for the first scale in a five-point Likert scale ( $1 \ =$ strongly disagree, $2 =$ disagree, $3 =$ neutral, $4 =$ agree, and $5 \ : =$ strongly agree). The items of the questionnaires used in this study were not semantically reworded; in other words, the researchers used the exact wordings of the items as they appeared in the original questionnaires. Furthermore, four open-ended questions were added to the scale to get more insight into the opinions of pre-service EFL teachers about teaching online language courses. Having reviewed the literature to find the main themes for the perceived challenges of teaching online language courses, the online teaching challenges scale along with an open-ended question was also developed. It is worth noting that the content validity of the open-ended items was conducted, and two experts in online teaching were asked to evaluate the content of the items. To be specific, accuracy and clarity of the words of items were reviewed by two experts in online teaching and were found relevant and appropriate to explore student teachers’ attitudes and perceived challenges of online teaching.

Internet-based survey method was used to collect the required data. In other words, to improve the reliability and quality of the data and to control the number of those who opened it, as suggested by Ramo and Prochaska (2012), social media sites were used to deliver the survey. In addition, to enhance the quality of the data obtained, the researchers informed the pre-service teachers of the significance of their accurate responses to the items of the survey. Before they were used with actual participants and to evaluate the management, resources, and feasibility of the steps of the study, the instruments were piloted with 22 pre-service EFL teachers. They were asked to check the items for clarity and possible ambiguities, and after that some changes were made based on their comments. Having written the items of each scale on Google Forms organized by dimensions of each scale, the final version of the scales was shared with the respondents via WhatsApp, and they were instructed on how to answer the items. Since the participants were MA students, were passing their courses all in English, and had acceptable general English language proficiency, all the items of the questionnaires and the open-ended questions were administered in English. It is worth noting that rapport and trust had been established before conducting this study between the first researcher and the participants as she was sharing with them instructional files on TEFL and was emphasizing the fact that apart from learning theoretical concepts of TEFL, they needed to value implementing theoretical concepts in research and teaching practice, resulting in students’ willingness to participate and learn how to do research about recent developments in teaching English language. Hence, she sent the survey link along with a voice message on WhatsApp groups providing required information to help respondents understand the implications, process of data collection, and completion of the surveys. They were also assured that their identities would be carefully protected.

The internal consistency of the categories of the scales of teacher attitudes was calculated through Cronbach’s alpha, and the reliability coefficient for the dimensions was estimated as values and attitudes (0.74), beliefs (0.60), and self-efficacy (0.87). The reliability of the underlying subscales of the perceived challenges was also reported as attitudinal challenges (0.62), pedagogical challenges (0.82), interactional challenges (0.62), supportive challenges (0.68), and technical challenges (0.75). To undertake confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for the attitude and challenges scales, the researchers used IBM SPSS Amos version 22.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Armonk, NY). The Chi-squared test $( \chi ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { d f } )$ , the goodness-of-fit index (GFI), the comparative fit index (CFI), the normed fit index (NFI), the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the adjusted GFI (AGFI) were used to examine the model fit of CFA. In general, $\chi ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { d f }$ less than 3, GFI, CFI, and NFI above 0.9, RMSEA less than 0.08, and AGFI above 0.85 indicate a good fit (Hooper et  al., 2008; Hu $\&$ Bentler, 1999). CFA results for the three-factor model for the 32 items of the attitude scale showed a good model-fit, representing $\chi ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { d f }$ (1.04), CFI (0.95), GFI (0.91), RMSEA (0.02), NFI (0.92), and AGFI (0.86). CFA results for the five-factor model for the 22 items of the challenges scale also indicated a good model-fit within accepted cut-off values, indicating $\chi ^ { 2 } / \mathrm { d f }$ (1.21), CFI (0.97), GFI (.95), RMSEA (0.04), NFI (0.98), and AGFI (0.89). Figure 1 highlights the fitted model for the three-factor structure of the attitude scale and five-factor structure of the challenges scale.

# Data analysis

To analyze the quantitative data, SPSS version 20 was used. For the attitudes and challenges scales, the percentages for all options, their medians (i.e. midpoint of the data for each item), mean, and standard deviation were calculated. Descriptive statistics were also conducted to analyze the pre-service teachers’ responses to the categories of the attitude scales. Moreover, theme-based analysis was carried out on qualitative data obtained from the open-ended questions. In other words, thematic analysis, the process of determining patterns within the qualitative data, was used and the researchers followed Braun and Clarke (2006) six-step framework (i.e. becoming familiar with the data, generating initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining themes, and writing up). In addition, instead of using apriori codes often drawn from the theoretical frameworks or the literature, posteriori methods were used for analyzing the qualitative data as the literature was reviewed for questionnaires on attitudes and perceived challenges of online teaching, and the researchers were interested in identifying the categories emerged from the data itself. Furthermore, to enhance the coding reliability of the data, the two researchers already familiar with the theme-based procedures followed similar steps for coding, classifying, and analyzing the data. They tried to avoid bias and be consistent in their coding procedures, resulting in high inter-rater reliability (0.90) using Cohen’s kappa. To enhance consistency and to interpret the responses the same way, the two coders had discussion about the best approach to interpreting the data. For instance, they did not apply the same code to the same pieces of data, and after discussion they reached consensus to code the same way two similar but not thoroughly identical responses (e.g. enhancing reflection on learning process/ reflecting on the learning and lack of knowledge of technology/lack of technological knowledge). Additionally, to promote the validity of analyzing the qualitative data, the strategy of low-inference descriptors was used. In other words, the themes suggested were phrased very close to the respondents’ accounts.

# Results

To answer the research questions of the study, both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Quantitative data on pre-service teachers’ attitudes and challenges were analyzed using descriptive statistics. However, for analyzing the qualitative data obtained from the open-ended questions, theme-based analysis was used. The results of these analyses are provided below.

# Attitudes toward online teaching

To determine pre-service teachers’ attitudes toward teaching online language courses, a 32-item questionnaire comprising three subscales of teachers’ values and attitudes, teachers’ beliefs, and teachers’ communication self-efficacy was administered. Percentages and medians of each item of this scale along with mean and standard deviation were calculated. It is worth noting that due to the number of participants, the values for frequency and percentage of all options were the same and for this reason, only the percentage for each option was reported. The results of these analyses are presented in Tables 1–3.

As shown in Table 1, the highest percentage of agreement $( 4 5 \% )$ was obtained by the item of ‘providing opportunities for language teaching and learning through advances in online information technologies’, while the highest percentage of disagreement $( 1 5 \% )$ was related to the item of ‘not trusting the online teaching environment’. As also highlighted in Table 1, the highest mean was gained by the item of providing opportunities for language teaching and learning through technology advancement $( M = 4 . 3 4 )$ ), while the lowest one was received by the item of online teaching not being part of their teaching plan $\left( M = ~ 2 . 3 9 \right)$ . Moreover, the responses to the item of requiring too much design time for using online teaching technology $\left( \mathrm { S D } \mathrm { = } ~ 1 . 0 6 \right)$ ), whereas those to the item of making professional work more difficult through technology use were the most homogeneous $ { \left( \mathrm { S D } \ = \ 0 . 7 4 \right) }$ . Table 1 also indicates that nine items related to pre-service teachers’ values and attitudes toward online teaching received the highest median (Median $= \ 4 \AA$ ). That is, pre-service teachers held the opinion that online information technology could improve language learning and teaching methods and learner-teacher communication. However, they considered that using technology for teaching requires too much design time. They also found themselves confident for online teaching and preferred blended courses despite the lack of administrative support for using online learning technology. As also indicated in Table 1, three items about teachers’ attitudes toward online teaching received the lowest median (median $\mathit { \Theta } = \mathit { \Theta } 2 \mathit { \check { \Psi } }$ ). In other words, pre-service teachers perceived online teaching part of their teaching plan and could trust the online teaching. In addition, they did not think the advances in online learning technology could cause language teachers to lose their job. The results of pre-service teachers’ beliefs about online teaching are presented in Table 2.

Table 2 indicates that the highest percentage $( 3 1 \% )$ for the option of strongly agree was received by ‘enjoying using computers and the Internet instructionally’, while the lowest percentage $( 1 \% )$ for the option of strongly disagree was obtained by the item of ‘computers should be as important and available to students as pencils and books’. Table 2 also highlights that the highest mean was obtained by making professional work more difficult through technology use $\stackrel { \prime } { M } = ~ 4 . 2 3 )$ ), whereas the lowest one was received by the item of enjoying using computers and the Internet $( M = 2 . 2 1 )$ . Furthermore, the responses to the item of using computers to help solve problems were the most heterogeneous $( \mathrm { S D } { = } ~ 1 . 1 0 ) ,$ ), while those to the item of making professional work more difficult were the most homogeneous $\mathrm { ( S D ~ = ~ 0 . 6 0 } \mathrm { ) }$ ). As also shown in Table 2, five items related to the pre-service teachers’ beliefs about online teaching received the highest median (Median $= \ 4 \AA$ ). In other words, pre-service teachers held the view that the quality of English education could be improved by the use of technology, and computers should be as important and available to students as pencils and books. They also considered themselves interested and confident of using technology as a learning resource. However, they believed that technology could make their professional work more difficult and time-consuming (Median $=$ 2). The results of pre-service teachers’ self-efficacy for online interaction are provided in Table 3.

Table 3 shows that the highest percentage $( 3 2 \% )$ for ‘strongly agree’ was obtained by ‘feeling confident in using online tools to effectively communicate with students’, whereas the lowest percentage $( 0 \% )$ was received by the items of feeling confident in responding and posting questions in online discussions. Table 3 also indicates that the highest mean was related to feeling confident in responding to online questions $\left( M = ~ 4 . 0 9 \right)$ , while the lowest one was concerned with feeling confident in using online tools $\left( M = 3 . 9 4 \right)$ . Additionally, the responses to the item of feeling confident in posting questions were the most heterogeneous $\left( \mathrm { S D } = 0 . 9 4 \right)$ , while those to the item of feeling confident in expressing themselves through texts were the most homogeneous $\mathrm { ( S D = 0 } . 6 9 )$ ). As highlighted in Table 3, all items related to communication self-efficacy received the same median, indicating that the pre-service teachers found themselves self-efficacious for online communication. In particular, they perceived themselves self-efficacious for addressing and responding to students’ questions, expressing their feelings, and using online interaction tools.

Since this study was conducted in IUST, where CALL course was offered to both F2F and online TEFL students, apart from the attitude scale, four open-ended questions were administered. The participants’ responses to the first question about their interest in teaching online language courses are presented as follows: most of the participants $( 7 5 \% )$ were interested to teach online courses, and some of their reasons included: ‘Because technology is an inevitable part of our life, especially for learning’; ‘It is more useful than F2F classes’; ‘I feel confident of teaching English language online as a new experience’; ‘Online courses can solve numerous problems teachers are nowadays dealing with’; and ‘With the growth of the Internet, online language learning/teaching is increased’. Seventeen percent of the participants had negative responses to the question, and some of their reasons were: ‘I prefer traditional language teaching as online teaching has some limitations, such as no F2F interaction and oral communication’; ‘Society has negative attitudes toward online teaching’; and ‘I need to prepare myself with the stuff needed for online teaching, which is time-consuming’. Eight percent of the respondents stated that they were to some extent interested to teach online language courses, and some of their reasons were as follows: ‘I am not convinced because of the Internet speed and electricity cut-off ’; ‘I have not received adequate education yet’; and ‘I prefer to teach blended courses (i.e. online and F2F classes)’.

The second open-ended question was about the extent to which the professional development programs of TEFL could prepare pre-service teachers to teach online language courses, and the participants’ responses were as follows: $3 0 \%$ of the pre-service teachers responded to a great extent, and some of their reasons included: ʻStudying TEFL courses met their educational needs’; ‘They became aware of online methods and strategies through studying TEFL coursesʼ; ʻStudying at the e-learning campus of IUST made them think of teaching online language courses’; and ʻHaving observed a professor teaching online courses made them quite aware of how to teach online coursesʼ. On the contrary, $5 4 \%$ of the participants responded to a little extent, and their reasons were as follows: ʻThere should be specific instructional programs to effectively prepare teachers to teach online coursesʼ; ‘CALL course was not efficient enoughʼ; ʻCALL course did not pay enough attention to preparing student teachers to be capable of teaching online language coursesʼ; ʻTeachers needed to be engaged in more technology-related teaching in order to be able to teach online coursesʼ; ʻWhat covered in the CALL course was just familiarity with theories rather than practicing themʼ; ʻTeaching online courses needs more education and more technological knowledge than what is currently being taught in universitiesʼ; ʻWe just got familiar with online teaching and did not learn how to implement effective methods, strategies, and technologies in online coursesʼ; ʻIt was only helpful in theory but not in practiceʼ; and ʻThere was not much focus on online teaching’. In addition, $1 6 \%$ of the pre-service teachers stated that MA program of TEFL could to some extent prepare them to be capable of teaching online courses. However, they stated that it was not adequate, and they needed more education to be an effective online language teacher.

The third open-ended question about the effectiveness of online teaching in learners’ language development was asked, and $6 8 \%$ of the student teachers emphasized the high impact of online English language courses on learners’ language development, while $1 0 \%$ of whom held the view that online teaching could to some extent promote students’ language development. Their most frequent reasons included motivating students for more learning $( 2 0 \% )$ , being attractive to students $( 1 8 \% )$ , promoting students’ self-regulation $( 1 5 \% )$ , promoting collaborative learning $( 1 1 \% )$ , engaging students in learning English $( 1 0 \% )$ , enhancing reflection on learning process $( 8 \% )$ , having various sources available $( 8 \% )$ , and saving students’ time $( 5 \% )$ . However, $2 2 \%$ of their responses to the third question were negative, and the most frequent reasons were lack of real communication $( 1 0 \% )$ ; diverse characteristics of learners $( 8 \% )$ , having inadequate knowledge $( 5 \% )$ , and being time-consuming $( 3 \% )$ . The last open-ended question was about student teachers’ ability to teach online language courses, and $6 6 \%$ of the participants considered themselves self-efficacious for online teaching due to their positive attitude toward online teaching. However, $2 2 \%$ of the participants did not consider themselves self-efficacious due to the lack of experimental courses and education $( 1 2 \% )$ , lack of information $( 9 \% )$ , and being so time-consuming $( 4 \% )$ . In addition, $1 8 \%$ of the participants stated that they were to some extent able to teach online courses, and their uncertainty was due to the lack of instruction $( 1 1 \% )$ and lack of experience $( 7 \% )$ .

# Perceived challenges of online teaching

To investigate the perceived challenges EFL teachers may encounter in teaching online language courses, a questionnaire with 22 items in five subscales was administered. The subscales included attitudinal, pedagogical, interactional, supportive, and technical challenges. The percentage, median, mean, and standard deviation of pre-service teachers’ concerns about teaching online language courses were calculated. The results of these analyses are provided in Table 4.

Table 4 indicates that the highest amount of agreement $( 7 9 \% )$ was obtained by ‘effort demands to keep up effective teaching practices with the pace of rapid changes in technology’. Moreover, no pre-service teacher chose the option of strongly disagree for the item about having stress due to taking on numerous new online roles. As also highlighted in Table 4, the highest median values for attitudinal challenges of online teaching were obtained by four challenges of perceiving online teaching as an addition to workload, demanding efforts to develop online courses, keeping up online teaching with the rapid changes in technology, and being stressed due to taking new online teaching roles. However, the lowest median was received by being labor intensive because of the amount of time required to grade and respond to questions. Table 4 also shows that the highest mean was obtained by the challenge of being labor intensive $( M = ~ 3 . 8 7 )$ ), while the lowest one was received by the challenge of keeping online teaching up-to-date $( M = 3 . 2 3 )$ . In addition, the responses to the challenge of keeping online teaching up-to-date were the most heterogeneous $\mathrm { \prime S D } = 0 . 9 2 \mathrm { \prime }$ , while those to the challenge of not considering online tools important were the most homogeneous $\mathrm { ( S D = 0 . 7 1 ) }$ ). Given the results of student teachers’ responses to attitudinal challenges, it can be stated that they found developing online courses, taking new online roles, and keeping up their teaching with new technologies as the most challenging issues.

Given the pedagogical challenges of online teaching, the most frequent challenge $( 8 5 \% )$ was related to lack of previous online learning experience. However, no one chose the option of strongly disagree for the three items of lack of previous online learning experience, lack of technical expertise among instructors, and their poor knowledge of online teaching skills. The results indicated that the highest mean was obtained by the challenge of lack of previous online learning experience $\left( M = 4 . 0 6 \right)$ , while the lowest one was related to the challenge of teachers’ poor knowledge of online tools $\mathit { M } \phantom { \left( \lambda \right) } M = \ 3 . 8 0 \rangle$ ). Ranking student teachers’ pedagogical challenges in order of magnitude, all six pedagogical challenges received the same median value, indicating that lack of effective teacher education, e-learning experience, teaching skills, online roles, online tools, and technical expertise were the challenges teachers could deal with in teaching online English language classes. The percentages, median, mean, and standard deviation of student teachers’ interactional challenges are provided in Table 5.

Table 5 indicates that the challenge of absence of tone of voice, body language, and nonverbal communication clues received the highest percentage $( 2 9 \% )$ for the option of strongly agree, while no one $( 0 \% )$ chose the option of strongly disagree for the challenge of difficulty managing student communication. As also shown in Table 5, all interactional challenges received the same median value. Table 5 also highlights that the highest mean was gained by the challenge of managing student communication $\left( M = ~ 3 . 8 6 \right)$ , while the lowest one was received by the challenge of students’ lack of motivation for online communication $\langle M = ~ 3 . 2 5 )$ . Moreover, the responses to the challenge of students’ lack of motivation for online communication were the most heterogeneous $( \mathrm { S D } \ b { = } \ 1 . 1 3 )$ ), whereas those to the challenge of providing feedback to students were the most homogeneous $\left( \mathrm { S D } = 0 . 8 7 \right)$ . It can be stated that student teachers perceived key issues related to online interaction challenging; in other words, providing online feedback, managing online interaction, fostering motivation for online learning, and lack of nonverbal cues were found the most challenging factors for enhancing online interaction. The results of descriptive statistics of pre-service EFL teachers’ supportive challenges of online teaching are presented in Table 6.

Table 6 shows that the highest percentage of agreement, median, and mean were obtained by lack of administrative support from institutions, while the lowest percentage, median, and mean were related to others’ lack of acceptance of online teaching practice. Table 6 also indicates that the responses to the challenge of lack of acceptance of online teaching were the most heterogeneous $\mathrm { ( S D = ~ 1 . 1 1 }$ ), while those to the challenge of lack of administrative support from institutions were the most homogeneous $\langle \mathrm { S D } = 0 . 9 2 \rangle$ . As also highlighted in Table 6, given the participants’ responses to the supportive challenges, it could be stated that they considered the lack of administrative support for online teaching more challenging than others’ perceptions of their online teaching practice. Participants’ responses to their technical challenges of online teaching are provided in Table 7.

Table 7 shows that slow internet connections obtained the highest percentage $( 5 5 \% )$ for the option of strongly agree, while equipment concerns, including inadequate software and hardware received the lowest percentage $( 0 \% )$ for the option of strongly disagree. As also shown in Table 7, with regard to technical challenges, the highest median was obtained by slow Internet connection, whereas the lowest medians were related to three technical challenges of lack of software and hardware, accessibility to online learning system, and reliability of technological tools. Table 7 also highlights that the highest mean was obtained by the challenge of robustness and reliability of the tools $\stackrel { \prime } { M } = ~ 4 . 4 4 )$ , while the lowest mean was received by the challenge of equipment concerns $\left( M = ~ 3 . 5 6 \right)$ . In addition, the responses to the challenge of equipment concerns were the most heterogeneous $\left( \mathrm { S D } = 0 . 9 0 \right)$ ), whereas those to the challenge of reliability of the tools were the most homogeneous (SD $= 0 . 7 4 )$ . Given the participants’ responses, it can be stated that for the majority of pre-service teachers, slow Internet connection was the most challenge of online teaching. Descriptive statistics of the categories of attitudinal, pedagogical, interactional, supportive, and technical challenges are provided in Table 8. Having performed preliminary analysis, including normality, linearity, and homoscedasticity, the researchers also conducted Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient for the categories of the challenges of online teaching, and the results are presented in Table 8.

$^ { \ast \ast } p < 0 . 0 1$ (2-tailed).

As highlighted in Table 8, participants’ most challenges were related to technical challenges $\mathit { M } \mathit { = } \ 3 . 9 7 )$ , while the lowest challenges were concerned with attitudinal ones $\mathit { M } = 3 . 4 7 )$ ). The perceived challenges of online teaching could be hierarchically ranked as technical, pedagogical, interactional, supportive, and attitudinal. Table 8 also indicates that the responses to the supportive challenges were the most heterogeneous (SD $= \ 0 . 8 9 )$ , whereas those to attitudinal challenges were the most homogeneous $\left( \mathrm { S D } ~ = ~ 0 . 4 9 \right)$ . Table 8 also shows strong, positive correlation between pedagogical and technical challenges ${ r = } 0 . 5 1 6 )$ , with high levels of technical challenges associated with high levels of pedagogical challenges. Furthermore, moderate, positive correlation was found between supportive and technical ${ r = 0 . 4 7 0 }$ ), interactional and supportive $\stackrel { \prime } { r } = 0 . 3 3 0 )$ , interactional and technical $\stackrel { \prime } { r } = 0 . 3 3 2 )$ , attitudinal and interactional ${ r = } 0 . 4 1 6 { } ,$ ), and attitudinal and supportive challenges $\stackrel { \prime } { r } = 0 . 4 2 5 )$ . In addition to the questionnaire, an open-ended question about their main challenges of teaching online language courses was asked to highlight teachers’ concerns about online teaching. Although $1 1 \%$ of the respondents stated that they had nothing more to add to the list of the challenges, the themes in others’ responses $( 8 9 \% )$ included connection problems $( 4 0 \% )$ , lack of education and familiarity to use online tools $( 2 0 \% )$ , communication difficulties $( 1 7 \% )$ , limitation and lack of access to tools $( 1 1 \% )$ , lack of technological knowledge $( 9 \% )$ , time management problems $( 8 \% )$ , lack of required knowledge and skills $( 7 \% )$ , negative attitude toward online learning $( 6 \% )$ , keeping students motivated $( 6 \% )$ , lack of teachers’ motivation for online teaching $( 5 \% )$ , and difficulty providing feedback to students $( 5 \% )$ . Some examples of their concerns are provided below.

# Connection problems

‘Iranian online teachers do not have access to strong Internet connection, which can influence the quality of online learning and teaching.’

# Lack of education on using online tools

‘Appropriate professional education is not offered to pre-service teachers before teaching an actual online course.’

‘We are dealing with lack of familiarity with various online tools both on the part of teachers and students because teacher professional development programs mostly focus on theoretical issues.’

# Communication difficulties

‘My main challenge would be difficulty in establishing effective, collaborative communication in online classes.’

‘I think the main challenge is fostering effective online communication due to lack of F2F and non-verbal interactions, which leads to misunderstanding.’

# Limitation and lack of access to tools

‘While working with tools in online classes, I do not have access to all features of a platform because of the platform’s policy.’

‘I always have problems with having access to some tools and their specific features.’

# Lack of technological knowledge

‘We are always witnessing ongoing advancement in online technologies. Hence, the current challenge and future trend would be keeping up with the continuous technological advances.’

# Time management problems

‘Managing time in online courses would be one of the main challenges of online teachers, which requires familiarity with effective strategies of time management.’

# Lack of required knowledge and skills

‘I do not have adequate knowledge of how to use useful, relevant tools for promoting effective online teaching and communication.’

‘I believe the main challenges are teachers’ insufficient experience with teaching online language courses and their unfamiliarity with the required knowledge and skills.’

# Negative attitude toward online learning

‘We sometimes face negative perceptions of online teaching/learning in some language institutes, which influences their measures for supplying the required infrastructure and offering effective instructional courses.’

‘Some students prefer F2F classes and show negative attitudes toward online learning. Hence, they do not take online learning seriously.’

# Keeping students motivated

‘Unfortunately, some students do not have active participation in online tasks. For this reason, teachers should be familiar with various strategies to encourage them for online engagement.’

‘I think the most important challenge of online teachers is motivating students while there is no F2F interaction.’

# Lack of teachers’ motivation for online teaching

‘Unfortunately, some of teachers’ concerns about online teaching are neglected by institutes, which may lead to teachers’ demotivation for effective online teaching.

‘Some online teachers are demotivated because they are forced to teach online courses without preparation and adequate support.’

# Difficulty providing feedback to students

‘I think the most difficult part is having ongoing assessment, monitoring, and giving feedback to online students’ tasks and activities.’

# Conclusions and discussion

The study was conducted with the purpose of investigating attitudes and perceived challenges of pre-service EFL teachers about online teaching. Regarding their attitudes, the results indicated that they mostly held the view that using technologies can promote language learning/teaching and learner–teacher communication. They also preferred blended courses and felt confident of online interaction and held the opinion that online English language teaching can promote students’ language development, self-regulation, collaborative learning, motivation, and engagement. Pre-service teachers also reported high awareness of communication self-efficacy. Moreover, it was found that although most of them were interested to teach online language courses and believed that they would be capable of teaching online courses, professional development programs offered to them, as also confirmed by Fathi and Ebadi (2020), could not prepare them efficiently enough for online teaching experiences.

Although teaching online English courses requires significant amount of design time, student teachers showed positive attitudes and believed that it could promote students’ performance, as also emphasized by Manegre and Sabiri (2020). This might be due to the fact that nowadays technology is an integral part of students’ lives, and that students have a strong connection with ICT. Students can also benefit from the technology use in their language learning, and therefore, their teachers should make the best use of technology in their teaching. This finding substantiates that of Gönen (2019), who found that despite facing some concerns in integrating technology, student teachers expressed a positive attitude toward technology use. This finding also confirms that of Knezek and Christensen (2016), who found that for teachers having a high degree of technology integration, their willingness is regarded the most important predictor.

Despite having no practical experience of teaching online courses, student teachers also reported high awareness of communication self-efficacy due to the instruction they already received on self-efficacy in their curriculum. This finding is confirmed by that of Hung (2016), showing that having communication self-efficacy is vital for tackling the limitations existing in online communication. This finding also substantiates that of Dorsah (2021) as online communication self-efficacy plays a crucial role in online language teachers’ readiness to successfully integrate technology into their future career. Pre-service teachers of this study did not believe that the professional development programs of TEFL could prepare them adequately to have effective online teaching due to emphasizing theoretical issues more than practical aspects of online teaching. These results are in consistent with those of Kessler (2006), indicating that teachers were dissatisfied with education on CALL and lack of preparation.

Regarding pre-service teachers’ perceived challenges of teaching online courses, both the quantitative and qualitative results highlighted that their concerns were mostly related to technical challenges mainly due to unstable and slow Internet connections in Iran. Moreover, Internet infrastructure is not of good quality. Specifically, slow and unstable connection can constantly result in the interruption of learning, learners’ distraction, and less effective online teaching. The results lend support to those of Adedoyin and Soykan (2020), Gönen (2019), and Nkonge and Gueldenzolph (2006), who identified poor Internet connections as the most significant challenge, which could reduce the positive perception and even distract students from engaging in online activities.

Pedagogical challenges were the other highly reported perceived challenges. For example, no prior online learning experience, inefficient teaching skills, lack of technical expertise, and inadequate knowledge to meet the purposes of online tools were found the major pedagogical challenges of pre-service teachers. Their concerns may be due to the fact that student teachers do not have the opportunity to experience online teaching during their education programs and as Tondeur et  al. (2016) highlight, they can benefit more from CALL courses provided that they gain some field experience in actual use of technology in their classrooms. However, teacher professional development courses failed to equip prospective teachers with the essential education in using technological tools and the knowledge and skills required to make online teaching more effective, since they merely provide them with information about diverse technological tools rather than their actual use in online classes. These results are in agreement with those of Kessler (2006), indicating that there is the issue of contextualization in CALL preparation programs since these programs only cover digital literacy to a great extent. The findings further support those of Mahdizadeh et  al. (2008) who found that using technologies for education resulted in some barriers of which previous online learning experience and lack of education in online teaching were the two main ones, and those of Sun (2011) emphasizing that lack of straightforward methodology to efficiently incorporate technology is among the concerns in online education programs.

Given pre-service teachers’ views about interactional challenges, fostering online learners’ motivation, providing online feedback, managing online interactions, and lack of non-verbal cues were considered significant. This could be attributed to the fact that student teachers are not given specific instructions during their TEFL programs; accordingly, they feel the need to be educated more on methods, techniques, and strategies of how to manage online communications, foster online learning community, and motivate students for online learning. Since providing online feedback is the specialized and subtle side of online teaching, the pre-service teachers are definitely not acquainted with the strategies of giving online feedback. Additionally, due to the lack of non-verbal and F2F interactions, it is probably difficult for them to establish effective online communications, which might lead to learners’ misunderstanding. These findings confirm those of Bailey and Card (2009), indicating that online environments lack non-verbal communication clues, including tone of voice and body language.

It was found that pre-service EFL teachers were more concerned about lack of administrative support for online teaching than the perceptions of others and society about their online teaching practices. This is probably because the language institutes and higher education programs are expected to lend their support by offering more systematic courses on online teacher professional development and allocating technical experts, emphasizing that the policymakers need to contemplate twice about the infrastructure of online education. These results substantiate those of Nelson and Thompson (2005), indicating the administrative support among the barriers of teaching online courses. The findings also lend support to those of Aslan and Zhu (2016), Allen and Seaman (2007), and Keengwe et  al. (2008), who found that online teachers require more technical and instructional support.

Among all challenges, attitudinal ones were considered the least significant. It seems that prospective teachers have already realized the prominence of online education and feel interested and competent in online education. The results on various categories of challenges confirmed the findings on prospective teachers’ views about integrating technology into their career and their positive attitudes toward transition to online courses. They, however, perceived developing online courses, keeping up their teaching with new technological tools, and fulfilling their new online roles as a workload to their career. This is mainly due to the limited and inefficient instruction the student teachers receive as part of their professional development programs in which they are not educated about online teacher roles and the demanding efforts required to develop online courses. This finding is in congruent with a number of studies (e.g. Adedoyin & Soykan, 2020; Comas-Quinn, 2011; Gerlich, 2005; Grosse, 2004; Matsom, 2006; Nelson & Thompson, 2005; Wegmann & McCauley, 2008), indicating that teachers consider online teaching more labor-intensive.

Given the findings, some implications can be suggested. For instance, it is argued that enhancing opportunities for potential online teachers to use technologies and to participate in technology-integrated activities could positively influence their attitudes toward online education. Moreover, there is a demand for effective education for pre-service teachers to maintain their positive attitudes and beliefs or change them for the best to help them learn the strategies of effective online teaching and interaction, leading to fostering learners’ online self-efficacy and self-regulation. In addition, student teachers’ satisfaction with CALL preparation courses can be enhanced through fostering student teachers’ awareness of the benefits of educational technologies and offering effective instruction for using technological tools for language teaching. In other words, teacher educators can offer effective online teacher professional development courses to encourage student teachers to use technology and to enhance the quality of their online courses. To diminish pedagogical challenges of online teaching, pre-service teachers need education to become familiar with the prerequisite skills, knowledge, and pedagogical purposes assigned to technological tools, leading to encouraging them to implement technologies effectively in their online language courses. Teacher educators should further provide pre-service teachers with instruction on online feedback and motivational strategies to reduce online interactional challenges, making learners free from feeling of isolation due to the lack of non-verbal interactions. As the teaching trends move towards online teaching, student teachers are also supposed to be educated in a way that they can manage teaching online language courses effectively in terms of time, content, misbehavior, communication, motivation, and feedback.

In addition to the above-mentioned implications for teacher educators and policymakers, support teams, such as technology staff and instructional designers should also constantly consult with online teachers about making decisions and solving problems of teaching processes and designing online courses. For example, teachers need support, preparedness, and opportunities to explore their own ways to change and adapt their current pedagogies to online teaching, use technologies effectively for pedagogical purposes, and most importantly, develop and maintain positive attitudes toward online teaching. For a long-term retention of online teaching/learning, all parties should collaborate with each other to promote ongoing professional development programs for online teachers (Gruba & Chau Nguyen, 2019). Therefore, since pre-service teachers feel the lack of adequate preparation for teaching online courses, more CALL courses need to be implemented in university curriculums, and rather than being merely theoretical, they should be in line with new trends in online teaching and existing technologies.

Given the findings, it is argued that researchers interested in online language teacher professional development can conduct the following research. For instance, future researchers can examine the impact of teachers’ positive attitudes and beliefs on students’ language development. More specifically, the performance of teachers with positive and negative attitudes and beliefs can be compared through making observation of their online classes and administering tests, questionnaires, and interview with their students. Moreover, they can investigate the impact of pre-service teachers’ education on having more efficient online courses in a long run and can further compare the same student teachers’ attitudes after a year of instruction and real practice. They can also examine the impact of instruction about technological tools, strategies, and techniques of online interaction on prospective teachers’ online interaction self-efficacy. For example, teacher educators can prepare student teachers by offering appropriate courses to enhance their knowledge of online interaction, pedagogical purposes and benefits of interactional tools, and how to use them for teaching language skills. After that, the impact of such instruction on teachers’ online interaction self-efficacy can be investigated. Furthermore, the ideas of learner-centeredness and constructivist beliefs can be explored in future studies on online education.

More detailed questions would be also worth considering to come up with a wider picture of pre-service teachers’ concerns to reach rational solutions accordingly. It is worth noting that there were several items (e.g. items 2–5 and 7–22) in the questionnaire on perceived challenges of online teaching that were not phrased as statements with which one could agree or disagree. This could be considered a limitation of the methods followed when conducting the research. The next limitation was related to the low-reliability values for some categories in the scales of attitudes and challenges, which were related to the sensitivity of Cronbach alpha value to the number of items in scales. Another limitation was concerned with diverse resources in terms of year, country, teachers, and students included in this study. This issue emphasizes the significance of exploring students’ and teachers’ attitudes and beliefs in online English language courses offered in various contexts.
