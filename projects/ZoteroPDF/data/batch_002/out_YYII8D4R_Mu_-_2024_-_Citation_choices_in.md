Citation choices Responsibilities Attitudes Reporting verbs Academic writing

In response to Petric's (2012) callfor comparing citation practices between student and published writing in the same field to better understand the interaction between developmental and disciplinary influences on the utilization of direct quotation, this paper conducts a comparative analysis of citation choices in 100 literature review sections of L2 master's theses and 100 research article literature review sections in the field of translation studies. This analysis utilizes a modified framework of functional options for cited information. The findings reveal a significant difference in the normalized frequency of citation options between the student corpus and the expert corpus. L2 master's students predominantly rely on single-source, author-responsible, long direct quotations with active voice and past tense. This approach is used to present source information without active engagement, suggesting their primary objective is to showcase knowledge of the research field. Conversely, experts strategically employ citations to support their claims and establish intertextual links. The differences in citation choices between master's theses and research articles might be attributed to the L2 students' limited grasp of the subtle nuances associated with citation forms, reporting verbs, verb tenses and voices, as well as a lack of proficiency in employing various pragmatic and rhetorical functions achievable through citation. Additionally, these differences may be attributed to the comprehensive knowledge and experience accumulated by expert writers over time. The implications of these findings for teaching English academic writing are discussed within the paper.

# 1. Introduction

Academic witers (here writers" refer to those who citereference, while authors' i this paper will be used to refer to those who are cited following Thompson and Ye [1991]) utilize citations for multiple purposes, such as establishing their connection to a disciplinary community, demonstrating familiarity with existing literature, placing their research within a rhetorical context, constructing thir authorial identit, and offring evidence o support their arguments (Hewings et al., 2010; Hyland, 199, 2000; Lee et al., 2018; Peti, 207; Scollon, 1994). However, novice academic writers particularly those who are second language (L2) learners, encounter significant challenges when employig citations a they face a bewildering array of choices regarding syntax, tense, voice, and rhetorical purpose when referencing previous research (Charles, 2006; Thomas & Hawes, 1994).

Inexperienced writers tend to rely on single source citations (Wette, 2017), use inappropriate reporting verbs (Thompson & Tribble, 2001), excesively rely on source to showcase their understanding f topic in an objective manner (Le t al., 2018), and fal to adopt an evaluative stance towards the sources, leading to confusion or misinterpretation of the writer's and author'sattitudes towards the cited information (Groom, 200; McCulloch, 2012). While academic writing textboos and course materias typicall offer general guidance to students on how to quote, paraphrase, and summarize information from sources, they ofen lack detailed information regarding the \*implicit evaluation' (Hunston, 1995) of diffrent citation choice, including the rhetorical purposes and atitudes that can be expressed through various citation options (Harwood, 2010; Thompson & Tribble, 2001).

To illustrat the implicit and flexible function of different citation choices, an example from our expert corpus is preented below.

(1) In a recent Swis study, Wissmath et al. (2009) investigated the effects of dubbing versus subtiting on psychological immersion, assessed through the four measures of presence, transportation, flow, and enjoyment. They found that the translation method does not have a significant influence on the participants' evaluation of the film experience. The results corroborate the hypothesis that dubbing results in the highest levels of presence, transportation, and flow, but that the translation method has no major effect on enjoyment, rrespective of film genre. The authors conclude that the potential differences in the evaluative effects f the two translation methods have been overstated. Wissmath et al. (2009), however, did not investigate the cognitive effects of the two translation methods. (E044)

The expert writers in the above example demonstrate a remarkable flexibility in their use of tenses and voices when reporting previous studies. They employ the past tense to provide a narrative of prior research, while the present tense is utilized to convey general conclusions. Furthermore, they skilfully employ the preset perfct tense in the passive voice (e.g., have been overstated to directl illutrate the acknowledged research gap relevant to thir own study. As they transition to the past tense, they emphasize the specific niche identified fromWissmath et al.s research, serving the purose of mitigating potential face-threatening situations. These adept and adaptable citation practices are often taken for granted by experienced scholars (Petric, 2012). However, it i noteworthy that the significant yet \*implicit evaluations Hunston, 1995) that underlie these reporting forms are typically lft unaddressed and untaught for novice writers.

Graduate students, as individuals on the path to becoming scholars, acquire the art of scholarly writing by co-authoring research articles, often interlinked with their thesis work (Dong, 1996). A common practice among them is to utilize published journal articles as templates for crafting their own academic prose (Flowerdew & Li, 2007). Thus, comparing the utilization of citations betwen masters theses and reearch articles serves as a valuable aid for budding researchers, including master's students. I assts them in refining their citation practices and understanding how to convey their atitudes towards source materils through citations, critical skill in constructing persuasive arguments (Hyland, 1999, 2000).

While it i acknowledged that masters thees and rearch artile serve distinct rhetorical puroses and cater to different audience expectations (Harwood, 2010; Samraj, 2008), they converge in their shared goal of convincing the disciplinary community of the validity of their research. This persuasion is particularly evident in their literature review sections (Basturkmen, 2009; Koutsanton 2006). Regrettably, there has been relatively scant research that directly compares citation choices in master's theses and journal article, and even fewer studes have fouse on the spfics of liture review sections, with  few etions   et al, 2018; Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011; Samraj, 2013). Nevertheless, these comparative inquiries have provided limited insights into the implicit evaluations embedded in citation choices, often relying on qualitative methods with small-cale datasets.

Responding to the call made by Petric (2012) for comparing citation practices between student and published writing in the same discipline to understand the interface between developmental and disciplinary factors in the use of direct quotation' (p. 115) this study endeavors to juxtapose citation-related choices in the literature review sections of L2 master's theses and those in the research article literature review sections within the domain of translation studies. To facilitate this comparison, a modified framework of functional options for citations has been proposed. This framework comprises four dimensions of choices for cited information: message (encompassing fragment quotations, incorporated quotations, unincorporated quotations, block quotations, summary, and generalization), signal (tense and voice),attitude (writer/author stance), and responsibilit (writer/author/shared responsibility). A detailed exposition of this framework will be provided in the methods section below.

For the purpose of constructing our corpus, we have selectively confined our data collection to the litrature review sections within the field of translation studies. This deliberate limitation is intended to mitigate the influence of disciplinary and section-specific variations on the inal results. Diffrent academic disciplines and various sections within theses and research articles often manifest distinct modes of argumentation tailored to their specific rhetorical objectives and conceptions of value and communication (Hyland 2004; Samraj, 2013).

Additionally, our focus on translation studies is motivated by personal interest, as I serve as an instructor for a research meth odology course designed for master's students specializing in translation studies. In the course of my teaching experience, I have observed that thee students frequently grapple with challenge related to the efective use of cited information, particularly within the context of literature review sections. Furthrmore, minimal reearch attention has be devoted to the omparative analysis of citation practices between students and experts in the field of translation studies. Consequently, this paper seeks to address the following questions.

1. Is there a disparity in citation choices within literature review sections between L2 master's students and experts in the field of translation studies, as observed through the dimensions of message, signal, attitude and responsibility? 2. If such differences exist, what are they, and how can they be characterized?

The findings of this study can be used to develop instructional resources focusing on more advanced citation practices for L2 master's students and junior scholars (Samraj, 2013). Additionally, these materials may also benefit novice writers of English as a first

language as they acclimate to disciplinary communities

# 2. Literature review

Research on the use of cited information in academic writing has primarily focused on issues related to plagiarism, including the consequences of inadequate source citation (Campell 1990; Howard, 1995; Keck, 2006; McCulloch, 2012; Pecorari, 206; Shi, 2010) L2 students tend to vie citations as a means f protectig themselve against plagiarism acusations, but they ofte trbute excessive authority to their source and fail to adopt a sfficienly evaluative stance towards them (McCulloch, 2012). Hwever, there have also been studies examining various aspects of itation use in different disciplines. These studies have explored the types and functions of citations (Harwo0d, 2009; Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011; Petric, 2007; Thompson, 1996; Thompson, 2005), cultural variations in citation practices (Belcher, 1994; Bloch & Chi, 1995; Pennycook, 1996), the historical development of citation as an academic writing practice (Bazerman, 1988; Salager-Meyer, 199), and the choice of reporting verbs in conjunction with citations (Charles, 2006; Hawes & Thomas, 1997; Hyland, 1999; Thompson, 2001; Thompson & Ye, 1991). It is noteworthy that Thompson (1996) offers a highly valuable and comprehensiv framework encompassing message, signal,attitude and voice for analyzing and comprehending the diverse ways in which language reports are incorporated into texts. Nevertheles, his framework primarily addresses language reports in various types of writing, such as literature, journalism, and academic writing, etc. To align with the scope of the current study, it is necessary to adapt his framework by integrating recent advancements in citation studies within the academic writing domain, as will be introduced below.

In their analyses ofstudent writing, several scholars (e.g., Borg, 2000; Kibler & Hardigree 2017; Petric, 2012) have categorized citations into distinct forms, primarily as direct quotations, paraphrases, and summaries. Borg (200) and Petric (2012) extended this categorization by further subdividing direct quotations into threesubtypes: quotation fragments (short stretches of textual borrowing shorter than a T-unit), brief quotations (T-units shorter than 40 words), and extended quotations (often referred to as block quotations). An additional level of granularity was introduced by distinguishing between incorporated quotations (integrated within the writer's sentence, typically involving descriptions of the author or source) and unincorporated quotations (not integrated within the writer's sentence) (Kibler & Hardigree, 2017; Swales, 1986). In a large-scale analysis of journal research articles, Hyland and Jiang (2019) adopted a four-ategory system for itations, encompassing direct fragment quotations (typicall citig three or four words), direct block quotations (exceding 20 words in length), summaries (drawing from a single source), and generalizations (derived from multiple sources). These studies collctively demonstrate the existence of diverse citation taxonomies utilized in the examination of writing by both students and experts. To effectively compare citations between these two groups, there arises a need to harmonize these taxonomies into a unified framework..

Numerous studies (e.g., Harwood, 2009; Hewings et al., 2010; Hyland & Jiang, 2019; Sun & Yang, 2015) have also investigated citation practices among professional academic writers. Hyland (199) discovered that writers i the humanities and social sciences tend to use more citations compared to those in the sciences and engineering. Furthermore, they are more inclined to employ discourse reporting verbs, uiize inal stctres ., Brie [1999] pins out tht .), and rreent cited athrs as adoptig an ealuative stance towards a particular proposition. In contrast, Thompson and Trible (2001, p. 95, 96) found that agricultural botanists pri marily used the functions of source (indicating where the idea comes from, e.g., itation is central .. because it can provide justification for arguments [Gilbert, 1976]) and identification (identifying the author of the study referred to, e.g.,  simulation model has therefore been developed to incorporate al the important features in the population dynamics [Potts, 1980) of non-integral citations, while agricultural economists preferred the naming function (the citation is a noun phrase or a part of a noun phrase signifying a text, equation, method, formulation or the findings of particular researchers, e.g., In this paper, the management in formation system (MIS) definition of Davis and Olson [1985] has been used.) of integral citations. Similarly, Harwood (2009, p. 501, 506) observed that computer sientists tended to use citations more for sgnposting purposes (directing readers to other sources, e., "In the frst method, AR coefficients were computed using X's method [3 references]"), while sociologists employed them more to engage the reader (identifying inconsistencies in source's position, e.g., It is striking that [name of source] also downplays the sig. nificance of these propertied x situations . [ee reference. As [name of source] notes, When I refer to the .,I am, by and large, referring to relatively small employers, not the wealthy owners ....' [reference].").

However, there is a dearth of research comparing citation choices between master's theses and journal articles. Master's theses are typicall considered as writing for supervisors and examiners, whereas journal articles are intended for a wider academic discourse community (Harwood, 2010). Those studies that have compared citation choices between master's theses and research articles have primaril focused onthe structure and function of citations, and their findings have en somewhat contradictory. For instance, Samraj (2013 found that master's student writers and published writers used citations for similar functions, while Mansourizadeh and Ahmad (2011) claimed that novice writers and experts used citations for different ones, with the former focusing on attribution and the latter on justifying claims. These somewhat contradictory findings warrant further investigation.

Hunston (1995) noted that allstatements in a written text are atrbuted to the writer f the text unles otherwise speified. Thus, in the hands of a skilful writer, authorship is typically clear and certain unless it is ascribed to another source. Coulthard (1994) emphasized the writers responsibilit to indicate who is making clams and to evaluate thetruth value of presented information. While citations are visible, certain aspects of their conveyed meaning are les apparent (Pecorari, 2006). Experienced writrs employ various forms of citations to serve diffrent rhetorical purposes and efectively support their arguments (Hyland, 199; Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011; Wette, 2017). However, citing behavior is subjective and influenced by writers perceptions, attitudes, biases, and knowledge (Liu, 1993). Malcolm (1987) further argues that the temporal positioning of numerous references to the research process resides solely within the minds and verbal/written discussions f the writers and the writers possess the flexibility to select a tense based on their rhetorical intentions in various situations. In specific situations, writers choose language forms, such as citations reporting verbs, or tense and voice of verbs, to fulill their rhetorical goal. These forms are connected to levels of \*generality or relevance or signal discourse functions like transition or foregrounding" (Shaw, 1992, p. 302).

In sum, comprehending and analyzing citation practices in academic writing is a complex task due to the influence of writers perceptions, attitudes, and rhetorical goals. Although a few studies have compared citation choices between master's theses and journal artices, their findings have been somewhat contradictory. To shed light on L2 students' citation use in MA theses tis study compares citation choices in literature review sections between master's theses and journal articles using a refined framework for citations.

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Corpus

To compare the use of citations in the iterature review sections of master's theses and journal artices in the field of translation studies, a corpus analysis i conducted. Analyzing academic text corpora can offer valuable insights into citation forms, atitdes, responsibilities, and functions in academic writing (Thompson & Tribble, 2001).

The student corpus consisted of 100 English literature review sections extracted from master's theses written by postgraduate students from five classes at a Shanghai universty between 2011 and 2015. Each clas consisted of around 40 students who were completing a specialized two-year program in translation studies. During their first year, these students completed coursework in translation theories, research methodology, general linguistics and pragmatics. In their second year, they were required to write an English thesis of approximately 20,00 words, which included setions such as introduction, literature review, theortical framework. methodology, results (discussion), and concusion, under thesupervision of their dvisors. Most thess focused on comparing ifferent versions of fictio or non-fiction materils translated between English and Chinee from a translation theoretical perspective. Although some theses integrated the literature review section with the theoretical framework or included it within the inroduction section, the literature review section was mandatory. The students would be awarded a master's degree afer their theses had successfully un. dergone a rigorous external examination and thesis defense. However, t is important to note that no grades were assigned to these theses. A total of 189 theses were collected from the five classes, and 20 theses were randomlyselected from each classto form the corpus. The students literature review sections were extracted from these theses due to their higher density of citations compared to other sections of the students' theses.

The expert orpus comprised 100literature review sections fromempirical rearch articles randomly selected from five prestigious international journals from 2011 to 2015 suggested by specialists in the field of translation studies, namely Meta: Translators Joundl (A&HCI),' Target (SSCI, impact factor ${ \bf \Phi } = 1 { \bf \Phi } .$ ), The Translator (SsCI, impact factor $= 0 . 7 4 4 $ , Perspectives: Studies in Translatology (SSCI, impact factor ${ \bf \Phi } = 1 { \bf \dot { \Phi } } .$ ), and Across Languages and Cultures (SsCI, impact factor $= 0 . 7$ ). Given that not all empirical articles in the field of translation studies feature an explicit subheading for literature review sections, nearly $4 0 \%$ of the expert corpus included introduction sections containing the literature review. Additionally, $1 0 \%$ of the corpus comprised both the introduction section and a separate literature review section. In cases where articles lacked explicit subheadings for literature review sections, we determined their in. clusion in the corpus based on statements within the introduction section that indicated the article's structural organization. For instance, we chose to incorporate the second section, tited 2. Theoretical background, from E03 into thecorpus, as indicated by the underlined statement below within the introduction section, which alluded to the presence of a literature review.

(2) The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 motivates the present study, giving an overview of related research on the law of growing standardization and providing some background information on Belgian Dutch. Section 3 presents an overview of the methodology used for this research and Section 4 provides the results of our research. Finall, in Section 5 we present our conclusions and some suggestions for future research. (E033)

The introduction sections of the empirical research articles were incorporated into the expert corpus due to their use of cited past studies to identify the research's niche and novelty, following Swales (1990. Consequently, the expert corpus can be effectively compared to the student corpus as they share similar rhetorical objectives (i.., convincing the disciplinary community of the validity of their research). Detailed information about the two corporais provided in Table 1, and the lis of the titles of the theses and the research articles can be accessed upon request.

# 3.2. A modified framework of functional options for cited information

To explore the pedagogical implications of asisting novice writers in citation practices, I employ Thompson's (1996) functional framework for language reports (refer to Fig 1) and adapt his four categories includig message, signal, atitde and voice to formulate my own citation analysis framework. This choice is motivated by several considerations. Firstly, Thompson (1996) approaches language reports functionally rather than structuraly, examining the interconnection of citations from a higher-level perspective (discourse) rather than a lower-lel one (structure). Additionall, the framework comprehensively covers ll available options for introducing language reports into a text, enabling the analyst to investgate the factors inflencing the choice of a particular option in a specific context. Moreover, the framework promotes a thoughtul and discerning examination of both writers own and authors texts, fostering a more nuanced understanding of academic writing. However, citations in academic writing are specialized and restrictive, featuring certain types of language reports unique to this context. Consequently, adjustments to his framework are necessary for the specific focus of the present study. This involves adding more detailed subcategories of functions of citations to make the framework more updated, feasible, and operational in the present study.

In Thompson's (1996) framework, the term \*message" pertains to the content of the reported language event, which can take the form of a quote, echo, paraphrase, summary, or omission. Since echo and omission are primarily associated with spoken language, I have chosen to include only quote, paraphrase, and summary in this category, with the adition of the concept of generalization as suggested by Hyland and Jiang (2019). There are various subtypes of quotes, including "fragment quotations," \*incorporated quo tations," \*unincorporated quotations," and "block quotations." (Kibler & Hardigree, 2017; Petic, 2012) Fragment quotations are defined as stretches of textual borrowing that are shorter than a T-unit (Borg, 2000; Petric, 2012). For example.

(3) Descriptions of tertium comparationis such as "a vital ingredient" (James 1980: 90) or the "most fundamental concept) (Krzeszowski 1990: 15) underline its importance in contrastive studies. (E001)

"Incorporated quotations" are essentially verbatim excerpts from the source that are longer than a T-unit and are seamlessly in tegrated into a sentence with quotation marks. They may also involve additional elements such as descriptions of the author or text, or a paraphrase that provides contextualization (Kibler & Hardigree, 2017). For example.

(4) Johnson once said In the 3 years since its publication, To Kill a Mockingbird has never been the focus of a dissertation, and it has been the subject of only six literary studies, several of them no more than a couple of pages long (1994, p. 20).(5013)

"Unincorporated quotations" are verbatim source excerpts that exceed a T-unit in length. However, these excerpts with quotation marks are not seamlessy integrated into a sentence, and they do not explicitly reference the author or text within the sentence where the evidence is utilized (Kibler & Hardigree, 2017). See the underlined parts in the following

example.

(5) In conformity of Schaffner's opinion, politicl texts itelf is a vague term which is an umbrella terminology involving variet of text types. Each of the various political text types has its own contextual, text-typological, pragmatic, etc. conventions and calls for different translation strategies.(Schaffer, 1997, p. 119) Researchers also fix their eyes on another phenomenon occurring in political text translation, i.e. special European context exerts profound impact on translation. (S100)

"Block quotations" are akin to un/incorporated long direct quotations, typically exceeding 20 words in length (Hyland & Jiang, 2019). However, they are presented in the text with indentation and without quotation marks. For example.

(6) readers/receivers themselves are an open, changing system, and so is the meaning of a message when it is undergoing the process of semiosis during reception, i.e. when becoming established as a semantic structure in the reader's mind. Jettmarova 2008: 4 (E006)

Both \*summary" and \*paraphrase" pertain to source information referenced through a single-source citation (Hyland & Jiang, 2019). For example.

(7) Other authors (e.g. Englund Dimitrova 2005:106) simply define revision as any change to the target text. (E100)

However, a paraphrase differs from a summary in the scope of the source material represented, i. summaries involve reduction while paraphrase includes asimilar level of detal as the source text. In accordance with the approach suggested by Hyland and Jiang (2019), I have chosen to exclusively utilize "summary" in the present study.

"Generalization' pertains to source information that involves multiple-source citations. For example.

(8) Only a handful of studies have focused on ST training, with an emphasis on European language pairs (e.g, Weber 1990; Martin 1993; Moser-Mercer 1995; Ilg and Lambert 1996; Agrifoglio 2004). (E016).

The term \*signal, as defined by Thompson (1996), encompasses linguistic cues or indicators employed by a speaker or writer to signify that a specific portion of language is a report. The characteristics and placement of these signals determine how the report relates to the surrounding text and the broader contex Thompson, 1996). Recognizing the influence of tenses and voices on language reports, I incorporate them as essential elements for specifying the \*signal' within both functional and structural options for cited information. Writers employ diffrent tenses, such as present, past, and present perfect, for temporal and rhetorical purposes when citing previous research (Hawes & Thomas, 1997; Lackstrom et al., 1973). Additionall, the use of active or passve voice serves distinct rhetorical purposes. For instance, consider the following example from Tarone et al. (1981): \*In this paper, we discuss an aspect of accretion disk structure which has never been adequately dealt with .. (toeger p. 216). Here, the first-erson plural active form of the verb is employed to reference one's own work, in contrast to the work of others, which is described in the passive voice.

Hunston (1995) emphasizes that attribution is crucial for implicit evaluation, and Thompson's (1996) \*attitude" category captures this aspect. This category in the modified framework mainly fouses on reporting verbs used by writers (i.e., reorters) to express their attitudes towards cited authors and information. Building on the work of Thompson and Ye (1991) and Thomas and Hawes (1994), 1 categorize reporting verbs into the writer's stance and the author's stance verbs. In terms of the writer's stance, factive verbs such as acknowledge demonstate, identify, prove, and sustntiate prset the author as conveying true information r acorct opinion. Onthe other hand, counter-factive verbs like betray (ignorance), confuse,disregard, ignore, and misuse portray the author as presenting false information or n incorrct opinion. Non-factive verbs, such as advance, argue, believe, claim, xamine, generalize, propose, retin ure, and utilize do not clerly indicate the writer's atitude towards the author's infomation or opinion. The author's stance rresents the attitude atributed to the author regarding the validity of the reported information or opinion, including positive verbs (e.g., accept, mphasize, i oke, ne, i er  ck, chllg, ss t, oe), n   ss x evaluate, fous on, tackle), andtenttive verbs (e, ald to suggest). By seeting specificrorting verbs, the writer can attribute an attitude to the source information as factive, non-factive, r counter-factive, and to the source author as positive, neative, neutral, or tentative.

According to Thompson (1996), 'voice" may be used to describe the atribution of responsibilit incitations in academic writing. To prevent confusion with the term voice within the "signal category, Isubstitute voice' in this dimension with \*responsibility." As noted by Hunston (1995), citations can transfer responsibility for conveyed information. Groom (2000) suggests three cases of propositional responsibility between the writer and the author in citation practice. The first case occurs when the writer assumes individual responsibilit for the proposition without citation. The second case involves the author assuming individual responsibility for te i ro rr t, Br 199] e r  toe [199], .  t h e, the witer and the author share responsibility for the proposition to varying degres. Three itation forms correspond to the shared responsibility case: in the first form, the writer has more responsibility than the author (equivalent to Swales' [1986] \*non-integral citation (information prominent), e.g., The moon may be made of cheese" [Brie, 1999); in the second form, the writer and the author have equal responsibilit e., as Brie [199 point ut, .) and in the tird form, the author has more responsibilit than the write e., Brie [199] points out that ..),corresponding to Swales' (1986) \*integral citation (researcher prominent). The integral citations in the third case diffr from those in the second case in terms of the reporting verbs used. For instance, the reporting verb 'argue is non-factive, whereas point out is factive (Hunston, 1995). To be concise, I divide "responsibility" into three sub-categories: the writer's reponsibilit i., non-ntral citatio, whr the writer has morereponsibilit than the author), shard reonsibilit i.. integral citation, where the writer and the author share equal responsibility), and the author's responsibility (ie, integral citation, Where the author has more responsbility than the writer. By integrating the elements of message, sigal, atitude, and responsibility, present the modified framework of functional options for citations illustrated in Fig. 2.

In summary, this citation analysis framework draws from Thompson's (1996) framework and extends it to encompass four dimensions: message (direct quotations, summary and generalizations), sigal (tense and voice), attitude (writr's stance and author's stance), and responsibility (writrs, shared and authors' responsibilities). While the dimensions generall operate independently, there may be some overlap or interaction between them, particularly between attitude and message (Thompson, 1996). The writers evaluation of the message or the author may influence how the message is presented or reported. Therefore, the attitude of the writer may have some influence on the way the message is conveyed, even though the dimensions are largely independent. Ths multi-dimensional model alows for a more nuanced understanding of citation practices in academic writing and offers valuable insights for assisting novice writers with their citation skills.

# 3.3. Corpus annotation and analysis

Both the students' theses and the experts' research artices employed the APA referencing style, allowing for the identification of citations through conventional signals such as author names and publication years (Hyland, 1999; Wette, 2017). In this context, citation refers to a resarch report that contains a specific rference point that can be easily identified. For instance, in Example 1 from the introduction section of this paper, the following sentence is considered one instance of citation: \*Wissmath et al. (2009) investigated the efects of dubbing versus subtitling on psychological immersion, asessed through the four measures of presence, transportation, flow, and enjoyment. This instance can be analyzed from its message (summary), signal (past tense and active voice), reporting verbs (non-factive verb investigate') and responsibilities (author-responsible) implied in the citation. Following Charles (2006), the extended reporting clause with that-complement is considered a distinct citation too, even though it does not include publication years as a component. In the same Example 1 from the introduction section, \*They found that the translation method does not have a significant influence on the participants' evaluation of the film experience' is identified as an instance of citation with extended reporting clause in the analysis. The citations involving multiple sources are considered an instance of generalization.

To annotate the two corpora, I manually annotated all itation categories using the UAM (Universidad Autonoma de Madrid) corpus tool (0Donnell, 2008) and applied the citation analysis framework depicted in Fig.2 as a coding layer. However, the dimension of options for itations, particularly in the attitudinal category, can be complex and ambiguous. For example, while Hunston (1995) categorizes claim' as a counter-factive verb because the author may believe the information is true while the writer may not, Thompson and Ye (1991) clasf it as non-factive. Hunston (1995) provided the following example to illstrate her categorization:

![](img/1141633677a135ce3ea75a2c577edde1d93e97d31d15a8d2d2b0110c67120e66.jpg)  
Fig. 2. Functional options for citations.

Soviet Union, and the East German State after it, always claimed that those interned at that time were Nazi war criminals, bu! former dissident Ben Offenheinitz's story refutes that. (p. 151)

According to Hunston (1995), the verb claimed is classfied as a counter-factive verb because the writer may not support the truth of the claim that the Soviet Union insisted on. In the annotation, I consider the writer's attitude towards the cited information to depend on the context in which 'claim' is used, and therefore, I categorize it as non-factive. For example.

(9) Liu Shisheng and Zhu Ruiqing (2012) claim that stylistics is the knowledge of stylistic research by means of linguistc approach. (S021)

In this example, the writer fail to provide a clear indication of her stance or attitude towards the authors' information or opinion (Thompson & Ye, 1991).

To ensure the reliability of the anotation, I re-annotated the corpora seven months afer the initial anotation. I analyed the data using a single-measurement, absolute-agreement, 2-way mixed-efects model. The resulting Intra-coder Correlation Cofficient (ICC) was 0.971 with a $9 5 \%$ confidence interval of 0.944 0.985, indicating \*excellent" intra-coder reliability (Fleiss, 1986). The UAM corpus tol provided tatistical reults and conducted a chi-quared tet with  st at 0.05. Additionall, I utilized AntConc (Anthony, 2019 to generate concordance lines for the reporting verbs and examine their frequency rankings.

# 4. Results

This section presents the quantitative results of the comparison between the student corpus and the expert corpus regarding citation-related choices. The analysis centers around four key dimensions: message, signal, ttitude, and responsibility. Through an examination of these dimensions, the objective is to examine whether there issignficant ifferce in cittion practices between the L2 masters students and the experts. Additionall, I aim to provide insights into potential areas for improvement in the students English academic writing.

# 4.1. Comparison of citation forms

A notable disparity in citation frequency was observed when comparing the student corpus and the expert corpus. The normalized frequency (per 1o00 words) of total citations in the student corpus $( \mathbf { M } = 1 0 . 7 )$ was significantly lower than that in the expert corpus (M $= 1 5 . 7 $ , as evidenced by the data presented in Table 2. In this study, the average number of total citations per 1000 words in the student corpus is somewhat similar to that in the discipline of applied linguistics $( \mathbf { M } = 1 0 . 8 )$ , as reported by Thompson and Tribble (2001).

According to the data presented in Tables 2 and it is evident that the students employed fragment quotations, incorporated quo tations, block quotations, summary, and generalization citations les frequently compared to the experts when demonstrating their understanding of the subject matter. However, the students used unincorporated quotations (71 instances) significantly more than the experts did (only one instance). Upon closer examination of the corpora, i became apparent that the students had a distinct approach to incorporating direct quotations in their writing, which differed significantly from that f the experts. While the experts typically integrated short phrases or fragments consisting of four to five words into their discourse (referred to as fragment quotations), the students often directly quoted entire sentences from the source material illustrated in Example 10). It is worth noting that the students' intention behind such incorporated and unincorporated direct quotations may primarily be for atribution purposes or protecting themselves against plagiarism (McCulloch, 2012), without making an efort to paraphrase or summarize the original information.

(10) As for practical translation, scholars from home and abroad have diffrent opinions. For example, Casagrande classifies the translation of scientific paper, government documents, or instructions, guidance and description in different languages on the package of products as practical translation.\*Shuttleworth, 2011:129) "Practical translation can be understood as: the translation processed in our daily lifeand industry, which includes translation activities in economy and commerce, military, diplomacy, science, engineering, conference and other industry.(Huang Zhonglian, 2013) Therefore, \*practical translation is a kind of pragmatic translation that takes spreading information as primary purpose and lays emphasis on the effect of information commission. The bigest feature is reflected that it istrongly pragmatic and widely applied, i almost covers all the filed of politics, economy, society, culture. JiaWenbo, 2004:1); Fang Mengzhi pointed out that \*Practical translation includes allof the words that people contact and use in daily ife, the words are involved in publicity, social life, production industry and trading activities, but not in literature or purely theoretic text.(2013:59) (s050)

In this example, the student heavily reles on direct quotations from the source material and neglects the use of paraphrasing or summarizing. Consequently, she strings together lengthy quotes, incorporating only a minimal number of her own words or even without any of her own words. This approach presents challenges in identifying the student's istinct stance and comprehending the discussion on practical translation within the literature review.

# 4.2. Comparison of tense and voice in the reporting verbs

The analysis of tense and voice usage in cited information, based on the student and expert corpora, reveals an expected patten with a significant difference between the two in terms of tense and voice usage (see Table 3).

In contrast to the experts, who utilized the present perfect tense $( \mathbf { M } = 0 . 4 6 > 0 . 2 3$ and passive voice $( \mathbf { M } = 0 . 1 > 0 . 0 4 )$ to a greater extent, the students demonstrated a preference for employing the past tense $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 4 3 > 1 . 5 6 )$ and the active voice $( \mathbf { M } = 7 . 4 1 > 5 . 2 4 )$ when discussing previous studies. This choicef tense and voice can be attributed to their reliance on citations where the cited authors are responsible for the information being presented (see Example 11).

(11) In Discourse and the Translator, Hatim and Mason (2005, 339) argued that the use of various thematic progression patterns is for the primary purpose of achieving certain rhetorical effects and that is one part of text organization mechanism which is rather important for translators; Liu and Chen held similar views with this in their researches. Liu claimed that what translator endeavors to reflect in translated text can be considered as the communicative effects brought about by thematic progression patterns of source text from more macroscopic perspective other than just patterns. (s025)

Example 11 llustrates that the student consistently presented previous studies or viewpoints with the author as the subject of the sentences, resulting in the use of active voice throughout. By employing the past tense, the student conveyed that these sources represent earlier literature and emphasized the subordinatio of their own voice within the text. In contrast, the experts demonstrated a more flexible use of tense in their reporting (refer to Example 1 in the introduction section of this paper) and employed the passive voice to highlight the cited information (see Example 12 below).

(12) As Toury admits, the choice is guided to a great extent by intuition with the aid of theories of text interpretation (Toury 1977: 100). (E040)

In this example, the expert provided a concise summary of Toury's statement, efectively drawing the audience's attention to the information through the use of the passive voice and non-integral citation. The writer has positioned himself with this expression.

# 4.3. Comparison of attitudes implied in the choice of reporting verbs

Table 4 shows that the frequency of reporting verbs related to citations is significantly higher in the student corpus $( \mathbf { M } = 7 . 4 4 )$ compared to the expert corpus $( \mathbf { M } = 5 . 3 2 )$ . A closer examination further reveals the disparity in the use of reporting verbs to convey ttitudes towards the proposition between the students and the experts

A significant difference in writer stance is observed between the student corpus $( \mathbf { M } = 6 . 1 4 ) .$ and the expert corpus $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 8 7 )$ , as evident from Table 4. Both student and expert writers tend to employ more non-factive verbs comparedto factive and counter-factie verbs when expressing their stance (Thompson & Ye, 1991). This inclination towards non-factive verbs can be attributed to the objective nature of academic writing, where writers aim to distance themselves from the reported proposition (Tadros, 1985). However, Table 4 highlights that the normalized frequency of non-factive verbs used by students $( \mathbf { M } = 5 . 3 )$ is significantly higher than that used by experts $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 0 7 )$ . This suggests that students prefer employing non-factive stance verbs to express their position on the cited information, relying on presenting the authors findings or conclusions rather than evaluating the cited information, a practice more commonly observed among experts (Hyland, 202; Thompson & Ye, 1991). The following two examples from the student and the expert corpora respectively demonstrate their different use of the non-factive stance verb 'claim':

(13) In 1995, the theory "Cognitive Translation Hypothesis" was put forward by Mandelbit, and he claimed that two mapping conditions, similar mapping condition (SMC) and different mapping condition (DMC), must be connected to achieve the translation from the conceptual metaphor perspective (Mandelbit, 1995). Peter Newmark voices his opinions on the translation from the conceptual metaphor perspective, as one influential scholar and metaphor is divided into six types: dead metaphors, adapted metaphors, cliche metaphors, recent metaphors, stock or standard metaphors and original metaphors (Newmark, 2001). (S010)   
(14) Style is notoriously vague concept, to the point that theorists such as Fowler (1996) claim it has no theoretical value and prefer using terms such as 'register', sociolect' and idiolect'. However, register' does not convey the character of individuality and subjectivity that is atached to style when the domain is a single text or a person, and idiolect failsto convey the creativity and motivation that are inherent to an understanding of literary style'. (E080)

In both examples, claim' is used as a non-factive verb. However, in Example 13, the student's attitude towards the cited infor. mation is unclear, because she only presents Mandelbit's conclusion. In contrast, in Example 14, the expert evaluates the cited information, and her attitude towards it is evident despite using the non-factive verb.

In terms of author stance, no significant overall dference is observed between the student corpus and the expert corpus $(  { p } = 0 . 1 9 8$ $> 0 . 0 5 $ I. However, there are noteworthy distinctions in how students and experts employ reporting verbs to convey their atitudes towards the cited author. The students express a significantly more positive attitude $( \mathbf { M } = 0 . 7 2 )$ towards the cited author compared to the experts $( \mathbf { M } = 0 . 5 4 )$ , while the experts tend to exhibit more tentative $[ \mathbf { M } = 0 . 3 2$ ) attitudes towards the cited author than the students $( \mathbf { M } = 0 . 1 6 )$

Additionally, the most frequent reporting verbs in the student corpus and the expert corpus were collected (see Table 5). The experts show a higher tendency to use verbs such as \*argue" and \*claim in comparison to the students. Notably, non-factive verbs such as "think" and \*write" are not employed by the experts. Table 5 further demonstrates that the students frequently use positive reporting verbs such as hold," "emphasize, "see," "advocate," "note," "insist," and "maintain," whil these positive reporting verbs are rarely used by the experts, with the exception of "note' (28 instances).

To summarize the findings, the students in this study demonstrated limited utilization of the evaluation function of reporting verbs in their academic writing, as evidenced by the atitudinal citation analysis of their literature review sections. They displayed a tendency to employ factive and positive verbs to convey agreement and show respect for authority, while employing non-factive verbs to obscure their stance towards the cited information, whether intentionally or unintentionally. In contrast, the experts in this study exhibited a propensity to provide more contextual information and expand the discussion when employing non-factive verbs, a practice favored by scholars across diverse disciplines, as highlighted by Hyland (2002, p. 16).

# 4.4. Comparison of responsibilities implied in the citations

The analysisof the data reveals distinct paerns in the citation choices etween the student corpus utilized by L2 master's students and the expert corpus employed by expert writers, s shown in Table 6. Specificall, the citation options inthe student corpus exhibited a higher degree of author responsibility (integral citations) $( \mathbf { M } = 7 . 1 6 )$ compared to writer responsibility $( \mathbf { M } = 3 . 3 3 ) \mathbf { \Omega }$ . Conversely, the citation choices in the expert corpus demonstrated a greater emphasis on writer responsibility (non-integral citations) $( \mathbf { M } = 8 . 9 2 $ compared to author responsibility $( \mathbf { M } = 6 . 1 3 )$ . These findings suggest that novice writers may struggle with effectively integrating source information to support their own claims (Wette, 2017). Additionally, it is noteworthy that the experts $( \mathbf { M } = 0 . 6 2 )$ showed a greater inclination towards sharing responsibility with the author compared to the students $( \mathbf { M } = 0 . 1 9 )$ . These results align with previous studies such as Charles (2006), who observed a preference for integral citation in master's theses, and Hyland (199), who highlighted the prevalence of non-integral citations in research articles.

The following example shows that L2 master's students in this study usually listed single-source citations to demonstrate their knowledge of the field.

(15) In addition, Wang Jianeng proposed to study the translator's subjectivity in the non-literary text, which promoted the development of the study of the translator's subjectivity. Tu Guoyuan and Zhu Xianlong studied the translators subjectivity from the perspective of hermeneutics (Tu, 2003, p.8). Xu Lai studied the translator's subjectivity from the perspective of feminism (L. X, 2004, P.16). Liu Guobing studied the translator's subjectivity from the perspective of translation ecology (G.B.Liu, 2011, p.97) Zhao Zhihua studied the translator's subjectivity from the cultural-sociological perspective (Zhao, 2011, p.82). Hou Linping and Li Yanni explored studied the translator's subjectivity from the perspective of evaluation theory (Hou, 2013, p.53)etc. (S075)

In Example 15, the student presented author-responsible citations in a sequential manner. This observation suggests that the student attributed the responsibility for verifying the truth of the statments solely to the authors. Furthermore it indicaes that the student lcked the abilit to efectively integrate these citations in order to make a cohesive clam. The student's approach in this example also reflects a lack of confidence and immaturity in presenting her own stance. Instead of engaging in knowledge. transforming practices by integrating the content as interpreted evidence to support an argument, the student resorted to knowledge-telling methods, treating the period and document content as discrete pieces of information. This finding aligns with research conducted by Bereiter and Scardamalia (1987) as well as Cumming et al. (2016) highlighting the importance of knowledge-transforming approaches in academic writing. However, in the expert corpus, writer-responsible or non-integral itations are quite common, as shown in the following example.

(16) Although different authors have claimed to provide evidence for this hypothesis (among others Overas 1998; Olohan and Baker 2000; Englund Dimitrova 2005; Espunya 2007), recent studies have questioned the universal status of explicitation. Some authors have even proposed to abandon translation universals altogether and the explicitation hypothesis in particular, especially where concerns translation-inherent explicitation (House 2008; Becher 2010b). Becher criticizes previous studies for using inconsistent definitions of explicitation or for not taking into account other interfering factors, such as the influence of the source language (Becher 2010a, b); House states that \*the quest for translation universals is in essence futile" (House 2008:11) Others do not go this far.

Example 16 demonstrates the expert's familiarity with the research area and their high knowledge-transforming ability to refine information from the source. The controversial issue in the fieldiscearly presented, providing the basis for the suggested research. The writers' critical attitudes towards the citations and their authoritative stance are explicitly demonstrated.

# 5. Discussion

The comparison of citation choices between the student corpus and the expert corpus by chi-squared test reveals significant dif ferences between master's theses and journal research articles. Firstly, the normalized frequency of citations in the student corpus is significantly lower than that i the expert corpus. This finding aligns with the findings of Thompson and Tribble (2001), who similarly discovered a lower density of citations in students' theses compared to experts research articles. The L2 master's students used too many long direct quotations in their literature reviews, and several long quotations (far eceeding 20 words) were usuall listed inthe same paragraph (see Example 10 above). This lack of integration of source knowledge to support their own claims highlights the students' inability to synthesize multiple sources and use generalization forms of citation effectively (Thompson & Ye, 1991).As Lee et al. (2018) noted, "L2 student writers have considerable difficulty in advancing their argument and supporting thir claims' (p. 6) through effctive synthesis of multipl sources. They might use citations for the purpose of attribution and create a favorable and positive impression on their audience by incorporating a large number of citations, as evidenced in the study by Fazel and Shi (2015) Despite incorporating long quotations, the overall density of citations remains relatively low compared to the experts' academic writing. Upon examining the student corpus, i is discovered that the students tended to include single-source citations as examples or sources to demonstrate their understanding of previous research on a particular topic (see Example 15 above).

The failure to provide their own perspectives ishighlighted by Petic (2007), who points out that student writers usually summarize a selection of studies without establishing clear links among them or demonstrating their relevance to the writers' own research. In contrast, experts employ citations for a range of rhetorical purposes, including identification, origin, and reference. Notably, they extensively utilize rference functions to guide readers towards additional information (see Example 16) and various grammatical forms in the reporting to imply their atitudes towards the cited information (see Example 1), whichillustrate the use of intertextual links (Samraj, 2008, p. 55), wherein the writers am to situate their contribution to knowledge within a larger disciplinary conversation by carefully selecting references to prior research. Through this trategic use of citations, they demonstrate their awareness of the existing literature and position their work as a valuable addition to the ongoing scholarly discourse.

Secondly, it appears that the L2 master's students in the present study lacked awarenessof the nuanced meanings conveyed by different grammatical forms of citations. They predominantly employed the past tense and active voice to present previous studies, without considering how different tense and voices can reflect their attitude towards the cite information. In academic writing, the choice of verb tense and voice is closely linked to the level of generality, relevance, and various discourse functions, such as signaling transitions or emphasizing important information (Hyland, 199; Shaw, 1992). For instance, tense serves a dual role, serving both temporal and discourse functions (Salager-Meyer, 1992). Present tense citations may convey a generalized interpretation and signal the writerscommitment to the reported information, while the present perfect tense suggests adirect relevance to the writer's own study (Hawes & Thomas, 1997; Hyland, 199). On the other hand, the past tense implies asense of detachment between the author and the writer (haw, 192). Upon close examination of the corpora, it becomes evident that the students adhere to a time-based tense rule (Hawes & Thomas, 1997), while the experts strategically employ tense for rhetorical purposes. This explains why students frequently use the past tense, as their litrature review section often serves descriptive purposes rather than questioning or challenging past studies (Salager-Meyer, 1992).

Thirdly, the present findings reveal a significant disparity in the frequency of reporting verbs related to citations between the student corpus $( \mathbf { M } = 7 . 4 4 )$ and the expert corpus $( \mathbf { M } = 5 . 3 2 )$ (see Table 4), despite the lower density of citations in the student corpus $( \mathbf { M } = 1 0 . 7 )$ compared to the expert corpus $( \mathbf { M } = 1 5 . 7 $ (see Table 2). This discrepancy can be attributed to the prevalent use of singlesource citations in the L2 students theses, as demonstrated in the aforementioned examples. Iti noteworthy that the novice writers may be unaware of the fact that the accuracy or correctnessof the cited information can be reflected through both the authors stance and the writer's stance verbs in the reporting (Thompson & Ye, 1991, p. 373). Altenatively, they may be aware of the implicit meanings asociated with citations but lack the expertise to effectively convey them by selecting appropriate reporting verbs. Moreover, the current data highlights the students' excessive reliance on their sources and their limited understanding of the importance of critical evaluation (McCulloch, 2012). For instance.

(17) ZhongWeihe and Zhou Jing discus the relationship between the translators subjectivity and loyalness to the original text. They state that \*translation can be regarded as a process in which the translator shift from displaying his subjectivity and keep his loyalness to the original text. The basic task of the translator is to convey the original content loyally. However, he can't be absolutely transparent and invisible in the process of translating and his translation is influenced by his own personality and style, which proves that the translator's loyalness is relative. Hence, the subjectivity and loyalness are of equal importance for the translator. The translator should consider these two factors when translating (Zhong & Zhou, 2006, p. 45). (043)   
(18) Englund Dimitrova (2005) and Malkiel (2009) explicitly comment on the way revisions were counted in their respective studies. Although Malkiel does not refer to the earlier study by Englund Dimitrova, their method is apparently the same, and corresponds to the one adopted in this study (see 2.4.2). (E100)

In Example 17, the student employed the reporting verbs "discuss" (non-factive writer stance verb) and \*state" (neutral author stance verb) to quote the argument of the expert, Zhong and Zhou, without providing any personal commentary. By using neutral stance verbs, which typicall objectively inform readers of the writer's position (Hyland, 2002), it becomes challenging for readers to discern the writers attitude towards the truth of the embedded proposition. In Example 18, although the experts employed the neutral author stance verb comment' to discuss the cited literature as wl, they clearly expressed their atitude towards the citations and effectively linked them to their own reearch by expanding the discussion of references, thereby fulfiling the citation's intended function as \*intertextual links" (Samraj, 2008, p. 55) within their article. These examples highlight the experts' confidence in pre senting their authorial stance in academic writing, which surpasses that of the students.

Finally, the findings of the present study reveal a contrasting pattern in the use of citations between the student corpus and the expert corpus, with the former prioritizing author responsibility and the later emphasizing writer responsibility. This observation aligns with the insights of Groom (2000), Coulthard (1994), and Hunston (1995) regarding the interplay of averral and aribution in written texts. Averral refers to unattributed statements, ad it i the writer' ronsibilit to indicate the status anddiscourse unction of different part of theext (Coulthrd, 1994). This i particularly signficant bcaus writers ber full resonsibilit for the validty of the proposition if they fail to indicate or signal this responsibilit. In the present study, L2 master's writers were found to evade their responsibility \*as the evaluator of the truth value of what is presented in the text" (Coulthard, 1994, p. 6). They seem to regard themselves primaril a iformation collectors and learners in the research field, rather than knowledge contributors. This sheds light on why the L2 master's students placed responsibilit on the cited authors rather than themselves as writers. This tendency is evident in their description of the purpose of reviewing previous studies, as indicated by the underlined parts of Example 19.

(19) This theis atempts to study Lin's Famous Chinese Short Stories in light of rewriting theory. Therefore, it is necessary for the author to read a great number of relevant references indicating previous research results, based on which the author will know the field better and generate valuable research result. This chapter mainly introduces and concludes the previous researches from three aspects: rewriting theory, Lin Yutang and Famous Chinese Short Stories. (s001)

# 6. Conclusion

The purpose of this study is to compare the citation choices in the student corpus and the expert corpus, from the dimensions of message, signal, attitude and responsibility, to uncover the implicit rule of citation practices. The findings indicate that novice researchers, pcifically 2 mastrs students, ehibit dstinct cittion practices that iffer from those of experts. The tend to use inglesource, author-responsible citations with active voice and past tense to present sources and examples. Consequently, their authorial stance often remains hidden due to their intentional or unintentional use of non-factive reporting verbs. Moreover, their direct long quotations lack necessary interpretations and fail to demonstrate intertextual links (Samraj, 2008; Thompson & Ye, 1991) L2 novice writers seldom employ citations o support their own claims, instead relying on attribution citations to atribute ids and information to other writers (Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011). Conversely, experts frequently use citations to provide evidence for their own claims and arguments and to highlight the significance of their studies. These differences might arise from the students' limited knowledge of the implicit evaluation associated with the choice of citation forms, reporting verbs, tense, and voice, as well as the cumulative knowledge and experience gained by expert writers over the years (Mansourizadeh & Ahmad, 2011). However,it is important to caution that the above inference is solely based on textual analysis, and a more comprehensive and nuanced conclusion could be reached through conducting in-depth interviews with both the students and the experts.

It is crucial to recognize that the experts' published research articles should not be employed as a yardstick for evaluating the writing of L2 students, iven that these two groups cater to distinct audiences. Additionall, even though this paper intentionally scrutinizes citations in specific sections (literature review sections) of thees and rearch articles, the findings may not be universally applicable to entire theses and articles. The absence of grades for the students theses introduces the possbility that weaker theses, lacking proper ctations,could impact the robustnes of the analysis. Hence, future rearch might consider selecting entire theses with higher grades from masterstudents to enhance validity when comparing them with experts research articles. Notwithstanding these various limitations, this comparative analysis can furnish novice 2 writers with insights into disciplinary citation conventions, aiding them in refining not just the mechanics but also the semantic and rhetorical aspects of their citations. Furthermore, this paper in. troduces a novel citation analysis framework, contributing to a deeper understanding of citation practices among both novice and expert researchers.

The present study holds significant implications for English for Academic Purposes (EAP) classroom teaching. The findings from the present study can provide valuable insights for the design and instruction of advanced academic writing courses. Firstly, the student corpus examind in this inestigation xhibited numeros mechanical err i citation usage Therfore, it i crucial to explicly teach L2 students the basic knowledge of utilizing resources in academic writing and to clarify the rules of citations. Secondly, citation is a complex phenomenon in academic writing as it encompases multiple intertextualities from writer, authors, readers, and texts, determining the acceptability and veracity of the writing while implicitly conveying atitude and evaluation. Hence students need to learn how to adopt approriate authorial stances, assume, share, or evade responsibility using different citation forms, and express their attitude or evaluation of the cited information through the choice of tenses, voices, and reporting verbs (Samraj, 2013).
