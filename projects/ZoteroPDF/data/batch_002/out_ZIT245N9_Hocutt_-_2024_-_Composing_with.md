This study introduces online advertising platforms as digital composing tools where persuasive rhetoric encourages users to follow links and take action on landing pages. It frames these platforms as digital spaces where human actors work alongside non-human AI agents (Duin & Pedersen, 2021 & 2023) and where rhetorical agency emerges through the activity of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It theorizes a (human) user-centered approach to composing digital ads in digital advertising platforms built around Walton, Moore & Jones' (2019) framework of positionality, position, and power. It provides guidance for technical and professional writers in placing human users at the center of an abstracted, algorithm-driven partnership where generative AI appears poised to wrest power from both composers and users.

# Introduction

Digital advertisements are ubiquitous on the web. Two prominent types of ads encountered are search ads and display ads. Search ads appear on search engine results pages (SERP), generally contain mostly text, and encourage users to follow a link i response to a search. Display ads appear on all kinds of websites and include some combination of imagery and text that encourages users to click to take an action, generall to make a purchase or to learn more. A major category of display ads is social media ads, which appear on social media plaforms, often (but not exclusively) embedded within users social media streams. Search ads appear on major search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Baidu, and Yandex, among others. Social display ads appear on major social meda platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp,  (Twitter), Linkedn, Pinterest, Reddit, TikTok and Snapchat, among others. On each search and social platorm, an ad-creating plaform is provided to enable advertisers to develop and deploy ads based on a number of user characteristics on the platorm, from search keywords (on search ads) to demographics (on search and social ads). Examples of these ad-creating platforms are Google Ads (https://ads.gogle.com/), Microsoft Ads (https://ads.microsoft.com/ for Bing), Meta Ad Manager (http://adsmanager facebook.com/adsmanager for Facebook and Instagram), LinkedIn Campaign Manager (htps://ww. linkedin.com/campaignmanager/), and  Ads (https://ads.twitter.com/ fr Twitter). On each platform, advertiers have the ability to write ad copy, include sill and video imagery (for display ads), and organize ads into ad groups and campaigns that advertise specific products to targeted users based on search terms and/or user demographics and browsing patterns. This study investigates these online ad-creating platforms as its object of study where rhetorical agency ocurs in the form of profiling audiences, writing ad copy, composing custom landing web pages, and deploying persuasive advertising campaigns.

Online ad-creating plaforms have incorporated machine learning and artificial intelligence into advertiser workflows. In a recent blog post, Jerry Dischler (2023), Google VP and General Manager for Ads, described the integration of Al into Google Ads as follows. "AI is foundational to Google Ads. For many years, it has been quietly helping in the background, supporting advertisers in maximizing their time and return on investment. In markting scholarship, reearch into the role of artifial intelligence in marketing has sen a tremendous spike that started in 2017 (Feng et al., 2021). Van Esch and Black (2021) recognized that artificial intelligence is having a profound impact on digital marketing, including a focus on creating \*content for campaigns' (p. 199). This focus on content, on the language and design of digital ads, is quite recent.

While Dischler's May 2023 announcement offers a useful timestamp for identfying astarting point for integration of generative-AI into digital ad design, doing so is not limited to Google. Meta (which includes Facebook and Instagram ads) announced its generative Al integration plans earlier that same month (Meta, 2023). LinkedIn launched its generative AI LinkedIn Ads tol a few weeks later in June (Sharma, 2023), and days later that month, TikTok launched it generative Al to0 (Agius, 2023). Late spring and summer 2023 appears to be the launch of generative AI for use by advertisers on these ad platforms. But machine learning and AI have been incorporated into these platforms for years, as noted by Dischler (2023) and Meta (2023) in Google and Meta blogs. LinkedIn's AI and Future of Marketing newsletter suggests that AI has been integrated into online marketing since \*the rise of the internet and e-commerce' in the decades of the 1990s and 2000s (Jasminara, 2023).

A month prior to Dischler's May announcement, The Financial Times reported on an internal presentation to Google advertisers that indicated the extent to which generative-AI would be integrated into it digital advertising platorms. \*According to the presentation, adertisers can supply creative content such as imagery, video and text relating to a articular campaign. The AI wl then remix this material to generate ads ased on the audience it aims to reach, as wellas other goals such as sales tagets' (Cridde & Murphy, 2023) And in July of this year, a New York Times article recognized how ubiquitous generative-Al had already become in digital advertising platorms, noting that in recent months, several large tch companies ncluding Meta, Google and Adobe, have announced artificial intelligence tools to handle that sort f work [developing ad campaigns with] variations lightly adjusted for different demographics" (Hsu & Lu, 2023).

The result appears to be that, while human-centered composing remains an important human-centered proces on these platforms, the work of composing digital ads has become, in part, a response to algorithmic suggestions, recommendations, and selections provided by generative Al. Composing ads in these online ad-creating platorms is a process of negotiating with ML-assted and AIgenerated recommendations for specific parts of online search and social ad copy, including headines, descriptions, call to action, keyword selection, graphic selection and inclusion, and audience targets. Missing from this process is a customer- or user-centric approach, one that focuses directly on meeting users' needs with specific rhetorical appeals. Centering advertising efforts on meeting users' needs to "satisfy, retain, and edify long term relationship. among their customers is the goal of multiple marketing capabilities (Sharma & Sharma, 2021, p. 13), including digital advertising.

Instead of the copywriter designing ad versions with audience personas in mind, then testing those ads over time toward optimization, the ad platform's generative Al does the work of creating ad versions and reports on the most successul combinations based on the optimized conversion action (like illing out a request for information form or making a purchase) selected by the advertiser. Put another way, ad writers are engaged in curating AI-generative copy and continue to compose segments of ad copy, but they are not directly engaged in manually deploying set combinations of multiple components to pecific audiences based on their understanding of those audiences. Generative Al does the work of determining which combinations of ad components wil perform best in agiven user's search results or social feed. The ad algorithm then deploys those combinations as ads, and collects data on user activity around those ads. Machine learning and AI then tests different ad component combinations to continue optimizing results. Only when reviewing ad activity results will advertisers and ad copywriters know which ad combinations were deployed, and which combinations were most successful.

In response, this project raises the following research question: What practices and strategies can ad copywriters incorporate into their work to ensure a user-focused, rather than Al-centered, approach to composing digital ads? To do so it trces the emergence of generative Al into online advertising platorms, details how generative AI is incorporated into ad copy composing platforms, and proposes existing and novel strategies that copy and landing page composers can incorporate into their practicesto maintain consistent focus on meeting user needs in ethical, just ways.

A note on positionality

This study hit close to my dail professional ife As the web manager on a higher education marketing and engagement team, I am responsible for managing online advertising campaigns for degree programs and non-credit professional education programs. Addi tionally, I'm a member of the two-person team who liaises with two external advertising partners that advertise additional under. graduate and graduate degree programs across online content, search, and social media platorms. As a result of my regular engagement in five advertising platformsMeta (Facebook and Instagram), X (formerly witter) LinkedIn, Google (search), and Bing (search)I'm able to contribute unique experiential insight into the role that generative AI plays in these advertising platforms. As a result of my dissertation study into the rhetoric of algorithms (Hocutt, 2019) and my more recent research into the role of infrastructure and data analytics in digitl literacy and technical communication (Davis et a., 22; Hocutt e al., 2022; Hocutt & Ranad, 2022), I'm challenged regularly to apply our field's audience-focused, justic-oriented aproaches in technical communication to the daily work of composing ad copy using these online platforms.

Having first-hand, insider knowledge and experience is useful, but being able to walk readers through the approaches I take, or hope to take, in my daily jobi both exhilarating and fearinducing. As a white isender heterosexual male with 25 years of experience as web manager, I work to kep myself kenly aware that my position is one of lifetime, hereditary privilege. My role as institutional rhetor for an elit private liberal arts clleas influences my copwriting, and  work hard t recognize that the audience for whom I compose ad copy are often lessprivilegd and less powerful than I, both personally and professonally as the rhetorical voice of our institution. Keen and consistent awareness of positionalit is needed when dealing with generative Al, for the algorithms that structure content, the machine learning than identifies patterns, and the AI that seeks to apply such knowledge of patterns to ad copy and placement, are constructed within systems that maintain the biases of their training corpora, coders, and enginers (Bender t l. 2021; Buolamwini, n.d.; Eubanks, 2018; Noble, 2018; O'Neil, 2016; Pasquale, 2016).

Given the importance of positionalit, it's also important to place this study within its appropriate disciplinary context. In general. the fields of technical communication and composition and rhetoric seldom call upon scholarship or expertise from the field of marketing communication to situate their research. Marketing communication and practice are often aligned with the practice of business communication within the field of business administration. However, as online content management more broadly, and the specific practices of content management more specifically, become aspects of technical communication curricula and training, these field barrers are becoming more porous (Flanagan, Getto & Ruszkiewicz, 2022; Getto, Labriola & Ruszkiewicz, 2020, 2023). My professional work regularl croses lines between marketing communication and technical communication, and I follow recent avice in my work to widen openings among marcomm and techcomm (Earley, 2018). For this reason, I'm presenting this advertising-centered approach squarely within the rhetorical framework of computers and composition, where the digital and the rhetorical meet head-on. Here, my rhetorical focus is on the persuasive composing of ad copywriters in Al-fueled digital platforms, an intersection of marketing communication, technical communication, and composition and rhetoric fields, disciplines, and practices.

# Literature review

# Composition & rhetoric

The field of computers and writing has a long history of encouraging critical approaches to digital composing. The goal of many such approaches i to provide research methods, pedagogical tools, and critical literacies and heuristics that enable and encourage using digitl ools for composing. As new digital composing tols have emerged over the past several decades, especiall as the Internet and World Wide Web have emerged as a curiosity, then a tool, and then a ubiquitous site for produsage (Bruns, 2008), scholars have researched those emerging tools and topics.

Generative Al and its use in digital advertising platforms is a narrow, contemporary niche where research has yet to emerge, especially among fields aligned with composition and rhetoric. However, research into digital advertising more generally has appeared recently. For example, Beck (2015) and Beck et al. (2021) address online digital survillance as it relates to digital advertising platforms, focusing on the role advertising plays in users online experiences. Swartz et al. (2020) report on engaging students from three different countriestaking clases that teach digital marketing with a goal of increasing intercultural awareness a clear indication that business communication classes include a focus on composing digital marketing assets and campaigns. Shefied (2020) focuses attention on the role search engine optimization (sEO) plays in digital marketing, inferring the connection between sEO and composing digital marketing assets. Rhetorical analysis of industry-related job ads is a favorite topic of analysis acros multiple dis ciplines and fields, including busines communication (Bennett, 2023; Brumberger & Lauer, 2015; Ding & Ding, 2013; Engstrom et al. 2017).

# Advertising and marketing

Beyond rhetoric-focused fields, a rhetorical (rather than psychological) approach to the persuasiveness of ads can be novel. Only sometimes does a focus on advertising as rhetorical activity emerge among other aproaches (s Labrador et a., 2014; Tevi & Koslow, 2018). In composition and rhetoric fields, rhetorical approaches are natural. And in this study, ads are considered directly persuasive. They require an understanding of target audiences. This necessity points to the value of any system that can narrow down its target audience and compose advertisements that resonate with that audience. In the digital realm, machine learning (Ngai & Wu, 2022) and invisible digital idntities (Beck, 2015) can be combined to surface aspects of target audience profiles to which ads can be customized. GenerativeAl ispredicted to have the ability to \*o nudge creative tass as required in the design of marketing campaigns" (owalczyk at al., 2023). In terms of this study, I sugest that crtive nudge comes in the form of matching machine-learned digital idntities with machine-leaned target audience profiles to recommend effective multimodal ad content that wil resonate with target audiences.

In our own fields, artificial intelligence is beginning to be incorporated into business professional, and technical communication workflows. etchell a l. (2022 offer a framework for understanding the role of arifial intelligence in business communication and introduce a number of research questions for scholars to consider as they explore this future of AI integration in businescommunication scholarship, pedagogy, and practice. One question they raise helps guide this study: \*How do communicative practices using the AI technology change over time, from first implementation to mature use or sunsetig of the tol?" (p. 23). In this study, the focus is upon AI-ssisted communicatie practice i dgitl advertising platorms, and the change that has occurred to more deeply integrate generative Al into the proces of digital composing ads. Recent work by Duin and Pedersen (2021, 2023) focuses on the partnering of artificial intelligence and human entities toward creative partnerships. This study focuses on the way generative Al has ben incorporated into online advertising platforms, which function as digital composing tools where persuasive rhetoric encourages users to follow links and take action on landing pages. I seeks to frame these platforms as digital spaces where human actors work alongside non-human AI agents to persuade users to take action.

# Framework

This study seeks to suggest interventions that digital ad composers can take when offered a"creative nudge y generative artficial intelligence in digital advertising platforms. In order to accomplish this it seeks a framework that can be applied by ad composers when developing advertising campaigns to mos effectively met the nees of customers. Recent specil isues of Communicaion Design Quarterly have examined communication, design, and writing infrastructure (Frith & Read, 2022, issues 2 and 3) because of "the agential role inrastructures (defined broadly) play in shaping practice and holding together-or not holding together-various parts of the social world" (Frith & Read, 2022, p. 5). This agential role is one played by digital advertising platforms and the generative AI embedded within them. This study uses the approach to writing infrastructure taken by Davis et al.(2022) in one of these special issues. That pproach is an application of the 3Ps (positionality, privilege, and power) framework introduced by Walton et al. (2019) Walton et al. (2019) present the 3Ps Framework as a methodology for surfacing inequities and prejudice that have been written into our everyday lives and for enacting socially just responses to dismantling oppression (Davis et al., 2022). The goal of applying this framework to composers' collaborations with generative AI as curators and managers of ad copy and aset combinations is to develop and present a heuristic that ad copywriters can use in building user-centric ads and landing pages with generative Al by examining how individuals and groups may be empowered and/or marginalized by the copy and visual assts generated by AI ssistants in advertising platforms.

It's useful to start by understanding how Walton et al. (2019) define the three Ps of the framework:

Positionality highlights the complexities of identities and the way that these identities are shaped by social context; positionality allows for understanding what diffrent identity markers mean as they are located in particular social structures. However, identities are not essential or determined by societ, but are \*fluid and contextual," shifig with changing circumstances (Walton et al., 2019, p. 63).   
Privilege emphasizes identities that are centered within society, focusing on how centering takes place. Walton et al. (2019) emphasize that privilege involves "receiving unearned social, cultural, economic, and political advantages' through "specific sociocultural identity markers (p. 83). It fixes upon identities that are valued, centered, and characterized as the norm against which those at the margins are judged. A position of privilege means that social structures are constructed to align with a certain normative perspective.   
Positionality and privilege determine if and how power is enacted in certain situations. An individual's identities and the social benefits attached to those identities indicate what paths to power are availale. Walton et al. (2019) conceptualize power "as a dialectical system where individuals and groups can enact change and as arelational, shifting system of positionality and privilege" (p. 115). Power i dynamic in this view, shifting as situations change. Power available to an individual or group is not the same in every context, and different identities render groups more or less powerful as they move through various situations.

These three Ps work together in this framework. Positionality, which is the location(s) of identities, and privilege, which represents advantages attached to specific identities, determine what kind of power can be enacted in different situations. Positionality and privilege are woven together in specific ways that enable or constrain power. Identities in digital advertising platorms can apply to both user-centric ad copy and author-centric copywriters. Positionality, privilege, and power can be revealed in authors dentties (i. e., composing ad copy in collaboration with generative Al) and in users identities (i., interacting with the ads authored by these collaborations).

# AI-Integration in an Ad platform

This study examines the way generative Al i integrated into the Google Ads platform from the perspective of an ad composer It does so by describing and llustrating the step-by-step proces in which an ad composer interacts with generative AI to builda sample search advertising campaign. This method copies text and provides screen captures from the Google Ads interface to llustrate the specific ways the generative Al has been embedded into the digital avertising platform. Whil this approach focuses atention on a single platform, the integration of generative Al into digital advertising platforms is hardly limited to Google. Similar processes and "creative nudges from generative Al are integrated into other search engine advertising platforms as wellas social media platforms. For the purposes of this study, Google Ads serves as useful common ground for studying a novel phenomenon because of its prevalence in the search engine market and the ubiquity of "googling" as a commonplaceactivity. By limiting this study to a single platform it necessarily risks focusing too closely on a single tool. However, my experience with multipl digital advertising platforms combined with the recent news releases from platform owners about Al integration indicates that usig asingle platform for an extended analysis can be applied more broadly to multiple platforms.

Fig. 1. A portion of the digital advertising ecosystem, focused on content flows.

Before launching into a guided demonstration, a brief description of how online search, social media, and advertising work together might be useful before advancing this argument. Ad copy composers write into an ecosystem of algorithms, machine learning, and content that seeks to match the interests and needs of users with goos and service available for sal. In order for this ecosystem to function, thre aspects are necessary: content indexing, earch, and ad copy and creative (imagery). This ecosystem (Frith and Read might term it an infrastructure, while Spinuzzi might term it a genre ecology) can be represented graphically, as shown in Fig. 1.

In Fig. 1, content from a webpage is algorithmicall captured by bots that index web content. When a user conducts an online search of any kind, the query is algorithmicall compared to the content index, where machine learning enables query terms to be rapidy relatd to indexed content. At the same time, the search query itself is mined for kewords, which are aloritmically compared to keywords for which the advertiser laced bids for placement on the search engine results page (SERP). The combination of organic search results (webpages isted in relevance order based on search query) and paid search results (adcontent selcted and sorted by its relevance to the search query and bidding amount) populates the sERP. While this study focuses on search advertising, a similar principle applies to social media advertising, where the \*content index' is represented by user profile and prior activity on the platorm, the "search results' are represented by an algorithmically determined matching score between the relation of the content index and the social media ad's target audience and content, and the \*SERP" is represented by the user's wall or home screen on the platform. A more detailed explanation of this process follows.

Content indexing and search

A rudimentary understanding of the way content indexing and search are involved in online advertising willhelp connect the activity of curating results (search engines) and feeds (social media) to the work of composing online advertisements. Search engines regularly deploy online webbots, sometimes called spiders, that \*crawl" open websites and index structured and unstructured content. Similar functions are at work on social mediaplatorms, crawling posts and indexing their content. This indexed content, tagged with metadata by algorithms and machine learning, becomes the massive set of data fields available to be matched with search keywords, terms, and phrases that are entered by users on search interfaces like search engines and social media search interfaces. When seaches are conducted, content and context signals like headings, subheadings, keywords, imagery, information architecture, and context are analyzed in milliseconds to determine the most relevant matches to search terms from among indexed content. The results are pre sented in results pages (SERP) on their platorm, which users can then select as most useful in answering their search query.

This connection between indexed content and search querie is the bedrock on which online advertising is built. On search engines. When indexed content is matched to search queries, the SERP lists relevant results from pages whose indexed content appears to align with the search query. Keyword matches between indexed content and search queries are particularly valuable, and search engine advertisers bid on product keywords likely to match user queries. Search engine advertising places n ad on a SERP when the keywords connected to a user's search query match the keywords on which the advertiser has bid; the order of ads on that page, unlike the order of organic results on the sERP, is sorted by keyword bid in descending order. Keyword selection is its own art and science that includes a component of rhetorical composing, but for the purposes of this argument, the ad copy on the sERP i the rhetorical composition this study seeks to analyze. The ad copy, comprising only a few lines of text once placed on the sERP, must do the rhetorical work of persuading the searcher to click the ad and follow the ad link to its destination, often a landing page designed with a singular or primary call to action (CTA).

Social media content

In social media, the processis similar but relies less on search results and more on curated feeds of posts considered relevant to the social media user. While social media often includes robust content indexing and search functions, the user's fed i the equivalent of the SERP. The feed is built around key context and content signals that rly on past and current user behavior to generate a curated collection of content, otherwise known as the fee. Here, resuls are not as clearly ordered by relevance, but by algorithmic machine learning that continually tets post content for is stickines and interest, measured using coll sped and pauses, vide views, reading time, likes, and follows among other signals. Posts deemed a closer matchto the usershistoric and current preferences receive pririty and appear higher on the feed. As in search engines, social mediaadvertising relies on developing ads that mimic the look and feel of other posts on the platorm (often called "sponsored content") and that match user's historic and current content preferences. In the case f social media ad copy, the ads, comprising both text and creative (imagery or video), are multimedia compositions thatseek to connect user preferences with products and services available for ale. Social media advertisers submit bids to get their ads placed on personal feeds by matching potential audience profiles in their advertising copy and bidding.

In both search and social media advertising platforms,composing persuasive ad copy that matches user preferences (in the form of search querie in search engines and profileaffinity in social media) with products and services being sold is a rhetorical activit that requires careful attention to the rhetorical triangle, to user experience, and to audience analysis. This places the composing of online ads quarely in the fields of technical communication and computers and writing, despite advertising itelf being relegated to the field of marketing communications.

Landing pages

Another composed component of online advertising is the landing page, the content to which online ads link. Landing pages are the products of conten trategists who see to connect the advertising copy on search engines and social media with the product orservice being described on the landing page. Ads succeed best on advertising platorms when a clear connection can be made by users between ad copy and design and landing page copy and design. Landing page copy i carefully composed to provide adequate detal about the product or service being promoted through ads while encouraging a call to action, often to make a purchase or to submit an inquiry form to request more information.

Composing landing pages is an important component of the online advertising process for several reasons. First, the rhetorical situation of landing pages and online ads should match. A user searching online for information about a product or service should receive ads that directly relat to that product or ervice, and any ad clicked should link to a landing page that directly relates to both the original sach terms and the text of the ad I lik fashion, a user scrolling through ther ocial media fd should se ds that relate to the users interests as expressed by prior scroll and click patterns on the plaform, and any ad clicked should link to a landing page that relates to those same interests and to the text of the ad. In whatever way we define the rhetorical situation (Biesecker, 1989; Bitzer, 1978; Vatz, 1973, ad copy and landing page copy, however brief, should correspond to each other in clear and specific ways. Second, algorithms and machine larning embedded in advertising platforms are deeply involved in the processof determining whether, when, and how highly relevant an ad will appear on a SERP or social feed. While a number of signals are evaluated in this automated process, one of the most important ignals is the apparent match among search terms insearch ads) or user profil in social media ads), ad copy, and landing page copy. The more often search keywords and terms that match a social user profile appear on a landing page and match terms in the ad copy, the more likely the ad willbe served on a given sERP or social feed.

Third, users must be able to clearly recognize the connection among their search terms or social profiles, the ads they are served While online, and the product or service described on the landing page. Lack of carefulattention to any one of these aspects of the advertising experience can render the advertising effort a spam-like annoyance to the user. Por profile targeting in a social media advertising platorm can serve irrelevant ads to users who may begin to question whether the brand promoting the product or service has a clear understanding of them as auser. Poor keyword selection and targeting in a search advertising platform can serve ads that dont clearly match search quere and cause the same isue wit users. Its likely we've all experienced some aspect of this disconnect during our search and social experiences-we generally encounter ads that clearly connect to our interests, but sometimes we encounter ads that make us question why and how they were served to us. In ad copy and landing page compositions,carefully attending to audience analysis can be the difference between a trusted brand experience and a les trustworthy brand experience.

# Generative AI

So far, this study has argued that composing ad copy in online advertising platorms for search and social media advertising is a rhetorical activity that require advertisers to attend to the rhetorical situation of the advertisement, its all to action, and it landing page destination. However, t's touched only briefly on the role generative artficial inelligence plays in the advertising process Like generative Al itself, this role has evolved over time and increased to such an extent that it's ubiquitously integrated acros online advertising platorms. This section of the study wil summarize this evolution and conclude with decribing the role generative Al plays in online advertising as of writing this piece. 'll use screenshots and descriptions from Google Search to illustrate this evolution, stipulating that other platorms like Facebook, Instagram, Bing, Linkedin, X (Twitter), and TikTok employ generative Al in similar ways.

The early role of online Ad copywriter

When I first started composing landing pages and online advertisements, the proces was rlatively static and straightorward. In Google Ads, the primary approach was to identify a set of positive (and possbly negative) keywords that matched your product or service, then write three lines of text: a one-line headine and a two-line desciption. The anatomy of those riginal ads hasn't changed much, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3.

Little has changed about the ad itself In Fig. 2 the headine is MI Professional Education - 12 Week Data Science Course" and the description is Rigorous Data Science Program for Professionals to build industry-valued skills. Learn Machine Learning, Dep Learning, NLP, Recommendation Systems, and more. Apply Now."

In those early days, a Google search ad consisted of a single brief title line (two hyphen-separated title lines are shown in Fig. 2) and two brief description lines (three period-separated description lines are shown in Fig.2) that were combined manually into a single ad. Multiple ads that combined the same or different title and description lines could be created and deployed in response to the same or slightly different keyword combinations, resulting in numerous similar ads bidding on simila or the same keywords for higher. relevance positions on the sERP. The closer the keyword match to a search query; the clearer the relationship among query, keywords, ad copy, and landing page copy; and the higher the bid on the keyword combination, the more likely the ad would be to appear, and appear higher, on the lis of ads on a SERP. In most cases, advertisers composed and combined the d copy, identified the keyword sets, and set bids manually.

While the advertising effrts were largely manual, the process by which Google matched ads with search queries and appended specific ads to SERP has always bee algorithm-centered. lgorithm-driven process that present search results to users in response to queries are involved in determining which, whether, and where ads are appended to the sERP. In the same way that algorithms determine the match between bot-indexed content and user-entered search queries to generate relevance-ordered organic results on a SERP, algorithms determine the match betwee advertising keywords, user-entered search querie, and bot-indexed content and, given an adequate amount bid on the keyword set, to generate relevance- and bid-ordered paid results on that same SERP.

The changing role of online advertising copywriter

Recent headlines, like The New York Times "A Blessing and a Boogeyman: Advertisers Warily Embrace A.I." (Hsu & Yu, 2023), CNBC's "How the Generative A.I. Boom Could Forever Change Online Advertising" (Vanian, 2023) and Types Digital's "Personalized Marketing at Scale: How Generative AI is Reshaping Online Advertising (2023), reveal ways that generative Al is poised to radically alter the advertiser-centered process of creating ads in online advertising platorms. Advertisers now play a far les conspicuous composing rolein developing ads, instead playing the role of curator and manager of AI-generated copy. This new role of copywriter as curator and manager of AI-generated ad copy is the specific focus of this study.

Rather than starting with a focus on target audience analysis along with keywords and actions users might take in response to ad copy, the experience of composing online search ads can now begin with your website. That is, given your company's website URL, more specifically the company's onlin catalog URL, the advertising plaform's generative Al will suggest alist of relevant keywords and propose components of ad copy (headines and descriptions) that can be combined algorithmically, in dynamic real time, as complete earch ads for which bids are automaticall set to ensure optimal exposure of the ad on relevant sERPs. This processhifts the focus of ad development and copywriting from the customer-centric approach of more traditional digital marketing efforts toward generative AI's content-centric approach of synthesizing and writing ad content.

Generative AI at work on Google Ads

What follows isthe step-by-step proces by which an online advertising plaform like Google walks advertisers through the process of composing ads. This proces reveals the extent to which generative AI plays a role i composing online search ads. While Google Ads is used as the plaform for llustrating this proces, both search and social media advertising platforms more generally are incorpo. rating generative AI in similar ways.

1. Provide a URL for your business.

a. The platorm reviews the account you're using and the URL provided to determine existing accounts that can be linked to the advertising account.   
b. According to the Google Ads process of creating an initial advertising campaign, linking accounts enables "faster campaign setup," noting that \*This saves you time by creating headlines and descriptions for campaigns" (see Fig. 4).

2. Set a goal for the campaign

a. Multiple goals may be available, including purchases, submitting an inquiry form to request more information, responding with a phone call to the business, viewing a specific page or product, or simply increasing brand awareness. b. These goals are considered conversions, representing auser successfully acomplishing the advertisement's cll to action.

3. Use AI to \*multiply your business results." In this step, the platform starts building ads using the help of generative AI.

a. The Al encourages ads to be deployed acros "Google's full range of channels including Search, YouTube, Display, Discover, and more" (htts://ads.google.com/aw/campaigns/new/performancemax). The AI also provides a real-time preview (mobile and desktop) of ad versions across the Google platforms (see Fig. 5).   
b. The AI rovides suggestions for 30-character headlines and encourages adding more (up to 15 total headlines). Headines serve as ad titles and are linked to landing pages (see Fig. 3).   
c. The AI provides sugestions for 90-character long headlines and encourages adding more (up to 5 total long headlines). Long headlines are used to describe the value proposition.   
d. The AI provides suggestions for 90-character descriptions and encourages adding more (up to 4 total descriptions). Descriptions are usually written to accompany and complement headlines.   
e. The AI prompts adding sitelinks to the ad (According to Google Ads, A sitelink shows additional links in your ad that take people to specific pages of your website. People can then click your links to go directly to what they want to know or buy." https://ads. google.com/aw/campaigns/new/performancemax)   
f. The AI recommends an automated call to action, \*which allows Google to automatically chooe the most relevant call to action for you" (https://ads.google.com/aw/campaigns/new/performancemax).

Once setup is complete,rather than creating multiple versions of an ad based on varying headlines and descriptions manuall, the platform offers to dynamically generate ads that are personalized to user preferences and searches by combining headines, descriptions, and other components of the ad in real time in response to user search queries. In other words, rather than manually generating multiple versions of ads, running those ads to evaluate performance, and developing new ads built around the model of those ads that are resulting in the most productive activity-the platorm does this optimization work using machine learning, then relies on generative AI to deploy the most successful ads at optimal settings.

As an online advertiser, itsdifficult to quantify the seachange that generative Al-driven dynamic ad generation has made in the process f updating and optimizing ads based on user actions. As noted in the introduction, audience analysis and understanding users has shifted from the domain expertiseof subject matter experts and technical communicators and ad writers to the domain of machine learning algorithms and generative Al. Ad writers curate collections of machine learning-generated suggestions to build advertising

campaigns and ad sets.

Getting into the weeds is perhaps the clearest way to llustrate the extent to which generative Al i involved in ad deployment and results. sing actual reuls from a responsive ad currentl running for a GIS Professional Crtificate, ll demonstrate how generative AI reports its activities to advertisers.

As noted earlier, a responsive ad requires only the components of the ad, not manually selected combinations of those components. In the reporting dashboard, this is revealed as shown in Fig. 6.

Following the View asset detail' link in Fig. 6 reveals that these headlines and descriptions have been combined and deployed as ads for the Online GIS Professional Certificate program in 743 diffrent combinations in the previous 90 days (see supplementary material for the fullis of combinations and results, ordered by impresions). Allof these combinations were created and deployed dynamicall as sponsored ads on SERPs for keyword searches related to the GIS program, optimized for anticipated individual user responses, through the plaform's generative Al. Only by reviewing these results sfter ads are deployed do ad writers become aware of the way headlines and descriptions have been combined as search ads on user's sERPs. In other words, ad writers don't generate ads themselves; they combine their effrts with generative AlI to create ads that are constructed dynamically, in real time, ostensibly targeted to the users conducting online searches. Advertiser audience analysis and insights into users dont overn the creation of these ads; Google's Al governs their creation and deployment, with ad clicks and conversions the primary method used to determine successful fulfillment of user needs.

# Generative AI as composer

There are two primary results of this analysis. First, the online ad platform has clearly integrated generative Al into severa stages of the ad creation process. The generative Al starts by asking the ad writer to select an initial web landing page or catalog as a small training set. From there it suggests ad keywords for bidding, recommends conversion goals, and proposes ad copy (titles and descriptions). Second, ad composers who work in online ad platforms like Google Ads wil be expected to partner with generative Al in composing ads, and will need tools and frameworks to guide them toward human-centered composing practices.

Ad composition and generative AI

This presentation of Google Ads integration of generative Al into the processof composing ads reveals the reality that generative AI is, and will continue to be, integrated into writing and deploying online advertisements. In these early days of integrating gnerative AI into online advertising platorms (as I write this, it's been only four months since Meta and Google made their announcements), the responsibility of composing ads appears to be shifting from the human writer to the AI asstant. The copywriter's responsibility appears to be shifting toward curating and providing oversight over Al-generated copy and visual assts, and perhaps toward reviewing results to ensure that AI-generated ads are depicting products and services truthfully.

Digital composers have engaged with machine learning and AI for years, so integration of generative Al into digital composing doesn't come as a shock. Search engine optimization (SEO) is a common composing activity that engages algorithms and machine learning to ensure composed webpage content scores high on relevance searches for keywords (Killoran, 2010; Shieffield, 2020). SEO relies on a particular kind of writing for the web that chunks content, includes likely search keywords, tructures content efectively, and includes strong, relevant keywords and other metadata. Digital composers seek to know their audiences well enough to predict with some accuracy the search terms that users might commonly use when searching for content. Writing with sEO in mind ensures that their composed content and metadata are "understood' by machine learning algorithms so matches ocur between indexed content and search queries, resulting in webpages that get listed as high as possible on the search engine results page (SERP)

Generative Al, however, brings new challenges to digital composers. Where SEO encourages human composers to write in specific ways that ensure that machine learning matches indexed content to search terms, generative Al offr to offload audience-focused aspects like content writing and selection to algorithm-driven process. In the extended example above, itappears that providing a website or catalog URL to the generative AI employed in the Google Ads platform can result in the platform building out an ad based solely on the content of the website. Human intervention in the proces is only truly necessary if the AI goes ff track or doesnt have adequate information to fillall of the parameters. As a result, the specialized writers who compose ads need support to deploy generative AIl cross avertisements and landing page experiences to provide critical analytical oversight to th language and activities of ads on networks. This study offers one possble means of support; many others will be needed. Here I fcus specifially on the importance of ensuring that generative Al doesn't fabricate, obfuscate, or reinforce biases that exist either in training sets or websites and landing pages used as source material for generating text and image suggestions. I do this by incorporating the three-Ps framework of positionality, privilege, and power introduced by Walton, Moore and Jones (2019) into the composing, curation, and oversight activities of ad copywriters working with (and perhaps sometimes against) generative AI.

One way to support ad composers i to provide a framework, built around Walton, Moore and Jones' (2019) framework of positionalit, privilege, and power, that helps composers deploy ads that avoid, or at least imit, abuses of positionality, position, and power among ads and accompanying landing page experiences. This framework, as noted earlier, fers a methodology for surfacing inequities and prejudices that have been writte into our everyday lives toward enacting just responses that help dismantle opression. There are at least three areas of the ad platform's generative Al integration to which this framework can be applied.

1. Understanding the Generative AI Assistant. Generative Al doesn't exist in a vacum. Its training datasets and large language models embed within them normative social assumptions, and the AI's relations to the product or service being sold likely bring biases into the text and imagery recommended by the Al. Similarly, the web landing page or catalog used for training the AI on the specific products and services being advertised is a composition whose assumptions and biases may also be embedded into the AIgenerated results. 2. Curating Generative Al Suggestions. Generative Al will suggest copy for ads. These suggestions will be based in part on infor mation it receives from the copywriter, like a website URL or a starter set of keyword recommendations. However, these su. gestions willalso incorporate everything the AI 'knows" (in terms of training datasets) about the advertised products and services, including normative values programmed algorithmically and embedded in cultural production. 3. Evaluating Generative AI Ad Combinations. In the examples provided in the Methods section of this study, advertisers are responsible for tracking the performance of dynamic ads that are ML and AI generated. Copywriters can intervene during this time of reflection, examining both strong and weak performing combinations using the 3Ps framework.

In the Discussion section that fllows, I'l connect specific portions of the Google Ads ad building workflow to these areas and demonstrate how a heuristic application of the thre-Ps framework can enable ad composers to intervene toward more humancentered composing practices.

# Results and implications

To shift thistudy from an auto-ethnographic, illustrated demonstration of the generative Al tools integrated into the Google Ad platform, I've grounded this study using aframework for surfacing and addresing inequities and prejudice that may have been written into the ad copy composed by generative Al. I position this study as an extension of research into digital composing practices in marketing and advertising, focusing particularly on the rhetorical perspective of ad composition as persuasive writing.

Setting up the 3Ps framework

In the illustrated demonstration of generative AI tol, the generative Al in Google Ads steps ad composers through several actions. These actions map to recommended focus areas for applying the 3-Ps framework as shown in Table 1.

As seen in Table 1, two steps in the Google Ads creation proces map to a single recommended area for applying the 3-Ps framework, while two other steps map directly onto specific framework application recommendations. This is caused by the ad platform's direction to allow the AI to recommend a conversion goal for the ad campaign. Conversion goals (like inquiry acquisition, website visit, ap download, or purchase) are generally set by the advertiser; however, the generative AI makes suggestions based on the content of the web landing page or online catalog and its dee understanding, powered by machine learning, of user actions on websites.

The 3-Ps framework addreses thre areas where inequitie can be surfaced: positionalit, privilege, and power. Starting with areas of 3-Ps framework application listed in Table 1, heuristic questions can be applied to the generative Al's step of ad creation toward ensuring a human-centered ad composing. These mappings are shown in Table 2.

Digital advertising creates a number of different ads that use different ses of keywords to ensure placement for different target audiences. Because of this reality, the best method of deploying this heuristic is during ad creation rather than afer the ads start running. However, to demonstrate the value of applying the 3-Ps framework to generative Al integration into digital ad platforms, the GIS campaign referenced in the previous section can be used to analyze the third area of application, \*Evaluating Generative AI Ad Combinations." As a reminder, the supplementary material provides the fullset of opy combinations. For this analysis, only the top performing combinations, measured using impressions, will be used. They are listed in Table 3.

Using the generative AI ad combinations shown in Table 3 as a guide, the following analysis uses each item in the 3-Ps framework to evaluate the combinations. A single response is provided for each heurisic question to model the analysis, but these responses should not be considered comprehensive.

The process of applying the 3-Ps framework starts by directing the positionality-related heuristic questions to the Al-generated ads.

# Positionality

Heuristic question 1: Does the AI generate ad combinations that don't make logical sense?

In reviewing the five ad combinations in Table 3, it appears that ad $\# 4$ provides little connection between Description 1, "Earn a GIS Professonal Certificate online and apply GIS skill in your current workplace," and Description 2, \*Enter the GIS field by earning aGIS Professional Certificate onlin from U Richmond. Because these two descriptions are so closely related, differing mostly in specifying or not specifying an institution, they don't make sense being included in the same ad. Yet because the ad writer has ittlecontrol over the combination of ad copy, the two appeared together 328 times in the 90-day period measured in Table 3. This relates to positionality because it doesn't take into account the user's perspective on the topic, unnecessarily repeating details in the ad copy.

Heuristic question 2: Are there combinations that reveal the shortcomings of the generative AI's knowledge and understanding of

users or the products and services being advertised?

In reviewing the Al-generated ad combinations in Table 3, an issue related to unexplained abbreviations emerges in all but ad $\# 2$ The ad copy assumes "U" is understood as "Universty" in "U Richmond." Search terms and keywords likely used the more common abbreviationGIs," so including that abbreviation makes sense. But understanding " assumes a high lel f learning and experience from the ad's audience.

# Privilege

Heuristic question 1: Does the performance of AI-generated ad combinations reflect a normative reality?

All five of these top-performing ads reveal that les may be more. Heading 3 is not used in any of these ads. Up to three headings can be used in an ad, but the Al determines whether target audience users will or willnot resonate with a third heading. Performance in terms of impressions for these top five performing ads suggests that they do not.

Heuristic question 2: Has ad performance (in terms of impresson metrics) reinforced normative values? Or revealed (in terms of performance) traditionally underserved user identities?

All ut one ad listed in Table 3 includes a reference to U Richmond. Since these ads are being run by a school of UR, it makes sense that the reference is used in ad copy. However, the fact that these top performing ads include U Richmond may suggest something about the educational level of users, likely those who would be familiar with universities ofering professonal (noncredit certificates. Additionally, the ads target currently employed users by using terms like \*workplace." The same Description 1 is aplied to each ad, suggesting that decription is important, either to the advertiser, who may have inned that decription in that spot, or to users who viewed the ad. Importantly, the ads do not target unemployed or underemployed workers. This demographic reality may be built into the ads themselves based on ad composer intervention, but it could also represent a digital divide in the audience.

# Power

Heuristic question 1: In the ad combinations shown, are there obvious examples of combinations that demand specific actions from users?

Imperatives like "earn" and learn" and \*apply" demand action from users; however, the action doesn't match the goal of the ad. which is aclick to a landing page. The voice of the d is invitig but tere. Rhetorically, it exerts power in its mperatives and from its connection to the University of Richmond as provider of the educational opportunity.

Heuristic question 2: Are there specific user identities that appear to be targeted by imperatives that emerge from certain combinations of text assets?

The target of these ads appears to be users outside the GIS industry or professon. Assumptions about that target would be too general tobe useful. Targeting those who lack GIS experience but who understand abbreviations like GIS" and U Richmond" suggests that targeted identities have the agency to make a career change. Given the high price point of the advertised product (over $\$ 3000$ , it's clear these ad combinations target an affluent, educated, working-age segment of the population.

# Implications

What the 3-Ps framework fers ad writers is an approach to critically examining the extent to which positionality, privilege, and power play a role in Al-involved ad creation. The framework can be applied just as easily to human-generated ads and ad component combinations as to AI-generated copy and combinations. However, the partnership between human and AI in the ad creation and evaluation proceses combined with the black-boxed and unrevealed activity of generative AI requires the formal, thorough critical analysis of this framework.

This discussion closes with a hope that demonstrating how the 3-P framework points attention to the rhetorical choice of human composers collaborating with generative Al offers insight into ways ad composers can influence AlI to compose human-centered ads.

# Conclusion

Limitations of study

This approach, a deep dive into an online advertising platform, and its object of study, the Google Ads platorm and its newly integrated generative artificial intelligence, reveals significant limitations. By focusing on a single platform, it risks specialization rather than generalization. y studying an early integration of generative Al into an online advertising platform, it riss becoming quickly irrelevant as the technology improves. By basing this study on my professonal experience, it riss becoming auto-ethnographic without adequate theoretical grounding.

However, what I hope this study offers is an intial foray into the kinds of interventions digital advertising composers willneed to effect as partners with generative Al in ad composing. Specific practices will be needed to effectivelytrain generative Al on landing page content and retain a human-centered focus on ad copy as generative AI offers sugestions based on its understanding of the products and services being advertised and the target audiences who seek these products and service. Those practices will require dedication to the hman audiences advertisers eek to serve, especiall as generative Al sees to wite copy built aound ts acquisition and analysis of large language models and training sets.

Addressing research questions

The study set out to answer this research question: What practices and strategies can ad copywriters incorporate into their work to ensure user-focused, rather than AI-centered, approach to composing digital ads? The study shows that ad copywriters can apply the following practices and strategies to ensure human-focused ads are generated.

1. Pay careful attention to content and cultural asumptions embedded into the smalltraining set of a web landing page or online catalog when interacting with the digital advertising platform's generative AI.   
2. Ensure that the conversion goals recommended by the generative AI represent human-centered goals that benefit users.   
3. Carefully curate the platform's multilied busines results (ie, Ignerated text copy asets to ensure they honestly reflect the products or services being advertised and equitably target users.   
4. Review automatically generated ads to be sure that text combinations are clear, uncontradictory, and appropriately targeted.

To guide these practice, the 3-Ps framework of privilege, positionality, and power (Walton et al., 2019) can be applied.

The intervention presented in this study, a heuristic for ad copywriters, is modest and incomplete. However, the 3-Ps framework offers a useful sarting point to engage ad copywriters in aprocess of systematically and critically analyzing the composing results of generative Al. As AI continues to improve and become even more ubiquitous in online advertising platforms, this heuristic will need to be upgraded and improved. It's hoped that the field of computer and writing will rflet on this heuristic, applied to an understudied area of composing, and consider ways it might be aplied across other areas f composing where generative Al is being implemented.

As has always been the case in the field of computers and writing, the goal for composers is to place human users at the center of their efforts. Centering users and their needs becomes far moredifficult in the abstracted, algorithm-driven partnership of online adertising platforms, where generative AI appears poised to wrest power from both composers and users. By centering human users in human/AI composing partnerships, ad writers can combat the potential de-centering forces of machine learning and generative AI. Such agents are trained on massive culturally decontextualized datasets that tacitly reinforce (at est) or actively perpetuate (at worst) technology-focused audience perspectives. Applying the 3-Ps framework to collaborative human/AI ad composing helps combat potentially unjust treatment of audiences.
