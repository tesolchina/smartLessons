# ABSTRACT

The Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction (ARCS) model provides a basis for integrating motivational dynamics and technological affordances into the design and implementation of instructions to maintain learner motivation and interest. Little attention has been paid to this potential in teaching the complex and often demotivating skill of second/ foreign-language (L2) writing. This study examined synergistic effects of ARCS-flipped teaching on Iranian English-as-a-foreignlanguage (EFL) learners’ expository-writing performance and motivation. Participants were 59 EFL learners in two intact classes who were assigned to two groups. In the experimental group, the ARCS model was integrated into the flipped writing course. Hybrid Edmodo plus face-to-face learning spaces were used to implement ARCS strategies alongside the instruction. In the control setting, the model was implemented in the face-to-face writing course. A data-triangulation approach, comprising writing tasks, the Course Interest Survey, and semi-structured interviews was adopted. ANCOVA results showed that the ARCS-flipped group outperformed the face-to-face group in their writing performance. Furthermore, the motivational-technological synergy led to more increased learner motivation. Learners’ retrospective perceptions revealed that the flipped features of flexibility, learner-centeredness, relaxed environment, interactivity seamlessness, and collaboration appealed to the learners’ varied time-space preferences, which, in turn, stimulated their motivation, learning engagement, and writing performance.

# 1.  Introduction

Recently, the central theme of a growing body of writing research has been how to instigate and sustain L2 writing motivation during the language learning journey, at large, or even during a specific writing course (e.g. Chen, 2021; Tahmouresi & Papi, 2021; Yu, Jiang, & Zhou, 2021). L2 (writing) motivation plays a vital role in identifying the direction and the fortune of individuals’ writing processes by impacting the particular choices of goal-oriented actions they make as well as their investment, engagement, and persistence with the writing task (Dörnyei & Ryan, 2015; Waller & Papi, 2017; Wu, Yang, Chen Hsieh, & Yamamoto, 2020). When low motivation is implicated, writing is perceived as the most challenging proficiency aspect or skill to develop (Wu et  al., 2020). Typically, expository writing is a widespread yet complex genre of (academic) writing through which writers introduce a topic or a viewpoint and proceed to support the topic with factual data or evidence through explanation, persuasion, argumentation, and compare or contrast (Beers & Nagy, 2011; Jeong, 2017). Despite its centrality to academic literacy and success, learning expository writing is a highly time-consuming, challenging, and, sometimes, demotivating task for L2 learners. The poor quality of written expositions of most students, in both L1 and L2 (tertiary) educational contexts, has been a matter of serious concern over the last decades (Chen, Smith, York, & Mayall, 2020; Paul, Lin, Ha, Chen, & Newell, 2021).

In order to make L2 learners motivated, effective expository writers, it is felt that a more principled, integrative approach is needed which allows for not only innovative pedagogies but also supportive frameworks for stimulating and maintaining learner-writers’ motivation (Jang & Lee, 2019; Wu et  al., 2020). Nowadays, with the support of various information-and-communication technologies (ICT) and the prevalence of ‘emergency remote teaching (ERT)’ after the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Can & Silman-Karanfil, 2022), L2 classrooms have increasingly adapted, in whole or in part, to virtual environments-on-the-move beyond the classroom walls to extend learners’ experiences, perceptions, and actions (Dooly & Sadler, 2013; Song & Ma, 2020). Flipped teaching/ learning is one of these innovative technology-enhanced frameworks proposed to blend actual, face-to-face classrooms with extended online platforms for the effective use of class time, interactional affordances, content-rich learning experiences, and active learner participation (Adnan, 2017; Mettis & Väljataga, 2021). Studies of flipped teaching in different L2-learning environments have pointed to favorable effects for technology infusions in developing L2 skills, including writing (e.g. Su Ping, Verezub, Adi Badiozaman, & Chen, 2020; Zou & Xie, 2018). However, there is still one major concern inherent in this technology blend, namely, whether flipped teaching can by itself help regulate learners’ motivational ebbs and flows and ensure active engagement (or interest) in writing in the long run (e.g. Keller, 2016; Nicholes, 2020; Wu et  al., 2020). Relevant research has already echoed the concern that the novelty effects of ICT innovations can vanish rapidly (e.g. Keller, 2016; Nicholes, 2020), or, simply, may not be taken up by learners (Lamb, 2017), if they do not allow for complementary psychological dynamics to stimulate learner motivation. In this regard, Nicholes (2020) notes that future flipped research should no longer focus on ‘whether or not’ flipped teaching can improve EFL learning achievement but on ‘what kinds’ of flipped teaching designs can instill motivation in learners and foster their engagement with flipped materials or activities.

To address a similar concern, Keller (2010, 2016) proposed ARCS-motivational model, as a built-in instructional design and practice feature to ensure that the technology-enhanced (flipped) courses improve learners’ motivation or interest (e.g. Li & Keller, 2018; Min & Chon, 2021). According to Keller (2010), ARCS dynamics are incorporated as design processes, practice dimensions, and problem-solving mechanisms from a designer-clinician’s diagnostic perceptive. This is, in effect, the main feature of the ARCS model which makes it suitable for this purpose and, in turn, distinct from other models of motivation, such as Gardner’s (e.g. Gardner & Lambert, 1972) socio-psychological perspective or Dörnyei’s (2009) L2-motivational-self system, that conceive of motivation as individuals’ orientations or self-guides from a merely conceptual standpoint.

Incidentally, Iranian EFL learners largely encounter considerable complications learning rhetorical, organizational structures of different expository-writing sub-genres. EFL education in Iran has been rather slow to respond to learners’ writing-motivation issues and to the inclusion of ICT-motivational frameworks to complement instruction design and classroom practices, especially before the COVID-19 pandemic. Even with the widespread use of ICT-based ERT classes after the pandemic, emotional problems such as boredom and lack of engagement prevail among EFL learners exacerbating the situation (Derakhshan, Kruk, Mehdizadeh, & Pawlak, 2022). Examining the notion from Dörnyei’s (2009) L2-motivational-self approach, Tahmouresi and Papi (2021) concluded that, while L2-writing-motivational selves positively predicted learners’ writing achievement, Iranian EFL learners’ display of low L2-writing motivation probably emanated from the lack of relevant engaging learning experiences in and outside the classes. The need, therefore, remains to explore the innovative Edmodo-based, ARCS-flipped synthesis in L2-writing classrooms in Iran, especially given the boredom or demotivation issues prevalent among L2 students in the wake of the pandemic.

# 2.  Theoretical background

# 2.1.  Flipped L2 classrooms: theory and research

The notion of flipped teaching might not be something new, but it has surely been given fresh impetus in recent years in the wake of momentous ICT advancements and globally enhanced access to computers and mobile devices (Davies, Dean, & Ball, 2013). In a flipped classroom, by definition, what was traditionally conducted and managed by the teacher in class is now done in a student-centered learning environment at home, and what was traditionally assigned to students as homework is now completed in the teacher-oriented class space (Bergmann & Sams, 2012; Mehring, 2016). However, there is more to the notion than this simplistic definition. The idea of inverted or flipped classroom was actually the brainchild of several educators dissatisfied with boredom in the classical teacher-centered classroom or, recently, learner-passivity within the overly tech-filled ‘smart’ classrooms (Young, 2009). Against this backdrop, the flipped toolkit was proposed to invest differently in the inside-and-outside-classroom space, technology, and learners’ active in-class participation, in a synergistic fashion to compensate for the monotonous, tedious teacher or computer monopoly in the classroom. In other words, the flipped model envisions a shift from mere content-transmission to learning and the learner (Mehring, 2016). Technology-enhanced flipped teaching empowers learners to overcome the constraints of conventional education, such as time, space, or location, and learn on-the-move at their own pace (Chen & Hwang, 2020). Different students may have different challenges at different points in time, and a physical class cannot be truly effective if everyone is forced to sit through the same lecture and learn at a fixed pace dictated by the teacher. With the aid of digital technologies, students can have an opportunity to gain initial exposure to the materials prior to class, learn quicker, and, especially those slower on the uptake, prepare at their own pace in advance to catch up with the class (Kim, Kim, Khera, & Getman, 2014; Shafiee Rad, Roohani, & Rahimi Domakani, 2021).

Flipped teaching has drawn L2 practitioners in recent years. Several studies (e.g. Chen & Hwang, 2020; Hsueh-Hua, Chih-Yuan, & Ching-Huei, 2016; Lee & Wallace, 2017) have addressed the advantages, concerns, and best models or practices for flipping the L2 classroom. Most notably, Lockwood and Folse (2014) presented evidence and arguments for incorporating flipped teaching into ESL classrooms and then compared its affordances to those of blended and mixed-mode learning. Lockwood (2018) further elucidates the intellectual foundations of why to flip the L2 classroom, beyond a simplistic, fad-like sense of ‘school work at home and home work at school’ to the fundamental rationale of cherishing learners’ higher-order cognitive functions of applying, collaborating, analyzing, evaluating, and creating in their pursuit of conceptual understanding and procedural fluency.

Other Second Language Acquisition (SLA) researchers based their flipped arguments on Bloom’s revised taxonomy (Anderson et  al., 2001)

as well as claims made by the cognitive load theory (Sweller, 1988) that learners’ reduced cognitive load (or freer working memory) – as a result of flipping the classroom – boosts deeper levels of engagement in higher-order cognitive functions of application, discussion, interpretation, and evaluation (Haghighi, Jafarigohar, Khoshsima, & Vahdany, 2019; Moranski & Kim, 2016). Flipped L2 teaching, in principle, encourages intensive out-of-class content concentration and supportive in-class talk-in-interactions, fosters enhanced L2 accuracy and fluency (Haghighi et  al., 2019), stimulates learners’ skill-based content pursuits on their own pace, and constructs more comfortable learning environments to attend to all needed L2 skills (Wagner-Loera, 2018). Still, others emphasized constructivist, collaborative aspects of the restructured classroom, arguing that flipped teaching (epistemologically) provides a social, supportive, inquiry-based, and transformative platform supported by Vygotsky’s (1978) Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) to cross over from lower-level content transmission to higher-order thinking and analytical processes.

# 2.2.  Flipped teaching and EFL expository writing

In order to effectively fulfill different functions of varied communicative, sociocultural significance, learner-writers need to develop competency in a variety of genres, including but not restricted to, narratives, descriptions, argumentations, and expositions. Different genres vary on both macrostructural (i.e. organizational, rhetorical) and micro-linguistic (i.e. lexical, syntactic) levels (Jeong, 2017). In a narrow sense, arguments and expositions, among others, are traditionally treated separately, one involving extended, evidence-based arguments of two (or more) topics or viewpoints and the other providing a clear, focused explanation of a topic, respectively. In a modern, broad sense, they are included under the macro-genre of arguments as they both require explaining, discussing, and arguing of topics, positions, problems, and views based on examples, facts, and evidence. In the context of the present study, expository writing was pursued as the most frequently presented and required genre in academic settings (e.g. Melissourgou & Frantzi, 2018). In general, a common macrostructure for the expository genre includes the following: introduction, thesis statement, arguments, and restatement or conclusion.

The ability to write is mostly a neglected or underdeveloped skill in EFL classrooms (Chen et  al., 2020; Wu et  al., 2020). Even (upper) intermediate-level ESL/EFL learners often feel dismayed by their underdeveloped skills in expository writing. That is probably why so many remedial courses are provided for ESL/EFL writers in college and university programs, even at advanced levels of English language acquisition, to guide them with continued support to overcome the heavy (meta)

cognitive requirements of the writing skill as well as their probable disillusionment with the L2-writing demands (Awada, Burston, & Ghannage, 2020). Much remains, therefore, to be pursued regarding the use of innovative approaches to writing pedagogy, especially focusing on various learning-management systems in the ICT era. The development of the expository macro-genre entails considerable higher-order thinking skills in comprehension, analysis, problem-solving, and evaluation (Burgos, 2017). Adopting flipped teaching, as an innovative approach, shows great potential to stimulate the language resources, interactional dynamics, and high-order cognitive functions necessary for expository writing through integrating ICT delivery affordances, learner-centered learning principles, and social, collaborative mediation. Recent L2 research has already heeded this potential (Adnan, 2017; Su Ping et al., 2020; Wang, Chen, Tai, & Zhang, 2021; Zou & Xie, 2018). Nonetheless, as noted by Keller (2016), the effects of ICT-infused learning settings, such as greater learner-oriented engagement, interaction, or involvement in class, can readily diminish if they are not supplemented by motivational dynamics which can explain learners’ choices, persistence, and behavior (Lee, Yu, & Liu, 2018), especially in EFL contexts where variably proficient learners are much less motivated to use English outside the classroom (Wang et  al., 2021).

# 2.3.  Motivation: the ARCS model

Motivation refers to cumulative arousal, or want, within learners with observable effects upon their learning behavior (Dörnyei, 2009). Motivation is of great, and often primary, importance in initiating L2 learning and, later, in sustaining the long, tedious learning process. Future L2 research should thus explore the integration of narrowly-construed motivational models into teaching-learning processes (Guilloteaux & Dörnyei, 2008). Despite this perceived need, research into EFL writing motivation is still incipient (Jang & Lee, 2019; Lee et  al., 2018). Only a few studies have explored learners’ maintenance or lack of motivation in flipped L2-writing classrooms (e.g. Chen et  al., 2020; Wu et  al., 2020). This study, therefore, argues that Keller’s (1979, 2010) ARCS model, a motivational design for learning and performance, can be employed alongside flipped teaching to further contextualize teaching materials or techniques, regulate communication, and manage social relationships in both technology-based and face-to-face settings, thereby influencing EFL learners’ writing motivation, learning, and performance (Karabatak & Polat, 2020).

The ARCS synthesis represents the four main systematic dimensions of attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction, which together constitute a process of designing and implementing motivational strategies addressing learners’ motivational characteristics or problems (Keller, 2010, 2016). The four ARCS components include the (sub-)processes that influence learner motivation, defined as the direction, magnitude, and persistence of the learning behavior, as seen in Table 1 below. In the ARCS model, attention, relevance, and confidence are the primary parts and are supposed to be the backbone of the theory, whereas satisfaction is the mixed outcome of the other components.

Accordingly, attention includes motivational variables associated with learner curiosity, arousal, interest, or boredom. Managing or directing students’ attention through applying cues and prompts is always an important issue in the learning context. Students vary in their tolerance of stimulation; therefore, finding the right balance of consistency, novelty, and variation is a challenge in attention-getting strategies (Li & Keller, 2018). Relevance, assuring that the learning experience of the student is personally relevant, is the next step. Learners should be assured that the instruction is completely related to their major personal needs, motives, or goals and pertinent to the setting before feeling motivated to learn. Little or too much confidence might be the obstacle for learning even when they are properly assured that the content is relevant to their needs (Chang & Lehman, 2002). The knowledge or capacity of self-control is the characteristic dimension of confidence. Learning materials, the environment, and the teacher’s behavior should be planned and students be persuaded that they can experience actual success. In this regard, Lamb (2017) notes that a ‘good teacher’ is by itself a motivator of sustained learning. In the case of even highly motivated L2 learners preparing for high-stakes tests, for instance, teachers’ effective use of learning materials or technologies and skillful teaching that seem to ensure learners’ success can help sustain the learners’ motivation and persistence with the task. In particular, the strategies or tactics that teachers use to motivate learners to attain some systematic and durable positive effect are referred to as motivational strategies (Dörnyei, 2001; Min & Chon, 2021). By employing ARCS motivational strategies alongside instructional materials with clear objectives, explanations, or examples, a teacher can influence the amount of time or concentration and the knowledge or skill a learner would bring to a task to achieve a certain goal (Keller, 2010). Learners will then feel motivated when the instruction is successful in materializing the first three motivational dynamics. Finally, the experience of learning satisfaction comes in to sustain a progressive desire to learn. Satisfaction can emerge from intrinsic (e.g. inner feelings of self-efficacy or competency) or extrinsic (e.g. grades, certificates, or rewards) factors.

Since the proposal of the ARCS motivational model, it has been applied to several educational domains along different research lines or theoretical approaches. Means, Jonassen, and Dwyer (1997) were among the first researchers who reported support for integrating Keller’s ARCS-motivational model into instruction to enhance the relevance of new learning materials. Subsequent studies reported benefits for the model in improving learners’ motivation, interest, attitudes, and performance on a variety of school (or university) subjects, such as chemistry (e.g. Feng & Tuan, 2005), physics (e.g. Aşıksoy & Özdamlı, 2016), mathematics (Turel & Sanal, 2018), and L2 learning (e.g. Chang & Lehman, 2002). With a simultaneous rise in the use of the emerging ICT-mediated or Web-based education (or eLearning) at the turn of the century, the need for the inclusion of motivationally adaptive frameworks and systematic motivational-design strategies such as the ARCS model, alongside online (or blended) learning platforms, became more pressing. Song and Keller (2001), for instance, argued that the ARCS model can be used as the foundation of a motivationally computer-adaptive instruction. Hodges and Kim (2013) reported improved attitudes toward an online college-level algebra course by sharing an ARCS-based-motivational video online.

Much recently, the ARCS model has found its way to blended- or flipped-teaching contexts (e.g. Aşıksoy & Özdamlı, 2016; Chang, Chang, & Shih, 2016; Keller, 2016). In L2 settings, Hao and Lee (2021) posit that the ARCS-flipped blend helps (i) attract learners’ attention through perceptual arousal and variability; (ii) highlight relevance through familiarity, motive matching, and goal orientation; (iii) foster confidence through defining performance requirements, providing success opportunities, and attaining personal control; and (iv) achieve satisfaction through intrinsic reinforcement, extrinsic rewards, and equity. Min and Chon (2021) suggested that the ARCS-motivational strategies, when applied appropriately with an a priori analysis of the learners’ perception of teachers’ motivational strategies, can help teachers influence L2 learners develop more self-determined forms of motivation. Further, teachers’ attention-getting and confidence-building strategies were found as significant predictors of learners’ language proficiency. Similarly, Chang et  al. (2016) and Refat, Kassim, Rahman, and Razali (2020) reported benefits for the ARCS model in improving EFL learners’ motivation and grammar skills in mobile inquiry-based and technology-enhanced classrooms, respectively. Almost all the aforementioned L2 studies as well as a perusal of the nascent line of L2-ARCS-flipped research indicate that the literature on the use of the ARCS model, on the one hand, and the ARCS-flipped synthesis, on the other, is meager. Further, combined with the paucity of research on L2-writing motivation, it is, therefore, important to examine if EFL teachers’ ARCS-based motivational practice integrated into flipped-L2-writing teaching can arouse or sustain learners’ motivation, improve their expository writing, and, in turn, explore how well the framework is received and perceived by the learners.

# 3.  The present study

This study aimed to probe if integrated-ARCS-flipped teaching affects EFL students’ expository-writing achievement and motivation. In brief, the following questions guided this study:

1. Does integrated-ARCS-flipped teaching have any significant effects on EFL learners’ development of expository-writing skills?   
2. Does integrated-ARCS-flipped teaching have any significant effects on EFL learners’ interest in the writing course?   
3. What perceptions did L2 learners have towards the integrated-ARCS-flipped writing instruction?

# 4.  Method

# 4.1.  Participants

The participants were a cohort of 59 EFL learners in two intact classes at a language institute in Iran. They were all Persian-speaking females – due to Iran’s gender-segregated educational system – with the age-range of 19-29 $\mathbf { \tilde { M } } = 2 4 . 5 3$ , $S D = 2 . 3$ ). None of them already traveled to any English-speaking country, and they enrolled for an advanced EFL course in the institute. Pearson’s Summit Series were taught two times a week, 90 minutes per session. The class with 31 learners $( 5 2 . 5 4 \% )$ ), held on even days, was assigned to the experimental group (i.e. ARCS-flipped setting) and that with 28 $( 4 7 . 4 6 \% )$ , held on odd days, to the control group (i.e. ARCS-face-to-face setting). In addition to the institutional placement criteria already in place, the Oxford Placement Test (OPT; Allen, 2004) was administered (Table 2) and, after running an independent-samples $t$ -test, it became clear that the classes were homogeneous in terms of general proficiency. Although the participants were notified that they were participating in a study, they did not know about the details. The participants fully agreed to take part in the research with the proviso that anonymous identities be ensured for subsequent references.

# 4.2.  Materials and instruments

# 4.2.1.  Edmodo

This study used the Edmodo educational social networking platform.1 Edmodo offers a free cloud-based social medium, a text-based a/synchronous learning platform, and a smartphone application with about 6.5 million clients (Nami, 2020). Its application offers to create and share course materials, assignments, and quizzes by supporting affordances such as online libraries, hyperlinks, multimedia, videos, pictures, documents, polls, and presentations (Unal & Uzun, 2021). On Edmodo, teachers and students can team up $2 4 / 7$ in a social, secure learning environment afforded with a message board that permits safe and free correspondence observable and controllable by the educator (Gan, Menkhoff, & Smith, 2015). Moreover, teachers can post homework, quizzes, or exams and schedule submission, feedback, or evaluation electronically.

# 4.2.2.  Writing tasks

Four essay-tasks were used to assess the participants’ expository-writing skills before and after the instructions. The pretest essays were cause-andeffect (‘What causes people to buy cell-phones and what effects may cell-phone use have on people?’) and comparison-and-contrast (‘Online chats vs. traditional letters: What are the pros and cons of both?’) sub-genres. The posttest topics were ‘What causes wealth in a country and what are the effects of growing up in wealthy?’ and ‘Textbooks or laptops at schools: What are the pros and cons of both?’. The number of words produced in each essay was about 600–1000 words. To assess the quality of learners’ written expositions, Hyland’s (2003) analytic scoring rubric was employed. The rubric included format and content (40 marks), organization and coherence (20 marks), and sentence construction and vocabulary (40 marks). The rater reliability indices for the pretest and posttest essays were .96, .97, .95, and .98, respectively.

# 4.2.3.  Course interest survey (CIS)

The 34-item, ARCS-based CIS (Keller & Subhiyah, 1993) was used to examine students’ interest in their relevant courses. A Likert-type scale with anchor-points set at 1 (Not True) and 5 (Completely True) was used for each item. The survey $\mathrm { ~  ~ \bar { ~ } a ~ } = \mathrm { ~ \ o ~ } . 9 2 \mathrm { ~  ~ \bar { ~ } \it ~ }$ ) contained four subscales:

attention (e.g. ‘the teacher creates suspense when building up to a point.’), relevance (e.g. ‘The things I am learning in the writing course will be useful to me.’), confidence (e.g. ‘I feel confident that I will do well in the writing course’.), and satisfaction (e.g. ‘I have to work too hard to succeed in the writing course.’).

# 4.2.4.  Semi-structured interviews

After having the participants’ consent, interviews were held to probe their attitudes toward the courses. A 6-item script guided the interviews which were conducted in the students’ mother tongue, Persian, to avoid misunderstandings and allow easier reflection and expression of their views. The script included yes/no and open-ended questions such as ‘How would you describe your experience in this writing course?’, ‘Were you able to understand the new content explained through this method?’, and ‘How did you find the instruction and the assigned activities within and outside the classroom?’. Each interview lasted for about 15 minutes and was recorded after taking each learner’s consent. The interviews were then translated into English by the first and the second authors.

# 4.3.  Data collection and procedure

The data were collected in several steps. First, two intact EFL classrooms, registered for an advanced course encompassing a writing module, were selected from an Iranian language institute in a southwestern province. The OPT was used, and an independent-samples $t { \cdot }$ -test was run on the results to ensure the presumed initial homogeneity $\left( t ~ \left( 5 7 \right) \right. = ~ 0 . 4 5$ , $\boldsymbol { p } =$ .517). The two classes were then randomly assigned to experimental and control settings. This research continued for nine weeks, two weeks for administering the pretest, the posttest, and the interest/motivation instruments, and seven weeks for the instruction phase. The instructor was the second researcher in both settings. The core content on how to improve expository writing was adopted from Smally, Ruetten, and Kozyrev’s Refining Composition Skills (2012), which was covered in both settings, differently though, to instruct learners on the macrostructures or micro-linguistic features of expository sub-genres. Table 3 outlines the content covered and practiced with both groups based on the source book.

Comparable amounts of time were allotted to the instructional activities that were coordinated and conducted by the instructor in both ARCS settings, on the one hand, and to the in- and out-of-class collaborative or individual essay-composing and feedback-sharing activities, on the other. The procedure is illustrated in Figure 1 and further expatiated below.

# 4.3.1.  ARCS-Face-to-Face (control) setting

In this only-physical, lecture-format setting, 28 learners met once a week in the classroom, sat passively, listened, and took notes when the instructor presented the content and provided examples (Table 3). Given the mainstream teacher-fronted architecture of most L2 classrooms in Iran, the learners were rarely involved in dialogue or talk-in-interactions around the content in class. At home, they did their paper-and-pencil essay homework. Nonetheless, the teaching process was based on the ARCS model of motivation. Specifically, at the beginning of the class, pictures were shown through an overhead video-projector, and learners were asked to describe each picture focusing their ‘attention.’ Then, the teacher tried to help them relate what they knew about expository writing in Persian to what they learned about the genre in English. The learners were ensured that writing effective expositions was a necessary sub-skill they needed to develop for their academic success (relevance). The teacher usually started teaching by providing an introduction and, then, offered the main parts step-by-step, moving from the basics to more complicated components (confidence). For instance, the teacher started talking about the compare-and-contrast sub-genre in detail and through examples, demonstrated its possible applications in their academic career, stimulated learners’ confidence that they would succeed, and reassured them that they needed only to get started and follow the guidelines. The instructor presented tips on the related rhetorical structure and linguistic patterns usually involved in each sub-genre by analyzing an exemplary expository essay with a familiar topic. The teacher, then, explicitly explained the possible intrinsic and extrinsic rewards of developing the skill during and after the course for their future academic success (satisfaction) (Figure 2). After each content part, a mini-essay-task was given and interactivity was allowed to share teacher/peer feedback and create a sense of satisfaction (e.g. best writers were exempted from doing additional homework). The teacher sometimes had learners discuss what problems they encountered along the way and help each other out. As for the homework, the learners had to compose expository essays individually each week. The participants in the face-to-face group were not provided access to the content videos prepared for the flipped group.

# 4.3.2.  ARCS-Flipped teaching (experimental) setting

In this blended virtual-physical space, the Edmodo social-learning platform was selected as the pre-class content-presentation platform for the flipped-writing course. Edmodo was employed due to its increasing educational potentials for teaching, learning, and assessment purposes (Unal & Uzun, 2021), its free service, and its inherent a/synchronous educational, learner-tracking features (Nami, 2020). Before the treatment, one session was devoted to explaining to students how the class and home activities or roles were assumed to be inverted through the flipped innovation, building up trust, introducing Edmodo-App, and trying its resources essential to the course. After this introduction (attention), the basic content was delivered initially through creating or sharing 10-to-15-minute instructional videos. Each video contained details on the rhetorical structures or related micro-linguistic features of an expository sub-genre, as outlined in Table 3. Complementary short video clips, reading/library materials, images, documents, and voiced PowerPoint presentations were also shared at intervals analyzing a typical written exposition and providing tips on the topic or the framework of essay-composing practice later in the classroom. The amount of time and practice devoted to each sub-genre was proportionate to that in the face-to-face setting. Three parameters were set intermittently in the design to ensure that each student watched and followed the Edmodo-delivered instruction: a list of questions, quizzes, and mini-talk responses. Outside the class framework, learners were also allowed to interact with each other and the instructor, independent of time and space, in a more private learning environment through Edmodo (Figure  3). Learners were then engaged in in-class collaborative and experiential knowledge co-construction accompanied by peer- and teacher-evaluations and feedback. The classroom work involved (i) collaborative expository writing modules (in multiple groups), inter-group essay editing, peer-reviewing, or teacher feedback in a dual face-to-face environment, and (ii) individual essay-writing modules, peer-editing, or teacher feedback. The group work often involved running parallel drafts by peers or having an editor piece together multiple contributions. This intensive, collaborative or individual practice and feedback provision inside the classroom was one of the main distinctions between the flipped and the mainstream teachings, as inverting the content presentation to flexible self-paced learning whenever and wherever learners liked (virtually via videos) allowed more time to inside-the-classroom practice, question-and-answer, and problem-solving.

As to the ARCS built-in components, content videos were ensured by design to continually attract learners’ attention to the main macrostructural parts or micro-linguistic features of the sub-genre. The follow-up quizzes, question-lists, and mini-talks reassured if learners attended to the videos. Complementary flipped materials, such as video clips or voiced PowerPoints, in turn, offered how-to-do knowledge about the assignments and possible applications of learning to real-life academic or career situations (relevance). Learners followed and reviewed the resources at their leisure, took notes, prepared questions, and then practiced the writing rules or structures of expository sub-genres before or during the face-to-face meetings. They asked questions related to the complicated concepts or topics, discussed experienced difficulties, and received (teacher) feedback or (peer) scaffolding. For difficult questions, the instructor directed learners to search for answers through online resources and tried to motivate them to shoulder their learning responsibilities (attention and confidence). She then shared a final essay-task to assess whether they learned the content based on vivid evaluation criteria (confidence), assigned scores to their outputs delivered via Edmodo, and provided more encouraging feedback on her assessments (satisfaction). Figure 4 below further illustrates the ARCS-flipped workflow.

# 5.1.  Effects of ARCS-Flipped teaching on expository writing

Descriptive statistics and relevant statistical tests were conducted to address the first research question and examine the effects of the integrated-ARCS-flipped course on L2 learners’ development of expository writing. As displayed in Table 4, the mean scores increased quite differently from the pretest to the posttest for both groups.

Inspection of the descriptive statistics assured that normality assumptions were met, with skewness-kurtosis values being well within the range of $\pm 1 . 5$ (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013). Furthermore, Kolmogorov-Smirnovtest results (i.e. .06, .21, .13, and .13) indicated no normality violations, which, in turn, supported the use of analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). For the ANCOVA, the covariate reliability assumption was reassured (.91). Further, the interaction between the covariate and the dependent variable was not significant, $F \left( 1 , 5 6 \right) = 1 . 0 1 0$ , $p = . 1 0 5$ , suggesting no violation of the homogeneous-regression-slope assumption.

Then, a one-way-ANCOVA was conducted to compare the effects of instructions on the learners’ posttests (the dependent variable), while simultaneously controlling for any pretest (covariate) differences. The ANCOVA results demonstrated that the difference between the groups’ expository-writing scores was statistically significant, $F \left( 1 , 5 6 \right) = 1 6 8 . 5 6 $ $\hbar < 0 . 0 5$ . Furthermore, the partial-eta-squared value (0. 751) was sufficiently high, indicating that the variance in the posttest was explainable by instruction-type explicitly in favor of the ARCS-flipped condition. Paired-sample $t { \cdot }$ -tests were then computed to more closely examine the pre-posttest improvement with each ARCS setting. Interestingly, both $t$ -test results were significant, namely, for ARCS-flipped $( t \ ( 3 0 ) = - 1 0 . 0 5 9$ , $p < . 0 5$ , eta squared $\ c = . 7 7 \cdot$ ) and for ARCS-face-to-face $( t ~ ( 2 7 ) = - 5 . 1 5$ , $p \ < \ . 0 5$ , eta squared $=$ .49). Eta-squared statistics were preferred over Cohen’s $d$ for the effect size due to the groups’ different SD values at two times (Cohen, 1988). Overall, although both groups experienced meaningful writing improvement as a consequence of applying ARCS-motivational strategies, the ARCS-flipped group achieved significantly higher expository-writing posttest-scores.

# 5.2.  Changes in L2 learners’ course interest

The second research question was addressed by examining L2 learners’ post-intervention CIS differences in the two settings. Descriptive statistics were first computed (Table 5).

As seen in Table 5, the skewness and kurtosis values are well within the normal range. Kolmogorov-Smirnov values reassured the existence of normality, supporting the use of ANCOVAs. Reliability indices were .91, .89, .93, and .88 for the ARCS dimensions, respectively. Similarly, the interactions between the dependent variables and their related covariates were insignificant, indicating homogeneous-regression-slopes.

Independent ANCOVAs were conducted to see whether the implementation of the ARCS-flipped versus ARCS-face-to-face instructions had any differential effects on EFL learners’ course interest. Results in Table 6 demonstrated that the differences between the groups were statistically significant, with high partial-eta-squared values, for all interest dimensions. Mean differences showed that the flipped group (Adjusted $M s = 4 . 2 1$ , 4.40, 4.70, 4.11) outperformed the face-to-face group (Adjusted $\mathit { M s } = 3 . 2 3$ , 3.45, 3.50, 3.14) in the posttest, suggesting greater effects for the flipped instruction on L2 learners’ course interest.

# 5.3.  Learners’ perceptions

As noted, semi-structured interviews were conducted with the participants in both settings to investigate their attitudes towards their related teaching-learning contexts. The interview data were translated into English, transcribed, and transferred to the Nvivo 10 coding program. The program provided great convenience in the detailed analysis, creation, and classification of the codes. Following Miles, Huberman, and Saldana (2013), a composite process-emotion coding framework, including a second-order sub-coding method, was adopted inductively to summarize the content and tag the recurring patterns in the data, such as naming the meaningful parts or chunks. Word-based, sentence-based, and phrase-based codings were conducted. Similar meaningful chunks were gathered under the same code. These codes were then condensed under a smaller number of pattern-codes or themes based on their interrelationships (Tanrıkulu, 2020). The pattern-codes were named with titles that were very close to the students’ expressions in the codes (e.g. Cooperative Learning). In order to provide further richness and reflect impartiality, codes with almost similar core content were indexed and categorized under the same sub-theme with a different code title (e.g. Peer Support). The codes were then analyzed and judged by two experts, namely, an associate professor of applied linguistics and an assistant professor of ICT and designing personal learning environments (PLEis). Considering their feedback, the (sub-)themes were clustered into a smaller number of fine-tuned categories at each level. Further trustworthiness of this phase was reassured by employing member-checking (i.e. the participants matching their responses with the codes) and pair-coding (i.e. two coders coding separately, then, together) methods to settle differences. Kappa Measure of Agreement was finally computed for the two coders, namely, .86, representing a very good estimate of (intercoder) agreement.

For the face-to-face setting, three themes and nine sub-themes were extracted from 28 interviews (Table 7).

As displayed in Table 7, learners’ retrospective views about the ARCS-face-to-face setting were categorized into two negative and one positive themes. In terms of the experienced ‘inflexibility,’ for example, one learner noted:

It was monotonous with no innovation. I cannot concentrate and learn many new things through lectures and doing homework alone because I might have problems. The teacher passed quickly, and I was not engaged. It was worse being alone at home since I had to wait to get back to the classroom. It was sometimes stressful.

Further, the interviewees showed negative attitudes towards boring lecture-based content presentations and lackluster activities during the classroom. One student reflected:

Our teacher was great, but the steady and boring face-to-face classroom and doing homework by ourselves at home made my things more difficult. I gradually lost interest in the subject; I was distracted. Then it was hard composing ideas in the form required because there was inadequate discussion and no feedback or hints. Writing this way is tedious, with no good effects, I think.

Interestingly, about six students pointed to the occasional interactivity feature they experienced in class when the teacher allowed so to achieve reflection, confidence, or satisfaction aspects of the ARCS model. In sum, the negative attitudes towards the lecture-homework features outweighed positive ones about occasional interactivity.

Conversely, interviews with learners in the flipped setting yielded four themes with nine sub-themes, as summarized in Table 8.

The interpretive analysis led to the categorization of learners’ retrospective perceptions into three positive and one negative (sub-)themes. As to flexible learning, for example, one learner noted:

I didn’t like it at the beginning. But after a week or so I began to like it because I could keep pace with the new content through watching videos at my leisure, freely asked questions in Edmodo, and learned new things through a more flexible learning procedure.

The interviewees also expressed positive views about the instructor, especially her sharing feedback, answering questions, and encouraging collaboration. For instance, one learner referred to her scaffolding and rapport-building below:

Our teacher was great. She helped us in drafting, writing, revising, and giving feedback. I liked her because of her understanding of our problems. She nourished a friendly atmosphere in our class in which we enjoyed writing in English for the first time.

With this co-participation tendency (i.e. cooperative learning), students’ engagement with activities and quizzes was transformed into more interactivity and deeper interest. Interactivity, in turn, brought with itself teacher/peer assistance, encouragement, and a friendly atmosphere. About 75 percent of the students reported that they had motivating interactions throughout the course. These along with enacting the ARCS features made the course more interesting. One interviewee noted:

My favorite part of this learning experience was being able to cooperate with my classmates through a more-relaxed, everywhere-accessible Edmodo App … Our teacher first divided us into a team … a good team … We had unity with each other in terms of what we wanted, and this made us help each other and improve more.

There were references to the novelty of the flipped content-presentation and online activity before the class work, which reportedly led to more personalized learning, learner autonomy, and self-directed independence. One learner noted:

I was completely disappointed to learn English writing before attending this course. What a great idea! Watching lectures at home, doing tasks with teammates, and solving the problems or more in-class practicing. It made me more engaged and self-regulated.

Still, there were views $( 4 9 \% )$ pointing to negative aspects of the flipped-teaching procedure as being time-consuming or, at points, costly. In sum, positive attitudes were expressed towards inverted content-practice, time/access flexibility, personalized/collective feedback, ample learning opportunities, interesting instructional activities, and the friendly atmosphere in the ARCS-flipped context.

# 6.  Discussion

This study examined the effects of ARCS-based flipped versus face-toface courses on EFL learners’ expository-writing achievement and course-interest levels in Iran. The results revealed that although both the ARCS groups made expository-writing gains, the flipped-teaching group attained more significant post-intervention achievement. Part of the progress in both groups can be attributed to the use of the ARCS model to address learners’ challenges or the course’s characteristics systematically with compatible motivational solutions (Keller, 2016). This instruction-motivation synthesis concentrated on not only improving teaching effectiveness but also strengthening learning motivation. This is an important issue since, as Chen (2021) reported, even highly proficient learners in the same classroom could have different levels of L2 writing motivation, thus, affecting their persistence, participation, and interactivity. This finding reverberated the notion that learner (writing) motivation is a key factor that dynamically instigates, (re)directs, synchronizes, strengthens, and evaluates cognitive and skill processes (Dörnyei, 2009; Dörnyei & Otto, 1998; Jang & Lee, 2019). In both settings, the ARCS components were conceptually built into the design of the instructional content, materials, or activities and procedurally implemented (differently though) in physical and virtual learning environments. The main feature of this motivational design, following Keller (2010), was that the designer-instructor tended to anticipate potential or assess actual challenges in specific learning environments and strategically decided which forces could be addressed, to what degree, through what resources, and through which tactics. This study, therefore, primarily adds to ARCS-based L2 research (e.g. Annamalai, 2016; Chang et  al., 2016; Min & Chon, 2021) resonating the need for systematic integration of a motivational design along the instructional process. Similarly, Min and Chon (2021), in their rather pioneering study of the ARCS model in L2 settings, reported that coordinated teachers’ use and students’ perception of attention-getting and confidence-building (motivational) strategies significantly predicted learners’ L2 proficiency. This is an important observation, considering Chen’s (2021) finding that proficiency does not necessarily contribute to L2 (writing) motivation, as noted above. On the contrary, there is almost a consensus that L2 motivation is a key contributor to L2 achievement (e.g. Dörnyei & Ushioda, 2009; Tahmouresi & Papi, 2021).

More importantly, the ARCS-flipped course was found to be more effective in nourishing L2 learners’ expository-writing skills. This finding is also important as it suggested that the motivational-technological synergy can be helpful to improve learners’ writing motivation and performance. That is, ARCS-motivational effects can be enhanced by incorporating ICT innovations into the instructional design, and the novelty effects of technology would be reciprocally sustained if they are accompanied by tactics that appeal to the learner’s motivation or interest in the course (Keller & Suzuki, 2004; Song & Keller, 2001). Nonetheless, there is more to the notion of the systematic use of flipped teaching than a mere haphazard application of technology in L2 pedagogy (Strayer, 2012). As noted earlier, the rubric of ‘flipping the classroom’ is essentially a departure from the didactic content-based teaching mode to embracing more learner-centered problem-solving, discussions, collaboration, and higher-order activities (Kim et  al., 2014; McLaughlin, White, Khanova, & Yuriev, 2016). Previous L2 research demonstrated that flipped teaching can be systematically used to that effect (e.g. Chen & Hwang, 2020; Doman & Webb, 2017; Hsueh-Hua et  al., 2016). Doman and Webb (2017), for instance, acknowledged the effectiveness of flipped teaching due to its provision of outside-the-class video-based lessons and stimulation of more in-class student-centered activities or interactive engagement with the materials, which, in turn, enhanced positive attitudes and learner autonomy. In this study, before learners participated in the face-to-face environment, learners were encouraged to follow the instructional videos or materials on Edmodo, discuss their problems, and engage in a miscellany of interesting individual or collective activities. Opportunities were made available for collaborative, peer-to-peer problem-oriented learning through the supportive virtual learning environment to surpass the temporal-spatial limitations of physical classrooms. In turn, further ARCS-oriented practice and (teacher/peer) feedback on the subject matter during in-class meetings helped learners, in Nicholes’s (2020) sense, spend more time with the materials, engage intensively with the writing process, and increase their expository-writing skills. In this regard, Nami (2020) noted that the most efficient learning today can take place in composite technological and face-to-face environments. Similarly, Shafiee Rad et  al. (2021), in their comparison of discussion-oriented and rule-reversal flipped-teaching models, highlighted the role of technology-enhanced, students-centered, or collaborative discussions in improving students’ writing achievement.

These perceived changes in the flipped setting, melded with the built-in ARCS features guiding the process, helped the learners improve positive attitudes, participation, and interest in the expository-writing course, as reflected in their retrospections. Similar to Doman and Webb (2014, 2017), even learners who were not initially drawn to the flipped model gradually grew more attuned to the changes and even embraced them more positively. CIS results indicated that the flipped course led to more improvement in learners’ post-intervention ARCS-based interest or motivational dimensions than the face-to-face course. Further inspection of the learners’ retrospections on the flipped-teaching dynamics in and out of the classroom helped explain the whys and wherefores of their aroused interest in the expository-writing course and their positive attitudes. As noted, prominent in their interviews were flipped features of higher (spatial-temporal) flexibility in access, interesting instructional activities, and a cooperative learning atmosphere. Such interpretations echoed similar (but limited) findings related to research on learning expository writing in blended or flipped environments (Chen et  al., 2020; Shafiee Rad et  al., 2021; Wu et  al., 2020) in that integrating virtual collaborative affordability fostered L2 learners’ expository-writing skills and positive perceptions or that applying online flipped-writing instruction not only enhanced students’ writing proficiency but it also hindered demotivation.

Top among the underlying reasons or psychological dynamics enumerated for the effectiveness of flipped teaching in related studies were self-interest, course flexibility, teacher/peer support, classroom atmosphere, learner autonomy, and, last but not least, motivation (or engagement). Wu et  al. (2020), for instance, reported that since their flipped-teaching design contained interesting features such as authentic learning materials, meaningful learning activities, and feedback from online native-speaker-peers, it led to more learning self-interest and less demotivation. For Marlowe (2012), lower levels of stress, and for Sahin, Cavlazoglu, and Zeytuncu (2015), interactive teaching and peer feedback were primaries. This study adds to the inchoate line of inquiry that calls for motivation-technology infusion into instructional designs to help learners maintain their interest in learning activities after they become accustomed to ICT features over time or come across motivational challenges and boredom (Bennett & Monds, 2008; Karabatak & Polat, 2020; Keller & Suzuki, 2004).

# 7.  Limitations

Some words of caveat are in order. First, the only comparison setting available to this research was the ARCS-face-to-face group, and it was not practical to include other settings like ARCS-free face-to-face or flipped settings. Future research should thus take heed of this constraint. Second, the study included only female L2 learners due to coeducational restrictions in Iran after the Islamic revolution. Third, only EFL learners’ expository-writing skill was examined, and other writing (sub-)genres were excluded for practicality reasons. Finally, the convenient sampling procedure was limited to selecting only intact classrooms on an advanced level.

# 8.  Conclusions

This study integrated the ARCS-motivational model with flipped teaching of an expository-writing course through Edmodo, a free educational, social-media platform, in an attempt to stimulate or sustain learner motivation and improve performance. The premise was that the flipped features of (time/place) flexibility, learner-centeredness, relaxed atmosphere, and collaboration would gradually grow less and less inspiring if no measure is taken to account for maintaining learner motivation. The motivation-technology synergy, however, helped, firstly, remove didactic, temporal bounds of the traditional (present-in-class and practice-at-home) lecture style, improve access, and further understanding of the content through shared resources and individualized feedback (Lee & Wallace, 2017). Secondly, the designer-practitioner’s ARCS-based interventions in the flipped course led to the learners’ sustained curiosity-arousal, attention to the content and task-goals, and confidence to succeed (Keller, 2010). This ARCS-flipped blend was found more successful in arousing the goal-oriented direction or persistence of L2 learners to remain on the task and progress than its traditional counterpart.

To conclude, this study adds to the incipient integrated-ARCS-flipped research (e.g. Chang et  al., 2016; Karabatak & Polat, 2020) but in the L2 domain. The findings offer interesting research avenues into the use of ARCS-flipped courses for teaching other L2 skills. This motivational-technological framework seems particularly useful for drawing learners’ attention to the relevance of other rather elusive L2 interactional aspects, such as conversational routines, formulaic sequences, or communicative acts, whereby more blended opportunities to flexibly engage in self and team learning encourages confident participation in interactive activities and higher-order reflective processes. Future research can also examine which ARCS dimensions more aptly address different writing sub-genres in different ERT settings during the COVID-19 era. Further, fostering EFL teachers’ diagnosis of students’ boredom or demotivation in ERT classes through the ARCS model is equally worth exploring. Finally, the issue of ARCS-flipped synthesis is a fruitful research domain for pre-service teacher training programs.
