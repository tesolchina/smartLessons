# Abstract

This paper focuses on the development of EAP methodology within an African EAP context. I describe the setting up and implementation of an EAP study skills programme at the University of Asmara, Eritrea, over the period 1994–1998 and its subsequent development up to 2002. The unique social and political context of the EAP programme served as a ‘laboratory’ for the development of a specific methodology relevant to the Eritrean context. Data come from an initial base-line study and subsequent monitoring of students’ progress with a retrospective in 2002. Examples are given of materials which illustrate the application of the theoretical approach. The paper shows the concept of intertextuality served to complement genre theory in offering an approach to EAP methodology. In particular, intertextuality offers a view of reading that addresses the issue of how new meaning is created from previous texts by readers and writers. Intertextuality, once combined with genre analysis, can offer a powerful basis for a coherent methodology that deals with the teaching of EAP reading and writing skills.

# 1. Introduction

In this paper I would like to offer a contribution to EAP studies by describing and analysing how a team at the University of Asmara in Eritrea went about implementing and evaluating an EAP programme. Because of the unusual circumstances some of the solutions we arrived at were unconventional, but led to insights which, I believe, have general implications for EAP methodology.

I will base this paper on an Eritrean perspective as I describe and explain the experience of the EAP team which attempted to meet the challenges of what seemed an unusual context. In dealing with these challenges we mostly worked in a context where we were forced to devise our own solutions. After describing these solutions I shall then attempt to draw out what could be of general relevance for other EAP practitioners. Consequently this paper may have a somewhat unconventional structure. I shall begin with the pedagogical and cultural background of the students at the University of Asmara, the setting up of the EAP programme and identify what was original and successful. I shall follow this with a discussion section in which I shall attempt to bring in studies from other contexts which seem to share a common thread.

# 2. The context of the EAP Programme

In 1994 when the EAP programme started, the country had only recently become independent (the end of Ethiopian rule in 1991, membership of the UN in 1993) and its educational infrastructure had to be built up practically from scratch. At a university level, this meant a number of challenges, a severe lack of resources, but also, as I shall explain later, opportunities for innovation and creativity.

My own role in this process was as advisor to the English Department of the University of Asmara (the only university in Eritrea) as part of a British Government (Overseas Development Agency, later Department of International Development) sponsored project to upgrade the materials and professional expertise of teachers of English in Eritrea at all levels from elementary school to university. While other UK colleagues worked with the primary and secondary schools, one of my main responsibilities at the University was to set up a team of teachers who would prepare and teach an EAP course for all tertiary level students. My brief was to help the team to design the course, develop materials and evaluate their success in achieving the course aims. In this paper I shall use the pronoun ‘I’ to indicate my own thoughts and deeds and ‘we’ to refer to the members of the EAP team.

A couple of classroom sketches may help to give the reader a picture of the of the EAP programme at the University of Asmara.

# 3. The student who was read by his book

First of all, let’s take the writing skill. First year EAP students began by writing short paragraphs on a non-academic topic, and a good example is one of the early writing tasks which we asked students to do in the classroom itself. It seemed a fairly cheerful activity that would encourage students to develop fluency and emphasise the communicative role of writing: ‘Bring along a favourite photo and explain why it is important for you.’

Right from the beginning it was clear that the students did not enjoy the activity. As I looked around my classroom the act of writing appeared to be almost physically painful. These fit and strong young people suddenly appeared cramped and awkward at their desks, their faces were unhappy, they would break out into a sweat and slowly push those sentences across the page. The whole body posture became distorted and uncomfortable. I sometimes felt like rushing down the aisles begging them to stop and offer them some lighter alternative such as our reading text on ‘The

Titanic Disaster’. When they finished the writing task their relief was palpable as they handed in that wretched piece of paper. Writing in class was so difficult that I simply could not suggest they should go back to re-read and revise what they had written. The process approach to writing—drafting and rewriting—would simply be prolonging cruel and unusual punishment.

The second snapshot comes from reading, but outside the EAP class. Students regularly got together in their free time to revise for exams, and would sit in a study room or an empty classroom, sometimes in groups, sometimes reading alone. They usually propped the book up in front of them and read intensely, without making notes or writing anything down. This would go on for several hours of utter stillness, except for the sound of pages being occasionally turned. It was as if the book was doing more work than the reader. One student commented on a friend of his who was reading in this way: ‘‘Look at Yonas, he’s being read by his book!’’

Given the way that our students approached academic writing and reading, how could we develop a methodology for an EAP programme which addressed those issues? Conventional approaches to writing based on the CARS model of academic genres (Swales, 1990) would be of little relevance for these students at this stage. Interactive approaches to reading would have to contend with students like Yonas who clearly believed that the message was in the text and not in the reader.

This paper is a study of how we developed an approach which, although it did originally start from genre as the only theoretical basis available to us at the time, took on board a concept which has not often featured explicitly in EAP methodology, that of intertextuality.

# 4. The background

When we began to set up the EAP programme for students taking the foundation course at the University of Asmara, Eritrea, between 1994 and 1998, we found an education system which had historically suffered from a lack of resources. Since independence in 1991 Eritrean primary schoolchildren had been gradually exposed to teaching in the main local languages, and by 1995 textbooks in English had become more commonly available at secondary level (English is the medium of education at secondary and tertiary level). Even with the arrival of textbooks, the students’ reading experiences at school were restricted to copying from them, memorising sections, or underlining and highlighting important topics. Their writing experience was even more limited. They would at times copy from textbooks or the blackboard, but never write sustained prose on their own. A visitor to a primary or secondary school would note, just by looking through the windows, that much classroom time was spent by teachers writing on the board and by pupils copying this down into their notebooks.

The school-leaving examination, which determined admission to the only university, was until 1997 exclusively multiple choice. Only in 1997 did a small paragraph-writing item appear in the English exam, as $1 0 \%$ of the total marks in that subject. Prior to that a student could pass through the entire education system and enter university without writing (rather than copying) a single sentence of English, or any other language.

To what extent did this background influence our EAP project at the university? Certainly it meant that the students’ previous experience, and attitudes within the school system made it difficult for them to acquire the skills that are necessary for academic reading and writing, first because they had little experience of reacting to a text in a creative or critical way, and second, because they had little experience in the mechanics or habits of writing. Given this context, it is not surprising that although English is the medium of education in Eritrea from grade 6 onwards it is still considered necessary for all students entering university to follow an EAP course for the first two semesters.

# 5. The EAP programme at the University of Asmara

In 1994, as part of a British-government sponsored project for the reform and upgrading of ELT in Eritrea, a new EAP programme began to be implemented across the University of Asmara. As part of the project framework a base-line study was carried out in order to serve as a benchmark for subsequent developments and as a needs analysis instrument. This helped in the formulating of course aims, course design, materials preparation and the development of the project.

Once the base-line study was in place an on-going monitoring process was set up to check the effect of the EAP programme, involving questionnaires and interviews with students and the staff of other departments. Thus we were able to monitor the students’ progress from their point of entry into the university and take steps to make any alterations as problems arose, or parameters changed.

Judging by the literature and my own experience in ESP projects in other parts of the world, it seemed to me that these initial conditions were different from most EAP foundation or pre-sessional programmes in other countries. We might note the following features:

(a) The mood in Eritrea was propitious to change and innovation. After independence in 1991 the working atmosphere was favourable to new ideas, and people were willing to put in extra hours to carry out these changes. There were no vested interests to placate or entrenched groups which created obstacles.   
(b) Unlike many aid projects, which are often set up in a rush, the programme was set up with monitoring built into it. The Brazilian ESP Project, discussed by Alderson and Scott (1992) typifies the dilemma of a post-hoc evaluation which is matched by a number of other projects featured in Alderson and Beretta’s (1992) collection. In Eritrea a base-line study was being carried out at the very beginning and developments could thus be evaluated on a constant basis.   
(c) The team was made up of a mixture of local Eritrean tutors, native English EFL teachers and academics from other countries who came as part of a

United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The majority of the UNDP tutors were specialists in African and Commonwealth literature from the sub-continent. They were initially dismayed to find that most of their time would be spent teaching paragraph writing and note-taking skills, but in fact this heterogeneous mixture proved a valuable one.

(d) As I have mentioned before, the students came from backgrounds where they had very little experience of reading outside the classroom, due to the lack of reading materials available, both in English and their mother tongues. In addition we might note that television had only recently become available and that it had not been part of the childhood experience of most of the students. This means that even compared to children from poor backgrounds in Latin America or other African countries they were not part of a globalised consumer culture, with the positive and negative aspects that this implies.

# 6. How the course evolved

The foundation course as originally conceived was based on developing EAP study skills, which were taught to students in all departments for the first two semesters. Taxonomy of study skills (Jordan, 1995: 7–8) gives a good idea of the aims the course was originally designed to meet. The methodology also relied heavily on genre approaches to the teaching of reading strategies, and writing in an academic context. The approach could be characterised as based more on Swales (1990) and Martin (1989) rather than ‘New Rhetoric’ approaches (Hyon, 1996). For example, we taught the basics of paragraph writing, and the structure of the research report. We used semi-academic texts taken from sources like the New Scientist. After the first two semesters of non-specialised topics, many departments followed with an extra semester of EAP work, which was oriented towards each department’s specific topics and skills, since students did not begin to study in their specialism until the first semester of the second year.

So far, so good. As with many new EAP programmes featuring the presence of an outside ‘expert’, I (the expert) found during the implementation of the course that reactions were positive and enthusiastic. However, the ongoing monitoring began to reveal problems. Across departments the subject specialist staff noted that students’ weaknesses remained as unchanged. Students continued with inefficient reading strategies, they had difficulties in inferring nonexplicit meaning, distinguishing between important and less important information, and in using contextual guessing as a strategy for vocabulary acquisition. In addition, students still found it difficult to write in a fluent and relaxed way. Those scenes of cruel punishment did not go away. The specialist departments also complained that when the students started to write assignments and reports, in their second and third years, they still found it very difficult to use academic norms for making use of sources. Although the students were given instruction and opportunities to practice quoting, paraphrasing and summarising from source texts they found it difficult to join ideas from the source materials with their own thinking. We recognise that this is a general problem for all those engaged in learning academic writing, as Pennycook (1996) attests, but nonetheless the lack of progress in this area was disappointing to us.

One of the observations made by Eritrean colleagues with a deep knowledge of the students’ background pointed out a possible cause of this. We had given students examples of genres, as models or a focus for analysis, and we had helped them to understand the ideas of the writer in order to answer our comprehension questions. However, we had not helped our students to trace the ideas that featured in the texts, where they came from and what the reader was expected to do with them. Starting an EAP course with writing tasks based on genre was a bridge too far, too soon.

# 7. Characteristics of the problem

We took our ongoing monitoring very seriously. We carried out interviews with students at all levels, gave questionnaires which were completed by teachers and students, and ran a longitudinal study of the written work produced by the students as they developed their writing skills. We tried to involve the students themselves in this diagnostic process, as self-awareness was one of the goals of the project, and they were regularly asked to evaluate their own strengths and weaknesses and to identify what they had learned.

In making a general diagnosis of the problem important information also came from the students’ literacy background at primary and secondary school. At that time a major research project was being carried out into secondary school education in Eritrea (Ghebrebrhan & Holmes, 1999) This helped to provide information which supplemented the monitoring at the university, and showed the deeply-rooted nature of the problem. The vast majority had begun their education in Amharic, under the previous Ethiopian regime, and had learned to read and write in that language. The average age at which they considered they had started to read ‘fluently’ was between 10 and 11. At school they had only textbooks to read, there was no opportunity for extensive reading [in the sense that Day and Bamford (1998: 5–8) define it]. There were no class readers, no magazines or newspapers, even in Amharic, much less in their native languages or English.

This is not to say that students hadn’t the capacity for creative reaction to a text. Part of the study skills course initially included ’fun activities’, such as listening to pop songs. It was reported by many of the teachers and students that this was a very popular part of the course, not just because of the music but in the discussion of the meaning of the words. This involved understanding metaphors and reading between the lines. The students enjoyed it very much, and seemed excited at this opportunity to look at text in a different way, although they didn’t regard it as part of a ‘serious’ study skills course.

We were fortunate that the circumstances made Eritrea a suitable locus for change at that time. All the information coming in to the project team meant that our course design gradually changed during the 4-year period under discussion. By the end of the 1997–1998 academic year, the reading and writing skills teaching in the original course design had been supplemented by exercises and activities focusing not just on the generic aspects of texts. As well as being able to identify the features of particular genres we gradually developed materials that encouraged students to focus on how ideas were incorporated into a text by a writer and how the reader should then generate his or her own new ideas from reading. To go back to an earlier sketch, Yonas had to learn how to read the book back. As we developed this approach we realised that this other dimension to reading and writing came from the concept of intertextuality.

# 8. The roles of genre and intertextuality

Let me first explore how we saw the relationship between genre and intertextuality. Genre theory deals with how the structure and organisation of texts are socially determined, and ‘fixed’ in the way they are created and presented to an audience. Within society, genres are characterised by the purposes which they serve, as discussed by Martin (1989) and Swales (1990). Bhatia (1993: 17) even says explicitly that genres are ‘conventionalised’. The overall goals and the activities of the members of a given discourse community are not subject to rapid change, and so the matching genres tend to acquire certain well-known characteristics that reflect a text’s purpose and enable members of the discourse community to identify and respond to them. Society does change however, and genres change with it, if only slowly. The business letter becomes a fax or an e-mail; telephone conventions change with the advent of the mobile phone, and we no longer write to a hotel to make a reservation. But in general genres remain surprisingly recognisable over time and they act as points of reference and stability within the discourse community.

Since genre theory deals with how texts are organised and fixed by the discourse community, this has provided an important framework for EAP course design. Indeed, a genre can provide a rationale for EAP work that covers the needs of students from their first academic ‘opening perspectives’ to the PhD thesis (Johns & Swales, 1992). The students can become reader-researchers who will recognise certain genres and identify their purpose and characteristics. From this, readers can identify what should be the expected reactions to a given text. As writers, they can follow through the organisational stages of that genre, as in the case of Swales’ (1990) model of the moves in article introductions. This gives students a guide for following and working within the norms of the discourse community and society in general, one of the major challenges that non-native English speaking EFL students have to face.

Genre offers mainly a theory of writing, especially useful for those who already have something to say. However, while genre analysis explains how texts are organised, fixed and maintained, it does not explain how new texts are created. It does not deal with where the writer gets the ideas from in the first place, but only informs of the limits and the constraints which govern how this new meaning is presented to the audience. If we return to the world of literary studies, where the concept of genre first appeared, it might be interesting to see if literary theory provides insights into this process. In fact, there is a concept which deals with the creation of new meaning, and that is intertextuality.

Intertextuality deals with the way new meaning is created from old, by looking at how new writing incorporates previous texts by transforming them into the new text. In its original form the concept of how a ‘dialogic interaction’ takes place in the writing and reading of texts was put forward by Mikhail Bakhtin writing in Russian in the twenties of the previous century (Morris, 1994: 48). The term itself comes from Kristeva (1986) who regards intertextuality as the property of texts in being able to incorporate previous texts. It also refers to a process of understanding where the reader creates another layer of meaning by understanding and reacting to the original text. In effect intertextuality sees writing and reading as creative processes in which new text is formed.

This is not entirely new to the EAP world. Intertextuality made the crossover from literature to applied linguistics as one of De Beaugrande and Dressler’s (1981) standards of textuality. Academic reading and writing are, of course, profoundly intertextual processes. The discourse community demands that academic writing should not simply follow the moves typical of the genre but that the student should incorporate other writers through the students’ previous reading in that area. Strangely, although genre has become a mainstay of EAP methodology, intertextuality is rarely mentioned explicitly. Perhaps the most significant treatment of intertextuality in ESP was Berkenkotter and Huckin’s discussion (1995) of the process by which a biologist pursued a research programme which eventually and somewhat painfully resulted in the publication of a research article. With regard to the teaching of EAP, Johns (1997) mentions the role of intertextuality particularly with regard to fluent academic reading (pp. 35–37). McCarthy and Carter (1994) mention the role of intertextuality in a chapter entitled ‘Linking the levels: grammar, lexis and discourse’ which is mainly a reading-based view. In terms of EAP courses which discuss their methodological base, intertextuality has not, to my knowledge appeared explicitly.

It is now possible to reinterpret one of the main challenges to the student—and teacher— of EAP writing as being how to balance the constraints on the organisation of the text (the generic features) with the interweaving of sources and the student’s own ideas (the intertextual features). Thus, genre and intertextuality are two main dimensions of the process of reading and writing for academic purposes. It is important to fit into the demands of the genre and to observe the requisite moves and components of the text. It is also crucially important to incorporate previous writing and reading and present it in such a way as to create new meaning.

The diagram (Fig. 1) illustrates our own view of how the two dimensions of genre and intertextuality operate as described above. This view of reading and writing emerged from a synthesis of different factors which were particularly characteristic of the Eritrean context. The reader is engaged with the ‘current text’ and is matching this with examples of the same genre, to look for those features which help understanding or assess the importance of what is being read. One intertextual dimension lies ‘behind’ the text. Understanding is also dependent upon an awareness of other sources that may have gone into that text. This is what, historically, has been the focus of the literary view of intertextuality; as Kristeva (1986: 111) says ‘‘this term has often been understood in the banal sense of study of sources.’’ Our own view does not stop with intertextuality ‘behind the text’, however, but goes on to focus on the new intertext which the reader is creating. This new intertext can take the form of simple individual understanding or can be a formal written response. Thus, both reading and writing are processes in which genre and intertextuality help to create, or re-create new text.

# 9. Putting intertextuality into practice

As we developed the tasks and activities to bring an intertextual view of reading and writing more closely into the study skills course design we drew upon the diversity of our teaching team. In particular we made sure that those colleagues who came from a literature background were able to contribute positively. Very often those with a degree in English literature find themselves forced to teach an ESP course and resent it. Our literature colleagues in Asmara, on the other hand, seemed to find the challenge an exciting one. From them came the suggestion to use ‘short short stories’, and get students to retell and rewrite them. Using fiction was something outside the EAP tradition but which fitted with our methodology. A supplement consisting of about half a dozen ‘very short’ fiction stories was prepared which was used as an adjunct to the course, and was well received by the students. In addition we began to use stories by Eritrean authors which were being translated from the local languages into English by members of the team, and by our own senior students in the English department. By gathering together suggestions from the members of the team we were able to make use of their varied backgrounds and incorporate a range of activities, a sample of which is given below. This contribution from literature teachers to an EAP course was an important one.

The stages of opening the students to an intertextual view of reading and writing developed as follows, beginning with the simplest activities:

interpreting metaphor;   
traditional sayings;   
explaining advertisements;   
rewriting stories;   
writing a ‘research report’; and writing a study summary.

This framework moves from tasks and activities where students begin to appreciate that a text has a message, to a stage where they see the role of the reader as interpreting the message, to a final stage where the student creates texts with new messages.

# 9.1. Interpreting metaphor

We originally realised the value of this technique after finding the use of pop music to be much more popular and useful than we had originally envisaged (as mentioned above). Metaphors demand a re-creative reading, and can vary quite legitimately in their interpretation from one reader to the other. The exercises were not outstandingly innovative in themselves. Usually we gave our students 10 sentences, each containing a metaphor, and asked them to identify and interpret the metaphors. Students can also be asked to translate the metaphors into their mother tongue, where very often they find that they have to change the terms used to retain the meaning. This type of exercise helps students to see text as something which does not have a single fixed meaning, but which can have different interpretations depending on the individual readers. This is perhaps the first stage towards looking at text as more than onedimensional and the first step to creating a new intertext as part of the reading process.

# 9.2. Traditional sayings and idioms

Closely following on from interpreting metaphor is another well-known activity, found in a number of EFL textbooks, where students are asked to interpret or explain wise sayings or idiomatic expressions. These can be taken from their own or other cultures. Apart from being enjoyable, once again, the activity involves recreating and rewriting, and focuses on the role of the reader in interpreting rather than understanding literally. To take an example, students gave an expression in the main Eritrean language, Tigrinya: ‘To ride a lion and call the dogs’. This means to make a lot of fuss without accomplishing anything. It comes from the fact, well-known in some cultures, that dogs will not chase after a lion. We don’t have a similar expression in English, we have to explain it literally, thus the reader learns that the same text can have its meaning understood in different ways by different readers and appreciates how a text can have different meanings for different audiences. This type of activity explores the dimension behind the text and encourages the reader to construct new meaning as part of reading comprehension.

# 9.3. Explaining and interpreting advertisements

One activity which we had always used on the course was describing photographs and drawings. This was an enjoyable and well-focused activity which helped students to use descriptive and narrative language more precisely. One standard assignment, which I mentioned at the beginning of this paper, asked students in the first semester to bring a photo that meant something to them, describe it and explain why it was so important. This helped the members of the class, including the teacher, to get to know one another. We built on this by taking a specific genre, the advertisement, and using magazine adverts which featured pictures. We developed a number of questions to help the process of interpretation, such as describing the people in the illustration and asking the students to verbalise the hidden message. This led to a critical and creative attitude to advertising text. For example, many adverts for aftershave feature scenes such as a half-dressed woman lying on a bed, and have the outrageous but clear hidden message that if the man uses X aftershave then the woman is available.

One particularly creative exercise is to re-write the caption so as to transform the advert from propaganda to a turn-off. This is a first stage in developing the role of a reader as someone who replies to a text. One of the best opportunities was afforded by a famous cigarette advert which shows wild mountain country and a lone cowboy on a horse crossing a stream. The original message was ‘Come to [name of cigarette] country’. In response the students produced anti-captions such as:

‘I came here alone because my wife died of lung cancer’   
‘I’m on my horse because I get out of breath when I walk’   
‘I’m on my own because my friends can’t stand the smell of tobacco smoke’   
‘I’m on a horse because I spent all my money on cigarettes and I had to sell my car’

And so on.

New meaning is created. This is a beautiful example of intertextuality framed by genre.

# 9.4. Rewriting stories

Another exercise which focused on combining genre and intertextuality, was to rewrite some of the ’very short stories’ which we had prepared to give the students reading experience. The task is to read a short story set in one culture and re-write it for your own culture. This means reading the story, and identifying what could be changed and what should stay the same. I’ll take as an example a famous Somerset Maugham story called ‘The Verger’. Maugham’s original story concerns a verger (someone who looks after the church premises) who loses his job because he can’t read or write. The new vicar dismisses him because he thinks that a verger should be an educated person. The verger is devastated and has to look for another job. Eventually he opens a tobacconist’s shop in an area of town where he noticed there were few shops. The shop does very well, he finds another site and opens another shop, and soon he has a profitable chain of retail outlets. The de´ nouement occurs when he goes to the bank to open an account. He has a small box full of money. The bank clerk is amazed at the amount of money, and asks the ex-verger to sign a form. The ex-verger explains that he can’t read or write. The clerk says: ‘‘You can’t read and write and you’ve made all this money! Imagine where you would be now if you could read and write!’’ The answer of course, is ‘I would still be the verger at the local church.’

Rewriting this story for another cultural context was an enthralling activity. Some groups made only slight changes. The protagonist changed his name, his job became a school janitor, for example. Nobody liked the idea of the tobacconist so the business became a tea shop and simple cafe´ , and so on. Others made more radical changes and political points. An accountant loses his job because he is HIV positive. He later becomes famous by conducting health awareness campaigns for the government and changes many people’s lives. A woman with six children is widowed and finds her husband has left her no savings except an old car. She starts a driving school to teach women to drive and soon has a flourishing business. In every case there is that final scene where the protagonist is asked: ‘But imagine if you hadn’t this [disability]. . ..?’ And the punch line: ‘I would still be. . .[boring life]’

This type of response to text again emphasises the framework which a genre imposes, but encourages the reader/writer to respond creatively and to make a personal statement, which can vary from one reader to another. We used a number of other stories and we found that the idea of responding to a story by re-writing or recreating was for the students an exciting new approach to reading a text.

9.5. Writing a research report: ‘Do Eritreans like flowers?’

Next, moving nearer to the demands of academic writing, comes the ‘research report.’ We initially used an article from a local newspaper as a point to introduce this genre in a non-academic way. In this text a local journalist asked a number of people in Asmara about their attitudes to buying flowers and giving them as presents. The report used evidence from informants to answer the ‘research question’ of the title. This is the framework for the task. The students must prepare a report in which they submit evidence they have gathered to answer the question. The focus is not on using direct or indirect speech in reporting other people’s opinions but on looking for evidence that justifies an answer. For example, an informant who says: ‘‘Yes, Eritreans like flowers, because I like flowers’’ is not providing evidence to answer the question. The report needs concrete examples such as ‘‘Yes, Eritreans like flowers; for example at my graduation my relatives bought me dozens of bouquets of flowers.’’

Not only is this a cheerful topic, but in this example students learn to handle quoting from sources while becoming familiar with the genre of the research report. This type of activity can take place during the first two semesters before students begin to specialise, and they can research a number of similar topics. By making them familiar with the essential intertextuality of such reports we can move more easily into the conventions of academic quotation and citation procedures.

# 9.6. Writing a study summary

Finally, moving squarely into the demands of academic study we have the ’study summary’. This type of summary, first put forward by Sarig (1993) and used by Holmes and Ramos (1993), is a summary of an original text which is based on the needs of the student. It is emphatically not the traditional summary which boils down the whole of an original text to a quarter or a fifth of its size, retaining all the main ideas of the text. The idea behind the study summary is that the student seeks within a given academic text, a particular section which matches their study purposes. Thus, the summary may only deal with a small part of the original text in order to incorporate it—as one of the sources to be cited—into assignments and essays when the need arises. As a guide we used a ‘standard exercise’ procedure (Holmes & Ramos, 1993; Scott, Carioni, & Zanatta, 1985) where the students are given a series of activities to carry out, from initial skimming of the text to a final self-evaluation of their difficulties and achievements in carrying out the summarising task.

This again emphasises the role of the individual reader, first of all in being aware of the particular purpose of each act of reading, and then, that the same text may be read in different ways by different readers. The standard exercise format is also useful as it gives a set of guidelines for any academic reading, so that from this the students can go on to reading texts in their specialism.

# 10. Evaluation

We still have not had time or appropriate circumstances to evaluate all these changes and see how they worked their way through the students’ subsequent academic careers. Unfortunately, since we implemented our programme in 1998, Eritrea has gone through a war and three invasions which have caused much suffering, loss of life and displacement. The DfID programme finished coincidentally in that same year of war and many members of staff left Eritrea. Beyond the EAP programme there was a wider disruption in the work of the university and of the students’ own academic development. However, in spite of the difficult circumstances, since 2000 I have been able to return to Eritrea and I have visited former students and colleagues on several occasions.

Without a formal evaluation procedure I can only draw some general reflective conclusions, which are nonetheless useful ones. For example, we seem to have been wary about bringing in ‘critical’ reading at an early stage. There now seems no reason why the programme shouldn’t encourage students to develop critical reactions right from the start. After all, rewriting the caption to the cigarette advert is quite clearly critical literacy, although we did not give it that name. In addition, students were already rewriting their short stories to make a moral point or illustrate their own ideas. Perhaps, somewhat timidly, we regarded critical reading as a ‘higher’ stage in developing EAP, reflecting a dilemma in choosing between what Benesch (2001) calls the ‘pragmatic and political’. We were also, perhaps, too reluctant to dedicate class time to sitting down and writing. For example, it would have been useful to spend $1 5 ~ \mathrm { m i n }$ at the beginning of each week in getting students to write journals. When a teacher watches students as they write and helps them as problems arise this is a wonderful opportunity to assess the students’ writing and to introduce a more relaxed attitude to writing itself.

# 11. A wider context

In writing this paper I have been very conscious of the question of how relevant this Eritrean experience may be for other EAP practitioners and of the usefulness of this kind of case study to those who did not directly share our experience. Canagarajah’s description of local knowledge is comforting here: ’context bound, community specific and nonsystematic because it is generated ground up through social practice in everyday life’ (2002: 244) Exchanging local knowledge is one way in which diverse experience can be transmitted from one peripheral location to another, or even from the periphery to the centre.

There are other ways in which the Eritrean experience can resonate with that of other contexts. It can be argued that Eritrea is characteristic of what Vavrus (2002) following Pennycook (1998) calls ‘postcoloniality’. Vavrus identifies, from a Tanzanian perspective, characteristics of economic deprivation which have a strong influence on all aspects of education. As she says, ‘material conditions are intertwined with the national economic conditions as well as beliefs about language in development’ (Vavrus, 2002: 375).

More directly, in terms of lived classroom experience, our students had much in common in terms of reading needs with students I have taught in other countries, such as Brazilian students on ESP courses (Celani, Holmes, Ramos, & Scott, 1988; Figueiredo, 1994), especially those coming from poorer regions of Brazil. In addition the ability of students to respond and react critically, when given the chance, is well documented by Canagarajah (1993), whose Sri Lankan students subverted American Kernel Lessons in a way similar to the way our students re-wrote the captions to advertisements. In my own current work in a British university, taking on board the intertextual aspect of academic literacy can often be just as great a challenge to native speakers as it is to international students.

# 12. Conclusion

This paper proposes the inclusion of an intertextual dimension into EAP methodology for students who have not yet acquired the skill of responding to a written text. Although genre has provided a successful and widely accepted theoretical basis for EAP methodology and course design, this was not enough to tackle the challenges presented by the context of the Eritrean students. Indeed, I would claim that in situations such as Eritrea, where students had not yet begun to read in a creative and responsive way, to teach reading and writing using a purely genre-based approach does not meet their primary needs. By offering a range of reading/writing encounters from our own classroom experience I have tried to show how it was possible to encourage an intertextual approach to reading in an academic context, placed firmly within the framework which genre affords. In this way the students were able to regard reading texts as an opportunity for response and re-creation. The act of writing then became a chance to draw on what they had read, bringing in their own experience and purposes and adding another dimension to the original text by creating new texts of their own.

It is no surprise that Paulo Freire discovered this long before we could label it as anything so elaborate as ‘dimensions of genre and intertextuality’ (Giroux, 1988: 86): ‘The act of studying is not merely a relationship with the immediacy of the text, it is in a broader sense an attitude towards the world.’
