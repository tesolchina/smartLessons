# ABSTRACT

Keywords: Science dissemination Multimodality Modal density Modal coherence Digital genres

As science communication goes beyond the traditional borders of academia, new science dissemination genres emerge. This paper presents a multimodal analysis of two online science videos uploaded to YouTube: a recorded TEDx talk and a PBS Space Time video. We have determined the existence of two layers of modes in online science videos: embodied and filmic modes. The former are deployed by the speaker, while the latter are added to the ensemble during postproduction and editing. Our analysis sheds light on three main aspects of this multimodal orchestration: modal density, modal coherence, and genre definition. Our findings show that online science videos are more modally dense as a result of the incorporation of more filmic modes into the ensemble. In addition, we also find that the use of filmic modes requires some degree of expertise and know-how in order to keep the coherence of the multimodal ensemble. In short, the PBS Space Time video shows a higher degree of density and coherence. We conclude that the two genres are at different stages of development as digital genres.

# 1. Introduction

1.1. Science dissemination and recontextualization of scientific content

There seems to be an increasing trend for science to transcend the boundaries of academic institutions. As Scotto di Carlo (2014) points out, cultural organizations no longer hold the monopoly over knowledge dissemination. New communication channels have appeared in the picture that bring science closer to the public without the need of an academic institution as an intermediary. In this scenario, \*the success of knowledge dissemination depends on how experts contribute to the way in which the audience approaches science not as something distant and separate, but as a heritage belonging to the whole community (Scotto di Carlo, 2015, p. 219). The Internet has played a crucial role in this process multiplying the possilities for scientists to present their work to the general public. In fact, Rowley-Jolivet and Carter-Thomas claim that

[the Internet has changed the game rules for scientific communication in several respects: the need to address a global, indeterminate audience, not an esoteric circle of peers, raises the problem of knowledge asymmetry between science researcher and audience, and requires suitable discursive strategies (2019, p. 82).

Online videos seem to be one of the preferred options to disseminate science (Erviti & Stengler, 2016; Kousha et al., 2012; Leon & Bourk, 2018) and the challenge to adapt to an audience that does not share the same academic background is aparent in the discursive strategies and semiotic modes used. This adaptation has been referred to in previous literature as recontextudlization. From a multmodal perspective, that is, taking into acount the variety of semiotic modes, i.e. ways of conveying meaning, involved in the communicative process, Bezemer and Kress have described recontextualization as:

moving meaning material from one context with its social organization of participants and its modal ensembles to another, with its different social organization and modal ensembles. Meaning material always has a semiotic realization, so recontextualization involves the re-presentation of the meaning materials in a manner apt for the new context in the ight of the available modal resources (2008, p. 184).

In the case f science dissemination, recontextualization means moving scientific content from academia and its associated genres to a different context in which new genres and new multimodal ensembles, i. combinations of semiotic modes, become available, and more importantly, a context in which the audience has different needs and expectations. According to Bezemer and Kres (2008), recontextualization involves four rhetorical principles:

a) Selection of both content that is relevant for the new audience and of semiotic modes which are available in the new context b) Arrangement of the content in a way that is best for the audience and for the communicative purpose; c) Foregrounding of the elements that are particularly significant in the new context; and d) Social repositioning or reconstruction of social relations between the speaker and the audience.

These rhetorical principles can be realized by means of different strategies. For the case of scientific discourse, Luzon (2019) identifies four groups depending on their function: i) build credibilit; ii) uild persuasive arguments ii) tailor information to the assumed knowledge of the audience; and iv) engage the audience. Although recontextualization has been extensively dealt with in previous research, to our knowledge, few studies approach this ssue from a multimodal discourse analysis perspective.

# 1.2. From traditional to digital genres

As Maingueneau (2010) points out, the concept of genre evolves with history, and the creation of the Internet and new digital platorms has facilitated the emergence of new types of genres, which cannot always be analyzed with classic Discourse Analysis approaches. Of particular relevance for the present study is the case of digital genres, which are web-mediated genres that use the Internet as a medium. According to Shepherd and Watters (1998), these genres can be defined using three aspects: content form and functionality (the capabilities afforded by the new online medium). As these authors explain, some digital genres (cybergenres) originate from a traditional genre and stay unchanged as they move to the online realm (relicated genres), while others evolve and acquire new traits using the affordances of their new medium (variant geres). There are also novel geres that are created directly in this new medum and are ither substantilly dfferen from existing ones or created from cratch. In many cases the trend is a follow: a replicated genre starts adapting to the new medium and incorporating more affordances until it becomes a novel genre.

This paper wants to probe into the multimodal nature of online science videos, exploring the differences between two digital genres. In the case of the genres that concern this study, a TEDx Talk video and an episode from the YouTube channel PBS Space Time, we can identify a replicated genre in the former and a novel genre in the latter. We take this hypothesis of different stages of development of the two genres as a starting point for the analysis, as remarkable differences are noted in the exploitation of the affordances provided by the online medium. Replicated genres can only attain so much potentia in comparison to the original genre they depart from, while novel genres typically take full advantage of their medium.

# 1.3. YouTube as a platform for online science dissemination

As mentioned in previous sections, the Internet has played and stil plays a crucial role in the dissemination of science and in the creation of new genres. In particular, the video-sharing site YouTube has gained significant relevance and hosts an increasing amount of scientific content (Allgaier, 2020; Geipel, 2018). This growing popularity of YouTube has caught the atention of researchers in different fields. Snickars and Vonderau (2009) describe YouTube as a platform, an archive, a library, a laboratory, a database, and a medium at the same time. Burgess nd Green (2009) see i as a spearhead of participatory culture. Soukup (2014), on the other hand, reflect on the complexit of the platform, claming that it has grown into something biger than a video-sharing site, a social meda site, an educational resource or a communication channel, and therefore deserves more attention from communication research. The potential of YouTube for the communication and dissemination of science has ben noted by several researchers who point out advantages like the rapid distribution, the amplification of content or the abilit to have informal exchanges (Osterrieder, 2013).

The factors that make science videos successful have also been the object of recent research. For instance, Welbourne and Grant (2016) examined factors that affect channel and video popularity in science communication on YouTube. They found that user-generated content seems to be more popular among viewers than professonally generated content in the area of science communication. They also found that credibilit of the content does not necesarily depend on high production values but also on issues such as communicator experience, impartiality, afint, accessbility, and ability to build meaningful connections with the audience. In addition, it must be noted that the line between professional and user- (amateur) created content is oten blurry (Munoz Morcillo et a., 016). I is important to note that the number of views in Youube is a metric tha says more about the popularity of the video than of its scientific quality. As Thelwall t al. (2012) found out, the suces of YouTube science videos depends on different ariables (e.g, entertainment value, particular topic of research, visual images, etc.) that are not necessrily related to is scientific value. Saurabh and Gautam (2019) also point out that the number of views increases as the channel becomes established and more videos are uploaded. They also conclude that medium-length videos are preferable, and that the initial part of the video needs to be exciting enough to keep the viewers' interest until the end.

Concerning the presenter, Sugimoto and Thelwall (2013) found that science and technology TED videos presented by academics were \*liked" more often than those by non-academics, which shows that scholars are not disadvantaged in this new media environment. Gonzalez Garcia et al. (2020) conclude that most successul YouTube videos feature a male, young scientific communicator who employs both animations and his public impression, i. the way he is perceived by the audience, as efective communication tools. Frobenius (2014) claims that successul YouTubers create the illusion of talking liveto teir audiences, and Perez-Torrs et al. (2018) suggest the key to success is being perceived as an equal.

Focusing now on one of the genres studied here, TED talks, Caliendo and Compagnone define this genre as "a series of short popularizing talks (of approximately $2 0 \ \mathrm { m i n } )$ , addressing a mass audience and delivered by top-level experts in a wide variety of domains (2014, p. 105). TED talks have been often described as a blend of other geres. For example Ludewig (2017) finds elements of sales pitches, educational communication, and memoirs, and she claims that these talks have gone through a process of performativization or theatricalization to become infotainment' or "edutainment'. Stil, TED conferences have ben criticized for elitism. However, a select group of videos is made available under a creative commons license through the TED website and YouTube (Sugimoto & Thelwall, 2013). As a result, there is a primary audience at the conferences, and a secondary audience for the video recordings of these conferences. These videos are carefull produced, sometimes even by professional filmmakers. Though smaller TEDx conferences (local and independently organized TED events) lack such elaboration, they stil follow these general guidelines (Ludewig, 2017). It is precisely one of the video-recorded TEDx Talks that concerns this study.

The other YouTube videos we consider in this study are PBS Space Time Videos. PBS Space Time is a subsidiary of Public Broadcasting Service (PBS),anonprofit organization which produce, broadcasts and distributes audiovisual products both on TV and online. As these types of videos are a more rcent phenomenon, to our knowledge, they have not yet been defined as a genre. They could fit into what some scholars have calle scifotainment or eutinment genre (Pere-Llantada, 2021). They difer from ED talks in their length (they ar ignificanly shorter), ther eelf fomality (they are signficantly more informal) and, aove all in the fact that they are not recorded live events but videos produced to be hosted online. In some ways they resemble other online scientific content like vlogs. However, we consider PBS Space Time videos to be different from vlogs, ince the main characteristic of vlogs is their spontaneity, mmediacy, loseness and amatur feel (Werner, 2012). PBS Space Time videos, onthe other hand, are rehearsed, taged and professionally produced. They also have a sequentiality and continuity that makes them similar to a TV series (e.g. they are released as "episodes').

# 1.4. A multimodal approach to online science dissemination genres

A multimodal approach to genre is based on the assumption that dfferent modes interact in communication to express meaning in the genre-creation process (Kress 2003; Kress & van Leeuwen, 2006). The concepts of mode and media can help understand the production and interretation proceses involved in genres. Jewit (2004) clarifies the difference between these concepts stating that modes enable representation of meaning, while media allow for the dissemination of meaning. When modes are combined to make meaning, they are orchestrated in multimodal ensembles (Kres, 2010). In addition, Norris (2004) claims that the number of modes in itselfis les significant than their ntensity (i.e. how much they are used) and the complext of the interrelationships among them. She refers to this as modal density. Moreover, when we look further into these interrelationships, we can discern if these modes are orchestrated into coherent ensembles, that is, whether they are used in a consistent way and do not contradict each other. We refer to this as modl coherence (Valeras Jurado, 2019. The concept f modal coherence is not asolute, and to a great extent it s relative and perspectival. However, it is measurable acording to some external, objective factors: a multimodal ensemble can be considered coherent if al modes contribute seamlessly to the communicative am at hand (e.g.inform, educate, etc., which normall implies following some genre conventions.

Online science dissemination genres are intrinsically multimodal, which call for a multimodal discourse analysis aproach. Boy et al. claim that

YouTube science videos are seen as well-organized multimodal arrangements consisting of a variety of visual and verbal modes like sills, moving images, text, spoken language, sounds, animations, graphics, etc. which is a much more complex system of communication than text only (2020, p. 4).

These authors have classfied scientific online videos according to the number of modes that are deployed to compose audiovisual scientific content, and to the primary function of the multimodal orchestration. Four basic types of cience videos are thus identified: In presentation films the speaker talks directly to the camera in a medium closeup shot and answers a limited number f scientific questions. In addition to spoken language, i features other modes such as text over visuals, background images, animations, gestures and facial expressions. Their trength lies mainly in their personalization abilit. In expert films the focus ies on an expert person who discusses a topical field of research. These videos contain more moving image material than platform-specific presentation modes (animations, inertio of user comments, addressing usrs, et.). Anmatio ilms shw artificial moving mages t llustrate roces, a problem, an issue, or a scientific theory. Finally, narrative explanatory films are based on a general question that is answered through arguments that follow logical reasoning. They are more complex and often contain elements that characterize the previous types, combining narrative and informativeelements by tellng an entertaining story while they give an explanation. They use mainly moving image material and have the highest number f cuts. Also, they can exercise strong attentional control. The two videos analyzed in this study might fit into this category.

# 1.5. The complex interplay of modes in online TED talks and PBS Space Time videos

A characteristic of the TED and Space Time videos is that they feature multimodal ensembles that comprise a wide array of modes. Some of these modes can be called embodied, and are controlled by the speaker (Norris 2004), while others are more related to the editing and production of the videos, and can be classfied as filmic modes, e.g. cuts or shots (Tseng & Bateman, 2010). Some authors have analyzed this multimodality in videos by grouping modes into layers (Burn, 2014; Farias et al., 2021; Jimenez Hurtado & Soler Gallego, 2013; Kzlof, 200; Vanoye, 1985). Vanoye (1985), for example, talks about a first aer in which communication takes place between the characters of a film, and a second layer in which communication happens between the filmmaker and the audience. This second layer isthe one that hosts filmic modes. These modes should not be neglected in the multimodal analysis of science dissemination videos, since they convey crucial meaning. For example, shots do not only specify the actual distance between the camera and the character (or, in our case, the speaker) but also the virtual distance between the speaker and the audience, simulating the prox. emics of interpersonal communication (Kress & van Leeuwen, 2006). Also, moving images can contribute to the narration and the interaction with the audience (Rowsell, 2014). In fact, Munoz Morcillo et al. claim that

[s]everal factors such as narrative strategies video editing techniques, and design tendencies with regard to cinematography, the number of shots, the kind of montage used, and even the spread use of sound design and special FX point to an increasing professionalism among science communicators independent of institutional or personal commitments. In general, it can be said that "supposed' amateurs are creating the visual language of science video communication. (2016, p. 1).

As Mayer (2014) sugests, in this complex, multilayered modal orchestration it is of crucial importance that layers do not compete or attention, but rather complement each other, or, in other words, that they are coherent.

It must be pointed out that this division into layers should be understood as an analytical tool to facilitate the multimodal analysis In realit, the two layers are intertwined and influence each other, especiall if the video is conceived to be distributed online and filmic modes are included in the design from the onset. For example, a particular type of shot or angle can affect the use of gaze or gestures.

This study explores the differences between replicated and web-native genres in online science videos adopting a multimodal approach. The existence of a second layer of filmic modes has been discussed in multimodal analyses f films, and the increasing importance of professional production (which implies the use of filmic modes) has been noted in previous studies of YouTube science videos. However, we believe that the highly elaborate multimodal ensembles orchestrated in these videos pose some unanswered questions that we aim to answer in this study:

- How do filmic modes have an impact on modal density?   
- How do the two modal layers (embodied and filmic) cohere with each other?   
- In which ways does this inform the definition of the two genres? To what extent is the online medium an integral part of these definitions?

# 2. Methodology

# 2.1. The dataset

In order to answer the research questions presented above, two science dissemination videos were selected from YouTube for further analysis. Both videos feature Dr. Matthew ODowd, an astrophysics researcher at the City Universty of New York and science communicator, talking about Fermi's Paradox and the probabilitie of finding alie life in the universe based on the experience on Earth. The first video is entitled Fermi's Paradox and the Psychology of Galactic Empiresl" and it portrays a face-to-face TEDx talk given at the Technische Universitat Wien in 2017 that was recorded and later on uploaded to YouTube after some editing on August 9, 2017. The video lasts $2 3 \mathrm { m i n }$ and 44 s and, at the time this paper was written, it had over 1.1 million views and 12 thousand likes. The video was uploaded by the channel TEDx Talks, which had 34.4 millon subscribers. The second video is entitled \*Why Haven't We Found Alien Life?" and it consists of an edited recording made by the channel PBs Space Time. This video has a duration of $1 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ and 33 s. It was uploaded to YouTube on Nov 5, 2015 and, at the time of writing, it had over 3 mllion views and about 35 thousand likes. Moreover, the channel PBs Space Time had 2.6 million subscribers. These videos were chosen as they entail two different representations of a rather similar content: a multi-camera recording f alive TED talk and an edited video made ad hoc for an online platorm. In this sense, and for the puroses of this paper, oth idos are sen as an online experience (as opposed to an in situ event in a TED talk, taking into account the affordances of the online medium. This means that we are not analyzing the TED talk as a live phenomenon, which from our point of view would represent a different communicative event and genre, and which has already attracted considerable attention from previous research (cf. introduction section in this paper).

Once the videos were selected, and after an initial viewing and analysis in terms of content, four short excerpts were extracted from each of the videos. These fragments constitute pairs which are similar i terms of content and therefore comparable. In this manner, a comparative analysis could be designed to explore the similarities and differences between the TEDx and the PBS Space Time videos. Table 1 below describes the dataset used in the analysis.

# 2.2. The multimodal annotation

The eight fragments were multimodally annotated using the software Multimodal Analysis Video (MAv) (O'Halloran et al., 2012) Following Kozlff (200) andVanoye (1985), two main layers of meaning were identified for the analysis: embodied modes, i.. verbal and non-verbal body-performed modes, and filmic modes, i. the modes arising from the editing process fthe YouTube videos. Whilst the former st of modes fully depends on the presenter, the latter i non-aligned to the speaker and is only perceived by the audience watching the videos.

Among the embodied modes, and in line with previous research on multimodal analyses of academic discourse (Bernad-Mecho, 2021), the following were taken into account: spoken language, paralanguage, gesture, gaze, proxemics, head movement and facial expression. For spoken language, i.e. what is verbalized, we considered the verbal transcription of the speech (i. entirely corpus-driven). As for paralanguage, the focus was put on the use of pauses, understood as silences that are longer than half a second; the presence of prominent strands of sech (e.g. a particular tone change, a salient tres, ec. that stands out from the rest); and the tempo in words per minute. For gestures, McNeills (1992) classfication was fllowed to identify iconic, metaphoric, deictic and beats gestures. We consider movements of the hands and arms as gestures, and they were clasified in relation to the ful ensemble in which they were integrated (i.e not just i relation to poken language). Our annotation system corresponds to Kendon's (2004) gesture units in the case of single gestures (that is, from relaxation moment to relaxation moment, including a preparation phase, a stroke and a recovery phase). In the case of repetitive gestures, however, we have annotated each iteration, which would be coser to what endon (2004) calls sture phrase (including the prearation and the stroke). Therefore, each iteration (or gesture phrase) may be classified differently. t is important to note that the unit used for annotation (gesture phrase or gesture unit) does not afect our quantitative analysis, since we do not count units, but the amount of time the speaker is gesturing relaive to the total length of the video. In the case of gaze, the direction of the gaze was marked (whether aimed at the audience, the camera, the floor, etc.). In proxemics, a basic distinction was made between a standing position and the moments in which the presenter was pacing. This distinction was corpus-driven and is i ine with previous studies (Bernad-Mecho & Fortanet-Gomez, 2019). As for head movements, nods, shakes and tilts were identified. Finally, eyebrow raisings, frowns and smiles were annotated to account for facial expression.

Within the editing layer, we drew from a series of studies incorporating filmic modes to their analyses (Desilla, 2012; Munoz Morcillo et al, 2016; Tseng, 2008; Tseng & Bateman, 2010 to include type of shot, angle, mise-en-scene, cuts, music, visual prompts, sound effects and video effect into our multmodal analys. For the analysis of shot, a clsscal taxonomy (Bowen, 2018) was adapted to fit the reality of the dataset, thus disingushing between close-us, medium clos-ups, medium shots, cowboy shots, medium ful shots, full hots and long hots. Furthermore, the angle of the camera was considered, whether it was a frontal or a lateral one. The analysis of mise-en-scene was limited to the decription of the backgrounds used in the videos, rardessof theelemens shown in thi ackground (e.g. slides, curtains, TED logo, digital prompts ec.) Similarly, cuts in the editing and the use of music were also annotated whenever they were present. Visual prompts refer o images and texs (e.. a full scren zoom in on the slides). Finall, sound and visual effects were also considered; these refer to any digital efects that were added during the editing. The selection of both embodied and filmic modes was corpus-driven.

Table 2 summarizes our framework for analysis. We argue that the selection of these specific modes allows for an in-depth multimodal exploration of the intricacies afforded by YouTube as an online platform.

Concerning interrater score, the authors first agreed on the analysis framework shown in Table 2. Then each author annotated one video (TED or PBS). Finally, results were exchanged, inconsistencies in annotation homogenized and disagreements solved. Most of these disagreements concerned the exact type of gesture and shot, but not the semiotic modes orchestrated in the ensemble.

# 2.3. The analysis

Following the research questions described above, athree-step analysis of the data was carried out. First, a quantitative approach towards modal density was implemented using the tool State Machine in MAV. This tool makes it possble to obtain percentages of use for each of the modes over the total duration of the cip, for instance, to ee the amount of time taken up by metaphoric gestures, or the amount of time music i present in the video. Some modes, however, cannot support an analysis of density such as the one suggested here. This i the case of tempo (within paralanguage), mise-en-scene, and cuts. For the former, an analysis of the average number of words per minute was carried out instead. As for mise-en-scene -or setting-a further qualitative analysis was needed, since there is always a mise-en-scene throughout the clips; what is important in the case of this mode is to figure out how the specific seting con tributes to the multimodal ensemble. Consequently, this analysis was carried out within the analysis of multimodal coherence (see below). Lastly, cuts consist of editing decisions to join togther twostrands of spech that were recorded separately. These donot have a realisic quantifiable duration (they last 1/25 of a second each); therefore, instead of accounting for a percentage of use over the duration of the clip, the total number of instances was analyzed and an average number of cuts per minute was calculated for each of the clips.

The second part of analysis focuses on multimodal coherence. From a qualitative perspective, we examined the orchestration of multimodal ensembles to discern whether the two layers of analysis (embodied and filmic) cohere with each other or whether they are contradictory. For example, if a medium shot is used for a moment in which the presenter is being expressive by using gestures, prominent intonation and facial expression, we would argue that both layers cohere, as the filmic choice of shot contributes to fully showing the presenter's embodied ensemble. On the other hand, if a long shot was chosen, some of these embodied modes would not be clearly perceived by YouTube viewers and, therefore, the layers might lack coherence.

To end, these online science videos were classfied according to Shepherd and Watters (1998) configuration of the evolution of digital genres to confirm our hypothesis regarding the degree of digitalization of each genre.

# 3. Results and discussion

# 3.1. Modal density in double-layered multimodal ensembles

The first research question asked how multimodal ensembles were affcted in terms of modal density with the inclusion of a second layer of analysis, i.e the filmic modes. To answer this question, aquantitative analysis of the modes co-occurring in the multimodal ensembles was carried out using State Machine in MAV. Table 3 below provides average quantitative data on the use of each mode for both, the TEDx and PBS Space Time videos. The data are generally expressed in percentages over the total running time of the cips. In other words, percentages show how much time is devoted to each mode. As discussed in the methodological section above, three exceptions are to be considered: tempo is computed in average words/minute, mise-en-scene will only be explored from a qualitative point of view in the ollowing section; and cuts are quantified in average number of instances/minute. Furthermore, t is important to remark that some modes may overlap. Thus, for example, a gesture could be interpreted both as abeat and as a metaphoric gesture atthe same time. In such case, the specific percentages for each type of gesture wil take this intoaccount. However, in the total amount of gestures, only the moments in which the presenter is using gestures willbe computed, as opposed to the moments in which he is not using any gestures, i.e. a gesture carrying two functions willonly be counted as one. Finall, the averages are calulated in proportion to the length of each of the clips. In this sense, the values produced by onger clis wil have a higher weight on the average than those arising from shorter ones.

Within theembodied modes, the quantitative data shows obvious ifferences between the two formats, as the PBS Space Time video appears to be much more modally dense. Within the paralinguistic features, for instance, pauses are common in the TEDx video, accounting for $1 7 . 6 8 \%$ of the time, while they are almost non-existent in the PBs Space Time video $( 0 . 5 4 \% )$ . As for the tempo, the average of words/minute is approximately $5 0 \%$ higher in the PBS Space Time video (180.49 vs. 119.89 words/minute). Both of these data show a tendency to mark a more intense rhythm in the PBS Space Time video, in line with what is expected from YouTubers to create successful videos (Welbourne & Grant, 2016). In fact, a faster tempo might improve audience attention and persuasiveness (Chambers, 2001; Miler et al., 1976; Smith & Shaffer, 1995). Finall, PBS Space Time clips contain twice as many prominent uses of language as TEDx's $2 0 . 3 6 \%$ in TEDx vs. $4 2 . 5 8 \%$ in PBS Space Time). This higher density is also observed in other embodied modes such as the total use of gestures $( 6 2 . 7 2 \%$ in TEDx vs. $9 5 . 5 8 \%$ in PBS Space Time), head movements ( $6 . 8 9 \%$ vs. $5 5 . 7 9 \%$ and facial expression $4 . 3 0 \%$ vs. $3 6 . 1 8 \%$ respectively). These modes seem to work in combination and serve as frequent emphatic rhythm markers. However, these ampledifferences, as we willdiscus below, might be the result of choices in the filmic modes: in the TED video, even if the presenter is performing complex embodied ensemble, they arealmost imperceptible to the online audience if a long shot is chose for th camera. ill, eeant differnes are al found in the diction f gamost fully fosd n the camera in the PBS Space Time video $- 9 2 . 3 5 \% .$ , while mostly focused on the audience in the TEDx video $- 7 0 . 5 0 \%$ . It is important to remark at this point that both videos are seen as YouTube videos. Indeed, the viewer isnot attending a face-to-face TEDx talk, but they are watching an online recording. From this point of view, it can be argued that the presenter i only directly addressing the real audience (the online viewers) in the case of the PBS Space Time clip.

When considering the filmic layer of modes, several results stand out. The type of shot is one f such: while medium shots or cowboy shots (a slightly wider medium shot) are preferred in the PBS Space Time video, totaling $6 6 . 2 \%$ of the total duration of the clips, full shots and long shots are more common in the TEDx video, adding up to $5 2 . 5 5 \%$ of the duration of the clips. When looking at the use of angles, only frontal angle fully showing the presenter are chosen in PBS Space Time while the TEDx video combines both frontal shots $( 6 9 . 9 6 \% )$ and lateral shots $( 2 4 . 0 3 \% )$ . Note that the remaining $6 . 0 1 \%$ refers to moments in which the presenter is not portrayed (for instance when showing a slide in full-screen). In general, frontal medium shots contribute to beter conveying meaning through the embodied modes. On the conrary, longer shots offer awider view of th setting fr instance, used in the TEx vide to include part of the background presentation within the frame). Cuts are only used in the PBs Space Time videos; at an average rate of 2.98 instances per minute. These contribute to a swifter montage without pauses, emulating operating modern television conventions such as the MTV-style editing (Dancyger, 2011). This kind of editing is usually also accompanied by music (present in $9 7 . 5 3 \%$ of the PBS Space Time clips) while this mode is only present in the outro of the TEDx video $\left( 0 . 8 3 \% \right)$ . Similarly, visual prompts like the use of text and image are prevalent in the PBS Space Time videos $( 9 0 . 4 7 \% )$ while they are almost negligible in the TEDx video (5.66). As for the remaining filmic modes, they are quasi-exclusive of the PBS Space Time format. Sound and visual ffects are almost non-exstent i the TEDx talk, while they are very common in PBS Space Time $3 0 . 9 8 \%$ for sound and $4 2 . 3 7 \%$ for visual effects). Again, this kind of edition follows the standards of successful popular science videos on YouTube (Munoz Morcillo et al., 2016)

In conclusion, PBS Space Time clips are denser, not only in terms of quantity and frequency of modes, but also in terms of complexity and the interactions among them, which contributeto building up a more coherent format. The level of professionalism in the production as wel as the complexit of montage are reflected through a higher density in the filmic layer of modes, exploiting the affordances of the medium. Nevertheles, further qualitatie analyses need to be carried out to account for the implicatures of specific multimodal ensembles and their conveyed meanings. These analyses are provided in the section below.

# 3.2. Modal coherence in online science videos

Our second research question inquires into modal coherence in the TEDx and PBS Space Time videos. In particular, we focus on coherence across the two layers of modes, i.e. embodied and filmic (Mayer, 2014). The analys revealed that, in general, PBS Space Time shows greater coherence across the embodied and the editing layer, while in the TEDx video the two layers frequently contradict each other and do not always work jointly towards the same communicative aim. Some examples are offered in the following paragraphs.

The type of shot and camera angle in the TEDx video is very often not coherent with the rest of the embodied modes. There are examples of long shots that prevent the correct visualization of gestures, face expression and head movements for the audience watching the video, which in turn jeopardize the expression of attitudinal meaning. It is true that the speaker might be orchestrating coherent ensembles that convey this meaning to people in the conference room; however, these cannot be identified by the online audience. I contrast, PBs Space Time shots are carefully chosen to exploit the affordances of embodied modes, for example shifting from a long to a medium shot and focusing on the speaker's gestures and face expression when he expresses his personal opinion. Unlike in the TEDx video, the speaker in PBS Space Time addresses the camara directly. In this sense, the interaction between embodied multimodal ensembles and the actual -online- audience in the TEDx video is constrained by the choices in filmic modes. Fig. 1 compares the use of shot and camera angle in the two videos.

When looking at embodied modes, we note that they are more coherent among themselves in both videos. For example, nods very frequently coincide with gaze directed at the (physically preset) audience in what seems an attempt t see agreement (Fig. 1) Similarly, frowning and eyebrow raising also coincide to a great extent with gaze directed at the audience. This can be interpreted as an attempt to show the audience what reaction the speaker is expecting from them. A further example is that metaphoric gestures are coherent with spoken language. Very frequently they offr a visual representation of what isconveyed with words and mostly coincide with gazing at the audience, as if checking that the message is getting across (see Fig. 2).

Visual prompts in the TEDx video have a delay with respect to embodied modes, as they entail editing decisions taken during the recording and not during postproduction. similar type of incoherence i found in the mise-en-scene when the TEDx video uses a long shot in which a slide can be see in the background which does not necessarly complement or support what the peaker is saying at that moment. No examples of these mismatches are found in the PBS Space Time clips. In fact, visual promptseamlessly cohere with embodied modes such as spoken language. Fig. 3, for example, shows moments in which the speaker explains the origin of multicellular life. While i TEDx the slide on the background just shows a question mark, the visual prompts n PBS clerly support, and even duplicate, the information conveyed through spoken language.

What these results suggest i that editing and production are more planned and professionalized in the Ps Space Time video. The production of the TEDx video is limited in terms of capturing the simultaneit of modes and the complexity of the full modal ensemble. To mention two ilustrative examples, capturing the slides in the background and speaker at the same time requires a very long shot which makes embodied modes les effective, and a close up on slides means leaving out the presenter. PBS Space Time clips can overcome these limitations. For example, gestures are intentionally performed around the upper area of the torso to keep them under camera frame. In addition, the production and editing of PBs Space Time are significantly more complex. This has been referred to by Munoz Morcillo et al. (2016) as moderate complexity of production and high complexity of montage. As indicated in the previous section, th  Saceime vide nudes sound effts, visual efets and cts to ensure a lively hthm, none f hich ar resent in the TEDx video.

# 3.3. Implications for genre analysis

Lastly, the third research question aims at deriving implications for genre analysis and the definitions of the genres at stake. The findings discussed in the previous sections can help us inform and refine the definitions of TED and PBS science videos as genres. Taking into account Shepherd and Watters's(1998) classification of digital genres and the results of our multimodal analysis, we can describe these genres as follows:

The PBS Space Time video, as hypothesized in the inroduction, i a novel genre that originates directly in the online environment facilitated by YouTube. As such, this video makes good use f all the afordances of its medium and exploits both embodied and filmic modes to the fulest. The video is not only denser in terms of number and intensity of modes used, but aso more coherent inits orchestration of modes.

The TEDx video, on the other hand, sems to be a good example of a replicated genre evolving from the live TED talk that is using this new medium to reach a wider audience. However, this adaptation to the online setting is not complete and it entail several drawbacks. Thus athough the video incorporates filmic modes such as different camera shots and angles, their use is significantly more modest than in the PBS video. This evidently shows that filmic modes are not an integral part of the genre since they are not considered from the onset, and, as a consequence, their use is les coherent and contributes les to the communicatie aim of the gere.

Understanding the use of filmic modes becomes essential for the producer of research dissemination videos to ensure a coherence and effective use of modes in multimodal ensembles. Allin al, the TEDx video may be sen as being at an earlier stage of development as a digital genre It can be argued that one reason for this is that they are recordings of live events' It can further be argued that, to become fully developed, digital genres should be conceived as digital content from the start and oriented to an online audience. In short, the two genres are affected by the online medium and its affordances. The online medium (YouTube) serves just as a mere vehicle for the dissemination of science o maximize its impact. I can also be argued that the PBS video is actively creating a certan type of viewer, which wil become a trat of the genre as it develops into a wellestablished digital genre. Both are topics that desere further research.

# 4. Conclusion

In this paper we have analyzed two example of online science videos in which scientific content i recontextualized and adapted to a new audience and medium: a recorded TEDx tlk and a PBs Space Time video. We have aproached these videos from a multimodal discourse analysis perspective to unveil the complex orchestration of modes that takes place in them. Drawing from multimodal studies of films, we have determined the existence of two layers of modes in online science videos, which we have called embodied and filmic modes, respectively. The former are deployed by the speaker, whil the latter are added to the ensemble during production and editing. Our analys shed ligt on thre main ass fthis mutimodal chetration: i) the way  ffects modl dy ) the way t affects modal coherence, ii) what this can tell us about TED and PBS videos as genres.

Our findings show that online science videos are more modally dense as a result of filmic modes being incorporated into the ensemble. In addition, we also find that the use of filmic modes requires some degre of expertise and know-how in order to keep the coherence of the multimodal ensemble. The PBs Space Time video that is part of our dat reveals itelf as denser and more coherent that the TED video. In the case of the TED video, we note a modest use of production and editing, and a lack of coherence betwen embodied and filmic modes. In addition, the multimodal ensembles deploy a use of embodied modes that is perceived as addresse to the audience that is physically present rather than to the online audience, which might negatively affect how meaning reaches the viewer. In fact, aclear acknowledgement of the recording devices in the conference room can increase engagement in the viewers as suggested by Xia and Hafner (2021). Having this idea in mind, we believe that research on the multimodal deployment of engagement strategies in online videos would yield enlightening results in further research. Likewise, we suggest that higher modal density does not necessrily imply a higher cognitive load if there is modal coherence, because all modes contribute seamlessly to the same communicative efect. In fact, there are results from previous liteature that point in this direction (Chambers, 2001; Munoz Morcil et al., 2016; Welbourne & Grant, 2016). These findings confirm our hypothesis that the two genres are at a different stage of devel. opment in Shepherd and Watters's (1998) classfication of cybergenre. The PBS Space Time video is a novel cybergenre fully adapted to the Youube medum and exploiting all ts ffordances. The TED vide, on the other hand, is arelicated nre that is sill adapting to the new medium and makes a less efficient use of the filmic modes afforded by YouTube.

One of the limitations of the study is the absence of input from online viewers, which might complement our interpretations. Furthermore, given the limited size of the datast the results of hs stdy cannot be geralied. Stil, they can pave th way for arger scale studies, which could incude, mong others, a more rigorous linguistic analysiss part of the mode spoken anguage, or the analysis of full videos in order to fully grasp the macrostructure of the genre. These can provide a deeper understanding of the fast changes originated by the ever-growing trend towards science dissemination and popularization. These changes, as shown in this paper, go beyond the need to recontextualize scientific content. They also involve the use of new media with new semiotic modes and affor dances, as well as new genres. In this scenario, multimodal literacy becomes acrucial sill among science communicators, who now more than ever need to skilfully orchestrate increasingly complex and multi-layered multimodal ensembles.
