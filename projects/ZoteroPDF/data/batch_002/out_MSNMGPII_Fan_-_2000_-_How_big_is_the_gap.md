# HOW BIG IS THE GAP AND HOW TO NARROW IT? AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE ACTIVE AND PASSIVE VOCABULARY KNOWLEDGE OF L2 LEARNERS

MAY FAN Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

# Abstract

It is generally believed that L2 learners know more words of the target language than they can actually use them. The aim of this study is to find out more about this gap and the ways to narrow it. The subjects under study were several groups of sub-degree students and the instruments for data collection included an active and a passive vocabulary test as well as a questionnaire. There was no evidence to indicate a consistent ratio between active and passive vocabulary knowledge and the relationship betwcen them has been found to be more complicated than it appears to be. On the other hand, learning strategies which help to enhance active vocabulary knowledge have been identified. These and other findings of the study will be of interest to researchers in similar areas as well EAP teachers who are concerned about improving the vocabulary knowledge of their students.

The author is indebted to the Hong Kong Polytechnic University for funding the project and Professor Paul Nation for providing the long version of the Word Levels Test used in the study.

# Introduction

Vocabulary has generally been classified into receptive/passive and productive/active vocabulary. Nattinger (1988:62) describes passive vocabulary knowledge as the understanding of the meaning of words and storing words in memory and active vocabulary knowledge as the retrieval of words from memory by using them in appropriate situations. According to Nation (1990), passive vocabulary knowledge means the ability to recognize a word and recall its meaning when it is encountered, while active vocabulary knowledge is the ability to write the needed vocabulary at the appropriate time (Nation 1990:5). Read (2000:155-156) highlights the importance to define clearly the meaning of receptive and productive knowledge and what is being assessed in vocabulary tests.

While some researchers suggest a dichotomy between productive/active and receptive/ passive vocabulary, others propose an interdependent relationship between them. Clark (1993:264) contends that comprehension precedes production and that children can understand words before they can produce them. Similarly, Meara (1990:153) suggests that active and passive vocabulary are 'qualitatively different' in that passive vocabulary 'can only be assessed if appropriate external stimulation is available' whereas active vocabulary 'does not require any external stimulus, but can be activated by other words'. On the other hand, some researchers are of the opinion that it is more appropriate to look at the differences between active and passive vocabulary knowledge as a degree of familiarity. For example, Melka (1997:100) proposes to view the distance between reception and production along a continuum' on the ground that though reception may precede production, 'the gap between the two notions is not large and it varies and shifts according to linguistic or pragmatics factors'.

Regarding the extent of the gap between the two types of vocabulary, discrepancies have been reported. According to Chamberlain 1965 ( in Melka 1997:92), the passive vocabulary of the averaging English speaker is 5 times larger than his active vocabulary. However, Hartmann 1946 (in Melka op.cit.) reports that the passive vocabulary of the Year Two university students is about 4 times of their active vocabulary. As for L2 learners, it has been estimated that their passive vocabulary is double (or more) the size of their active vocabulary (Eringa 1974 in Melka op.cit.). In fact, Nation (1990:48) reports that \*rough estimates indicate that learning a word productively is $50 \%$ to $100 \%$ more difficult than learning it receptively'. In a recent study, Laufer (1998) indicates a ratio of $89 \%$ and $73 \%$ with the $1 0 ^ { \mathfrak { a } }$ and $1 1 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ graders respectively, suggesting that the gap between active and passive vocabulary increases with progress in learning, which is in conflict with the findings of Morgan and Oberdeck's study in 1930, which found a narrower gap at the end of the experimental stage. Laufer (1998) also finds that passive and 'controlled active scores' correlate well with each other. That is to say, students who are more proficient in passive vocabulary are also more proficient in active vocabulary.

# Research Questions

While Laufer (1998) focuses on the development of the size of active and passive vocabulary, this study intends to explore further the gap between active and passive vocabulary knowledge and to identify vocabulary learning strategies which help to narrow the gap, an area which has rarely been looked at. The research questions are as follows:

1. Is there a positive relationship between English proficiency and active and passive vocabulary knowledge?   
2. Is there a positive relationship between active and passive vocabulary knowledge?   
3. Of the words L2 learners recognize, how many of them can they recall?   
4. What are the strategies which can help narrow the gap between the two types of vocabulary? In other words, what are the strategies which correlate positively with active vocabulary knowledge?

Following Read (2000:155), \*active' and 'passive' vocabulary knowledge assessed in this study has the same meaning of 'recognition' and 'recall' respectively. Recognition means the test-takers are presented with the target word and are asked to show that they understand its meaning, whereas in the case of recall they are provided with some stimulus designed to elicit the target word from their memory' (Read op.cit.)

# Method

This section will describe the subjects, the instruments for data collection and the procedure involved.

# The Subjects

The subjects under study were 138 Higher Diploma students who just began their first year in the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. About $70 \%$ of them were boys and $30 \%$ girls. The composition of the subjects is as follows:

Table 1 Composition of Subjects   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Groups</td><td>Disciplines</td><td>No. of Students</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Engineering Surveying (ES)</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>-ditto-</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>-ditto-</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Shipping &amp; Management Studies (SMS)</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>-ditto-</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>-ditto-</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Building Technology &amp; Management (BTM)</td><td>18</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>-ditto-</td><td>17</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>-ditto-</td><td>19</td></tr><tr><td>Total</td><td></td><td>138</td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 1 shows that the 9 groups of students under study were from three disciplines. For each discipline, there were two groups from the same academic year and one group from the following year. The English proficiency of the students as indicated by their results in the Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination (HKALE), a public university entrance examination, was rather low as shown in the following table.

Table 2 English Results (Grades) in HKALE   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>C</td><td>D</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>U</td><td>Total</td></tr><tr><td>Frequency</td><td></td><td>1</td><td></td><td>19</td><td>50</td><td>29</td><td>4</td><td>103</td></tr><tr><td> Percentages</td><td></td><td>1.0</td><td></td><td>18.4</td><td>48.5</td><td>28.2</td><td>3.9</td><td>100.0</td></tr></table></body></html>

$\mathbf { F } { = }$ Fail; U=Unclassified

Table 2 shows that out of the 138 students, only 103 $( 7 4 \% )$ of them reported having taken the HKALE. While just $1 \%$ of the students got a B grade, as many as $33 \%$ of them failed in the examination. The English proficiency of the students from the 3 disciplines is summarized as follows:

Table 3 English Proficiency of Students from the Three Disciplines in Percentages   

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2">Disciplines</td><td colspan="7">HKALE Grades</td><td rowspan="2">Total %</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>B</td><td>c</td><td>D</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>U</td></tr><tr><td>ES</td><td>0</td><td>2.5</td><td>0</td><td>7.7</td><td>35.9</td><td>46.2</td><td>7.7</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>SMS</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>32.4</td><td>64.7</td><td>2.9</td><td>0</td><td>100</td></tr><tr><td>BTM</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>16.7</td><td>46.7</td><td>33.3</td><td>3.3</td><td>100</td></tr></table></body></html>

The above table shows that of the students who reported their results, $9 7 . 1 \%$ of the SMS students, $6 3 . 4 \%$ of the BTM students and 46.1 of the ES students passed in English in the HKALE. The SMS students were obviously more proficient than the other two groups, which agreed with the entry requirements of these three sub-degree programs. For the purposes of the study, only students who reported their English results in HKALE were included in the analysis.

# Instruments

The instruments for data collection included an Active and a Passive Vocabulary Test as well as a Vocabulary Learning Strategies Questionnaire.

# The Passive Vocabulary Test

This test served two purposes. First, it helped to give an overall picture of the passive vocabulary knowledge of the students, including knowledge of general and academic vocabulary. The more important purpose was to identify the vocabulary items commonly known to each of the nine groups in the study so as to prepare the Active Vocabulary Test. The Word Levels Test kindly supplied by Professor Paul Nation was used in the study on the ground that it is a test on passive vocabulary. This test is similar to the Vocabulary Levels Test in Nation (1990:265-272) except that it is a much longer test, with 72 instead of 18 questions at each word level. Also, only the 2000, 3000 and the University Word List levels (UWL) were included in the test as the other two levels were considered too difficult for the students under study. In brief, vocabulary at the 2000 and 3000 levels are frequency words and items at the UwL level are academic vocabulary. For each question in the test, 6 vocabulary items and three meanings are provided. Testees are required to select three items (from the 6) to match the three meanings.

# The Active Vocabulary Test

In order to measure the gap between active and passive vocabulary knowledge, an Active Vocabulary Test was designed for each of the nine groups of students based on their results in the Word Levels Test. The vocabulary items in the Word Levels Test found to be recognized by all the students in each individual group became the test items in the Active Vocabulary Test for that particular group. The aim of this test was to find out the proportion of known/recognized words they could recall. Testees are required to supply a word to complete a sentence and the first one, two or three English alphabets of the target word are given to the students depending on the word length. Also, the meanings of the tested words would remain the same as those in the Word Levels Test. This test is similar in design to the one described as 'controlled active vocabulary test' in Laufer (1998).

# The Vocabulary Learning Strategies Questionnaire

The Questionnaire contains 60 vocabulary learning strategies. The main aim of the questionnaire was to identify the strategies which could enhance active vocabulary knowledge i.e. strategies which could help to narrow the gap between the two types of vocabulary. The design of the questionnaire was to elicit information firstly about how frequently the students use a certain strategy and secondly how useful they perceive the same strategy. The students were asked to respond to a five point scale from 'never' to 'very often' in respect of the former and from \*not useful' to 'extremely useful' in respect of the latter.

# Procedures

All the students under study were asked to complete the Word Levels Test at the beginning of the academic year. Right after that, they were required to fill in the Vocabulary Learning Strategies Questionnaire. They then took the respective Active Vocabulary Test specially designed for their group several weeks later. The two tests were completed in the classroom under the supervision of the teacher.

For the rating of the Word Levels Test, one mark was awarded for each correct answer. As for the rating of the Active Vocabulary Test, only those words which were used grammatically and with correct spelling were considered to be right answers. This is because the ability to use words in production embraces the knowledge of using them grammatically with the right spelling. This method of rating was therefore different from that in Laufer (1998) where only 'non-words' were considered incorrect answers.

# Findings

# Results of the Word Levels Test.

First of all, the results of the passive vocabulary test were calculated by obtaining the mean scores and mean scores in percentages of each of the three word levels and they are reported in the table below:

Table 4 Overall Results of the Word Levels Test   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Word Levels</td><td>Mean Scores</td><td>Percentages</td></tr><tr><td>2000</td><td>62.12</td><td>86.28</td></tr><tr><td>3000</td><td>48.16</td><td>66.89</td></tr><tr><td>University Word List</td><td>45.72</td><td>63.51</td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 4 shows that the students were rather weak in vocabulary at the 3000 and University Word List levels. The drastic drop in mean scores from the 2000 to the 3000 level (62.12 to 48.16) was quite unexpected as both the 2000 and 3000 levels were frequency words and one might expect closer scores between the two levels.

Passive Vocabulary Knowledge and English Proficiency

Further analysis of the data indicated that there was a positive relationship between passive vocabulary knowledge and English proficiency.

Table 5 Relationship between Passive Vocabulary Test scores and HKALE English Results (mean scores in percentages)   

<html><body><table><tr><td></td><td>D grade or above</td><td>E grade</td><td>F or below</td></tr><tr><td>2000 level</td><td>93.19</td><td>89.06</td><td>83.71</td></tr><tr><td>3000 level</td><td>84.31</td><td>71.67</td><td>59.22</td></tr><tr><td>UWL level</td><td>82.22</td><td>70.61</td><td>56.04</td></tr><tr><td>Average</td><td>86.57</td><td>77.11</td><td>66.99</td></tr></table></body></html>

The above table shows that the D grade students performed better than the E grade students who in turn performed better than the F grade students at all the three word levels, suggesting that students who were more proficient in the L2 had a larger passive vocabulary, which did not come as a surprise.

Relationship between Active and Passive Vocabulary Knowledge

In order to find out the extent of the gap between active and passive vocabulary knowledge, it was decided to look at the ratio between words that could be recognized and those that could be recalled. To this end, it was necessary to identify the vocabulary items recognized by the students. The following table reports the number of words recognized by all the students in each of the 9 groups in the Word Levels Test.

Table 6 Items Known by All students in Each of the 9 Groups in the Word Levels Test $\mathbf { \left( M a x { = } 2 1 6 \right) }$   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Groups</td><td>Recognized Words</td><td>Percentages</td></tr><tr><td>5 (SMS)</td><td>59</td><td>27.3</td></tr><tr><td>4 (SMS)</td><td>51</td><td>23.6</td></tr><tr><td>6 (SMS)</td><td>51</td><td>23.6</td></tr><tr><td>8 (BTM)</td><td>44</td><td>20.3</td></tr><tr><td>2 (ES)</td><td>31</td><td>14.6</td></tr><tr><td>3 (ES)</td><td>27</td><td>12.5</td></tr><tr><td>1 (ES)</td><td>25</td><td>11.6</td></tr><tr><td>7 (BTM)</td><td>22</td><td>10.1</td></tr><tr><td>9 (BTM)</td><td>15</td><td>6.90</td></tr></table></body></html>

The above table shows for example 59 items were known by all the students in group 5(SMS), which was about. $2 7 . 3 \%$ of the total number of words in the Word Levels Test. Some students in this group might have knowledge of more than 59 words but only the items known by all students in the group were selected for the study. The same applies to the other 8 groups. The SMS students were found to have recognized more words, confirming the positive relationship between language proficiency and passive vocabulary knowledge. Based on the above information, nine different Active Vocabulary Tests were constructed. Students were tested of their ability to recall words they could recognize. It was expected that the groups who were more proficient in English and who could recognize more words would outperform the other groups. This assumption, however, was not substantiated by the results of the Active Vocabulary Test.

Table 7 Results of the Active Vocabulary Tests and Ratios between Active and Passive Vocabulary   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Groups</td><td>Recognized Words</td><td>Recalled Words</td><td>Ratio (%)</td></tr><tr><td>5 (SMS)</td><td>59</td><td>48</td><td>81.3</td></tr><tr><td>8 (BTM)</td><td>44</td><td>34</td><td>77.3</td></tr><tr><td>1 (ES)</td><td>25</td><td>19</td><td>76.0</td></tr><tr><td>2 (ES)</td><td>31</td><td>21</td><td>67.7</td></tr><tr><td>9 (BTM)</td><td>15</td><td>10</td><td>66.7</td></tr><tr><td>4 (SMS)</td><td>51</td><td>34</td><td>66.6</td></tr><tr><td>3 (ES)</td><td>27</td><td>17</td><td>63.0</td></tr><tr><td>7 (BTM)</td><td>22</td><td>13</td><td>59.1</td></tr><tr><td>6 (SMS)</td><td>51</td><td>27</td><td>53.0</td></tr><tr><td>Average</td><td>36</td><td>25</td><td>69.4</td></tr></table></body></html>

Table 7 indicates for example that all the students in group 5 (SMS) were able to recall in the Active Vocabulary Test 48 of the 59 words they recognized in the Passive Vocabulary Test and the ratio between the two types of vocabulary is therefore 48:59 i.e. $8 1 . 3 \%$ . Several points could be made here. It seems that there was no consistent relationship between English proficiency and active vocabulary knowledge. For instance, the SMS students, who were more proficient in English than the ES and BTM students (see table 3) were not consistent in maintaining this superiority. Among the three SMS groups, only one group (group 5) scored the highest in the Active Vocabulary Test, being able to recall 48 words. This SMS group was unexpectedly followed by a BTM group (group 8) who scored as high as another SMS group (group 4). Similarly, with regard to the relationship between active and passive vocabulary knowledge, while groups 5 (SMS), 4 (SMS) and 6(SMS) ranked top three in the recognition of vocabulary (see table 6), only group 5 (SMS) remained the top group in recall whereas the ranking of groups 4(SMS) and 6 (SMS) dropped to 6th and 9th respectively. On the other hand, group 9 (BTM), which recognized the smallest number of words ranked 5th in the Active Vocabulary Test.

When the ratios between active and passive vocabulary were looked at, it was surprising to find a mix of the 3 disciplines not only at the top but also the middle and the bottom streams. Groups 5(SMS), 8 (BTM) and 1 (ES) ranked the top three, groups 2 (ES), 9 (BTM) and 4(SMS) ranked the middle three and groups 3(ES), 7(BTM) and 6(SMS) ranked the bottom three. These findings indicate that the extent of the gap between the two types of vocabulary may not be related to English proficiency and nor is it related to the size of passive vocabulary. As for the ratio between active and passive vocabulary knowledge, it varied across the nine groups, ranging from $8 1 . 3 \%$ to $5 3 \%$ , with an average of $6 9 . 2 \%$

# Strategies to Narrow the Gap

The other main aim of the study was to look for strategies which enhance active vocabulary knowledge and subsequently help to narrow the gap between the two types of vocabulary. To this end, Pearson correlation analysis was conducted between responses to the questionnaire and scores in the Active Vocabulary Test. Findings indicated that among the 60 vocabulary strategies under investigation, seven of them were found to have a positive and significant correlation with the scores in the Active Vocabulary Test.

Table 8 The Seven Vocabulary Learning Strategies Correlated Positively and Significantly with Active Vocabulary Test Scores.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Questions B3</td><td>Correlations 0.178*</td><td>Vocabulary Learning Strategies. I learn new words from course books,. handouts or anything written in English. inside school.</td></tr><tr><td>B6</td><td>0.247*</td><td>I increase my English vocabulary by reading. stories, newspapers, magazines etc. outside. class.</td></tr><tr><td>B7</td><td>0.195*</td><td>I play games in English to learn more new words.</td></tr><tr><td>C3</td><td>0.195*</td><td>When I meet new words in reading, I guess their meaning and then Iook up the dictionary..</td></tr><tr><td>G1</td><td>0.205*</td><td>I group words that are related to help myself remember them.</td></tr><tr><td>G4</td><td>0.240*</td><td>I group together words and expressions that are used in a certain situation e.g. Bank: cash,</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>0.203*</td><td>cheque, open an account etc... I repeatedly say the word in my mind..</td></tr></table></body></html>

\* Correlation is significant at the 0.05 level (2-tailed).

Strategies B3 and B6 are related to the sources of vocabulary both inside and outside school. Strategy C3 is about establishing the meaning of words, both by guessing and by consulting the dictionary. Strategies B7, G1, G4 and I3 are connected with the ways of learning new words. These findings will be discussed in greater detail in the last section of this article.

A following attempt was made to find out how the students rated these strategies in terms of Frequency of Use and Perceived Usefulness and the findings are reported in the table below.

Table 9 Rank Order of the Seven Vocabulary Learning Strategies in terms of Frequency of Use and Perceived Usefulness.   

<html><body><table><tr><td rowspan="2">Strategies</td><td colspan="2">Frequency of Use.</td><td colspan="2">Perceived Usefulness</td></tr><tr><td>Means</td><td>Rank Order (Total : 60)</td><td>Means</td><td>Rank Order (Total : 60)</td></tr><tr><td>B3</td><td>3.38</td><td>7</td><td>3.60</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>C3</td><td>3.30</td><td>12</td><td>4.01</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>B6</td><td>3.07</td><td>25</td><td>3.92</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>G1</td><td>2.64</td><td>42</td><td>3.36</td><td>35</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>2.54</td><td>45</td><td>3.11</td><td>42</td></tr><tr><td>G4</td><td>2.49</td><td>46</td><td>3.17</td><td>41</td></tr><tr><td>B7</td><td>2.29</td><td>53</td><td>2.99</td><td>46</td></tr></table></body></html>

The means of the Frequency of Use ranged from 3.38 to 2.29 indicating that the student did not often use these strategies. However, it is interesting to note that the means of Perceived Usefulness suggested that students considered these strategies quite useful. The ranking of the strategies also confirmed this discrepancy. For example, B6 'I increase my English vocabulary by reading stories, newspapers, magazines etc. outside class' ranked 25th in Frequency of Use but $2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ in Perceived Usefulness. Similarly, C3 When I meet new words in reading, I guess their meaning and then look up the dictionary' ranked the highest in Perceived Usefulness.

# Discussion

This study set out to explore the gap between active and passive vocabulary knowledge and identify vocabulary learning strategies which help to narrow this gap.

First, there seems to be no consistent relationship between language proficiency and the two types of vocabulary knowledge. While findings have indicated that students who are more proficient in the L2 have a larger passive vocabulary, evidence is perplexing regarding their ability to recall more of the words they can recognize. Some proficient students under study did well in the Active Vocabulary Test but some of them did very badly.

Related to the above findings is the relationship between active and passive vocabulary knowledge. While previous research indicated a positive relationship between these two types of vocabulary knowledge (Laufer 1998), evidence in the present study seems to be conflicting. Among the students who were able to recognize more words, only some of them were found to be able to recall more of these words.

All the inconsistent findings reported above might have been affected by the general low proficiency of the students under study and further research using a more representative sample size is needed.

Regarding the gap between active and passive vocabulary knowledge, evidence seems to indicate that the size of the gap may not be related to the L2 proficiency of the students. Also, the ratio of these two types of vocabulary knowledge is far from constant. While one of the groups was able to recall as many as $80 \%$ of the words they recognized, one of them could only recall about $50 \%$ . These findings suggest that it may be inappropriate to make the generalization that 'L2 students in general can recall $X \%$ of the words they recognize.' The point is, with such big variations among the 9 groups of students, it can be predicted that this gap will be more varied with regard to individual students. Further research may adopt case study design, not only looking at the gap but the cause for such a gap.

In addition to depicting the gap between active and passive vocabulary knowledge of L2 learners, this study has, more importantly, identified seven strategies which are positively related to active vocabulary knowledge. Findings suggest that to narrow the gap between their active and passive vocabulary knowledge, it is important for students to take the initiative to acquire vocabulary both inside and outside school. Looking up dictionaries for the meaning of words is as important as guessing their meanings from context. The conscious way of learning, such as grouping words together to commit them to memory and repeatedly saying the words, are as effective as learning words subconsciously through playing games. In fact, when it comes to the actual use of vocabulary, students need to know precisely what the words mean and to have them readily available in their memory, though the situations which trigger the use of vocabulary are equally essential. Moreover, results of the questionnaire show that students do not often use these strategies although they consider them useful. These findings have practical implications for the teaching of vocabulary.

As regard the students who are low in English proficiency and poor in vocabulary knowledge such as the students under study, there may be the need for EAP teachers to focus on improving their passive vocabulary (general and academic) before helping them put this vocabulary into productive use. This does not mean to encourage a dichotomous approach to the two types of vocabulary. Rather, this may be the best way to take care of the actual needs of this category of students who are badly in lack of a large passive vocabulary to begin their study in the university. The focus on the learning of passive vocabulary will make it possible for them to know a relatively large number of words within a short period of time.

To conclude, although this is a small-scale study and the students under study were rather weak in proficiency, it has revealed that the gap between active and passive vocabulary is more complicated than it appears to be and more questions seem to have arisen than they are answered. The strategies which have been identified to correlate positively with active vocabulary are particularly useful for the teaching and learning of vocabulary, where the aim is to use the known words in production.
