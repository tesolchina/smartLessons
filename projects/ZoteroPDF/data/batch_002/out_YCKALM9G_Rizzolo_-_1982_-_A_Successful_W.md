# A Successful Writing Program

# Peer Tutors Make Good Teachers

PATRICIA RIZZOLO

s higher education has become accessible to more people, both in perception and in reality, a different kind of student has entered college in numbers not seen before (8:10-11).

Unlike their traditionally prepared and academically screened predecessors, these new students were underprepared, often severely so, in one or more of the basic skills necessary for successful college performance (4:6-7). Faced with providing these students with a means of acquiring the skills that they lacked, faculty members and administrators alike sought a solution in the establishment or expansion of basic skills programs.

Some institutions, like the City University of New York-which spends an estimated $\$ 535$ million a year on remediation'' (11:262)--developed elaborate, wellstaffed programs. Other institutions, and by all indications the majority, opted for more limited, less expensive programs (8:61). The Ogontz Campus of the Pennsylvania State University falls into the latter category.

# The Ogontz Writing Center

The two-year branch Campus's most extensive effort at providing a basic skills program is in the area of written communication. The Campus focused on writing because, despite two significant drops in the cutoff score of the English Placement Test, approximately 25 percent of 1100 incoming freshman place in the deficient skills category and approximately 15 percent place in the borderline skills category. A strong demand by the general faculty to do something about student writing skills or, more precisely, the lack thereof coincided with this phenomenon.

Thus, in addition to offering a three-credit basic skills writing course in grammar, punctuation, and paragraph construction-required of students in the skills deficient group and strongly recommended to those in the borderline group-the Ogontz Campus established a Writing Center. A full-time member of the English Department directs the Center as one-half of her assigned workload. Every full- and part-time member of the English faculty is required to staff the Center one hour and fifteen minutes per week each term. To date, the Center employs no paraprofessional or clerical assistants. Thus, to keep it adequately staffed seven hours a day five days a week and four hours a night two nights a week, it is essential to employ peer tutors.

# The Peer Tutor Program

Peer tutors are an integral part of the Ogontz Writing program. They enable the Writing Center to meet, at least to some degree, the increasingly diversified needs of both students and faculty, while working within the constraints of a small budget. Because of the limited budget, the recruitment, training, and evaluation of peer tutors are solely the province of the Center director. The need to perform these functions in the most efficient manner possible is extremely important in a twoyear college like Ogontz, where, at the end of each academic year, all senior peer tutors transfer to another campus or college.

# Recruitment

Recruitment for the coming academic year begins at the outset of the spring term of the current academic year. This ensures that most of the prospective peer tutors have completed two composition courses. The

Center director then must find qualified tutors in a relatively short time frame. To do so, she turns to the English faculty, all of whom teach different levels of composition throughout the year. As names are submitted, usually fifteen to twenty, the director discusses the strengths and weaknesses of each student with the recommending teacher in an attempt to rank the prospective tutors. Ranking is very helpful in a situation where time and staff are at a premium, for it means that

Sensitivity to student problems is another major area evaluated during the screening interview. In this area, the director looks for both verbal and non-verbal indicators of empathy for tutee problems and concerns. Valuable indicators are the student's description of his own writing experiences, his behavior in the simulated tutoring session, and his view of students with writing problems. However, the student's tone of voice and the facial expressions and body movements that accompany

the director need not interview all the recommended students, if the top-rated ones meet Center criteria.

The director then sets up a screening interview with those who express interest in becoming a peer tutor. Each prospective tutor is asked to bring three or four papers from previous composition courses with him. The screening interview has two main objectives: to determine if the student has the necessary attributes to be an effective peer tutor and to familiarize him with tutor duties and the center operation.

The main attributes that the director looks for are "knowledge of the subject, ability to explain and communicate this knowledge to the tutee, and sensitivity to students' problems'' (8:71). In the process of discussing the student's courses and goals, she elicits his or her attitude toward writing, in general, and his work in composition courses, in particular. During this discussion, the director has the student analyze the strengths and weaknesses of his own writing samples. Though the samples have already been evaluated, the student's analysis can provide valuable information regarding his knowledge of writing and his clarity of expression. For this same purpose, the director simulates a tutoring session in which she plays the role of a tutee with some typical writing problems and the student plays the role of a peer tutor. The director is much more concerned about unclear or inaccurate expression than a few gaps in knowledge. The latter can usually be quickly remedied with study. The former rarely can. At the Ogontz Center, vocabulary knowledge, shown by research to be \*highly correlated with general reading comprehension' (2:6), in practice has proven to be a strong index of a peer tutor's ability to comment critically and constructively on a tutee's written work.

his words and silences are often just as revealing.

Students who took the basic writing skills course and were tutored regularly in the Center usually exhibit a keen awareness of the tutee's situation. When this insight is coupled with competence in subject matter and communication skills, the result is an effective peer tutor. This advocacy does not imply that the former basic skills student is to be preferred for the highpowered student with A's in all his composition courses. The goal is to employ both kinds of students, for each complements the other. The A-student who often lacks a full understanding of tutee problems develops more sensitivity through working with fellow tutors who have overcome some of those very problems. Similarly, the former basic skills student, already empathetic, develops a surer grasp of the subject matter by working with tutors who are confident, knowledgeable writers. While the selection of new peer tutors is never foolproof, no matter how accurate the observed and intuited data, a buffer against egregious error lies in the ongoing training and evaluation required of each senior tutor. Even so, when restricted to a pool of young, inexperienced freshmen, selection sometimes can be a gamble.

The screening interview concludes with an overview of the tutor's duties and salary and the Center operation. One duty which begins during the Spring term is participation in a three-week, four-hours a week internship. Almost without exception students are very willing to participate; they see their time well spent in learning how to tutor first-hand. The students are not paid for the internship. However, once they are officially assigned to the Center, they receive the minimum wage for each hour spent on duty, not for each hour of actual tutoring. This arrangement seems most equitable, given the Center's service system. Currently, it has only a drop-in and referral service. As a result, the Center sometimes abounds with students in need of tutorial help, while at other times it is filled only with students studying and working on projects. In the latter instance, a peer tutor on duty would be paid for her time. Not to pay her would be unfair and a deterrent to recruitment. A clear benefit of this salary schedule is that it makes the required ongoing training and evaluation very palatable to the students and encourages tutors to put in extra, unsalaried hours working with tutees and on Center upkeep.

At the end of the interview, the director schedules a three-week internship with any student who appears to be an excellent prospect for peer tutoring. Those not so designated are placed on a reserve list and tactfully told what area they need to improve. The list is not a maneuver to avoid out-and-out rejection; it is a necessary part of the recruitment procedure. Depending on the hard and soft money available, the director employs from four to eight tutors a term three terms a year. Although there is normally little turnover during the year, occasionally a peer tutor will transfer to another school in mid-year or will not be able to tutor for a variety of reasons. In this situation, the reserve list offers a ready supply of possible substitutes, temporary or long-term.

# Tutor Training

Once the new peer tutors have been recruited, the director assigns each one to a senior tutor for a threeweek internship in which the new tutor learns the Center recordkeeping system, reviews textbooks and other software, and sits in on actual tutoring sessions. Feedback from former tutors indicates that the internship, especially the direct observation, is invaluable to developing know-how and self-confidence. To foster this outcome, the director carefully monitors the observation sessions to make sure that the senior tutor encourages the new tutor to participate in the tutoring process and that he sets aside time to discuss the session with the new tutor. In addition, she schedules time at the end of the internship period to meet with the new tutors as a group to review the Center's philosophical framework and the tutor's place in it. Three major points are explored in this meeting:

. The Center was established to provide individual instruction and positive reinforcement for any Ogontz student seeking help with writing.   
The Center's goal is to help students at any writing level improve their skills, not merely to provide remedial instruction.   
: Center instructors are learning facilitators, not proofreaders.

Individual instruction not only is an ideal learning mode, it also is very conducive to helping to build positive self-concepts in tutees. Many of the underprepared students who attend the Center strongly doubt their academic worth and have the low grades to substantiate their view. These students in particular need realistic encouragement as much as academic instruction. In their unique position of being a contemporary who also is a willing source of advice and information, but not official evaluation, peer tutors can be very influential. As role models, they can "communicate positive and realistic expectations"' (10:30) in an attempt to build a better "sense of belonging, competence, and worth'' (5:41). The concern for the affective side of individual instruction, of course, is not limited to any specific type of student. All students need some degree of positive reinforcement, no matter how self-assured they may appear.

In keeping with its intent to serve the entire student body, the Center stresses general skill improvement. Such a policy motivates faculty members in departments other than English to refer students with a wide range of writing skills. It also motivates competent writers with very specific writing concerns to seek Center assistance. The emphasis on the psychologically positive concept of realistic improvement rather than on the more restrictive and suspect one of remediation attracts a solid cross-section of the student body to the Center. As a result, peer tutors must be prepared to deal with a broad spectrum of writing abilities and concerns, a spectrum bounded at one end by the kind of problems manifested in Shaughnessy's basic writing student (9) and at the other end by the kind manifested in Baker's rhetorical writer (1).

Some peer tutors express doubt as to whether or not they possess the expertise to handle such disparate concerns. Sometimes the doubt is well founded, for the tutors have little or no experience in analyzing writing problems or in formulating corrective measures. Reassurance comes with the knowledge that they are not expected to know everything, that, in fact, they are expected to work closely with the English faculty and each other, when dealing with difficult problems. It also reassures them to know that they have the summer months to review punctuation and grammar and rhetorical patterns and strategies, before they start tutoring in the Center.

One of the most difficult challenges that a new tutor will encounter is that of functioning as a learning facilitator and not a proofreader. Despite the internship and the overview meeting in which active tutee involvement in the instructional process was stressed, tutors at the start of their service tend to want to do all the work, and they want to do it in the context of a private lecture. They almost instinctively fall into the familiar pattern of active teacher-passive student, a pattern rooted in the "sponge method' of learning: listen and soak up (3:2). However, training sessions on methods of facilitation coupled with the realization that proofreading does not lead to genuine learning so much as to exploitation quickly convince the tutors to engage the tutee more directly.

By the fifth week of the fall term, most tutors have developed a versatile blend of questions, explanations, and constructive criticisms and know how to deal with a by the older, more inner-directed student, often respond by abandoning the role of tutor for that of "answer machine' (8:75). As a result, at least one training session will focus on demonstrating and practicing how to maintain the role of facilitator with adult students.

Another topic of increasing interest is writing across the curriculum. A number of times during the year, non-English faculty members request the director to give in-class presentations on essay or report writing to

student who wants to know if his paper is "OK."' Despite the Center's well publicized no proofreading policy, many students, especially those in basic skill composition classes, ask for a global analysis. Rather than refuse to look at the paper, as suggested by departmental purists, the tutor, in a friendly manner, will agree to read the paper, once the tutee has provided certain necessary information. What follows is a series of questions geared to engage the tutee in analyzing his own work:

. What was your specific assignment? . How did you go about doing it? . What is your main idea (thesis statement)? . Can you underline it in the paper? . What ideas did you use to develop the main idea? . Can you bracket them? . Can you point out important details?

In answering these and additional questions, the tutee is editing his paper. To facilitate the process, the tutor explains and criticizes, when he thinks that it is instructive to do so.

With the conclusion of the overview meeting, the new peer tutors do not officially meet the director until the start of the coming academic year. At this time, the director arranges a bi-weekly training meeting with the group. During these one-hour sessions, a variety of cognitive and affective topics related to the tutorial experience are investigated. Discussion, lecture, and roleplay are all employed at one time or another to help explore key concerns. For example, a recent subject of interest has been how to tutor adult students. Adults seeking tutorial assistance generally possess a "problemcentered orientation to learning" and a desire for "immediacy of application" (6:58). Peer tutors, intimidated their history or philosophy or political science students. The director asks peer tutors who are themselves interested in doing these presentations to sit in and observe. Once they have observed a presentation and examined the "different systems for looking at and organizing experience"' (7:5) in training sessions, the director publicizes their availability to do in-class presentations. The results to date have been very positive. Faculty members say that they and their students learn from the experience. The tutors invariably grow more poised and self-confident.

# Tutor Evaluation

Because the peer tutors are continually learning on the job, ongoing, informal evaluation has proven to be a successful method of reinforcing effective performance. Rather than scheduling official conferences, the director informally talks with each tutor about his performance, during the course of the week. Sometimes no more than a few sentences are exchanged; at other times the discussion may last a half an hour. In any case, the give-and-take is such that tutors feel free to criticize any aspect of the Center program and make suggestions for improvement. This approach greatly reduces the anxiety inherent in evaluation, while underscoring a clear set of professional standards and expectations. While informality is the rule, the director will schedule a special conference with a tutor having difficulty doing his job well.

Faculty members and tutees also supply evaluative feedback which the director conveys to the tutors. Much of the professional feedback is the result of the director talking in person or on the telephone with involved faculty, regarding tutor performance. She also talks with tutees in the Center and each term asks regular tutees to fill out a short survey in which they evaluate their specific tutors in terms of such considerations as learning atmosphere created and the degree of helpfulness and learning experienced. Overall, the tutors are rated highly by the faculty and the tutees.

At Ogontz, then, a strong peer tutor program has made a substantial contribution to the continuing success of the campus-wide writing program. The peer tutors have helped to cultivate a genuine concern for sound writing among a sizeable portion of the student body through their consistently professional demeanor and their deep commitment to effective tutoring. Thus, while the peer tutor program is not the complete answer to the question of how to meet the diverse writing needs of a large number of students, it has proved to be an effective one.
