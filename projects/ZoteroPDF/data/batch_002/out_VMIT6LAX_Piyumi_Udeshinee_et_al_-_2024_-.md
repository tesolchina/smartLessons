# ABSTRACT

The discussion on the dynamic assessment (DA) - a combination of assessment and instruction - and regulatory scales from implicit to explicit corrective feedback (CF) is relatively new in the CALL context. Applying the notions of Sociocultural Theory, Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) and Mediation, the present study examines how a DA-based regulatory scale from implicit to explicit CF could be designed to promote language learning in the text chat environment. This was done in collaboration with teachers. Four English-as-a-second-language (ESL) teachers and eight ESL students participated in the study. Using the methodology of design-based research (DBR), the study was conducted mainly in three stages: exploratory stage, first intervention, and second intervention. This study drew on various data. Naturally occurring interaction data such as teachers’ oral conversation transcripts and text chat transcripts were analysed using conversation analysis, while the teachers’ interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Thus, employing DBR, the present study introduces a three-step regulatory scale that could promote learning in the text chat environment. The findings suggest that the three-step regulatory scale could be used by teachers to identify the learner’s potential and assist them in partial or complete self-regulation. The study will introduce a DA-based regulatory scale to promote language learning in the text chat environment and contribute to the knowledge of DA, ZPD and mediation in the CALL context.

# 1.  Introduction

Synchronous online text chat is a tool that has been discussed and explored in CALL (Computer-Assisted Language Learning) research for at least two decades. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that the synchronous text chat promotes learners’ noticing of their language errors (Andujar & Salaberri-Ramiro, 2021; Darhower, 2014; Giguère & Parks, 2018; Henderson, 2021; Lai & Zhao, 2006; Lee, 2008; Sauro, 2009; Sotillo, 2005; Tudini, 2003). It is also considered a tool for emotional scaffolding (Yoshida, 2020). Its interactive and textual nature helps the learner see the language on the screen, unlike in oral conversations where utterances disappear instantly (Lai & Zhao, 2006). Further, text chat is considered a conducive environment for dynamic assessment (DA) (Darhower, 2014), one of the focal discussion points in this study, which will be discussed in detail later. Text chat could also be used in the formal ESL setting as it is available on the Zoom platform, a video conferencing tool used worldwide for educational purposes.

According to Sociocultural Theory (SCT), to assist learners towards learning, the teacher (expert) must consider the distance between the actual and potential level of competence of the learner, which is called the zone of proximal development (ZPD) (Vygotsky, 1978). This potential level of competence could be assessed through learners’ mediation in the form of their prompts, hints and questions during the dialogic interaction with the teacher (Lantolf & Poehner, 2004). However, this dialogic interaction between teachers and learners which is crucial for language learning has been limited to the classroom’s live interactions, thereby deterring continuous support from the teacher due to time and place constraints (Andujar, 2020). As a solution for this, mediational tools such as text chat could be suggested to take this interaction beyond the classroom (Cavus & Ibrahim, 2009; Moghari & Marandi, 2017) while maintaining education’s formality through a tool like Zoom. These mediational tools can impact the assessment, assistance and reception of assistance (Storch, 2018). Thus, text chat could help teachers consider the learners’ ZPD and simultaneously assess and assist them through corrective feedback (CF).

It has been proposed that the teachers’ CF must be graduated and contingent (Ai, 2017; Aljaafreh & Lantolf, 1994; Andujar, 2020). CF should be graduated from implicit to explicit and used only when the learner does not show an ability to work independently (Aljaafreh & Lantolf, 1994). Otherwise, too much assistance could be detrimental as it could jeopardise the learner’s confidence (Aljaafreh & Lantolf, 1994; Storch, 2018). Thus, assistance has to be dynamic. Graduation and contingency are two main characteristics of DA, a concept rooted in Vygotskian writings on ZPD. DA refers to ‘the interaction between an examiner-as-intervener and a learner-as-active participant which seeks to estimate the degree of modifiability of the learner and the means by which positive changes in cognitive functioning can be induced and maintained’ (Lidz, 1987, p.4). The degree of modifiability could be estimated only by an expert during an interaction with the learner, and the positive changes in the learner’s learning process could also be made by an expert in the form of instructions. As Vygotsky (1978) claimed, mediation must be attuned to the learner’s evolving linguistic needs for them to perform beyond their current level of competence. Thus, DA dialogically connects the assessment and instruction as one task (Ai, 2017; Lantolf & Poehner, 2004; Poehner & Lantolf, 2013).

Only a few studies so far have applied ZPD to investigate CF on learners’ writing (Storch, 2018). In the CALL context, even fewer studies have applied ZPD and DA to examine learning through a text chat platform (e.g. Andujar, 2020a; Oskoz). Moreover, there is a dearth of research on how a regulatory scale from implicit to explicit CF could be designed to promote language learning in the text chat mediated environment. We believe that it is important to collaborate with teachers to design such a scale to capture the particular conditions and requirements of the sociocultural contexts through teachers’ experience and knowledge. Thus, informed by SCT, the present study attempts to bridge this research gap by introducing a DA-based regulatory scale that might be feasible to be used to promote learning in the text chat environment. The following sections will discuss the theoretical justifications to the significance of examining the subject in question and explain how the present study is situated in the current literature. Then a description of methods and findings will be presented. Finally, there will be a detailed discussion on findings with implications for future research.

# 2.  Literature review

# 2.1.  Theoretical framework

This research is informed by Sociocultural Theory, which is rooted in the Vygotskian argument that learning is not independent but mediated and cannot be separated from the context in which it is carried out (Wertsch, 1991). SCT, which situates human mentality in a larger cultural and historical context (Marginson & Anh, 2017), has widely been used in the second language (L2) learning research. According to Storch (2018, p. 263), SCT is best suited for investigations on feedback as this theory has ‘considerable explanatory power.’ In particular, we employ the notions of ZPD and mediation to analyse how a regulatory scale from implicit to explicit could be used in a dialogic interaction between an expert (teacher) and a less capable person (learner) in a text chat platform.

Mediation, which is defined as the involvement of a third factor in the interaction between two objects, events or persons (Kozulin, 2018), can be considered the central construct of SCT (Lantolf et  al., 2015; Lantolf & Thorne, 2006). As Vygotsky explains, learning could be mediated by either a physical tool, a system of symbols or the behaviour of a human being in social interaction (Donato & MacCormick, 1994; Lantolf et  al., 2015). In this manner, text chat and regulatory scale, as tools, could mediate the interaction between teachers and learners to help them work collaboratively to promote learning. Vygotsky (1978) argued that mediation in problem-solving should be based on the potential of development rather than actual development. Thus, mediation should lead to the development and help the learner explore new formations. According to Holzman (2018), ZPD is not a zone or a distance but an activity collaboratively created by people. This activity should be dialogic, and the help offered must be graduated and contingent (Aljaafreh & Lantolf, 1994).

The notion of ZPD in Vygotskian Sociocultural theory provides theoretical underpinnings of DA. The term DA, which is considered as the pedagogical instantiation of ZPD (Lantolf, 2009), was coined by Luria, one of the colleagues of Vygotsky. Though DA had earlier been used for research on children with learning difficulties, its application has later expanded to second language pedagogy (Lantolf, 2009). In language pedagogy, two approaches to DA have developed: interventionist DA and interactionist DA. In interventionist DA, a pre-determined fixed set of prompts from implicit to explicit are used to assist learners when they encounter difficulties in producing the accurate target language. The advantage of this approach is that this could be used with a considerably large number of students through computers as the prompts are not individualised. On the contrary, in interactionist DA, the assistance is offered considering learners’ psychological processes and dynamics of their qualitative development.(Lantolf, 2009). The present study uses a pre-determined scale due to several reasons: (1) it might be less demanding on the teacher, (2) it could be used to cater to larger classes (Lantolf, 2009)and (3) it could be more effective in supporting learning than when providing feedback non-systematically (Nassaji & Swain, 2000). However, the approach used in the present study also shares features of the interactionist approach, since teachers are engaged to assess the learners’ linguistic needs and to provide assistance accordingly. Thus, the approach used in the present study could be assumed as a blend of both interventionist and interactionist approaches.

It has also been suggested that DA could be used in interactions with groups by shifting the focus from individuals to groups; by using tasks that cannot be completed by individuals but groups (Poehner, 2009).

However, DA has not been extensively discussed in CALL research. Thus, the present study could contribute to the theoretical and pedagogical discussions on DA in the CALL context.

# 2.2.  Previous studies

It has been claimed that both implicit and explicit CF are helpful for language development, and the choice between implicit and explicit must be made based on the responses of the learner (Ai, 2017; Aljaafreh & Lantolf, 1994; Poehner et  al., 2015; Poehner & Lantolf, 2013). However, a regulatory scale from implicit to explicit was first used in Aljaafreh and Lantolf (1994). Using a 13-step regulatory scale from implicit to explicit, they showed that it could promote learning in a dialogically and collaboratively formed ZPD. However, it must be noted that this scale was designed for oral feedback. Aljaafreh and Lantolf (1994) identified three stages (need for intervention, noticing of the error, and correction of the error) and three forms of regulation (other regulation, partial self-regulation and complete self-regulation). The other regulation occurs when an intervention is needed for the learner to notice or correct the error. Partial self-regulation is when the learner notices and corrects the error with minimal or no intervention. Complete self-regulation is when the learner uses the target language accurately. Later, such scales were tried in the CALL context, too. Many of those studies investigated how the computerised DA (C-DA) could help improve learners’ language (e.g.: Barabadi et  al., 2018; Ebadi et  al., 2018; Jeon, 2021; Kamrood et  al., 2021; Poehner et  al., 2015; Poehner & Lantolf, 2013; Wang et  al., 2021; Yang & Qian, 2020). These C-DA studies focused on how DA could be catered to a large number of students at the same time. Wang et  al. (2021) showed even low English achievers could benefit from C-DA. Barabadi et  al. (2018)examined how both interactionist and interventionist approaches to DA could be used to improve learners’ listening comprehension; therefore, the study used both a computerised programme and a teacher to assist learners. However, the focus of many such C-DA studies was on either reading or listening comprehension (e.g. Kamrood et  al., 2021; Poehner et  al., 2015; Poehner & Lantolf, 2013; Yang & Qian, 2020), while some focused on the enhancement of vocabulary (e.g. Ebadi et  al., 2018; Jeon, 2021). Vakili and Ebadi (2019) used Google Docs as the tool for mediation to provide DA to learners’ academic writing. Darhower (2014) and Andujar (2020) employed the text chat platform as the tool for mediation, and the former used a six-step scale while the latter used a seven-step scale to provide feedback. Although these studies added evidence to the potential of DA in fostering the language abilities of learners, none of the studies have considered teachers’ experience or opinions when designing or evaluating those regulatory scales, nor have they focused on the feasibility of the use of scale. Andujar (2020) suggests the need for further studies to investigate the feasibility of employing peers and native speakers of the target language to provide DA due to time investment issues of teachers.

However, the role played by teachers in the dynamic assessment process should not be underestimated. Employing teachers to provide prompts in the classroom is challenging if the scale has too many prompts, as in the scale introduced by Aljaafreh and Lantolf (1994), especially when the learner’s writing is concerned. The time that could be used for the tasks is limited, and if such a long series of prompts is used, teachers will find it challenging to cater to a larger number of students. Thus, it is important to re-design a regulatory scale that could be feasible to be used in the formal text chat mediated learning environment while addressing practical issues such as time and number constraints.

A review of the previous studies indicates two main aspects: 1). There is a need for more research on the application of DA, 2). There is a dearth of research to examine how a DA-based regulatory scale could be designed for the text chat environment to be used by a teacher. Further, according to Loncar et  al. (2021), more studies should discuss the use of multimodal video conferencing tools such as Zoom for language learning. Therefore, taking a sociocultural approach, this study attempts to answer the following research question:

How could a DA-based regulatory scale be designed to promote language learning in a text chat environment?

This study was conducted in the Sri Lankan context, where teachers seem to be looking for a new feedback strategy, for their feedback is not often well noticed (Udeshinee et al., 2021). Thus, this study is conducted in collaboration with teachers to obtain their pedagogical experiences and perspectives in re-designing a scale. Since we aimed to re-design a regulatory scale appropriate for the text chat environment to be used by teachers, collaboration with teachers was important. Thus, this paper focuses on the teachers’ use of the scale; further studies will be conducted to investigate learner development and the implementation of the scale in a larger class.

# 3.  Methodology

The present study used a design-based research (DBR) methodology to design a DA-based regulatory scale for the text chat environment. The DBR involves a real educational context, intervention, multiple iterations, collaborative partnership between researchers and practitioners, adoption of practical designs, and its impact on both practice and theory (Anderson & Shattuck, 2012). This study is exceptional for it involves only qualitative methodology, whereas most of the DBR based studies use mixed methods (e.g: Liu et  al., 2011; Wood & Bilsborow, 2015). A positivistic approach would not help achieve the purpose of this study, for even the minute details of the learning-leading-development process should be explored. Therefore, this phenomenon which cannot be separated from the sociocultural context, was examined using an interpretative approach.

The present study was set out in a real educational interaction between teachers and learners. First, the teachers’ usual feedback strategies were explored. Then, the regulatory scale, introduced by Aljaafreh and Lantolf (1994), was adapted and used in the first intervention. Based on the analysis of data collected from the first intervention, the scale was re-designed. The re-designed scale was employed in the second intervention; data was collected and analysed (Figure 1).

# 3.1.  Participants and the context

The study employed four university teachers (Table 1) and eight undergraduates (Table 2) on a voluntary basis with informed consent. They were from a university located in the Colombo district, Sri Lanka. Learners were following a certificate course in English offered by the university that is mandatory for the students who had not obtained an $\mathrm { ^ { \circ } S }$ pass $( 4 0 \% )$ for the $\mathrm { A } / \mathrm { L }$ examination (which all the students of Grade 13- national curriculum- have to complete). These results were considered for selection for the course since students usually join the university soon after completing this examination.

# 3.2.  The synchronous text chat environment: Zoom

Zoom (https://zoom.us/), a synchronous, multimodal video conferencing tool popular in the formal educational context, was selected. It has already been suggested as a useful (Kohnke & Moorhouse, 2022; Lenkaitis, 2020) and easy-to-use tool (Kohnke & Moorhouse, 2022) to promote language learning in interactive online classrooms. The Zoom corporate version of the university of the first three authors was used. Participants were familiar with Zoom as they use it for teaching/ learning to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. What is special about Zoom is that apart from the video conferencing and chat functions in the video conferencing platform, Zoom has a separate chat platform (Figure 2), which also acts as a mobile-supported chat app. This can function alone outside the meeting platform. Thus, many features of Zoom were beneficial for the study: text chat, meetings, the possibility of simultaneous engagement in a chat group (using the separate chat function shown in Figure 2) and a meeting (using the video conferencing function) with different participants, the possibility of creating several chat groups, recording meetings, accessing the history of chat, accessing past recordings, spelling correction, emoticons, and tagging.

# 3.3.  The study design

The study was conducted in three stages: the exploratory stage, first intervention, and second intervention (Figure 3). In every stage, one teacher pair communicated with two pairs of learners at two different times (Appendix 1). Thus, twelve sessions were conducted in all stages.

![](img/41ee5ac3f5693ba4353bb45bdd8a3c96c0751d9f4c493325f30594634effd806.jpg)  
Figure 3. T he research process.

Four participants (two teachers and two learners) were involved in one session, and a language activity was used for interaction. Before the interaction started, the first author had an introductory session with all four participants and gave them the required instructions. Then, teachers formed a separate Zoom meeting, and learners remained in the same meeting created by the first author because the learners did not have a Zoom account to initiate meetings. These separate meetings helped them discuss with each other while they communicated through the chat channel created by the researchers. Thus, the interaction between teachers and learners took place in Zoom chat, as indicated in Figure 4.

Figure 4. I nteraction between teachers and learners in one session.

# 3.3.1.  Exploratory stage

The objective of the exploratory stage was to examine teachers’ usual CF strategies; therefore, no prior instruction was given on CF. Four groups were involved in four different activity-based interactions through Zoom chat (see Table 3). Four different activities (adapted from Lee, 2008; Swain & Lapkin, 2001; Yilmaz & Granena, 2010) were used to select an activity appropriate for the text chat environment to be used in the following stages of the study. In each interaction, learners collaboratively completed an activity. Teachers used a CF of their choice to assist learners. After each session, teachers sent their written reflections to researchers.

All teachers provided the correct form of the erroneous sentence (direct CF) without assisting learners to reach independent performance. Teachers seemed to consider the cognitive state of the learner; they assumed that metalinguistic information on the error would overly complicate the learner, and correcting every error would discourage them. However, in most cases, learners did not respond to the CF they received, nor did they seem to pay attention to the CF given.

According to Sociocultural theory, human cognitive functions emerge through interaction. They first emerge in intermental planes through collaboration with others; then, they are internalised and transferred from intermental planes to intramental planes, which could result in independent performance (Vygotsky, 1978). This shows the importance of collaboration for independent performance. The positive effects of collaborative feedback were further confirmed by Afshari et  al. (2020), Nassaji (2011) and Nassaji and Swain (2000). The CF used in the exploratory stage did not show much collaboration. Thus, it could be recommended that the strategy of providing CF must be more collaborative.

The different activities used in the four sessions were examined to select the more appropriate activity for the text chat environment. Spot-the- differences-activity produced a list of separate sentences rather than a structured story. An open-ended question could be better in terms of language production; however, in this context, since the students did not have adequate facts and vocabulary, language production was low. The jigsaw activity was challenging for learners since it took time to figure out the order of the pictures. It was observed that the dictogloss activity was better than the other activities since there was no difficulty finding facts and vocabulary since the learners had already heard the story. Further, the activity did not just produce a list of sentences but a collection of interconnected sentences to make a story, leading to more language production.

# 3.3.2.  Iterative Intervention

Design of the first intervention.  A dictogloss activity was chosen for the first intervention by the authors after examining the interactions and teachers’ views in the explorative stage. The activity was adapted from Yilmaz and Granena (2010) (Appendix 2).

At this stage, teachers were required to use a regulatory scale (Figure  5) which was adopted from Aljaafreh and Lantolf (1994)’s regulatory scale from implicit to explicit (Appendix 3) when assisting learners. The original scale, which had 13 levels seemed effective but was used to provide oral feedback. In this context, where text chat is used, we decided to condense it into five levels as typing for 13 times (in case of other regulation), concerning one error, would be too tiring and complicated for teachers. Thus, the scale was decided by the authors after a thorough discussion. A workshop was conducted before the first intervention to train teachers to use this scale.

<html><body><table><tr><td>Step 1</td><td>Repeat the erroneous sentence ([the erroneous sentence] Is there anything wrong in this sentence/clause/phrase?)</td></tr><tr><td>Step 2</td><td>Narrow down the location of the error. [erroneous phrase] Do you see anything wrong here?)</td></tr><tr><td>Step 3</td><td>Indicate the nature of the error (e.g.: There is something wrong in the tense here).</td></tr><tr><td>Step 4</td><td>Provide clues to help the learner to arrive at the correct form e.g., the verb shouldnt be in present tense</td></tr><tr><td>Step 5</td><td>provide the correct form with explanations/examples (It should be, &quot;she went home yesterday&quot;. This happened yesterday, so you need to use the past form of the verb go</td></tr></table></body></html>

Analysis of the first intervention.  Contrary to the findings of the exploratory stage, in the first intervention, the five-step scale helped teachers assist learners in a way that learners could notice their errors. The analysis of the text chat transcripts revealed that the learner’s selfregulation was comparatively better in the five-step stage because partial self-regulation could be noticed.

However, in this stage, learners checked teachers’ feedback only after completing the entire activity as their focus was on completing the task. Consequently, there were times that learners missed the teacher’s feedback, which prevented learners from reaching self-regulation. Moreover, although teachers tried their best to adhere to the guidelines given, there were instances where they failed to use the scale accurately.

Teachers’ lack of linguistic knowledge in some instances was a challenge. They sometimes struggled to find the accurate linguistic term to explain the error. Moreover, teachers stated that providing assistance through the five-step scale was challenging because it had too many steps to follow and was, therefore, time-consuming. They also admitted that the process could get tiresome and frustrating when students fail to notice their errors even after many steps. Thus, their levels of motivation and enthusiasm were low during the first intervention. However, the teachers agreed that regardless of these challenges, the scale would help learners who are willing to correct their errors. Thus, they concluded that the success of this approach heavily depends on the learner’s attitudes and motivation.

Design of the second intervention.  The first intervention was assessed through teachers’ reflections on the practicality and the suitability of the scale and the researchers’ observations of the intervention. Teachers’ reflections were collected through a workshop that followed the first intervention, where the first author and the teachers collaboratively constructed a tentative design for the second intervention. Teachers suggested that the first step, which is to signal learners of an error, is unnecessary because most of the time, they are errors, not mistakes. Further, they suggested that the indication of the nature of the error and the location of the error could be combined, and the step for providing clues be removed.

Afterwards, the scale was revised by the authors at a separate meeting while considering teachers’ views. It was decided that providing clues should remain because it is essential to assist learners through their ZPD, but the number of steps of the scale was reduced to three (Figure  6). Further, it was decided to focus on one type of error as the teachers believed that focusing on several error types would dilute the process, defeating the purpose of tangibly assisting the learners.

This happened yesterday, so you need to use the past form of the verb &quot;go&#x27;)</td></tr></table></body></html>

Before the second intervention, another workshop was conducted to train teachers to use the re-designed scale. Another dictogloss activity adapted from Qin (2008) (Appendix 4) was used in this stage. The activity required the learners to work collaboratively and interact with teachers through Zoom chat, and the teachers had to use the three-step regulatory scale to provide assistance.

# 3.3.3.  Time consumed for the interaction

When examining the interaction in all the stages, it is noteworthy to assess the time consumed by these stages. Table 4 indicates the relevant details, and it should be noted that in each stage, the group combination was the same; for example, the group members of session one of all stages were the same.

Table 4 indicates that in terms of the average time, the second intervention consumed the minimum time of all stages. Session one of the exploratory stage consumed the least time of all sessions; however, noticing of errors and partial or complete self-regulation was very low in this session.

# 3.4.  Data collection

Oral conversations between teachers during the text chat interaction were audio-recorded to better understand their inner speech; to examine how they use the revised scale to assist learners. Exploring their conversations was assumed to give a better understanding of their inner thoughts rather than examining their perspectives in an interview or a think-aloud protocol. At the end of each activity, the teachers’ written reflections on the interaction were also collected. Further, group interviews were conducted with the teachers before and after the first intervention.

Data was collected in all the stages. In the exploratory stage, data was collected through transcripts of the text chat conversations between teachers and learners (4 transcripts), transcripts of oral conversations of teachers during the activity (4 transcripts), teachers’ written reflections on the activity (4 transcripts) and through a semi-structured group interview. The collected data was used to design the first intervention, and data was collected from the first intervention similar to the exploratory stage. Based on the analysis of the data collected from the first intervention, the second intervention was re-designed, and the data was collected similar to the exploratory stage and the first intervention.

# 3.5.  Data analysis

Text chat sessions and teachers’ oral conversations were transcribed using Jefferson transcription conventions (Stivers & Sidnell, 2013) and analysed using conversational analysis (CA) using the guidelines suggested by Ellis and Barkhuizen (2005). CA was selected to analyse data because it helps explore participants’ perspectives on what is happening in the conversation rather than analysing the researcher’s perspective on what is happening in the conversation (Ellis & Barkhuizen, 2005). It is an empirically based approach used to analyse naturally occurring data (Ellis & Barkhuizen, 2005). Teachers’ reflections were analysed using thematic analysis using the guidelines suggested by Braun and Clarke (2006).

# 4.  Findings from the second intervention: the use of the three-step scale

This study examines how a regulatory scale of implicit to explicit could be designed to promote language learning in the text chat environment. The findings will be analysed to answer the research question of the study.

# 4.1.  Da-based three-step regulatory scale from implicit to explicit for the text chat platform

The findings of the second intervention suggest that the three-step regulatory scale could help teachers assist learners in reaching self-regulation. As shown in Figure 7, if the learner’s utterance is erroneous, the teacher must narrow down the location and indicate the nature of the error in the first prompt. If the learner cannot achieve self-regulation, the teacher must provide a clue in the second prompt. If the learner is still unable to reach self-regulation, the teacher has to provide the correct form in the third prompt.

Figure 7. T he three-step regulatory scale for dynamic assessment.

# 4.2.  Partial and complete self-regulation

Most often, learners seem to achieve partial or complete self-regulation with the help of the three-step scale. After a specific error was corrected, they rarely repeated the same. This is indicated in Figures 8 and 9. Figure 8 indicates learners reaching self-regulation through teachers’ assistance, while Figure 9 shows how learners accurately use what they

2 T1 This is correct 4:31 PM Approves

learned in the interaction given in Figure 8. This shows that the three-step regulatory scale leads them towards complete self-regulation.

In line three, teachers indicate the nature and the location of the error. In line four, learners construct a grammatically correct sentence; however, it does not match the rest of the sentence. Therefore, teachers provide clues and guide them towards finding the correct form in lines 5, 6, and 7. Nevertheless, the learners fail to produce the correct utterance (line 8). It seems that learners misunderstand the teacher’s prompt, which asks them to change the first part of the sentence (line 7); they change the second part (line 8). However, both lines 7 and 8 are produced during the same minute; thus, it could be possible that learners did not see teachers’ prompt in line 7 before producing line 8. This also shows learners’ lack of understanding of present and present continuous forms. However, after giving them two minutes to correct the error, since students have failed to respond, teachers provide a clue in line 9. After giving learners another minute, since they do not respond, teachers provide the correct answer in line 10. It is interesting to see how learners reached complete self-regulation on the same linguistic form towards the end of the conversation (Figure 9), indicating that learning occurs in this context.

With the assistance of the three-step scale, learners seem to reach self-regulation sooner than in the previous stages. Moreover, using the editing option available in Zoom, learners sometimes edited their inaccurate answers immediately before teachers responded. This means the scale helped the learners achieve independent performance. The learners were highly engaged, and the learner’s self-regulation seems to be high as well. Further, the conversation was more response-driven, enabling the noticing of errors.

# 4.3.  Teachers’ role in promoting language development

Learners’ prompts helped teachers dynamically assess learners’ ZPD and assist them accordingly. Figure 10 indicates how learners use prompts

1 T1 Can you please recheck the spelling of 3.12 PM Location and nature the word you mentioned as "wormed"   
2 S2 Is it warm. Sorry my issue. 3.15 PM Prompt by the learner   
3 T1 Yes, you got it 3.16 PM   
4 T1 But will keep it in the past tense as you 3.16 PM correctly said, warmed   
5 T1 $\circledcirc$ 3.16 PM   
6 T1 And now we can correct the sentence as, 3.17 PM Confirm the correct The snake was warmed up in the. sentence farmer's clothes and it began to move   
7 S2 Ok miss. I understand 3.18 PM Prompt from the learners

during the interaction where the three-step regulatory scale was used. These prompts not only indicate learners’ noticing and understanding but also their interest and motivation in correcting their language errors.

In this sequence, learners make two prompts: (1) in line 2 as a question and acceptance of the error, which shows their noticing and understanding of the error, and (2) in line 7 as a confirmation of their understanding. Apart from assisting learners to reach the correct target form, teachers seem to play an interesting role in providing emotional support via emojis (line 5). The following extract shows how the teacher understands learners’ potential and assists them accordingly.

Teachers use step 1 to show the spelling error learners made in line 1. However, the prompt given by the learner in line 4 indicates that the error is not a spelling error but a result of them not grasping the meaning of the particular sentence. This reveals that the learners tend to type what they hear without comprehending the meaning. Therefore, teachers provide the correct form rather than dragging the conversation unnecessarily. The prompt in line 7 shows that learners accepted and understood the correction. This learning is further confirmed later by their utterance, ‘I was bitten by you.’ This indicates that the earlier sequence in Figure 11 has helped them reach complete self-regulation. Thus, it seems that the three-step regulatory scale supports teachers in promoting language development.

1 S2 Then, Suddenly the farmer was bitten by 3.21 PM Sentence 8 the snake and worse hurts   
2 T1 Good :) 3.23 PM Location and nature But the last part worse hurts" needs to be changed. Can you redo that part   
3 T1 Check the spelling of the word "worse" 3.23 PM   
4 S2 is it worst 3.26 PM Prompt from the learner   
5 T1 No, it should be was 3.27 PM Provide the correct form So needs fo be corrected as was hurt.   
6 T1 Then, Suddenly the farmer was bitten by 3.28PM the snake and was hurt S2 ok miss 3.28 PM Prompt from the learner

# 4.4.  Teachers’ views on the text chat mediated three-step regulatory scale

Teachers mentioned that the three-step scale was more effective than the five-step scale because it was easier to follow, quicker and more specific as it had only three steps. Moreover, teachers prefered focusing on one type of error. Further, they concurred that both teachers and students were highly engaged in and enjoyed the activities at this stage and that they could also notice an improvement in the students. However, teachers revealed that it would have been better if teachers and students had known each other before the activity since it would have made the learning environment more comfortable for both parties.

# 5.  Discussion

The aim of the study was to examine how a DA-based regulatory scale could be designed for the text chat platform to promote learning. To achieve this objective, the previous literature was examined on such scales; then, the 13-step regulatory scale introduced by Aljaafreh and Lantolf (1994) was adapted and re-designed as suitable for the text chat platform. The use of this re-designed scale was analysed, and based on the analysis, the three-step scale was introduced. Findings showed that teachers found the three-step scale less challenging since there were fewer steps, and the learners seemed to be highly engaged in the activity throughout without giving up in the middle.

Findings of this study corroborate Ai (2017), Aljaafreh and Lantolf (1994), Nassaji and Swain (2000), Poehner and Lantolf (2013), Darhower (2014), Poehner et  al. (2015) and (Andujar, 2020)on the support of DA-based regulatory scales for language development. This study supports Oskoz and Darhower (2014) by suggesting that the DA-based regulatory scale could provide a clear picture of the learners’ development. Findings are also in line with Andujar (2020): learners needed less explicit feedback towards the end of the interaction since they reached partial or complete self-regulation. This indicates the language development of the learners when mediated by the three-step regulatory scale. As Storch (2018) claims, if the learners need less assistance over time, it indicates language development.

Findings are also in line with (Yoshida, 2020) which claims that text chat could be used for emotional scaffolding and Oskoz which suggests that it is possible to observe students’ development in the text chat and assist them contingently. Overall, the three-step scale, in general, facilitated the language correction contributing to the emergence of better scaffolding. Previous research into DA such as Aljaafreh and Lantolf (1994) also argues that teachers should understand the level of competency of learners and should not make the learning process frustrating for the learner. The teacher’s assistance should be aligned with learner needs to enable them to perform beyond their current level of functioning. Further, similar to Lee (2008), this study also suggests that the teachers have to be thoroughly trained on the use of scale and linguistic terms and knowledge.

Notably, some learners attempted to reproduce what they heard without paying attention to its meaning. However, they could gain some learning in the second intervention, which was indicated by their self or partial regulation. Therefore, it is clear that a DA-based regulatory scale would force even the weaker students to notice and correct their errors. Moreover, the study confirms the findings of Afshari et  al. (2020), Nassaji (2011) and Nassaji and Swain (2000) which suggest that the feedback should be collaborative.

Thus, this regulatory scale functions as a cognitive tool for learners to reflect on their language use, notice their errors and self-regulate. It acts as a mediating tool for teachers to access learners’ ZPD. The scale also functions as a social tool for teachers and learners to build a closer relationship with each other which would ultimately help improve learners’ self-confidence.

Baumgartner et al. (2003) suggest four ways that the DBR helps improve educational practice. First, the DBR creates the possibility to explore innovations in the teaching-learning environment. Since this type of research is conducted in real educational settings using real tools and materials, they can promote such innovations. The present study is conducted in the real teacher-learner online interactions using a popular online tool, Zoom. Secondly, DBR contributes to the theories of learning and instruction. The present study contributes to the advancement of educational practices by contributing to learning and instruction theories such as ZPD, DA and mediation. Thirdly, from a design perspective, DBR contributes to the design knowledge. This study suggests the following possible design guidelines concerning online interaction and the use of scale.

Before the interaction:

Teachers and learners should be given an opportunity to know each other (e.g. arrange a social function) and build a positive relationship. Both teachers and learners should be given thorough training on the relevant technical aspects of the Zoom platform. Learners should be taught about the specific grammar component focused on during the activity. Teachers should be given a thorough workshop on the use of the scale, linguistic terms and rules needed for the session. Free time for both teachers and learners should be allocated for the task.

During the interaction:

The interaction must be collaborative where interactants should respond to each other as in a natural conversation (without just producing a list of sentences and feedback). When using the scale, teachers should focus on only one type of error.

Fourth, DBR leads to expanding the human capacity for educational innovation. This study gives an opportunity for the teachers to encounter new theoretical knowledge and acquire experience in new educational settings. Thus, the present study contributes to the development of educational practices by fulfilling the four requirements suggested by Baumgartner et  al. (2003).

# 6.  Conclusion and future research

Thus, the study concludes that the DA-based three-step regulatory scale from implicit to explicit presented in this study would be beneficial in promoting learning in the CALL context. This scale helps the teacher assess the learner’s potential and assist them towards learning. However, this study does not suggest that this activity should replace the classroom activities, but this could be used as one of the activities that could trigger learners’ language development. This task is suggested especially for learners with high anxiety who struggle with the target language, especially in oral conversations. Since text chat is similar to oral conversations, we believe this task would act as an initial point for such learners to start conversing in the target language.

The study sheds some light on the usefulness of a task like the dictogloss activity to be used in the text chat. The dictogloss activity seems to be promising in this online interaction, but it needs further investigation to examine to what extent it could be useful. Further, it would be interesting to investigate the required time duration and the frequency for such a task to be effective. The interaction could be implemented in one-to-one online interaction (1 teacher- 1 student), with student pairs (1 teacher − 2 students) or with student groups (1 teacher – a group of students). However, it may need further investigation. As Storch (2018) suggests, more longitudinal studies should examine how a regulatory scale could promote learning since the language learning process takes time. For future research, it could be recommended to employ more teachers from different language courses because there might be a possibility of obtaining more input and making the scale more feasible. The present study is only an attempt to introduce a regulatory scale suitable for the text chat environment to be used by teachers. However, further research is needed to examine the feasibility of the scale to be used in the actual ESL classroom. This study provides richer insights to the current discussion on using DA-based regulatory scales in the CALL context while contributing to the knowledge of ZPD and mediation in computer-mediated L2 learning. The study may also provide a guiding light for future researchers to develop study designs and learning interventions.

# Appendix 2: Dictogloss activity

One bright sunny morning, mother makes some jam. When she puts the jam bottle up on top of the cupboard, the child is watching, and he is pretty curious. Mother gets ready to go to the store, and the child asks, ‘Where are you going?’ She says, ‘I am going to the post office.’ The child waits until his mother is gone and checks to see what his father is doing. His father is reading a newspaper. He looks at the jar, but he is not tall enough to reach there. He takes the chair and puts it by the cupboard, and he gets a stool, and he puts it on top of the chair. And he dangerously climbs on top of the chair and the stool to reach the jam. But before he can reach the jam, he falls down. He starts crying; his father comes in and asks, ‘What are you doing here?’

# Appendix 3: Regulatory scale - implicit to explicit, introduced by Aljaafreh and Lantolf (1994)

1. Tutor asks the learner to read, find the errors, and correct them independently, prior to the tutorial.   
2. Construction of a ‘collaborative frame’ prompted by the presence of the tutor as a potential dialogic partner.   
3. Prompted or focused reading of the sentence that contains the error by the learner or the tutor.   
4. Tutor indicates that something may be wrong in a segment (e.g. sentence, clause, line)-’Is there anything wrong in this sentence?’   
5. Tutor rejects unsuccessful attempts at recognising the error.   
6. Tutor narrows down the location of the error (e.g. tutor repeats or points to the specific segment which contains the error).   
7. Tutor indicates the nature of the error, but does not identify the error (e.g. ‘There is something wrong with the tense marking here’).   
8. Tutor identifies the error (‘You can’t use an auxiliary here’).   
9. Tutor rejects learner’s unsuccessful attempts at correcting the error.   
10. Tutor provides clues to help the learner arrive at the correct form (e.g. ‘It is not really past but something that is still going on’).   
11. Tutor provides the correct form.   
12. Tutor provides some explanation for use of the correct form.   
13. Tutor provides examples of the correct pattern when other forms of help fail to produce an appropriate responsive action

Dictogloss activity

On a cold day in winter, a snake was very hungry. He went out for food. It was snowing. The snake was frozen on a road. At that time, a farmer passed by. The snake was found by the farmer. The snake was picked up by the farmer and then put into the farmer’s clothes. The snake was warmed up and it began to move. The farmer was very happy. Suddenly, the farmer was bitten by the snake and was hurt. The farmer asked the snake, ‘Why did you hurt me?’ The snake said, ‘Well, I was saved by you, but now I am caught by you, too.’ The farmer was very angry and says, ‘I saved you, but I was bitten by you.’ Then the snake said nothing and left the farmer.
