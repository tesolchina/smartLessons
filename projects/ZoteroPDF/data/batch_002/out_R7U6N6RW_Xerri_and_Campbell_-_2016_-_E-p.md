# E-portfolios in teacher development: the better option?

Daniel Xerri and Caroline Campbell

Following the introduction of print portfolios for teacher development in the ELT sector in Malta, this article discusses the findings of a small-scale study that highlighted teachers’ views in relation to the possible future implementation of e-portfolios. It shows that while aware of the benefits of this tool, teachers have concerns about their own digital literacy and the threats to privacy posed by an e-portfolio’s accessibility. The article underscores the idea that teachers need to have ownership of their professional development, by being able to decide for themselves whether they want to switch from the print to the electronic version of the portfolio.

Teacher portfolios have been playing an active role in teacher development for a number of decades (Jones 2010). Acting as a collection of documents that charts professional development over the span of a career, a portfolio’s value for a teacher is that it provides a means by which an individual can reflect on beliefs and practices and seek further development. More than just a record of facts about a teacher’s professional growth, the portfolio ‘represents who you are, what you do, why you do it, where you have been, where you are, where you want to go, and how you plan on getting there’ (Evans 1995: 11). Hence, portfolios help to illustrate how teachers construct their professional identity over time. This makes portfolios invaluable tools for trainers wishing to obtain insights into teachers’ development processes.

In 2012, teacher portfolios were implemented in Malta’s private ELT sector. The teaching population in this sector amounts to more than 1,400 professionals, the majority of whom are employed on a part-time basis. Teacher portfolios were introduced by the EFL Monitoring Board (now known as the ELT Council), a government regulatory body responsible for devising policies that serve to promote high standards in the Maltese ELT sector. Malta was the first country worldwide to regulate its ELT sector. While such quality assurance has the benefit of maintaining high standards in the academic services offered by schools, the downside is that schools are subjected to top-down policy implementation. The ELT Council conducts regular quality assurance visits to schools. By means of these visits it ensures that there exists an effective mechanism to maintain teaching standards, advises schools on how to support teachers in their

continuing professional development (CPD), and assists schools in developing a strong CPD culture.

The introduction of teacher portfolios in the ELT sector in Malta was prompted by the need to facilitate schools’ efforts in promoting professional development amongst teachers. Research has established ‘just how powerful a professional development and personal affirmation process the portfolio can be’ (Dinham and Scott 2003: 243). Jones (ibid.: 603) asserts that ‘a mandatory portfolio may… be the prompt needed for the reflection required to promote professional development’. Her research recognizes ‘the portfolio as a powerful mechanism by which teachers can examine their beliefs and be challenged, informed and confirmed in their practice’ (ibid.). For these reasons, teacher portfolios were introduced as part of a quality assurance policy governing academic school visits. This policy specifies that each portfolio should consist of a number of documents (i.e. CPD attendance certificates, self-evaluation forms, reports on observed lessons, etc.) and every school’s director of studies should use them to support teachers’ professional development. This policy was developed in collaboration with the leading stakeholders in the sector, including teachers, trainers, directors of studies, and school owners. This was done for two separate reasons. Firstly, successful implementation relies on adapting the portfolio to the local context. Secondly, when teachers are involved in a process of consultation about the development and implementation of a portfolio system, then they are much more likely to be persuaded of its benefits (Janssen, Kreijns, Bastiaens, Stijnen, and Vermeulen 2013).

When teacher portfolios were implemented in the ELT sector in Malta the decision was taken to adopt a print version rather than an e-portfolio platform. This was motivated by concerns about the costs and the technical requirements for an e-portfolio system. Possible gaps in teachers’ digital literacy were also taken into consideration. However, these concerns do not discount the possibility that e-portfolios might be adopted in the next few years. With hindsight, some of those responsible for implementing portfolios in Malta have expressed doubts about whether opting for the print version was the right decision. These doubts were prompted by the realization that changing to an e-portfolio platform in the future might be even more costly than adopting it at the outset. Based on interviews with teachers at one particular ELT school, this article explores their views on whether e-portfolios would be the better option.

E-portfolios are nowadays considered one of the mainstays of professional development in a wide variety of ELT contexts (Trent and Shroff 2013). Individual schools as well as entire educational systems considering the implementation of teacher portfolios might find it natural to opt for the electronic version rather than the traditional print format, especially since the latter are much ‘chunkier’ and do not afford the same ease of compilation as provided by e-portfolios. Some of the benefits of an e-portfolio include the possibility that a director of studies or a teacher trainer can provide teachers with rapid feedback. Ayan and Sefero ğlu (2011: 519) found that e-portfolios gave teachers:

a sense of ownership, supported collaboration and allowed them to make connections between theory and practice. With the on-going nature of the e-portfolio, participants had the chance of developing and reviewing their portfolio artefacts whenever and wherever they wanted.

E-portfolios have the potential to be a meaningful and supportive tool that fosters the creation of teachers who are able to bridge theoretical learning and actual classroom practices; analyse and refine such practices; reflect upon what, why, and how to teach; and engage in a variety of activities including the sharing of visions and ideas, observing each other’s classes, or participating in shared decision-making (Kabilan and Khan 2012: 1018). Despite the fact that these advantages could equally apply to print portfolios, they are magnified even further when coupled with the mobility, accessibility, and convenience of e-portfolios. This combination makes e-portfolios highly appealing for any organization with a remit for teacher development.

None the less, the research literature indicates that the implementation of e-portfolios does pose a number of challenges, including the fact that the lack of technical know-how might detract from the benefits of the portfolio as an instrument for teacher development. Opting for the digital version solely because it might seem more attractive than the print version could jeopardize the benefits of the portfolio as a tool for professional development, especially if technical difficulties are not adequately taken into account. In fact, Goldsby and Fazal (2000: 123) maintain that ‘The glitz and glitter of Web pages should not distract from the substance of the portfolio’. E-portfolio implementation ‘needs to include an alignment with previously developed successful portfolio principles and structures’ (Woodward and Nanlohy 2004: 176). Moreover, Pecheone, Pigg, Chung, and Souviney (2005: 174) state:

If the technology is perceived as unable to address a problem, or the technology introduces more problems than it solves, the technology or its implementation must be reassessed.

Trent and Shroff (op.cit.: 18) found that ‘engagement with an e-portfolio may carry risks in terms of identity construction’, especially for those teachers who lack the necessary digital literacy skills and interest to engage with technology. They suggest that:

Steps should be taken to ensure that both in-service as well as preservice teachers have opportunities to develop competencies necessary for engagement with technologies such as e-portfolios and that these competencies are recognized. (ibid.)

Fong, Lee, Chang, Zhang, Ngai, and Lim (2014: 65) explain that ‘Successful implementation is about establishing buy-in. To this end, positive perceptions about digital teaching portfolios have to be cultivated among the target users’. It seems clear that in order for e-portfolios to be introduced successfully, teachers need adequate training aimed at their knowledge and skills in relation to how to use this professional development tool. In turn, this training will also develop their attitudes towards the e-portfolio and its usefulness.

The findings reported in this article form part of a larger study investigating the implementation of print portfolios at an ELT school in Malta. Xerri and Campbell (2015) conduct a full discussion of the contents of these print portfolios, how teachers use them, the significance teachers ascribe to portfolios and their implementation, the contribution portfolios make to development and change, and the challenges teachers face in using them. As part of this study, teachers’ views on e-portfolios were also explored, given that switching to a digital version might be considered the logical next step in the implementation process for both the ELT Council and the schools themselves. The study was of a small-scale nature and acted as a case study by involving the participation of nine teachers employed at an ELT school in Valletta. Typical of qualitative research, the study’s aim was not generalizability. The school was chosen as the focus of this study because one of the authors is employed as its director of studies. The other author was responsible for the national implementation of the teacher portfolio system.

In 2014, the school employed $3 6$ teachers, 12 of them all year round. It had a population of circa 1,200 learners originating from a variety of countries and speaking a wide array of first languages. Table 1 shows that almost all the study participants were experienced teachers who had been at the school for more than one year. This was one of the reasons for which they were asked to voluntarily form part of the study, the other being convenience. Most of them had a European Qualifications Framework (EQF) Level 5 certificate in ELT, which is equivalent to a Cambridge ESOL CELTA or Trinity Certificate in TESOL. The other two teachers held a TEFL Certificate, which is an EQF Level 4 qualification in ELT methodology devised by the ELT Council and delivered and assessed by those language schools accredited to run the course.

A face-to-face semi-structured interview was held with every teacher participating in the study. The purpose of each $3 0$ -minute interview was to probe the beliefs and attitudes of the participant in relation to the implementation of the teacher portfolio system. Despite the fact that the system introduced in Malta was in print format (which teachers were already using at the time of the study), the interviewees were also asked for their views about e-portfolios. They were asked to indicate whether they would be interested in using an e-portfolio and the reasons for which they would or would not consider adopting such a tool. This was deemed important given that the introduction of technology might lead to problems (Pecheone et al. op.cit.), especially if teachers are not properly consulted beforehand. Each interview was audiotaped and subsequently transcribed. The transcribed responses were coded and a number of categories emerged from the data. The most significant ones were:

teachers’ doubts about implementation   
teachers’ perceptions of their own digital literacy the need for training   
the impermanence of e-portfolios   
the availability of content   
security and privacy concerns.

These categories were then organized in terms of two broad issues: digital literacy and accessibility.

One of the most significant issues raised in the interviews concerned the teachers’ digital literacy, i.e. the knowledge and skills required to use a range of digital devices. Those teachers who expressed doubts about the idea of implementing e-portfolios perceived digital literacy as an obstacle. This is in line with Trent and Shroff’s (op.cit.) warning about the potential dangers posed by e-portfolios to teachers’ identity. One teacher affirmed, ‘I’m terrible at technology. I have this irrational fear of anything related to technology’ (Teacher 7, henceforth T7). She went on to describe herself as

the old-fashioned type so for me a print file is more accessible; it’s more real and personal. I like writing things down … I feel I’m more into it than if I had to do it on a computer.

These sentiments were shared by another teacher who claimed she would rather have it on paper simply because technology has its own problems and as a result sometimes your portfolio might not be available … Not everyone knows how to use a computer at the same level so I believe having the option to use a print portfolio should still be available to teachers … It’s more personal and accessible. It’s yours! (T4)

One teacher in particular asserted:

Forget it! No interest whatsoever! I’m fifty years old. I have a full life and I don’t need any more hassle. It’s for the younger generation … I’d rather keep using the print portfolio because I’m still of that age where I don’t like the idea of losing things since you can lose things online. I still like my hard copy. (T1)

A colleague of hers tried to explain the reason for such resistance by saying:

We have a number of mature teachers who aren’t so good at computers … So I think it would be better for them to have the portfolio as it is. An e-portfolio for them might not be so user-friendly. (T8)

These teachers highlighted the need for adequate training in relation to digital literacy prior to the implementation of e-portfolios. Such training would equip teachers with the knowledge and skills needed in order to feel comfortable with the digital alternative to what they are currently

using. Despite the fact that the ELT sector benefits from a range of digital innovations purposely developed for teachers’ needs, it must be borne in mind that some teachers might not be keen on adopting such innovations if they consider their own poor digital literacy to be a handicap. Moreover, training would also need to develop teachers’ attitudes in relation to e-portfolios given that they seem to perceive them negatively due to their lack of familiarity with technology (Fong et al. op.cit.). Such training might enable teachers to arrive at a point where they would consider e-portfolios as providing an equally personalized experience to that offered by the print version.

None the less, irrespective of their level of digital literacy, it must also be acknowledged that teachers should have a say about whether they prefer using a print or electronic version of the portfolio. Engaging teachers in a discussion about such a choice is necessary because ‘a lack of a clear understanding of the purpose and ownership of a portfolio constitutes a serious flaw in the process’ (Imhof and Picard 2009: 153). Janssen et al. (op.cit.: 274) affirm that it is ‘important to be clear about the ownership of the [portfolio] and give teachers the opportunity to decide how they want to use it for their career’. Teachers need to be provided with a sense of ownership over the entire process otherwise they might be unable to see the portfolio as contributing to their professional development (Xerri and Campbell op.cit.). Encouraging teachers to attend training aimed at enhancing their digital literacy only with the purpose of forcing them to adopt an e-portfolio system when they might feel more comfortable with the print version is likely to backfire.

The other significant issue highlighted by the interviews concerned an e-portfolio’s accessibility. This issue is double-edged, given that an e-portfolio presents the advantage of constant access but also the problem of breaches of security and privacy. According to one teacher:

The way the teaching profession is developing is that everything is becoming more and more technologically advanced … so progressing from a paper-based portfolio to an e-portfolio is probably a very good idea. (T5)

She clarified that she does

like to have something concrete and something solid but that doesn’t necessarily mean that all of your observations and all of your profiles have to be on paper. You can always put everything online and print it if you need it. It’s still there. It’s still tangible, only in a different way. (T5)

In line with Ayan and Seferoğlu’s (op.cit.) ideas, another teacher explained that:

In some ways it’s easier because when you’ve got some downtime and you’re sitting on a bus or whatever, you can just flick through it. You’re occupying yourself in this way. You can use this time for your personal benefit … It would be more open. (T6)

This openness, however, made some teachers feel concerned about the security of their portfolio:

I would be interested in using an e-portfolio if the access were secure … Anything on the internet is much more easily accessible but that isn’t necessarily a good thing. (T3)

A colleague of hers pointed out that:

It would be much easier for me to access it but it would also be easier for others to access … It would be good to have it online but having others accessing it makes me a little uneasy. (T2)

This fear made one teacher state, ‘No, I wouldn’t like to use an e-portfolio … I don’t know who will have access to it’ (T9).

Given that a portfolio consists of highly personal reflections about practice and beliefs, these teachers need to be convinced that the implementation of an e-portfolio system would be adequately robust in terms of security. This is probably impossible to achieve given that any online system is susceptible to security and privacy breaches. Hence, teachers’ fears cannot ever be fully allayed. For this reason it is imperative that if teachers are offered the choice of benefiting from e-portfolios they are also made aware of the risks involved. Moreover, given their concerns, it would probably be irresponsible for a school or a regulatory body like the ELT Council to coerce teachers into switching to an e-portfolio system. Once again, the benefits of portfolios for teacher development are most likely to be harnessed if teachers can claim ownership of the tool. If teachers are not allowed to decide whether they want to use e-portfolios rather than the print version, the advantages associated with the former’s accessibility might be well-nigh irrelevant given that it would be unlikely for teachers to use the tool in an effective manner.

The above findings underscore the need for this study to be extended further. Given its small-scale nature, this article is not meant to be representative of teachers’ views in relation to e-portfolios in the ELT sector in Malta and internationally. None the less, the revolutionary changes instigated by the use of technology in ELT means that schools in different international contexts might consider the implementation of e-portfolios as a viable way forward. This is certainly the case with a number of schools in Malta. Hence, the findings discussed in this article might resonate with ELT professionals working in other medium-sized schools in contexts where e-portfolios are deemed to be a prospective form of teacher development.

The interviews conducted in this study confirm the idea that the implementation of an e-portfolio system needs to be accompanied by ample training, where needed. This needs to be delivered by trainers who are themselves users of an e-portfolio. This training should be aimed at a variety of targets. As An and Wilder (2010: 84) point out:

Adopting an e-portfolio requires much more than simply substituting one medium (analog paper) for another (digital bits). Rather, the development process demands new work endeavors … along with new demands for development time and technical competence.

Teachers’ knowledge of how an e-portfolio works and their ability to use it effectively must be one of the trainer’s chief priorities (Trent and Shroff op.cit.). Teachers’ digital literacy must not be taken for granted and their familiarity with the chosen platform might need to be ensured before they are encouraged to start using it for professional development purposes. Their concerns in relation to such a platform’s security might need to be addressed in order for them to feel reassured that by using an e-portfolio they are not dispensing of their right to privacy. Doing one’s utmost to allay their fears might be one of the first steps towards winning them over (Fong et al. op.cit.); however, this needs to be conducted in an honest manner. While it is probably important to encourage teachers to share the contents of their portfolios with their peers, they might also need to be shown that one cannot have complete faith in the system’s ability to safeguard the confidentiality of information one would not want to share. Lastly, training might also need to focus on the added value of an e-portfolio so that teachers’ attitudes toward this tool are adequately developed. The above training would serve to empower teachers to switch to the electronic version if they so choose.

Irrespective of how much training accompanies the implementation of e-portfolios, teachers should always feel that they have the right to opt out; they need to be given the final say. This will probably only happen if those responsible for implementation are aware of the fact that ‘the defining characteristic of a portfolio is that it is owner-centric’ (Garrett 2011: 189). If decisions in relation to teacher development are taken without proper consultation and with a disregard for teachers’ preferences and concerns, then the tool in question is likely to fail to deliver the expected outcomes. Unless teachers feel reassured that they are in charge of their own professional development, there might be the risk that a tool like the e-portfolio will be resisted to such an extent that it never manages to fulfil its potential. That is why, ideally, the implementation of an e-portfolio system is a result of a bottom-up process in which teachers suggest its adoption as a means of conducting their own professional development.
