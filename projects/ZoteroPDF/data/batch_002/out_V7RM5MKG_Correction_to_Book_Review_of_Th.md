This is a correction to: Yonghua (Yoka) Wang, Lawrence Jun Zhang, The Routledge Handbook of Materials Development for Language Teaching, Applied Linguistics, 2023, amad024, https://doi. org/10.1093/applin/amad024

In the originally published version of this manuscript, there were several errors in the course of the review. These have been corrected as follows:

1. “Chapter 15 by Saraceni” should be “Chapter 15 by Thornbury”.   
2. “The last chapter by Masuhara is a review of the historical developments and the increasing importance of materials development” should be “materials adaptation”   
3. “Gray, J. 2016. ‘ELT materials: Claims, critiques and controversies’” in J. Hall (ed.): The Routledge Handbook of English Language Teaching. Routledge, pp. 96–108.’ should be “G. Hall”   
4. “Chapter 21 by Buchanan and Norton concentrates on how coursebooks are visioned” should be “how coursebooks are versioned”   
5. “In addition, the volume is limited to discussing issues related to language teaching materials in European and African contexts” should be “In addition, notwithstanding efforts to include chapters on non-English-dominant contexts, e.g. Spain, Turkey, Japan and SubSaharan Africa, the volume lacks a comprehensive and in-depth discussion of issues related to language teaching materials in Asian contexts.’”
