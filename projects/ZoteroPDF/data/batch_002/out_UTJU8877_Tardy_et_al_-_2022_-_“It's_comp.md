# ABSTRACT

Keywords: Genre-based pedagogy Genre awareness Teacher research Teacher education Teacher knowledge

This article shares a year-long qualitative study of six writing instructors' experiences with genrebased pedagogy (GBP). Through a collaborative research approach, the study examines these teachers' perspectives on their challenges and successes with GBP in an English for general academic purposes writing classroom. Findings highlight challenges related to course aims, content, and structure, as well as successes related to the ability to use their content knowledge of genre to troubleshoot and further develop their use of GBP in the classroom. The findings suggest that teacher pedagogical content knowledge of genre develops in interaction with teachers' practice and should be supported by robust and on-going teacher training and support. The paper concludes by offering examples of how teacher support might address the challenges unique to genrebased pedagogy.

# 1. Introduction

Nearing the end of an hour-long discussion about his teaching, Jim puzzled over the tension he had faced during the past 16 weeks in effrts to adopt a genre approach in his frst-semestr writing course. Genre theory, he noted, made good sense as a way to un. derstand human communication:

This is how people communicate, this is how language works, thi is how communication works. There's patterns and there's successful patterns and les successful patterns and there's changes that hapen over time and, if you want to communicate in a certain situation, it helps to know how people communicate in that situation. (Interview $\# 3$

In the same breath, though, Jim wrestled with the reality of teaching first-year university students something about communication that might contribute to their development as writers: I think the idea of genre maps really well onto a lot of other discussions of language and of learning and of teaching. But for whatever reason, it's really hard to actually operationalize in the classrom"

(Interview #3). Jim's collague Ruby similarly lamented that she found it challenging \*to both help the students with their devel.   
opment of genre knowledge and develop my own knowledge of how to teach genre" (Written Reflection, emphasis in original).

These quotes from Jim and Ruby voice the concerns of all participants in this study, who were neither novice teachers nor un. familiar with genre theory. At the time of this research, they had all taught for several years in secondary and/or postsecondary contexts and were doctoral students researching literacy and writing development. The participants are also co-authors of this paper, an empirical exploration of genre-focused teaching from the perspectives of six writing instructors. As genre has become a key concept in EAP (Hyland, 2016) and genre-based pedagogy a mainstay of EAP instruction, researchers and practitioners should take notice of the struggles inherent in genre-based teaching.

Genre's centrality in EAP (Hyland & Shaw, 2016) dates back primarily to the 1990s and the publication of Swales (1990) now seminal book, enre Analysis. Over the past few decades, scholars have made great strides in developing genre-based pedagogy within EAP writing instruction, outining teaching straegies (e.g., Hyon, 2018; Johns, 1997), researching effcts of gere-based teaching e. g., Cheng, 2008; Yasuda, 2011), and highlighting the importance of metacognition (e.g., Negreti & McGrath, 2018). Surprisingly, however, litl aention has bee given  techer perspectives on the practicalitie of iplemening the approach in ther classrooms or to the kinds of teacher knowledge and expertise that are needed to do so (see Li et al., 2020, as an excetion). These gaps are particularly relevant to the teaching of genre in the more general EAP classrooms found in early undergraduate writing instruction, such as first-year writig (Fw) in the United States or pre-university English preparation programs, where classrooms are typically made up of students from a broad range of discipline. It can be difficult in thesesettings for the teachers and students to know which genres to focus on, given the diversity of students' needs, interests, and trajecories, as well as the instructor's potentiall limited disciplinary knowledge.

In this article, we extend previous research into genre-based EAP writing instruction through a year-long qualitative study of six writing teachers, who are also authors of this paper. ur goal is not to examine outcomes or effctivenes of genre-foused teaching or specific classroom practices; nstead, by exploring commonalities among practitioners experiences and perceptions, we hope to un. derstand the complexitie of adopting genre-based approaches in more general EAP settings like FYW. In doing so, we intend to shed light on the kinds of knowledge and resources that might facilitate teachers' attempts at genre-based instruction.

# 2. Teachers' perspectives on genre-based pedagogy

Genre-based pedagogy (GBP) was first described by Swales (1990), who identified task, discourse community, and genre as the foundational concepts of a new approach to teaching academic writing. GBP aims to raise students' awareness of how language is used to carry out rhetorical goals of acommunity through various categories f texts (genres). Swales' approach \*basicall laid out the framework for ESP pedagogy as we know it today (Flowerdew, 2015, p. 11). Cheng (2018) describes two instructional objectives of GBP: \*(1) to delop students awarenes of gnre analysis a a conceptual framework ..for guiding their further examination of genre samples . and (2) to increase students awarenes of discipline-specific features in research genres' (p. 31). Together, these objectives--building gere awareness and genre-specific knowledge, respectivelydevelop students overarching genre knowledge Tardy et al., 2020).

While some researchers have systematically examined teachers' experiences implementing EAP pedagogy in general (e.g., Wett. 2015), research on genre-based approaches in EAP is limite, despite the centrality of genre-based teaching in these settings. Such research is important because it ca illuminate aspects of a pedagogical approach that may be chllengingor rewardingto teachers and which may therefore impact student leaning. A small number of studies have investigated teachers' experiences with genre-based instruction and suggest that pre-service and in-service teacher support may be especially useful. Some studies have examined novice or experienced teachers who were new to GBP. For example, Min (2016) and Norris and Tardy (2006) both describe teachers new to L2 graduate writing courses struggling with lack of tols and reources to prepare clas activities in (2016) also identifies the teachers lack of metalanguage as a specific barrier. Notably, the teachers in these studies lacked any formal pre-or in-service support-support which may have improved their classroom experiences. Li et al. (2020) found that two novice teachers of graduate L2 writing experienced challenges with the inductive nature of GBP (which required a good deal of their clas time) but were able to leverage their knowledge of linguistcs to successuly incorporate languag learning into ther writing classs. Other studies have found that teachers may face challenges in determining which genres to teach (Racelis & Matsuda, 2013), building knowledge of relevant genres (Min, 2016; Worden, 2018), or adopting an approach that iffers from their previous experiences as teachers or students (Mapes et al., 2020. In some case, teachers struggle wth the concet f gnre itelf, though classoom experience and studen interactions seem to provide a source of teacher development in this area (Mapes et al., 2020; Tardy et al., 2018).

A smallr number of studies have explored how formal teacher education in genre might influence teachers' practices. Gebhard et a. (2013) examined observational field notes from an MA-TESL course on language and language leaning as well as interviews with and teaching material created by the students; similarly, de Oliveira and Wan (2014) observed how an elementary science teacher put SFL genre-based pedagogy into practice after completion of a course on language for educators. Both studies found that the \*teacher-students" were able to implement their knowledge of genre and SFL into instructional resources and practices, and that the metalanguage leaned in their courses was especiall helpful. Support for pre-service teacher traning is also found in Worden's (2019) one-semester study of pre-service teachers who cared out an extended analysis of an unfamiliar genre in a graduate course. The project helped the participants build their understanding of genre and gain some ability to anticipate student strugges. However, this study, like Gebhard et al's (2013), did not follow the instructors into implementation of GBP in their real-world teaching. Together, these studies suggest a potentially important role for formal and in-depth teacher education specifically in GBP.

One context that may be more challenging than others for GBP is what Johns (2008) refers to as \*novice academic clsrooms" (p.

237), often found in intensive/preparatory English programs or first-year undergraduate writing programs, which generall include required writing courses for students aross the university. In contrast to English for specificaademic purposes (EAP) classrooms where students typically share disciplinary backgrounds and goals, English for general academic purposes (EGAP) classrooms include students from a wide range of disciplines who will write in diverse genres outside of and after thir EAP course (see Caplan, 2019 or Caplan & Farling, 2017 for examples f relevant and meaningful genre selection). Given the impossbilit of teaching specific genres that meet llstudnts' nes in such  setting, scholars like Johs (2008) and Deit (2004, 2009) have instd advocated an mphasis on teaching for genre awarenes (a conscious understanding of what genre is and how it inluences textual choices) and on developing students rhetorical flexibilit, or thir ability to writ acros varied writing situations. Johns (2008) dicusses some of the challenges of teaching for genre awarenes, focusing on the ambiguity it may present for students, and she shares her personal strggles in finding a suitable genre-based approach in an EGAP context. Nevertheles, very litle empirical research has illuminated the challenges that typical clasroom teacherspresumably with les experience than Johnsface. I two semester-long studies of GBP in a FYW context however, Mapes et al. (2020) and Tardy et al. (2018)found that acohort of new instructors (who had no extended pre-service education in genre) faced increasing frustrations and challenges in making genre "teachable" (Mapes et al., 2020).

It is not surpring that instructors, especial novices, face challenges with GBP. It is an approach that demands extensive teacher knowledge: an understanding of concepts like genre, discourse community, and rhetoric; an understanding of the principles of genre based pedagogy; knowledge of which genres to teach (if given a choice) and a familiarity with those genres, including their features and uses; resources for designing and scafflding classoom activite, including discovery-oriented explorations of genres; and an understanding of students needs and learning approaches, to name just a few examples (se also Cheng, 2018). Drawing on Shulman's (1987) concept of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), Worden (2019) outlines a framework of PCK of genre that includes content knowledge of genre, knowledge of learners, pedagogical knowledge, and knowledge of curriculum (see Fig. 1). PCK of genre depicts the breadth of knowledge that teachers of genre pedagogy need, and it can indicate areas where their knowledge is sill emerging. Further reearch into teachers' PCK of genre can provide guidance for EAP programs to understand what kind of teacher education and support might facilitate teachers' classroom practices and, ultimately, student learning.

In this study, we extend previous explorations of teachers' experiences with genre pedagogy by engaging with teachers over a one. year period while they were planning and teaching "genre-informed' EGAP writing courses. Unlike the participants in most previous studies in this context, our teacher-participants were not new to teaching. They had also taken a semester-long graduate course in genre theory and pedagogy prior to ths study, potentially holding more sophisticated genre-related content knowledge and pedagogical knowledge than most teachers new to GBP might. Also uniquely, these teachers elected to implement GBP, in some form, in their lases. We se amongst these teachers how their prior education i genre theory and pedagogy informed their PCK of genre in their first semesters implementing such an approach. Despite these apparent advantages, however, the teachers sillfaced challenges, and we believe those challenges -as well as their successes are important to unpack, with the broader goal of identifying areas for eeded teacher education and support, especiall for teachers in EGAP writing cassrooms. Our primary research question was: What challenges and succeses o teachers (with some PCK of gere) encounter when teaching with a genre approach in a general academi FYW course?

# 3. Methodology

Our research began as a traditional qualitative study of si teachers but later re-positioned the participants as co-researchers who could bring thir unique perspectives and insights to the data. Our approach borrows from models by scholars like Duff et al. (2013), Ivanic (1998), and Motha (2014), who attempt to minimize and challenge the power hierarchies in their research in various ways, including repositioning participants as co-researchers (Ivanic, 1998) or study partners (Motha, 2014). In our study, the participants developing knowledge of genre and GBP, shared contextual knowledge, and roles as emerging writing scholars made a collaborative research model especially appealing.

One challenge of this approach to inquiry was determining how to write about the teacher-participants/co-researchers. Following Duff et al. (2013, we have opted to refer to the teacher-participants with pseudonyms and in the third person, to maintain anonymity and somealbeit artficialdistance between our participant-selves (frozen in the snapshots of our data) and our researcher-selves (reflecting on our data with some distance in space and time). This pronoun usage is not intended to mask the dual roles adopted by the authors but rather to provide us with a means for shuttling between these roles and identities.

# 3.1. Participants' contexts

At the time of the study, the six participating tachers were rhetoric and composition or applied linguistics PhD students with one to three years experience teaching FW at the research site, a large university in the United States. Several had prior teaching experience, including high school English, English as a foreign language, adult ESL, universty foreign language (non-English), and community college writing. They had ll ompleted a year-long practicum in their first year of teaching for the writing program. Because the practicum was designed for all new graduate student teachers in the program (many of whom had not taught before), it focused primarily on basic teaching strategies (e.g, essn planning, classroom management, etc.) and provided ageneral overview of principles in writing pedagogy (eg, the writing process, providing written feedback, etc.). Genre and GBP were not prominently addressed, in part because the FYW curriculum did not emphasize them at the time the participants werenrolled in the practicum, one to three years prior to this study.

In the semester prior to this study the participating teachers completed a 16-week elective graduate seminar taught by Chris Tardy, where they developed a fairly robust understanding of genre theories, methods of researching and analyzing genres, and genre-based pedagogies. In the course, participants engaged with an interdisciplinary orientation to genre studies by exploring insights from applied inguistc, rhetoric and compositio, and education. Throughout the semester, they engaged in discussions about genre-based pedagogy, including video discussions with cholars such as Ann Johns, Amy Devit, and Anis Bawarshi. They also created numerous pedagogical activities and completed individual research projects. While this study is not meant to be a direct evaluation of the graduate seminar's impact, is influence became clear in the teachers emerging familiarity with genre scholarship and through the metalanguage they used to discuss their teaching during interviews. Thus, unlike the novice instructors engaging with GBP in other studies (e.g., Mapes et al., 2020; Tardy et al., 2018), these instructors already held a strong theoretical and pedagogical foundational knowledge of genre.

The writing program at our university serves a large and diverse undergraduate population through a two-course curriculum designed to be taken in students firs year of study. Students are not grouped by discipline, so each YW classroom of 2025 students is heterogeneous in terms of students' disciplinary interests. In addition to \*mainstream' courses, which serve primarily domestic stu. dents (many of whom are multilingual), the program offers sections of the courses specifically for international EAL students. The courses teach toward the same learning outcomes but are adapted to meet the unique needs of multilingual and transnational writers.

This study began during a curricular transition in the writing program toward a genre-informed aproach that emphasized developing students' awarenessof genre and discourse communities. Thus, it is important to note that most students in the FYW program had not previously ben taught writing through GBP, since the approach was not used prior to the start of the study and is generally uncommon in U.S. high schools and in the writing courses that international students have taken previously. During th irst semester of our study, the writing program had just begun piloting a genre-informed course in the first semester of the two-semester course sequence; three of the teachers in this study helped implement and asses that pilot course. The teachers not implementing the pilot syllabus had more flexibilit in their course design and teaching approaches. Variation and flexibility in teachers aproaches was thus partially due to the courses and students (domestic or international) they were teaching. Inthe first semester of the study, the instructors differed slightl in theirassignment sequences (see Table 1) and the extent to which genre and genre analysis were sus tained throughout their courses. With limited space, we offer only broad descriptions of these variations here.

Table 1 Participants' teaching assignments.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Teacher</td><td>First Semester Teaching</td><td>Second Semester Teaching</td></tr><tr><td>Fred</td><td>English 101 (2 sections)</td><td>English 102-EAL (2 sections)</td></tr><tr><td>Jim</td><td>English 101</td><td>(did not teach)</td></tr><tr><td> Rebecca</td><td>English 101-EAL (2 sections)</td><td>English 101-L1/EAL blend (2 sections)</td></tr><tr><td>Ruby</td><td>English 101-L1/EAL blend</td><td>English 102-EAL</td></tr><tr><td>Sydney</td><td>Honors FYW</td><td>Advanced composition</td></tr><tr><td>Wanda</td><td>English 101 (2 sections)</td><td>English 101</td></tr></table></body></html>

Note. "EAL' refers to sections designated for international students using English as an additional language. "L1/EAL blend" sections included a 50/50 blend of domestic and international students. Sections not labeled \*EAL" or "L1/EAL blend" include primarily, but not exclusively, English L1 students.

Jim, Rebecca, and Wanda used the writing program's pilot syllabus, which emphasized explorations of discourse communities partially through genre analysis. Assignments included a narrative of a public event, a discourse communit profile, a genre analysis essay, and a reflectie portfolio. Explici discussion of genre in this syllabus was primarily confined to a four-week unit in which students analyzed a genre used by the community they had profiled in the previous unit ultimately writing an essay of their findings. Ruby, though not officilly involved in the course pilo, adapted the gre analysis unit from the pilot syllabus for her own asigment arc. Her classfocused more pecifically on exploring academic discourse communities and included a literacy narrative reflecting on past writing experience, a genre analysis eay relatd tostudents discilinary interests, and acultural analysis eay that considered similarities and tensions between the values in their past and potential future disciplinary writing.

Fred and Sydney elected not to use the program's pilot course syllabus but sill incorporated genre-based approaches. Fred pri marily focused on genre within a unit on literacy narrative. He deigned a sequence of gere-based, discovery-oriente activities early in the first semester, prompting students to identify the rhetorical situation and find \*core features" and variation of the genre before writing their own iteracy narraties. Sydney taught an honors section of FYw and emphasized exploration of discourse and genre throughout the semester by discussing academic and disciplinary writing conventions. Her major assgnments included a genre-based approach to writing a literacy narrative about students personal engagement with reading, writing, and language, which included analyzing examples in order to discover features typical of literacy narratives; a mini-ethnography exploring the use of a genre in a discourse community, a genre analysis of assgnment shees from students current academic clases; and a reflection on the writing students encountered throughout the semester. The teachers' trajectories are represented visually in Fig. 2.

Though the depth and duration of the teachers atentionto genre differed slightl, they all emphasized teaching genre awareness through activities exploring multiple genre samples, identifying common patterns and variations, and connecting these patterns to broader rhetorical contexts and goals. We do not view the instructors varied approaches as a limitation to this research but instead as an opportunity to understand teachers individual approaches to genre-based teaching. Indeed, during the second semester of the study, the instructors described adjusting ther own approaches as their PCK of genre developed more fully through classoom practice in the first semester.

# 3.2. Participants' backgrounds and interests

Each participant came to the study with unique backgrounds and interests as relevant to GP. Below, the participants draw on thei. interview transcripts and writtenrelections, to provide readers with a glimpse into their emerging PCK of genre at the start of the study.

Fred: At the beginning of the study, I was first-year PhD student in applied linguistics and had taught FYW for one year. I also had some experience teaching EFL. When entering graduate school, I had not intended to specialize in L2 writing or composition, a I later did, but rather stumbled into this field through teaching as a graduate student. Having very littl experiences writing profssioal, I wanted to learn more about the field and writing pedagogy in general. The genre seminar seemed like a good place to gain that knowledge and expertise. In my first year as a writing instructor, I did not encounter any specific challenges that would push me to want to learn more about genre specificall, but I likely enrolled in the course because the topic sounded intersting and I thought perhaps it could help me teach more confidently.

Fig. 2. Visual representation of research participation and teaching approaches.

Jim: I was a second-year PhD student in rhetoric and composition and was beginning my 4th year teaching FYW at the start of the research. A series of conversations with Chris [Tardy] led me toward integrating genre in my teaching a few years before our graduate course. I wanted to help students see writing as "a series of choices," and I believed a genre-based approach would be helpful for "making those choices visible, making the conventions visible, making the history of why they exist visible" (Interview $\# 1$

Rebecca  was a second-year PhD student in applied linguistics at the start of the study. I had prior experience in (foreign) language teaching but was just beginning my second year f teaching FYw. My interest in genre developed during the seminar taught by Chris, which simultaneously overwhelmed me and changed my thinking about teaching, leading me to value contextualizing texts for students, exposing them to multiple genres, and providing them with analytic tols. Early on in the study, I struggled with \*utting theory and practice together," and rather than drawing on specific genre scholars my clases became a giant melting pot of genre theory, ideas" (Interview $\# 1$

Ruby: At the time of the study, I was beginning my fourth year of teaching in the writing program and my firs year as a PhD student in applied linguisic. I was especially interested in helping students transition into academic ways of writing without ignoring their personal values and non-academic strengths. As academic writing was usually not taught in the disciplines at this university, my main goal was to make the FYW course "meaningful' by \*easing [students] into the academic communities" (Interview $\# 1$ ). I also wanted to help students bridge their past experiences to their future (professinal) goals, and I thought that a GBP approach would help by drawing their attention to how values of discourse communities show up in writing.

Sydney: I began the genre seminar with littlebackground knowledge of genre theory, but I was excited to enhance my teaching and pedagogical sills. One influential activit during the seminar was gathering a corpus of conference abstracts-both those that had been accepted and those that had been rejected. Analyzing the common patterns within these abstracts helped me write my own conference abstract, and I saw the relevance of a genre approach within my own writing. I wanted to use this knowledge to help students in my own classroom see the relevance as well.

Wanda: I began the study as a second-year PhD student in rhetoric and composition who had taught FYW for 4 years at the same university. My interest i genre emerged from a research project completed prior to Chris's seminar in which I tilized Miler's (1984) article "Genre as Social Action. Theories and practices introduced in the genre seminar helped me further integrate genre into my research and teaching. The work of Hyland, Swales, Bhatia, and Devitt gave me the language to talk about genre and greater confidence in my purose as a writin instructor. After learning about nre, I felt lik I had more to offer my student, and my classroom was re-centered on actually talking about writing and how it works' (Interview #1). My primary goal was to help students learn to make more rhetorically effective genre choices across contexts..

# 3.3. Data collection and analysis

Formal data collection was carried out during a full academic year. Data collection focused on gathering teachers perspectives and reflections on their experience with genre-based instruction rather than on extensive observation of classroom teaching. Chris conducted four $^ 2 3 0 { - } 6 0 \mathrm { m i n }$ interviews with each participant, discussing the challenges and successes of implementing genre pedagogies in their writing courses. Each interview was recorded and transcribed. During interviews, the teachers shared relevant course materials such s syllabi, ssiment shees, rubric, and classroom actvitie to ilstrate their pproches to genre-based teching. In addition, Chris observed at least one classession for each teacher, taking field notes and audio recording the leson for later review. At the end of the academic year, the teacher-participants read their own interview transcripts and wrote one-to six-page reflections on the themes they had identified in ther individual data sets. These refections also discussed the overall chllenges, suceses, and rewards of teaching with a genre approach and described how the instructors' knowledge of genre and writing instruction informed their teaching. The interview transcripts (23 total), course materials, field notes, and written refections (6 total) constituted the data analyzed for this study.

After all data had been collected, the teachers expressed interest in moving to a collaborative research model. We began meeting regularly over the subsequent two years to discuss the data, first informally and then through a systmatic recursive proces of oding the interview transcripts and wrien reflections (Saldana, 2016). Course materials and fieldnotes were consulte later in the analysis process to corroborate, illustrate, or problematize the coded interview and reflection data.

Our research question and the initial themes we identified led us to explore the teachers' perceived rewards of GBP and the challenges of implementation. As a group, we developed coding categories based on these themes and then applied the codes to subsets of the data in pairs. The whole group then discussed intial coding and further reined these coding categories. The entire dataset was then double-coded using collaborative coding software (Dedoose), with any ambiguity or disagreements resolved through group discussions. Our final coding scheme included two overarching categories (rewards and challnges of GBP), with several sub-codes identifying major themes within those categories.

# 4. Findings

In their interviews and written reflections, the teachers shared many challenges and successes related to genre-informed teaching Here, we discusthe most prominent of these within three broad areas: course aims, course content, and course tructure.

# 4.1. Course aims: teaching for genre awareness

All six teachers began our study with relatively clear goals of wanting their courses to help develop students' genre awareness

Regardles of their individual syllabi or asignment sequences, they all wanted their students to understand writig as situated and dependent on audience, context, and purpose. Because of their experiences in the genre seminar, they were familiar with scholarship on and strategies fr teaching gere awarenes (e.g., Devitt 2009; Johns, 2008), and they elt that adopting GBP in FYW could allow them to highlight rhetorical context and the flexibility and situatedness of writing. All of the teachers emphasized, in their written reflections or interviews, that genre was relevant to students lives and could help develop metacognitive knowledge that would transfer to new contexts. The participants described genre as being "more beneficial' (Sydney, Interview $\# 1$ , "more meaningful" (Ruby, Interview $\# 2$ , and \*more tangible" (Rebecca, Written Reflection) than other approaches to writing instruction. They also expressed the belef that GBP could preparestudents better by moving beyond \*the essay-centered writing classroom" (Wanda, Written Reflection). At the end of one year of teaching in this way, Fred reflected that a genre approach

has the potential to instil in leaners asense of rhetorical flexbility, critical reasoning, and empathy which not only helps them overcome the idea that writing is formulaic and pre-conceived but also to become a full member of the community. (Written Reflection)

Despite the strong theoretical appeal, however, the teachers ften struggled to define what genre awareness might look like in their classrooms or to describe specifi strategie for teaching and assesing it, especiall throughout the first semester of the study. At the end of that semester, Jim, who taught from the program's pilot syllabus, shared perhaps the most frustration with the vaguenes of genre awareness as a concept, asking pointedly:

What does genre awareness" mean? Awareness of what? Awareness of the fact that there are genres? OK, I think that maybe we achieved that in [my] course, maybe. Do we mean awareness of specific ways that genres do things? Do we mean awarenessof how to operationalize genres? Do we mean awareness of how to analyze genres? What is it that we're asking students to be aware of? Do we ask them to be aware of linguistic strategies and how they work in genres? Be aware of visual design? . that's part of this question, how to assess genre awareness. (Interview $\# 3$

Here we seetensions within Jim's PCK of genre as he struggles to bring his content knowledge of genre and his own awareness of the complexit f genre awareness i line with his nowledge of the program currculum. He recognizes the multifaceted nature of genre awareness but also shows frustration as he questions which aspects should be foregrounded in his pedagogy and asssment.

We found questions similar to Jim's arising repeatedly in the teachers' interview transcripts and written reflections. The partici. pants drew on definitions of genre awareness by readings fatured in their genre seminar (e.g., Devit, 2009) when describing thir course aims early on, but as their casses progrese, they became more concerned with how such goals might be achieved or assessed. Ruby, who adapted a genre analysis unit from the pilot syllabus, explained that some of her students \*did employ greater genre awarenes than  had expected (Interview #3), as evidenced through their use of certain formal features in their genre analysis papers (an abstract, headings, methods section). At the same time, she also wondered if this \*awareness may have been simply a re-use of conventions found in sample texts rather than a metacognitie awareness of genre. Both Ruby and Jim questioned whether sophisticated metacognitive genre awarenesscould realitically be developed in a 16-week writing course, especially when all students were exploring different genres.

An additional challenge for teachers was balancing theoretical alignments to create and articulate pedagogical practices that would carry out their individual goal. For example, some of the teachers found it dfficult to focus on genre awarenes without also supporting learning of specific genres and their conventions. Fred, who focused his curriculum on the literacy narrative genre, noted, want the two aspectsa strong product and, at the same time, strong awarenes of gnre and audience. I don't know how to get there at this point (Interview #3). In response to this challenge, many of the teachers selected and synthesied from various approaches to genre pedagogy. Ultimately,all six teachers focused on both teaching genre awarenes and teaching at least some features f specific genres, resulting in a more blended approach with the kind of balance advocated by Cheng (2018). As Rebecca described, I realize there are different [gnre] thories and different approaches, but at the same time, I kind of melddthem all toether Interview #1) As Fred and Rebecca show, the teachers prior content knowledge (se Fig. 1) of genre pedagogies, developed in part through the genre seminar, equipped them with knowledge of different approaches and led them to consider how those might be combined. Without specific guidance for teaching GBP through their writing program, though, they largely developed their emerging curricular knowledge of genre (see Fig. 1) by struggling through and reflecting on their own classroom experiences.

Despite these challenges, the teachers did experience moments of successrlated to their course aims. All six described the most rewarding teaching during the study as points in which students seemed to "getit demonstrating an understanding of how contexts and texts mutually shape one another. During the interviews, all of the teachers shared stories of students experiencing these a-ha moments. One example is found in the following excerpt from Rebecca's final interview:

I feel like they started to get it with prodding and with time, they fially started to understand. And . they--ot al f them, but a lot of them--who chose to [analyze] a syllabus as the genre, and a lot of them, it kind of opened their eyes, and they kept coming back to me and telling me, Wow, I didn't realize that teachers didn't write everything!" And, Look at this! And look at that!' So, this is successful, for at least some of them. (Interview $\# 4$ -

Sydney and Fred similarly found heightened awareness i students' final course reflections. Sydney recalled that the reflections howed the students were \*thinking about audiences and thinking about casses as discourse communities, and there was a common heme of this is gonna make me more successful in my next classes'" (Interview #3).

Finally, three of the teachers (Rebecca, Sydney, and Wanda) noted that using a genre approach allowed them to bring their own expertise to the classroom. Their developing content knowledge of genre, stemming from the graduate seminar and actively honed through practice, gave them a sense of engagement and confidence that positively impacted their teaching. As Wanda noted at the end

of the first semester:

.. with the genre approach, because I'm so interested in it, and I'm thinking about it both in my scholarship and in practice, I fee ike I'm kind of more an expert on something here. And that helps me to engage [students] more, and I think it improves my credibilit a littlebit with them to because they're like, "K, so she's into this and she knows what she'stalking about, and it's something I don't know about already." (Interview $\# 3$

These three teachers feelings of expertise in genre fostered through the graduate seminar, contrast with those of novice teachers ithout formal instruction in genre theory in previous studies (Mapes et al., 2020; Tardy et al., 2018), suggesting that these intructors :ontent knowledge of genre played an important role in their teaching practice.

# 4.2.  Course content: which genres to teach?

Although the teachers primary goal of GBP was to develop students metacognitive genre awareness, teachers stil needed to select genres for students to analyze and produce (this chllnge is similarly discusse in Caplan, 2019; Calan & Farling, 2017; Johns, 2019, and Racelis & Matsuda, 2013). This particular challenge is ikely to be unique to--or at least more pronounced in-an EGAP context like FYW, where students do not have a shared academic trajectory or developed disciplinary knowledge, and where instructors are also often limited in their knowledge of writing practices across disciplines. Thus, selecting genres that directly prepare students for writing in the disciplines may not be the most effective or realistic approach.

In Fred's course, where genre analysis was limited to one major unit, students analyzed the literacy narratie as a genre just before writing their own. In the clas session that Chris observed, students identified common features and variations of literacy narraties based on sample texts and their own literacy narrative plans. In contrast, Sydney's students analyzed numerous genres used within their discourse communities, and by looking at writing assignment guidelines collected from their disciplinary courses. In the genre analysis unit used by the other four teachers, students analyed a gnre of their choice to understand how a community use it t carry out a goal or set of goals" and \*to explore a community's values based on the genre you analyze (Classrom Materials). Students in these clases selected a wide range of geres to explore, including menus, workplace memos, a dean's weekly emails to students, and film analyses. In addition, all six teachers used smaller awareness-raising tasks to unpack the genres of the major course assinments, such as literacy narratives, profiles genre analysis essays, and public arguments. Many of the teachers introduced genre analysis through familiar genres, as suggested by Johns (1997) and demonstrated in the genre seminar.

For the genre analysis unit in the pilot curriculum, Jim, Rebecca, and Wanda had hoped their students would explore genres and communities of special relevanceto them, boosting their engagement in the assgnment and perhaps even increasing the possbility for transfer of learning. However, some students struggled to identify a genre they could analyze in any real depth. One of Reberca's students analyzed clothing tags, a genre that Rebecca flt probably required a more sophisticated undersanding of genre than the students could develop in the short timespan of the course. Ruby's asignment encouraged her students to explore a genre "used withn your major field (lassrom Materials), but many ended up exploring non-academic genres. As Ruby stated, Some of the students ust chose genres that, you know, in hindsight, I should have just told them, No, you can't write about that" (Interview $\# 3$ ). Through classrom experience and reflection, Ruby and Rebecca were able to recognize the limitations of their speci assinment guidelines and communications with students as well as the potential limitations of the genre analysis essay assignment more generall.

In fact, allof the instructors who assigned a gere analysis eay had smilar concerns about it efficacy and struggle to determine Which geres students should actually compose in FY course. In the first semester, Jim, Rebeca, Ruby, and Wanda all drew from the writing program's sample asignment, which asked students to present their genre analysis in the form of an analytic paper with a central ideato focus the analysis. These guidelines also stipulated support and \*evidence from sample texts, and possibly interviews and observations" with genre users (Clsroom Materials). The assgnment was adapted from the approach taken in Devitt, Reiff and Bawarshi's (2004) genre-based FYW textbook (also discussed in the genre seminar) and concentrated into one course unit. While an analytic essay is a relatively common FYW assgnment, it might also be considered what Wardle (2009) has called a \*mut genre (a genre that seems to have no rhetorical purpose beyond \*practice" or demonstration of some specific knowledge or sill. The analytic essay felt particularly out of place to these teachers when trying to raise students' awareness of writing astuated. As Wanda explained:

The thing I hate about having a genre analysis unit is that it always, or often, culminates into an esay. It's so weird. . Too often I'm just so focused on just trying to talk about genre and practice analyzing them, so we don't really get a lot of time to talk about the [fia] product, which is what they're writing.. wouldnt have them write necessarily a enre analys essay in the future] ... ecause, I think what's gonna happen, probably, is that they're gonna be five-paragraph essays. (Interview #2)

The teachers then faced the question of what students should do to develop and demonstrate their genre awareness, if not writing nalysis essay. One potential solution was proposed by Ruby when reflecting on how she might modify her course in the future: ask lents to produce the genre they analyzed, not necessarily in order to learn' it but rather to contrbute to their genre awarenes.

In the end, the question of which genres students should explore and compose was linked to the tensions that many of the par. ticipants experienced in ther instructional aims. That is, in teaching for genre awareness in the EGAP context, the teachers opted to emphasize broad metacognitive genre awareness, yet in doing so, they often felt they were foregoing the opportunit to develop such genre awareness through the more guided practice of exploring conventions of specific academic genres. The teachers' emerging content knowledge of gere and metalanguage stemming from the genre seminar allowed them to recognize and articulate this tension, but they were still developing the curricular or pedagogical knowledge that would help them to address i in their teaching.

# 4.3. Course structure: time and scaffolding

One of the most prominent challenges for the teachers was related to their knowledge of how to sequence assignments and tasks including knowing how much time to devote to various activities. Allbut Sydney (whose course focused on genre throughout the term) found that addressing the complexities of genre required much more cass time than they had originally anticipated. As Jim stated midway through the first semester:

the time thing is huge. I just don't know how in a one-semester course for first-semester students to talk about genre in a way that's productive .. while also trying to do other things. Right? It's ..such a short amount of time, its like four weeks [dedicated specifically to genre analysis] ... And it's just not enough time. (Interview #2)

Fred similarly lamented having insufficient time to address genre in a meaningful, in-depth way, writing, \*At times, I thought that my activities were somewhat rushed and remained too superficial. More time and individual support would have been required for every student to grasp the basic goals of the assignments and how to achieve them' (Written Reflection).

Closely related to time constraints was the teachers' growing understanding of the crucial role of scaffolding in genre-informed pedagogy. Rebecca described feeling that the conceptual complexit of genre necesstated even more scaffolding than usualto keep students from feeling overwhelmed:

Over the course of the year, I worked on my materials so that I could better scaffold the genre analysis ssignment. I'm still not sure if theres a right or wrong way to scaffold . Since genre is so complex and students arent used to talking about it explicitly, we need to equip them with the necessary tools, but its easy to overwhelm them with too much information all a once. (Written

Reflection)

Rebecca's comments are echoed in scholarly discussions of genre instruction (e.g., Cheng, 2018; Hyland, 2007; Johns et al., 2006) which advise breaking genre analysis into more manageable steps and emphasize the critical role of scafolding. The teachers all agreed with Rebecca's succinct rflection on the challenges related to both time and a need fr careful, guided scaffolding in their genre-based teaching:

What I've started to understand about genre is it's not easy. It's complicated and nuanced, and it takes a lot of time. Lots of examples. And I don't think I had enough time or enough examples. (Rebecca, Interview #3)

In wrestling with this challenge, some of the teachers returned to ideas they had learned about in the graduate seminar on genre For example, several noted the strong potential of the kind of scaffolding found in SFL genre teaching, such as the teaching/learning cycle (Rose & Martin, 2012), an approach never discussed in the writing program in which the instructors were teaching.

Other teachers drew on their interactions with students to reasses their teaching strategies and develop new approaches. In the interview following an observation of Jim's teaching, he noted how \*there was something missing' in the class initia discussion of genres. Students in his cass weren't seeing the main goal that \*communities shape genres" (Interview #2). During this interview, Jim considered creating a very simple handout with ust two columns for guiding students analysis: \*What do you notice? And why?You know, like something relly specific, reall simple. Like there's formal language. Why is it formal language? Right?" (Interview #2). Jim implemented this approach later in the course with positive outcomes.

In reflecting on their practice, the teachers eventually came to se genre not as simply a concept to introduce to students and hope they remember but rather as a framework for exploring writing throughout a course. With this developing curricular knowledge, in the second semester of the study, the teachers modified their courses, re-using and building on genre analysis tools throughout. For example, Reecca noted positive outcomes from a wellscaffolded set of gre analysis activities that utilized a cavenger hunt, viual slides, and tasks with graphic organizers. Wanda described a successful use of the teaching/learning cycle focusing on rhetorical moves. After reflcting on their challenges with timing and scafflding, many of the teachers were ultimately ableto revise their approaches and experience moments of success.

# 5. Discussion: understanding teachers' emerging PCK of genre

These six teachers experiences with GBP differed somewhat from the experiences of novice FYW teachers in other studies (e.g., Mapes et al., 2020; Tardy et al., 2018; Worden, 2018), and PCK of genre provides a useful lens for understanding these differences Having begun to build content and pedagogical knowledge (Fig. 1) of genre and GBP through their graduate coursework, the in. structors were les overwhelmed by the larger concepts of genre pedagogy, and they did not need to be convinced of its value or relevance in teaching writing. Throughout their interviews, for example, they referenced concepts such as genre awareness, the teaching/learning cycle, moves analysi, and rhetorical consciousnes-raising. They also referred to scholarly discussions about explicit intruction or various orientations to GBP. All these topics were covered in the genre seminar. This kind of content and pedagogical knowledge provided the teachers with resources for exploring new options in their teaching, as in the example of Wanda implementing the teaching/learning cycle and Jim creating a simplified analysis activity helping students to connect genre conventions with their audience and purpose. At the end of the study, Ruby described developing PCK of genre as a largely tacit proces, saying, "a lot of my own knowledge and teaching about genre is more implicit so that even when I didn't consciously think I'm using a genre approach,' I still drew on my previous work with genre' (Written Reflection).

The teachers' content and pedagogical knowledge also contributed to their positive attitudes toward GBP and, in some cases, feeling that they had special expertise to share with students. Thus, in line with previous studies (de Oliveira & Wan, 2014; Gebhard et a., 2013; Worden, 2019), our resarch lends support to the value f pre-service formal learning about genre and GBP (in this case, in the form of a graduate seminar). Such formal education can help teachers to start building their content and pedagogical knowledge, which provide invaluable resource for their classroom practice. The struggles that the participants faced often arose from the process of implementing this content and pedagogical knowledge into their cassrooms, but these struggles were much les overwhelming and negative than those expressed by the novice teachers in other studies (Mapes et al., 2020; Tardy et al., 2018).

The development of PCK of genre for the teachers in the present study may well have been aided by the positive attitudes they already held toward GBP, attitudes which likely related in part to a confidence in their content knowledge of gere and perhaps as we discuss below) in part to the opportunities they had for on-going reflection as part of this research. As Lee and Yuan (2021) note, "teachers' passion, enthusiasm, and commitment [can prompt] them to reflect, adapt, and change, contributing to their (adaptive) expertise (p. 9) It is also important to note that the participants' challenges were often linked to tensions betwen their fairl well developed content and pedagogical knowledge of genre and their emerging currcular knowledge and knowledge of learners. In other words, as Worden's (2019) model of PCK of genre sugges, content and pedagogical knowledge are necessary but insufficient components of knowledge for teachers of genre-based instruction.

The teachers in ths study largely built their knowledge of curriculum and learners (as defined by Worden [2019]) through ther pedagogical practice, and their EGAP context smed topresent specific challenges here, similar to novice instructors i other studies (e.g., Mapes et a., 2020; Tardy et al. 2018). With the eneral population of students i their W clas comin from a wide variet of majors, the teachers had limited knowledge of both the lateral currculum (concurrent genres students would be writing) and the vertical curriculum (past and future genres students would encounter). These knowledge gaps most prominently affected the four teachers who taught the genre analysistask prescribed in the program's pilot curriculum. Although these four instructors allvalued teaching genre awarenes, their prior content knowledge of genre conflicted with aspects of the gre analysisassinment-particularly regarding the genres students chose to analyze and the final product of a genre analys essy. With the wide range of student goals and disciplinary affiliations within their clases, the teachers truggled to provide students with actionable strategies for analyzing thir chosen genres and for helping them to build genre awareness.

In addition, the teachers pedagogical practices further developed and reinforced their content knowledge of genre. In his final interview, Jim discussed teaching genre in a \*kind of systematic way," as advocated by the "Australian model, based on his experiences in the classroom. Reflecting on his growing commitment to more explicit genre teaching methods, he said,

If I were to do the clas again, would I be able to find a better balance? Maybe. Just because Ifeel so much stronger about it now, or I feel pretty certain that this is what I want to include, more explicit modeling or strategies, or however you want to put it. (Interview $\# 3$

Here we see an example of the bidirectional nature of PCK shown in Fig. 1: Jim's content knowledge of a range of genre pedagogies influenced actvities he trie in clas, and the efetiveness of thee stratees fed back into his apreciation of partcular frameworks and his overall understanding of GBP. Rebecca similarly recognized how classroom practice informed her own content knowledge of genre. Her final writen reflection noted that in her interviews she had talked les about theory and more bout \*my own experience in the classroom, what had worked wel and what hadn't." She also decribed a growing confidence as she was able to put her thoretical knowledge into practice and to rflect on it pragmatic capabilitie. She wrote, As it turns out I wanted to know how to teach genre before I tarted so that I could be confident, but my confidence came bit by it a I got in and did the actual nitt gittyclasroom work" (Written Reflection).

As these examples demonstrate, the teachers did build their PCK of genre over the two semesters of this study as they modified their teaching and learned more about the students and their understandings of and struggles with genre. For example, recognizing their challenges with time-a challenge also faced by the teachers i Li et al.s (2020) study of GBP-and the constraints of asingle genre analysis unit all of the teachers infused genre analys throughout their courses in their second semester of genre-based teaching, and they learned to more heavily scaffold all of their activities. Additionall, the teachers in this study gradually came to see genre awareness and genre-specific learning not as two separate instructional aims (as presented in some readings in the graduate seminar and, to some extent, i the writing program assignment prompts that some of the teachers used) but rather as two mutull supporting components of genre knowledge and interrelated learning objectives.

In exploring these teachers emerging PCK of genre, we recognize, like Worden (2019), that it can be difficult to tease out concrete differences between the four domains of knowledge comprising one's PCK (content knowledge of genre, knowledge of learners, pedagogical knowledge, and knowledge of currculum). Our research provides further support for viewing these domains as over. lapping and mutually contributing. We see, for example in the teachers' reflective comments, that their developing knowledge of curriculum and leaners was directly supported by their nowledge of genre theories and pedagogies, and that their content knowledge of genre theories and pedagogies was continuously informed and refined by their practices.

# 6. Conclusion and implications

This study contributes to the limited research into teachers' experiences implementing GBP in EGAP contexts by exploring the challenges and successe faced by six teachers in a first-year writing program at a U.S. university. The teachers were neither genre teaching novices nor experts but rather somewhere in-between-\*emerging experts, perhaps. These teachers brought with them an interest and prior formal education in GBP, both of which seemed to support their persistence in adopting a genre approach through two semesters of instruction despite numerous challenges.

Echoing previous studies (de Oliveira & Wan, 2014; Gebhard et al., 2013; Worden, 2019), we found that prior formal education in genre supported the teachers in our study in adopting a genre approach in their FYW classrooms. This education specificaly bolstered their content knowledge of genre and GBP, contributed to their theoretical rationale for pedagogical choice, and provided them with some resources for pedagogical practice. Because they understood the larger goal of GBP (to develop students' genre awareness and flexibility as writers, they persisted in working through their classoom challenges (cf. Mapes et al., 2020). Their struggles often occurred i the proces of adapting this content knowledge in an EGAP context, as they contended with the realities of curricular content and student interests. Like other teachers, those in our study also faced challenges in properly scaffolding instruction within the time constraints of the classoom (Li et al., 2020). They also encountered concerns more specificall tied to teaching an EGAP writing course such as how much to emphasize genre awareness vs genre-specific knowledge (Johns, 2008) and which genres to incorporate (Racelis & Matsuda, 2013). In EAP, genre-based approaches are ofen associated with ESAP courses, in which students share disciplinary afiliations and/or target genres (such as dissertations or theses).There have been fewer scholarly discussions or pedagogical examples of GBP in more general academic setings like pre- or early university academic writing courses. Our research suggests that teachers in these settings would benefit from more resources that point t relevant enre for geeral aademic settings, helping these instructors to utilize genre-specific knowledge as a resource for building genre awareness.

The challenges faced by the teachers in our study also point to potential practice for pre- and in-service education for teachers using a genre approach. For exampl, struggle i how to teach genre awareness might beaddressed through discussion of how genre awarenes and gnre-specific knowledge mutuall reinforce one another. Teachers can benefit from seeing, creating, and reflecting on examples of classroom activities that promote genre awareness through analysis of specific genres, and from exploring familiar and unfamilia genres themselve. This hands-on experience can help teachers scaffold content and anticipate the types of questions and needs that often arise during the genre analys process. To help teachers gauge their students' gere awareness teacher training can include collborative exploration and development of genre-based rubrics or formative asessment activities (see Acar, 2021, for examples).

The study also has implications for supporting teachers in course design and development. Our participants reported better out comes when they began to see and implement genre as an overarching framework rather than a standalone concept or assignment in an EGAP writing course. Instead of course curricula deigned around a genre analysis ssgnment, a i the writing program's pilo inthis research, curricula could emphasize genre analysis as an overarching strategy. Moves analysis (Jacobson et al., 2021) and joint construction (Caplan & Farling, 2017) could serve as examples of specific analysis strategies and teaching approaches. Such strategies can be useful in concert with discussion of overall course design and deciding upon which genres to teach. Resources such as Caplan and Johns's (2019) volume offer numerous possbilitie for imagining "good writing" beyond the essay. Finall, with genre as a framework for course organization, teacher training could consider scaffolding at both the unit and course level helping both new and experienced teachers to sequence activities that build genre knowledge and production over time.

As both the participants and researchers in this study, we universally agre that the refective process of the research itself also facilitated our development of more sophisticated PCK of genre a finding also noted by Li et al. (2020) and Worden (2018) -and helped us to bridge the gaps between content and pedagogical knowledge of genre and knowledge of the curriculum and learners. This finding may be unsurprising given the value of reflection in teacher development (Farrel, 2015; Worden, 2018), but it alsosuggests a critical role for in-service support for teachers new to GBP. Especially for experienced teachers who may not have the benefit of pre-service training, regular and systematic opportunities for collborative reflection (for example, through teacher discussions, professional learning communities, workshops, reading groups, action research, or pedagogical exchanges) can offr intructors a space to articulate struggles, pool pedagogical knowledge, and collaboratively develop new classroom resources and strategies. In other words, our study highlights the dual value of both formal education in genre and of on-going, in-service opportunities for reflection on genre-based teaching. Given the complexties of GBP, both approaches to teacher support are important in developing instructors' PCK of genre. Together, these opportunities can help instructors adapt a complex theoretical framework into an emerging-and rewarding-pedagogical expertise.

# Notes

1 Like the course described in Worden's (2018) study, this currculum might best be characterized as "somewhat genre-based," heavily emphasizing the writing process and student reflection but including genre awareness as a learning outcome. 2 In the first semester, interviews were held at the start, middl immediately after the classroom observation), and end of the term. In the second semester, interviews were held at the end; Jim did not teach during this semester and therefore was only interviewed three times.
