EFL students

The study explored EFL students' development of syntactic complexity by employing the Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) approach. A total of 214 tertiary EFL students from Southwest China were invited to write four argumentative essays over an academic semester. The unconditional models of LCGA were utilized to explore the optimal latent classes of students' development trajectories of syntactic complexity. The conditional models of LCGA were employed to investigate the predictive effect of English proficiency on the optimal latent classes. Results of the unconditional models revealed different latent classes of development trajectories for six indices of syntactic complexity rather than the remaining ones, which offers tentative evidence for the heterogeneity of L2 development trajectories. Results of the conditional models showed that English proficiency did not predict the membership in these latent classes. These results are discussed and implications for L2 instruction are attempted.

# 1. Introduction

Syntactic complexity has ben regarded as a benchmark of L2 language proficiency and development (e.g., Ansarifar et al., 2018; Mazgutova & Kormos, 2015; Vyatkina et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2022. Studies have shown that i correlates with writing qualit (e., Biber etal., 2016; Crossey & McNamara, 2014; Rahimi & Zhang, 2019; Taguchi e l., 2013; Yang et a., 2015; Zhang & Cheng, 2021). Several scholars have managed to conceptualize syntactic complexit (e.g., Bulte & Housen, 2014; Lu, 2011; Norris & Ortega, 2009. Bulte and Housen (2014) proposed a framework of L2 complexity distinguishing absolute and relative complexity, whichi further divided into ingustic complexity, dicourse-interactional complexity, and propositional complexity. Syntactic complexity is included as a component of linguistic complexity, sharing the same level with lexical, morphological, and phonological complexity. It has always been operationalized as a multidimensional construct in second language (L2) writing research, covering global, clausal and phrasal sub-construct (e.g, Lu, 2011, 2017; Mancilla et al., 2017; Norris & Ortega, 209; u et al., 2023). Scholars have proposed different quantitative measurements or indice to gauge syntactic complext, for instance, mean length of sentences, mean length of T-units, mean length of clauses, and finite dependent clause per T-unit, to name a few. These indices were criticized for being too general/large-grained and les sensitive to the development of specific structures (Kyle & Crossley, 2018; Norris & Ortega, 2009). To crack this thorny ssue, Kyle and Crossly (2018) put forward a group of fine-grained indices for tapping into the delicacy of syntactic complexity. However, these newly proposed indices were adopted in only a few available studies into the development of syntactic complexity It i necessary that more studies be conducted to corroborate the utilit of the newly proposed fine-grained indices for detecting the developmental nuances of L2 syntactic complexity.

Syntactic complexity has atracted an increasing number f scholars who have approached it from two different perspectives: Developmental and interactional. Those researchers adopting the interactional perspective examined various factors affecting syntactic complexity, for instance, proficiency (e.g., Ortega, 2003;), task complexity (e.g., Adams et al., 2015; Johnson, 2017; Nuevo, 2006; Yang, 2014), genre (e.g., Brs & Nagy, 2011; Larsson & Kaatari, 2020; Polio & Yoon, 2018), and L1 backgrounds (e.g, Lu & Ai, 2015). On the other hand, proponents of the developmental perspective focused on the growth of syntactic complexity indices cross-ectionall (e., Jiang et a., 2019; Kuiken & Vedder, 2019; i e l., 2022; Lu, 2010) or longitudinally (e.g., Bulte & Housen, 2014, 2018; Kyle et al., 2021; Polat et l., 2020; Vyatkina, 2012). It sems that these studies assumed that learners' development of syntactic complexity followed uniform developmental trends as a group, where the individual learners might be averaged when they are lumped together. As Bulte and Housen (2018) pointed out, the ssumed average learner does not exist. It has been further argued that a single average development trajectory might conceal significant individual differences and thus draw an invalid conclusion concerning the development of the variables involved (e.g., Andruff e al., 2009; Raudenbush, 2001. This homogeneous assumption might be in contradiction to the possble heterogeneity of development trajectories at the group level, which might be caused by learner variables and contextual factors. Furthermore, the heterogeneous development trajecories at the group level have been found in social and psychological phenomena, for instance, mathematics learning disabilities (Wong et al., 2014) and cohesion (Zhang & Zhang, 2023). Moreover, case studies on the development of syntactic complexity have accumulated (e.g., Bulte & Housen, 2014, 2018; Kyle et al., 2021; Lowie & Verspo0r, 2019; Polat et al., 2020; Vyatkina, 2012), demonstrating various degrees of intraindividual and interindividual variability. For that reason, it is imperative that group studies be conducted on the development of syntactic complexity to complement the available case studies.

To bridge the gaps in the liteature, our study aims to explore the longitudinal development of learners' syntactic complexity in EFL writing by employing Latent Clss Growth Analysis (LCGA). LCGA could facilitate the researcher i identifying the distinct group-level development trajectories from the collcted data without any prior knowledge concerning the trajectories (Andruf e al., 2009). In other words, it might help us t assemble individual learners fllowing a similar pattern of change over time into distinct groups. Thus, LCGA is advantageous over other techniques for statistical analyses in that i can effectively handle the heterogeneity problem in development studies (Andruff et a., 209; Berlin et al., 2014). Meanwhile, individual and group development trajectories might be adequately described through LCGA, which might offe us an effctive way to solve the design integration problem mentioned earlier. Besides, LCGA might alo ass in examining the predictiveffect of individual factors eg., proficiency level) n distinct development trajectories.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Syntactic complexity and its measurements

Syntactic complexity has been a well-established construct in the fields of L2 acquisition and L2 writing because its development is conceived to be integral to the learner's proficiency in the target second language (Lu, 2010) as wel as his writing proficiency in that language (Bulte & Housen, 2014). It has been defined in different ways by scholars (e.g., Lu, 2011; Ortega, 2003). Whereas Ortega referred to syntactic complexity as "the range f forms that surface in language production and the degre of sophistication of such forms" (2003, p. 492) Lu defined syntactic complexity as "the range of syntactic structures that are produced and the degre of sophistication of such structures" (2011, p. 36). The diversity and sophistication of syntactic structures are underscored in these definitions and, thus, should be measured appropriately. Syntactic complexity has been commonly recognized as a multidimensional construct, which covers three diferent levels/dimensions: Global complexity, phrasal complexity, and clausal complexity (Norris & Ortega, 2009).

After a meta-analysis and synthesis of syntactic complexity studies published from 2004 to 2016, Johnson (2017) summarized the available indices for measuring global complexity, phrasal complexity, and clausal complexity. Indices of global complexity included mean length of T-unit, T-units/sentence, S-nodes/T-unit, Flesch reading ease, and mean length of Trcu. Indices of phrasal complexity entailed variety of verb forms, mean words preceding the main verb, mean length of clause, coordinate phrases/verb phrase, coordinate phrases/T-unit,complex noun phrases/verb phrase, modifiers/NP, Periphrastic phrases/T-unit and Noun phrases/100 words. Indices of clausal complexity incorporated clause/T-unit sub-clauses/clause, dependent clauses/clause,s-nodes/clause, adjective DC/T-unit, nominl DC/T-unit, adverbial DC/T-unit, finite dependent clauses/T-unit, non-finite elements/T-unit, and clauses/TTCU.

The granularity of these aforementioned metrics was criticized for the lack of information about the development of specific structures. Norris and Ortega (2009) rcommended that multiple fine-grained measures be employed to capture the full picture of syntactic complexity in interlanguage production. In order to address this issue, Kyle and Crossley (2018) proposed fine-grained metrics of clausal and phrasal complexity, listed as the following: adjective complement, adverb modifie, adverbial lause, agent auxiliary verb, bare noun phrase temporal modifir, clausal complement, clausal cordination, clausal prepositional complement, clausl subject, conjunction, direct object discourse marker, existentil "there, indirect object, modl auiliary, negation, nominl complement nominal subject open clausal complement, parataxis, passive auiliary verb, passv clausal subject, passive nominal subject, phrasal verb particle, prepositional modifier, subordinating conjunctio, and undefined dependent. Compared with lage-grained measures, ine-grained measures of syntactic complexity targeted the more nuanced and elaborated elements involved in single sentences or clauses.

Although plenty of indices for measuring syntactic complexity have been proposed, a reductionist approach has been popular among researchers by focusing on limited indices or one level of syntactic complexity (Bulte & Housen, 2018). Furthermore, cholars have pinpointed that measures of syntactic complexity might be troubled by the distinctnes and redundancy problems (Biber et al., 2020; also e Norris & Ortega, 2009, Ortega, 2012). Moreover, as Ortega (2012) pointed out, few studie have ffered ustificatio for including specific measures for syntactic complexity rather than other measures. Therefore, it is imperative that distinct and non-redundant measure for syntactic complexity should be entailed in the currnt study, allit aforementioned lels should be covered, and the choices of the measures involved should be warranted.

# 2.2. L2 students' development of syntactic complexity

Research on L2 students' development of syntactic complexity writing advances in two strands: Cross-sectional and longitudinal designs. Framed in the cos-sectional design, Lu (2011) investigated college-level EFL students development of syntactic complexity based on the Written English Corpus of Chinese Learners (Wen et al., 2005). He operationalized the participants' proficiency levels as the schools to which the participants were admitted. He found significant diffrences across proficiency levels in th following indices of syntactic complexity: complex nominals per clause, mean length of clause, complex nominal per T-unit, mean length of sentence, mean length of T-unit, coordinate phrase per clause, and coordinate phrase per T-unit. Recently, Jiang et al. (2019) examined sec. ondary EFL writers growth of syntactic complexity in narrative writing across four writing proficiency levels based on aself-developed corpus. They operationalized the participants' writing proficiency as their writing scores, which were asessed employing the rating rubrics of the Preliminary English Test of Cambridge. They found that large-grained indice of syntactic complexity and fine-grained indices concerning subordinate clauses increased as a function of adolescent EFL writers' English writing proficiency, whereas fine-grained indices concerning noun modifiers showed mixed results. Meanwhile, Kuiken and Vedder (2019) scrutinized the development of syntactic complexity across proficiency levels in Dutch, Italian and Spanish as second language writig. They gauged the participants' proficiency levels with references to the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) for Languages, whose proficiency levels ranged from A2 to B1. They focused on such dimensions as overall complexity, coordination, subordination, and phrasal complexity. Their results demonstrated a significant relationship between dimensions of syntactic complexity and proficiency levels for Italian L2 learners rather than other language learners, which might be atributed to the participants language background and typological differences between L2s and L1 involved. Li et al. (2022) found that significant diffrences existed in indices of pre-adjective, post-preposition, and nominal clauses between low- and upper-intermediate EFL learners. These aforementioned cross-sectional studies demonstrated that syntactic complexity indices increased as a function of leaner's growth of L2 proficiency or writing proficiency.

On the other hand, Vyatkina (2012) explored German beginners' development of syntactic complexity at the group and individual levels over four semesters. It was found that leaners followed a general upward trend for most measures of syntactic complexity, although the focal individuals showed variability in their development trajectories. Vyatkina (2013) furthered her tudy by examining two German beginners development of syntactic complexity in a case study. She found that learners formed different developmental profile. Moreover, Bulte and Housen (2014) investigated the development of syntactic complexity of adult ESL leaners participating in a short-term academic English programme. They revealed that learners showed a significant increase in the length of the units at such levels as phrase, clause, sentence, and T-unit, as well a i coordination. Bulte and Housen (2018) further their study by tracking L2 learners' development of syntactic complexity over 19 months. Their analyses indicated that learners followed a regular devel. opment trend at the group lel and followed individualized development paths with high variability. Besides, Crossley and McNamara (2014) found that L2 learners' significant increase in syntactic complexity was related to the time they spent on English learning. Recently, Polat et al. (2020) explored 284 EFL leaners' development of syntactic complexity over three emesters It was found that the participants showed significant growth in 10 indices rather than the other four indices as their proficiency increased. Kyle et al. (2021) examined 9 Dutch-speaking EFL learners' longitudinal development of syntactic complexity over two academic years. Their analyses revealed that the leaners showed sigificant linear increase trends over time in mean length of T-units and dependent clause per clause rather than mean length of clause and complex nominals per clause. Li et al. (2022) explored tertiary EFL learners development of syntactic complexity in argumentative writing over a semester. Their findings showed that the participants increased nominal complexity and decreased coordinated clausal complexity, which provided evidence for the hypothesized development stages of syntactic complexity in Biber et al. (2016). These above-mentioned longitudinal studies revealed that certain indices of syntactic complexity exhibited an upward trend as time progressed.

However, the developmental characteristics of syntactic complexity at the group level have not yet ben fully explored because some scholars might neglect to describe it at the group level because of the limited participants, whereas others might hold the homogeneous assumption that allparticipants share a single development trajectory at the group level. That assumption might be contradictory to the possible heterogeneity of development trajectories that might be caused by such learner variables as language aptitude, working memory, age, gender, personality, learning motivation, leaning strategies, learning style, and emotion, and also by such contextual variables as the study program, feedack, time, mode, task demands and so on. As a result, the single development trajectory might aso conceal essential group variability and thus cause us to draw an erroneous conclusion (Andruff et al. 2009). Moreover, the results of these cross-sectional studie reviewed above might suggest that with the increase in their L2 proficiency, L2 learners could develop certain aspects of syntactic complexity in their writing. Hence, it might be significant to explore whether L2 learners with different proficiencies follow the same trajectory in developing syntactic complexity in their writing.

The heterogeneous development trajectories at the group level have been found in social and psychological phenomena, for instance, problem gambling and depression symptoms (Edgerton et al., 2018),trafic crashes (Peng & Lord, 2011), mathematics learning disabilities (Wong e al., 2014), and school bullying (Lam et al., 2015). Therfore, we should take into serious consideation the heterogeneity when studying learners' development of syntactic complexity at the group level. Besides, identifying the heterogeneity of development trajectorie of yntactic complexity at the group level might facilitate us in classfying learners into different cohorts and offering more accurate and targeted interventions to enhance learners' development of syntactic complexity.

To bridge these gaps in the literature, the current study investigates the longitudinal development of EFL students' syntactic complexity at the group level using LCGA. This statistical analysis is chosen over other techniques because it could facilitate us in examining the heterogeneity of FL students development trajectories of syntactic complexity and also exploring the predictive ffect of English proficiency on the optimal latent classes of development trajectories of syntactic complexity. Therefore, the current study is designed to address the following research question:

RQ1. Does EFL students' development of syntactic complexity demonstrate different latent classes?

RQ2. Does English proficiency predict the optimal number of latent classes of EFL students' development trajectories of syntacti. complexity?

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Partipants

A total of 253 college-level EFL learners enrolled in undergraduate programs in Finance, Chinese Language and Literature. Mathematics, and Education at a universty located in Southwestern China were recruited on the principle of voluntary participation after they signed the consent form. Among the participants were 102 males and 151 females, whose ages ranged from 17 to 22 $\scriptstyle ( M = 1 8 . 4 )$ . They uniformly learned Mandarin Chinese as their first language. They started EFL learning at least from Grade 1 in junior high schools at around age 12, having a total of at least ix years EFL learning experience before participating in the current study. Their English proficiency ranged from pre-intermediate to intermediate, measured by the College English Test in China. They were required to write four argumentative essays throughout an academic term as part of the EFL curriculum. A total of 37 participants were removed because one or two of their writing tass were not submitted, and another two were also excluded from stistical analysis due to their misused identification. Altogether, 214 participants were retained as the final, valid cases in the end.

# 3.2. Learner corpus

The learner corpus comprised 1096 argumentative essays written by these 214 EFL learners over four months, where the partic. ipants were required to complete an argumentative writing task every month. A popular online writing platform named Pigai literally translated as rviewing and editing) in China was employed to collect the participants written essays for convenience and to avoid the trouble of transcribing handwritten texts. After their typing skill in English were taken into full onsideration, the participants were asked to complete a given-topic argumentative writing task online within $4 0 \mathrm { { m i n } }$ , which required them to write more than 120 words but no les than 250 words. While completing the writing tasks, they were not allowed to utilize the dictionary or other online reference sources. The writing prompts are shown in Appendix A. Table 1offers the basic profile of the leaner corpus, which includes the total words of the collected essays, their minimum, maximum, means, and standard deviations.

# 3.3. Text analysis

To examine syntactic complexit in the collected essays, we utilized the Tool for the Automatic Analysis of Syntactic Sophistication and Complexity 1.3.8 (TAAssc: Kyle, 2016). Threeaformentioned levels of syntactic complexity were assessed: Global, clause, and phrase. Lu (2011) recommended the fllowing seven measures of syntactic complexity as good indicators of L2 writing development: Complex nominals per clause, mean length of clause, complex nominal per T-unit, mean length of sentence, mean length of T-unit coordinate phrase per clause, and coordinate phrase per T-unit. Among them, two measures, including complex nominal per clause and coordinate phrase per clause, were excluded because they overlapped with two other measures, complex nominal per T-unit and coordinate phrase per T-unit, and we thought that keeping them would be be redundant.

Subordination has been conceived to be a vital means for elaborating syntactic structures for beginner and intermediate learners (Khushik & Huhta, 2019; Norrs & Ortega, 2009) and was examined in the current study fter the participants English proficiency was taken into consideration. Subordination is usually realized in English through three syntactic structures: Complement clauses, adverbial clauses, and relative clauses. The measurements of these types of clauses of coordination were incorporated in the current study. The selected indices for syntactic complexity in the current study are shown in Table 2.

As displayed in Table 2, the current study examined the following measure: overall sentence complexity, overall clause complexity, overallT-unit complexity, subordination, phrasal coordination, noun phrase complexity, adverbial clause, clausal complement, and clausal coordination. Table 2 also describes the manner in which the aforementioned measures are calculated quantitatively.

# 3.4. Statistical analysis

Before carrying out the statistical analysis, we performed the data cleaning. To explore the potentil heterogeneity shown in the development of syntactic complexity in EFL writing, we employed LCGA, which we thought might facilitate us in identifying several potential relationships, for instance, between observed performance and the latent constructs and also between these latent constructs (Schumacker & Lomax, 2015). LCGA models might asign subjects to the unobserved cohorts by "inferring each individual's mem. bership to latent casses from the growth model (Berli et al., 2014, p. 191). Whileall members within the latent clas could share a similar but not identical development trajectory, the members acros latent clases might follow distinctive delopment traectries. Therefore, LCGA could simultaneously identify group heterogeneity and interindividual variation in terms of the development of syntactic complexity, which were visualized in the spaghetti plot. Thus, LCGA was adopted to examine the development trajectory of syntactic complexity (Duncan & Duncan, 1995).

When implementing LCGA, we constructed unconditional and conditional models. On the one hand, unconditional models for syntactic complexity indices were constructed to examine the potential latent classes of their longitudinal growths at the group lel. On the other hand, conditional models were constructed to scrutinize the predictive efect of covariates such as English proficiency on these best-ftte clases. Participants score on College English Tet Band 4 (CT4) in China was collected and employed as a measure of their English proficiency because it i generally employed by China's universities and collges to gauge their students English proficiency (Mear $\scriptstyle 1 = 4 0 2$ $S D { = } 5 0 . 9 6 5$ ). Jin et al. (2022) recommended that the cut-off points for CET4 equivalent to the B1 and B2 level in the CEFR are 388 and 549. Since no participants earned the CET4 scores more than 549, the participants' English proficiency was at and below the CEFR B1 level. Therefore, we employed the critical score of 388 to classfy the participants into two cohorts: the pre-intermediate cohort whose CET4 scores were less than 388 $\mathbf { ( n = 7 5 ) }$ ) and the intermediate one whose CET4 scores were more than (including) 388 $\mathbf { \tilde { n } } = 1 3 9$ . While conducting conditional models, we coded pre-intermediate and intermediate cohorts with 0 and 1, respectively.

We constructed unconditional and conditional models for syntactic complexity indices with the help of Mplus 8.3 (Muthen and Muthen, 2017) and employed the maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors to estimate the parameters of these models. As recommended by Jung and Wickrama (2008), the fllowing estimates were utilized to determine the best-fitted models: Bootstrapped likelihood ratio tes (BLRT), Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test (LMR-LRT), the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the Bayes Information criterion (BIC), the adjusted Bayes Information criterion (aBIC), entropy, proportion, and posterior probability. The critical points for these estimates are shown in Appendix B.

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Descriptive statistics

Table 3 shows that all the selected indices of syntactic complexity experienced curvilinear development trends over the four-month period. AnovA revealed significant differences across four times for all the indices of syntactic complexity.

# 4.2. Latent class growth models

Unconditional models were constructed separately to identify the optimal number of latent class of development trajectories of syntactic complexity indices. For each index, four models were respectively constructed for one, two, three, and four casses. The identification of the best latent class model might be based on the comprehensive consideration of these above mention estimates:

The bold type indicates the optimal categories of latent class for each index.

higher entropy, lower AIC, BIC and aBIC, and the significant $p$ values for LMR and BLRT. Furthermore, it has been contended that the size of the identified classes should be more than 50 cases (Muthen & Muthen, 2000) or $5 \%$ of the sample (Shanahan et al., 2013). The $5 \%$ criterion was followed ater the size of the sample involved was taken into consideration. Only the models where the sizes of allthe detected classes are more than $5 \%$ of the participants are retained; otherwise, the models would be abandoned. The fit information of these models is shown in Table 4.

The statistics in Table 4 reveal that, as for mean length of sentence, the $p$ -value of LMR for the two-class model is significant $\left( p = \right.$ 0.004) rather than those for three-class and four-class models $( p _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - 3 } } = 0 . 2 2 7$ $p _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - } 4 } = 0 . 1 2 0 \AA$ . Meanwhile, the entropy for the twoclass model is higher than those for the three-class and four-class models $( { \mathrm { e n t r o p y } } _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - 2 } } = 0 . 9 5 3 > { \mathrm { e n t r o p y } } _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - 3 } } = 0 . 9 0 6$ entropyclass- 2 $= 0 . 9 5 3 > \mathrm { e n t r o p y } _ { \mathrm { c l a s s } - 4 } = 0 . 9 2 4 )$ , indicating the two-class model is more accurate than other models. Furthermore, the class sizes in the two-class model were all more than the cut-off point of $5 \%$ as illustrated in Table 4. Therefore, the two-class model of mean length of sentences fitted well with the collected data.

In terms of the mean length of T-unit, the $p$ -value for LMR for the two-class model is significant $\left( \boldsymbol { p } = 0 . 0 2 3 \right)$ rather than those for the three-class model $( p = 0 . 0 8 0 )$ . Besides, the entropy for the two-class model was larger than that of the three-class one (entropyclass-2 $= 0 . 9 8 8 > \mathrm { e n t r o p y } _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - 3 } } = 0 . 9 4 6$ . Although the two-class model demonstrated good statistical performance, the size of a class was $3 . 7 3 8 \%$ of the participants and thus lessthan the cut-off point. Therefore, the one-class model was selected for the mean length of Tunit.

As regards the mean length of clauses, the $p$ values for LMR for the two-class model and the four-class model are significant (Pelass1 $= 0 . 0 0 1$ 3 $p _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - } 4 } = 0 . 0 4 3 $ rather than those for three-class model $_ { ( p = 0 . 1 9 4 ) }$ . Furthermore, the entropy for the two-class model was larger than those for the three- and four-class ones $( \mathrm { e n t r o p y } _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - 2 } } = 0 . 9 8 7 > \mathrm { e n t r o p y } _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - 3 } } = 0 . 6 4 1$ entropyclass- 2 $_ { \mathrm { : = } 0 . 9 8 7 > }$ entropyclass-4 $- 0 . 8 5 8 \Upsilon$ . In addition, the class sizes in the two-class model were all more than the cut-off point of $5 \%$ , as shown in Table 4. Therefore, the two-class model for the mean length of clauses fitted well with the collected data.

Regarding dependent clauses per T-unit, the $p$ -value for LMR for the two-class model is significant $( p = 0 . 0 0 2 )$ rather than those for the three-class and four-class models $( p _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - 3 } } = 0 . 4 2 5$ A $p _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - } 4 } = 0 . 2 7 7 .$ . Moreover, the entropy for the two-class model was larger than those for the three-class and four-class models (entropyclass- $_ 2 = 0 . 9 7 5$ >entropyclass $_ { 3 } = 0 . 9 3 6$ , entropyclass- $_ 2 = 0 . 9 7 5 >$ entropyclass-4 $\scriptstyle - 0 . 9 4 8 )$ . Besides, the class sizes in the two-class model were all more than the cut-off point of $5 \%$ , as shown in Table 4. Therefore, the two-class model for finite dependent clauses per T-unit fitted well with the collected data.

As for the coordinate phrase per clause, the $p$ -value for LMR for the three-class models is significant $\left( \boldsymbol { p } = 0 . 0 3 9 \right)$ rather than that for the two-class and four-class models $( p _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - 2 } } = 0 . 0 6 8$ A $\begin{array} { r } { p _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - 4 } } = 0 . 1 2 4 . } \end{array}$ . Moreover, the entropies for two-class, three-class, and four-class models were less than 0.9 and acceptable (entropyclass- $_ { 2 } = 0 . 8 2 0$ , entropyclass $_ { \cdot 3 } = 0 . 8 1 8$ , entropyclass $\scriptstyle \ldots _ { 4 } = 0 . 8 4 0 $ . Besides, the class sizes in the three-class model were all more than the cut-off point of $5 \%$ , as shown in Table 4. Thus, the three-class model for coordinate phrases per clause fitted well with the collected data.

In terms of complex noun phrases per T-unit, the $p$ values for LMR for the two-class and three-class models are significant $\mathrm { ( } p _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - 2 } }$ $= 0 . 0 0 0$ $p _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - 3 } } = 0 . 0 2 4$ rather than that for the four-class model $( p = 0 . 0 5 9 )$ . Furthermore, the entropy for the two-class model was larger than those of the three-class and four-class models (entropyclass-2 $= 0 . 9 9 5$ >entropyclass-3 $= 0 . 9 4 1$ >entropyclass-4 $_ { , = 0 . 9 2 8 ) }$ However, the sizes of certain classes in the aforementioned models were les than the cutoff point. Thus, the one-class model was retained for complex noun phrases per T-unit.

In terms of adverbial clauses per clause, the $p$ -values for LMR for the two-class, three-class, and four-class models were insignificant $( p _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - 2 } } = 0 . 1 4 4$ $p _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - 3 } } = 0 . 3 2 6$ $p _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - } 4 } = 0 . 7 5 9 $ . Furthermore, the entropy for the two-class model was acceptable (entropycass-2 $= 0 . 8 9 6 )$ rather than those for the three- and four-class ones (entropyclass.- $_ { \cdot 3 } = 0 . 7 3 8$ , entropyclass- $_ 4 = 0 . 7 2 4 _ { . }$ . Besides, the class sizes in the two-class model were all more than the cut-off point of $5 \%$ , as shown in Table 4. However, the p value for LMR for the two-class model indicated that the two-class model was not significantly different from the one-class model. Therefore, the one-class model for adverbial clauses per clause was retained.

In terms of clausal coordinating conjunctions per clause, the $p$ -value for LMR for the two-class model is significant $( p = 0 . 0 0 9 )$ rather than that for the three-class model $( p = 0 . 3 0 7 )$ . Although the entropy for the three-class model was larger than that for the twoclass ones $( \mathrm { e n t r o p y } _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - 3 } } = 0 . 9 9 8 > \mathrm { e n t r o p y } _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - 2 } } = 0 . 9 6 2 )$ the size of a class in the three-class model was less than the cut-off point of 5 $\%$ . However, the class sizes in the two-class model were all more than the cut-off point of $5 \%$ , as revealed in Table 4. Therefore, the two-class model for clausal coordinating conjunctions per clause fitted well with the collected data.

In terms of clausal complements per clause, the $p$ -value for LMR for the two-class model was significant $( p = 0 . 0 0 0 )$ rather than those for the three-class and four-class models $( p _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - 3 } } = 0 . 1 1 1$ $p _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - } 4 } = 0 . 3 8 4$ . Furthermore, the entropy for the two-class model was acceptable (entropyclas $_ { 2 } = 0 . 8 8 1 $ rather than those for the three- and four-class ones $( \mathrm { e n t r o p y } _ { \mathrm { c l a s s - 3 } } = 0 . 6 4 4$ entropyclass- $_ { \mathrm { \Omega } \mathrm { { + } } } \mathrm { { = } } 0 . 7 1 8$ Additionally, the class sizes in the two-class model were all more than the cut-off point of $5 \%$ , as demonstrated in Table 4. As a result, the two-class model for clausal complements per clause fitted well with the collected data.

# 1.3. Optimal latent classes of development trajectories of syntactic complexity

The optimal latent classes of development trajectories for syntactic complexity indices were discussed in detail on the basis of the discussion in the above section. For those not showing more than two latent clase f development trajectories, the details of one class were also presented. The intercepts and slopes for the optimal latent classes of syntactic complexity indices are shown in Table 5.

Table 5 shows that two classes were optimal for the development trajectories of the mean length of sentences. Classone included 195 members, accounting for $9 1 . 1 2 1 ~ \%$ of the participants, whereas class two entailed 19 members, accounting for $8 . 7 9 \ \%$ of the participants. The intercepts and slopes in Table 5 reveal that classone started at the low level and experienced a significant decrease rate over the four-month session $\mathrm { \ s l o p e } = - 0 . 6 6 5$ $p = 0 . 0 0 7 $ , while class two started at the relatively higher level and showed an insignificant decrease rate during the same period ( $\mathbf { \dot { s l o p e } = } - 0 . 8 7 1$ $p = 0 . 6 6 4 )$ . Class one was named as a quick decreasing group showing the developmental characteristics of low start and considerable decrease, while class two was entitled as a slow decreasing group characterized by high onset and slight decrease, as demonstrated in ig. 1. This finding might imply that participants i different classes demonstrated general decreasing trends in terms of mean length of sentences but with different rates.

What can be drawn from Table 5 is that there were two latent classes of development trajectories for mean length of clause. Altogether 202 participants belonged to class one, accounting for $9 4 . 3 9 3 \%$ whereas 12 partipants were included in class two, accounting for $5 . 6 0 7 \%$ . The statistics in Table 5 show that class one started at the low level and witnessed a significant increase (slope ${ \mathrm { : = } } 0 . 7 6 6$ $\begin{array} { r } { p = 0 . 0 0 0 \} } \end{array}$ while class two began at the high level and also experienced insignificant decrease $( s \mathrm { l o p e } { = } - 0 . 2 3$ $\pmb { p } = 0 . 5 6 2 )$ . Therefore, class one was named as an quick-increasing group showing low start and relatively quick increase, whil class two was entitled as slow-decreasing group characterized by high onset and slight decrease, as ilustrated in Fig. 2. This result might imply that participants in different classes demonstrated different development trajectories in terms of mean length of clause.

Table 5 demonstrates that two latent classes were also optimal for the development of dependent clauses per T-unit Class one included 196 members, accounting for $9 1 . 5 8 9 \%$ of the participants, whereas class two entailed 18 members, accounting for $8 . 4 1 1 \%$ o1 the participants.

Thus, class one was named a quick-decreasing group showing a low onset and a significant decrease, while class two was entitled a quick-increasing group characterized by a relatively high start and a significant increase.

Fig. 2. Latent classes of development trajectories of mean length of clause

It can be found from Table 5 that there were three classes of development trajectorie for coordinated phrases per clause. There were 169 participants in class one, accounting for $7 8 . 9 7 2 \%$ ; 33 in class two, accounting for $1 5 . 4 2 1 \%$ and 12 in class three, accounting for $5 . 6 0 7 \%$ . The statistics in Table 5 reveal that class one began at the low level and increased significantly (slope ${ \it \Omega } = 0 . 0 1 4$ $\begin{array} { r } { p = 0 . 0 0 4 ) } \end{array}$ class two started at the mediate level and experienced a significant increase (slope ${ \bf : = } 0 . 1 3 1$ $\begin{array} { r } { p = 0 . 0 0 0 \} } \end{array}$ over the four-month period; class three initiated at the high level but decreased insignificantly (slope-0.06, $\begin{array} { r } { p = 0 . 0 8 4 , } \end{array}$ . Compared with class one, class two demonstrated a quicker developmental pace. Thus, class one was labelled as the low-increasing group showing a low start and a significant and relatively slow increase; clas two as the mediat-increasing group demonstrating a mediate onset and significant and quick increase, clas three as the high-decreasing group characterized by a high start and insignificant drops, as demonstrated in Fig. 4. This result might imply that most participants increased coordinated phrases per clause at a significant pace throughout the four. month period, while another small group of participants demonstrated the insignificantly decreasing use of coordinated phrases per clause during the same period.

Table 5 demonstrates that two latent classes were also optimal for the development of clausal coordinating conjunctions per clause. Class one included 198 members, accounting for $9 2 . 5 2 3 \%$ of the participants, whereas class two entailed 16 members, accounting for $7 . 4 7 7 \%$ of the participants. The data in Table 5 indicates that class one initiated at the low level and saw an insignificant level-off over the four-month session (slope $= 0 . 0 0 0$ $\begin{array} { r } { p = 0 . 6 4 1 \mathrm { . } } \end{array}$ , whereas class two began at the high level but decreased significantly (slope $\mathrel { \mathop : } = - 0 . 0 3 5$ $\begin{array} { r } { p = 0 . 0 0 0 \} } \end{array}$ , as shown in Fig. 5. Thus, class one was named a level-off group showing low onset and insignificant level Ooff, while class two was called a quick-decreasing group characterized by a high start and a significant decrease.

Table 5 demonstrates that two latent classes were also optimal for the development of clausal complements per clause. Class one included 194 members, accounting for $9 0 . 6 5 4 \%$ of the participants, whereas class two entailed 20 members, accounting for $9 . 3 4 6 ~ \%$ of the participants. The data in Table 5 indicates that class one initiated at the low level and saw a significant decrease over the fourmonth session $( s \mathrm { l o p e } = - 0 . 0 1 6$ $p = 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { _ { \it } }$ , whereas class two began at the high level and increased insignificantly (slope ${ \it \Omega } = 0 . 0 2 5$ $\pmb { p = 0 . 0 8 4 } )$ , as shown in Fig. 6. Thus, class one was named a low-decreasing group showing a low onset and a significant decrease, while class two was named a high-increasing group characterized by a high start and an insignificant increase.

Only one latent clas of development trajectory was discovered for the following syntactic complexity indices: Mean length of Tunit; complex noun phrases per T-unit; and adverbial clauses per clause. Table 5 reveal that mean length of T-unit and complex noun phrases per T-unit experienced an insignificant increase throughout the four-month session $( \mathrm { s l o p e } { = } 0 . 2 7 8 , p = 0 . 1 9 1$ , for mean length of T-unit; slope $= 0 . 0 3 7$ $p = 0 . 2 2 9$ , for complex noun phrases per T-unit), whereas adverbial clauses per clause saw a slight but insignificant decrease (slc $\mathtt { p e } { = } { - } 0 . 0 0 2$ $p = 0 . 2 6 3 \mathrm { , }$

# 4.4. Predictive effects of English proficiency on optimal classes of development trajectories for syntactic complexity

Based on the unconditional models constructed in the above section, the current study entailed English proficiency as acovariate to examine it predictivenes in identifying optimal latent clases of development trajectories for syntactic complexity indices. Only six syntactic complexity indices were entailed here because their optimal classes of development trajectories were more than one: mean length of sentence, mean length of clauses, dependent clauses per T-unit cordinate phrases per clause, clausal coordinating conjunctons per clause, and clausal complements per clause. In constructing the conditional models, we assigned thestablished optimal classes as deendent variables and English proficiency as an independent variable and set clas 1 as a reference clas. The resuts of the

conditional models are shown in Table 6.

The statistics in Table 6 demonstrate that with reference to class one, the membership of class two was not predicted by English proficiency for the following syntactic complexity indices: mean length of sentences $( p = 0 . 6 1 1 )$ ; mean length of clause $( p = 0 . 5 1 1 )$ dependent clauses per T-unit $( p = 0 . 4 1 1 )$ , clausal coordinating conjuntions per clause $( p = 0 . 6 1 1 $ , and clausal complements per clause $( p = 0 . 1 8 2 )$ . Likewise the membership of clastwo and clas three in coordinated phrases per clause was also not predicted by English proficiency (Pclas $\scriptstyle \mathtt { s } 2 = 0 . 6 8 2$ $p _ { \mathrm { c l a s s \ 3 } } { = } 0 . 1 2 8$

# 5. Discussion and implications

The current study was designed to explore the heterogeneity of development trajectories of syntactic complexity in EFL writing at the group level (i, whether thre were diffrent latet clases f deloment trajectories of sytactic complexit and the predictive effect of English proficiency on the optimal latent clas of thee development raectorie. The reults of LG revald that different latent clases of development trajecories existed in the following six indices of syntactic complexity: Mean length of sentences, mean length of clauses, dependent clauses per T-unit, clausal complements per clause, clausal coordinating conjunctions per clause, and coordinate phrases per clause. Speificall, the first five indices showed two latent clsses of development trajectories, whil the last one demonstrated three latent lasses of developmental trajecories. Besides, the results of unconditional models of LCGA also indcated that the remaining three indices of syntactic complexity demonstrated only one latent classof development trajectory: mean length of T-unit, complex noun phrases per T-unit, and adverbial clauses per clause. Additionally, the results of conditional models of LCGA revealed that English proficiency did not predict the membership of the second and/or third latent clas of development trajectories of the aforementioned six indices of syntactic complexity.

The findings of the current study contributed to our understanding of the characteristics of the development trajectorie of syntactic complexity in EFL writing at the group level. The results of unconditional models proved that the assumed heterogeneity of devel. opment trajectories f syntactic complexity at the group level occurred in six indices, such as mean length of sentences, mean length of clauses, dependent clauses per T-unit, clausal complements per clause, clausal coordinating conjunctions per clause, and coordinate phrase per clause. Diffrent latent classe of development trajectories of the above-mentioned indice of syntactic complexity were in great contrast to the general developmental trends of syntactic complexity described in previous studies (e.g., Bulte & Housen, 2014, 2018; Kyle et a., 2021; Polat et al., 2020; Vyatkina, 2012). General trends of syntactic complexity might conceal significant devel. opmental nuances. For instance, the general curvilinear development trend of mean length of sentences described in the section on descriptive statistics might conceal the fact revealed by LCGA that most participants started at a low level and reduced mean length of sentences considerably throughout the four-month period, whereas a small group of learners intiated at a high level and decreased mean length of sentences insignificantly at the same time. In the same vein, the general curvilinear development trend of mean length of clauses might cover up the fact revealed by LCGA that most learners began at the low level and increased mean length of lauses significantly over the four-month seion, whileasmall cohort of learners started at a high level and demonstrated an insignificant decrease. Besides, the general increasing trend of dependent clauses per T-unit might hide the fact that most participants started at a low level and reduced dependent clauses per T-unit considerably throughout the four-month period, whereas asmall group of leaners initiated at a high level and increased dependent clauses per T-unit insignificantly at the same time.

The findings of different latent classes of developmental trajectorie f ix indices of syntactic complexity might suggest the grouplevel variability in terms of the development of syntactic complexity in EFL writing. Accordingly, it might be complementary to the inter-and intra-individual variability in the development of syntactic complexity in L2 writing, as revealed in the literature (e.g, Vyatkina, 2012; Zhang & Cheng, 2021). In other words, developmental variability in L2 syntactic complexity might ocur not only at

the individual level but also at the group level.

The finding that English proficiency did not predict the membership of the latent classes of development trajectories of syntactic complexity might offer tentative evidence for Ortega's (2012) claim that stated: "afer a certain threshold, L2 proficiency becomes les predictive of L2 writing expertise'. No predictive effect of English proficiency on the membership of the latent clases might be atributed to the granularity of language proficiency classification. The partitioning of L2 proficiency intopre-intermediate and intermediate according to the CEFR scale might be oo rough to show a bettr predictie effect on the membership of these identified latent classes.

Moreover, uncovering the latent class of development trajecories of six aforementioned indices (i.e., mean length of sentences, mean length of clauses, dependent clauses per T-unit, clausal complements per clause, clausal coordinating conjunctions per clause, and coordinate phrase per clause) might imply that these indices could be sensitive to the development of syntactic complexity of pre intermediate and intermediate L2 learners. Besides, these results might also lend support to the development sensitivity of the finegrained indices of syntactic complexity proposed by Kyle and Crossley (2018).

Additionally, this study contributed substantially to our understanding of pre-intermediate and intermediate learners development of syntactic complexity by including two indice for coordination (i., clausal coordinating conjunctions per clause and coordinated phrases per clause) and three indices for subordination (i.e., dependent clauses per T-unit, adverbial clauses per clause, and clausal complements per clause). The group-level variability in allindices of coordination and two indices of subordination revealed by LCGA might offer partial evidence for the oveall development atten ugested by Lu (2011) and Ortega (2015) that L2 learners mainy rely on coordination at the beginner level and make more use of subordination at the intermediate level.

The findings have pedagogical implications. To begin with, the result of different latent classes of development trajectories for syntactic complexity indices might facilitate instructors in employing more accurate and targeted teaching strategies to tackle the specific problems that different groups of learners encountered in developing syntactic complexity in their EFL writing. EFL writing teachers could group students with similar developmental profiles together, and then design intructional materials and tasks that may facilitat different groups growth of different indices of syntactic complexity and provide individualized feedback and support to address learners unique nes and challenges. For instance, teachers should warn students of the harmful effect of decreasing subordination and encourage them to utilize different means to elaborate subordination in their writing, for example, by adding more clausal complements and relative clauses. Besides, teachers should figure out why participants with ifferent onset decreased the mean length of sentences in their writing and propose corresponding feasible solutions to prevent the same problem from happening. In addition, the results of the current study might shed light on tackling the thorny ssue of large class sizes concerning EFL writing instruction in China (You, 2004; Zhang, 2016, 2022; Zhang & Cheng, 2021). Teachers could assgn learners sharing the same development trajectory into the same classor learning group and employ the corresponding teaching interventions to efectively and efficiently enhance their syntactic complexity development in EFL writing.

# 6. Conclusion

The current study was designed to explore the heterogeneity of EFL students development traectories of syntactic complexity by employing LCGAs. The unconditional results of LCGAs revealed that ifferent latent classes of development trajectories existed for six indices of syntactic complexity rather than the remaining indices, which provide partial evidence for the heterogeneity of development trajectories. The unconditional results also indicated that two clases were optimal for development trajectories of mean length of sentences, mean length of clauses, dependent clauses per T-unit, clausal complements per clause, and clausal coordinating conjuntions per clause, whereas three classes were the optimal latent classes of development trjectorie for coordinate phrases per clause. Furthermore, the conditional results of LCGAs have indicated that English proficiency showed no predictive efect on the membership of second and/ or third latent classes of development trajectory.

Admittedly, our study has several limitations that should be noted. Firstly, the learner corpus involved in the current study comprised argumentative esays written by pre-intermediate and intermediate EFL student rather than advanced ones. The results of the current study cannot be generalized to advanced EFL students' development of syntactic complexity or writing in genres other than argumentation. Therefore, it might be recommended that advanced EFL students and such genres as narration and exposition be included in future research. Secondy, this study only involved non-English majors in an EFL context. Thus, future studies might need to include English majors t get a complete landscape of EFL students' syntactic complexity development. Thirdly, the possible effects of topics on syntactic complexity were not contrlled in the current study, and future studies should be framed within the counter. balanced design to control the efect of topics. Fourthly, the current study collected esays written by EFL students over four months Future research should extend the time span to one year or two years to demonstrate more clearly EFL students' development characteristics of syntactic complexity.
