# ABSTRACT

English speaking is considered the most difficult and anxiety-provoking language skill for EFL learners due to lack of access to authentic language use, fear of making mistakes, and peers’ negative comments. With automatic speech recognition and natural language processing, intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) have potential in foreign language interaction applications. Further empirical research is required to validate the usefulness of IPA interactions in improving EFL speaking skills. Therefore, this study investigated the impact of IPAs, especially IPA feedback presentation mode, on adolescent EFL learners’ speaking proficiency. A total of 88 ninth-grade EFL learners were recruited from three intact classes and randomly divided into two experimental groups (i.e., one using Google Home Hub with multimodal feedback and one using Google Home Mini with audio feedback only) and one control group (that interacted with a teacher and peers in a conventional classroom). Both quantitative (English speaking test results) and qualitative data (semi-structured interview responses) were collected and analyzed in the 10-week study. The results revealed that interacting with Google Assistant through Google Home Hub improved the adolescent EFL learners’ speaking proficiency most markedly. Detailed analyses of the participants’ interviews demonstrated that IPA-mediated interaction (1) added variety and enjoyment to EFL speaking, (2) expanded exposure to English and learner-centered speaking practice with immediate feedback, (3) offered greater authenticity and flexibility in interactions, and (4) encouraged peer collaboration. Furthermore, multimodal presentation of IPA feedback was superior to single-mode presentation in enhancing EFL speaking proficiency. The narration, on-screen text, and graphics were crucial to the EFL learners’ successful interaction with the IPA.

# 1.  Introduction

Speaking is often considered the most difficult and anxiety-provoking language skill for English as a foreign language (EFL) learners for several reasons including limited exposure, few opportunities to use the target language, fear of making mistakes, lack of confidence, peer pressure, and low English proficiency (Bashori et  al., 2020; Dizon, 2020). Furthermore, in large classes, attending to each learner’s speaking performance is both laborious and time consuming for teachers. Thus, promoting EFL learners’ speaking proficiency remains an enduring challenge for many EFL instructors (Peng, 2019).

With the advancement of digital media and communication technologies, EFL learners practice English by using a range of digital tools such as intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) including Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, and Google Assistant (GA). With the support of natural language processing (NLP) and automatic speech recognition (ASR), IPAs present a new research agenda with the potential to critically influence second (L2) or foreign language verbal interactions (Lee & Drajati, 2019) by offering learners increased opportunities for input exposure and output practice in a stress-free environment (Tai & Chen, 2020). This allows for more focused personalized instruction and individualized feedback (Moussalli & Cardoso, 2020) and encourages self-directed learning (Istrate, 2019).

Despite this optimistic outlook, as Dizon (2020) noted, IPAs in language education are not yet a fully-fledged field of research. Although some studies have investigated the use of IPAs for speaking practice, those studies were exploratory, limited in scope, and had small sample sizes, providing subjective views on the potential of IPAs rather than a careful assessment of linguistic improvements (Bibauw et  al., 2019). This suggests that further investigation of the application of IPA technology to improve L2 speaking proficiency is warranted. In addition, recent advances in IPA technology have resulted in the emergence of numerous IPA platforms. Coverage, functionality, and media presentation modes vary among devices and assistants. According to Mayer (2017), multimedia helps learners learn but distinct presentation modes affect learners’ cognitive loads differently. People learn more effectively from the combination of words (e.g., narration or on-screen text) and pictures (e.g., photos, animation, or video) than from words alone. However, the concept of “the more, the better” has been challenged, with some authors reporting a redundancy effect in which repeated multimedia messages, cause extraneous cognitive load and thus hinder learning (Sweller, 2005; Sweller et  al., 2011). Therefore, to exploit these device platforms effectively, identifying the appropriate presentation mode of IPA responses or feedback for L2 speakers has become imperative.

Therefore, the present study investigated the impact of the GA on adolescent EFL learners’ speaking proficiency. Furthermore, to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the role of IPA feedback presentation mode in promoting EFL speaking proficiency, this study also explored EFL learners’ interactive experience with GA when using two types of GA smart speakers: Google Home Hub with multimodal, screen-based feedback and Google Home Mini with audio feedback.

# 2.  Literature review

# 2.1.  IPAs for L2 learning

The technological advancements in ASR and NLP have opened up an attractive and convenient new arena for language learning. Particularly, IPAs offer potential advantages in L2 learning (Moussalli & Cardoso, 2020). IPAs refer to the voice-activated services triggered by a smart speaker (e.g., Apple HomePad, Amazon Echo, and Google Home) that can perform concierge-type tasks or provide information on the basis of user input, location awareness, and the ability to access information from a range of online sources.

IPA-assisted language learning has its foundations in the interactionist approach (Carhill-Poza & Chen, 2020; Long, 1996, 2017). Interactionist theory emphasizes the importance of interaction in L2 learning, indicating three benefits: (1) obtaining enhanced input, (2) opportunities for negotiation of meaning, and (3) directing attention to the linguistic form. Interaction generally refers to an interpersonal activity among two or more people. Chapelle (2005) suggests that interaction should also encompass the exchange between people and computers. Accordingly, IPAs are an ostensibly promising tool for L2 learning because they satisfied the four constructs of the interaction hypothesis: input, interaction, feedback, and output (Gass & Mackey, 2015). For example, IPAs offer opportunities for English language learners to interact with the given device and directs learners’ to gaps in their linguistic knowledge by delivering immediate feedback (Tai & Chen, 2020), particularly in response to learners’ pronunciation (Moussalli & Cardoso, 2020), vocabulary (Istrate, 2019), and speaking (Dizon, 2020). In addition, IPAs enable learners to practice their speaking skills in a low stress environment, thereby yielding more speaking opportunities (Sandeep, 2019). Hence, the specific features of IPAs offer great potential for L2 learning.

# 2.2.  Target IPA and smart speakers: GA on google home hub and google home mini

Driven by recent advances in IPA technology, numerous IPA platforms have emerged, each with varying functionality. Differentiating these tools across device platforms is crucial, because they may provide supportive interaction differently. For example, in the present study, learners could interact with GA through two types of smart speakers: Google Home Hub or Google Home Mini. Google Home Hub is akin to a 7-inch tablet with inbuilt GA voice-control, providing an on-screen display of content, including text, pictures, and videos accompanied by narration. Google Home Hub also offers YouTube access. By contrast, Google Home Mini has a different presentation mode and only provides audio feedback (despite presenting content identical to that of Google Home Hub).

According to the multimedia principle of Mayer (2017), people learn more effectively from (spoken or written) words and (static or dynamic) images than from words alone because both auditory and visual channels are activated and they can achieve superior understanding when they interact with both words and images. This is termed the modality effect in cognitive load theory (Sweller, 2005). Although this modality effect highlights the advantages of stimuli through multiple channels, it has been challenged by proponents of the redundancy effect, which occurs when repeated or unnecessary multimedia messages are introduced into learners’ working memory, causing extraneous cognitive load and thus interfering with learning (Sweller et  al., 2011). Hence, Sweller (2005) proposed the expertise reversal effect, wherein information that is redundant in one circumstance may be essential in another; accordingly, information that is redundant for skilled learners may be essential for novices. To exploit the potential of IPA platforms, identifying the appropriate media presentation mode for IPA responses or feedback to L2 learners has become imperative.

# 2.3.  IPA-assisted language learning research

IPAs fascinate L2 researchers due to their promise as L2 learning tools. For example, Moussalli and Cardoso (2016) conducted a pioneering study to examine the use of Amazon Echo and its companion IPA, Alexa, among four adult ESL learners. The learners employed myriad commands and questions to interact with Alexa, reporting that speaking with Alexa was enjoyable. The learners further commented that Alexa could be a useful tool for developing pronunciation and vocabulary; however, some learners indicated that they encountered difficulties in being understood by Alexa. Similarly, Istrate (2019) noted that IPAs (e.g., GA) become virtual peers that can instantaneously retrieve and deliver a large amount of personalized information for EFL learners. Furthermore, IPAs could foster learners’ self-learning and improve their English pronunciation and vocabulary.

To more thoroughly understand the extent to which IPAs understand and are understood by L2 learners, Moussalli and Cardoso (2020) examined Alexa’s ability to recognize the accented speech of 11 adult ESL learners. They conducted a survey to determine the learners’ perceptions of the level of mutual understanding among themselves and Alexa. The results revealed that the learners felt they could understand and be understood by Alexa despite some problems for Alexa in comprehending the ESL learners’ speech. Furthermore, serving as a virtual peer to instantly retrieve and provide personalized responses, IPAs could foster learners’ personalized, self-directed learning and increase learning motivation.

Apart from pronunciation and vocabulary, L2 speaking has also been improved by IPAs in some studies. For example, Kessler (2018) highlighted ASR in IPAs, which provides language learners with ample opportunities to practice speaking, engaging them in various forms of interaction and developing their communicative competence. Dizon (2020) investigated the effects of Alexa interactions on EFL learners’ listening and speaking development, recruiting 13 adult EFL learners who underwent a 10-week program of weekly interaction with Alexa for 12 minutes. The results revealed that EFL learners with IPA made significantly more gains in their speaking proficiency than those without IPA. No significant differences were observed in the two groups’ listening skill development.

In addition to L2 learning, the affective domain is benefited by IPA interaction. For example, Underwood (2017) explored 11 primary-school-aged EFL learners’ perceptions about IPAs (e.g., Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri) and discovered that the learners viewed IPA-based interaction positively, participated actively, and spoke more English when using IPAs in group work, compared with during typical class work. Furthermore, Sandeep (2019) reported that Alexa was helpful for ESL learners because it was viewed as a nonthreatening conversation partner. The learners felt less nervous when talking to Alexa than when having conversations with real people. The learner-centered interaction reduced the inhibition and enhanced the communicative confidence of the learners. Similarly, Tai and Chen (2020) investigated the potential of GA for developing adolescent EFL learners’ willingness to communicate (WTC). A total of 112 recruited eighth-grade EFL learners underwent a 2-week program of interaction with GA for 45 minutes every day. The findings indicated that IPA interaction provided a less threatening language practice environment in which EFL learners displayed higher levels of engagement, motivation, confidence, and, in turn, WTC in English.

The literature reviewed in this paper suggests that IPAs are an attractive alternative to traditional language learning techniques because they help overcome many limitations and obstacles presented in face-to-face EFL classrooms, such as lack of language use opportunities, individualized learning, feedback, and interactions. IPAs also have positive impacts on affective factors in L2 learning, such as learner interest and motivation.

However, previous studies on IPA use in L2 learning have entailed several limitations. First, most of the literature has been exploratory, limited in scope, and had small sample sizes (Dizon, 2020), focusing on providing subjective views on the potential of IPAs for language learning rather carefully assessing associated linguistic performance (Bashori et  al., 2020; Lee & Drajati, 2019; Xie et  al., 2021; Zhang & Zou, 2020). Empirical research is required to better assess the efficacy of IPA-assisted language learning (Bibauw et  al., 2019; Dizon, 2020). Second, the dual input of spoken messages and simultaneous on-screen transcriptions of the IPA-learner interaction has been controversial due to the risk of excessive cognitive load. For example, Wu et  al. (2020) compared IPA experiences across devices among native and non-native English speakers. The participants took turns interacting with GA by using a smartphone with audio and visual feedback and a smart speaker with audio feedback. The results revealed that ESL speakers found the visual feedback provided by the smartphone crucial in supporting their interaction, helping them comprehend and query information. By contrast, the native English speakers deemed audio-only feedback sufficient, noting that the on-screen information interrupted their interaction with GA. Accordingly, further research is required to determine the effects of the media presentation mode of IPA feedback on L2 speakers. Third, a review of recent literature reveals that studies that have focused on adolescent EFL learners are underrepresented in IPA-assisted language learning research (Carhill-Poza & Chen, 2020).

Therefore, the present study addressed the gaps in the literature by investigating three foci: (1) the impact of IPAs on adolescent EFL learners’ speaking proficiency, (2) EFL learners’ perception of IPA-assisted English speaking, (3) the effect of IPA feedback media presentation mode on EFL learners’ speaking proficiency. Hence, the following research questions were addressed in this study:

1. Does Google Assistant significantly promote adolescent EFL learners’ speaking proficiency?

2. Does Google Home Mini and Google Home Hub provide different benefits to enhance the adolescent EFL learners’ speaking proficiency?   
3. From the adolescent EFL learners’ perspective, how does Google Assistant facilitate their speaking proficiency?

# 3.  Method

# 3.1.  Research design

The study investigated the impact of IPAs (i.e., GA) on adolescent EFL learners’ speaking proficiency. A total of 88 ninth-grade Taiwanese EFL learners were recruited and participated in a 10-week program involving 45 minutes of interaction with GA twice a week. To gain further insight into the effects of IPA feedback media presentation mode on EFL learners’ speaking proficiency, the participants from three intact classes were randomly divided into three groups (one control group and two experimental groups), namely (1) those who interacted with the GA by using the smart speaker Google Home Hub, with audio and on-screen feedback (GA-Hub group), (2) those who interacted with GA by using the smart speaker Google Home Mini, with audio feedback (GA-Mini group), and (3) those who interacted with the teacher and peers in the conventional classroom (non-GA group). The speaking activities assigned to the three groups were identical.

# 3.2.  Participants

The participants were 88 native Chinese-speaking ninth graders recruited from three classes and taught by the same English teacher at a junior high school in Taiwan. The participants had five regular, 45-minute-long English classes every week. Their English teacher, one of the researchers, noted that many of the students were reticent when communicating in English. The researchers attributed this to fear of making mistakes, low English proficiency, lack of confidence, lack of oral communication, and peer pressure. To determine whether the English proficiency of the three classes significantly differed before the experiment, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to compare the three classes’ academic achievements in five monthly English exams. These data were collected from the official documents provided by the school administration. No significant differences in the monthly English exam scores were noted among the three classes’ $\mathrm { ~ F ~ } = \ . 0 4$ , $p \ : = \ : . 9 6$ , $\boldsymbol \eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 0 \mathrm { , }$ . These statistical results suggested to the researcher that the English proficiency levels of the three classes were similar. The demographic data of the 88 participants are summarized in Table 1.

# 3.3.  GA speaking activities

Forty GA speaking activities (Appendix A) were designed on the basis of two pedagogical objectives. First, the activities fitted the curriculum mandated by Taiwan’s Ministry of Education, providing the participants with opportunities to review the English course material, which included familiar topics related to daily life and engaged learners in tasks and functions such as asking questions, narrating, describing, or expressing opinions. Second, ample opportunities were provided for interactive, individualized, and collaborative practice of English speaking skills such as fluency, accuracy of pronunciation, and appropriateness of lexical use and responses. The participants were assigned two speaking activities for each session. Each speaking activity, in turn, consisted of two parts: an interactive activity selected from the GA can-do list (https://assistant.google. com/explore?hl $\underline { { \underline { { \mathbf { \Pi } } } } }$ en_us) and a written worksheet, as presented in Figure 1. The speaking activities assigned to the GA-Hub and GA-Mini groups were identical, including both learner-learner and learner-device interactions. In the first activity, the participants worked in pairs or groups. The pair- and group-based speaking activities were designed to ensure the classroom remained a communicative space (Carrier, 2017). In the second activity, the participants were required to interact with GA and complete the activity by themselves, allowing for self-paced, individualized interactions. An excerpt from the learners’ interactions with GA by using Google Home Hub with visual screen-based feedback is listed in Table 2 to exemplify the exchanges. The learners who used Google

Home Mini received identical content with a distinct presentation mode (audio feedback only).

The participants in the non-GA group completed similar speaking activities on the same topics as the two GA groups, except they interacted with the teacher and their peers. For example, in the activity Jungle Adventure, a story relay game, the participants were required to role play as adventurers in a jungle and relayed a story with peers. The teacher guided learners through the story, prompting them several times to make choices.

As illustrated in Figure 2, five distinct GA interaction styles were identified from the 40 speaking activities: (1) interviewer (e.g., questioning one participant), (2) narrator (e.g., providing information and asking quiz questions), (3) facilitator (e.g., encouraging learners to converse), (4) interlocutor (e.g., establishing a GA-learner-learner interaction) (Engwall et  al., 2020), and (5) entertainer (e.g., singing or playing music or videos to amuse learners).

The instruments used in this study were GA app as well as Google Home Hub and Google Home Mini, speaking tests, and interviews.

# 3.4.  1. Learning devices

In this study, GA, an IPA developed by Google, and its associated smart speakers, Google Home Hub and Google Home Mini, were employed as the learning devices to enhance EFL learners’ speaking proficiency.

GA was selected for this inquiry due to its accessibility and practicability. Furthermore, GA can interact with learners on the basis of human-like communication and includes both NLP and ASR. It can recognize voice profiles for distinct individuals; hence, GA can identify who is talking to it, understand context, and tailor its responses accordingly.

# 3.4.2.  Speaking assessment

A pretest (Appendix B) and a posttest (Appendix C) were used to assess the participants’ English speaking abilities before and after the experiment, respectively. The tests were developed by one of the researchers in accordance with the General English Proficiency Test (GEPT) guidelines at the elementary level, which equated to an A2 English level in the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). As showed in Table 3, the speaking test contained three parts: (1) reading a conversation, (2) answering pre-recorded questions, and (3) describing a picture, which was aimed to assess the EFL learners’ speaking proficiency in fluency, pronunciation, accuracy, and appropriateness of grammar and lexical use. Furthermore, the speaking tests assessed the learners’ ability to narrate, describe, express opinions, ask questions, and respond appropriately. Therefore, the speaking test reflected the objectives of the GA speaking activities and the component skills and areas which the speaking practice included. The pretest items were the same as those of the posttest, but ordered differently. The GEPT developed by the Language Training and Testing Center, is used to assess English learners at all levels in Taiwan. The test corresponds to Taiwan’s English education framework, meets the specific needs of English learners for self-assessment, and provides schools with a reference for evaluating the English proficiency levels of their students.

A speaking proficiency rubric adapted from the GEPT elementary-level speaking test rating scale (Appendix D) was used to code the participants’ level of oral presentation. The rubric allows evaluation of speaking proficiency in two dimensions: (1) pronunciation, intonation, and fluency (parts I, II, and III) and (2) accuracy and appropriateness of grammar and lexical use (parts II and III). Each part of the speaking test was scored on a 5-point scale, and a full score was 15. The results from both the speaking pre- and post-tests were coded blindly by two assessors, one non-native and one native English-speaking EFL teacher. At first, the two EFL teachers graded 10 recorded oral presentations separately. The inter-rater reliability was 0.87. The raters then graded the rest of the presentations separately and average ratings were calculated for data analysis.

# 3.4.3.  Semi-structured interviews

This study explored how students perceived GA so the semi-structured interviews were conducted with the 60 experimental-group participants individually to obtain more in-depth insights into their perceptions of the GA-mediated English speaking activities and their experiences with Google Home Hub and Google Home Mini (Appendix D). The participants were interviewed in Mandarin Chinese (L1). The duration of each interview was approximately $1 0 { - } 1 5 \operatorname* { m i n }$ , depending on the amount of detail each participant was willing to provide. All interviews were audio recorded with the permission of the interviewees and then transcribed verbatim for analysis.

# 3.5.  Data analysis

A mixed research design was adopted in this study in which both qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analyzed. The process provided the researchers with rich information from multiple resources and perspectives (Creswell & Creswell, 2018), leading to a more thorough understanding of the impact of IPAs on EFL learners’ speaking proficiency. The participants’ performance on the speaking pretest and posttest were analyzed using a two-way mixed-design ANOVA (groups: GA-Hub, GA-Mini, and non-GA; test: pre- vs. posttest). A repeated-measures one-way ANOVA was further conducted, followed by Scheffe’s post-hoc tests to examine the within-group differences. A three-phase thematic analysis was adopted to interpret the interview data. First, the transcribed interviews were coded to identify core themes indicating the participants’ perception of GA for EFL speaking skill development. Second, themes with similar content were categorized together and finally received a label encapsulating the shared content. Findings from the interview data were used to triangulate and cross-validate the quantitative results obtained from the questionnaires.

# 3.6.  Procedure

The study was conducted during normal English class hours. Two 45-minute EFL classes were conducted weekly over a ten-week period. As illustrated in Figure 3, 2 weeks prior to the intervention, all the participants were informed of the study objectives and asked to complete both a demographic questionnaire and English speaking pretest. A week before the intervention, one of the researchers led a week-long training and practice program, demonstrating to the GA-Hub group and GA-Mini groups how to interact with GA by using Google Home Hub and Google Home Mini, respectively. A brochure of commands and skills was provided to each experimental group participant to indicate what type of questions or requests could be addressed to GA. Then, the speaking activities were administered to all the participants, who were required to accomplish two speaking activities in each session. The speaking activities assigned to the non-GA group were similar, with identical goals but a different manner of interaction. Following the treatment, all the participants completed a speaking posttest and the GA groups also completed a questionnaire and were interviewed.

# 4.  Results

# 4.1.  Results of speaking proficiency test

Table 4 details the descriptive statistics of the scores of the three groups in the speaking pre- and posttests, and Table 5 summarizes the results of the two-way mixed-design ANOVA. The group effect reached a significant level $\mathrm { F } = 5 . 2 0 $ , $p \ : = \ : . 0 0$ , $\boldsymbol \eta ^ { 2 } = . 1 1 \dot { , }$ , but the time effect did not ( $\mathrm { F } = 1 . 7 1$ , $p = . 2 0$ , $\boldsymbol \eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 2 \mathrm { ) }$ ). A significant interaction effect was observed between the test results and the groups $\mathrm { { \Phi } } ^ { \prime } \mathrm { { F } } = 1 1 . 8 2$ , $p ~ = ~ . 0 0$ , $\boldsymbol { \eta } ^ { 2 } = . 2 2 )$ . Therefore, post hoc analyses of the main effect were conducted to further examine the interaction effect.

One-way ANOVA was conducted to compare the three groups’ results for the speaking pretest and posttest. As presented in Table 6, no significant difference was observed among the three groups in the pretest results $\mathrm { ~ F ~ } = \ . 1 2$ , $p = . 8 9$ , $\boldsymbol \eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 0 )$ . This suggests that the three groups had equivalent EFL speaking abilities before the experiment.

A significant difference in the speaking posttest performance of the three groups was observed $\mathrm { { \Phi } } ^ { \prime } \mathrm { { F } } = 1 8 . 8 2$ , $p \ : = \ : . 0 0$ , $\boldsymbol \eta ^ { 2 } = . 3 1 )$ . The Scheffe post hoc tests revealed that the GA-Hub group had a significantly higher mean score than the GA-Mini $\left( p = . 0 3 \right)$ and non-GA $\left( p = . 0 2 \right)$ groups. However, no significant differences were noted between the GA-Mini and non-GA groups $\left( p \ = \ . 9 8 \right)$ . Finally, a repeated-measures ANOVA was performed to examine the within-group differences in the speaking pre- and posttest results. The results suggested significant differences within the GA-Hub group $\mathrm { { F } } = 2 0 . 3 7$ , $p = . 0 0$ , $\boldsymbol \eta ^ { 2 } = . 4 1 \cdot$ ) but not within the GA-Mini $\mathrm { F } = 1 . 9 4$ , $p = . 1 8$ , $\boldsymbol \eta ^ { 2 } = . 0 6 )$ or non-GA ( $\mathrm { F } = 1 . 2 1 $ , $p = . 2 8$ , $\boldsymbol \eta ^ { 2 } = . 4 3 )$ groups. The GA-Hub group’s speaking proficiency significantly improved over time. By contrast, both the GA-Mini and non-GA groups speaking posttest scores decreased.

# 4.2.  Interviews with the GA-Hub and GA-Mini groups

Table 7 presents the results of the interviews with the two GA groups, on how using GA affected their speaking proficiency. Five major themes emerged through the qualitative data analysis of their interview responses.

# 4.2.1.  Theme 1: ASR sparked interest in EFL speaking

The majority of the participants (GA-Hub: $9 0 . 0 0 \%$ ; GA-Mini: $6 0 . 0 0 \%$ ) reported feeling motivated and excited when engaging in the GA-assisted EFL speaking activities. They particularly liked the ASR, which made the interaction more realistic and prompted the participants to “feel like they were talking with a real foreigner” because “it understood what they said and provided immediate feedback.” This motivated the participants to use English realistically.

Furthermore, interacting according to the myriad roles played by GA was fascinating to them. They liked testing the conversational capability of GA, learning more about it, and asking for information about its technical properties, which added enjoyment and variety to their interactions. Specifically, the GA-Hub group expressed great fascination with the ASR due to its on-screen feedback; demonstrating the consequence of the speech input, one participant mentioned:

Amazing! I see what I am saying (on the screen). GA was a funny, friendly, and supportive… learning partner. It can talk with me like a friend, sing, and play videos. I think…a real person is inside it.

(GA-Hub 91333)

太神奇了!我說什麼, 螢幕就show什麼!它是一個好玩又會幫我的…同學。它像朋友和我聊天, 會唱歌、放影片。我想裡面真的有一個人。

The multimodal presentation of responses (e.g., audio, textual, pictorial, and visual aids) helped learners bridge the missing parts of the listening content and made the GA feedback more comprehensible. In addition, the participants liked to have partners while interacting with GA. They helped each other in comprehending the message and retrieving the correct words. They relied on each other to tackle problems.

# 4.2.2.  Theme 2: GA reduced EFL speaking anxiety

Another key finding was that interacting with GA by using Google Home Hub $\left( 8 3 . 3 3 \% \right)$ and Google Home Mini $( 4 6 . 6 7 \% )$ provoked less anxiety in the participants compared with speaking to the teacher or peers in the conventional classroom. The participants’ anxiety decreased due to the relaxed, friendly, supportive environment associated with GA interactions. They became more comfortable and confident with speaking English. For example, one student (GA-Hub 91329), who did not talk much in English in class before, showed increased participation upon initiating the GA interactions. That student reflected,

I felt nervous when speaking English in class before. My classmates might laugh at my mistakes. But it (GA) corrected my mistakes, providing explicit feedback. It (Google Home Hub) also provided on-screen learning support, such as text, pictures, and videos, which was understandable and helped me answer correctly. Therefore, I felt less nervous.

(GA-Hub 91329)

以前英文課講英文時, 我會緊張, 同學會笑我的錯誤, 可是它會糾正我的錯誤, 隱含在對話裡, 螢幕上會提供一些幫助我了解內容的圖片或文字, 有時候用影片來呈現意思, 我比較容易懂, 回答時也比較正確, 所以我比較不緊張。

Although nearly half of the participants in the GA-Mini group agreed that the GA interactions yielded less anxiety compared with face-to-face interactions, some participants, especially the less proficient learners, mentioned their anxiety in miscommunication with GA because they received only audio feedback. Some struggled with being understood by the ASR system, as one participant complained,

I have no idea where I went wrong. I never knew which words I had mispronounced. All I could do was repetition. After one or two tries, I gave up. In the past, I had been worried about peers’ negative feedback. This time, I was worried about my poor English. I was afraid of not being understood by it (Google Home Mini) and not understanding its English.

(GA-Mini 90907)

我不知道我哪裡錯了!我也不知道哪個字用錯了!我只能重複唸或乾脆放棄。以前我是擔心我的同學取笑, 現在我是擔心我的爛英文, 我怕它不懂我講的英文,我也不懂它講的英文。

# 4.2.3.  Theme 3: GA promoted L2 speaking by expanding communication opportunities

When asked about the effects of the GA interactions on English speaking, the majority of the participants (GA-Hub: $9 3 . 3 3 \%$ ; GA-Mini: $6 0 . 0 0 \%$ ) acknowledged that GA could establish an authentic environment for meaningful communication, provide essential scaffolding and immediate feedback, and offer useful spoken English examples, encouraging the participants to self-correct and practice repeatedly. Thus, their speaking were enhanced, as stated by one participant:

GA can participate in practice endlessly, giving me the chance to try out new language. I learn what, when, and how to use certain words or expressions, which can be applied to real life.

(GA-Mini 90910)

Google很好, 可以陪我不斷的練習英文, 我學會什麼時候用, 怎麼用, 也可應用到日常生活。

In particular, a desire to discover the unknown sparked the GA-Hub group’s interest and fostered autonomous learning. They were motivated to seek additional information on the topic, expanding their vocabulary and increasing speaking opportunities. However, some participants in the GA-Mini group had the opposite experience.

# 4.2.4.  Theme 4: Learners’ preference of collaborative IPA-assisted language learning

Inter-peer cooperation was more prevalent in the GA-Mini $( 7 0 . 0 0 \% )$ group than in the GA-Hub $( 6 6 . 6 7 \% )$ group. For example, when the ASR did not correctly detect what learners were saying or learners did not understand a GA utterance, the learners helped each other, as in the following example:

I had felt embarrassed when speaking English in front of peers before (in the conventional class) because they might laugh at my mistakes. By contrast, I liked having partners when interacting with GA. We could help each other, for example, with comprehending the message, retrieving the correct words, and pronunciation. We also liked sharing the interesting stories or jokes told by GA.

(GA-Mini 90905)

以前講英文的時候, 尤其在同學面前的時候, 我會害羞, 因為我擔心他們會笑我。奇怪, 我跟Google講話時, 我反而希望同學陪我一起和他聊天, 我們可以互相幫忙, 例如:發音、單字。我們也喜歡一起分享Google講的故事或笑話。

# 4.2.5.  Theme 5: Challenges arose from ASR and perceived linguistic limitations

Nevertheless, some participants perceived that communicating in English with GA was difficult (GA-Hub: $2 0 . 0 0 \%$ ; GA-Mini: $5 6 . 6 7 \%$ ). Challenges arose mainly from the ASR system. GA had problems accurately recognizing accented speech. Frustration with having to reproduce queries and retrieve the correct words was common in the GA-Mini group.

Another challenge is because that IPAs were developed for native speakers, the speed of speech and level of vocabulary were difficult for EFL learners, especially those with lower proficiency in the GA-Mini group. Comprehending and responding accurately to the ASR system was challenging, as demonstrated by the following comments:

I cannot fully understand it (Google Home Mini), and therefore I failed to respond effectively. Another difficulty was that I could not say what $I$ wanted to say in English because I did not know the vocabulary. I am not a native speaker, after all.

(GA-Mini 90902)

我沒有完全聽懂他在說什麼, 當然我就無法回答它;我不會用英文表達我要講的意思, 畢竟我不是外國人。

As an EFL learner, I had a hard time figuring out the correct English words sometimes. When I could not quickly finish my sentences, GA assumed that $I$ was finished. Sometimes when I really clearly said what $I$ wanted it to do, it did not react. It was frustrating, you know? It ignored me! It didn’t understand my commands!

(GA-Mini 90926)

因為英文不是我的母語, 單字量有限, 我需要較久時間想一下, 有時候我根本還沒講完, 它就以為我講完了, 有時候我覺得我真的講的很清楚, 要它做什麽, 可是它沒反應, 你知道, 這讓人很挫敗, 它竟然不理我!不懂我的命令!

By contrast, only $2 0 \%$ of participants in the GA-Hub group had problems interacting with Google Home Hub. The multimodal feedback, including on-screen feedback, supported the interaction by enhancing learners’ comprehension, helping them identify errors, modify lexical use, and thus communicate successfully.

To summarize, GA-based interaction was associated with certain conditions and characteristics that provided a low-stress environment, helping learners feel relaxed and willing to communicate. Notably, GA interaction provides opportunities for real and meaningful language use. Nevertheless, challenges arose from the ASR system, which some GA-Mini group participants reported difficulties with. They could not adequately comprehend GA’s feedback, so they failed to accurately respond. Based on the researchers’ observation and learners’ self-reports, in addition to repetition of the problem phrase, abandoning the interaction was a common strategy when they faced miscommunication with GA, which reduced the time they spent on speaking activities and limited speaking practice opportunities.

# 5.  Discussion

The first research question inquired into the impact of GA on EFL learners’ speaking proficiency. The statistical results from the speaking pre- and posttests revealed that the GA-Hub group significantly outperformed the GA-Mini and non-GA groups in speaking proficiency. The GA-Hub group’s speaking performance varied significantly between the pre- and posttest. By contrast, both the GA-Mini and non-GA groups’ speaking posttest scores decreased. Learners who used Google Home Hub exhibited a more prominent improvement in EFL speaking than those who learned using Google Home Mini and interacting with the teacher in the conventional classroom.

The second research question focused on whether Google Home Hub and Google Home Mini provided distinct benefits for EFL learners’ speaking proficiency, which were revealed by the results of statistical analyses. The results are explainable in terms of several factors. First, the multimodal presentation of IPA feedback was superior to single-mode (audio-only) presentation for promoting EFL speaking proficiency. The multimodal feedback supported the GA-Hub group’s interaction, alleviating difficulties in interpreting information while simultaneously helping retain it, which is in accordance with the modality principle of Mayer (2017), which suggests that people learn more effectively in multimedia instruction from words and pictures than from words alone. By contrast, receiving only audio feedback, the GA-Mini group relied upon information that was transient and unfolded in time. Some participants in the GA-Mini group reported that because GA speech was too fast to adequately comprehend, they failed to accurately respond to it. In addition to direct repetition of phrases, abandonment of interactions was a common strategy. The non-GA group tended to use Chinese (L1) or nonverbal communication to continue conversations when they were stuck. Hence, the GA-Mini and non-GA groups received fewer English input and output opportunities than the GA-Hub group. According to Xie et  al. (2021), improvement in oral proficiency is largely associated with the learners’ time investment in speaking the language.

Second, the GA-Hub group benefited from the display of query results as on-screen feedback, which helped them identify reasons for miscommunication and facilitate self-directed learning and correction (Wu et  al., 2020). In particular, their interactions with GA effectively raised their self-confidence and reduced their anxiety about English-language interactions, thus positively affecting their WTC and speaking proficiency (Bibauw et  al., 2019). By contrast, some participants in the GA-Mini group reported that they had processing and retrieval difficulties because they received audio feedback only. When they faced miscommunication with GA, they felt anxious because they had no idea where they had erred. A prior study suggested that such cases yield frustration, disappointment, and technology-related stress (Wu et  al., 2020), which would hinder development of speaking proficiency in learners (Ebadi & Ebadijalal, 2020; Lee et  al., 2019).

Third, providing information through multiple modalities on Google Home Hub helped the GA-Hub group discover considerable information previously unknown to them, which motivated them to seek additional details on the topic of interest. According to Hanzawa (2021), these inquiries into the unknown increase individuals’ vocabulary and enrich the content of their speech.

Notably, the decrease in the GA-Mini group’s posttest scores over time was also larger than that of the non-GA group. The GA-Mini group received audio feedback only. The interview data revealed that some participants from the GA-Mini group had processing and retrieval difficulty because the rate of speech and level of vocabulary were difficult for EFL learners (Wu et  al., 2020). Furthermore, compared with GA-mediated interaction, some participants in the GA-Mini group preferred their past interaction experience with the teacher in the conventional classroom. They mentioned that their teacher would intervene as often as necessary to provide support (e.g., slower speech, greater elaboration and corrective feedback). By contrast, GA could not assist them in this way. Without visual feedback and a teacher’s support, interaction abandonment was a common strategy adopted by the GA-Mini group. Therefore, their speaking posttest scores decreased substantially.

The third research question inquired into the two GA groups’ interactive experience and perception of GA-assisted EFL speaking, with the interview data revealing that those participants regarded the use of GA for English speaking activities as motivating and engaging. They liked the different roles played by GA (i.e., interlocutor, narrator, interviewer, facilitator, and entertainer) and felt as though they were talking with a real foreigner because GA asked different questions and provided answers in myriad forms, which sparked the learners’ interest and helped them obtain sufficient input to ensure that they persisted. These findings supported those of prior research (e.g., Sandeep, 2019; Tai & Chen, 2020), which suggested that IPAs increase the learner motivation and interest essential for L2 communication.

Another noteworthy finding was that the participants exhibited a clear preference for peer collaboration in an IPA-mediated learning environment, which was in line with the findings of Underwood (2017). This inter-peer cooperation was far more prevalent in the two GA groups than in the non-GA group. According to Engwall et  al. (2020), ASR for nonnative speakers in a conversational setting is highly challenging, because learner utterances may contain a substantial amount of errors in pronunciation, vocabulary, and syntax. Therefore, collaborative learning enabled EFL learners to successfully interact with GA. The results were consistent with those of Su and Zou (2020), who observed positive effects of technology-enhanced collaborative learning on students’ language knowledge and affective status. However, some participants, especially those in the GA-Mini group, appeared to have some reservations about the value of GA for English speaking. Challenges arose mainly from the ASR system, GA’s rate of speech, and difficult vocabulary.

The findings of the current study present two implications. First, although previous studies have indicated that the human-machine interactive environment is more relaxed than a conventional classroom setting, reducing anxiety and subsequently promoting communication (e.g., Bashori et  al., 2020; Dizon, 2020; Kessler, 2018; Moussalli & Cardoso, 2020; Sandeep, 2019), in the present study, the results revealed that not all human-machine interactions reduce EFL learners’ anxiety levels and promote speaking proficiency. Instead, the benefits of such interactions depend on the presentation mode of the IPA feedback, which is in accordance with Mayer’s Mayer (2017) modality principle in multimedia instruction. The results highlight that accessing IPAs through screen-based rather than speech-only devices can be useful in supporting EFL speakers. Therefore, catering IPA-based interactions to suit learners’ background and abilities is crucial (Dizon, 2020). This should be considered when designing IPA interactions, which must be catered to learners’ backgrounds and abilities (Dizon, 2020).

Second, the redundancy principle of Mayer (2017) suggest that providing written text on screen is likely to increase cognitive load. However, the present study results revealed that in addition to narration and graphics, the on-screen text provided by Google Home Hub was imperative for the GA-Hub group’s successful interaction with the IPA. One possible explanation is that some multimedia instruction principles have boundary conditions (Mayer, 2017). For example, the redundancy principle can be effective in helping learners handle the task when learners are not native speakers of a language. In the present study, on-screen text display may have provided EFL learners additional opportunities to process and better comprehend the information. In addition, the written text helped learners identify exactly what the ASR system did and did not recognize and localize specific lexical items that caused miscommunication. This helped to pinpoint the boundary conditions in which the redundancy principle can be relevant in IPA-assisted EFL speaking.

# 6.  Conclusion

This study investigated the impact of IPA interaction, particularly the presentation mode of IPA feedback, on adolescent EFL learners’ speaking proficiency. The results demonstrated that interacting with GA via Google Home Hub improved adolescent EFL learners’ speaking proficiency. In general, GA added variety and enjoyment to EFL speaking, expanded exposure to English and learner-centered speaking practice with immediate feedback, and encouraged peer collaborations, which facilitated greater authenticity and flexibility in meaningful interactions. A further examination of the two GA group’s performance revealed the multimodal presentation of IPA feedback is superior to single-mode presentation in promoting EFL speaking proficiency.

From a pedagogical perspective, this study not only endorsed IPA-assisted EFL speaking but also provided a deeper understanding of the impact of IPA feedback presentation modes on EFL learners’ speaking proficiency.

Thus, this study could assist practitioners to make informed decisions on how IPAs should be offered and integrated into EFL speaking curricula.

Nevertheless, this study was limited by its small sample size. To provide more substantial evidence, future studies should be undertaken with larger, more diverse samples. Furthermore, future studies can explore specific ways that IPA feedback and the ASR system can be improved to further enhance EFL speaking skills by taking individual differences (e.g., language proficiency and learning styles) into account. Finally, future research can investigate the development of other language skills with the support of a wider variety of IPAs, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the potentials of IPAs in promoting EFL learners’ overall language learning.
