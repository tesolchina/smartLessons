Marketization   
Promotion

The marketization of all public spheres, including the academic community, and the growing competitiveness to publish papers have led to the increasing importance of promotion in Research Articles (RAs). One realization of promotion in the introduction sections of RAs is the use of value arguments, which are the arguments made to accentuate the importance (value) of the research. The present study explores value arguments in the introduction sections of Applied Linguistics (AL) RAs. To this end, the introduction sections of 30 RAs from several AL journals were selected as the corpus of the study. The forms and functions of value arguments were analyzed using Carter's (2016) framework. The results revealed that writers in the discipline of AL mainly use implicit value arguments - a type of value arguments that tacitly underscore the importance of research - and that different functions have disparate rates of occurrence and tend to appear in relatively predictable places in the introduction sections. It is hoped that the findings of this study could raise awareness about promotion through such arguments in scholarly writing practices.

# 1. Introduction

Marketization is a policy through which public institutions adopt the structures and practices of the market model (Fairclough, 1993). According to Mautner (2015), if organizations and sectors in a society adopt structures and practices usuallyassociated with market-based relationships, society is said to be marketized. He argues that such a phenomenon has been transforming social spheres and practices into markets. These changes have also impacted discourse where \*ways of talking that were originally confined to the commercial world are now commonplace in the public sphere generally - in government and public administration, in education, health care, culture, ports, and many other domains" (Mautner, 2015, p. 1). Aademic discourse has not been an exction. It has been permeated by what Wernick (1991) referred to as promotional culture, which was originally a quintessential feature of markets.

Publishing scientific Research Articles (RAs) has become one of the main criteria by which scholars get promoted in their careers. Therefore, to publish their papers, they need to aract the attention of the other members of a specific disciplinary community. However, the degre of competitivenes to publish articles in top-te journals continues to grow (Hanauer & Englander, 2011; illis & Curry, 2010). In such a situation, scholars need to employ appropriate structural and rhetorical conventions of the related genre and discipline to demonstrate the value of their research and gain acceptance among other members of their professional discourse community (Martin & Perez, 2014).

Promotion is one of the central elements of markets. Since the academic community is also marketized, promotion plays a vital role in this arena. That is why, in a competitive attempt to get the attention and acceptance of the gatekeepers of a specific disciplinary community, scholars use discoursal elements that function to enhance the peceived value of their research (Bhatia, 2005). It has been observed that authors sometimes incorporate a considerable amount of promotional discourse into their writing, which bears a resemblance to products promoted and sold in markets (Bhatia, 1993; Fairclough, 2010; Law & Williams, 1982).

Promotion can take different forms as i can be \*realized through those linguistc choices that eek to change or affect the opinions or behaviors of an audience in terms of positively asessing the research contribution' (Marti & Perez, 2014, p. 1). Based on the literature, it can be realized through evaluation (e.g., Hunston & Thompson, 200, metadiscourse (e.g., Hyland, 2005), and lexicogrammatical features such as self-reference and self-citation (e.g., Afros & Schryer, 2009; Harwo0d, 2005a, 2005b; Hyland, 200, 2005). At times, one may materiaiz it through other rhetorical strategies such as explictly highlighting the positive points and novel contributions of the study to the rlated discipline and anticipating and commenting briefly on the findings in the introduction section (Martin & Perez, 2014).

# 1.1. Promotion in the literature

The introduction section of RAs has been the key place where promotional discourse has been employed "since this section generally entails a great deal of complexity in terms of rhetorical options, among them the possbility of including promotional elements" (Martin & Perez, 2014, p. 2).

In his groundbreaking work, Swales (1990, 2004) introduced a model for the genre structure of RA introduction sections called Create-a-Research-Space (CARS).He identified three moves, with each move having some steps while serving a specific rhetorical function. In Move 1, Establishing a territory', authors situate their work in the related research field mainly by demonstrating their topic's centrality and importance In Move 2, Establishing a niche, writers create space by foregrounding the gaps in the research area to relate their possible new findings and clams to the existing literature. In Move 3, Presenting the present research, writers present their research by stating the purpose of their study and other key features of their study. Table 1 shows the 2004 version of the CARS model.

This model has inspired many research studies to provide more explicit pictures of how introductions of RAs are organized in different social, cultural, and disciplinary contexts (e.g., Burgess, 202; Fredrickson & wales, 1994; Loi, 2010; Martin & Perez, 2014). Promotion has also been investigated in these studies as it i an inherent part of an introduction. For example, Martin and Perez (2014) investigated interdisciplinary and crosscultural ifferences in Move 3of English and Spanish RA introductions in Health Sciences and Humanities/Social Sciences. Their analysis of the two promotional steps (steps 5 and 6) among others revealed that, as far as cross-cultural dierences are concerned, English RA introductions contain a higher degree of promotion than Spanish ones. Regarding interdisciplinary differences, Health Sciences RA introductions have more promotional strategies than those of Humanities/Social Sciences.

Research has shown that different disciplines, even those closely related, differ in the rhetorical choices made by authors to promote their research (Anthony, 199; Nwogu, 1997; Samraj, 2002). In her analysis of two closely related disciplines, namely Conservation Biology and Wildife Behavior, Samraj (2002) found that authors in Conservation Biology incorporate more promotional elements into their introductions.

Promotion has also been investigated in RAs s realized through different rhetorical and structural elements. For example, through various corpus-based analyses, Hyland (2000, 2005) identified various inguistic resources such as self-mentions, boosters, citations fronting of specific moves, etc. These were employed by authors of RAs to foreground the noteworthines, novelty, and uniqueness of their research. In other words, the authors used such devices to promote their studies. Harwood (2005a, 2005b) als identified that first-person pronouns can serve different functions in academic writing, some of which are promotional. In addition to these lexicogrammatical signals, Lindeberg (2004) identified that yntactic constructions such as parallel structures and fronted clauses might also be promotional in academic writing.

Swales' (2004) CARS model sees promotion as an inherent part of an inroduction. Steps 5 and 6 in Move 3 have precise promotional functions. However, this does not mean that promotion is limited to Move 3; it can appear in all parts of the introduction section. The R model was not intilly developed for theanalysi of promotion. Therfore, it may not fully catureall the details of promotional language. Two recent model for investigating promotion are Cialdini's (2009) Theory of Inluence which is based on the construct of persuasion, and Carter's (2016) framework. Utilized in psychology of persuasion in social situations, Cialdini's theory deals with how to persuade people to do certain things such as the techniques (i., what to say) needed in order that customers buy a specific item in a store. This theory has not been deployed to addres research publications to date, and hence was considered less suitable for adoption given the scope of the current study. Carter's framework, on the other hand, further rhetoricizes the CARS model in the realm of research artice, presumably compatible with the research scope of the present study. This framework is explained in detail below.

Carter's (2016) framework is based on the notion of 'value argument'. He defines it using Toulmin's basic argument (Toulmin, 2003; Toumin et al., 1979) containing thee components: a claim, a ground or reason supporting the claim, and a typically unstated warrant on which the claim and the reason are ased. He then defines value caim as something that is important to study" and a alue reason as "a rationale for the claim of importance' (Carter, 2016, p. 6). Als, acording to him, \*the warrant at the foundation of the argument is that anything that meets the standard of value is important t study" (Carter, 2016, p. 6). An example might help better understand these three components. Consider the fllowing sentence, which appears in the introduction section of one of the RAs in our corpus:

# Example 1

In addition to vocabulary breadth knowledge, vocabulary fluency, that is, the speed of access o vocabulary knowledge, has also been shown to be a critical factor that influences leaners' performance in various language skill, including reading, writing, listening, and speaking.

In this example, we can identify each of the three components of an argument:

Warrant: Anything that is a major factor influencing learners' performance is important to study.

Claim: Vocabulary fluency is a critical factor [hence important to study].

Reason: [because it] influences learners' performance in various language skills.

Carter (2016) goes onto differentiate the formal classes and the dferent functions of value aguments. He classies their form into three types bas onthe explicitessf value clams and resons: explicit emi-explict, and implicit. He aoidentifies even functions accompanying value arguments as shown in Table 2.

This framework offers the opportunity for a new perspective. It can provide deeper insights into the topic and complement our knowledge on how authors promote their work and enhance the perceived value of their research for their target readers. Since this framework is used as the model for the present study, further explanation and instances are given in the method section.

# 1.2. Significance and purpose of the study

As already noted, promotion can take different forms, one of which is by explicitly highlighting the study's positive points and novel contributions to the relaed discipline (Martin & Perez, 2014). This kind of promotion i realized in the genre analysis framework of Swales (2004) as two steps in Move 3: announcing principal outcomes and stating the value of the research'. Other scholars such as Hyland (2000, 2005), Harwo0 (2005a, 2005), and Linderg (2004) have looked ati from differn persectie. It sms that there is no single viewpoint providing a comprehensive understanding of how promotion is realized and incorporated into academic writing. Thus, there is a need to investigate this phenomenon from various perspectivesto attain a thorough understanding of th ssue. In the present study, we look at this phenomenon in the introduction sections of Applied Linguistics (AL) RAs from a new perspective introduced by Carter (2016). Since this framework is at an early stage of its introduction and aplication, no studies have been conducted using it to the best of our knowledge. In this study, we investigate promotion in AL RAs using this new framework. Carter (2016) developed the categories of his framework analyzing science RA introductions. In this study, while we analyze value arguments in AL RAs, we also check the applicability of this framework in this discipline.

# 2. Method

# 2.1. Corpus of the study

The present study aimed to analyze formal and functional characteristics of value arguments in the introduction section of AL RAS. To this end, atotal of 30 RA inroductions from several key journals of the disciline with high impact factors covering major domains of research in applied inguistics, namely Jounal of Second Language Writig, Journal of English for Academic Purposes, RELC Jounal. Applied Linguisics, Language Teaching Research, Second Language Research, and Assessng Writing, were selected as the corpus of the study. Since there is no computer software to analyze this feature and we had to do the analysis manuall, we did not include more articles in the corpus to make it manageable. However, studies on similar discoursal features have shown that such corpus sizes and sometimes en smallr corpora can reveal the overal use attern .g., fros & Schryer, 2009; hatia 005; Lindeberg, 2004; Samraj, 2002).

The publication dates of the RAs included in the corpus were from 2011 onwards to acount for the disciplinary practices regarding promotional elements in RAs in recent years. The RAs included in the corpus followed the typical organizational pattern of RAs, namely Inroduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion, so-called IMRaD. The corpus's total word length was 49,950 with a mean length of 165 words per introduction apart from the words appearing in tables, figures, fotnotes, headers, and the direct quotations from other sources appearing in separate paragraphs which were all excluded from the corpus.

# 2.2. Categories of analysis

As mentioned earlier, we drew upon Carter's (2016) framework to analyze the use of value arguments in the introduction sections of AL RAs. His framework has two sets of categories. One is related to the forms of value arguments and the other to their functions. Value arguments can take three forms, namely explicit, semi-explicit, and implicit.

Explicit value arguments use the word important' or a synonym (like essential, critical, promising, etc.) in their claims and because or a synonym (like due to or since) as a marker of reason (Carter, 2016). The following extract taken from the corpus shows an instance of explicit value argument:

# Example 2

Uncovering writers perspectives on and reasons for citing is especiall important when writers are L2 students, because such information may provide pedagogically useful insights into the types of dificulties L2 student writers encounter when writing from sources, as shown by previous research on students' citing practices.

Claim: Uncovering writers' perspectives on and reasons for citing is especially important [to study]

Reason: because such information may provide pedagogically useful insights into the types of difficulties L2 student writers encounter ..

As the following example demonstrates, semi-explicit value argument, on the other hand, have explicit value claims but implici easons (Carter, 2016) denoting that they do not give an explicit reason using 'because' or a synonym.

# Example 3

With this in mind, it is important to establish a general map of the similarites and differences between the needs of different student groups to provide a surer basis on which to build future work in vocabulary planning.

Claim: Establishing a general map of the similarities and differences between the needs of different student groups i important [to study]

Reason: [because it] provides a surer basis for building future work in vocabulary planning.

Finally, in implicit value arguments, both claims and reasons are implicit (Carter, 2016). This requires the readers to infer them from the text, as is evident in example 4. In so doing, Carter suggested that value-laden words defined in Thompson and Hunston's (2000) and Gray and Biber's (2012) studies can be helpful.

# Example 4

Register and contextual differences in writing production have contributed to varying distributions of inguistic features across groups of writers, academic disciplines, and topics/prompts.

Claim: Register and contextual differences in writing production [are important to study]

Reason: [because they] have contributed to varying distributions of linguistic features across groups of writers, academic disciplines, and topics/prompts.

In addition to these formal classes, the following seven value argument functions constitute further analysis categories in this study.

1. Establishing a value context for the research: Value arguments with this function establish a context for the study. This function usually appears in the first sentence or sentences of the introduction.

# Example 5

Making appropriate references to other texts is an essential feature of successful academic writing.

Claim: Making appropriate reference to other texts [is important to study]

Reason: [because it] is an essential feature of successful academic writing.

2. Amplifying the value of the topic of a preceding value statement: Such arguments provide additional support for the importance of the research topic. In the following example, the second sentence performs this function, and the argument whose value it amplifies is in the first sentence:

# Example 6

While feedback is widely seen as potentially one of the most powerful inluences on learning, rated just below direct instruction and students' cognitive abilities (Hattie & Timperley, 2007), this potential often remains unrealized. Certainly, by providing writers with a sense of audience and an undersanding of what readers value in a text, teacher feedback should play an important role in scafflding cognitie development, alerting students to their strengths and weaknesses, and contributing to their acquisition of disciplinary subject matter and writing conventions.

Claim 1: feedback [is important]

Reason: [because it] is widely seen as potentially one of the most powerful influences on learning, rated just below direct in struction and students' cognitive abilities.

Claim 2: teacher feedback [is important]

Reason: [because it] plays an important role in scaffolding cognitive development, alerting students to their strengths and weaknesses, and contributing to their acquisition of disciplinary subject matter and writing conventions.

3. Narrowing the focus of the research by moving from a more general to a more specific value argument: This function is similar to the previous function with only one diffrence; arguments with this function are relatively specific compared to the preceding statement. The following example has two sentences in which the firs one is a general statement and the second one a more specific statement which shows the function in question:

# Example 7

In both L1 and L2 writing models, knowledge pertaining tocontent, form, and process as wellas theoretical language knowledge are essential to produce texts. An important component of this language knowledge, in particular in the language testing literature, is grammatical knowledge because it is seen as indispensable in accomplishing a task in an L2.

Claim 1: knowledge pertaining to content, form, and process as wellas theoretical language knowledge [are important]

Reason: [because they] are essential to produce texts.

Claim 2: An important component of this language knowledge, in particular in the language testing literature, is grammatica knowledge.

Reason: because it is seen as indispensable in accomplishing a task in an L2.

4. Intensifying the importance of a research gap: Arguments preceding the gap foregrounded in a text enhance their significance by arguing that what is known is important but what is missing is also essential. The firs sentence of te fllowing example shows this function:

# Example 8

Studies that elicited writers' perceptions of summary writing and paraphrasing (Chen & Su, 2012; Choy & Lee, 2012; Liao & Tseng, 2010) have identified text comprehension and difficulty rephrasing source text information as potential problems for L2 writers, with word substitution and re-ordering strategies viewed more favorably than syntactic changes (Sun, 2009). Despite the accumulation of evidence that L2 writers experience difficulty summarizing and paraphrasing sentences from source texts, relatively few studies have explored how L2 writers' summaries and textual appropriation skill develop over time in instructional settings.

Claim: Studies that elicited writers' perceptions of summary writing and paraphrasing [are important]

Reason: [because they] have identified text comprehension and difficulty rephrasing source text information as potential problems for L2 writers, with word substitution and re-ordering strategies viewed more favorably than syntactic changes

5. Justifying the importance of a gap: Value arguments with this function occur around the indications of gaps and assert their importance directly by justifying the ned for further research. In the following example, the second clause shows this function:

# Example 9

However, integrated tass have had les reearch attention, and thus, many questions exist about how to interpret scores and the role of source texts in the writing from such tests.

Claim: [it is important that] many questions exist [about integrated tasks]

Reason: [because of the need to know] how to interpret scores and the role of source texts in the writing from such tests.

6. Demonstrating the value of the overal research project: Value arguments with this function focus on the overall research proje. and the value of conducting the research.

# Example 10

We think that research based on two comparable corpora of English and Spanish can yield interesting cros-cultural results.

laim: We think that research based on two comparable corpora of English and Spanish [is important]

Reason: [because it] can yield interesting cross-cultural results.

7. Demonstrating the value of the research findings: Whil arguments with the previous function try to indicate the value of the research project itself there are also arguments in the introduction sections that demonstrate the value of research findings. Ar. guments with this function mainly appear after pointing out principal findings:

# Example 11

If the machine scoring systems are capable of replicating human scores, then this inding provides (a small part of the evidence needed for more rigorous validation of machine scoring.

Claim: this finding [is important]

Reason: [because it] provides (a small) part of the evidence needed for more rigorous validation of machine scoring.

# 2.3. Procedure

In this text-based empirical research, a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was employed. Qualitative analysis was conducted to identify value arguments and their functions as well s the places wherein they occurred in the inroduction sections. Quantitative methods were used in analyzing the distribution of types and functions of value arguments.

We read the article carefully and analyzed them manually. Each introduction was read through closely at least three times to gain? comprehensive understanding of the study and make wellinformed decisions about the kinds of value arguments employed by tht authors.

The introductions were first analyzed to identify the value arguments used by the authors. Then, the types of those arguments regarding their form were determined; and finall, the functions accompanying each of them were identified. Since the introductions were of different lengths, ater enumerating the total number of value arguments, their frequency of occurrence was normalized to a text length of 1000 words. We also calculated the mean occurrence f value arguments for each introduction. Finall, the percentages of value arguments having specific forms and functions were calculated to gain a beter understanding of both formal and functional distributions of value arguments throughout the introduction sections of AL RAs.

In order to ensure the consistency of the coding process,. $2 0 \%$ of the corpus was coded by another researcher who was familiar with discourse and text analysis To this end, the data coding scheme and the key categorie along with their definitions and a few sample extracts were explained to the second rater. Then, both raters worked jointl tocategorize value arguments on a sample paper different from the main corpus. Cases of disagrements mostly onassigning certain functions to the identified value arguments (such as drawing a clear distinction between functions 4 and 5, and functions 6 and 7,see Table 2) and the degre of implicitness were dscussed and resolved. Afterwards, the econd rater was asked to code six randomly selected texts out f the 30 introduction sections independently. The inter-coder reliability was found to be 0.89. In other words, only in $1 1 \%$ of the coding was there a disagreement between the two coders, which sems to be reasonable given the possbly different interpretations one can make on how these categories are relized in the RAs. Since the level of reliability was quite acceptable, the analysis was conducted based on the data obtained from the original coding.

# 3. Results and discussion

In this study, the use of value aruments in the introduction sections of ALRAs were analyzed in tems of their frequency, form, and function. Taking the definition proposed by Carter (2016), we first focused on the frequency of value arguments in the corpus. As shown in Table 3, 302 value arguments have been used in the introduction sections of the 30 RAs under study. On average, six value arguments have been employed in every 1000 words. The mean occurrence of value arguments in each introduction section was found to be 10.

Furthermore all of the inroductions included instances of value arguments. The lowest and highest number of such arguments in an introduction were 2 and 18, respectively.

The high number of value arguments, as shown in Table 3 by raw frequency, frequency per 100 words, and mean per introduction, shows that value arguments can play an important role in the introductions of AL RAs. In fact, without foregrounding the positive points and novel conributions of a study, it i difficul, if not impossible, to attract the attention of the gatekeepers of the disciline given the considerable number of other similar competing papers promoting their strengths through various inguistic and discoursal tools. As Hyland (2005) argues, the ability of writers to construct a credible representation of themselves and their work is a central element of pragmatic competence in modern approaches.In line with this finding, Afros and Schryer (2009) have reported that very few authors present their work straightorwardly to readers with no promotional tenor injected into the text. Therefore, RA authors employ promotional strtegies like value arguments eficiently to position themselves as credible members of a specific disciplinary community.

As discussed earlier, Carter (2016) classfies value arguments into three types in terms of their form: explicit, semi-explicit, and implicit. The analysis f the corpus in this regard yielded interesting results. As Table 4 demonstrates, there is a strong tendency in writers of RAs to use implicit value arguments. As can be sen, 90 percent of the value arguments in the introduction sections were found to be implicit, 7 percent semi-explicit, and only 3 percent explicit.

As discussed above, implicit value arguments mostly rely on the use of value-laden words rather than explicit indicators of mportance i.., the word important and is synonyms) and reson (i.., the word because and is synonyms). A plausible explanation for the remarkably high tendency to use this type of value argument i the impresion that such arguments can make on the audience. When writers discuss the importance of a topic indirectly, and readers themselves infer it importance based on the information and reasons provided, it may serve its purpose more effctively than explicit arguments. Therefore, writers mainly opt for using implicit value arguments and convey the importance of their research topic inside their ideational selctions (Martin & White, 2005). Although these arguments are mostly implicit they till enable writers to expres their real voice nd identity and prevent their texts from being 'uniformly faceless prose' (Hyland, 2002, p. 352).

Value arguments serve different functions. As discussed earlier, Carter (2016) has identified seven functions accompanying value arguments in RA introductions. To find out how value arguments are used for different functions, we conducted a functional analysis on the RA introductions, which is reported in Table 5.

Generally, we can say that function number 5 justifying the importance of a gap) has the highest occurrence compared to the other functions constituting 26 percent of the total value arguments in the corpus. Functions number 1 (establishing a value context for the research), 2 (amplifying the value of the topic of a preceding value statement),4 (intensifying the importance of a research gap), and6 (demonstrating the value of the overall research project) have relatively moderate occurrences, ccounting for 18, 14, 16, and 18 percent of the total value arguments in the corpus, respectively. Less frequent are functions number 3 (narrowing the focus of the research by moving from a more general to a more specific value argument) and 7 (demonstrating the value of the research findings), each of which makes up only 4 percent of the total value arguments. Almost allthe arguments in our corpus occur in singl sentences accompanied by another sentence clarifying the function, as in most of the arguments in Carter's corpus. He found some rare instances in which a claim appeared in one sentence and the reason appeared in a following sentence, but such instances were not found in our corpus. We also found arguments appearing at clause level, but only in very rare cases. The following example from our corpus shows an argument at clause level:

# Example 12

Although such data and related interpretations are important, especially when supported by extensive corpus-based comparison and meta-analysis, the study of multiple profiles of academic texts written by learners may provide a more comprehensive description of the relationship between linguistic distributions and writing quality (Jarvis et al., 2003).

Claim: the study of multiple profiles of academic texts written by learners [is important]

Reason: [because it] may provide a more comprehensive description of the relationship between linguistic distributions and writing quality (Jarvis et al., 2003).

'Justifying the importance of a gap', which is function number in Carter's model, has the highest occurrence in the introduction sections. It seems that writers of AL RAs are mainly concerned with persuading their audience that researching areas that are underexplored but bear important relevance to the field is essential, and the study at hand is worthwhile, as seen in the following excerpt from the corpus:

# Example 13

The above review shows that until now only a few studies on the development and validation of diagnostic tests have been carried out. Clearly there is an urgent need for the study of diagnostic tests focusing on the component skill of speaking in English in China.

Claim: the study of diagnostic tests focusing on the component skill of speaking in English in China [is important]

Reason: [because] Clearly there is an urgent need for [it]

Qualitative analysis revealed that arguments with this function occur in Move 2 of Swales' (1990, 2004) CARS model, that is establishing a niche to prepare the ground for presenting research objectives. A plausible reason for such arguments could be that gap moves are widely seen as necessary to help motivate the research in focus.

Establishing a value context for the research' (function number 1) is one of the functions that had moderate occurrence in the corpus of this study. This function roughly corresponds to the clams of centality in Swales (1990) CARS model. Value arguments with this function generally talk about the research topic as situated in a broader research area:

# Example 14

Because reading plays such a major role in advanced academic writing tasks, educators have become increasingly concerned with the ways in which developing writers atempt to integrate source texts into their writing.

Claim: Educators have become increasingly concerned with the ways in which developing writers attempt to integrate source texts into their writing [important to study]

Reason: Because reading plays such a major role in advanced academic writing tasks.

Qualitative analysis showed that such arguments appear at the very beginning of the introduction sections. However, it is not the only place for such arguments. It was also observed that when writers want to turn to another aspect of the topic in their literature review, they may use a value argument tocreate a contextfor discussing different aspects, as shown in the following example:

# Example 15

In addition to vocabulary breadth knowledge, vocabulary flency, that is the speed of accessto vocabulary knowledge, has also been shown to be a critical factor that influence learners' performance in various language skill, including reading, writing, listening, and speaking.

Claim: In addition to vocabulary breadth knowledge, vocabulary fluency, that is, the speed of aces to vocabulary knowledge [is important]

Reason: because it] has also been shown to be a critical factor that influences learners' performance in various language skils including reading, writing, listening, and speaking.

This example shows that the author is now approaching another dimension of the topic using function number 1. Our analysis showed that out of the total number of value arguments with function number 1, 28 $( 5 1 \% )$ occurred in the first sentences, and 27 $( 4 9 \% )$ in other places. What makes this finding important is that, in 28 articles of the total 30 in our corpus, authors start their introductions with value arguments having this function. This indicates that, with relatively frequent use of such arguments, writers want to assert that itis importan for them to focus on issues that are central, of high value, and relevant to the discipline. This helps them indicate the relation between their research and the ongoing scholarly debates and therey claim \*insider credibility (Hyland 2000, p. 80).

Demonstrating the value of the overall reearch project (function number 6) is another function with moderate occurrence. Value arguments with this function emphasize the value of doing the research. The total number f the arguments having this function was 53, of which 5 instances occurred in the last sentences, 4 in the secondto-last sentences, 43 in diffrent places, and 1 in the first sentences. As seen in example 16, the authors' relatively high number f arguments about the value of their research, rrespective of the place of occurrence, shows that it is important for them to specify the relevance of their proect to the disciline and highlight the usefulness of their study to the field.

# Example 16

The current study aims to contribute to this body of research by providing additional insight into the development of summary writing by L2 English writers at a Thai university.

Claim: The current study [is important]

Reason: [because it] aims to contribute to this body of research by providing additional insight into the development of summary writing by L2 English writers at a Thai university..

This function was more prevalent than function number 7, in which the focus is on specifi findings. This isi line with the results reported by Martin and Perez (2014) as they also found that authors in the introduction of Humanities and Social Science texts tend to focus more on the overall research project than specific findings. Such arguments usuall occur in Move 3 of Swales' (1990, 2004) CARS model.

In a study exploring the structure of research article introductions, Anthony (199) described two criteriarelevant to evaluation of the research': application of the reearch and its novelty. Of the total 53 instance of arguments with function number 6 which is used to demonstrate the value of the research, we found that 34 $( 6 4 \% )$ were used to claim the novelty of the research, 14 $( 2 6 . 5 \% )$ demonstrated the value of the research by pointing to the value of its application, and 5 $( 9 . 5 \% )$ performed both functions. This high number of arguments to claim novelty of the research shows that AL researchers tend to alert their academic community to the uniqueness of their work and seek to perform the role of "novelty producers' (Whitley, 2000, p. 11).

Qualitative analysis ao reeald arelatively differen form of this unction in the intoduction sections. Geerall, the value of the research is promoted based on the potential uses of the possble findings of the study. Nonetheles, a variant form of this function was observed as well though with limited frequency, in which authors rely on the methodology employed in the study to promote their work. More specficall, instead of showing the value based on what the possble findings of the study might bring about, authors sometimes argue for the value of the overall research based on the novelty, appropriateness,comprehensivenes, or validity of the methodology adopted for doing the research. Consider the following example:

# Example 17

Different from Laufer and Nation's, the current study uses ongitudinal data to explore the development of vocabulary breadth knowledge and fluency.

Claim: the current study [is important]

Reason: [because it] uses longitudinal data to explore the development of vocabulary breadth knowledge and fluency.

In this example, using longitudinal data (as opposed to crossectional data) is shown to be methodologically appropriate and important. However, since such arguments sillserve to highlight the value of the overall reearch, we preferred not to consider them as arguments with a different function and kept both variants under the same category.

The third function with moderate occurrence is intensifying the importance of a research gap (function number 4), constituting 16 percent f the total value arguments. In the corpus under study, arguments with this function usually aeared in Move 2 of wales (1990, 2004) model. As Carter (2016) points out, they display a level of contrast between what is known in the literature and the focus of the study at hand. The following extract shows this function:

# Example 18

In the L1 literature, Spivey (1984, 1990) traced this feature with reading-writing integration and found that more competent writers distinguished important and less important source text ideas when selecting content for their writing. In L2 testing, research on these tass has not focused on this isue, and yet the scoring of interated tass points to this sill, as shown below in the descriptor from score Level 4 on the TOEFL iBT integrated task rubric.

Claim: [it is important that] in the L1 literature, Spivey (1984, 1990) traced this feature with reading-writing integration.

Reason: [because she] found that more competent writers distinguished important and less important source text ideas when selecting content for their writing.

This example shows that, by using arguments with this function, writers, first of all,display their familiarity with the literature. Second, what intensifies (enhances) the importance of a gap are the preceding statements about what has been done and what i known about the isue. ince what is known about the isse s important, what is not known about th isue willbe important as well. The writers ofte choose t intensify the gap to remind readers of the serousness f the isue at hand and the value of pursuing this ine of inquiry.

The last function with moderate occurrence in the inroduction of AL RAs is amplifying the value of the topic of a preceding value statement' (function number 2). Similar to Carter's (2016) finding in science RAs, in the present study, as the following example demonstrates, the arguments with this function appeared only in Move 1.

# Example 19

Collaborative writing activities have received increased atention in second language (L2) writing research in recent years fueled by their sound theoretical basis and a body of empirical research that supports their ffectivenessat promoting writing development (see Storch, 2013 for a recent overview). From the perspective of sociocultural theory, collaborative writing tasks can help learners perform beyond their individual abilities through the help of an expert who scaffolds their performance (Vygotsky, 1978).

Claim 1: Collaborative writing activities [are important]

Reason: [because they] have received increased attention in second language (L2) writing research in recent years fueled by their sound theoretical basis and a body of empirical research that supports their effectiveness at promoting writing devel. opment (see Storch, 2013 for a recent overview).

Claim 2: From the perspective of sociocultural theory, collaborative writing tasks [are important]

Reason: [because they] can help learners perform beyond their individual abilities through the help of an expert who scaffolds their performance (Vygotsky, 1978).

Qualitative analysis showed that arguments with function number 2 always directly follow arguments with function number 1, that is establishing a value context for the research', though in some limited cases, there is a distance of one or two sentences between them. When using arguments with this function, authors predominantly use only one argument to amplify the value of a preceding statement; however, there are rare cases in which more than one argument with this function follows a preceding statement I all, the relatively frequent use of arguments with thi function implies that it is important for writers of AL RAs to promote their research by making sure that readers acknowledge that the topic at hand is cental and of great value as its importance has been demonstrated in different contexts.

The two functions with the lowest occurrences in the corpus are narrowing the focus of research by moving from a more general to a more specific value argument (function number 3) and demonstrating the value of the research findings (function number 7), each of them constituting 4 percent of the total number of value arguments. The results showed that narrowing the focus of research' appears only in Move 1. See the following example for this function:

# Example 20

In addition to conceptual challenges and disciplinary variation, L2 writers may experience dificulty incorporating source text information into their own writing because of low reading comprehension skills (Esmaeili, 2002; Plakans, 2009) and limits on their vocabulary knowledge (Baba, 2009). It may be particularly difficult for lower proficiency L2 writers to restate source information without copying entire stretches of words exactly as they appeared in the text i.e, verbatim or exact copying) or making largely superficial, word-level modifications (Cumming, Kantor, Baba, Erdosy, Eouanzoui, & James, 2005; Currie, 1998; Gebril & Plakans, 2009; Johns & Mayes, 1990).

Claim 1: incorporating source text information into writing [is important to study]

Reason: because] L2 writers may experience dfficulty incorporating source text information into their own writing because of low reading comprehension skill (Esmaeili, 2002; Plakans, 2009) and limits on their vocabulary knowledge (Baba, 2009).

Claim 2: restating source information without copying entire stretches of words exactly as they appeared in the text (i., verbatim or exact copying) or making largely superficial, word-level modifications [is important]

Reason: [because] it may be particularly difficult for lower proficiency L2 writers [to do so]

Qualitative analysis showed that arguments having this function mainly follow (not always immediately) arguments with the functions of establishing a value context for the research or amplifying the value of the topic of a preceding statement'. One plausible justificatin for the infrequent use of arguments with this function might be that, as the qualitative analysis showed, reearchers in AL do not begin their introductions with covering very broad areas in the field but mainly try to delimit their research and stick to the point under investgatio from the very begining. As a result, there s littl need to narrow down the topic and argue its value again. Word length limitations set by ever-growing journals in AL and the general expectation that RAs are tightly focused could have contributed to such discursive trends and choices.

Finally, the other function with the lowest ocurrence is demonstrating the value of the research findings (function number 7) Similar to Carter's (2016) finding i his analysis of science RA introductions, arguments with his function in our corpus also appeared at the end of the introductions in Move 3. The following example shows this function:

# Example 21

This paper thus aims to contribute to scholarship in this area by using text-based interviews to elicit the perceptions of in.   
structors as a basis for a more abstract framework to guide their practice.

Claim: This paper [is important]

Reason: because it] contributes to scholarship in this area by using text-based interviews to elicit the perceptions of instructors as a basis for a more abstract framework to guide their practice.

The limited appearance of arguments with this function shows that in AL, writers do not tend to talk about their findings in the introduction section. In our view, this is the established genre of research articles in Social Sciences and Humanities in general and AL in particular. The academic orthodoxy typicall does not allow researchers to present the value of the research findings i introduction sections before seting the scene. This finding lends credence to Martin and Perez's (2014) observation that promotional practice through referring to principal findings is more prealent in Experimental and Health Sciences texts than those of Humanities and Social Sciences.

Apart from the present investigation, the only study addressing value arguments is Carter's study of science RAs. However, t is not possible to fully compare and contrast this study with Carter's mainly because he does not mention the frequency with which each of the functions occurred in his study. This might be due to the fact that his principal aim was to introduce and explain the functions, as his study was the pioneering one in this area.

In sum, the qualitative analysis in this study showed that, although Carter's (2016) framework was initilly developed for the analysis of the introduction sections of science RAs, it can also be applied for the analysis of value arguments in the introduction sections of AL RAs since the definition and classifications match the value arguments employed in this discipline. This study also showed that promotion of research using value arguments is quite prevalent in the introduction sections of AL RA.

Promotion plays a vital role in atracting the attention of the academic community. Therefore, English for Academic Purposes (EAP) learners ned  inase thir awarenes of this sse. While value arments ae maily en inestigtd periphrally as just one of the steps in Move 3 of Swales (1990, 2004) CARS model in previous studies, the present research focused exclusively on value ar. guments using Carter's (2016) recently developed framework to provide deeper insights into their use throughout the introduction section of AL RAs.

# 4. Conclusion

In this study, promotion of RAs through stating the value of the research was investigated. Using Carter's (2016) framework, value arguments in the introduction section of AL RAs were analyzed in terms of their forms and functions. The indings indicated that value arguments are quite prevalent in inroductions, that most of the arguments are implict, and that the arguments are used for different functions with varying frequencies of occurrence. The study focused on value arguments in all moves of the introduction section. The findings of this study in the realm of English for Research Publication Purposes (ERPP) can be valuable for both EAP learners and teachers in applied inguistics. ince publish or perish' policy dominates the academic community to a great extent, many scholars, including AL researchers, continue to exploit promotional language as a vital element in marketization one way or another. EAP learners and novice authors can use the results of this study to better understand the nature of value arguments in RA introductions and increase their awarenes in this respect, which can consequently help them writ hir papers more convincingly. The results of this study can also be helpful for EAP teachers and material developers in designing more effective instructional courses and crafting suitable pedagogical materials on promotion through value arguments in scholarly writing.

While Carter's framework is a comprehensive one for the analysis of promotion, it does not consider the whole range of promo tional elements in academic discourse. For instance, an author may wish to underscore their competence or track record as a researcher. Such cases are classfied as promotional practices, but remain unaccounted for in arter's framework because f it being at an early stag of it introduction and application. Given this further studies are needed to discover or creat more models or fine-tune the existing ones. Another limitatio of this stud is that i focused on just one genre and one discipline to make the data collection and analysis manageable. Further reearch on the use of such arguments i warranted to analyze and compare their use in different genres and disciplines and even across cultures and languages to get a far bettr understanding of this topic in the scholarly publishing industry.
