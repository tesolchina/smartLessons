# 1. Introduction

This paper reports on an investigation into the teaching of junior secondary science through English in Hong Kong, where English is a foreign language for most students. It focuses on teacher discourse in secondary 1 (1; Grade 7) science lessons that were identifiedby both students and the teacher as difficult.

The use of a foreign language for schooling has a long history, as has concern over the challenges it brings (Hong & Basturkmen, 2020; Pun, 2019). In Hong Kong, medium of intruction (Mol) has undergone several changes. Until 198 Hong Kong's schoos could choose their own Mol; English as a medium of instruction (EMI) was increasingly adopted as a route to better English, despite the widespread view that it was detrimental to the learning of non-language subjects (Chan, 2014). Between 1998 and 2010 only schools whose students had a high level of English proficiency (around one in four) were allowed to teach junior secondary in English. Students at Chinese medium schools were then felt to be disadvantaged, and this unpopular policy was modified in 2010 to give schoos greater flexibilit. More schools now use EMI for at least part of the curriculum, with integrated science (IS) the subject most commonly taught in English. However, doubts remain as to the efficacy of EMI for schooling (Chan, 2014; Pun, 2019).

While some level of difficulty is not necessarily unwelcome, students and teachers anecdotally report that EMI science is too demanding. This paper thus aims to identify and explicate examples of difficulty in S1 EMI science lessons in order to help teachers facilitate learning. The emphasis is on the language of the teacher as it is they who "orchestrate' the work of the science lesson Mortimer & Scott 2003 p.1 Hong & Basturkmen, 2020). However, this language i not een as separable from the science content of the lesson: language both construes and is construed by reality, and thus language and content are most productively considered together, rather than as separate entitie Halliday, 1998; Htner, 2019). With this understanding, the rearch i the combined work of education reearchers from the fields of linguistics (author one) and science (author two). Such collaboration is not common in a L2 English context such as Hong Kong. However,it allows the linguistic analysis to be informed by an understanding of the junior science curriculum, thereby enhancing the potential for a positive reception within the science education community.

# 2. Bilingual education research and the role of language

Hong Kong's EMI represents one orientation towards bilingual education. Other manifestations include the European-based CLL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) and Immersion, although there is variation in how all these terms are understood (LI. nares & McCabe, 2020). Although CLIL proects vary greatly in their degre and interpretation of integration, CLIL research typically emphasises the active role of language in learning (Huttner, 2019; Llinares & McCabe, 2020). This greater interest in an integrated role for language has extended beyond Europe (Lo et al., 2020; Pun, 2019). Nevertheles, this paper wil use the term EMI when talking about the research context, as that is the term most commonly used in Hong Kong.

Each content area has its own ways of making meaning. Thus learning disciplinary content requires learning the language of that discipline in order to understand the subject, and also to demonstrat learning. The disciplinary language of science is often alien even to students with English as their 1 (Lemke, 1990; Wellington & Osborne, 2001), and L2 users of English have n additional challenge. Consideration of language in science lessons often focuses on vocabulary and linguistic forms. Vocabulary is important, but semiotic systems at different levels are rquired in ordr t makethe meanings of scondary sciee, and linguistic dificult i not retricted to issues f form (Halliday, 1998; Hong & Basturkmen, 2020; Pun, 2019). The body of semiotic research that has revealed the most about how various school subject construct their meanings is systemic functional linguistics (SFL). Whereas the language and the non-language subject are ofen seen as separate or even in opposition (Chan, 2014; Huttner, 2019; Pun, 2019), SFL views the rela tionship between language and knowledge such as science as dialectical, and is able to explain content in terms of language. Many discipline-specific studies, particularly of written discourse, thus draw on SFL work (Pun, 2019; Rappa & Tang, 2018; Unsworth et al., 2022).

Written text such as coursebooks, worksheet, and student work has a key role in school science for the repository and demon. stration of knowledge. However, the central work of leaning is carried out in the classroom, and more recent functional studies in particular have addressed classroom discourse in subject lenig, incuding in L2 contxts (Lo t al., 2020; inres et al, 2012; Rappa & Tang, 2018). Nevertheles the clssoom is sill underreresented, and researchers continue to emphasis the need for work on the role of spoken discourse (Hong & Basturkmen, 2020; Huttner, 2019; Pun, 2019).

Much of the functional work on spoken, classroom discourse aims to describe the features of language in bilingual education. For example, Llinares et al. (2012), considering both written and spoken language, address a range of subjects and contexts. Chosen to demonstrate the role of language in CLIL, these extracts feature successul exchanges rather than breakdowns of understanding and communication. Other works highlight the advantages of particular teaching strategies. For example, Lo et al. (2020) compare two lessons, one of which provides greater scaffolding for the language of the subject. Rappa and Tang (2018) investigate the use of metadiscourse when teaching students to explain phenomena. Each paper discusses the advantages of the teaching strategy under consideration (scafflding questions and genre-based metadiscourse respectively), but neither of them focuses on the breakdown of student understanding without such strategies.

In contrast, this paper takes problems i student understanding of the subject as central to is investgation. Here the collaboration between educational researchers from science and linguistics is crucial. The science education specialist is able to evaluate students difficulties i terms of what they nedto now atthis stage of the curriculum, hil the linguis can explicate those dficulties i terms of language resources used.

It should also be pointed out that the emphasis on language in science education does not mean language alone is sufficient for learning: classrooms are multimodal, with apparatus, diagrams and other nonverbal media including the teacher's gestures. Each system has its own strengths. For example, images and apparatus can more easily demonstrate spatial relationships; language and flowcharts are able to expressequencing; and language also excels i conveying causal reations (Maxwell-Reid & Lau, 2016; Marquez et l., 2006). While referece will be made to these altnative modalities language, partiularly soken, is the central modality of the science class, and thus will be the main focus for this paper (Marquez et al., 2006; Mortimer & Scott, 2003).

# 3. SFL-based genre for studies of language and content

Within the range of SFL work, considerations of genre have been particularly productive in addressing school subjects (Accurso, 2020; Llinares et al., 2012; Martin & Rose, 2008; Polias, 2016). This genre work has several features that contribute to its usefulness in school-based research.

A first point is the importance given to function: genres can be categorised according to overall purpose, and identified in curricular and other teaching documents, through text labels (for example laboratory reports) or activities (explaining convection, describing wetlands). Purpose and language are not separate, as each genre is construed by predictable staging and linguisic features, that is vocabulary and grammar (Martin & Rose, 2008; Polias, 2016). The entwining of purpose, structure and language allows the analysis of classoom practices and materials, and of how those meanings ae realized in language and ther modalitie. It also enables evaluation of coherence between these aspects: whether materials, structure and language are working to support ateacher's curricular purpose or not. These features of genre willnow be ilustrated for explanation and description, which, along with procedures, are key to the construction of scientific knowledge in school (Pun, 2019; Rappa & Tang, 2018; Rose & Martin, 2008). Of these, explanations in articular provide challenges for teachers and students (Pun, 2019; Unsworth, 1998).

Descriptions (also referred to a reports) answer What i ..?' questions. Organisation is based around features of the entity to be described, for example moving from a physical description of a frog, to its habitat, to food sources and so on. Language typical to descriptions includes the timeles present tense, with relational processes identfying the entit for example, with be, be called) or attributing qualities to it (e.g. 'act as'; seem').

Explanations account for phenomena, answering How?' or Why' questions. They vary depending on the phenomenon, but a prototypical example such as the water cycle involves a temporall ordered sequence, with events also connected causall (Martin & Rose, 2008; Polias, 2016; Unsworth et al., 2022). This explanation sequence can typically be represented by aflowchart: collction . $>$ evaporation - $\cdot >$ condensation - $>$ precipitation etc.

While descriptions and explanations diffr in their organizing principle (groups of features and temporal sequences respectively), they may both include a concluding stage (Martin & Rose, 2008; Unsworth, 1998). Here teachers condense previous material. highlighting points that are most important for students. Conclusions are particularly necessary in the spoken environment of the classrom, where it may be more ifficult for students o identify key points. emke (1990, p. 109 terms these interventions Teacher Summaries", and deems them \*extremely important because they both select and synthesize' the science content (his emphasis). LI. nares et al. (2012, pp. 66-67) provide an example from a geography lesson on signs of development. The teacher draws together student contributions, rewording them into curicular knowledge; she signals this teacher summary with the discourse marker, 'okay, so'.

This example also ilustrates a linguistic feature which greatly facilitates such condensation of meaning: embedding within the nominal group (noun phrase in traditional grammar). The student contributions preceding (1) illutrated in (2), are a series of clauses without embedding. Clause divisions are marked as |.

The teacher synthesizes this and other student ideas. They pack information into the nominal group by embedding a non-finite clause, indicated in (3) with square brackets. By expanding the nominal group in this way, they can use a more complex idea as the departure point (subject) for the message. A complex point can then be made in one clause (3), rather than acros several clauses (2).

the right [to have clean water] is a main issue

This embedding within the nominal group is arelatively simple way of condensing meaning, but i helps provide precision, and is a precursor to more complex nominal expansion and other abstractions (se Halliday, 1998). Such language allows movement along the register continuum between more everyday and more scientific language, and facilitates the meaning making of school science.

It should also be pointed out that genres do not exist in isolation, and combinations of genres are discussed as macrogenres. For example, the commonly used observe-report-explain progresses from doing and observing science, to describing and organizing in formation, to explaining events (Gibbons, 2003; Love, 2009).

SFL-based genre work thus provides perspectives and tools appropriate to the study of student difficulty in science lessons. This paper uses these toos, informed by knowledge of the learning requirements of junior secondary science, to address the following questions.

1. What student dificulties in understanding are identified in junior secondary EMI science lessons in Hong Kong?   
2. How do these difficulties relate to the curricular needs of junior secondary science?   
3. What does SFL-based genre work reveal about these difficulties?

The next section will detail how this research was carried out.

# 4. Methodology

The main focus of this paper is on a sub-set of datafrom a larger project. This section first describes the data collection for the overall project, then the firs stage of analysis that led to the choice f sample lessons for this paper, followed by the more detailed analysis of data for these sample lessons.

# 4.1. Data collection

For the overall project from which his paper derives, data were collected from the secondary one (S1) EMI science clases of three schools, with one participating teacher per chool. Table 1 provides an overview of the chools. In one school (here called East) one class of students participated, while in each of the other two chools there were two partcipating clases. In total, ten lesons of 40-80 min each were observed, videorecorded and transcribed, and materials used were collected.

Bilingual questionnaires in Chinese and English addressing the subject of IS (Integrated Science) generally and also the specific lesson were administered to the students of each class. The questionnaires consisted of closed and open items, and included questions on difficulty, useulness and interes. (The stdent questonaire addressed a range f adtional isues such as learning preferences, but for reasons of space and focus, only the questions on difficulty and understanding will be considered here.) Semi-structured in terviews were carried out with the teachers before and afte each lesson. Before the leson the teacher was asked bout their objecties for the lesson, what they hoped to achieve, and whether they considered it to be arelatively easy or difficult leson for the students. After the lesson, isues discusse included whether the lesson had gone as they expected, whether they had achieved their aims, and whether anything unexpected had occurred.

# 4.2. Initial data analysis leading to the choice of sample lessons

The sample lessons were chosen through analysis of the items on difficulty from the questionnaires plus consideration of the teacher interviews and the observed lessons. The relevant closed items are reproduced, in English onl, as questions 1-3 in Table 2. These were followed by the open question, What was the most dificult part of th lesson? Responses to the closed and open questions were collated to identify lessons that the students considered difficult, and the aspects of those lessons that caused difficulty, respectively.

The videotapes and observation note for the lesons were then considered for any further evidence of difficulty, for example in terms of student answers to questions, student questions, or teacher comments. Finally the teacher interviews were consulted for expressions of difficult or any consideration that might affect the choice of th leson for the paper. From ths process we selected lessons for this paper that both students and teacher identified as diffcult and which included evidence of diffculty in the observed lesson. The following section details the analysis of those selected lessons.

# 4.3. Analysis of the sample lessons

The analysis was carried out by the two authors both jointly and separately, working with video and tapescripts of the lessons, as well as note taken during classroom observation. Insights provided by the science specialist informed linguistic analysis, which was in turn corroborated or further modfied by the cience specilis in a recursive process Much of thi analysis was joint proces, and not easily attributed to one or other researcher. In the following schematic outine joint work is marked (S/L). Aspects led by the science educator or linguist are indicated (S) and (L) respectively. It should be added that this representation makes the process appear more linear than was the case.

. The lessons were related to the science curriculum to establish the learning requirements for this topic (S).   
The clasroom discourse was considered in terms of genre, using the interconnecting considerations of purpose, staging and language, as discused in 3. For example, the presence of aseries of chronologically ordered and causallyconnected events helped identify an explanation. Conclusions - authoritative teacher discourse used to highlight key points, particularly at the end of a discussion - suggested teaching emphasis (L).   
. Teacher discourse was considered in terms of the everyday-scientific continum: whether movement along this continuum allowed the teacher both to communicate with students, and also to develop the students' understanding and expression of the technical meanings of school science (S/L).   
Coherence betwee all these aspects was considered. The analysis of the lessons was compared with the teacher's stated objectives, the textbook and other materials, and the student expressions of difficulty in and out of class (S/L).

# 5. Findings

The findings will be considered under two sections: first the findings on difficulty across the full data set that led to the selection of the sample lesons; second, the findings from the sample lessons, including comments from student questonnaires and teacher interviews, extracts from the lessons and consideration of materials.

# 5.1. Difficulty across the three schools and choice of sample lessons

Responses to the questionnair items 1-3 (Table 2) indicating some difficulty are summarized in Table 3. These closed items gave eneral inaors of iffict crossthe five clse f the verl proect uggsting that Water ws the sst topic, Matter the most challenging, and that for Energy it depended on the class and school. For most lesons other than Water, a considerable proportion of students in each class $( 2 0 \% - 5 2 \% )$ agreed to some extent with the statement I found today's lesson difficult (Q1). A much smaller proportion (zero to $1 6 \%$ ) disagreed with the statement I understood today's lesson (Q2), and very few strongly disagreed (zero to $4 \%$

Table 4. Isues that were only mentioned by one or two students have been excluded, as have small number of ambiguous comments.

The lessons where most students reported some area of difficulty were South's Water and North's Energy lessons. For South's Water, this response can be attributed to the high load of technical vocabulary, and the lesson was not rated as ifficult in the closed items (Table 3).In contrast, North's Energy lesons were difficult for conceptual reasons, and problems were reported in both closed and open items. Furthermore, both teacher and students explicitly referred to dificultie throughout the esons, particularly those that included the motor-generator, 1A(ii) and 1B. These two lessons on energy converson in the motor and the generator were thus selected for further consideration in this paper.

From here on, the Findings will focus solely on the motorgenerator lessons, taught by one teacher to two groups of students, classes 1A (with 29 students) and 1B (32 students) at North schoo (see Table 1). North i a girls schoo i a les afflent area of Hong Kong, and includes some students with Urdu as their frt language. The teacher, here referred to as Hannah, has a science degree, a Postgraduate Diploma in Education for the teaching of science subjects, and studied science in an EMI schol herself. She had ben teaching for approximately five years, always through English.

# 5.2. The motor-generator lessons

The materils used in the motor-generator essons and the corresponding objectives from the science currculum are given frst to provide context for the data. Student difficulties are then presented, with comment from teacher and students, and extracts from the lesons itratin tffiie inthtct intons. lly theti n ert.

The learning objectives for this part of the junior science currculum concern the processes of energy changes or conversion, with the motor and the generator intended as just two examples of convertors (see Currculum Development Council (CDC, 2017, pp. 36-37) for a brief summary of what students are expected to learn for Energy). Hannah designed the apparatus for the leson following the textbook diagram (Chan et al., 2011, p.16), which was displayed on the screen throughout the lesson. The diagram and accompanying text are redrawn as Fig. 1.

# 5.2.1. Expressions of difficulty: teacher and students

Prior to teaching the teacher described the lesson objectives as to teach them energy change and the motor-generator'. fter the 1A lesson, she explained that when previously teaching the topic she initiall thought the students had understood, and then found that they had not, adding, \*this task is too difficult. During the lessons themselves, she also commented on difficult, for example.

<html><body><table><tr><td>(4)</td><td>i. Oh you&#x27;re confused already (1A) ii. Such a long task to explain to you. I know this is really difficult to understand. (1A)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>iii. It&#x27;s difficult to understand but I want you to try ... (1B).</td></tr></table></body></html>

Students expressed difficulty on the questionnaire and in the lesson. The open question, What was the most difficult part of the lesson? elicited some aspect of curricula conten from twelve students in 1Aeson ) and ninet in 1 (Table 4). The most common response (six 1A and nine 1B students) referred to the motor and/or generator, for example (5), fllowed by references to the required curricula focus of the lesson, energy conversion' (five from 1A and four from 1B). Four students from each class addressed the experiment (i.e. the demonstration), for example (6), and one student stated they did not understand the teacher's questioning (7)

<html><body><table><tr><td>(5)</td><td>i. motors, generators (1A)</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>ii. To learn the difference between motors and generators and why. (1B) iii. To understand what motor and generators are. (1B)</td></tr><tr><td>(6)</td><td>i. The experiment (1B)</td></tr><tr><td>(7)</td><td>ii. The experiment is difficult to understand (1A)</td></tr></table></body></html>

A common thread running through many comments, for example (5)ii, 6)ii, and (7), was not being able to understand. This difficulty in understanding also emerged in the classroom discourse.

Student responses during the lessons such as (8) indicated difficulty. (Translations of comments originally in Chinese are italicized in square brackets; the original is omitted for reasons of space.)

# 5.2.2. Unclear objectives

Throughout the motor-generator lesons, the teacher alternated between a focus on proces (explanation of energy changes) and on entity (description of the dual device), with the lattr ften appearing more dominant. Extract 1illustrates the shifting focus.

Extract 1: What is this thing?(1A)

So, and, why-why there&#x27;s su-such a very co-complicated experiment for you?</td></tr></table></body></html>

The teacher works on explaining the energy conversions. In lines 10-12 she outlines the events and actions that have just been observed in a temporal sequence that can be represented as a flow chart: (the weight) free falls . $\cdot >$ unit moves - $>$ electrical energy - $>$ lights up bulb.

The energy conversions involved are also addressed, for example kinetic to electrical energy (line 21). These sections correspond to what students need to learn: how the motor and the generator function in terms of energy conversions.

However, the description of the motor-generator as device is regularly emphasised, with the teacher continuall returning to the dual-purpose nature of the apparatus (lines 1, 18-20 and 28-32). Here the teacher is drawn into describing the components of the motor-generator, with relational proceses dominating: \*it also acts as a generator line 1; also lines 18, 29, 31) \*his unit is clled a generator" (lines 22-23).

Moreover, the teacher's concluding stage presents the ssue as description: the device not the process of energy conversion (lines 28-32). This summing up is signalled by the discourse marker Okay, so', which works to draw student atention and to signal the authoritative version of the lessons content, as in (1). Similarly, when telling students why the lesson is difficult lines 28-29), or answering a student question (line 18), the teacher focuses on the decription of the combined device, despite this not being required for junior secondary cience. Students eventually say they understand (lines 25-27), but it i not clear exactly what they understand here, and subsequent comments such as (8)ii suggest they do not understand.

After highlighting the dual-function device, the teacher asks if students understand (line 4). Here again she seems to emphasise the entity rather than the roceses involved as the learning objective. The extract is ollowed by the student request for extra help sn in 8)il

# 5.2.3. Technical knowledge and the everyday-scientific register continuum

The focus on entity as opposed to proces, as seen in Extrcts 1 and 2, is not the only issue contributing to student confusion. xtract 3, which does address procese of energy conversion, shows the teacher using language at the everyday end of the everyday-scientific register continuum. The language, aided by gestures, may seem accessible, but does not convey the precise scientific meaning required and causes confusion. The teacher aims to elicit an energy conversion, specificall that the motor changes the electrical energy into kinetic energy (lines 20-21). However, her question (line 1) is expressed in terms of location, rom here to here" (gesturing from the battery to the motor). This is interpreted variously by student, leading to diverse answers which apply to diffrent parts of the apparatus (line 2). I alo leads to confusion over how a battery works (lines 6-11), a more complex topic which is not needed for this lesson.

The problem is not solely an issue of dificulty with L2 English, as the teacher moves into Chinese at line 12. It is true that the students' first language can be used as a resource for unpacking the technicality of the target language (Lin & Wu, 2015), but here the questions are no clearer in Chinese, with the teacher eliciting the required answer by asking for the "one before kinetic energy (lines 19-21). Furthermore, the movement between languages is unidirectional; the teacher does not subsequently repack' the point into English, and does not help students with the technical language they need to demonstrae their understanding. However, clasroom L1 use is a complex issue, not leas as the use ofL1 in I lessons is iscouraged r even prohited in Hong Kong (Pun, 2019) The issue is considered more fully in Maxwell-Reid (2017).

# 5.3.Textbook materials

The textbook, Understanding Integrated Science, henceforth UIs (Chan et al., 2011) sets out the experiment (or demonstration) as a procedure, with materias, a diagram combining motor and generator, and numbered steps to follow (Fig.1). Steps 2 and 3 correspond to the demonstration of the dual-function apparatus operating as a motor and as a generator respectively. fter each of these steps, two questions are asked, the first about an empirical observation, the second asking for the energy conversion that explains the observation. Although the text thus follows the observe-report-explain staging (Gibbons, 2003), the task does not work through each event of the two sequences, and there is ittle support for students. Answers to the task address just one event for the motor, \*The weights rise" (question 2 in Fig. 1), and one for the generator, The bulb ights up" (question 3). The specific energy conversion is also asked for, but there is no language or visual representation to help students move between what is observed and the relevant energy conversion.

Comparison with another popular textbook for IS in Hong Kong, MasteringScience (Chan et al., 2010), henceforth Ms, highlights the difficulties with UI. MS demonstrates the motor and the generator separately, and provides considerably more scaffolding in text and other modalities (see Appendix). A flowchart is used for each device, making the forms of energy and the sequence of energy conversions involved in the demonstrations explicit, and highlighting the explanation rather than the procedure. Answers require the observed events (e.g. \*The light bulb lights up", Figure A2), but also completion of the explanation sequence in the flowchart. The students task i to identif the energy conversion occurring at each ste of the sequence y labelling the energy form. For example, the first box in Figure Al i to be completed with \*electrical, and the second box, \*kinetic. The energy conversions are specified using embedding in the nominal group: either a reduced relative clause, for example in italics (9), or a prepositional phrase (underlined) in (10), both from Figure A1. (The answers required of the students are here reproduced in bold.)

# 6. Discussion

This section willconsider the findings in terms of the guiding questions for the study as laid out in Section 3 (RQs 1-3). The first question concerns the idtification of student diffiulties in understanding. The cosed questions on the questionnair found a number of students greeing that there was some difficulty to the esson, with far fwer reporting that they did not understand (Table 3). In the open questions, students were able to specify difficulties (Table 4). Where vocabulary was reported as the main challenge (the Water lesson at South school), it was not associated with lack of understanding (Table 3). I contrast, conceptual ifficulties with curiular content were noted by classes that had not been confident they understood. Examining two of these classes more closely, question. naires and classroom observation suggested that difficulty coincided with lack of clarity in teaching objectives, as will be discussed under the second research question.

The second question related student ifficulties to the requirements of the science curriculum. Here the key finding was a mismatch between the curriculum and the fous of the observed lesons. Students at his stage of their science education are expectedto lean the processes of energy conversion, with the motor and the generator just considered as two examples of conversion (CDC, 2017). However, under the influence of the textbook diagram and questions (Fig. 1), the focus of the observed lessons became the motor-generator itself. The teacher modelled her classoom demonstration on the textbook diagram, and herself expressed the leson objectives as both energy conversion and the dual-function apparatus (5.2.1). The concept of one device acting as either motor or generator, named and described diffrently according to the situation, was the major ostacle for the students, and not necessary for the S1 learning objectives.

The third research question concerns the explication of these difficulties through the lens of SFL-based genre, in terms of purpose, staging and language. Thus the change in focus outlined in RQ2 corresponds to uncertaint asto the main genre: the leson became a description of an entity rather than the required explanation of procese. An explanation can contain decription of elements, and may build up gradually. However, in these lesons the description of the complicated dual-function apparatus led to student misunderstandings as to the main purpose of the lesson. Student questions in classand also questionnaire responses indicate an inter. pretation of the lesson as focusing on an entity (description) rather than processes (explanation): (8)i asks \*What is ths thing?"; ()) suggests students think they need to learn the difference between the two convertors.

Generic structure may be les clear-cut i spoken discourse, making any concluding stage particularly important. Conclusions, with teachers providing the authoritatie school science version of the topic,can be seen in many classoom examples of previous studies (Lemke, 1990; Llinares et al., 2012; Mortimer & Scot, 2003). For example, Mortimer and Scott (2003, p. 54) show a teacher moving from a discussion of individual examples of the process of rusting, to the more general point she wants students to learn.

Conclusions in our data show Hannah emphasising the description of an entit, and drawing student attention to her summary using discourse markers such as okay so (for example extract 1, lines 28-32). She also highlights the apparatus in her checks on student understanding. These teacher interventions may contribute to students' belief that the main learning point of the lesson is a description of the dual-function device, rather than explanation of the conversions.

The third consideration for genre is realization in language. Everyday language such as \*here to here (Extract 3, line 1) may seem easy to understand, but as les precise, contributed to student confusion. A more specific question, \*What form of energy does the battery supply?", is clearer. I also takes the form of a clause which can be embedded to expres the energy conversions as seen in (9) and Figure A1, and thus provides more language support for the students.

Altenative strategie fr asting understanding, such as gestures or referring t relative order,can be usefull employed in spoken discourse to direct attention and negotiate meaning respectively. However, the gesture used in Extract 3, line 1 suggested a location range, which does not help with the relevant question on energy conversion in the motor. Nor can relative order (Extract 3, lines 19-21) be generalized to a source of the energy conversion, as can the more technical language of MS in (9) and (10). The MS language is more complex, but the grammar enables the specific meanings of the energy conversion, which is the learning point of th lesson.

This paper focuses on difficulties in understanding school science. However the challenge for students is not only to understand. They need to move from everyday to scientific knowledge, with a concomitant change to more technical language use (Polias, 2016). The necessary shift along the register continum requires modeling from the teacher. In the observed lessons, the teacher presents meanings in a more everyday realization, but she does not then reword into the more technical language of the scientific knowledge. Exposure to the necessary language would not in itself be sufficient however; students need to be apprenticed into the use of this language (Lemke, 1990; Mortimer & Scott, 2003; Polias, 2016).

By providing the complicated apparatus that led to the above difficultie, the textbook had a considerable effect on these lessons. The influence of textboos i common in Hong Kong and elsewhere (Pun, 2019; Wellington & Osborne, 2001), and was acknowledged by Hannah and the other participating teachers in interviews. Publishers in Hong Kong are keen to reduce the written text in coursebooks, and the trend towards textual simplification is not new (Unsworth, 1998; Wellington & Osborne, 2001). The assumption is that less and simpler, writing will make the materias easer for students with 2 English. Hwever, reduction of written text can make the learning task more dificult (Maxwell-Reid & Lau, 2016). Here, condensation of the visual material, from the two images of MS (Appendix) to the single more complex UIS image (Fig. 1), also caused difficulties.

# 6.1. Implications for teaching and research

Findings suggest general areas for teacher development and specific advice for Hannah in the teaching of this topic. The collaboration between a science educator and an educational linguist ensured these suggestions were targeted towards currculum needs. Linguistic provided the genre analysis, which identified the confusion of purpose between description (ofapparatus) and explanation (of energy conversion). Genre analysis also highlighted the particular role of the conclusion stage in signaling learning priorities to students. Science education contributed expert knowledge of the curriculum, with, for example, the relationship of leson material to the curricular objectives, and the rlative mportance f oncepts. Thus explanation f enery conversion was identified as the priority, with description of the dual-purpose apparatus not in fact needed. This balance of priorities was in marked contrast with what was observed in the lessons.

The advice for Hannah covered use of genre, language and staging of activities, and sugested that MS provides greater asstance than UIs. Thus dealing with the motor and the generator separately would enable the teacher to work on explaining (two separate systems),rather than describing (one complex piece of apparatus), thereby making the learning objectives clearer for students. For each system, the simpler aparatus can be briefly described, before moving to the observed sequence of events and their relation tothe energy conversions. Concluding stages can emphasise the focus on the conversions. The explanation of energy conversion can be facilitated by clausal and phrasal embeddings, for example (9) and (10), and more precise language for the observation of events can help prepare students for these embeddings. Staging of activities can also asst student larning. Students can work towards and rehearse the required knowledge in groups, with support such as flowcharts, diagrams and information gap activities as in the Appendix. It may be argued that these changes would slow down the lessons. However, student confusion also slows down progress, and moreover, could affect students' attitudes towards science classes.

Learning to consider genre and to develop the language of science with students in these ways places an extra demand on the teacher. The challenge is further increasewhen studnts are allowed to affect the development of the leson with questions and ther interventions, and Hannah's classes were more dialogic than most we observed. The linguisic pedagogical content knowledge (LPCK) required to face these challenges cannot be ssumed, ut needs to be icluded in teacher education programmes (Accurso, 2020; Love, 2009; Rappa & Tang, 2018).

Further research is also needed, to explore difficulty in this and other parts of the science curriculum. More examples of classroom explanations are needed, as wel as other geres and language resources, and also other modalitie. For example, the language focus in this paper has been the expansion of the nominal group, as llustrated in (9) and (10). Other related areas to investigate would include cause-efectrelations in explanations, or the signaling of teacher summaries. t would alobe inteesting to ee Hannah try the lesons again using the divided diagrams and the other suggestions, as she intends to do if she has the chance to teach this topic again.

# 7. Conclusion

Difficulty isa key concern for EMI schooling. This paper considered dificulties expressed by students and teacher in the junior science topic of energy conversion, and benefitted from the collaboration between a functional linguist and a science education specialist.

In questionnaires and during the essons, students expressed confusion over the main learning point. Key to the confusion was the emphasis placed on description of complex aparatus, when the curriculum required greater attention to explanation of energy conversions. Also relevant were teacher questioning techniques, with language that stayed at the everyday end of the everyday. scientific register continuum and lacked technical precision. Genre, guided by science education, helped to identify and analyse the difficulties in these lessons, and also to suggest how the teacher can make changes to overcome these problems.

Institutional conditions may not always encourage researchers from different fields to work together inthis way, but we eel that the collaboration was beneficial. Linguistic insights were validated and directed to the specific needs of the science education class room, and advice for the science teacher was made more specific and also more authoritative through the involvement of the subject specialist.
