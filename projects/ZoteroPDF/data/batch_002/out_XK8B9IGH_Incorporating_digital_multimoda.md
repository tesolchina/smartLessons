Multimodal discourse analysis

Digital multimodal composition (DMC), which involves the use of multiple semiotic resources, has been extensively researched in language education. However, limited research has been conducted on the integration of DMC in content-based instruction. This study aims to fill this research gap by examining the use of DMC in an introductory legal studies course and discussing its potential benefits for content teaching. Five student-generated legal popularization videos, which explain concepts in English company law, were collected. Drawing upon Hafner’s (2015) framework for remix practices in multimodal composition, these videos were analyzed using a software-assisted systemic functional approach to multimodal discourse analysis. This approach is based on the principles that multimodal semiotic resources are combined to create intended meanings and that the choice of resources is socially negotiated. Findings from the multimodal discourse analysis of the DMC product were triangulated with students’ reflective essays to un derstand the motivations behind their semiotic choices. The analysis reveals that students consciously appropriate various generic, (sub)cultural, and semiotic resources as well as multi modal artefacts when explaining legal knowledge to an indefinite audience. The videos demon strate that DMC allows learners to critically reconsider the meaning and practical aspects of legal concepts while recontextualizing technical legal knowledge for a general audience.

# 1. Introduction

Digital multimodal composition (DMC) refers to the composing practice that involves the use of multiple semiotic resources afforded by digital technologies. Such practice is found to have multiple affordances in an English language teaching setting, including technological (e.g., recording students’ voiceovers for revision enhancement), educational (e.g., learning English in an authentic setting), and social affordances (e.g., facilitating a participatory culture) (Jiang, 2017). A wide array of empirical studies have reported the benefits of including DMC in second language teaching pedagogy, such as strengthening their authorial voices and identity (Cimasko & Shin, 2017), enhancing the awareness of audience and communicative purposes in the remediation process (Hafner, 2014), increasing self-efficacy and confidence through peer support and collaboration (Jiang et al., 2020), increased learners’ au tonomy (Hafner & Miller, 2011) as well as encouraging more text generation than traditional writing (Kim et al., 2023). Due to DMC’s benefits, extensive research has looked into its pedagogical value and impact on learners’ communicative practices. One area of focus in this research is educators’ engagement with DMC, which includes its incorporation within the context of high-stakes print-based testing (Zuo & He, 2023), as well as examining teachers’ design of writing tasks that integrate multiple modes of communication across various disciplines (Lim & Polio, 2020) and methods for assessing DMC (Hafner & Ho, 2020). Another line of research has investigated learners’ learning processes and outcomes, including their resemiotization processes (Cimasko & Shin, 2017), experiences with translanguaging (Ho, 2022), coordination of different semiotic resources (Shin et al., 2020), and their creation of multimodal en sembles (Hafner, 2014).

The existing research on DMC primarily emphasizes its use in language learning and teaching. However, there has been relatively limited investigation into incorporating DMC in content-based instruction. Zhang et al. (2021) confirmed this research gap in their systematic review, which found that most studies on DMC focused on language classrooms. Ho’s (2022) study is among the few which explores the integration of DMC in content teaching. In her study, English-major undergraduates were required to create an instructional video explaining the concept of multimodality to a lay audience. In the process, students were found to bring multiple semiotic resources, their own identities, and out-of-classroom experiences in the meaning-creation process and create a translanguaging space to experiment with academic genres. We can see that in this study DMC facilitates content teaching by allowing students to evolve from a language learner to a knowledge sharer. The researcher, therefore, advocates for exploring DMC in content courses, emphasizing that it provides “a creative space for students to consolidate and demonstrate understanding of abstract knowledge in content courses” (p.1).

Building on Ho’s advocacy, we can further explore the reasons for incorporating DMC in content-based instruction by examining the alignment between the theoretical foundations of DMC and the objectives and expectations of content courses. Jiang and Hafner (2024) outlined the theoretical frameworks that inform existing DMC research, including multimodal, sociocultural, and cognitive approaches. First, the multimodal approach views DMC as a process of creating meaning through multiple semiotic resources, resulting in multimodal products. Many content areas, such as science, mathematics, and social studies, involve abstract concepts that can be challenging for students to grasp. DMC allows these concepts to be visualized through graphics, animations, and simulations. Visual representations can make abstract ideas more concrete and accessible, thereby facilitating students’ comprehension and conceptual development of the target content. Second, the sociocultural approach to language and literacy education perceives DMC as goal-directed social practices infused with composers’ identities, literacy practices, and experiences. Learners in content courses are expected to engage in various disciplinary practices that serve different purposes and involve both linguistic and non-linguistic modes (Grapin & Llosa, 2020). Incorporating DMC in content teaching can provide opportunities for students to engage in authentic communicative scenarios where they can experiment with future digitally mediated disciplinary practices. Third, the cognitive approach views DMC as a cognitive process involving a range of functional skills. Throughout this process, learners are prompted to engage in critical thinking and link different forms of representation. This fosters the development of higher-order thinking skills, including analyzing, evaluating, and synthesizing information. Content courses often involve complex concepts and information. As learners re-present content knowledge in digital form, they must understand the material and find methods to re-contextualize it. This cognitive engagement can deepen learners’ understanding and retention of the content. Similarly, just as content instruction can benefit from DMC, DMC research can benefit from exploring its potential in a content instruction context. By situating DMC within content instruction, researchers can investigate learners’ multimodal creation of disciplinary meaning in specific content areas, in addition to general meaning-making.

From a pedagogical perspective, integrating DMC with content instruction addresses the essential need to prepare students for future professional development. Belcher (2017) emphasizes that educators must support language and literacy learners in adopting a mindful and logical approach to using technology, enabling them to achieve their communicative goals and actively engage with real-world audiences through digital tools. This need extends beyond language learners to include content learners. The need for digitally mediated communication does not just take place within a language but also within a discipline. If digital literacy practices have been gradually extended from the personal realm to diverse professional contexts (Darvin & Hafner, 2022), students will inevitably encounter communicative scenarios where they must communicate disciplinary content knowledge through digital tools. The present study exemplifies an effort to integrate DMC into content teaching by specifically investigating students’ DMC practices within a legal content course. The study examines how exactly learners appropriate various resources to explain legal knowledge to a general audience, a kind of knowledge often perceived as highly technical due to its complex terminologies and conventions. Through this investigation, the study aims to shed light on the feasibility and effectiveness of incorporating DMC in content teaching, particularly in relation to the field of law.

# 2. Multimodal writing products by L2 learners

The shift towards multimodal composing has redefined the concept of writing, offering writers abundant opportunities to utilize diverse resources and prompting them to consider the impact of their chosen medium on the overall context and intended message. Li and Storch (2017) highlight that writing has been “reconceptualized as multimodal composing,” providing writers with “rich op portunities to deploy multiple resources (e.g., linguistic, visual, audio, gestural, and spatial) (p.1).” In multimodal composing, students must consider how their chosen medium (e.g., a written essay or a video presentation) contributes to the overall context and influences the message they wish to convey (Miller-Cochran, 2017). Through this process, they address real rhetorical needs and learn to employ various multimodal semiotic modes to respond effectively.

The importance of multimodal composition has sparked a growing body of research in this area. One area of investigation that researchers have focused on is the perspective of learners. Some studies have explored both the process and outcomes of multimodal composition, examining how learners utilize various resources to create multimodal products. For example, Jocius (2018) studied the collaborative multimodal composition practices of two young adolescents as they worked together on literature responses. The findings revealed that they actively engaged in interactive roles during the collaborative process. In another study, Smith et al. (2017)

examined the engagement of three bilingual eighth-grade students in multimodal code-meshing while creating a digital project. The researchers explored how the students used composing tools, visual brainstorming, and their heritage languages in their collaborative processes. Tan (2023) compared the cognitive processes of learners in multimodal composing and traditional writing. The study found that students in both practices consulted external sources and revised their texts. However, students who engaged in multimodal composing demonstrated greater autonomy in their writing and displayed more complex text-borrowing behaviors. These studies primarily focus on the composing process, often using multimodal artifacts or screen recordings as data sources to supplement the examination of the composition process.

There are also studies that focus more on the multimodal products themselves, using the data on the composition process as a supplementary means to understand the discursive features of these products. For instance, Shin et al. (2020) conducted a study on sixth-grade second language (L2) writers and their creation of multimodal PowerPoint slides explaining the greenhouse effect. The findings revealed that the students exhibited an evolving understanding of the connections between different modes and the functions of sign systems in a non-linear manner. The linguistic and visual modes were aligned and mutually reinforced, with non-linguistic resources playing a primary role in conveying ideational meanings. Furthermore, in addition to examining multimodal features, some studies have investigated the authorial identities demonstrated in multimodal writing products. Cimasko and Shin (2017) explored the process of transforming an argumentative essay into a multimodal digital video in a first-year ESL composition class. The results indicated that incorporating multimedia elements for remediation provided the student with additional semiotic resources to enhance their authorship. However, contextual factors such as the intended audience and the chosen medium imposed limitations on the student’s authorial expression.

The findings of these studies indicate that multimodal composing extends beyond mere writing with the inclusion of non-linguistic resources. It is a socially mediated practice that requires learners to make deliberate rhetorical decisions concerning media tools, sociopersonal factors, and textual experiences. However, it is important to note that most existing studies are primarily situated in a general English for academic purposes context, overlooking the investigation of multimodal composing within specific disciplinary contexts. Consequently, these studies may not fully capture the influence of disciplinary knowledge and disciplinary culture on multimodal composing within a disciplinary context.

The present study aims to explore how students engage in multimodal composing within the legal discipline. Despite the long standing view that law relies heavily on language-based communication to ensure knowledge accuracy, it is evident that legal practitioners increasingly face the need for multimodal communication. They may need to convey legal knowledge to non-experts through platforms like websites (Polese & D’avanzo, 2012), blogs (Anesa, 2018) or YouTube videos (Cavalieri, 2018).

These digitally mediated forms of legal communication require practitioners to effectively convey legal concepts, provide accurate advice, and navigate complex legal issues using diverse digital and multimodal resources. Given these communication needs, it is crucial for legal educators to consider fostering students’ competence in multimodal communication within the field. To initiate such pedagogical efforts, it is essential to examine how law students communicate legal knowledge through their digital multimodal productions.

# 3. Legal English and legal popularization

Studying law is inseparable from learning the language. Maley (1994) points out that “language is the medium, process, and product in the various arenas of the law where legal texts, spoken or written, are generated in the service of regulating social behavior” (p.11). This indicates that a comprehensive understanding of legal concepts heavily relies on a sound grasp of legal language. While Maley’s argument is applicable to any language, it is especially relevant to the English language since English has become the lingua franca in legal training and practice. For example, in areas heavily influenced by the common law tradition, law students and legal professionals must be proficient in English to navigate the Anglo-American legal system effectively. Furthermore, English has become the predominant language in international legal transactions (Northcott, 2009).

In response to this trend, educators have developed various legal English courses. For instance, Yu and Xiao (2013) designed a legal English course specifically for law school students. The course aimed to enhance students’ listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills through engaging in diverse legal discourses and genres, such as court interactions, legal job interviews, and case reports. Similarly, Chendeb (2020) employed the Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) approach to design a legal English course to enhance Lebanese law professionals’ competence in constructing oral and written legal genres. This approach focused on integrating content knowledge with language development. It is evident that in legal English education, educators often prioritize communication within professional and academic contexts. However, there has been limited attention given to training learners’ ability to effectively communicate legal knowledge to a general audience, commonly known as legal popularization.

Following Gotti’s (2011) definition of popularization, legal popularization can be broadly perceived as the process of reformulating or recontextualizing legal knowledge in a way that is understandable to individuals who have little or no legal background, while preserving the original content. This practice is crucial for legal professionals as they often encounter various communication activities that involve non-specialist audiences. Examples include explaining legal terms to lay juries in court, writing client opinion letters to address legal inquiries, and disseminating legal information to the general public. Therefore, legal popularization is an essential component of a legal professional’s communicative repertoire.

Various studies have investigated legal popularization practice in different contexts. A frequently researched interaction is jury trials where judges and attorneys are obliged to facilitate jurors’ understanding of law-related content as they are required to make significant decisions on trial (Anesa, 2013; Boginskaya, 2022). Recently, an increasing number of studies have explored technology mediated legal popularization, such as the legal blog of environmental law (Anesa, 2018), online legal forum (Boginskaya, 2021; Diani,

2023), the “Summaries of EU legislations” website (Polese & D’avanzo, 2012), and YouTube videos popularizing family law (Cavalieri, 2018). Cavalieri’s (2018) study stands out as one of the few that examines the incorporation of multimodal elements in legal popu larization. The researcher noted the use of embodied modes, camera angles, and artificial settings in a YouTube video introducing family law. While the study primarily focuses on linguistic popularization strategies in the video, it acknowledges the use of digital technology and multimodality in legal popularization practice.

The need to effectively communicate legal concepts to non-specialists in real-world scenarios highlights the importance of pre paring learners to convey legal knowledge using multimodal resources. One approach to address this is by involving students in DMC practice, where they can experience presenting legal information to a general audience through multiple semiotic resources afforded by digital tools. An example that closely aligns with this practice is a legal English course discussed by Hafner and Miller (2019). In this course, students are assigned the task of creating a multimodal artifact, specifically a public service brochure, aimed at educating the general public about important provisions of legislation that impact their everyday lives. In a similar vein, the current study involved students in the creation of a more multimodal artifact—a digital video that introduces legal concepts in company law. By examining the legal popularization videos produced by the students, the study aims to explore how learners adapt legal knowledge for a general audience with reference to the following research question:

How do learners of law remix multiple resources to communicate content knowledge to a non-specialist audience in their digitalmultimodal composition practice?

# 4. Remix and digital multimodal composition

Remixing is an artistic practice that involves duplicating, modifying, and merging pre-existing content. It encompasses various forms of creative expression, such as music, videos, texts, and mixed media (Lessig, 2008). While the term originally referred to creating alternative dance versions of songs for marketing purposes in the 1970s (Borschke, 2011), its definition has expanded to include other types of creative content generation based on existing works. The concept of remixing, which involves building upon previous works, aligns with certain theoretical concepts in applied linguistics. For instance, intertextuality, as defined by Chouliaraki and Fairclough (1999), refers to “the combination in my discourse of my voice and the voice of another”. Another relevant term is interdiscursivity, which refers to “appropriation of generic resources”(Bhatia, 2017, p. 5). While these terms emphasize different aspects and are not entirely equivalent in theory, they collectively highlight the pervasive trend of drawing upon prior texts, knowledge, or discursive practices in content generation.

The concept of remix is valuable in studying DMC practices due to the inherent need for authors to engage in remixing. Digital tools used in DMC offer authors a range of semiotic resources, resulting in digital multimodal videos that are essentially remixes of sound, text, video extracts, and other diverse semiotic elements. Furthermore, these digital tools facilitate broad access to the produced videos. In order to cater to a diverse and heterogeneous audience, authors of multimodal compositions often combine not only multimodal resources but also draw upon shared experiences, cultures, and identities that the online audience can relate to. For instance, Amgott (2020) discovered that American undergraduates incorporated languages, cultures, and identities in their digital multimodal reflections and vlogs to establish cultural connections and convey emotions. In summary, DMC involves the integration and utilization of various resources, a characteristic that aligns well with the notion of remix. In fact, some scholars argue that remix literacy, referring to “the skills needed to create remixes that are deemed effective by communities”, is an essential component of digital literacies (Stedman, 2012, p. 107).

The present study draws upon Hafner’s (2015) framework for remix practices in multimodal composition to examine students’ legal popularization videos. Hafner’s model defines remix practice as the appropriation of various resources and identifies four kinds of remix practices based on the analysis of student-generated scientific documentaries: (1) chunking, namely, combining a multimodal artifact created by one’s own with artifacts created by others in sequence; (2) layering, namely, combining one semiotic resource contributed by others with the student-generated video; (3) blending, referring to the mixing of generic features; (4) and intercultural blending, namely mixing the cultural resources. The selection of this framework is motivated by two factors. Firstly, the framework offers an extensive understanding of the elements that can be remixed in a digital multimodal product, encompassing not just semiotic resources but also multimodal artifacts, generic resources, and cultural resources. Secondly, the framework is grounded in empirical research on student-generated DMC products, aligning closely with the objective of uncovering features in student-generated legal popularization videos.

# 5. The study

# 5.1. Context of the study

The context for this study is a legal studies course at an English-medium university in China. The aim of the course is to introduce terminologies in English company law to third-year English major undergraduates who have very limited legal knowledge base of commercial law. Students who take this course intend to apply for juris doctoral programs at law schools in common law jurisdictions that do not require a bachelor’s degree in law. The course is offered to familiarize the learners with key concepts in company law and prepare them for advanced legal studies. One assignment of the course is for the students to construct a seven-minute video that explains a legal concept in company law to a general audience in English. Students were given a choice between two broad topics for their assignment: “life cycle of business organizations” or “types of people in the company.” These topics were selected because they covered most of the material discussed in the course. The first topic includes aspects such as the pre-incorporation, formation, registration, capital raising, and liquidation of a company. The second topic focuses on different individuals involved in a company, including shareholders, directors, auditors, and their respective activities. By offering general topics instead of specific ones, students had the freedom to choose relevant legal content for their videos while staying within the scope of the course. In the guideline, students were provided with suggestions on which aspects of the topics can be included in the video and were reminded that they can decide aspects of the topic that they think is interesting and relevant to a lay audience. To boost students’ motivation, they were told that these videos were likely to be posted on a course blog on social media and they were also free to post them on popular video platforms.

# 5.2. Data sources and research methods

This study draws upon data from a larger research project investigating the development of digital multimodal communicative competence in content language integrated instruction, which has been running for two years at the time of writing. The research methodology takes on a qualitative interpretive paradiam. This kind of paradigm is concerned with understanding the social context of phenomena, focusing on the complexities and subtleties of human experience (Denzin & Lincoln, 2011). To achieve this, researchers need to go into the fields to see what is going on (Holliday, 2013). A total of 32 students participated in the project – in eleven groups of two or three students. The data collected for the larger research project include the 11 videos made by the groups. The longest video lasts 480 seconds and the shortest one 360 seconds, with an average of 445 seconds. In addition, 32 pieces of individually written reflective essays reflecting upon the construction process were collected to understand the “emic” perspective, namely, “an insider’s perspective on events” (Richards, 2003, p. 15) In the reflective essays, students answered four questions as to (1) their general impression of working on the project, (2) the main challenges they encountered and solutions implemented, (3) important aspects of communication when conveying specialized knowledge to a non-specialist audience, including strategies used in the video and (4) any changes in the understanding of legal communication. Students were also encouraged to discuss any particular aspect of the video product they wished to highlight. The reflective essays ranged from 956 to 1096 words, with an average length of 1080 words. Together with the reflective essays, each student also submitted materials demonstrating their composing process, including written notes, scripts, group discussion records, storyboards as well as semi-products. These materials were referred to in the reflective essays to illustrate their points.

An initial analysis of the video created by students revealed several features of the products. First, all groups were successful in achieving the designated communicative functions. They selected a topic umbrellaed by the give topic and explained the legal knowledge around the topic in their videos. Secondly, the eleven groups adopted different types of videos. Most groups adopted storytelling-based videos with plotting, where legal concepts are explained through the conversation between human or non-human characters. A few groups took on a tutorial-alike video where the legal concepts were presented through one-person narratives. Others combined these two forms with storytelling being a rhetorical hook and tutorials were used in the main body of the video. The third feature of the student videos is a notable varied quality in the videos. The quality of the video was evaluated from the perspectives of content and organization, multimodal design as well as delivery. The better ones (scored as A- or A range) normally have creative plotting, coherent structure as well as attractive multimodal design, which altogether contribute to effective legal knowledge delivery. The weaker ones tend to have some issues such as occasional technical issues, inappropriate pace, as well as incoherence in content delivery.

For the purpose of this article, five students videos made by 15 students (5 groups of three students each) and 15 individually authored reflective essays were selected for detailed analysis. The ultimate aim of selection of the video tries to be typical and representative of all the videos created. The selecting criteria include the level of quality, the types of video and the range of topic. The procedure for selection was for two researchers (including the Author) to standardize the grading procedure and grade the videos. The grading process categorizes the videos into above-average range, average range and below-average range. In each range, the selection considers the necessity to include the three types of video (storytelling, tutorial and combination). Besides, the ultimate videos can cover various topics umbrellaed by the given topic. The selected videos focus on topics including company liquidation, company secretaries, the advantages and disadvantages of different business types, as well as the birth and dissolution of a company. The lengths of the videos range from 360 seconds to 480 seconds (see Table 1).

It is important to note that interviews and stimulated recalls were not utilized in this study. This decision was driven by practical considerations: the participants, engaged in their final year summer internships as required by the university, were unable to commit to interviews. However, they consented to provide reflective essays and accompanying work-in-progress materials. While this constraint limited the types of data sources available, the fifteen reflective essays, averaging 1080 words, along with the supplementary materials referred to in the essays, offer substantial insights into the students’ perspectives. The depth and breadth of the reflective essays, combined with the additional documents, ensure a robust and comprehensive understanding of the students’ experiences and re flections, validating the study’s findings despite the absence of interviews and stimulated recalls.

Data analysis consists of three stages: initial inductive thematic analysis of the reflective essays, multimodal analysis of the videos and follow-up deductive thematic analysis of the reflective data. Initially, the 32 reflective essays were analyzed using thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The purpose was to understand the students’ digital multimodal composition process in general and students’ perspectives in making the video. To conduct the thematic analysis, the process began with re-reading the reflective data to familiarize with the dataset and take notes on any initial observations. A data-driven inductive analysis was then employed to generate a tentative coding scheme. This scheme was applied to code five pieces of reflective essays. Simultaneously, a colleague with expe rience in thematic analysis independently coded the same five essays. We met to compare our coding and refined the coding scheme based on this discussion. The refined scheme was then used by the author to code the remaining reflective essays, with adjustments made as necessary. Themes regarding appropriating semiotic resources in the video construction and practice on legal popularization were particularly highlighted for the purpose of the present study. The thematic analysis was facilitated by MAXQDA 2022 (VERBI Software, 2021).

With an understanding of students’ digital multimodal composing process, multimodal discourse analysis was performed. Drawing upon Hafner’s (2015) theoretical model, the five videos were first viewed repeatedly with the aim of identifying the segments that involve the remix practices mentioned above. After that, selective multimodal analysis was performed on the identified extracts. The video extracts were divided into shots for further multimodal transcription. Drawing upon the system of multimodal transcription system developed by Hafner (2014) and Valeiras-Jurado and Bernad-Mecho ´ (2022), special attention was paid to the following aspects of each shot (see Table 2): setting (interior, exterior, artificial), represented participants (character, visuals), character (human, non-human), speech, gesture (iconic, metaphoric, deictic and beats), gaze (direct and indirect), background music (lively and slow-paced), angles of shots (oblique, front and back), height of shots (low, high, eye-level), distance of shots (close, medium and long) and visual prompts (text and image). The multimodal transcription was facilitated by the software Multimodal Analysis Video (Multimodal Analysis Company Pte Ltd., 2018). This software provides an interface that makes it easy to unfold transcripts, visual information from the video and semiotic choices by allowing researchers to parse each moment into component parts (see Fig. 1).

The last stage involved cross-checking the remix patterns identified in the multimodal analysis with the reflective data. First, the reflective data from the authors of the five videos was gathered and categorized by group. Since the multimodal discourse analysis had revealed remix patterns in each video, a deductive thematic analysis was employed, focusing on questions such as why students remix resources in specific ways. In other words, the remix practices identified in each video were used as a lens to closely examine the related reflective data. The colleague involved in the initial thematic analysis was invited to participate again. For each video, the reflective essays were carefully read, and extracts related to the emerging remix patterns were highlighted. Next, the two researchers individually coded the reflective essays from Group 1 and met to discuss the codes. During the discussion, the codes were refined and adjusted. The researchers then used the revised codes to analyze the remaining four groups’ reflective data. Finally, the researchers met to discuss the coding, resolving any discrepancies through discussion.

# 6. Students’ remix practice in explaining the legal content

# 6.1. Mixing generic resources

One type of remix practice identified in the present data set is “blending” (Hafner, 2015), namely, the mixing of generic resources. Sample 1 Liquidation video, which appropriates resources of film, TikTok and comics is an illustration of this remix practice (see Fig. 2). The video explains the order of priority when various kinds of charge holders intend to realize their charges on an insolvent company’s property. The students set the scene in an imaginary company, King Ma Group, which faces a severe financial crisis and cannot pay off all the creditors – an unsecured creditor Tyron, a secured creditor CEO of a local bank Henry and a company’s own employee Taki. To resolve the dispute, the company director hires a liquidator – a legal professional dealing with the assets of an insolvent company— to pay off the creditors in order of priority. What finally happens is that after gathering all the company’s assets, they are only sufficient to pay the liquidator’s expenses. We can see that the storytelling, the settings, narrative elements, plots, and the characters in the video allude to the use of filmmaking styles and techniques that are customarily leveraged in film genres.

On the other hand, the video employs a vertical perspective and employs medium and close shots of the characters while mini mizing the depiction of the surroundings (see Shot 11 in Fig. 3). These semiotic choices differentiate it from the conventional film genre which typically employs a landscape orientation. The filming choices made in the student sample evoke the features of TikTok videos—a short-form video format that allows ordinary users to create and interact through amateur recorded videos (Kennedy, 2020). TikTok videos offer users the option to shoot from a vertical perspective, which fits squarely with the screens of mobile phones, making it easy for social media users to consume the content. As a result, most TikTok videos have a raw editing style with minimal delicate shot switches, perfect filters, or polishing, embracing “authenticity, idiosyncrasy, and self-deprecating humor” (Jerasa & Boffone, 2021, p.220).

It is important to note the semiotic choices afforded by a TikTok video aligns well with the narrative and character development in this Liquidation story. The audience must fully understand the creditors’ identities before perceiving the order of priority of paying off debts. In this video, it is through the performance of the actors that the audience can know the creditors’ profession, debt status and their relation to the insolvent company. It is therefore crucial for the audience to focus on the actors rather than the surroundings. Given this, TikTok’s unique vertical shooting perspective can help focus the audience’s attention on the characters’ acting, which very probably facilitates the audience’s understanding of the legal knowledge. The student group confirmed their deliberate use of TikTok video format in their filmmaking. When commenting on the reasons for adopting the format, the group of students felt that “the young generation likes using TikTok” (G1, Kevin, a pseudonym) and that it has “popularity among the public” (G1, Jason, a pseudonym). Furthermore, the TikTok application’s default “editing convenience” (G1, Jason) is another reason that the students decided to create a TikTok form film.

This video also incorporates elements from the genre of comics. As previously mentioned, the development of the characters plays a crucial role in explaining legal knowledge in this video. The creators of the video must ensure that a general audience can properly grasp the roles of the creditors and their relation to the insolvent company. As we can see in Shots 7, 12, and 21 in Fig. 3, the in formation is conveyed through a combination of written text and visuals, with the characters’ identities appearing on-screen as typed text, accompanied by images of the characters. Instead of presenting a single image of each character, the video employs three copresent panels to emphasize the same image. Additionally, the names and professions of the creditors are gradually revealed letter by letter, accompanied by typewriter sound effects. This paneling layout draws inspiration from the comics genre, where characters’ images are highlighted to capture the audience’s attention. The writing style resembles the exposition commonly found in comics, providing the necessary details readers need to comprehend the story.

Other examples of appropriation of generic resources were also observed in the data. For instance, students might create a hybrid that combines the film genre used for storytelling and elements of online teaching videos for explaining key legal terminologies. One potential challenge caused by this kind of hybridization is that as two genres tend to involve different types of discourse modes, it is likely to generate a patchwork jumble rather than a coherent whole if students do not remix the generic resources properly.

# 6.2. Mixing multimodal artefacts

Fig. 4 is an extract from the beginning section of Sample 2 the Company Secretary video. This video aims to convey knowledge about the functions and job responsibilities of company secretaries by “subvert[ing] the stereotype about company secretary” as commented by a student (Ashley, G2). By stating “subverting the stereotype”, the groups meant that they intended to change the typical impression that a company secretary only needs to wear delicate makeup and be well-dressed and convey the knowledge that the profession must be conversant with company governance and corporate mechanism, as prescribed in Company Law. To achieve this end, the video starts with a close shot of a phone playing a trailer of a popular Korean TV drama What’s Wrong with Secretary Kim (Shot 1a). In the extract, the elegant and well-groomed company secretary Kim walks confidently and turns on the light of the office with an easy snap and then professionally reports the agenda to a disgruntled boss. The extract ends up with Kim facing the camera confidently with her arms crossed over her waist, indicating that she is fully capable of her job. When the camera zooms out, it turns out that a bunny is watching the trailer on the mobile and phone and dreaming about becoming a company secretary like Kim (Shot 1b-1e). Subsequently, in Shot 2, the same extract is presented again in full screen, this time without the original soundtrack. After that, suddenly, the second bunny shows up and has a conversation with the first bunny (Shot 3 and 4).

This remix practice resembles what Hafner (2015) refers to as “chunking”, namely, “students combine a multimodal artifact of their own in sequence with artifacts created by others, as a series of multimodal chunks one after the other” (p. 503). In the present study, the students’ decision to adopt this kind of remix partly arises from their intention to arouse the audience’s curiosity with some interesting content. As commented by Ashley (G2, a pseudonym), “starting with a familiar stereotype can pique the audience’s in terest.” More importantly, they decide to remix because the appropriated clip properly representing the general public’s understanding of the “company secretary” creates a stereotype that can be shattered later through the communication of the legal knowledge in the subsequent section of the video. Another group member commented that they “chose to start with the stereotype about company secretaries. In our story, we endeavored to subvert this stereotype and prove that secretaries carry a burden as liaisons among various departments. We used professional knowledge to challenge these stereotypes and convince our audience.” (Mandy, G2, a pseudonym).

In the “chunking” practice, it is interesting to note that the same multimodal artifact – namely, the video clip of the trailer – is used three times in this short extract but is used differently each time. At first, the clip is played on Bunny’s mobile phone with the trailer’s original soundtrack and the student video’s background music (shot 1a). As such, it can arouse the audience’s interest and effectively lead to the main character’s entrance. For the second time, the trailer is co-present with a close-up shot showing Bunny glimpsing at the clip (Shot 1d). Aurally, the clip’s original soundtrack is muted, and the audience can only hear Bunny’s narration (“If I were a company secretary”) as well as the added background music. This indicates that Bunny is genuinely intrigued by the profession, which ratio nalizes the subsequent plot where Bunny is eager to know more about it. When the trailer is shown for the third time (see Shot 2), a close shot of Secretary Kim is presented on the full screen with the added background music alone, without the original soundtrack or Bunny’s narration. These semiotic choices seem to highlight Kim’s beauty and attractiveness, accordant with the common misun derstanding of the profession. An additional point worth mentioning is that the conversation between Secretary Kim and the boss is not translated or subtitled. One possible consequence of this semiotic decision is that the audience who do not understand Korean can only focus on Kim’s acts and appearance. As such, the stereotype is further strengthened. It can be seen from the example that students strategically choose other people’s multimodal artifacts to spark the audience’s interest and engage them before they can popularize specialized knowledge. They also manipulate the visibility and salience of semiotic resources in the borrowed artifacts to fit their purposes. A related problem here is that sometimes the soundtrack added by the students (for instance, the background music) might overlap with the sound effect of the borrowed sources, which occasionally results in dissonant sound effect.

Another noteworthy point illustrated by this example is the copyright issue. While remix practice has been controversial with regards to the copyright issue, this kind of remix practice – chunking – is even more delicate compared to other kinds of remix practice in that it involves the appropriation of a multimodal ensemble created by others rather than one single type of semiotic mode. It is interesting to note that how this student group deals with the copyright of the appropriated source. When talking about the copyright issue, Mandy stated that one strategy they use is to intentionally play the video clip on the phone and then shoot the phone in order to explicitly demonstrate that the video clip is borrowed material rather than created by their own. Moreover, when the trailer is demonstrated in the full screen, the streaming service provider “tvN”, the name of the TV drama (“김비서가 왜 그럴까”) and the broadcast time (“6월6일 [수] 밤 9시 30분 첫 방송 “) are intentionally left there to acknowledge the source. These efforts show that students are aware of the copyright issue when remixing the sources and intentionally delineate the boundaries between appropriated content and student-generated content.

# 6.3. Mixing cultural resources

Another kind of remix identified in the text is a mixture of cultural resources, referred to as “intercultural blending” by Hafner (2015). For the purpose of the current study, culture is conceived more broadly as “the values, customs, beliefs and symbolic practices by which men and women live” and “a whole way of life” (Eagleton, 2016, p. 1). In this section, examples are analyzed to illustrate how students incorporate cultural elements when they popularize legal knowledge. Fig. 5 is an extract from the Starting a Business video which explains the functions and relationships of three kinds of business venture: sole trader, partnership, and registered company. In the video, the legal content is communicated through the story of a fresh graduate named Du Baibai who could not find a job after graduating from college (see Shot 2a and 2b) and decided to start his own business as a fortune teller(see Shot 3 and 4). His business venture begins with a sole trader. After successfully predicting a client’s fortune, he has his first business partner and develops the sole trader business into a partnership. With more media exposure and capital raising, the business venture grows into a registered company. Throughout the story, whenever the terminologies of company law appear, they are featured and explained in detail.

The video appropriates the (sub)cultural resources in the communication of legal content. The “fortune-telling” element fore grounded in this video is a kind of “popular astrology”, which is defined as “the astrological discourse (both theory and practice) of those who consult, with varying degrees of avidity and confidence, the sun-sign columns and articles in tabloid newspapers, women’s magazines, websites and call-lines” (Willis & Curry, 2020, p. 65). This (sub)culture develops with urbanization and is seen as “validly and inextricably a part of contemporary life” (Willis & Curry, 2020, p. 66). The underlying underpinning of astrological experience is that the future is not a fixed process and can be changed or interfered with by divination. This belief is embodied in multiple ways in the video. First, Du Baibai is determined to start fortune-telling business because his consultation of horoscope on the Internet instructs him to do so (Shot 3). This suggestion turns out to be obviously right as the business is becoming a tremendous commercial success. The character Du Baibai’s experience resembles the behavior of those who cling to astrology. In fact, it is argued that such a zeal for astrological sign is more prevalent in young millennials (1978–1996) and Generation Z (1997 onwards) who are disappointed in ecological and political issues faced by the world and intends to find interpretation in a framework that is different from ones used by their parents (for instance, religion) (Translated by Content Engine, 2022). The student video intentionally embraces and incorporates such an astrology culture in the storyline. Even the name of the story’s main character, “Du Baibai” per se is adapted from a well-renowned Chinese horoscope influencer Tao Baibai. When asked about the reason for appropriating the astrology culture in the popularization video, the student commented that their purpose is to use the popular culture to stimulate the audience’s interest: “We have paid more attention to the storytelling aspect of the video, using a coherent entrepreneurship story and integrating elements such as ‘fortune-telling’ and ‘zodiac signs’ to attract the audience’s attention and ensure knowledge dissemination” (Jane, G3, a Pseudonym).

![](img/fac8050239c8aaf23479554905cf6b4a8a8ef8b67c4c5bf5f62cd2406f4f9446.jpg)  
Fig. 5. Sample 3 Starting a Business video.

Hafner (2015) points out that one potential issue with mixing cultural elements is that the audience must have a knowledge base about the appropriated culture if they want to be aware of the reference. In the video, knowledge of Chinese traditional culture is required if the audience intends to fully understand it. For example, the interconnection between Yin and Yang (see Shot 4) refers to a kind of Chinese cosmological philosophy about changes and force in the world. Du Baibai wears glasses for the blind because in Chinese culture many fortune tellers are believed to be sightless to show that they do not rely on sight or speculation to tell the fate. It is worth noting that the appropriation of cultural elements takes place on the set out of the storytelling and are not functionally relevant to the legal terminologies the students intend to explicate in the video. Therefore, lack of knowledge of the cultural elements is unlikely to impede the audience from understanding the legal knowledge popularized in the video. Nevertheless, it may prevent the audience from noticing the references to the cultural elements intended in the video.

# 6.4. Mixing semiotic modes

Another kind of remix practice is to combine semiotic resources contributed by others with the ones contributed by students, as referred to as “layering” by Hafner (2015). In his study, the researcher identified frequent remixes of stock footage in students’ digital multimodal composition. In the present study of legal popularization videos, while using materials created by others as stock footage is rarely seen, mixing sound and images from other sources is noted in the data set.

The extract from Sample 2 Company Secretary video illustrated in Fig. 6 is an example of remixing semiotic resources. When the bunny compares a company to a machine (“If we say a company is a machine”), an image of a machine pops out at the righthand section of the frame (Shot 1a). Subsequently, the moment bunny highlights the company secretary’s liaison role, comparing it to the “gears of the machine”, an image of gears and the word “gears” shows up. Here, the simile is represented through the combination of three kinds of semiotic modes: the image of gear, the writing, and the speech. This extract shows the configuration of semiotic resources borrowed from other sources and the student-generated content. Specifically, the primary footage (i.e., the bunny puppet) created by students and student’s voiceover explaining the liaison function of a company secretary are combined with the background music and images taken from a Japanese website that provides free audio and visual materials. Students mentioned that they appropriated the semiotic resources because they “cannot create background music and the icons” (Susan, G2, a pseudonym). The remixed resources are therefore used to fill the gap because it is neither possible nor necessary to require students to create all the semiotic resources needed for a multimodal ensemble.

A particular issue that merits attention is why sometimes students choose not to appropriate specific semiotic resources even though such resources are downright available. This question arises from the observation that one group drew up all the stick figures on their own using the Procreate application and used them to visualize the legal terminologies in the video (see Fig. 7). Such practice may be due to two reasons. For one, when explaining highly abstract legal terms to the lay audience, students tend to determine which aspects of a complicated legal term will be elaborated. As such, it might be difficult to find visuals that can accurately represent the message that the students intend to convey. Given this, it seems wise to design visuals on their own that can precisely capture the legal knowledge to be popularized. A group member Cecilia (G4, a pseudonym) stated that she spent plenty of time drawing pictures that “ best fit my content”. In addition, the process of visualizing the concepts is a process of rethinking the legal terms, through which students may be able to strengthen their understanding of the legal content. As Cecilia commented, “In the process of creating pictures with my own understanding, I also gained a sense of happiness.”

# 7. Discussion and conclusion

The present study investigates how students mix various resources, including generic, cultural, and semiotic sources, to explain company law terminologies to a general audience through digital multimodal composition. Drawing upon Hafner’s (2015) framework of remix practice in DMC, it is found that students perform four kinds of remix in their popularization practice: 1) appropriation of generic resources (for example, mixing TikTok genre with film and comics); 2) inclusion of others’ multimodal artifacts; 3) mixing of (sub)cultural resources; 4) mixing of semiotic resources. Through examining students’ appropriation of various resources in explaining legal knowledge to a general audience, this section discusses how content teaching can benefit from digital multimodal composition – an approach commonly used in language learning and teaching.

Fig. 7. Sample 5 Business organization video.

The remix practices in students’ legal popularization videos reveal diverse methods of engaging with content learning in DMC practice. First, mixing generic resources requires students to choose the most suitable genre forms to communicate legal knowledge effectively. This process encourages them to carefully consider the legal content and decide which aspects to emphasize in their videos. By doing so, learners are motivated to reexamine the legal material, leading to deeper engagement with the subject matter. Similarly, remixing multimodal artifacts and (sub)cultural resources aids learning by prompting students to connect legal concepts with their audience’s interests and integrate out-of-class knowledge into their legal communication. Specifically, when working with multimodal artifacts, students might encounter copyright issues firsthand, prompting them to find ways to avoid infringement. This experiential learning is likely to deepen their understanding of legal content. Additionally, mixing semiotic modes allows learners to represent legal ideas, such as legal metaphors, through multiple semiotic resources. This active engagement encourages them to reconsider the characteristics of target legal terms and create meaning through multimodal design.

The findings suggest that incorporating DMC in content teaching creates an opportunity for students to have firsthand experimentation with recontextualization, defined by Bezemer and Kress (2008, p. 184) as “moving meaning material from one context with its social organization of participants and its modal ensembles to another, with its different social organization and modal ensembles.” While students acquire company law knowledge in academic contexts such as university lectures and academic reading, in doing the DMC project targeting a general online audience, they undoubtedly have to repositioned the legal knowledge for a different social situation, “reorganizing, refocusing and re-contextualizing it in order to reach a different audience” (Gimenez et al., 2020, p. 301). As digital tools have brought about an indefinite general audience to communicator, recontextualization has become a crucial composition practice in knowledge transformation processes in the time of web 2.0 – as P´erez-Llantada and Luzon ´ (2022) have pointed out. Therefore, this present study calls for an incorporation of DMC in content teaching to allow students experiment with recontextualization in digital knowledge production and dissemination.

Relatedly, the episode of recontextualization enabled in DMC allows learners to experience the process of “science accommodation” (Fahnestock, 1986) in which they can further experience identity transition. Science accommodation refers to the adjustment and reformulation in scientific communication to make scientific knowledge suitable for a general audience. In making the legal popularization video, students decide what aspects of the legal concept are to be conveyed to the audience and how they can be conveyed – either through the storytelling of an imagined company or the reversion of a stereotype. When they accommodate the legal knowledge and make them relevant to the imaged general audience, the accommodating process, in turn, requires them to re-situate the legal concept in the real-life scenario and, therefore, motivates learners to reconsider the practicality of terminologies. In this process, they transition from learners of company law who acquire such content through teaching and learning to “amateur expert[s]” (Bhatia, 2018), who are responsible for selecting the disciplinary knowledge to be popularized and make it accessible to complete amateurs. In so doing, they have transitioned from a recipient of knowledge to an active creator and disseminator of knowledge.

The analysis of the videos shows that integrating DMC in content teaching enables learners to create both “disciplinary expression” as well as “creative expression,” as Lim and Polio (2020) have categorized, and these two kinds of expression are intertwined in the composition. The study shows that students intentionally engage popular discourse and elements in the digital multimodal composing practice when introducing legal knowledge to the lay audience. This includes, for example, the appropriation of popular forms such as TikTok, popular content such as popular Korean TV drama, and popular subculture such as fortune-telling. In addition, it is worth noting that most of the popular elements are closely related to the disciplinary content rather than merely an ornamental addition. In other words, the inclusion of popular elements is an integral part of the communication of disciplinary content. For example, in the Company Secretary video, the video clip from the TV drama visualizes the stereotype of a company secretary that is intended to be subsequently shattered by the legal knowledge to be introduced. Similarly, in the Liquidation video, the three characters (an unsecured creditor, a secured creditor, and a company’s employee) are not created only for storytelling; more importantly, they set out the scene for further discussion of the priority of debt payment. It can be seen from the examples that the legal disciplinary content is communicated through multimodal creative expressions. This finding supports Ho’s (2022) call for “encouraging students to make use of their “enlarged” multimodal repertoire for disciplinary and creative expression” (p.11) and create a “translanguaging space” for communicating ideas.

The findings also show that the resemiotization practice inherent in digital multimodal composition urges learners to carefully reconsider the disciplinary concepts before they can reproduce the meaning precisely. This is mainly because DMC requires authors to consider multimodality, namely the “multi-semiotic complexity of a construct or a practice” (Iedema, 2003, p. 40), which further beget the need to reproduce meaning across different modalities. In the present study, when such a need is integrated into content teaching, learners are required to reproduce legal terminologies – which are normally expressed in written mode – using digital and multimodal semiotics. This requires authors to carefully consider the nature of the legal concept before they can represent the term through other modalities. For example, in the Company Secretary video, the authors draw upon their everyday experience that gear is an important part of a machine to metaphorically represent the function of a company secretary in a company. Such representation is concomitantly resemiotized into the images of a gear and a machine. Furthermore, the resemiotization inherent in the composition process may also urge authors to create their own semiotics to represent disciplinary concepts in their needs. An example is the group member who used Procreation to draw images that can represent the legal concepts properly instead of exploiting online resources. The examples suggest that resemiotization practice in DMC urges learners to exploit or create semiotic resources to represent disciplinary concepts by “mobiliz[ing] radically different spheres of human experience” (Iedema, 2003, p. 49).

Additionally, the present study indicates that educators should remind students to pay more attention to explaining the content knowledge when incorporating DMC in content teaching. The analysis of the ethnographic data reveals students’ emphasis on appeal to the audience and audience engagement. Besides, some videos begin with engaging popular culture and exciting plots but become relatively bland when introducing legal knowledge. Such practice indicates a few learners’ deemphasis on explaining the legal subject matter. This tendency might be due to students’ consciousness of the attention economy in the digital era. Just as authors must compete for attention in academic publishing through attention-grabbing titles, abstracts or hypes (Hyland, 2023), students try to strategically gain the audience’s attention in the digital world filled with multimedia materials. Given this tendency, educators must draw students’ attention to making good explanations in case that students pay so much attention to attracting the audience’s attention and ignore the ideational aspect of the DMC, when one of the prominent benefits of integrating DMC in content teaching is for students to re-process knowledge proactively.

The present study offers pedagogical implications for writing instructors, law educators, and content teachers. For writing in structors, the widespread use of digital tools and social media expands “writing practice” beyond traditional essays to include digital multimodal composing, allowing learners to remix various genres, semiotic elements, and cultural resources. Therefore, it is essential for writing educators to guide students in navigating these diverse resources to convey their ideas effectively. For law educators, the accessibility of legal knowledge through digital tools highlights the need to develop law graduates’ communicative competence, enabling them to engage not only with legal experts but also with non-specialist audiences, using both textual and multimodal ap proaches. This skill can be cultivated through tasks like creating short popularization videos. Finally, the study shows that engaging with DMC assignments allows students to explore subject content through multimodal communication. Content instructors should consider incorporating DMC in their assignments to foster creative engagement with the material.

The findings of the present study should be approached with caution. Frist, the study’s objective is to provide insights into how DMC can benefit content teaching by examining students’ DMC practices and their reflections on the practice. Consequently, the study places greater emphasis on the “product” rather than the learning process itself. As a result, future studies could devote more attention to the process of learning and composing with DMC in content teaching. It would be particularly intriguing to empirically compare learners using digital multimodal composition (DMC) with those engaging in traditional essay writing in content courses. This comparison could examine their composing processes, student motivation and efficacy, as well as learning outcomes. The purpose of such a comparison would be to reveal the role of DMC in content teaching and determine whether it is necessary to incorporate digital multimodal practices in content courses. Second, it is important to note that the legal studies course involved in the present study is an introductory course focused on company law, where students are primarily expected to develop a basic understanding of legal con cepts. Therefore, the applicability of DMC in advanced legal content courses must be carefully reconsidered. Future studies can explore how the incorporation of DMC affects students’ critical thinking and analytical skills in advanced legal contexts. This could involve preand post-assessments of students’ abilities to engage with and interpret legal texts and case law. Also, future studies can compare the use of DMC approach in advanced legal courses compared to introductory courses. This could involve a comparative study of student outcomes, engagement levels, and comprehension of complex legal concepts. Furthermore, since studying law is inherently intertwined with language learning, it is worthwhile for future studies to explore students’ experiences and performance in content courses across other disciplines. Future research can investigate the application of DMC across various disciplines such as humanities, social sciences, and STEM. This research could assess how DMC enhances student engagement and learning outcomes in different contexts and would allow for an examination of the feasibility of implementing DMC in different disciplinary contexts. Lastly, the present study focuses solely on students’ performance in DMC within content courses. Therefore, it is essential for future research to explore the perspectives of subject teachers on incorporating DMC in these courses. Researchers could conduct qualitative studies involving faculty interviews or focus groups to gather insights into subject specialists’ views on multimodal composition. Understanding faculty concerns and insights will provide valuable perspectives that can help determine the feasibility of integrating DMC in content courses and inform the development of effective teaching strategies.
