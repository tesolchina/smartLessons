This article reports a descriptive study that analyzed the discourse strategies used by Turkish university lecturers when delivering academic content in English. Through non-participant observation of English-Medium Instruction (EMI) lessons delivered by seven lecturers from five universities, a corpus of $^ { 1 3 \mathrm { h } }$ of recorded data was constructed. The lecturers' strategic language behaviors were identified and categorized based on the taxonomy developed by Dornyei and Scott (1995), later elaborated by Sanchez-Garcia, (2019). Corpus-based analysis revealed that the lecturers employed a wide range of discourse strategies, the majority of which were fillers, selfrephrasing, and code-switching. Thematic analysis showed that these discourse strategies offered two chief functions: (ii) to cope with linguistic issues and (ii) to further students' comprehension. The results also revealed that most strategies only have medium communicative potential. This study highlights the necessity and significance of lecturer professional development to enhance the quality of EMI provision through the employment of discourse strategies that warrant greater communicative potential.

# 1. Introduction

In the age of globalization, the implementation of English as a medium of intruction has burgeoned, particularly in higher edu. cation (HE; Dearden & Macaro, 2016; Macaro, Curle, Pun, An, & Dearden, 2018). This language policy is defined as \*the use of the English ln t h dc suet h th ish itl n coie ictio wre the fir ag of thmat f the population is not English (Macaro, 2018, p. 19). Although the swift increase of English-medium instruction (EMI) is observed across the world, universities in Europe have been fertile soil for this phenomenon to achieve the goals of the Bologna Process, particularly in terms of taff and student mobility across the 47 European countries, including Turkey (Doiz, Lasagabaster,& Sierra, 2012; Tsou & Kao, 2017; Wachter & Maiworm, 2014; Yuksel, Altay, & Curle, 2022).

Even though EMI is a relatively new research field, a large body of iterature has evolved over the last 15 years (Macaro et al. 2018). Several areas of EMI have been investigated, such as the perceptions of EMI teachers and students (e.g., Dearden & Macaro, 2016; Galloway & Curle, 2022; Jensen & Thogersen, 2011; Jiang & Zhang, 2019), the impact of EMI on English learning (e.g., Byun et al., 2011; Rogier, 2012), and EMI academic succes (e.g., Altay, Curle, Yuksel, & Soruc, 2022; Curle, uksel, Soruc, & Altay, 2020; Dafouz, Camacho, & Urquia, 2014; Rose, Curle, Aizawa, & Thompson, 2019; Xe & Curle, 2020; Yuksel, Soruc, Altay, & Curle, 2021).

This recent reearch interest in I has gradually shifte towar scrutining MI cassoom discourse ., Duran & Sert, 2019, Gen & Yuksel, 2021; Macaro, 2020; Sahan, Rose, & Macaro, 2021; Sanchez-Garcia, 2019; Shartiely, 2013). In their review of studies on EMI, Curle, Jablonkai, Mittelmeier Sahan, and Vetch (2020) highlight the need for further reearch focusing on classroom interaction and how successul the delivery of content knowledge is. Detailed analysis of EMI clasroom interaction using discourse analysis can help us understand the teaching and learning practices in EMI clases. Portraying what exactl is going on in a classroom can help us reach conclusions about teaching and learning. (Walsh, 2011). Relatively limited research attention has been paid to EMI classroom practices in the Turkish EMI context. Additionall, no studies have explored the strategic language behaviors of EMI lecturers in Turkey. This study, therefore, ills this research gap and makes an original conribution to knowledge by analyzing the use, function, and communicative potential of discourse strategies (DSs) used by content lecturers when delivering academic content through English.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. EMI in Turkey

The use of English Medium Instruction in Turkey can be described in terms of phases of implementation: first-generation and second (also the newest generation) generation of EMI; these correspond to the time before and afer the 21st century (Karakas & Bayyurt, 2019). The firt attempt at EMI i Turkey was made by Robert Collge, founded as an American enterprise in 1863. At the tertiary level, Middle East Technical University was the first state universty that embraced EMI in 1956, which later initiated the provision of EMI in foundation universities. EMI universities of the second generation differ from those of the first in terms of them being the propelling force behind the wide adoption of EMI across Turkey, as well as having a diffrent target student profile they appeal to. In other words, Turkey has changed the direction of the motivation behind EMI programs from giving priority to domestic students to following a policy of internationalization and globalization. Therefore, it can be claimed that the inclusion in the Bologna Process in 2001 led to the second upsurge of EMI in Turkey. Purely English-medium universties were launched, and existing Turkish-medum uniersities started offering partil EMI programs to fulfil the goals set out in the Bologna Process(rik & Arik, 2014) Many studies in the Turkish EMI context focus on attitudinal research, exploring the beliefs of stakeholders. Scholars have reported perceptions and the reported challenges of implementing EMI from the point of view of teachers (e.g., Basibek et al., 2014) and students (e.g, Evans & Morrson, 2011; Kurkgoz, 2009; Macaro & Akincioglu, 2018; Soruc, Altay, Curle, & Yuksel, 2021). The stra tegies to cope with such challenges (e.g., Soruc & Grifiths, 2018) and the required English language skill for EMI students (Inan, Yuksel, & Gurkan, 2012) have also been investigated. However, few studies have en carried out to shed light on classroom discourse used in the Turkish EMI contex see Sahan, 2020; Sahan & Rose, 2021; Sahan et al., 2021). By analyzing lecturer discourse strategies, this study makes a significant contribution to this growing body of EMI research.

# 2.2. Classroom discourse in EMI

The implementation of English as a medium of instruction (which is neither the native language of the instructors nor that of the majority of the students) demands great cognitive and linguistic efort from teachers and students (Hincks, 2010). Studying EMI classroom discourse provides insights into the actualization and operationalization of EMI. Recent studies have focused mainly on clearly distinct discourse practices in EMI classrooms. For example, Sanchez-Garcia (2016) and Thogersen and Airey (2011) inves tigated the effects of the medium of instruction on teachers speech rate and instructional activitie. These studies revealed that lecturers tend to speak more slowly and run over time due to repetitive explanations when teaching through English. The results of studies done by Lo and Macaro (2012) and Yip, Coyle, and Tsang (2007) also indicate that EMI makes the classoom environment less student-entered, tha i ds not involve as much ngotation of meaning and scaffolding as lessons though th irt lnguage do. This micro-analytic investigation of the interaction between teachers and students is an important aspect of EMI discourse.

Recently, a few studies have investigated the discourse used in EMI clases. One of these studies, Sahan and Rose (2021), focused on the functions of ranslanguaging in EMI engineering programs in Turkey. Findings revealed that engineering lecturers and students utilized translanguaging practices for a variety of pedagogical purposes, including presenting new academic content and asking questions related to academic content. In another study, based on the same dataset, Sahan et l. (2021) explored the differences in pedagogial practice according to the type of universit (ie., lit, large, and small. Rults showed that first language (L1) use and lecturer-student interaction varied significantly by university type. More specificall, fewer intances of L1 use and interaction were found in EMI classes at elite universities. Finally, Sahan (2020) examined $^ { 1 4 \mathrm { ~ h ~ } }$ of EMI classroom discourse in Turkey through an English as a Lingua Franca lens. Results revealed that lecturers used the L1 as a means to enact communicative effectivenes.

In another study in the Turkish EMI context, Genc and Yuksel (2021) investigated EMI lecturers' questioning techniques from a social interactionist perspective. They focused on the scope of talk, typology, contingency, and convergence-divergence as laid out in Boyd's (2015) taxonomy. Their descriptive study revealed that questions were most frequently asked in mathematics and engineering courses. EMI lecturers also used mostly text-based, display, and convergent questions, which resulted in restricted interaction in clase. In anther serie f tdies, Duran, urhila, and ert (2019) foused on students vocal and visual practice in relation to Word Search in an EMI university in Turkey. It was observed that the lecturer did not orientate students' word searches. This revealed that content is prioritized over language in this EMI setting. This finding is supported by Duran and Sert (2019), who highlighted that student participation in EMI can be enhanced through resources such as teachers embodiment, tun designs, and displaying preference. Similar to these studies the current study adopts this same type of micro-analytic approach to investigation in order to determine he level of communicativeness of discourse strategies used in EMI lectures

# 2.3. Discourse strategies in EMI

Along with teacher-student interaction, the features of EMI teachers spoken discourse have recently caught the attention of re searchers. Verbal strateies used by EMI content lecturers during their lectures are often researched through the lens of ode-switching, one of the most explore strategies in the literature. It has been found that the extent to which the firt language (L1) is needed in EMI classes i connected to the proficiency level of the students (Macaro, Tian, & Chu, 2020; Pun & Macaro, 2019; Tarnopolsky & Goodman, 2012). Regardles of the amount of code-switching, many studies (e.g., Al Makoshi, 2014; Macaro, 2020; Sanchez-Garcia 2016) reported that switching to the native language creates greater clarity and fulfils many purposes such as elicitation, comprehension, and classroom management. Moreover, Sahan et al. (2021) found that the use of the L1 serves mainly pedagogical purposes such as presenting new content and asking questions related to content. These findings suggest that code-switching is not always an indicator of a language barrier but serves to foster effective communication.

Unlike the investigation of code-switching, only a handful of studies have investigated discourse strategy (DS) use by EMI lecturers. These studies have shown that the most frequently employed strategies by EMI teachers are: prosody, code-mixing, and comprehension check (Azian, Abdul Raof, Ismail, & Hamzah, 2013), repetition, questioning, and code-switching (Shartiely, 2013); literal translation and language switch (Zubaidi, 2014); and retrieval, restructuring, and repetition (Sanchez-Garcia, 2019). Conclusions from these studies noted that DSs could vary deending on the student profile, the discipline taught, and the educational etting. The use of L1 did seem to be prevalent in most of these circumstances.

In addition to the use and function of DSs, Sanchez-Garcia's (2019) research categorized the strategies according to the degree of their communicative potential, namely DSs with less, medium and more communicative potential.

In this study, es communicative potential Ds involved the use f omission (an example from this study corpus is in a research study, detiners . se dto. metme, w yourticy me rerch,  t r  tl the pue of the research in order not to impact their feelings, their ideas, their opinions, right - T5).

The medium communicative potential was the use of filler (e.g., Your level that you are eing exposed to, to many you know like ideas and concepts, you know to much infomatio. 2), use ofall-purose word e., He had he made lo f documentries, espcily onthe oceans, seas, underseas, falan [TR. and so on], lots of documents documentaries - T2) and code-switching.

More communicative potential DSs included six moves such as comprehension checks, self-paraphrasing (e.g., When I say thre, you couldput fourth, fth, sixth. Thris no imit, K BuI sy three times dont meanh oy thr texs in th world, K. .  there is no end. - T6) and restructuring, among others.

Further details and sample excerpts are provided in the Data Analysis section. Building on previous literature (e.g., Sanchez-Garcia 2019), this study examines the discourse strategies (and their communicative potential) employed by lecturers in the Turkish EMI context.

# 3. Methodology

This study addresses the following research questions:

1. Which discourse strategies are employed by university lecturers teaching in an English-medium instruction setting?   
2. What are the uses and functions of the discourse strategies exhibited?   
3. To what extent do the discourse strategies employed serve the lecturers' purpose communicative goal?

# 3.1. Context of the study

Five universtie offering EMI programs constituted the locus of data collction in this study. Of these five universities, U1, U2, and U3 were state universities, while U4 and U5 were foundation universties. The number of EMI programs and international students varied depending on the university. However, on average, $3 5 \%$ of all programs were offered in English, and $8 \%$ of the students came from various countries across the world; this made EMI provision esential as most of those students did not speak Turkish. Different forms of EMI (i., full and partial) were available in U1, U3, and U4. U5 offered only partial EMI programs, in which $3 0 \%$ of the courses were taught in English. U2 delivered all degree programs in (full) EMI. In the Turkish context a full EMI program refers to an a. ademic program of study where all courses are offered in Englis (only), and all teaching and asessment practices are cared out in English (only). On the other hand, partial EMI programs offer a minimum of $3 0 \%$ of their courses in English, and the remaining $7 0 \%$ of the courses are delivered in Turkish. Detailed information about the universities in this study is provided in Table 1.

# 3.2. Participants

Various roles in classrom discourse are attributed to teachers, such as taking control of the communication patterns (Johnson, 1995), controlling the content (Slimani, 1989) and promoting or restraining learning opportunities (Walsh, 2002). EMI lecturers were therefore chosen as the focus of the current study to gain greater insight into EMI classroom discourse. The sample was selected utilizing convenience and purposive sampling (Mackey & Gas, 2012). To ilustrate, participants with dferent teaching backgrounds were chosen from both state and foundation universties to which the researchers had access. Also, the data were collcted from different disciplines (i. ad s soft sciences (fouz et al., 2014) and dfent ecational leels (.. underaduat s graduate) to obtain a comprehensive overview of EMI provision. However, it is worth noting that this study did not primarily aim to investigate the role of the type of university, discipline, level of education, and teacher experience in the investigation of discourse strategies. These are, therefore, possible avenues for future research. The background information of lecturers is presented in Table 2.

# 3.3. Data collection

Non-participant observation was used as the main datacollction procedure in this study in order to not alter/interfre/affect EMI teaching/learning in any way (Curdt-Christiansen, 2020). After obtaining ll the necessary ethical and legal permissions from each universt, as well a getting wrien onsent from allparticipants, university lectures were rcorded. ield ntes were taken by the first author during oservation. These helped the researchers familiarize themselves with the characteristics of each participant'spoken discourse and contextualize classroom talk during transcription. Data obtained from field notes were not analyed in ths study due to space limitations but facilitated the rigorous transcription and contextualization processes. After the observations, a structured interview (see Appendix for interview protocol) was conducted with the lecturers to gain further background information (refer back to Table 2 for participant details).

The recorded lectures analyzed in this study were delivered in the middle of the fall semester, in the 2019-2020 academic year. This was to ensure that by that point in the academic year both lecturers and students had had some experience and were familiar with teaching/learning through EMI. With the recordings of seven EMI lectures, a smallcorpus of EMI language was uilt. The details of the corpus collected are presented in Table 3.

# 3.4. Data analysis

Corpus-based analysis and thematic analysis were the two main methods utilized to identify, analyze, organize, and describe discourse strategies (Ds) exhibited by EMI lecturers. Corpus-based analysis was applied through frequency counts and percentages. Since this method did not provide the finer details of the content of this classroom discourse, thematic analysis was employed to explore the uses, functions, and communicative potential of the DS occurrences. To ensure the validity of coding, six phases of thematic analysis proposed by Braun and Clarke (2006) were followed. This analytic framework includes (a) familiarization with the data (b) generating initial codes, (c) searching for themes, (d) reviewing themes, (e) defining and naming themes, and (f) producing the report. The data were transcribed using basic transcription conventions as the main aim of this study was not to analyze the non-verbal aspects in the clasoom (e., facil expressions and gestures) or prosodic feature ., pitch, accent) excet for the intonation of language use. The transcribed data were coded according to Dornyei and Scot's (1995) inventory list f strategic language devices, which was later elaborated by Sanchez-Garcia (2019). The taxonomy used in this study is presented in Table 4. Reliability of the coding was obtained by researcher triangulation. A teacher-researcher with an MA degree in English language teaching coded $1 0 \%$ of the DS instances as an external reviewer. The consistency percentage was $9 4 \%$ $9 8 \%$ , and $9 7 \%$ for the strategies that have less, medium, and more communicative potential, respectively.

# 4. Results

# 4.1. The most common discourse strategies (RQ1)

To answer the first research question, a corpus-based linguistic analysis was utilized to examine frequency counts. The results revealed that a wide range of discourse strategies was utilized in the delivery of academic content through English. In total, 24 stratey types and 6.321 strategy uses were identified in the spoken discours of the EMI lecturer. Although all lecturers employed similar strategies during thir lecture, evidence f prioritizing certain stratgies over thers was preent. Correspondingly, the incidences and frequencies of the DS types varied greatly in the lecturer language. Nevertheless, one of the Ds was particularly favored by almos all the lectrers this was the use of fllers. This DS constituted more than one-third of the Ds identified i the corpus. Fig. 1 demonstrates the number of discourse strategies used, ranked from the most frequent to the least frequent. These are: use ofillers $( \mathtt { n } = 2 . 6 5 4 )$ , selfrephrasing ${ \bf ( n = 6 4 6 ) }$ , code-switching ${ \bf { ( n = 6 0 2 } }$ ), repetition $( \mathbf { n } = 5 7 9 )$ , use of all-purpose words $( \mathbf { n } = 4 6 0 )$ , retrieval ${ \bf ( n = 3 2 4 ) }$ , repair $[ \mathfrak { n } =$ 267), response ${ \bf ( n = 2 2 0 ) }$ , restructuring $( \mathtt { n } = 1 1 9 )$ , comprehension check ${ \bf \mathit { \Omega } } ( { \bf n } = 1 0 9 )$ , omission $( \mathbf { n } = 7 0 $ , approximation $\left( \mathbf { n } = 3 8 \right)$ , message abandonment $\left( \mathbf { n } = 3 7 \right)$ , asking for repetition $\mathbf { \tilde { n } } = 3 5 \mathbf { \check { \rho } }$ , appeal for help $( \mathbf { n } = 3 2 )$ , asking for clarification $\left( \mathbf { n } = 2 5 \right)$ , foreignizing $( \mathbf { n } = 2 2 )$ circumlocution $\left( \mathbf { n } = 2 1 \right)$ , similar-sounding words $( \mathbf { n } = 1 6 )$ ) asking for confirmation ${ \bf ( n = 1 3 }$ , literal translation $( \mathtt { n } = 1 2 )$ , word coinage $\mathbf { n } =$ 12), interpretive summary $( \mathtt { n } = 4 )$ , own accuracy check $( \mathtt { n } = 4 )$

Since the different trategies require various formulations of language (ie., at the word-level, phrase-level, and clause-level), the number of words required to utter the strategies also varie. Therefore, the frequency percentages of the DSs were also calculated based on the trategy occurrences per 1000 words. It was found that the lecturers uttered 254 words to exhibit strategic language behaviors every 1000 words. This reiterated the finding of the pervasiveness of DS use in EMI lecturers' spoken discourse.

# 4.2. The use and function of the strategies used (RQ2)

When the strategies employed were examined following their use and function using thematic analysis, it became evident that one strategy would offer plenty of functions, while one function was also enacted using numerous strategy types. Therefore, the uses and functions of the DSs that each lecturer opted for varied widely. Nevertheles, three primary uses emerged from the analysis: (i) abandoning the linguisti plan, (ii)narrowing or extending the meaning with an altenative plan, and (i) fulilling th initial plan successfully. An example of each use is provided below in Excerpts 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Excerpt 1: Abandoning the linguistic plan   

<html><body><table><tr><td>177</td><td></td><td>I have a question. Do I have to interview people?</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>S8</td><td>Yes. I mean ry  nrew, tot o ring the, er, scoure, the anguags of ther peple. hen how w will. ets try to hnde, ets try to</td></tr><tr><td>178</td><td>T1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>interview other people.</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></table></body></html>

Excerpt 2: Narrowing or extending the meaning   

<html><body><table><tr><td> 70</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>T2</td><td>So but it means also that there is a kind of err react kind of resistance right, from that type of micro-level of everyday life.</td></tr></table></body></html>

Excerpt 3: Fulfilling the initial plan successfully   

<html><body><table><tr><td>275</td><td>T5</td><td>You can be a positivist and systematic way of designing your research. You have a very, you know like, you can use numbers describe your particular, you know like, phenomena.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"></td></tr></table></body></html>

As the excerpts presented above suggest, the lecturers were inclined to employ such strategies when they encountered language. related challenges. For example, in Excerpt 1, T1 left his uterance unfinished while explaining the significance of interviews in that discipline. Nevertheles it can be inferrd that anguage-latd dificultiesuch as lexical retrieval may be the underlying cause that led to dropping the message. In Excerpt 2, T2 could not retrieve the word he was seeking. When he realized this, he continued with an alternative lexical item. This suggests that the target meaning may have been narrowed or extended through the use of an alternate word. In Excerpt 3, T5 prominently faced obstacles regarding the retrieval of a word or phrase. She thus used a fillr to gain time to accommodate her thinking process. When she realized that she could not compensate for this linguistc barer in her discourse, she abandonedthe intial linguistic ptern to then go on to restructure the entece. Therefore, it can be concluded that thes functioned as a manner of coping with linguistic/fluency issues.

There were umerous occurrnc of trates beig utilized  oost the efetivenssf contet dliery. cifically, repetition, self-rephrasing, and confirmation checks were frequently used to enhance students' comprehension. This indicates that the employment of DSs in these EMI classes went beyond simply compensating for lack of proficiency. An example of this is given in Excerpt 4.In this excerpt, T6 uses multiple DSs to help her students comprehend the topic and thereby enhancing their learning.

Excerpt 4: The use of DS to further comprehension   

<html><body><table><tr><td>133</td><td>T6</td><td>I&#x27;m protecting my ideas to classroom. That&#x27;s also called protection.e</td><td>OK. What about in Turkish? What is protection in Turkish?

Besides the abovementioned functions, other discourse strategy types were found to be frequently employed for various purposes. These DSs are presented in Table 5 alongside the functions they served in the lecturers'spoken discourse.

4.3. Communicative potential of discourse strategies used by EMI lectures (RQ3)

Having established that certain discourse strategies enhanced communication in the clasroom (see RQ2), the DSs used by lecturers were then analyzed based on the extent to which they serve the communicative goal of the ecturers. Thre categories emerged from the data: namely, less, medium, and more communicative potential.

Discourse strategies with less communication potential (e.g., message abandonment and omission) failed to deliver the target message completely or hindered the continuation of the conversation. This took place 141 times in the corpus. The DSs with medium communicative potential(e.g, use of fllers,all-purpose words, similar-sounding words) were regarded as in-between' strategies as the message was delivered successflly, however with the substantial influence of other languages and/or by extending or severely narrowing the meaning. This communicative category constituted the vast majorit of the DSs (3.795 occurrence) in the corpus. The last category, strategies with more communicative potential, allowed lecturers to recognize the most convenient, straightforward linguistic path forward in order to deliver the intended message completely and coherently. Despite the plenitude of strategy types in this category, these were not the most prevalely utilized strategies in thecorus (i.e., 2.385 occurrences). The frequency of each DS category within the corpus is presented in Table 6.

# 5. Discussion

# 5.1. The most commonly used discourse strategies

Concerning the first research question, 24 discourse strategy types and 6.321 strategy uses by seven EMI lecturers were identified in the 13-h corpus. This implies that teaching distinct academic disciplines through a second language requires a wide range of discourse strategies to be utilized in order to foster comprehension. The frequency of these strateies was also shown to be in accordance with the lecturers' linguistic repertoire. When the number of words that contained DSs was calculated, it was found that around $2 5 \%$ of the spoken corpus was uttered to display discursive strategies. This study, therefore, provides further evidence of the indispensability of DSs in the language used by EMI lecturers (Sanchez-Garcia, 2019).

As for the distinctiveness of DSs found in EMI classroom discourse, our findings were both similar and diferent from the existing literature. The overall principal finding revealed that fller, self-rephrasing, and code-switching are the most used strategies in this corpus. Spifially filler words were found to be a broady inclusive angage tool, a finding that is consistent with ther studies e., Sanchez-Garcia, 2016; Shartiely, 2013). The finding concerning code-switching is aso in line with the results of some previous studies (e.g., Azian et al, 2013; Shartiely, 2013; ubaidi, 2014) but contradictory to Sanchez-Garcia's (2016) results. This may be atributed to the language policy of the EMI universtie from which the data was colected. Furthermore, the instances of slf-rephrasing in this study were higher than those in other studies. This discrepancy may be related to the fact that self-rephrasing was subsumed into repetition by some scholars in previous data analysis (Azian et al., 2013; Sanchez-Garcia, 2019) as these two strategies are similarly formulated. This highlights a need for further research differentiating these nuances.

# 5.2. The uses and functions of discourse strategies used

The second research question sought to determine the uses and functions of the discourse strategies employed by EMI lecturers. Results demonstrated that DSs were predominantly used to perform two chief functions: (i) to overcome language-related problems and (i) to foster comprehension (and, accordingly, foster communication). Regarding the former, which was the case for most of the strategy occurrences, this study provides evidence of the complex nature of EMI. Teaching through English is not a simple translation of content into English (Macaro et al., 2018); it demands high cognitive and linguistic effrt (Hincks, 2010; Sanchez-Garcia, 2016) Despite this, the lecturers sated that they had not rceived any form of EMI training. Such training would have highlighted these sorts of demands to the lecturers and equipped them with the necessary skills to deal with such demands. The ignificance and necessit of such training in the Turkish EMI context have also been highlighted in previous studies (Genc & Yuksel, 2021).

Regarding the later function (i.e., the promotion of comprehension), this finding corroborates with the notion proposed by Nakatani and Goh (2007); that the employment of these discourse strategies goes beyond mere compensation for lack of proficiency. However, it is worth noting that although repetition and slf-rephrasing were the most common DSs inthis corpus, thetotal instances of sch te wr owe than thos fths, flilling th tion f voig lanua isue. hs fining r from Azian et al.'s (2013) and Shartiely's (2013) studies, which found a prevalence of the use of questions used specifically for comprehension checks. This incongruence in results might be explained by class sze as these studies focused on large classes, which may have led to EMI lecturers in those contexts using questions and rephrasing more frequently in order to manage big groups. Nevertheles, this study suggests that the lecturers exhibited great effrt t aid students comprehension of academic content by using DSs. This endeavor also indicates that lecturers' language proficiency shapes content learning, as Doiz et al. (2012) claim. Hence, these results provide further support for the pertinence of lectrer training in how to foster content comprehension with the help of the systematic use of meaningful and purposeful Discourse Strategies.

As wellas the primary uses and functions of DSs discussed above, various ways of using DSs and motivations for using DSs were identfied in this study. Particull, the function f ode-swtching , failitating studets understanding, aelling the concet in the native language, coping with lexical problems) were mostly found to be in accordance with previous studies (e.g., Al Makoshi, 2014; Azian et al., 2013; Macaro et al., 2020; Sahan & Rose, 2021; Sanchez-Garcia, 2016; Shartiely, 2013; Zubaidi, 2014). This was a sign that code-switching i a typical feature of the speech of a bilingual speaker rather than a sign of linguisic deficiency (Wei & Lin, 2019). Furthermore, since code-switching in this study was found to be a language too used to equip students with additional cognitive support, these findings provide further evidence for the notion that L1 use is a scaffolding strategy linked to sociocultural theory (Garcia & Wei, 2014; Sanchez-Garcia, 2016).

# 5.3. The communicative potential of EMI discourse strategies

The third research question focused on the degre to which the DSsallowed EMI lecturers to achieve their communicative goals in teaching. It was found that $6 0 \%$ of strategy occurrences had medium communicative potential. When compared to the study by Sanchez-Garcia (2019), these results are not aligned. Sanchez-Garcia (2019) found these strategies to have more communicative potential $( 6 8 \% )$ . This might be because the researcher did not include the use of filers in this clasification, yet filler words/expressions seemed to be paramount, as mentioned above.

Additionally, the scarcity of interactional strategies in this study may stem from the fact that EMI lecturers were the ones who constituted the majority of the classom discourse (i.. students rarely spoke). This result confirms findings i studies such as that in Genc and Yuksel (2021), Yip et al. (2007) and Lo and Macaro (2012) regarding the teacher-centeredness in EMI classes.

Finally, code-switching is the other factor that may have decreased the communicative potential of this corpus. As Smit (2019) and Macaro (2020) assert,code-switching and ther similar stragies that ocur due t1 interference (i.., foreignzing or word coinage) may lose the intended communicative potential when there are students in the classroom who do not share the same linguistic background. This was indeed the case in this study since most of the classe (except two in a partial EMI program) included inter. national students. However, this situation was distinctive, especiall in the classrom language performance of one lecturer. This indicated that even though lecturers relied on the same types of trategies, they favored the same DSs in different universty grades. Therefore, the communicative potential in their lessons varied.

# 6. Conclusion and pedagogical implications

Despite the limitations of this research, such as only observing the lessons once and not using a retrospective analysis tol (i., stimulated reall; s Aire, 2015), this study has pedagogicl implications. First, findns emerging from the analyss o EI lecturers spoken discourse imply that it is crucial for EMI lecturers to be conscious of their language use for the sake of EMI achievement (Macaro, 2020). Through language, lecturers are powerful agents in the processof facilitating a student's learning process and, therefore, content comprehension and aqusition. By adopting more conscious discoursestrategie, lecturer can meet the needs of the learning moment as well as create learning opportunities for students (Walsh, 2011).

Findings also showed that EMI lecturers encountered many linguisic challenges due to a lack of fluency while teaching academic content through English, particularly related to lexis. This study, therefore, proposes continuing professonal development discourse strategy training for EMI lecturers. Learning to use discourse strategies eficiently might lessen the lecturer's experienced language. related dificulties. Related to this was the finding of a lack of the frequent use of DSs that promote a positive learning environment due to lecturer linguistics barriers. This study, therefore, bolsters the argument for the need for further MI lecturer training, which should be aimed at assting lecturers to make better us of numerous inguistic resources that can help shape and positively nhance thir students leing proces (Walsh & Li, 2013). There is aed for further rech into the chability of these discourse strategies in EMI contexts and a measurement of the effectiveness and effct on student learning outcomes of such explicit lectrer training and instruction. Finall, longitudinal studies tracking strategy use over time would provide further inight into the long-term effects of explicit discourse strategy use that exploit the more communicative potential.
