University writing   
Communicative purpose   
Assignment types   
Genres

Several previous researchers have developed taxonomies of the written genres produced by students in university content classes. These studies have often described the communicative purposes of university writing genres, with the implication that these categories are well-defined in terms of purpose. However, even a casual inspection of university student texts reveals that many texts perform multiple communicative purposes, and that there is considerable variation among texts within the same genre.

Motivated by such observations, the present study seeks to empirically analyze the communicative characteristics of texts in five university writing genres: essays, critiques, case studies, methodology recounts, and explanations. The study is based on analysis of 308 student texts, extracted from 3rd year students in the BAWE corpus. Each text is coded for its communicative purposes, including the possibility that a given text can realize multiple purposes to differing extents. The results reveal that there is considerable variation in major purpose among texts within a genre, and that most texts contain more than one communicative purpose. However, these patterns differ across genres. For example, $5 5 . 7 \%$ of essays combine two communicative purposes, while $5 6 . 1 \%$ of critiques combine three communicative purposes. The specific combination of purposes also varies for each genre.

# 1. Introduction

Writing scholars and instructors all generally agree that students are required to write many different types of texts, or different GENREs, as part of a normal university education. These texts must accomplish a range of different communicative purposes, with communicative purposes being defined as the primary goal and intention of anyone involved in an act of communication on a given occasion' (Chandler & Munday, 2016). Composition textbooks, for example, distinguish among the communicative purposes' of argumetatio, narration, analysis, ynthsis, and proposing a study (ee, , Lusford et a., 2017; Gln, 2016). Simrly, researh articles have described the characteristics of exository, critical, armentative, syntheizing, informative, exploratory and persuasive communicative purposes in university writing (see, e.g., Bridgeman & Carlson, 1984; Rose, 1983; Melzer, 2005).

Over the last decade, two in-depth studies exploring the communicative purposes of university written genres have ben carried out to provide the foundation for large-scale corpora of student writing: the Michigan Corpus of Upper-Level Student Papers (MICUSP; Romer & ODonnell 2011) and the British Academic Wrien English (BAWE) Corpus (Gardner & Nesi, 2013) After cllecting the texts for each corpus, the corpus-compilers grouped assignments in terms of genres (and/or genre families) and then described these groupings in terms of their communicative purposes.

The MIcusP corpus was organized in terms of seven broad genre categories, with each genre encompassing more specific assignment types. The genre of creative writing, for example, includes narrative writing, poetry, and drama scripts (Romer & O Donnell 2011, p. 170). Each broad genre category was associated with a diffrent rhetorical purpose, as shown in Table 1.

The BAWE Corpus is organized into 13 high-level categorie, referred to as genre familie, shown in Table 2. These genres families are described generaly for their social functions and then ach one is decribed in detal for it particular social purposes Similar to the McusP corpus, each genre family contains specificassignment types (i this case referred to as specific genres). For example, case study encompasses assignments such as company report, organization analysis, or patient report (Nesi & Gardner, 2012, p. 37)

Many other previous studies of university student writing have also attempted to catalog the diffrent genres that students write in university classes and to describe their communicative purposes. However, a comparison of these studies shows that there is virtually no consensus on the inventory of particular genres or even on the number of ifferent student writing genres. For example, Bridgeman and Carlson (1984) and Romer and O'Donnell (2011) identified fewer than 10 genre categories, while Tasker (2019) and Horowitz (1986) identify more than 30 genres.

Given that researchers do not agree on the set of genres that exist in university writing, it is perhaps not surprising that their communicative descriptions of the same genre can also vary considerably. For example, case study' is a genre identified by many researchers, but its defining characteristics range widely, as the definitions presented below illustrate:

- A case study \*consists f analysis and presentation of a case stuation; enerally it includes discussion of how a particular isue was addressed (sic) (Hale et al., 1996, p. 11);   
- A case study is a "description of a particular case, often multifaceted, with recommendations or suggestions for future action (Nes) & Gardner, 2012, p. 41);   
- A case study \*use class learning/theory to solve a problem rather than to explain how a given theory fit a body of data" (Horowitz, 1986, p. 451).

Our discussion up to this point raises the question of precisely what agenre is, and in fact, there is surprisingly litle agreement among researchers on a technical definition of this term. Nesi and Gardner (2012), for example, dedicate a chapter (p. 21-54) to the description of the genre families in BAwE, but their operationalization of these genre families is limited to \*categories that are essentilly abstractions from specific assgnments' (p.22). Within systemic functional linguisics, Martin and Rothery (1986) argue that genre "reers to the tged purposeful social proces through which culture s realized in a language'. Hymes (1974, p. 61), on the other hand, agued that genres often coincide with peech events but must be treated analyticall independent of them'. From an EAP perspective, Swales (1990, p. 58) defines genres as \*a class of communicative events, the members of which share some set of communicative purposes'. We return to the ssue of definitions of genre in the conclusion. But at this point, we should clarify the discussion by noting that we are using gre as a general cover term to referto different type r cateorie of student writing. In fact. our use of the term her is at odds wth the technical distinction between genes and reisters preented in our previous reearch see Biber & Conrad, 2019; especially Chapters 1-3). That i, ollowing Biber and Conrad's (2019) framework the different types of student assignments are register categories. However, for our purposes here we will use the term GEn fllowing the term adopted by the compilers of the corpus used in this study (BAwE). Regardes of the term used (register or genre), the three important background facts that matter for our purposes in this study are:

1. the existence of multiple types or categories of student writing (regardes of whether we refer to those categories as 'genres', 'tasks', or 'registers'); 2. the extreme degree of disagreement among researchers concerning the set of possible genres in this discourse domain, and 3. the similar disagreement among researchers concerning the communicative characteristics of specific genres.

This state-of-the-art is not at all unique to student writing research. In fact, these same methodological isues arise in any study attempting to empiricll document the full t of text categories (genres or registers in a discourse domain. A reent example of this type is the study of register variation on the web (se Biber & Egbert, 2018)?. Despite decades of research carried out by numerous scholars, there is sill no consensus regarding the set of registers found on the web (e.g., blogs, encyclopedia artice, FAQs) or the communicative characteristics of these particular registers. A similar research situation confronts any researcher hoping to determine the set of registers in any other discourse domain (e.g., consider the domains of news reportage, academic writing, conversational interaction).

One response to this research situation would be to question the validity of existing categorizations, and to even question the enterprisef describing paers of register variation in a discourse domain. Howeer, in a series of recent books and papers .g., ber & Egbert, 2018; Biber, Egbert & Keller, 2020) we argue for an altenative research approach referred to as the Text-Linguistc (TxtLx)

approach to register variation: embracing the fact that register distinctions are fluid, with fuzzy boundaries and extensive internal variation, and then developing empirical methods to describe the nature of that continuous space of variation.

This research approach has been developed in a series of recent TxtLx papers (see Biber, Egbert, Keler, & Wizner, 2021a; Biber, Egbert, Keller, & Wizner, 2021b; Biber et al., 2020). One starting assumption of the aroach is the recognition that texts in aregister do not necessrily ll share exactly the same communicative characterisics. In the Txtlx aproach, there has always been an explicit recognition that texts within a register can vary with respect to their lexico-grammatical characteristics (see, e.g., Biber, 1988). The innovation in these more recent studies is to extend that perspective to the description of communicative purposes and other situational characteristics. In other words, registers are not necessarily well-delimited with respect to situational or linguistic characteristics. Rather, there is the theoretical possbilit of situational (as well as linguistic) variation among texts within each register category, and empirical analyses should explore the nature of such variation.

Earlier TxtLx studies (like Biber, 1988) documented the patterns of linguistic variation within register categories. And more recently, that approach has been extended to situational characterisics, analyzing the situational variation among texts within a register. For example, Biber et al. (2020) show that some registers - like online news articles - exhibit an extensive range f diversity in the communicative purposes of texts, while other registers - like web encyclopedia articles - are relatively homogeneous and well-delimited with respect to the communicative purposes of texts. Similarly, Biber et al. (2021a, 2021b) show that even a commonplace register like face-to-face onveration can have extensive variation in the communicatie characteristics of interactions.

By extension, this new research perspective led to the exploration of a second related possbility: that a single text might be characterized by multiple communicative purposes. For example, Biber et al. (2021a) show how many conversational interactions combine two or more different communicative purposes e., describing/explaining the past, figuring-things-out, situation-deendent commentary, and joking around). Similarly, Biber et al.(2020) show how individual web news reports can combine communicative purposes like persuading the reader, entertaining the reader, giving advice or recommendations, and narrating past events.

Our goal in the present paper is to explore the application of this research perspective in the domain of universty student writing, investigating empirically the ways in which texts within a genre family vary in their communicative purposes. The immediate background to this research question is our own first-hand experience working with university student papers over the years, where we noticed cases of extensive communicative variation among papers written as exemplars of a single genre. Perhaps the clearest example ofthis typeis the diverst among student papers within the gnre of esas illstrated by the following thre ecerts taken from the BAWE corpus. It is clear from the prose itself that the authors are motivated by different communicative purposes: the purpose of excerpt  is to argue for a point f view, the purpose of excerpt is to compare thre areas f psychology, and the urpose of excerpt 3 is to analyze the object of study.

Excerpt 1 (0320i).

Therefore, in thi essy I wil fous on thre deate rounddlinqueny mong girs nd nvestigte the considtions frming the.  il argue for the recognition of 'genuine' female behaviour. Excerpt 2 (0408f). This esay compares thesocial polies of Hitler's Nazi government with the New Deal policies of Roosevelt's Democratic government from 1932 to 1937. Excerpt 3 (0202c). In thisesay I shallattempt to give a brif outine of the sGP and its problems before analysing how serious these problems are in today's context.

In our experience, such variation is commonplace, and directly challenges the preconception that all texts within a genre share the same communicative purposes (as ilustrated by the definitions presented in Tables 1 and 2). As noted above, one reaction to this possility would be to question the overall validit of studies of genre or register variation in the universty context. In contrast, we adopt the opposite research perspective here: embracing the theoretical possibility of communicative variation among texts within genres, and then developing and applying empirical research methods to describe and compare the ways in which texs within a genre vary.

The goal of the present study is to explore these theoretical possbilities in the domain of university student writing. As described above, our prior experiences led us to believe that there i extensive communicative variation among texts within a university written genre, in addition to multiple communicative purposes accomplished within individual student papers. The reset study investigates these possibilities empiricall, to describe a) the extent to which texts within a single student writing genre serve different communicative purposes, and b) the extent to which individual texts tend to employ multiple communicative purposes.

In addition, we explore a third source of variation in the way that student writing genres are realized: the possibilit that the same genre might be relized in differing ways across ifferent discilinary groups. This ossbilit has be rased before but neer explored systematicall through a large-scale corpus investigation. For example, Braine (1989) suggests that instructors from diffrent departments might interpret the goals of the same genre in diferent ways (e.g., essays in life sciences could have a different communicative purpose than essays in humanities). More recently, Bruce (2010) explored this idea by focusing on the genre of essays in English and Sociology (finding that most sociology essays relied on explanation, whilesays in English favored explanations combined with narrative recounts).

In the present paper, we seek to empirically analyze the nature and the extent of such variation in a large corpus of universty student writing from content courses in three general disciplinary groups. Our goal is not to propose a new classification scheme for university writing corpora, or to validate previous clasification frameworks. Rather, our goal is to explore the extent to which texts within genres vary in terms of communicative purpose. Specificall, we analyze student texts from five common genres (essays, critiques, case studies, methodology recounts, and explanations) as they are realized in three major academic disciplines (arts and humanities, social sciences, life and physical sciences'), to investigate the following research questions:

1. To what extent is there variation within each genre for the major communicative purpose of student-writing texts?

2. To what extent do individual student papers from each genre combine multiple communicative purposes within a single text? a. how many purposes are there? b. what combinations of purposes are especially prevalent for each genre?   
3. Is the same genre realized in the same ways across disciplines?

# 2. Methods

Our study is based on analysis of a selection of texts from the BAwE Corpus, which contains successfl student writing collected at

four British universities over the years of 2004-2007 (Heuboeck, Holmes, & Nesi, 2010). We focused on five major genres - essays.   
critiques, case studies, methodology recounts, and explanations - written by 3rd year students (the final year of undergraduate ed.   
ucation), with the expectation that students would have had maximal oportunity to solidify their knowledge of these genres by then.   
Table 3 shows the breakdown of 3rd year texts in BAWE by genre.

We coded each text i all five genres in the corus for its communicative purposes. This methodological approach differs from much previous research in two respects: 1) it involves analyzing the communicative characteristics of each individual text, rather than the general communicative characteristics of a genre, and 2) the end goal is to characterize texts communicatively, rather than to classify texts into genre categories. Despite these differences, we found it useful to begin with the communicative purposes identified in taxonomies of student writing genres, developed by researchers who surveyed or interviewed university instructors (Eblen, 1983; Bridgeman & Carlson, 1984), examined writing prompts (Hale et al., 1996; Horowitz, 1986; Zhu, 2004), or classfied the writings produced by students (Romer & 0'Donnel, 2011; Gardner & Nesi, 2013). Drawing on these studies, our initial taxonomy contained six communicative purposes: to compare, to narrate a past event, to give a procedural recount, to narrate a personal event, to explain and to propose. We then proceeded through several rounds ofpilot coding, revising and extending this initial framework as needed to account for the communicative purposes that we observed in student texts. The first coding pilot was conducted with 20 texts and two coders. Through this initial pioting, we noticed that a number of communicatie purposes (to describe, to argue, and to express ossbility) were missing from our intil framework. At each round of piloting, we coded 20 new papers and used the discussion to refin the definitions for each purpose identified. In the end, we developed a comprehensive set of purposes found in university writing tasks.

It is worth emphasizing that our goal was to develop a framework to describe the communicative purposes of student texts - regardlessof the genre of those texts. Thus, this framework is not a proposed genre-classfication scheme for university writing, but a way of analyzing the communicative purposes of each text. The final taxonomy contains nine communicative purposes: to argue, to compare, to describe ngible object, to expn/nalyze, to give person dice tonarat  esonal event to give a proceurl recount, to narrate, and to propose/express possibility.

Our defintion of decription differs from that of previous studies. In our frmework to descrbe refers specifically to the descriptions of tangible objects, while to explain accounts for descriptions of abstract objects of study (i.., theories, historical events, etc) and analysis of different concepts. Table 4 provides a description of each of the communicative purposes used in the coding, including examples and points of contrast with other purposes.

An additional issue in the development of the communicative purposes taxonomy was to account for the possibility that an individual text could have more than one purpose. Previous studies examining hybrid texts used a continuous scale to account for this variation in purpose within each text (Biber et al., 2020). In the present study, we adopted a more eficient methodological approach to achieve similar analytical goals: recognizing the distinction between the 'major purpose' of a text and other 'minor purposes. We operationally defined the 'major communicative purpose as the primary, overarching goal or function of a text or what students are doing in that text, and minor purposes as any other secondary goals or functions that students incorporated into a text. Every text was coded for a single major purpose. In addition, a text could optionally have one or more minor purposes, although there was no requirement that a text should have a minor purpose. For example, the excerpt bellow illustrates an instance where the student explicitly articulates this idea that a text has a major purposeaccompanied by minor purposes. As we can se, the major purpose of the excerpt is to argue, but in order to accomplish this goal the student has to explain these conditions and criteria, which are being evaluated.

Excerpt 4 (03111).

In this esay I aim to citially examine citeria that claim to define science and discuss what conditions such criteria must have in order to be a satisfactory definition.

Having established this final coding framework, two of the authors evaluated the inter-rater reliability of the rubric in Table 4 by coding 40 texts that had not been used in piloting rounds before. This resulted in an inter-rater agreement of $8 0 \%$ (Cohen's Kappa .68). Disagrements were disussed until the authors reched a consensus in the clssficatio of the texts. Unfortunatly, it i diffiult to compare this agreement to previous studies because, to the best of our knowledge, no previous study has reported inter-rater agreement rates relating to the classification of texts.

Subsequently, each of the 308 texts in our corpus was coded for its major purpose and any minor purposes, allowing for quantitive comparisons between and within genre categories. In order to code the major and minor communicative purposes of these assign. ments, each text was read to determine the overall goal and other secondary functions that were used to achieve this overall goal. Typicall, the major purpose was evident in the introduction, reflected throughout the sections of the paper, and revisited in the conclusion. Texts were skimmed in their entirety to identify any additional minor purposes of specific sections, used to support or accomplish the major purpose of the paper. For example, a paper with the major purpose of to argue might include a section that explains' technical considerations to provide evidence for the argument being put forth It i worth noting that our classfication did not rely on statements of purposes or keywords, since many texts did not have an explicit statement of purpose. ll texts of university writing that we examined had a clear major purpose.

In order to answer research question three, which examines purpose variation across disciplinary groups, we analyzed only the category f esay' as this is the most common genre category in BAwE. In addition, essy is the most widely distributed genre across disciplinary groups. Table 5 details the number of essays in each disciplinary group. It is worth noting that BAwE originall distinguishes between Life and Physical Sciences, but we decided to join these two disciplinary groups in order to have a representative number of texts for this discipline.

# 3. Results and discussion

# 3.1. Purpose variation within genres

The first step in the analysis was to investigate whether the texts within a genre showed variation in their major communicative purposes. As Table 6 shows, esays, critiques, and casestudies show extensive variation in the major purpose f texts, to the extent that any generalization about the typical communicative purposes of those genres would be suspect. In addition, those three genres show considerable overlap in major purpose. In contrast, methodology recounts and explanations are beter discriminated in terms of their communicative purposes: the majority of methodology recount texts give a procedural recount, and the large majority of explanation texts provide explanations.

The gere f eys, citiques, and caetdie all combine texts wth different maor purposes.Many of th tex i all thee genes have the major purpose of to explain, and many other texts in al thee genres have the major purpose of toargue. Table 6 shows that there is extensive variation in communicative purpose among texts within these genres, as well as a very high degre of overlap in communicative purpose across the three genres.

In the case of essays, we see a primary divide between essays that are primarily argumentative (to argue) $( 4 7 . 3 \% )$ and essays that are primarily informational (to explain) $( 4 8 . 5 \% )$ . Excerpts 5 and 6 illustrate this distinction. In essays that explain, students reproduce knowledge or display familiarity with a topic (e.g., excerpt 5), whil in argumentatie essays, students give their own point of view about a topic (e.g., excerpt 6).

Excerpt 5 (0200f).

Similar to esays, citiques are also divided between texts that argue and texts that explain. As we can see i the two excerpts below, critiques that have to ague as their maor purpose ealuate the object f study. In the case f excerpt 7, we see a ssessment of Gorge Moore's novel, Esther Waters. I contrast,citiques that have to explain as the major purpose focus on providing a detailedaccount of a concept or theory. This is illustrated in excerpt 8, in which the student demonstrates understanding of a trade theory.

Excerpt 7 (3003d)

George Moore experienced many problems with thecirculating libraries nd publishers when seeking to publish his novel Esther Waters. ..) I would like to ss wh Esther Waters intilr ws so shockingto its oil reders, and whi hs to do pifically wth its heroine. Excerpt 8 (0111a).

The Heckscher-Ohin model i one such model, and has proved a popular reference point for the development of intenational trade theory and policy. I will explain the model and its assumptions and link them to the robustness of the theorem.

Case studies are also divided between two major communicative purposes, to explain and to propose. Case studies that have to explain as their major purpose are similar to the examples of essays and critiques (excerpts 8 and 5) with this same purpose. That is, students analyze the specifics of acase provided by the professor. On the other hand, in case studies that have to propose as a major purpose, the student makes a plan for the improvement of the topic of study, as we can se in excerpt 9, where the student i proposing a change in a business plan.

Interestingly, methodology recounts and explanations are the only genres where most texts share the same major communicative purpose. In the case of methodology recounts, a genre mainly composed of laboratory reports, most texts $( 7 7 . 2 \% )$ have to give a procedural recount as the major purpose. In this type of text, the writer reports an experiment that was conducted as part of a class assignment, as excerpt 10 illustrates.

Excerpt 10 (3091f).

The aim of this rport i to investigate the ynamic properties of a mild stel late. umerical and experimental methods for detmining the dynamic behaviour will be investigated and conclusions drawn from the results obtained.

Surprisingly, though, about $2 0 \%$ of the texts from this genre have other communicative purposes, showing that even an apparently narrowly defined genre like methodology recount permits variation in communicative purpose.

The genre of explanations is the most constrained, with $8 6 . 9 \%$ of the texts having the purpose of explaining, combining information from different sources to demonstrate knowledge of a topic. In this case, there is essentially an equivalence between the name of the genre category and the communicative purpose, illustrated in excerpt 11.

Excerpt 11 (0112f).

This essay aims to outine the major matenal effect enes, their roles in embryo development and how ther ocalistion is esentil for the production of the correct C.elegans body plan.

# 3.2. Number of purposes within texts from each genre

Our second research question investigates the extent to which individual student papers from each genre combine multiple communicative purposes i.., including the major communicative purpose as well as other minor purposes). In the previous section we examined variation in major purpose. In ths section, we investigate how different communicative purpose are employed to differing extents across genres. Given the variability in major communicative purpose described in the preceding section, it is perhaps not surprising that our analysis shows that most student papers in al five genres combine multiple communicative purposes. As Table 7 shows, most texs across genres combine at east two communicative purposes. Critiques combine even more purposes within the same text, with the majority of critiques combing three or more purposes.

Although most texts from all genres combine more than one purpose, it turns out that the particular combinations of communi cative purpose difer across genres. In the following sub-sections, we consider each genre family in turn.

# 3.2.1. Essays

The most frequent combinations of purposes in essays include to explain and to argue. Essays that combine these two purposes require students to critcally evaluate n object f stud, and this assment of the object f stud is aompanied by an analysis of the object. This pattern of essays results in a great number of texts combining to explain and to argue, sometimes together with other purposes, such as to compare and to narrate. These other purposes add to the explanation of the topic of study or are used to give evidence to the argument of the paper.

Excerpt 12 exemplifies the combination of to explain and to argue in essays. In this text, the student is building an argument - that Braudel did not contradict the views of the Annales - but in order to do so they analyze the views of the journals before and during Braudel's time.

Excerpt 12 (0061j).

The Annales d'histire economique et sociale was launched in 1929 by two collagues t the Universit of Strasbourg Lucien Febvre and Marc Bloch (..). In 1956, afer the death of Lucien Febre, Fenand Braudel became editor of the renamed Annales: economies, societes, civiliatio . hi ewilk  t de th t  thl, nd  to sos to whether the 'Age of Braudel' conserved or contradicted original Annales historiography.

Fig. 1 also shows that a considerable number of esays have only one purpose (to explain). In these texts, students display fa miliarity with a topic without adding their views in relation to this topic i.. arguing). Ecerpt 13 llustrates how to explain appears in essays. In this excerpt, the student shows command of a topic - new institutionalism, but the student does not argue in favor or againt this topic nor adds comparison to the analysis.

Fig. 1. Purpose combinations in essays.

E.U. Neo institutionalism.

Another frequent combination in this genre is to explain and to compare. In texts with this pattrn, the author explains a topic in light of two concepts or objects of study. Excerpt 14 exemplifies how these two purposes appear together in these texts. In this excerpt, the student is explaining two legal decisions that occurred half a century from each other. As we can se, the student does not aim to draw conclusions in relation to the results of the cases, but rather to present to the reader the two cases in their respective contexts.

Excerpt 14 (0397c).

This essay wil fous onth weth of decisions from1953 nd ontsthemwth hose of exctly 50 ears tr, deisions whch n elation to trusts law are considerably fwer in number, but no les in value. ..) Taken as  whole, the judgmens create a rich tapestry of judicil reasoning, where strict adherence to the rules runs alongside fanciful comment and brave expeditions into the unknown.

Observing the overall patterns of combination presented in Fig 1, we can see that to explain and to argue are central t the genre of essays, with very few texts in the corpus not containing one or the other, or a combination of both purposes.

# 3.2.2. Critiques

Similar to essays, most critiques contain a combination of to argue and to explain (see Fig. 2). Diffrent from essays, however, critiques usually combine these two purposes with a third purpose, such as to give a procedural recount or to narrate. This is not surprising as the BAwE definition of critiques involves demonstrating understanding of the object of study and the abilit to evaluate its significance.

Students use the purpose of to argue with the goal of providing an evaluation of the topic or the object of study being critiqued. They use to explain, on the other hand, to provide a detailed account of the uses and applications of the topic and the third purpose adds to this evaluation by adding detals about the object of study. The following excerpt is an example of this pattern in which the student uses to explain and to describe with the goal of presenting the major purposes of the text, which is to evaluate an object of study - the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.

Excerpt 15 (0143h).

Due to the wide scope of the Unted Ntions Convention on the Rights of the Child to wit a reort coverin all aspects f its implementation in the Russn Federation would be unsutable. This report shll therefore concentrat upon one of the ssues that has emerged s particularly pressing within Russi. his mater isth stat re children reeive when thy re ft wth n parentl care. Thereant onention rticles shall e d d an thot cr f the rt.   t rrt wille wer this da b willrequire lengthy, expensive State involvement.

Another frequent combination of purpose in critiques is the inclusion of to give a procedural acount in texts that already have argumentative and explanation purposes. These texts include a report of an experiment conducted or being reported to evaluate the object of study. In excerpt 16, we can clearly se this pattern. In this cae, the student is evaluatig the computer asisted desin oo. and in order to do so they need to consider a specific situation where this tool is used.

![](img/46a0c56d9de35a12ebf2401efcf521924371fbe2a5273e4e165a4e4b118d2467.jpg)

Excerpt 16 (0329h).

The purpose of this report is o give n asessment f CAD (Computer Assisted Deign) Tols in comparisonto manual desig tchiques. This will be, in part, achieved by considering a case study of a chain wheel from a bicycle.(0329h).

The purpose combinations found in critique reveal trong similarities with the combinations of purposes found in essays. In both of these genres, the combination of to argue and to explain is the most frequent. A marked difference between essays and critiques is the use of to give a procedural recount in some critiques, and the presence of more critiques with to argue, to explain and a third purpose.

# 3.2.3. Case study

According to Nesi and Gardner (2012, p.42) case studies involve descriptions of a particular case, with recommendations for future action'. Therefore, it is not surprising that the most frequent combination of purposes in this genre include to explain and to propose, as we can see in Fig. 3.

In texts that combine to propose and to explain, students give an account of the situation, or case, which they are analyzing and then suggest a plan to adressthe challenges encountered. We can see an example of this pattern in excerpt 17, where student first dtails the recommendations found in an oficial report and then proceeds to propose ways to implement said recommendations.

Excerpt 17 (0165c).

This report outlines the rcommendations found by the Operations Development Group on the potential changes proposed by the Operations Director wth regards to the fute f Cs.A thorough nalysis of the sugtd change, ossile implementtion stategies and efets on the relevant stakeholder groups has been conducted. The conclusions and recommendations are set out below.

Fig. 3 shows that the purpose combinations of case studies are markedly distinct from the ones found in essays and critiques.Inthis genre, combinations that include to propose are more common than those with to argue as was the case in essays and critiques.

# 3.2.4. Methodology recounts

To give a procedural recount i the major purpose found in methodology recounts (se Fig. 4). Most texts in this genre combine this purpose with to explain or with a range of other purposes.

Methodology recounts that combine to give a procedural recount and to explain, first retll the stes of an experiment, and then use the purpose of to explain with the goal of interpreting the results of this experiment. Excerpt 18 llustrate this pattern; in this excerpt the student uses to explain to give more detail about the theory behind the experiment and to explain how the ool used to conduct the experiment works.

Excerpt 18 (0250d).

The purpose of this report is to investigate the performance charactristics (e.g. eficiency and input power) f a centrifugal pump runnng at 2000 and 30 .)Th l  u in this im onvert th ericl  f the mr, first n kintic ey, hen into pressure energy of the fluid that is being pumped.

In contrast, methodology recounts that combine to give a procedural recount and to argue include justifications for the use of ? specific tool or way of conducting an experiment, as we can see in excerpt 19.

Excerpt 19 (3091f).

The main objectives of the investigation are: Perform practical experimental investigation of a freely supported stel plate using modl nalyis otware ) hisis n nt n when perfoming ysis n order to ache th dird ccy f the us the mesh element aspect ratio (length/width) should be kept as close to 1 as possible.

# 3.2.5. Explanations

Of all the genres investigated explanations seem to be most stable in relation to the major purpose, most texts in this genre $( 8 6 . 9 \% )$ have to explain as major purpose as can be seen in Fig. 5. This genre is somewhat similar to methodology recounts with the combination of to give a procedural recount and to explain being the most common in these texts.

![](img/2f06bdc6635b6e3ab767d05725d7df0435e1cebf369ac0844d94a4f05e79abd2.jpg)

Fig. 5. Purpose combinations in explanations.

The use of to give a procedural recount in explanations relates to the fact that most texts in this genre come from life and physical sciences. That is, they are similar to methodology recounts in the sense that they report an experiment Nevertheles, in explanations the student might not be involved in the practical experiment as excerpt 20 shows. In this excerpt, the student is explaining how x-rays work, but in order to do so they recount the practical applications of an x-ray.

Excerpt 20 (6097i).

Synchrotron radiation is a truly spectacular form of light, used in many situations as an aid to understanding the weird and wonderful stucture and behaviour f molcules atoms, crystals and iovatie nw materil. (.) This paper look t the develoment nd pplications of the revolutionary instrument which has given man unrivalled power and precision in probing the fundamental nature of matter.

Examining the combinations of purposes across genres, we can see that some combinations are common while others are rare. For example, to explain and to argue are usuall combined in essays and critiques. Methodology recounts and explanations are similar in that they both frequently combine to give a procedural recount and to explain. The most important patten across genres, however, is the finding that texts rarely occur with only a single communicative purpose. Rather, the overwhelming majority of student text from all five genres are written to accomplish multiple communicative purposes. Table 8 summarizes the most common patterns across the five genres investigated.

# 3.3. Purpose variation across disciplines in essays

As discusse in the introduction, the same genre in different disciplines might differ with respect to its expected communicative purposes. To explore this possibility, we focused on the genre of essays', comparing its typical communicative characteristics in three general disciplines: arts and humanties, scial sciences, and life and physical scices. Table 9 shows that essays acros disciplines are relatively similar in that they can adopt either an explanatory or argumentative major purpose. However, as the fllowing sections show, essays in each discipline tend to employ distinctive combinations of purposes.

# 3.3.1. Arts and humanities

Essays written in the arts and humanitie have combinations of purposes that include to argue and to explain, with the combination of both of these purposes being much more frequent than either purpose by itself.

At the same time, though, Fig. 6 shows that nearly all esays in the arts and humanities have to explain as either a primary or secondary purpose. For example, essays that combine to explain with to compare are common in humanities, demonstrating knowledge about two objects of study through a comparison. In excerpt 21, the student compares how the goddess Isis was depicted in different cultures as a means to explain the representation of this deity.

Excerpt 21 (6211e).

This essay shall xamine the evolution of the goddess sis i the tian, Grek and Rman enviroments n an aempt to asertin whether or not she ae catried s ein strily n Grk r Rman n  si mner, n attem ill be mde dein f Isis e seen as an old or a new deity.

A third frequent combination of purposes in arts and humanities is to argue, to explain, and to narrate. In these essays, to narrate is used in excerpts that trengthen the argument being made in the text. In excerpt 22 the author rells the events that occurred during the period of industrialisation in Russia in order to evaluate the reasons that led to the revolution.

Excerpt 22 $( 0 2 4 4 \mathrm { g } )$

In contrast tothe majorit of Eropean countries it was only in the yrs before 1914 that indusrilistion bean to rapidyoccur n Russi. (..) Firstl I wlok te effec f nstilistin and  Maris thorytmpting to exin the relionry tendecie of te Russin labour movement explored by the historian Christopher Read. (0244g).

# 3.3.2. Social sciences

In the social sciences, the most frequent combinations of purposes are similar to the ones found in arts and humanities: to explain and to argue are used together in almost al texts, often combined with athird purpose, such as to narrat or tocompare as we can see in Fig. 7.

In social sciences, the combination of to explain, to argue and to compare is used to argue in favor or against a theory, where the author analyses the theory and contrasts it to other possible theoreticl aproaches to the same issue. Excerpt 23 ilustrates this pattern. We can se that in this essy, the student is arguing i favor of basic income (UBI), and in order to do so, they compare their arguments to the ones of people who oppose the idea.

Excerpt 23 (0244k).

There have been further advantages proposed but they have tended to be of a more pragmatic nature and it i th principled arguments of Rawls and f isributiv ustce which ill argue preet the strongest rsoning for a Bl. I m going to compare the merits of my argument with those of other suorters and then attempt to defend a UBI against th many objections and altenatives which have ben suggested.

# 3.3.3. Life and physical sciences

In life and physical ciences, the most common patern of purpose combination also include to argue and to explain as illustrated in Fig. 8. Compared to the other two disciplinary groups, however, we notice that life and physical sciences have a broader variation ot other purposes. Under this category there are several ifferent combinations of papers with to give a procedural recount as a minor purpose, appearing seven times in different combinations.

The essays that contain to give a procedural recount combine this purpose with to explain or to argue in order to give practical examples to their arguments, as we can see in excerpt 24. In this ecerpt, the student i detaling a problem, but in order to do so they will report an experiment that involves gravity.

Excerpt 24 (6097j).

This paper loos at the reasons why the incorporation of gravity into an electromagnetic and nuclear force-containing theory is such c difficulty, and how the dilemma may one day be resolved, with a theory of Quantum Gravity. (6097j).

An examination of the different combination of purposes found in esays in these three disciplinary groups shows that combinations of to argue and to explain are the most common across al disciplines, but we see some variation when we examine lessfrequent combinations or combinations that have three purposes. In these cases, we can see that both arts and humanities and social sciences frequently include to narrate and to compare as a third purpose of essays, while esays in life and physical sciences show a broader variation of other purpose combinations. Table 10 summarizes the most common combination of purposes across disciplines.

# 4. Conclusion

Our goals in the present paper have been to investigate the possbility of purpose variation within genre categories in university writing, as wellas the osibilit that individual papers combine multiple urposes. Once we established that these possbilities were in fact the norm, we additionally attempted to document the most frequent combinations of communicative purposes across genres and disciplines.

In terms of variation among texts within a genre, the analysis has clearly shown that papers within a single genre often exhibit different major purposes. Esas and critiques are similar in that they frequently adopt both to argue and to explain as major purposes. Case studies contain a variety of major purposes, but most frequently to explain and to propose. Explanations and methodology recounts were the only two genres in which we could see a clear preference for a major purpose in most texts: to give a procedural recount in the case of methodology recounts and to explain in the case of explanations.

Table 10 Summary of major patterns for essays across disciplines.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Discipline</td><td>Common major purposes</td><td>Common minor purposes</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Arts and Humanities</td><td>to argue</td><td>to narrate</td></tr><tr><td>to explain</td><td>to compare</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Social Sciences</td><td>to argue</td><td>to narrate</td></tr><tr><td>to explain</td><td>to compare</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Life and Physical Sciences</td><td>to argue</td><td>to compare</td></tr><tr><td>to explain</td><td>to give a procedural recount</td></tr></table></body></html>

Looking at the extent to which diffrent purposes are combined in students texts, the analysis has revealed that most texts in all geres have at least two purposes. An examination into the dfferent patterns of purpose combination found in each genre revealed that both essays and critiques have combinations that include to argue and to explain, with critiques usuall including athird purpose as well. In adition, explanations and methodology recounts also combine to explain and to give a procedural recount, but they differ in terms of major purpose, with procedural recounts being usually the major purpose in methodology recounts and to explain being the major purpose in explanations. Case study was the genre with most distinct pattern of combination, combining to explain and to propose.

One striking pattern to emerge from the study is that the purpose f to explain is ubiquitous acros al genres of university writing. This purpose appears as one of the most used major purposes in almost al genres (with the exception of methodology recounts), and in texts where it does not ppear as a major purpose, it frequently occurs as a minor purpose. This finding corroborates previous studes, such as Hale et al. (1996), who also found explanations/analysis as part of the tass required from most university writing prompts.

Although it has not been our primary goal, the research findings presented above directly challenge any a priori notion of genre as a category that can be defined strictly in terms of shared communicative purpose. In fact, Swales (1990) somewhat vague theoretical definition of genre as text categories that \*share some set of communicative purposes" seems to best approximate the empirical findings of this stuy. Nevertheles, i is worth noting that the reults of this study point to the fact that texts within the same genre can have different ommunicative urposes, but the extent to which they share the same set of communicative purposes needs to be further investigated. With this study, we hope to have demonstrated that thereis extensive communicative variation among texts within genres. This of course leaves unanswered the theoretical question of how to define (or refine) the construct of genre (or register)-an issue that we are taking up in ongoing research.

In conclusion, our results here add to the growing number of TxtLx studies that document the nature of communicative and situational variation among the texts within genre/register categories. This study points to the need of investigating situational variation as well s linguisti variation, both across and within gnres/reisters. By adopting this reearch perspective that rcognizes how texts and genres/registers exist in a continuous space of both situational and linguistic variation, future reearch should be able to explore in much greater detail the ways in which linguistic characteristics occur in association with particular communicative/situational characteristics.
