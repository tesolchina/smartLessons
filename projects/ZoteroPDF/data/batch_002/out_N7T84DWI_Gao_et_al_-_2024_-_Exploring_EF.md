# ABSTRACT

Nowadays, the prevalence of ChatGPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs) has posed significant challenges into the education field, particularly in English education. In response, this study aimed to investigate the beliefs of 95 EFL university teachers from Chinese universities regarding the integration of LLMs in language education, as well as the relationships between their beliefs and other factors. The study yielded several findings: (1) According to the quantitative and qualitative results, we revealed several concerns among Chinese EFL university teachers regarding LLMs integration, such as neglection of traditional learning resources, academic integrity, and excessive reliance. (2) Previous experiences with LLMs, frequency of LLMs use, and self-evaluation on stages of LLMs integration all played vital roles in shaping university teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education. (3) No significant correlation was observed between university teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education and the availability of IT personnel. (4) No significant correlation was observed between university teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education their evaluation on IT infrastructure. This research has provided some insights into university teachers’ beliefs in ChatGPT and other LLMs to promote effective policies and strategies in the digital era.

# Introduction

In recent years, the field of language education has experienced notable advancements in technology (Zhi et al., 2023). In November 2022, OpenAI, a Microsoft-sponsored company, launched a cutting-edge Large Language Model (LLM) called ChatGPT. This breakthrough, along with other emerging LLMs has revolutionized conventional chatbots and presented remarkable opportunities and challenges to students, teachers, and even the policy-makers, which calls for more research into this field (Tlili et al., 2023). However, despite the growing interest in integrating ChatGPT and other LLMs into language education, there is a research gap when it comes to examining EFL university teachers’ beliefs in these innovative tools. Current literatures were mainly focused on examine the effectiveness of such technology (Chiu et al., 2023; Fryer et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2022) or focused on student-centre aspect (Farrokhnia et al., 2023; Perkins, 2023). Against this backdrop, this study aimed to investigate EFL university teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education, and thus provide further insights that could inform the development of effective policies in the context of English education.

# Literature review

# LLMs in language education

The field of language education is undergoing significant advancements with the introduction of LLMs. These models, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard, have revolutionized traditional chatbots and offer remarkable capabilities (Lo, 2023). Prior to the emergence of LLMs, researchers have extensively explored the application of chatbots in language education (Chiu et al., 2023; Fryer et al., 2017, 2020; Huang et al., 2022; Kerly et al., 2007). However, traditional chatbots faced limitations such as pre-defined responses and rule-based algorithms, which hindered their ability to adapt to learners’ diverse needs (Kohnke et al., 2023).

Recently, the research community has begun to explore the integration of ChatGPT and other LLMs into language education. Studies have found that ChatGPT can facilitate student’s access to information, promoting writing abilities, and boosting subjective learning (Farrokhnia et al., 2023; Perkins, 2023; Seetharaman, 2023). For instance, research by Tlili et al. (2023) demonstrated that while ChatGPT could sometimes lead to cheating and provide inaccurate information, it still offered learners powerful learning assistance, such as convenient assessment and spelling correction. Furthermore, studies also found that the use of ChatGPT and other LLMs could encourage personalized learning, foster complex learning, and even reduce teachers’ workload (Farrokhnia et al., 2023; Tlili et al., 2023; Zhai, 2022). These studies highlighted the potential of LLMs as learning tools, providing personalized and interactive simultaneous learning experiences.

However, despite the growing interest in the application of ChatGPT and other LLMs in language education, there is still a research gap in understanding teachers’ beliefs in the integration of LLMs in language education. Teachers’ beliefs play a crucial role in technology integration and professional development, particularly in today’s digital era (Gao et al., 2022). Investigating teachers’ beliefs in the use of ChatGPT and other LLMs can provide valuable insights into their technology acceptance and adaptation.

# Teachers’ beliefs in LLMs in language education

Teachers’ beliefs refer to their attitudes towards teaching, learning, and students in the educational process (Pajares, 1992). These beliefs influence teachers’ perceptions of effective teaching approaches (Wang, 2023), student motivation (Gao et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2022, 2023), teacher practices (Hu & Wang, 2023; Liu & Wang, 2024; Wang & Pan, 2023), and can even predicting students’ learning outcomes (Borg, 2011; Gao & Wang, 2022; Gao et al., 2022; Ma & Liu, 2023). Additionally, teachers’ beliefs are closely connected to their professional identity, which in turn impacts their behaviour and professional development (Heyder, 2019). In the field of technology integration in language education, however, there is a limited number of studies that have investigated teachers’ beliefs regarding LLMs. Previous studies have primarily focused on learners, examining the effects on enhancing students’ speaking abilities (Ayedoun et al., 2019; Fryer et al., 2017, 2019), reading abilities (Xu & Warschauer, 2020; Xu et al., 2021), and vocabulary acquisition (Kim, 2018). Regarding to teacher-related research, only one study has investigated teachers’ efficacy in chatbot settings (Song et al., 2022).

While there is a substantial body of research on teachers’ beliefs in language education, a notable gap exists in regarding the integration of LLMs, such as ChatGPT, into the language education. The emerging field of LLMs in education calls for a deeper understanding of how teacher beliefs shape their perceptions and instructional choices in the face of the significant challenges and opportunities in today’s digital era (Kasneci et al., 2023; Mohamed, 2023). Investigating teacher beliefs in the context of LLMs can provide valuable insights into educators’ perspectives on the use of such technologies for language education.

# Theoretical framework

The Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) serves as a crucial framework for interpreting and predicting one’s behaviours when adopting innovations (Eccles et al., 1983). According to EVT, people’s decision to embrace a particular innovation is influenced by their expectations of achieving success and perceived value of desired outcomes. In other word, EVT suggests that people are more likely to adopt innovations if they believe in their ability to effectively implement them and if the accompanying benefits outweigh the costs. EVT has been widely applied in educational research and professional development (Hulleman et al., 2008). Building on the EVT model, Wozney et al. (2006) investigated teachers’ willingness to integrate computer-related innovations in schools. Their work explored teachers’ expectations regarding the adoption of technology innovations in class, considering factors such as their perceived value of the innovation, anticipated success in implementation, and the associated costs of implementation (Wozney et al., 2006).

Drawing on the previous literatures and theoretical framework presented above, this study aims to investigate Chinese EFL university teachers’ beliefs in integrating ChatGPT and other LLMs in language education. The research questions (RQs) are as follows:

RQ1: How do Chinese EFL university teachers perceive integrating LLMs in language education?

RQ2: What is the relationship between university teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education and their previous experiences?

RQ3: What is the relationship between university teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education and the availability of IT personnel in their institutions?

RQ4: What is the relationship between university teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education and their evaluation on IT infrastructure?

# Methodology

# Research design

The present study deployed an online-based questionnaire, entailing both quantitative scales and a qualitative open-ended question, to delve into teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education. The quantitative aspect entailed scales adapted from the work of Wozney et al. (2006) to assess Chinese EFL university teachers’ beliefs and the relationships amongst them. The obtained data were analysed using SPSS version 26. On the other hand, the qualitative component featured an open-ended question, aiming to excavate deeper insights into teachers’ beliefs. The ensuing data were transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006) using NVivo 11.

# Participants

In the present study, our primary focus was to investigate Chinese university EFL university teachers beliefs in the integration of LLMs in language education. To achieve this goal, we utilized onlinebased snowball sampling approach to gather comprehensive insights from EFL university teachers. A total of 111 responses were collected for the study. However, during the data screening process, 5 responses were excluded as the respondents claimed to have never heard of LLMs such as ChatGPT; 3 were excluded as the failure of attention check; 8 were excluded because of the duplicate responses. As a result, our analysis included a final sample of 95 respondents who provided valuable responses.

Table 1. Demographic profile.

Table 1 presents the demographic profile of the respondents. Notably, the respondent composition indicates a higher proportion of female respondents $( 6 9 . 4 7 \% )$ ) compared to male respondents $( 3 0 . 5 3 \% )$ . Additionally, a significant majority of the respondents reported having less than 5 years of teaching experience $( 4 2 . 1 1 \% )$ . Moreover, the table reveals that the most frequently reported average class size fell within the range of 21–50 students $( 4 7 . 3 7 \% )$ . Furthermore, the respondents represent diverse types of universities, with a notable percentage from comprehensive universities $( 4 3 . 2 7 \% )$ and technical universities $( 2 6 . 9 2 \% )$ ).

# Data collection

This study employed an anonymous online-based questionnaire as the primary method for the data collection. The questionnaire was designed to collect both quantitative and qualitative data from the respondents. The data collection was conducted between 5 June 2023, and 1 July 2023.

The questionnaire began with a consent form that clearly stated the purpose of the study, and assured respondents that their answers would remain anonymous throughout the study. Besides, all the respondents were informed that their participation was entirely voluntary and that they could withdraw from the study at any time.

The quantitative phase of the questionnaire consisted of a set of scales adapted from the work of Wozney et al. (2006). These scales were designed to measure various factors related to the integration of LLMs in language education. The respondents were invited to rate their specific beliefs, preferences, and experiences using a Likert scale or other relevant response formats.

In addition to the quantitative phase, the questionnaire also included a qualitative phase. Within this phase, an open-ended question was provided to the respondents, inviting them to share their specific concerns and beliefs related to incorporating LLMs into their language education practices. Additionally, to facilitate participants’ responses, the online questionnaire platform provided a voiceto-text feature, allowing convenient description of their perspectives.

# Data analysis

This study utilized SPSS and NVivo software to analyse data from a total of 95 Chinese EFL university teachers. During the quantitative analysis, the internal reliability of the collected instruments was verified using a Cronbach’s Alpha value. Additionally, to address RQ2, RQ3, and RQ4, frequencies and percentages for all specific responses were reported, while Spearman’s rho coefficients $( \boldsymbol { \mathsf { r } } _ { s } )$ were reported for correlations among different variables. In the qualitative analysis, the data obtained in the open-ended question were coded in NVivo using thematic analysis.

# Instruments

The present study utilized multiple instruments to measure various factors regarding EFL university teachers’ beliefs in LLMs integration in language education. Specifically, some of the instruments were adapted from the work of Wozney et al. (2006); Others were designed by all the authors in the present study. A detailed breakdown of the instruments is presented in the Appendix.

Before conducting further analysis, we ran a Cronbach’s Alpha test to verify the internal reliability of the collected instruments. The calculated Cronbach’s Alpha value was 0.986, indicating a high level of internal reliability. All the instruments were initially presented in Chinese and then translated into English for further investigation. The translated scripts underwent a back-translation for quality assessment and were double-checked by all the authors. To reduce any order effect bias in the questionnaire, all the measurements were presented in a random order. Specifically, the instruments in the present study includes (1) preferred teaching mode, (2) IT infrastructure and IT support personnel, (3) frequency of LLMs use, (4) stage of LLMs integration in language education, (5) beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education.

Preferred teaching mode. In this sector, the respondents were asked to indicate their preferred teaching mode. The options presented to them encompassed three distinct approaches: teacher-centred, student-centred, and a balanced combination of teachercentred and student-centred approaches.

IT infrastructure and support personnel. Firstly, the respondents’ perceptions of the IT infrastructure were assessed by asking them to rate its quality on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1(extremely dissatisfied) to 5 (extremely satisfied). They were then inquired about the presence of IT support personnel within their respective institutions. If the response was affirmative, the respondents were further asked to evaluate the responsiveness of the IT support personnel in resolving their concerns in a timely manner.

Frequency of LLMs usage. The respondents were firstly queried about their prior experience with LLMs. Those who indicated previous and continued usage of LLMs were further questioned about the frequency of their LLMs usage.

Stage of LLMs integration in language education. Within this sector, the respondents were asked to describe their respective stages of LLMs integration in language education, as adapted from Wozney’s et al. (2006). The six progressive stages are: (1) awareness, (2) learning, (3) understanding, (4) familiarity, (5) adaptation, and (6) creative adaptation.

Beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education. The Technology Implementation Questionnaire (TIQ) was designed to assess teachers’ beliefs in integrating technology (Wozney et al., 2006). In the present study, the respondents were asked to rate 14 items based on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). These items were selected from the original work by Wozney et al. (2006), and were modified accordingly to suit the specific context of the present study.

# Findings

This section provides an overview of the findings from the quantitative and qualitative analysis in the present study. Specifically, the results of descriptive analysis, factor analysis, Spearman’s correlations and thematic analysis were reported below.

# Quantitative analysis

In the present study, the quantitative analysis consisted of three main components: (1) Descriptive Statistics, (2) Factor Analysis, and (3) Spearman’s Correlations. The data were analysed and then reported below.

# Descriptive statistics

Preferred teaching mode. Figure 1 illustrated the preferred teaching modes reported by the respondents. The majority of respondents (64, $6 7 . 3 7 \%$ indicated a preference for the balanced teaching mode, while a smaller proportion favoured the student-centred ( $\underline { { 2 0 } } , 2 1 . 0 5 \%$ or teacher-centred (11, $1 1 . 5 8 \% )$ teaching modes.

IT infrastructure and support personnel. Regarding the IT infrastructure, a majority of the respondents (45, $4 7 . 3 7 \% )$ rated it as “moderate”. Furthermore, a notable proportion (37, $3 8 . 9 5 \%$ expressed satisfaction or extreme satisfaction, while a smaller proportion (13, $1 3 . 6 8 \%$ ) expressed dissatisfaction or extreme dissatisfaction.

In terms of IT support personnel, $40 \%$ of respondents (38) reported the availability of dedicated IT personnel or a technical support team in their schools, while $60 \%$ (57) reported the absence of IT personnel. Among the 38 respondents who claimed to have dedicated IT personnel, $3 6 . 8 4 \%$ indicated that the team rarely or never assisted them in resolving technical issues. Conversely, $2 3 . 6 8 \%$ of respondents expressed that the support team was responsive and consistently able to address their needs in a timely manner. Additionally, $3 9 . 4 7 \%$ of respondents reported that the IT personnel were generally responsive, although occasionally unable to resolve their problems.

Frequency of LLMs usage. Table 2 presented teachers’ frequency of LLMs usage. The majority of the respondents $( 5 0 . 5 3 \% )$ indicated that they have never tried LLMs before, while a minority of respondents $( 5 . 2 6 \% )$ ) reported using them always.

Stage of LLMs integration in language education. Figure 2 illustrates how EFL university teachers perceived their levels of LLMs integration. The majority of the respondents (58, $6 1 . 0 5 \% )$ described themselves at the “Awareness” stage, where they were only aware of the potential of LLMs in language education but had not yet applied them or had no interests in employing them in their teaching practices. The “Creative adaptation” stage presents another extreme, with only 2 respondents $( 2 . 1 1 \% )$ believed they were capable of integrating LLMs into language education and modify them easily as instructional aids at their discretion.

Beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education. Table 3 presents EFL university teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education. To ease the interpretation process, the negative-oriented statements (statements 3, 4, and 14) were reversely-coded, where a higher value indicates a more positive attitude towards the beliefs. The beliefs with the highest mean score (M) include statements “Is a valuable instructional tool” $( M = 4 . 5 5$ , $\mathsf { S D } = 0 . 9 6 5$ ) and “Empowers teachers to facilitate learning rather than simply provide information” $\langle M = 4 . 7 5$ , $\mathsf { S D } = 0 . 9 5 6 )$ . The beliefs related to the effectiveness of LLMs for students are also generally positive. Teachers perceive LLMs as effective tools for enhancing students’ academic achievement $( M = 4 . 1 9$ , $\mathsf { S D } = 0 . 9 3 7$ ), motivating students to actively engage in language learning $M = 4 . 0 6 ,$ $\mathsf { S D } = 0 . 9 9 8 \mathrm { \mathrm { ~ } }$ ), and improving students’ understanding of critical concepts and ideas $( M = 4 . 3 8$ , $\mathsf { S D } = 0 . 8 8 9$ ). However, some beliefs received relatively lower mean scores, such as “Does not lead students to neglect traditional learning resources” $\cdot M = 3 . 4 4$ , SD $= 1 . 3 7 4 )$ ), and “Does not require extra time for planning learning activities” $( M = 3 . 6 7 , 5 \mathsf { D } = 1 . 4 8 4 )$ . This indicated some concerns among EFL university teachers regarding LLMs integration.

M stands for mean score, and SD stands for standard deviation. Items with asterisk were negatively-presented, reverse-coded in correlation tests, and normally-coded in factor analysis.

# Factor analysis

To assess the suitability of the data for factor analysis, the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) Measure of Sampling Adequacy and Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity were conducted. The KMO measure yielded a value of 0.778, indicating an adequate sample for further analysis. Additionally, Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity yielded a significant result (approximate chi-square $= 7 9 0 . 0 8 0$ , $d f = 9 1$ , $p < 0 . 0 0 1$ ). This indicates that the correlation matrix of the variables is significantly different from an identity matrix. Thus, the data can be considered suitable for the factor analysis.

In the initial factor analysis, three factors were identified, with first two factors showing significantly stronger loadings compared to the third. Consequently, items 9–13 were removed, resulting in two distinct categories. Factor 1 represented “Positive Beliefs” on using LLMs in language education, while Factor 2 represented “Negative Beliefs”, which were previously reverse-coded and negatively worded, on using LLMs in language education. The factor loadings are presented in Table 4.

To examine the possible differences between the positive and negative beliefs in using LLMs based on respondents’ experience, the samples were divided into two groups: one consisting of respondents who have used LLMs before, and the other consisting of respondents who have NOT used LLMs before. Table 5 provided detailed data.

For the group of respondents who have used LLMs, the mean score for “Positive Beliefs” is 4.56, with a SD of 0.97, while the mean score for “Negative Beliefs” is 3.06, with an SD of 1.37. In contrast, for the group of respondents who have NOT used LLMs, the mean score for “Positive Beliefs” is slightly lower at 4.34, with an SD of 0.99, while the mean score for “Negative Beliefs” is 3.20, with an SD of 1.37. These results suggested that, on average, respondents who have used LLMs before tend to have higher levels of positive beliefs and lower level of negative beliefs than those who have NOT used LLMs before.

# Spearman’s correlations

Spearman’s correlation tests were conducted to identify statistically significant correlations, as shown in Table 6. We found a positive correlation (0.313, $\rho { < } 0 . 0 1$ ) between self-evaluation on stages of LLMs integration and respondents’ positive beliefs. Additionally, we found a negative correlation between self-evaluation on stages of LLMs integration and respondents’ negative beliefs. This indicates that respondents who evaluated themselves more positively on the stages of LLMs integration tended to have stronger positive beliefs and weaker negative beliefs about using LLMs in language education.

Furthermore, we found positive correlations between respondents’ frequency of LLMs usage and items listed in Table 7. Specifically, respondents with higher frequency of LLMs usage were more likely to believe LLMs could enhance students’ academic achievement (0.226, $\rho < 0 . 0 5$ ), be an effective tool and a valuable instructional tool (0.304, $\rho < 0 . 0 1$ ; 0.229, $\rho \ : < 0 . 0 5 $ ), and improve students’ understanding of critical concepts and ideas (0.226, $\rho < 0 . 0 5$ ).

# Qualitative analysis

The responses from the open-ended question were transcribed and saved in Microsoft Excel format before entered into the NVivo 11 for analysis. The answers were codified into 7 categories, as presented in Table 8. Prior to the analysis, we discovered that 16 respondents $( 1 6 . 8 4 \% )$ stated that they did not know what could be the possible challenges or benefits in integrating LLMs in language education.

Table 8. Emerging themes about challenges of implementing LLMs.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Themes</td><td>n</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>Academic integrity</td><td>26</td><td>27.37%</td></tr><tr><td>Excessive reliancee</td><td>25</td><td>26.32%</td></tr><tr><td>I don&#x27;t know</td><td>16</td><td>16.84%</td></tr><tr><td>Effectiveness</td><td>11</td><td>11.58%</td></tr><tr><td>Teachers&#x27; identitye</td><td>7</td><td>7.37%</td></tr><tr><td>Authenticity of information</td><td>6</td><td>6.32%</td></tr><tr><td> Privacy leakagee</td><td>4</td><td>4.21%</td></tr></table></body></html>

The theme of “Academic Integrity” emerged as the most frequently cited concern, encompassing 26 respondents, constituting $2 7 . 3 7 \%$ of the total. This thematic category encapsulates the collective worry about the potential misuse of LLMs by their students for academic dishonesty, such as plagiarism in the routine classroom assignments, academic reports, and essays writing. For instance, one respondent articulated this concern, stating, “I am mainly concerned that students may encounter some academic ethical issues due to the use of LLMs. Whether there is plagiarism, and whether they directly use these models to complete their assignments or write papers”. Another respondent also stated that: “LLMs have increased the difficulty of grading assignments. I feel that they have led to a significant rise in instances of academic dishonesty or plagiarism among students according to my recent practice”. These statements illustrate the pervasive worry about the academic integrity, fearing that the accessibility and capabilities of LLMs might tempt their students to engage in academic-related unethical practices, thereby compromising the authenticity of students’ work.

Another theme that gained significant attention was “Excessive Reliance”, identified by 25 respondents, representing $2 6 . 3 2 \%$ of the total responses. This theme demonstrates the overall concerns regarding the possibility of students’ excessively depending on LLMs, potentially to the detriment of their independent learning skills. For example, one respondent shared this concern, stating, “I am concerned that students may lose motivation for language learning and substitute their own efforts in the learning process by over-relying on the technology of ChatGPT and other LLMs”. Additionally, another respondent emphasized the potential consequences of over-reliance, stating, “I am concerned that LLMs may lead to students’ excessive dependence, limiting the development of their own cognitive abilities”. These statements highlight the fear that an overreliance on LLMs could impede students’ natural development of critical thinking and problemsolving abilities.

The theme of “Effectiveness” reflected respondents’ concerns about the genuine utility of LLMs as effective scaffolds in language education. A notable subset of 11 respondents $( 1 1 . 5 8 \% )$ raised poignant questions about whether LLMs genuinely contribute to and enhance students’ language learning experiences. One respondent aptly articulated their scepticism, stating, $^ { \prime \prime } |$ quite questioned the feasibility of LLMs in language education. That is because many innovations in foreign language education have ended up in failure. I believed that they (LLMs) should only serve as a supplementary tool to enhance traditional teaching methods rather than overshadow them”. This statement reflects a broader apprehension among respondents about the practicality and viability of integrating LLMs into language education.

The theme of “Teachers’ identity” emerged prominently, with 7 respondents $( 7 . 3 7 \% )$ voiced concerns about the potential impact of LLMs on the identity and role of EFL university teachers. Their apprehensions centred around the potential threat of LLMs undermining teachers’ authority, inducing changes in their traditional teaching methods and altering the traditional role of teachers. For instance, one respondent conveyed a sense of unease, stating, “I feel that in the future, what teachers say may not carry as much authority as LLMs does”. This statement reflects a concern that LLMs could diminish the perceived authority of teachers, potentially reconstructing the dynamics of the teacher-student relationship. Another respondent expressed uncertainty about the evolving role of teachers in the face of advancing technology: “I am unsure about how the role of teachers should evolve in the future if this technology is indeed applied”. Additionally, the concerns went beyond the immediate classroom impact, as one respondent even voiced anxieties about the existential impact on EFL university teachers: “LLMs are likely to have a direct impact on the survival of EFL university teachers like us”. This statement underscores the apprehension regarding the long-term professional viability of EFL teachers in the face of technological advancements.

The theme “Authenticity of Information” resonated with the worries of 6 respondents $( 6 . 3 2 \% )$ , reflecting concerns about the reliability and genuineness of language resources or content provided by LLMs. Respondents expressed reservations regarding the potential for misinformation or inaccuracies in the language materials generated by LLMs.

The theme “Privacy Leakage” was expressed by 4 respondents $( 4 . 2 1 \% )$ , who voiced concerns about potential data security challenges associated with the use of LLMs. Respondents raised apprehensions about the possibility of sensitive information or personal data being compromised during the utilization of these models.

# Discussion

This study sought to gain deeper insights into teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLM in language education and the relationships between their beliefs and other factors, employing both quantitative and qualitative analyses. This sector presents specific answers to RQ1, RQ2, RQ3, and RQ4.

# Chinese EFL university teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education

To gain a comprehensive landscape of Chinese EFL university teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education, this study utilized both quantitative and qualitative methods. Though the quantitative data regarding teachers’ beliefs primarily focused on exploring their relationships with other factors, it is valuable to incorporate findings from the quantitative analysis into the discussion of RQ1. According to the quantitative analysis (4.1.1 Descriptive Statistics), the respondents believed ChatGPT and other LLMs can serve as a powerful instructional tool $( M = 4 . 5 5 , \mathsf { S D } =$ 0.965), enhance students’ academic achievement $( M = 4 . 1 9 $ , $\mathsf { S D } = 0 . 9 3 7 ,$ ), motivate students to actively engage in language learning $( M = 4 . 0 6$ , $\mathsf { S D } = 0 . 9 9 8$ ), improve students’ understanding of critical concepts ( $M = 4 . 3 8$ , $\mathsf { S D } = 0 . 8 8 9$ ), and even empower teachers facilitate learning rather than simply provide information $\langle M = 4 . 7 5$ , $\mathsf { S D } = 0 . 9 5 6 )$ . However, the respondents also questioned the feasibility of integrating LLMs in language education, worrying LLMs could result in neglection of traditional learning resources $M = 3 . 4 4$ , $\mathsf { S D } = 1 . 3 7 4 )$ and extra planning time $M = 3 . 6 7$ , $\mathsf { S D } = 1 . 4 8 4 )$ .

In conjunction with the quantitative analysis, a thematic analysis was conducted. The themes that emerged shed light on the various aspects of Chinese EFL university teachers’ beliefs in LLMs. Specifically, the themes identified include concerns like: academic integrity, excessive reliance, effectiveness, teachers’ identity, authenticity of information, and privacy leakage. These themes offered a rich understanding of the factors that shape teachers’ beliefs in LLMs in language education. These findings align with the previous literature, suggesting consistency in EFL university teachers’ beliefs in implementing such technology innovation in language education (Chiu et al., 2023; Fryer et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2022; Kerly et al., 2007).

# Previous LLMs experience play a vital role in mediating teachers’ beliefs

In the current study, the relationship between teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLMs and their previous experiences was investigated using quantitative analysis. Firstly, we found no significant correlations between teachers’ beliefs and their years of teaching, as well as the preferred teaching mode, which presented disparity with the previous literature (Bice & Tang, 2022; Ifinedo et al., 2020). In relation to their years of teaching, Pamuk (2012) emphasized that in preservice teacher education, the development of pedagogical content knowledge should be complemented by teaching experience. This is in contrast to the findings of the current study. In terms of preferred modes of teaching, Caratachea and Monty Jones (2023) proposed that educators can craft student-centric, maker learning experiences using immersive VR devices tailored for K-12 science curricula. Again, this stands in contrast to the discoveries presented in this paper.

One possible explanation is that according to the feedback of the respondents, ChatGPT and other LLMs are still a relatively novel technology in the context of language education. In this study, we found that a significant number of respondents $( 5 0 . 5 3 \% )$ ) claimed that they have never tried LLMs before, although they have heard of the potential of such technology. This means that many Chinese

EFL university teachers have limited understanding of LLMs, and thus they did not know how to incorporate such technology into language education.

Additionally, we found that in regarding beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education, those who have used LLMs before have higher levels of positive beliefs and lower level of negative beliefs than those who have NOT used LLMs before. Besides, we also observed significant correlations between (1) self-evaluation on stages of LLMs integration and teachers’ positive beliefs, (2) self-evaluation on stages of LLMs integration and teachers’ negative beliefs, and (3) frequency of LLMs usage andseveral positive beliefs. Specifically, we found that EFL university teachers who evaluated themselves more positively on the stages of LLMs integration tended to have stronger positive beliefs and weaker beliefs about using LLMs in language education, while teachers with higher frequency of LLMs usage were more likely believed LLMs could enhance students’ academic achievement, be an effective tool and a valuable instructional tool, and improve students’ understanding of critical concepts and ideas. These findings are in line with the previous literatures regarding teachers’ beliefs in technology implementation (Ahmadishokouh & Samadi, 2021; Albirini, 2006; Kaplan-Rakowski et al., 2023).

# No significant correlation was observed between teachers’ beliefs and the availability of IT personnel or their evaluation on IT infrastructure

In the current study, the relationships between teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLMs and (1) the availability of IT personnel in their institutions (2) their evaluations on IT infrastructure were investigated using quantitative analysis, specifically the Spearman’s correlation test. Surprisingly, the findings did not reveal a significant relationship between these factors, which contrasts the conclusions in the previous literature in regarding of language teachers’ beliefs in technology integration (Kaplan-Rakowski et al., 2023; Kilinc et al., 2018).

In the context of IT personnel availability, Huang et al. (2023) underscored the pivotal role of technical support in technology integration. Moreover, they advised policymakers and teacher trainers to make well-informed decisions concerning technical support and the ongoing professional development of teachers. This stands in contrast to the findings of the present study. In relation to IT infrastructure, Tom and Kumar (2021) elaborated on the application and efficacy of technology in English language instruction. They emphasized the pressing need for an enhanced infrastructure to navigate the challenges posed by evolving technological trends. This, again, contrasts with the findings of our research. We believed that such disparity could be attributed to several factors.

Firstly, ChatGPT and other LLMs are still considered a relatively novel technology in the context of China. In the present study, $5 0 . 5 3 \%$ of the respondents claimed that they have not employed LLMs before, indicating that many Chinese EFL university teachers have limited exposure or in-depth experience with such innovation.

Secondly, the implementation of LLMs may not necessarily require the direct support from IT personnel or the IT infrastructure in schools. Many LLM platforms, taking ChatGPT as example, have provided user-friendly interface and thus require minimal technical expertise. Consequently, EFL university teachers who are enthusiastic about novel technology may independently explore these tools and implement them into their teaching practices without the assistance from IT personnel and schools’ IT infrastructure. This could further diminish the influences of IT personnel and IT infrastructure on teachers’ beliefs regarding LLMs implementation.

Additionally, it is worth noting that the use of LLMs is often driven by self-motivated individuals. Teachers who proactively embrace the new technologies and are early adopters of innovative approaches may be more inclined to explore ChatGPT and other LLMs without relying heavily on IT supports. As a result, their beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education may be independent of the availability of IT personnel and schools’ IT infrastructure.

# Conclusion

In recent years, with the significant development in technology applications, ChatGPT and other LLMs have revolutionized traditional chatbots and provide remarkable challenges into language education field. To explore EFL university teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education and the relationships between their beliefs and other factors, this study surveyed 95 teachers from Chinese universities. The results revealed that (1) several concerns emerged in regarding LLMs integration, such as neglection of traditional learning resources, academic integrity, excessive reliance, (2) previous experiences of LLMs use, frequency of LLMs use, and self-evaluation on stages of LLMs integration played vital role in mediating teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLM in language education, (3) no significant correlation was found between teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education and the availability of IT personnel or their evaluation on IT infrastructure. This research has provided valuable insights regarding teachers’ beliefs in ChatGPT and other LLMs in promoting effective policies and strategies in the digital era.

In light of the findings from this study, several implications for pedagogical practices emerge. First, the significance of teacher beliefs cannot be overstated; they play a pivotal role in determining the adoption and effective utilization of large language models in the classroom. Secondly, foreign language educators must proactively embrace technology, as a positive belief system can significantly enhance technology integration within the classroom. Lastly, it’s imperative for these educators to assimilate large language models into their teaching approach and intensify their efforts in acquiring technological expertise, ensuring a more enriching and up-to-date learning experience for their students.

While this study provides valuable insights into teachers’ beliefs in LLMs application, it is important to note several limitations. (1) Only a limited number of respondents were involved in this study. Only Chinese EFL university teachers were included as the respondents. (2) In the present study, the qualitative data was only obtained from an open-ended question. The utilization of just one open-ended question may not elicit the kind of in-depth, multifaceted responses that more extensive qualitative methods, such as interviews or observations, might garner. This approach could limit the breadth and depth of qualitative insights. (3) The sampling method in this study may cause several limitations to the findings. For instance, the online-based snowball sampling might have brought a biased result.

Therefore, to obtain a deeper and more holistic understanding of teachers’ beliefs in integrating LLMs in language education, it is suggested that future research should consider (1) incorporating more EFL university teachers from worldwide as the respondents, (2) conducting in-depth interview to gain richer qualitative data from the respondents, (3) applying more rigorous sampling methods to strengthen the representativeness of the results.
