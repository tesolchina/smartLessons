# Abstract

Peer reviews of research articles submitted to journals are an occluded genre, that is, they are not publicly available documents which are part of the research record. When submitting their first scientific papers to international journals for publication, NNSE (non-native speaker of English) novice researchers face the challenging task of framing effective replies to referees’ criticisms, a complex process requiring considerable socio-cultural sensitivity and pragma-linguistic competence. In order to lessen the impact of linguistic and cultural barriers to early publication, it is likely that an awareness of relevant features of peer reviews would be helpful. However, as gatekeeping discourse, peer reviews remain largely under-researched principally due to their hidden status and issues of confidentiality. This study presents the description and analysis of referees’ comments contained in a corpus of 40 peer reviews of short scientific papers known as Letters. In the task of revising their manuscripts for publication, novice researchers need to interpret appropriately the motivation behind referees’ comments, for example, whether they are more directed towards revision of the technical subject matter (ideational), the effectiveness of the writer’s interaction with the reader in the text (interpersonal), or an aspect of the text itself, for example, its format or length (textual). The results of this study highlight the strongly interpersonal orientation of referees’ concerns, with two-thirds of all comments in the corpus focusing on interactional deficiencies of NNSE researchers’ manuscripts.

# 1. Introduction

There has been increasing interest in recent years in studying examples of occluded genres, models of genres which are not publicly available documents and to which researchers, teachers, and students usually have little or no access. Swales notes that ‘academic occluded genres are, in part, those which support the research publication process but are not themselves part of the research record’ (1996, p. 45). Peer reviews of research articles submitted to academic journals are a prime example of occluded discourse because they reflect the traditional review system in the academy whereby anonymous referees critique others’ work, itself an opaque process which continues to raise serious ethical issues in scientific publication about the rights and duties of authors and referees.

Highlighting an increasing focus on the social practices of disciplinary communities, gatekeeping genres are of particular interest to discourse analysts because they are seen as crucial sites of disciplinary engagement (Hyland, 2000), where insiders can make use of their cultural knowledge to gain advantage over novices and those on the periphery. Thus, examples of peer evaluation such as referees’ reports function to a greater or lesser extent as mechanisms of acculturation into discourse communities. For novices, the rite of passage of publishing their first research papers in international journals involves learning how to first interpret and then respond effectively to criticisms made in referees’ reports. However, this process represents an uncertain challenge. A lack of cross-cultural awareness of review and publication procedures, that is, of how the culture of international scientific publication works and of the linguistic expertise required to demonstrate that awareness, may be one of the many factors which can hinder novices’ early productivity. These concerns are of particular significance for those involved in supporting the writing activities of NNSE novice researchers, for example, through the teaching of specialist EAP courses to doctoral candidates who are required to publish in English.

From a pedagogical viewpoint, it would be useful to shed some light on relevant features of peer reviews, so that NNSE novice researchers may be able to lessen the impact of linguistic and cultural barriers to being productive from the start of their careers. As Flowerdew notes, ‘anything that helps demystify the editorial process is likely to be helpful for novice contributors to international journals’ (2001, p. 146). To this end, this study presents the description and analysis of referees’ comments in reviews of scientific research papers, based on Halliday’s (1985) metafunctional framework. We start with a brief overview of research on peer review.

# 2. Research on peer review

The central aims of peer review are to help editors select the most appropriate papers for their journals and to improve published papers in terms of both their scientific quality and written presentation. Although it is generally assumed that review practices largely achieve their stated aims, they are a contentious issue in professional science, since such practices are based on tradition and not on strong scientific evidence of their effectiveness (Fletcher & Fletcher, 1997). Thus in recent years, a growing body of research on peer review has emerged to question both the effectiveness and the ethics of traditional editorial practices. For example, in the biomedical field, a special issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association $( 2 8 0 / 1$ , 1998) published 33 papers from the International Peer Review Congress on issues such as the effect on the quality of peer review of masking authors’ identities and asking reviewers to sign their reports. [For a useful overview of research on peer review, see Fletcher & Fletcher (1997); also Godlee, Gale, & Martyn (1998); Godlee & Jefferson (1999); Goldbeck-Wood (1998, 1999); Smith (1999); Websites http:// www.jama-peer.org; http://www.bmj.com/cgi/collection/peer_review]. Broadly speaking, findings from much of this research are inconclusive, for example, studies report that there appears to be very little significant difference in the quality of peer review between anonymous and identified referees, or in their recommendations regarding publication, or in the time taken to review papers. It is largely for ethical reasons, therefore, for the purposes of increased accountability, fairness, and transparency, that peer review practices are being challenged in professional science fields.

Increasingly, journals themselves and their publication practices have become the subject of their own field of study, ‘journalology’ (Fletcher & Fletcher, 1997), in part since the process of peer review is one which is complicated by the absence of standardized approaches to what information reviews should contain or regarding their format. Although the present system shares common features, different disciplines, journals, and publishers can all add to the diversity of procedures followed and guidelines given to reviewers and contributors. In addition, different linguistic backgrounds and cultural expectations will likely affect the experience of NNSE researchers whose submissions undergo peer review. Thus, ‘journalology’ and research into peer review practices is clearly an area which brings together a broad spectrum of interests.

In Applied Linguistics and ESL-related fields, the term peer review has been discussed in various contexts, for example, concerning published academic book reviews (Hyland, 2000; Salager-Meyer, 2001), graduate students’ reviews of each other’s term papers (Johnson, 1992), and online peer review in pre-college ESL writing classes (DiGiovanni & Nagaswami, 2001). In comparison to these examples of ‘open’ reviews, what clearly distinguishes peer reviews of research articles submitted to journals is that they are intended to be confidential and referees are usually anonymous. Kourilova´ (1996) appears to be the only major study of communication strategies in peer reviews of scientific articles which has been applied to ESP contexts. Adopting a framework of analysis based on politeness theory (Brown & Levinson, 1987), she looked at the organization of compliments and criticism and at the frequency of face-threatening acts in a corpus of peer reviews of 80 manuscripts written by NNSE scientists. That the reviews contained 4.5 times as many blunt as mitigated criticisms was principally assumed to be due to the anonymity afforded to referees, the perceived power difference between participants, and the fact that reviews are not published.

Kourilova´ ’s study shows that since reviews are an exceptional example of ‘onrecord criticism’ in written peer communication, it is vital for NNSE authors to recognize the communicative purposes and genre conventions of reviews in order to understand better referees’ intentions, which in turn should help authors to employ appropriate rhetorical strategies in addressing referees’ suggested changes. With these objectives in mind, this study aims to add to Kourilova´ ’s work by applying a framework of analysis broadly based on Halliday’s (1985) metafunctional categories of language to a corpus of referees’ comments in reviews of short scientific papers known as Letters.

# 3. The study

# 3.1. The Letters journal

The main concern of Letters journals is the rapid circulation of new findings. Therefore the length of such papers is restricted and the review process is streamlined, taking often just one to two months from initial submission to publication (Hyland, 2000). The present data come from an international Letters journal publishing approximately 30 papers weekly in a hard science field; submissions are limited to 2500 words. Regional advisory editors handle local papers (in this case, all submitted from Japanese researchers), but English is used for all official correspondence, which includes reports from both NSE and NNSE referees, authors’ pointby-point replies with re-submissions, and editorial records and correspondence.

The review process of the Letters journal was described as ‘anonymous’, in that referees know the identity and affiliation of the author(s) but not vice versa, as against a ‘blind’ process, where the intention is that neither party knows the identity of the other. However, in its submission guidelines, the journal asks that contributions should be sent to an editorial board member ‘who is familiar with the research reported’; moreover, ‘authors are urged to suggest the names of three appropriate referees’ when submitting papers, suggesting a potentially more ‘open’ approach to peer review. As mentioned earlier, the fairness and effectiveness of such different approaches to review procedures are currently the subject of much debate in the professional science literature.

In the present case, the only explicit review guidelines given to referees by the Letters journal were that particular emphasis should be placed on: ‘originality of research’, ‘desirability of quick publication’, ‘clarity of presentation’, and ‘validity of conclusions’. Overall judgement of papers (‘tick one box’) was to be made under the categories: ‘outstanding’, ‘acceptable’ (with ‘major’ or ‘minor’ revisions), ‘marginal’, or ‘unacceptable’. Given the journal’s aim of rapid publication, referees were requested to return reviews with manuscripts within 2 weeks.

# 3.2. Data collection

It is axiomatic that only gatekeepers usually have access to gatekeeping discourse such as peer reviews or job and grant applications. Even if wider access to confidential data becomes possible, there may be a tacit understanding about how data may be exploited in a limited manner for research and teaching purposes. In the present case, I approached a Japanese advisory editor I had known for several years for an interview, and after explaining my specific research objectives and how I would use the data gathered, I requested access to a corpus of referees’ reports and authors’ point-by-point replies. I was given a recently completed batch of 21 submissions, completed in that they had either been through the full review process and had been accepted for publication, or the papers had been withdrawn by the authors after review. Papers were chronologically ordered by date of original receipt in the editor’s office, and I kept to this simple arrangement for my own purposes of analysis.

# 3.3. The corpus

The corpus consists of reports by 40 referees—15 Japanese, 25 English NSs (i.e. as far as could be judged)—divided into two groups depending on the initial judgement of referees regarding their suitability for rapid publication:

Group I consists of 22 reports (average length 199 words) of 15 papers which were all initially marked ‘acceptable’ with revisions (some reviewers had added with ‘minor’ or ‘major’ revisions). Seven papers had two reports each, eight papers only one. In all 15 cases, the revised versions of the manuscripts were accepted for publication. For Group I papers, the average time from receipt of paper to acceptance for publication was 14.6 weeks. Group II consists of 18 reports (average length 185 words) of six papers which were initially deemed ‘unacceptable’. One paper had one report, one had three, two had two, and two papers had five reports, indicating multiple revisions and re-submissions. However, only 1 paper was satisfactorily revised and accepted. The other five were withdrawn and were untraceable by author or title computer search, which implies that the technical content and/ or format of those papers was considerably re-worked due to the reasons for rejection. Gosden (2001) discusses these six papers in greater detail.

# 4. Referees’ reports

# 4.1. General format

Although there is no format for referees’ reports which has been standardized by journals or publishers, they often consist of a summarizing judgement regarding suitability for publication, followed by comments, sometimes numbered by point or page, which may track criticisms in a sequential manner from beginning to end of the manuscript. Editors expect authors to indicate clearly the revisions they have made in their re-submitted manuscripts and the most effective way to do this is for authors’ numbered replies to follow exactly referees’ numbered comments. However, Kerans (2001) points out organizational difficulties in following referees’ comments since referees do not always number their points—in the present corpus of 40 reviews, only in 18 were comments clearly numbered. An unnumbered style of review places a greater burden on NNSE authors, since this requires them to isolate discrete ‘point’ boundaries, before they can address them in their ‘point-by-point’ replies. The use of standardized forms and checklists is one idea that has been mentioned by professional science organizations in an attempt to improve the review format.

As with book reviews (Hyland, 2000), referees’ reports commonly open with ‘good news, bad news’, a praise/criticism pair, for example, in manuscripts marked ‘acceptable with revisions’: ‘This is an important contribution and warrants swift publication, however, some points need attention’. Or there is hedged praise: ‘Given the complexity of the ( $^ +$ Technical Detail), one’s major concern is with the analysis. In the circumstances, the authors appear to have done about as good a job as can be expected.’ The opening remarks to papers marked ‘unacceptable’ can be expected to reflect stronger judgments: ‘The paper does not seem to be worth publication in this journal.’ (Examples throughout are taken from the present corpus).

# 4.2. Descriptions of categories of referees’ comments

Analysis of the 40 reports in the corpus suggested that comments could first be categorized according to their reference to Technical Detail (TD), Claims (C), Discussion (D), References (R), and Format (F). For the present exploratory purposes, categories were identified and sub-divided according to the later criteria. Any comments by referees on ‘problems with the English’ are naturally of interest, but these were not coded in the present study (see Section 7).

# TECHNICAL DETAIL

Error or confusion (coded TDi)   
Referees pointed out (a) errors or (b) inconsistencies in technical detail (TD). (a) ‘I had the impression that authors think that $( + T D )$ . If so, the authors are wrong.’   
(b) ‘The authors quote $( + T D )$ value as 0.25. That in fact was for a different study.’   
Additional TD needed (TDii)   
Referees asked (a) direct or (b) implied questions to elicit further Technical Detail.   
(a) ‘Did the rate measurements start 1h after warming up the vessel?’   
(b) ‘No information is given about the band width of the laser.’

# CLAIMS

Doubting the significance of specific claims (Ci)   
Referees disagreed with specific claims which would have to be weakened to be acceptable.   
‘I think the authors are overly optimistic about $( + T D )$ .’   
‘I find the text about $( + T D )$ to be a slight over-interpretation of the Figure.’

Doubting the significance of general claims (Cii)

Referring more to the total body of published research, and/or to authors general claims, here referees questioned the overall significance of findings and hence the originality of the work. Comments in this category predominantly related to papers marked ‘unacceptable’.

‘I cannot appreciate the originality of the research.’   
‘There is not enough data to substantiate their claims (in fact hardly any data at   
all).’

# DISCUSSION

# Clarification sought (Di)

Referees requested further discussion in order to improve readers’ confidence in the results. Although it is often implicit that authors are being asked to clarify or add technical detail, the category Discussion is distinguished by referees’ explicit focus on asking authors to make their reports more convincing, attributing their concerns to ‘the reader’.

‘Could the authors expand the discussion on $( \dots + T D )$ . It would be helpful to the reader.’

‘Finally, the reader deserves $( + T D )$ in Table 1.’ Discussion is poor (Dii)

Referees pointed out an overall lack of clarity of discussion in manuscripts, and often appeared irritated by this. However, compared to comments in category Di, few concrete suggestions as to how to improve discussion were offered. As with sub-category Cii earlier, comments here also predominantly related to papers marked ‘unacceptable’.

‘The basic idea about $( + T D )$ can hardly be understood even qualitatively.’ ‘The authors write that $( + T D )$ . It’s very confusing in my opinion.’

# REFERENCES

# Addition or correction (Ri)

Referees indicated references that (a) should be added to update and thereby further strengthen the paper. This is particularly important given the function of Letters as a means of rapid communication in fast-moving scientific fields. (b) Omissions can be seen as criticism for a lack of awareness of related work, but may have been labeled an ‘oversight’ to save face. Finally, (c) errors in references also occurred with referees adding corrections.   
(a) ‘There is a recent paper $( +$ ref) dealing with this. Also X has just published another paper on this $^ { \prime } +$ ref).’   
(b) ‘This closely parallels the work of $^ { \prime } +$ ref). In what appears to be an oversight by the authors, no mention is made of this reference.’   
(c) ‘First reported by $( +$ ref) in 1981 and not the authors of refs. 1, 2.’ References questioning the originality of the research (Rii)   
Additional references also served to highlight the fact that key parts of the

authors’ research (a) may already have been reported elsewhere by others, (b) even by themselves. Comments therefore predominantly related to papers marked ‘unacceptable’.

(a) ‘The significant part of the experimental technique was already published   
(ref. 6).’   
(b) ‘The authors have already reported $( + T D )$ in ref. 5.’

# FORMAT

# Questioning the Letters format $( \mathrm { F i } )$

Here, although referees were often positive about the value of the research reported, they questioned whether the Letters journal was the appropriate place to publish the paper and suggested that the paper (a) should be shortened because of the 2500 word limit of a Letter format, or (b) should be expanded to make a full paper for a different journal.   
(a) ‘The manuscript contains about 4300 words instead of 2500 words.’ (b) ‘In my opinion the authors should complete a more detailed study.’ Internal organization (Fii)   
Comments related to the internal organization of sections of the paper. ‘I cannot understand why this report has to have such a redundant introduction.’

Inevitably, the coding of comments is not cut and dried, since some comments will appear to overlap or subsume others. For example, if a reviewer points out an additional Reference (Ri) that should be included in a revised version, it is likely that not only the reference itself will be added but any relevant Technical Detail from that paper. Since the main motivation behind this study is to elucidate for novice NNSE researchers how to interpret the ‘helpfulness’ of referees’ remarks in the task of revising their papers, the coding of functions here is guided by explicit mention. In the earlier example it is the cited reference which is the starting point for revision. Likewise, the categories of Claims and References are inevitably related, but whereas examples under both Cii and Rii would seem to cast doubt on the originality of authors’ research, the latter category would indicate a specific reference to substantiate this criticism.

In order to illustrate the process of coding and analysis, Section 4.2.1 presents a complete example of a referee’s numbered report marked ‘accept with revisions’.

4.2.1. A coded example of a referee’s report marked ‘accept after revisions’

[For the sake of economy, the referee’s report below is not reproduced in full, e.g. $( + \mathrm { T D } )$ indicates technical detail in the report that has been omitted here; ( $^ +$ new ref) indicates where the details of an additional reference were given in the original report but not included here].

This manuscript reports some interesting experiments and it is well written. Therefore it can be accepted for publication after minor modifications.

(1) There is a recent paper dealing with $( +$ Technical Detail) by ( $^ +$ new ref) that could be referenced.a Also, another paper on $( + T D )$ that has just been published should be added ( $^ +$ new ref).b

(2) The discovery of $( + T D )$ is quite nice! Since $F { - } C$ factors are thought not to be important, why does the $( + T D )$ change?c

(3) Could the authors expand the discussion regarding $( + T D )$ .d What pressure is required to observe $( + T D ) ! ^ { \mathit { p e } } I t$ would also be helpful to the reader if $( + T D )$ were quoted.f

(4) The authors for ref. 7 should be $^ { \prime } +$ ref).g

Coding of referee’s comments

a Ri — a new reference that ‘could’ be added to update the paper is suggested   
b Ri — as ina (except in this case it ‘should’ be added)   
c Di — further explanation elicited   
d Di — expanded discussion suggested   
e TDii — further TD requested by means of a direct question   
f Di — further TD ‘would also be helpful to the reader’   
g Ri — correction of reference

The unit of analysis here is generally a complete sentence, although one definable comment may spread over more than one sentence, and comments all contained in one numbered point may have different functions, for example, in numbered point (3), the referee first asks for expanded Discussion of a technical pointd, followed by a direct question to elicit further $\mathrm { T D ^ { e } }$ . The third sentence in point (3) clearly asks for $+ \textrm { T D }$ , but it is the explicit mention of $\cdot _ { I t }$ would also be helpful to the reader’ which suggests the initial motivation behind commentf as Discussion rather than as subsumed $+ \textrm { T D }$ .

# 5. The metafunctional orientation of referees’ comments

In order to revise their manuscripts effectively, NNSE novice researchers need to be able to appreciate the motivation for referees’ criticisms and for this reason, it is helpful to develop a sense of the functional orientation of referees’ comments. Halliday’s (1985) metafunctional organization of language provides us with a network for analyzing the interdependent relationships between the elements that comprise any communicative event, that is, broadly between a speaker/writer and the subject matter [ideational (experiential)], the audience [interpersonal], and options for text structure [textual]. In the specific case here of peer reviews, analysis of the metafunctional orientation of referees’ comments is expected to reveal whether they are more directed towards:

the technical content [ideational (experiential)];   
the general readability of the text and therefore the effectiveness of the writer’s interaction with the reader [interpersonal]; and

a structural aspect of the paper itself, for example, whether the paper, or one section of the paper, is too long [textual].

This information regarding the metafunctional balance of referees’ comments can be seen as instrumental in guiding an effective point-by-point revision process of manuscripts. Fig. 1 indicates how comments may be organized as realizations of Halliday’s (1985) metafunctions. In Fig. 1, the categorization of the subject matter, i.e. Technical Detail (TD) as ideational (experiential), and Format (F) as textual is straightforward. The categorization of comments relating to Claims (C), Discussion (D), and References (R) under interpersonal can be suggested in that such comments reflect the social construction and negotiation of the originality and value of authors’ research, as well as reflecting the appropriate rhetorical expression demanded in convincing readers of that value.

The approach adopted here complements previous analysis of the actual revisions made between submitted and published manuscripts in a corpus of research articles (Gosden, 1995). This broad use of Halliday’s metafunctions is guided by the practical need for transparency of application of any level of metalinguistic description in the EAP classroom and therefore my intention is to capture the essence of referees’ concerns in a commonsense way. A deeper clause-by-clause analysis of the coded example in Section 4.2.1 would clearly reveal a richer, more delicate multi-layered account of the meanings realized simultaneously by each metafunction, for example, textually in the thematic structure of referees’ reports (Gosden, 2002).

Table 1 gives the totals and percentages of referees’ comments by category and group in the corpus. Following the metafunctional organization suggested in Fig. 1, the data can be usefully summarized as Table 2. Thus we can see that fully twothirds $( 6 6 . 1 \% )$ of comments in the present corpus reflect an interactional, interpersonal orientation, with comments relating to Claims: ‘I think the authors are overly optimistic about $( + T D )$ .’; Discussion:‘‘Could the authors expand the discussion on $( \dots + T D )$ . $I t$ would be helpful to the reader.’ ; and References: ‘First reported by ( $^ +$ ref) in 1981 and not the authors of refs. 1, 2.’.

Table 2 also suggests that any differences in the ideational-interpersonal balance between Group I (‘accept with revisions’) and Group II (‘unacceptable’) papers are relatively minor, with the greater number of textual Format-related comments $( 1 0 . 6 \% )$ in Group II papers accounted for by the fact that some of these manuscripts were rejected due to their unsuitable length as a Letter.

# 6. Helpfulness for revision of referees’ comments

Clearly, the more a paper is considered ‘acceptable’ by referees, the more straightforward any revisions they request should be, since understanding what referees are asking authors to do will be relatively transparent. On the other hand, as referees’ criticisms become more general, reflecting greater perceived weaknesses in the overall manuscript and/or research itself, the more fundamental revisions would need to be, and the more difficult it would likely be for authors to extract help from referees’ comments.

As indicated earlier, many of the categories of referees’ comments were sub-divided: References (Ri and Rii), etc. This resulted from the fact that the same category of comment was used for different purposes, depending on the overall judgement of the paper. Thus, category Ri comments typically referred to additional references which were being suggested to strengthen and update papers marked ‘accept with revisions’. On the other hand, Rii comments referred to references of previously published research, which thus served to condemn the authors’ work as lacking originality and was consequently ‘unacceptable’. Categories C, D, and R, namely the interpersonal grouping relating to Claims, Discussion, and References all shared this dual function.

A basic distinction between referees’ comments then is the degree to which they will be helpful in assisting authors to improve their papers. Even if a reviewer’s tone seems highly critical (or occasionally rude and sarcastic), all comments concerned with Technical Detail (TDi and TDii), Ci, Di, and Ri share this positive commitment to revision. The resulting effect on the successful publication of papers is clearly illustrated in Table 3. By comparing the helpfulness of comments in the two groups of papers, we can see that the vast majority $( 9 0 . 4 \% )$ of comments in manuscripts initially marked ‘accept with revisions’ was designed to help authors make revisions, compared to under half $( 4 7 . 1 \% )$ in the ‘unacceptable’ group. Table 3 indicates that the percentage of comments relating to Technical Detail is approximately one quarter in both groups. The principal difference therefore is due to the nearly three times greater number of comments relating to the interpersonal category $( \mathrm { C i } + \mathrm { D i } + \mathrm { R i } )$ . This degree of helpfulness for revision reflects the degree of commitment involved in referees’ and editors’ continued engagement with authors. ‘Conversations between community-situated individuals’ (Hyland, 2001, p. 307) are at the heart of academic writing. In contrast, the fact that only one of the 6 initially rejected papers (Group II) was successfully revised and accepted for publication by the same Letters journal (Gosden, 2001), and only after four revised versions and 25 weeks, highlights the struggle involved in revising papers when first review comments are designed to distance gatekeepers from authors’ ‘unacceptable’ work and further dialogue.

# 7. Referees’ comments on English Language

Although prospective authors are commonly advised to read carefully the target journal’s ‘Instructions to Authors’, there is rarely specific guidance for NNSE authors on language and style. In a survey of 500 journals, Kirkman (2001) noted the general vagueness of advice, such as that the English should be ‘good’, ‘idiomatic’, ‘standard’, ‘uniform’, ‘proper’, or ‘the style should be lively, concise, readable’, all of which is of little practical value. On the other hand, comments that referees may make on problems with English in submitted manuscripts are naturally of interest to NNSE authors, since they are assumed to be more directly helpful in polishing manuscripts as part of the revision process.

Table 3 Helpfulness of referees’ comments for revision by category and groupa   

<html><body><table><tr><td>Categories</td><td>Group I % of comments</td><td>Group II % of comments</td></tr><tr><td>Ideational (TDi + TDii)</td><td>27.9</td><td>25.0</td></tr><tr><td>Interpersonal (Ci + Di + Ri)</td><td>62.5</td><td>22.1</td></tr><tr><td>Totals</td><td>90.4</td><td>47.1</td></tr></table></body></html>

a Group $\mathrm { I } =$ ‘accept with revisions’: Group $\mathrm { I I } =$ ‘unacceptable’.

In the present corpus, only 18 out of 40 reports commented on some aspect of English language and style (13 of 22 in Group I and 5 of 18 in Group II). Some did indeed make specific suggestions: ‘last line, p.3 is unclear because the final clause isn’t set off with a conjunction, such as the word ‘but’’. Some offered practical help with returned manuscripts: ‘there are several typographical errors, which should be corrected and a number of stylistic changes can be made to improve the manuscript. These are noted in red ink on the manuscript.’ But the majority of referees who did comment (10 of 18) only referred to general problems: ‘there are a number of minor grammatical errors floating around on almost every page’; or ‘the authors should try to improve the English’.

In her study, Kourilova´ (1996) noted that criticism by NSE reviewers, even though often blunt or caustic, was only rarely unsubstantiated. A major exception, however, concerned critical remarks on English language and style. She suggests this is understandable, as reviewers are not language sub-editors, many do not consider themselves language experts, and are often unable to pinpoint what makes a paper written by a NNSE unidiomatic. From her perspective as an author’s editor, Kerans (2001) emphasizes this point that NSE reviewers may lack the appropriate metalanguage needed to talk in greater detail about specific linguistic and rhetorical difficulties. However, Kourilova´ (1996) reminds us that, quite opposite to generalized comments, referees sometimes express surprisingly forceful and very specific statements on language and style—‘How dare you use the past tense’—although one might equally question whether authors were likely to find such comments helpful.

# 8. Concluding remarks

The main observation from this study, that much critical feedback from referees may be oriented towards revisions whose underlying rationale is more interpersonal than ideational/technical in nature, is often surprising to graduate students in my EAP classes. Misreading the rhetorical purposes behind referees’ comments may lead novice authors to underplay the interactively complex nature of peer reviews, with the likely consequences being that they may not fathom referees’ concerns sufficiently clearly. Indeed, with their first experiences of submitting papers to international journals for publication, students may approach me with their referees’ reports, explaining that they generally understood the scientific points of discussion, and the surface English, but they were not quite sure what they were being invited to do, often due to conflicting signals. For example, one of the papers in the corpus was described as ‘interesting’, ‘carefully studied’, and ‘sound enough’; but then the referee went on to comment that the basic idea underlying the research could ‘hardly be understood’. Learning to decipher the lines and inferences between the lines of referees’ comments, applying appropriate rhetorical strategies in their own point-bypoint replies, and balancing an approach of compliance and resistance towards making revisions (Gosden, 2001), are all skills which require considerable practice. In fact, for many NNSE researchers, the linguistic and rhetorical skills required for such research process tasks are likely to be much more complex than those required for the core activity of writing research papers, a task with which they at least can often get some help.

In the not too distant future, it seems likely that the nature of print and electronic publishing will change significantly: ‘Like it or not, the days of ink on paper are numbered—and the number is smaller than many people imagine’ (Nature, 1999). However, it is also thought that with the more open access of electronic networks, with preprint servers requiring only ‘soft review’, i.e., screening of articles, the significance of print journals’ quality-controlling, gatekeeping roles will likely increase. Clearly, today’s novice researchers will need to become aware of the possible impact that electronic publishing may have on peer assessment and research writing practices in the future. Here is a view from European Science Editing (2001, p. 36) of what a less occluded process of peer review might look like: Original manuscripts are put on the Web, with reviewers’ signed opinions, editorial comments, and correspondence between the journal and authors—thus, the full history of the paper since submission is available on the Website. The final step occurs when the Web process of peer review is available world-wide ‘as it happens’, with the review process itself thereby becoming more immediate, transparent, and more a part of the ‘full story’.

In such a scenario, effective cross-cultural communication skills which will need to be demonstrated ‘online’ across a variety of supporting research process genres such as peer reviews and academic correspondence (Flowerdew & Dudley-Evans, 1999) will be at a premium. Consequently, in the early stages of their professional life, novices need to be exposed to as broad a range as possible of appropriate interactional tasks to encourage the development of the required skills—the kinds of tasks that Swales and Feak (2000) in English in Today’s Research World label under headings, such as ‘academic communications in support of the research process’ and ‘academic communications in support of a research career’. Such approaches can help to develop further socio-cultural sensitivity and pragma-linguistic competence, qualities that Kourilova´ (1996) emphasizes are necessary prerequisites for young researchers to be able to fit in both professionally and socially as members of a rapidly changing scientific community.
