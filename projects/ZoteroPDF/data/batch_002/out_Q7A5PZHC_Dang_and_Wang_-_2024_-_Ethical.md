Given the rapid development in Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies, conver sations regarding how these tools will shape the teaching and learning of writing can be difficult to unpack. Thus, higher-ed institutions across the U.S. are paying more attention to the discussion of GenAI in their own contexts and also establishing guidelines to support instructors and students in this GenAI era. To understand more about the direction of these universities, this research brief examines publicly available statements and resources from 100 U.S. universities on the teaching of writing and GenAI usage, and from there, guide institutions in developing effective strategies for the responsible implementation of these tools. This report also highlights the importance of including L2 students as a focus in the process of crafting these statements, especially when viewing GenAI through the lens of critical pedagogy, social justice and inequalities.

# 1. Introduction

In recent years, Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies such as Open AI’s ChatGPT have grown substantially with numerous applications in different fields, including education. For example, GenAI can now assist teachers with teaching preparation and feedback provision, ultimately reducing teaching workloads and streamlining the teaching process (Bonner et al., 2023). Specifically, leveraging an extensive corpus of textual data, GenAI can help with preparing teaching materials and activities, such as generating handouts and discussion questions, accommodating language to match students’ proficiency levels, generating writing samples for analysis, and creating rubrics for evaluating student writing (Pack & Maloney, 2023). However, similar to any other new technology, there will always be hesitation coming from teachers, especially considering the complexity and ethical concerns of GenAI (Barrett & Pack, 2023). Concerns regarding academic integrity and plagiarism are at the forefront of these discussions, as there is no explicit guidance on how to accommodate GenAI integration, especially when it comes to writing-intensive courses (Perkins, 2023; Sullivan et al., 2023). Thus, it is important for institutions to provide teachers with resources and training on the effective use of GenAI in their teaching.

In addition, GenAI can also help students throughout their writing processes, including planning, writing, and revising; or provide students with immediate and personalized responses to address their needs from linguistic nuances to genre-specific features (Chan & Hu, 2023). Thus, given all the possibilities with GenAI, the education sector started to worry about what students are taking away from their learning and writing process (Barrett & Pack, 2023). Moreover, the language generated by GenAI tools can lead to the reinforcement of White Mainstream English as the standard and amplify hegemonic bias towards marginalized students (Bender, 2021). Available tools to detect GenAI are reported to have bias against second language (L2) students, resulting in L2 students’ writing being caught as GPT (Liang et al., 2023). Experiences with GenAI-assisted writing activities reveal that its output, such as inaccurate references, can be quite misleading for L2 student writers and that they prefer more transparency when it comes to the sources of GenAI’s responses (Liu et al., 2024). Some students also raise concerns about inequity and impaired learning motivation (Yan, 2023).

The nuances of GenAI from both instructors and students highlight the need for recommendations regarding the use of GenAI that is situated within their own contexts. However, existing research regarding universities’ responsibilities and strategies for GenAI usage is limited. Wang et al. (2024) focus on exploring how universities respond to the development of GenAI in their general educational contexts. They find that numerous universities adopt an open but cautious approach to GenAI incorporation, and suggest educators explore and design discipline-specific resources. Given that, we extend the conversation by analyzing how U.S. universities established their current GenAI statements in relation to writing contexts and L2 students specifically. In this research report, we examine publicly available statements from 100 U.S. universities regarding GenAI and the teaching of writing. We then discuss current pedagogical approaches for linguistically diverse students as well as address the ethical use of GenAI for L2 writing practices.

Research questions

1. What guidance do U.S. universities have for their instructors on the use of GenAI for the teaching of writing? 2. What strategies do U.S. universities provide to their instructors to either encourage or discourage the use of GenAI in writing practices? 3. What cautions do U.S. universities provide to their instructors on the use of GenAI when working with L2 students?

# 2. Method

This study offers an analysis of 100 U.S. universities’ publicly available statements on the use of GenAI for the teaching of writing, and from there, provides insights into how these universities established their positions on practical, pedagogical, and ethical concerns of GenAI related to L2 students. To achieve this, we first identified the top 121 national universities in the U.S. via U.S. News (2023).

We chose to focus on national universities instead of other types of institutions, universities, or colleges (e.g., national liberal arts colleges, regional universities, regional colleges, etc.) because of their degree offerings with a range of bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral programs (U.S. News, 2023). While we recognize that these universities cannot provide a comprehensive view of all GenAI statements in the U.S. and worldwide, we are hopeful that this study can initiate conversations regarding the available resources for navigating GenAI in writing practices.

After selecting all the universities for analysis, we then established our search strategy on Google using a list of keywords together with the name of each university: GenAI statement for teaching writing, GenAI use for writing, GenAI teaching resources, Guidance on GenAI use for teaching; Writing in the classroom with GenAI. After this first round of searching, we then refined our data based on the sources for each statement. We were interested in documents provided by the university instead of individual departments or colleges (e.g., Office of Provost, Academic Affairs, Center for Teaching and Learning, etc.). Official documents from these sources offered insights into each university’s stance and direction toward GenAI and that it is agreeable upon all departments within that university. This meant if we were to come across a statement on the use of GenAI from a College of Engineering, we wouldn’t include it in our data for analysis. We excluded articles or blog posts that were produced by individual authors on news sites from these universities. In addition, some universities only provided information for their faculty and students without making it public; therefore, if we couldn’t access the information, we would also exclude that resource from our list.

Both researchers went through the data collection process separately (searching for documents and refining search results). In the end, we compared our results and agreed upon a finalized list of statements from each university. The timeline for data collection was from February 28th, 2024, to April 1st, 2024. We acknowledge that as GenAI continues to develop, these universities will update their policies and statements. However, this study is limited to the documents we collected as of April 1st, 2024, and we wouldn’t be able to account for changes upon this point. Out of the 121 universities, 21 universities didn’t have any official information on GenAI policy and GenAI use for teaching writing. Thus, we were left with a total of 100 universities for analysis (see Data availability).

Given our research questions, we adopted a thematic analysis approach (Braun & Clarke, 2006) for our coding process. To start off, we looked at the first 10 universities on our list and individually came up with a list of codes related to our research questions, which focused on how these universities established their positions on writing practices and L2 students in their GenAI statements. We then discussed, compared, and refined our codes to reflect new insights and themes from the data. To code the data, we assigned a point system to each code. This meant each code was considered one point and if a university provided information that fell under that code, they would receive one point (Table 1 showed a mock-up coding for University X). We acknowledged that different universities would have very different positions on some of these categories. For example, under the category “Academic Integrity, Disclosure, & Intellectual Property” of AI literacy (see Table 1), while one university could focus on providing students with guidance on how to disclose information in their writing that was generated by GenAI, another university could focus on describing the potential for academic integrity violations when students used GenAI in their writing. Thus, depending on the university, there would be mention of academic integrity issues that did or did not reveal a stance or the depth of understanding inscribed in the policy. However, for the purpose of this study, the coding system was developed to account for whether or not these universities provided information in relation to each category, knowing that each university might not share the same position and/or approach. This system was also developed to account for the fact that one university could have multiple areas of focus in their GenAI statements, thus, we would be able to calculate the total number of universities that provided information for each area in our codebook. For inter-rater reliability (IRR) check, two researchers used the codebook and the point system to code 20 universities separately. The results from this round of coding showed complete agreement between both researchers. The first researcher then used the codebook (see Table 1) to code the whole data set, then the second researcher did another round of coding based on the results from the first researcher. In the end, to verify our results one last time, we went through the results together to discuss any discrepancies.

# 3. Findings and discussion

# 3.1. Guidance on the use of GenAI for the teaching of writing

As for the focus of this article, we examined whether these U.S. universities’ statements on the use of GenAI mentioned writing as one of their foci. From our analysis, we noticed that all universities prioritized the teaching of writing in their GenAI guidelines. This meant that information on writing and GenAI was provided throughout their statements on either one or multiple areas as followed: 1) providing syllabus guidelines, 2) providing information for engaging with critical AI literacy, 3) providing guidance on the use of detection software, 4) providing strategies for teaching writing, and 5) providing information related to L2 students.

![](img/bf5b2d925ec34c82121cfa90d1231896cdea2dfe2d1f2e6a297b1491a5c59f43.jpg)  
Fig. 1. Different critical AI literacy categories mentioned in universities’ statements.

Ninety-eight out of 100 universities in our dataset provided instructors with critical AI literacy information, focusing on both the benefits and drawbacks of GenAI usage. We defined critical AI literacy in this article as an approach to help students recognize the limitations and potential of AI, and from there understand their choices when using it (Gupta et al., 2024). Given the concerns regarding how GenAI could promote plagiarism (Perkins, 2023; Sullivan et al., 2023) or bias towards marginalized students (Bender, 2021), we were looking specifically at how these universities shaped their instructors’ understanding of GenAI concerns related to writing practices. Fig. 1 shows the different categories of critical AI literacy and the number of universities that mentioned each category in their statements. Concerns related to Academic Integrity, Disclosure & Intellectual Property was the highest $8 6 \%$ , $\begin{array} { r }  \bar { \bf n } = 8 4 \ \end{array}$ ) while Workload & Balance received the least attention at $1 7 ~ \%$ $\mathrm { ( n { = } 1 7 }$ ).

Ninety-three out of 100 universities on our list suggested instructors to include information about GenAI in their course syllabus, with $7 2 \%$ $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } = 6 7 )$ ) provided sample statements for the use of GenAI in the classroom (e.g., GenAI tools are prohibited, GenAI tools are permitted for certain tasks, GenAI tools are permitted). Eighty-five percent $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } = 7 9 )$ ) provided instructors with information on citing the use of GenAI. This showed an emphasis on GenAI and citation as many universities established their own guidelines on how to cite the use of GenAI. For example, Northwestern University suggested instructors to request from students a disclosure statement at the end of an assignment explaining: 1) what the students used GenAI for; 2) the specific tool(s) they used; and 3) what prompts they used to get the results (Artificial Intelligence at Northwestern, 2024). Some universities directed instructors to external sources such as MLA or APA citation guidelines to help with the development of their classroom citation practices. Overall, while citing the use of GenAI is referenced heavily, there is no agreed-upon practice that can be applied at a larger scale at least for now.

To understand more about the incorporation of GenAI in the teaching of writing, we also examined how these universities addressed the conversation regarding pedagogical approaches in their statements. We noticed that 97 out of 100 universities on our list provided instructors with strategies to teach writing in the midst of GenAI. For this, we only considered strategies with the mention of writing specifically. This revealed that the majority of these universities paid great attention to writing practices when developing their GenAI guidelines. Two main themes emerged from these strategies: 1) Classroom design that can be GenAI resistant and/or deterring the misuse of GenAI and, 2) Classroom design that allows for the incorporation of GenAI. In Section 3.2, we will discuss these strategies in more detail.

Along with strategies for teaching writing, 77 out of 100 universities provided instructors with guidance on whether to use or not to use detection software to detect GenAI use in students’ writing. Among these universities, $7 9 \%$ $\scriptstyle \mathbf { n } = 6 1$ ) declared in their statements that instructors were not allowed to use detection software to detect the use of GenAI in students’ assignment submissions. Most of them referred to the fact that detection software at this time were not trustworthy as they could provide false positives and that inputting students’ submissions into these systems could potentially lead to privacy issues and violations of students’ intellectual property rights. The remaining $2 1 \ \%$ $_ { ( \mathrm { n = 1 6 } }$ ) stated in their statements that instructors were allowed to use detection software to detect the use of GenAI in students’ assignment submissions. However, these universities also recommended instructors to use these tools with deliberation, especially when determining whether students engaged in plagiarism. This showed great caution from universities when considering GenAI, especially if it could harm students.

Lastly, this study was interested in understanding how these universities dealt with the relationship between GenAI and their L2 student population. As GenAI tools can both empower and marginalize students, it is important for each university to establish their position on the use of GenAI in relation to their L2 students. However, only 48 out of 100 universities in our study provided an explicit focus on L2 students in their discussion of GenAI usage. For this, we looked at where and how these universities mentioned L2 students as a point of reference in their statements. In Section 3.3, we will unpack the different areas in which L2 students were discussed. With only half of the universities on our list included L2 students in their statements, it raised a question of where L2 students stand in the discussion regarding the ethical use of GenAI tools.

# 3.2. Strategies for teaching writing in the GenAI era

The majority of the universities $9 7 \%$ , $\scriptstyle \mathtt { n } = 9 7$ ) in our dataset provided instructors with strategies to teach writing in the GenAI era. As mentioned in Section 3.1, we divided these strategies into two main categories. For the first category, we focused on strategies that guided instructors to redesign their classrooms in ways that GenAI would not be much applicable or effective for students to solve

![](img/6a0aa72d0cd9760a4bbb292889d63a42923aabadfa71aa5b312c7423bb7061c7.jpg)  
Fig. 2. Strategies for classroom design that can be GenAI resistant.

problems in their assignments (see Fig. 2).

As shown in Fig. 2, the universities on our list put a strong emphasis on providing instructors with strategies to personalize their assignments $( 7 7 \%$ , $\scriptstyle \mathtt { n } = 7 5$ ). This strategy included but not limited to establishing assignments such as reflection, context-specific prompt, discipline-specific prompt, etc. For example, Boston University suggested instructors to “create assignments (or compo nents of the assignment) that ask students to connect to a current event or community-related activity; or incorporate questions that connect students’ personal experiences with specific class materials” (Boston University Center for Teaching & Learning, 2023).

Followed by a close second was a focus on process-based learning with $7 2 \%$ $\mathrm { ( n = 7 0 ) }$ ), which included strategies such as brain storming, having multiple drafts, peer-reviewing, writing conferences, revising, etc. In addition, these universities also suggested instructors to consider redefining assignments’ objectives $7 0 \%$ , $\scriptstyle \mathtt { n = 6 8 }$ ), for example, aligning their assignments’ objectives with students’ needs, explaining to students the reasons behind each assignment, offloading tasks that are not necessary for students’ development in the course, etc. Strategies for redesigning assessment practices were at $6 8 \%$ $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } = 6 6$ ). These strategies focused on making changes to instructors’ current assessment practices, such as incorporating grades for low-stake assignments, avoiding putting a large sum of grades into one assignment, adopting authentic assessment practices, etc. Lastly, some universities recommended in structors to have different classroom and assignment modalities $6 0 \%$ , $\scriptstyle \mathtt { n } = 5 8$ ). This included assignments such as podcasts, presentations, oral discussions, flipped-classroom models, etc.

While these strategies might not be new to many composition instructors, when we look at writing across curriculum and disci plines, this shows a movement toward writing as a process rather than a product. Faculty across disciplines can use these strategies to set up writing assignments that provide students with opportunities for feedback and revision, instead of policing one big paper at the end of the semester.

For the second category, we looked at strategies that encouraged instructors to redesign their classrooms to utilize GenAI for students’ development (see Fig. 3).

The number one strategy suggested by these universities for GenAI incorporation was for instructors to discuss GenAI explicitly with their students $8 2 \%$ , $\scriptstyle \mathtt { n } = 8 0$ ). These universities believed that to establish a productive relationship between students and GenAI, there needed to be conversations happening in the classroom about GenAI for each assignment and classroom activity. Also, intro ducing students to the benefits and drawbacks of GenAI for their learning was mentioned as an important aspect. Thus, it seems to be that informing students of critical AI literacy has become prominent in many universities.

Coming in number second was strategies for engaging GenAI in students’ learning at $7 9 \%$ $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } = 7 7$ ). We noticed that these strategies meant many things, such as asking students to analyze GenAI outputs, allowing students to use GenAI for certain parts of the as signments, comparing their writing with GenAI’s writing, guiding students to use AI tools for analyzing large datasets, creating visuals of findings, and discussing patterns, anomalies, and insights. However, knowing about these strategies and possessing the skills to make them happen can look very different for instructors.

Not only that, universities also expressed that instructors should stay updated with GenAI developments to recreate similar ex periences in the classroom for their students $6 5 \%$ , $\scriptstyle \mathtt { n } = 6 3$ ). For example, many universities suggested instructors to test their assignment prompts in different GenAI tools to understand the outputs produced by GenAI, to use GenAI to generate ideas for course activities, or to produce explanations of course concepts that students may find challenging to understand.

Lastly, a small number of universities $3 3 \%$ , $\scriptstyle \mathtt { n } = 3 2$ ) provided information on using GenAI as teaching assistants for tasks such as assisting in grading students’ works, tutoring students and providing feedback to students. Within this, $8 3 ~ \%$ $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } = 2 8 )$ ) stated that they would allow instructors to use GenAI as teaching assistants and $1 2 \%$ $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } = 4 )$ indicated discouragement of such use.

Overall, as GenAI is here to stay, providing instructors with strategies for the incorporation of GenAI in their classroom contexts seems to be a step in the right direction. But unlike strategies that instructors can build on based on their existing content and ex periences, acquiring the skills to develop assignments that incorporate GenAI meaningfully might add extra burden and stress to instructors’ day-to-day workload. Workload & Balance for both instructors and students when engaging with new and emerging technologies was also the category that received the least attention from our list of universities (see Section 3.1). Thus, as Cornell University has nicely put, universities should “recognize the additional burden on instructors to adapt to the rapidly changing effects of GAI on education and provide additional support to teaching faculty and staff” (Cornell University Center for Teaching Innovation, 2023).

# 3.3. Guidance on the use of GenAI and L2 students

Fifty-two out of 100 universities in our dataset did not provide any information on L2 students in their discussion of GenAI usage.

![](img/756e329c7be6129c48920a1c3601325a2f65eecee147927874cc543af5bcbafa.jpg)  
Fig. 3. Strategies for classroom design that allows for GenAI incorporation.

Compared to the attention given to other areas of writing practices as seen in Section 3.1, it is apparent that L2 students are not receiving the attention needed in the development of many GenAI statements, especially when it comes to issues such as GenAI language having bias towards marginalized students, GenAI detection tools falsely accusing L2 students of cheating or L2 students not knowing how to interpret GenAI outputs given their previous literacy experiences. This clearly speaks to the need for universities to provide their instructors and students with guidance on not only how to use GenAI but also how to use it in a way that accounts for linguistic differences.

Among the 48 universities that included information on L2 students and GenAI usage, we were interested in the type of content that   
was discussed. There were four areas that we found to be the most prominent in our analysis when it came to the relationship between   
L2 students and GenAI: 1) Critical AI literacy; 2) Inclusive teaching approaches; 3) Detection Software; and 4) Assessment practices. Within these areas, $6 0 ~ \%$ $\scriptstyle ( \mathtt { n } = 2 9 )$ ) provided information on what it meant to engage in critical AI literacy for L2 students. The   
discussions in these statements focused on providing information on how GenAI could reproduce non-inclusive language and biases   
against L2 student population, how GenAI preferred Standard American English, how GenAI could turn other dialects and writing   
styles into disadvantages, etc. While many other universities mentioned bias and stereotypes under their critical AI literacy infor   
mation (see Section 3.1), a lot of them didn’t give any further information on what type of bias and stereotypes that could occur.

Twenty-four universities $( 5 0 \% )$ focused on providing information about how instructors could adopt inclusive teaching ap proaches and encourage L2 students to embrace GenAI in their classrooms. This included but not limited to allowing L2 students to incorporate translation and editing aspects of GenAI into their writing process, discussing the issues of GenAI through the lens of L2 students, asking students to examine how GenAI tools use and produce data, etc. Seventeen universities $( 3 5 \% )$ mentioned the potential bias that detection software could have on L2 students, specifically on the misclassification of L2 writing as AI-generated. Lastly, only 7 universities $( 1 5 \% )$ focused on how assessment should be viewed in relation to GenAI and L2 students. These universities suggested instructors to avoid over-reliance on hand-written deliverables, in-class evaluation, or oral exams as these could cause more problems than solutions, especially in terms of access and equity. In addition, there was mention of how instructors could adopt assessment practices that promote more equitable evaluation of learning through connections and processes.

While this showed a direction toward treating L2 students as a main point of discussion, there was only a limited number of universities on our list that provided guidance for their instructors. Thus, we believe that information regarding pedagogical approaches to L2 students and GenAI needs to be discussed more openly, especially from the administrators to legitimize students’ sociohistorical experiences at each university.

# 4. Implications and conclusion

Results from this report revealed: 1) different ways that universities integrated the practical, pedagogical, and ethical concerns in their GenAI statements for the teaching of writing; 2) strategies for writing assignment design to both minimize the negative impact of GenAI and embrace the possibilities that GenAI can offer; and 3) cautions (or lack thereof) for teachers when working with L2 students. This study suggests university administrators and educators to consider all of these following areas when developing guidelines for GenAI integration.

# 4.1. Providing syllabus guidelines for the use of GenAI and GenAI detection software

Almost all of the universities on our list (93 out of 100) suggested their instructors to include information about GenAI in their course syllabus, ranging from sample statements to guidance on citing the use of GenAI. However, not all universities focused on establishing a clear system on what students can do with GenAI and how much of that can be documented and accounted for. In addition, students are also not informed about the use of GenAI detection software in their own classroom. We believe that trans parency in the use of GenAI should first come from the direction we provide to our students. Thus, we recommend universities and educators to specify in their syllabus policy the following information:

• When is GenAI use permitted or prohibited and why?   
• How will students disclose and cite their GenAI usage (what students use GenAI for, what GenAI tools they use, what GenAI prompts they generate, etc.)?   
• Where can students look for resources regarding the use of GenAI in their assignment (instructors’ office hours, links to different websites such as MLA, APA for citation guideline, library resources, official university statements, etc.)?   
• How will GenAI detection tools be used in the classroom (if being used at all)? And what that process will look like for students? What type of information will be used by GenAI detection tools? What will students need to do if their writing is flagged as GenAI?

# 4.2. Engaging with critical AI literacy

While critical AI literacy is at the forefront of the GenAI discussion provided by universities in our dataset, the weight putting in each category is definitely not the same, with concerns related to Academic Integrity, Disclosure & Intellectual Property being the highest $8 6 \%$ , ${ \mathfrak { n } } = 8 4 { \mathfrak { i } }$ ) while Workload & Balance receiving the least attention at $1 7 \ \%$ $\mathrm { \Delta } \mathrm { n } { = } 1 7 \mathrm { \Delta }$ ) (see Fig. 1). Thus, we argue that universities should pay attention to each of these categories equally, especially in terms of providing explanations and examples for both instructors and students. For example, universities should define what Equity and Access through the lens of GenAI means for their context, the affordances and constraints of GenAI for Equity and Access, and what instructors and students should consider about

Equity and Access when engaging with GenAI.

# 4.3. Pedagogical strategies for teaching and learning writing with GenAI

Many pedagogical strategies were discussed between these universities for both GenAI-Resistant and GenAI-Inclusive classrooms (see Table 2). While the list in Table 2 is not at all exhaustive, we believe that it can be served as a good starting point to build on and expand further. In all, we advocate for universities to continue to provide instructors with different resources to keep up with the new GenAI scene, especially with consideration to the local context and local needs of their students. Examples and directions on how to engage with each strategy are also important to maintain reasonable workloads and flexibility on the teachers’ parts.

# 4.4. L2 students and GenAI guidance

Finally, we argue that the critical engagement with GenAI needs to start with acknowledging the different student population being impacted by GenAI explicitly. With only half of the universities on our list mentioned L2 students in their GenAI guidance, transparent guidelines from institutions that can address linguistically diverse communities are needed in order to establish a more sustainable conversation for GenAI use in academic contexts. Guidance on L2 students and GenAI can mean many things, including but not limited to:

• Information on what it means to engage with GenAI for L2 students critically (e.g., GenAI reproducing non-inclusive language and biases against L2 student population, GenAI preferring Standard American English over other dialects and writing styles).   
• Information on how GenAI can be incorporated in classrooms with L2 students (e.g., allowing L2 students to incorporate translation and editing aspects of GenAI into their writing process, discussing the issues of GenAI through the lens of L2 students, asking students to examine how GenAI tools use and produce data).   
• Information on potential bias that GenAI detection software can have on L2 students (e.g., misclassifying L2 writing as AIgenerated).   
• Information on how assessment looks like in relation to GenAI and L2 students (e.g., avoid over-reliance on over-reliance on handwritten deliverables, in-class evaluation, or oral exams).   
• Information on different resources that instructors and L2 students can learn more about the relationship between GenAI and L2 students.

In sum, this report responds to the need for understanding how U.S. universities’ perceptions of GenAI and writing practices are presented in their official statements. It also allows for conversation regarding how L2 students are being viewed in the GenAI era and advocates for the importance of making L2 students’ voices more prominent in the crafting of universities’ guidelines and practices. Due to the limitation in our dataset (100 U.S. national universities), we hope to see future exploration into other contexts to gauge the ever-evolving discourse of GenAI, and from there continue to build support for instructors and students in L2 writing and beyond.

Table 2 Strategies for GenAI-Resistant and GenAI-Inclusive classrooms.   

<html><body><table><tr><td>GenAI-Resistant strategies</td><td>GenAI-Inclusive strategies</td></tr><tr><td>Personalized assignments: Establishing assignments such as reflection, context- specific prompt, discipline-specific prompt, local and personal prompt, etc.</td><td>Discussing GenAI explicitly with students: Having conversations with students about GenAI for each assignment and classroom activity, introducing students to the benefits and drawbacks of GenAI for their learning, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Process-based learning: Brainstorming, having multiple drafts, peer-reviewing, writing conferences, revising, etc.</td><td>Engaging GenAI in students&#x27; learning: Asking students to analyze GenAI outputs, allowing students to use GenAI for certain parts of the assignments, comparing their writing with GenAI&#x27;s writing, guiding students to use AI tools for analyzing large datasets, creating visuals of findings, and discussing patterns, anomalies, and insights, etc.</td></tr><tr><td>Redefining assignments&#x27; objectives: Aligning their assignments&#x27; objectives with students&#x27; needs, explaining to students the reasons behind each assignment, offloading tasks that are not necessary for students&#x27; development in the course, etc.</td><td>Staying updated with GenAI developments: Test their assignment prompts in different GenAI tools to understand the outputs produced by GenAI, using GenAI to generate ideas for course activities, producing explanations of course</td></tr><tr><td>Redesigning assessment practices: Making changes to instructors&#x27; current assessment practices, such as incorporating grades for low-stake assignments, avoiding putting a large sum of grades into one assignment, adopting authentic assessment practices, etc. Different classroom and assignment modalities: Establishing assignments such</td><td>concepts that students may find challenging to understand, etc. Using GenAI as teaching assistants: Assisting in grading students&#x27; works, tutoring students and providing feedback to students, etc.</td></tr></table></body></html>
