Medical eponyms can sometimes function as false friends, endangering communication. We demonstrate this by examining a selection of 50 medical phenomena in 8 languages for which eponyms, simple or complex ones, exist. The vast majority of medical eponyms are true friends. However, we have detected several types of false friends. Eponymic false friends in medical terminology may arise through clipping or truncation of the appellative or of a complex eponymic core. False friends may also come into existence through the confusion caused by auto-hyponymy. Finally, in addition to the choice between eponymic cores of variable complexity, there may also be alternatives that form a set of synonyms. Translation of the latter type of term may result in unwarranted introduction of a pseudoeponym. This means that terminological variation, synonymy and homonymydthe notorious undesirables in terminologydare the hotbed of the majority of problems that may be described as false–friend relationship. We also suggest some pedagogical strategies that may help mitigate the problem of false friends in MELF contexts. These are based on recent insights from SLA and cognitively oriented research on the phenomenon of false friends, i.e., they integrate affective, cognitive and conative aspects of learning.

# 1. Introduction

A sizeable portion of medical terms (estimated to range between 7,000 and 8,000) are eponymic in nature, containing the name of a person or a place related in some way to the phenomenon denoted by the term. Despite being part of medical terminology, medical eponyms exhibit a great deal of variation (cf. Lon-car and Ostro-ski, 2014). What is more, they can function as false friends, effectively endangering communication in medical environments. Sets of words belonging to different languages but exhibiting a certain degree of formal similarity are referred to as friends or cognates, which can be true or false, depending on whether there is indeed a significant degree of semantic overlap, on the one hand, or only a deceptive partial overlap or no overlap at all, on the other. They are of course problematic not only for translators, or lexicographers, but also for learners of a second or a foreign language in general as well as for learners of a language for special purposes.

A number of types of false friends can be discerned in the case of medical eponyms. In one type of situation, an eponymic term is used in one language, but not in another, e.g., it may be attested in the mother tongue of the student/medical expert, but absent in MELF (Medical English as a Lingua Franca, as broadly defined in Tweedie and Johnson, 2022, p. 17), its equivalent being a biologically descriptive term. The student/medical expert may overgeneralize and carry over the eponymic term into its MELF repertoire. Another variation, and opportunity for misunderstandings/errors is when one and the same medical phenomenon is denoted by different eponyms is different languages (e.g., the English terms Graves’ disease and Parry disease, as synonyms, correspond to Gravesova bolest in Croatian (true friends), but to Morbus Basedow or Basedowsche Krankheit in German, to maladie Basedow in French and to Basedowa bolezen in Slovenian, while it is called enfermedad de Graves-Basedow in Spanish, boala Basedow-Graves in Romanian, and malattia Flaiani-Basedow-Graves in Italian (note the different orderings of Graves and Basedow).

Eponymic false friends or confusables may be a serious problem in communication between medical practitioners, in the communication between medical practitioners and patients, as well as in the translation of medical communication. Let us refer to some such problems discussed in the literature. Pritchard et al. (2003) discuss a pair of confusable eponyms, Langerhans and Langhans, which have similar written form and whose pronounciation is also very similar. The appellative part of the two terms, cell, is shared, leading to Langerhans cell and Langhans cell. The two terms refer to different medical phenomena, but were first described in the same year, 1868, in the same journal, Wirchow Archive. Pritchard et al. mention two documented cases in which “the eponymous resemblance between the names of these two types of cell led to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment” (2003, p. 922). Similarly, Waseem et al. are concerned with how “an error in performing Finkelstein’s test has crept into the English literature, in both textbooks and journals” (2005, p. 1). This error can lead to wrong diagnosis and inappropriate treatment. They find that these problems are “due to the use of eponymous nomenclature and are not uncommonly encountered in other sections of medicine as well” (2005, p. 1). Duque-Parra et al. (2006) point out that . sometimes different authors use the same label to refer to somewhat different phenomena, and, as a result, the underlying diagnosis may be confused or misunderstood. Likewise, using a similar term to describe totally different forms of a pathology also leads to chaos. A typical example is the confusion existing between the terms “Clerambault’s syndrome” and “Kandinsky-Clerambault’s syndrome” (Duque-Parra et al., 2006, p. 220, p. 220)

Further cases of confusion are discussed in Boonstra et al. (2014), Bahs¸ i et al. (2017), Strzelec et al. (2017), Kucharz (2020) and McNulty et al. (2021).

Note that the above are all examples of confusion due to eponyms within a single language. Problems tend to be augmented in bilingual or multilingual settings. Berghammer (2006, p. 43) warns that “translators must know the subject they are addressing, not only to successfully master translation problems, but to, first of all, be aware of and identify potential pitfalls,” because “even a seemingly minor misinterpretation and mistranslation, e.g. in a package insert, can have serious practical consequences.”

In this article we demonstrate the magnitude of the problem with this type of eponymic false friends by examining the preferred and alternative terms in 8 languages (English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Russian Croatian and Hungarian) for a selection of 50 medical phenomena for which biologically descriptive terms, cognate eponyms, or alternative eponyms, simple or compound ones, exist in these languages. Our primary goals in this article are to (i) identify various types of false friends that may occur in the case of medical eponyms and (ii) explain how such relationships come into existence. Our secondary goal is to suggest how such eponymy-related problems may be mitigated.

The article is organized as follows. We first introduce in some detail the notion of false (and true) friends in Part 2. We then introduce eponymy in general, and then gradually narrow down our attention on the role of eponymy in medicine in Part 3. In part 4, we explain the methodology and the sources of data we use. Part 5, the central section of the article is the analysis of a number of cases of true friends (which is the default type of the cross-linguistic relation in our corpus), but also some flagrant cases of false friends, as well as some less obvious cases of false-friendness. An overview of strategies that can be used in teaching medical terminology based on eponymy and its translation in order to avoid pitfalls of the types discussed in 5 below are given in Part 6. In Part 7, we sum up our key findings and also suggest some strategies that can be used to alleviate the problems and minimize the potential damage.

# 2. False (and true) friends

In the process of the acquisition of a second language or learning a foreign language, we understandably try to make the best out of what we already have, maximizing the linguistic skills and the knowledge we already have, and always on the lookout for shortcuts in the learning process that could speed it up and make simpler but more efficient, be it only individual items or even whole modules observed in various areas of a language acquired previously.

It is no wonder then that learners, among other things, constantly monitor lexical items that come their way, checking them against what is already at their disposal. They are certain to identify a number of lexical friends in the course of this, i.e., pairs of words that belong to different linguistic systems but are identical or very close to each other in terms of their form (orthographic, phonological, or both). Learners may assume that formally similar words also exhibit semantically (and pragmatically) similar, if not identical, behaviour in both languages. This assumption may be in many cases justified, but sometimes it is, unfortunately, not. Sets of words belonging to different languages but exhibiting a certain degree of formal similarity are referred to in the literature as friends or cognates. They can be false or true, depending on whether there is indeed a significant degree of semantic overlap or not.

False friends (Koessler and Derocquigny, 1928, first referred to them as faux amis du tradecteur ‘false friends of a translator’), also go by the name of deceptive words, treacherous twins, etc. Needless to say, they cause problems not only for translators, but also for learners of a second or a foreign language. A number of definitions have been put forward, along with proposals for making finer distinctions based on distinguishing several subtypes. They are often defined as lexical units belonging to different languages that sound same or similar, but mean utterly different things (Chalker and Weiner, 1996; Perl and Winter, 1972, pp. 149), or as items whose spoken or written form is similar, but whose meaning is different (Gottlieb, 1972).

It is often added that they are etymologically related (Emericzy, 1980). Chamizo Domínguez (2007) distinguishes chance or coincidental false friends (illustrated above), which are pairs without a common etymological ancestor, from semantic false friends, sharing the same etymological origin.

Some examples of chance false friends are:

(1) Croatian ekser ‘nail’ (derived from Turkish) – Hungarian ékszer ‘jewellery’ (from ék ‘decoration’ $^ +$ suffix –szer) (2) Spanish chumbo ‘cactus pear’ – Portuguese chumbo ‘lead’

An example of the latter type are the English lexeme protection and its cognates in a number of languages, such as German (Protektion), Hungarian (protekció) or Croatian (protekcija). Unlike the English word, these are all used in the sense of ‘pull, favouritism, patronage’.

We are concerned in this article with the latter type, called semantic false friends by Chamizo Domínguez. We suggest that the label systematic false friends is a more appropriate designation for what Chamizo Dominguez’s calls semantic false friends because it stresses the fact that these are not just random sets, but rather regular in partly overlapping and in exhibiting some common stages in the development, and also often attaining the status of internationalisms, being part of the common lexical and conceptual stock of a number of languages.

# 3. Medical eponyms

Oxford English Dictionary (Simpson and Weiner, 1989) mentions two main uses of the term eponym: a. ‘One who gives, or is supposed to give, his name to a people, place, or institution; e.g. among the Greeks, the heroes who were looked upon as ancestors or founders of tribes or cities.’ b. transf. ‘One ‘whose name is a synonym for’ something.’ As pointed out by Garfield (1983, p. 384), it is this second usage that “seems to be gaining ascendancy.” Freeman (1997, p. vii) defines eponym as “a proper name that comes to stand for a place, or a thing, or an institution.” In the present article we narrow down the application of the term to precisely this second usage, i.e., to labels based on proper names.

The place and the function (or value) of medical eponyms has been the topic of a lively discussion for a number of years. There are voices calling for the expulsion of eponyms from terminology, as well as those in favour of keeping them as useful in several respects (see Duque-Parra et al., 2006; Jana et al., 2009; Matteson and Woywodt, 2006; Waseem et al., 2005). As Taylor (2008, p. 88) notes, the campaign against eponyms is not new, first publications appeared at the beginning of the previous century, but it seems to be on the increase today.

Concerning the types of names that can be used as eponyms and the range of what they can denote, we note that there is whole gamut of possibilities. Names that most commonly give rise to eponyms are personal names and names of inhabitants of certain areas or countries, but they can also be names of places, infrequently names of events, and possibly names of products, i.e. brandnames, if the phenomenon of eponymy is taken in its broadest sense. Eponyms can be used to denote a wide spectrum of concepts, from types of people, places, an animals or plants, various artefacts as well as an amazing set of abstract notions. In our case, the majority of medical eponyms are personal names, but they can also be geographical names, e.g. Zika virus, Marburg virus, West Nile virus, Bombay blood group, Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, etc.

Generally speaking, eponymic constructions can be nominal or verbal. Nominal eponymic constructions, the focus of this article, can be simple or complex. The latter consist of two components. One is a common or appellative noun, functioning syntactically as the head of the construction, and the other is a proper noun functioning as a modifier in the broadest sense of the term, the eponymic core.

This “modifier” can be a synthetic possessive, i.e., ’s genitive preceding the head noun (Hodgkin’s disease, Addison’s disease). The common noun is also very frequently premodified by the proper noun, as in Babinski reflex, or Eppstein-Barr virus. Many of these can be considered to be compound nouns. In some cases, this pattern is found to compete with the N’s N construction (Cushing disease/syndrome vs. Cushing’s disease/syndrome). Another possibility is to use an adjective derived from a proper noun as a modifier, as in cushingoid facies ‘moon face (moon facies)’. The proper noun may also be placed after the head in an of-construction, though this is not a very productive type: the circle of Willis, the sinuses of Aschoff and Rokitansky.

Eponymic NP constructions can also be syntactically simple in the sense that they consist of just a single noun, because the appellative part may be truncated, i.e., the common noun acting as the head is left out and only the proper noun remains. Reduced eponymic constructions like these can be considered to be the result of metonymic shifts (see Brdar-Szabó and Brdar, 2017):

(4) Bezold-Jarisch reflex, Hering-Breuer reflex, Hill-Sachs lession/fracture, Bardet-Biedl syndrom, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Sjögren-Larsson syndrome, Von Hippel-Landau disease, Carrel-Dakin treatment

Occasionally, three, or even four, names are found in such terms:

(5) Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome, Gerbec-Morgagni-Adams-Stokes syndrome

The longest eponymic term seems to consist of 5 personal names: Finsterer-Kocher-Von Haberer-Finney-Billroth procedure (Shapiro, 1958, p. 664).

Whenever we have two or more personal names joined in a single eponym, they may appear in a different order. In the majority of cases their order is fixed by convention, but it may be variable in some cases so that we have synonymous eponyms, i.e., term variants (in the sense of L’Homme, 2020, p. 66), more specifically denominative variants of discursive type (Freixa, 2006, p. 60), differing only in the order of personal names.

In this article, we demonstrate that medical eponyms can function as false friends at several levels, both in the inter-lingual and intra-lingual perspective, effectively endangering communication in medical environments. This is in part due to their metonymic forms, i.e., when they are plain eponyms, consisting of only the proper name without any descriptive term, like Alzheimer, but there are also other possibilities, as discussed in Part 5 below. This state of affairs may be considered as another piece of evidence in favour of the anti-eponymistic movement in medical terminology. However, eponyms may also function as true friends.

# 4. Methods and data

The corpus we used in the analysis in Part 5 is based on a collection of eponymic terms in 8 languages (English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Croatian, Russian, and Hungarian). In addition to English, which has attained the status of a lingua franca in medicine (MELF), and the two languages that are native languages of the authors (Croatian and Hungarian), the other five languages are among the most widely spoken ones world-wide according to the 2023 edition of Ethnologue (Spanish comes second, Russian occupies place number 7, French 16, German 19, and Italian 23). A vast number of medical publications is available in these languages, too. We randomly chose the following 50 medical phenomena for which biologically descriptive terms, cognate eponyms, or alternative eponyms, simple or compound ones, exist in one or more of these languages. Only the eponymic cores are listed:

<html><body><table><tr><td>Aarskog-Scott</td><td>Adams-Stokes</td><td>Addison</td><td>Asboe-Hansen</td></tr><tr><td>Babinski</td><td>Bright</td><td>Camurati-Engelmann</td><td>Corrigan</td></tr><tr><td>Crohn</td><td>Cruveilhier-Baumgarten</td><td>Cushing</td><td>Duncan</td></tr><tr><td>Erb-Duchene</td><td>Fabry</td><td>Gingival</td><td>Graves Klinefelter</td></tr><tr><td>Hashimoto</td><td>Havisham</td><td>Hirschsprung</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Laurence-Mood</td><td>Lightwood</td><td>Lisfranc</td><td>Marburg</td></tr><tr><td>McCune-Albright</td><td>Means-Lerman</td><td>Osler-Weber-Rendu</td><td>Paget</td></tr><tr><td>Parkinson</td><td>Pick</td><td>Pickwick</td><td>Plummer-Vinson</td></tr><tr><td>Quervain Riley-Day</td><td>Primrose</td><td>Ranke</td><td>Raynaud</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Rokitansky-Aschoff</td><td>Sjogren</td><td>Stillman</td></tr><tr><td>Tietz</td><td>Waterhouse-Friedrichsen</td><td>Watson</td><td>Wegner</td></tr><tr><td>Wilson Zuelzer-Kaplan</td><td>Wernicke-Korsakoff Zumbusch</td><td>Zahorsky</td><td>Zondek</td></tr></table></body></html>

In theory, we could expect 400 such terms in the corpus plus the 50 descriptive terms. However, in many cases there were alternative eponyms, too. For example, in the case of Graves disease, instead of just 7 equivalent eponyms we found as many as 24 examples of eponyms as well as 2 English rival terms. Some languages exhibited just one counterpart for a given eponymy, while there were 3, 4 or even 5, equivalents in some other languages. The total number of items in our database was 679.

The equivalents in various languages were all analysed against the background of English in order to make the analysis manageable, and not for all the possible pairings/matchings). We did not examine systematically whether Croatian and Hungarian, or Spanish and Italian equivalents were in a false friend type of relationship, although some of these are discussed in Part 5. In order to illustrate the multitude of possible pairings, i.e., cross-linguistic relationships, let us just state that for Graves disease and its two English variants, we established that the number of various pairings across languages is 310. On the other end of the cline, there are also eponymic terms like Klinefelter syndrome, for which there was only a single equivalent in all the other languages.

The sources we used were various medical dictionaries (listed in the References section) as well as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) of the World Health Organization (WHO),1 and Orphanet. The portal for rare diseases and rare drugs. 2 Both of these are searchable multilingual databases, the former is offered in 9 languages, the latter in 5 languages. In both of them medical phenomena are associated with (alpha)numerical codes that make possible their unique identification and distinction.

# 5. Medical eponyms as true and false friends across languages

If medical eponyms can be false friends, they can be only false friends of the near-systematic type in the sense we described above. They tend to acquire the status of internationalisms, and their eponymic cores tend to share their etymological sources. Systematic false friends are the result of fluid polysemy most of the time arising due to metaphor and, most commonly, to metonymy. We refer to this polysemy as fluid because the incremental shifts may be relatively small, with lots of semantic overlapping typical of metonymy, and because shifts in meaning do not necessarily settle and stop after a certain period of time. Members of such sets acquire over time some new meanings and shed some older ones in language L1, while in another language, L2, those meanings that are shed in L1 are still kept, and possibly new ones are acquired, most likely ones that are different from those newly acquired meanings in L1.

This sort of change and polysemy is, however, not desirable in the case of terminology – terms must be in an ideal case stable enough and not drift. Luckily, medical eponyms are fairly stable and do not give rise to the development of false friends so often and so easily. They do not easily acquire new meanings, and do not lose old ones. They may be dropped, or formally modified (adding a new part, or truncating the existing one, or changing its grammar slightly, or its spelling).

Polysemy, synonymy and homonymy are phenomena that have been duly recognized and studied as phenomena that are “at the heart of terminological variation” (Daille, 2017, p. 12). They may all cause problems in terminology, although their magnitude may vary. Polysemy in terminology may in our opinion be of two types. Exogenous polysemy originates outside a terminological set and is mostly based on metaphorical extensions (e.g. Birne in German, being used for ‘pear’ in general vocabulary, and for ‘light bulb’ in electrotechnical terminology). This is what Cabré (1999, p. 111, 230) considers terminological homonymy. The other type, endogenous, is mostly based on metonymic extensions, as for example pathology, as discussed in Brdar (2019) and Brdar-Szabó and Brdar (2021), with at least 6 related uses in medicine. Polysemy as such does not cause grave problems in terminology, but we show below that it can be the source of problems in the case of eponymy related by a special case of polysemy called auto-hyponymy, auto-troponymy (Fellbaum, 2002), or vertical polysemy (Koskela, 2005), argued to be motivated by metonymic processes where a category member stands for the whole category or vice versa (Kövecses and Radden, 1998, p. 53). Terminological synonyms, including terminological variants (e.g., when there is a variation in the appellative part of an eponymic term, such as disease vs. syndrome, or the variation in the use or non-use of the genitive ‘s), are generally undesirable (Cabré, 1999, p. 200; Bradean-Ebinger and János, 1999, p. 1589), but not extremely problematic, and this also applies to medical eponyms. However, we also show some cases of false friends based on synonymy. Homonymy is an undesirable phenomenon in terminology that needs to be eliminated (Cabré, 1999, p. 51), but terminological homonyms may arise due to the fact that terms of a field are never a completely fixed set shut from changes as the field dynamically develops. We show below that several subtypes of terminological homonyms may develop for various reasons, some of which are based on metonymic extensions.

Most of medical terms are truly global internationalisms, and are under constant surveillance. Medical terminology belongs to one of the most orderly terminological sets because it is subject to codification and very strict control. This explains why in theory eponymic false friends should not exist in medical terminology. There are, however, some factors that may facilitate confusion, and eventually lead to something like false-friendness on the fringe, usually obtaining just between two, or between a very small number of languages. Medical terminology is open for revision and innovation, reflecting revisions and innovations in medicine. These innovations and revisions are not a top-down phenomenon, implemented from above, but rather bottom–up processes (although possibly spreading fairly quickly, enforcing official sanction or canonization in due time).

The examples that follow illustrate more or less well what we have in mind when we talk about false friends in specialized language, including terminology. They are pairs or sets of expressions whose members match across languages exhibiting the maximum of formal similarity and at the same time the minimum of semantic identity (in our case this minimum is the fact that they denote some medical phenomena).

False friends apart from eponymic terms can be found in health discourse (Divasson and Léon, 2002), as in ordinary language or other types of specialized discourse (Lewis, 2020), e.g., in law (Földi, 2020), or in music (Granado and Miller, 2018). Some of the best-known examples are the noun angina in various languages and the adjective pair intoxicated (English) – intoxicado (Spanish). Angina without any addition is used in the sense of tonsilitis or angina tonsilaris in languages like Russian (Nicholls, 2003), Croatian, or Hungarian. If the cardiac condition is meant, then pectoris is always added. According to Nicholls (2003), this meaning was also present in English in the mid-16th century, two centuries later it was also used as shorthand for angina pectoris, severe chest pain caused by inadequate blood supply to the heart. Intoxicated is used to refer to someone under the influence of alcohol or drugs, while the Spanish adjective intoxicado is predicated of someone suffering from food poisoning.

In the analysis that follows we first focus on eponymic terms that function as true friends, i.e., inter-lingual synonyms, which can also be intra-lingual synonyms of other eponymic terms, and thus also forming a network of indirect true friends (5.1). In the rest of this part of the article, we consider various types of eponymic terms that function as false friends.

# 5.1. Eponymic true friends

For a single medical phenomenon there may be a single eponym, or a primary one and some additional ones, mononomial or polynomial ones, i.e., they may contain just a single or several personal names. Some of these additional eponyms may be universally available (i.e., in practically every language), but it is also quite likely that some of them may also be of limited distribution. In any case, they are all intra-lingual, but also inter-lingual synonyms.

The vast majority of medical eponyms are true friends if we assume a cross-linguistic perspective. They share both the same meaning and, more or less closely, the same form in many languages. This is not to mean that they are universally true friends, valid for all pairs of languages, at least as far as the eponymic core is concerned. Just a couple of examples will suffice here:

(6) Lisfranc fracture (English) – lesió de Lisfranc (Spanish) – entorse de Lisfrance (French) – Lisfranc-Fraktur (German) – prijelom Lisfranca/Lisfranc fraktura (Croatian) - Lisfranc törés (Hungarian)   
(7) Klinefelter syndrom (English) – Klinefelter-Syndrom (German) – síndrome de Klinefelter (Spanish) – syndrome di Klinefelter (Italian) – cиoдrpn Lmakovfm:tfra (Russian) – Klinefelter szindróma (Hungarian)

A language may exhibit alternative eponyms for the same phenomenon and they are synonyms of each other, and they are intra-lingual true friends. Another language may have the same set, or just one of the eponymic terms, or any combination of the elements. Members of the two sets that directly correspond to each other are also true friends, while a member of one set and the synonym of its direct counterpart in the other language are also indirect true friends, i.e., they relate as a friend of a friend. The label Aarskog-Scott syndrome is used in English alongside with Aarskog syndrome or Aarskog disease to refer to a type of faciogenital dysplasia. Its German counterparts exhibit the same structure, Aarskog-Scott-Syndrom and AarskogSyndrom (Fig. 1).

# 5.2. Eponymic false friends in medical vocabulary

There were not too many classic examples of absolute false friends in our corpus in the sense that the same combination of an eponymic core and an appellative is used in one language to refer to one phenomenon, while it is used in another language to refer to another, unrelated phenomenon (we have attested just Marburg and Pick’s disease). Nevertheless, the phenomenon of false friends, in one form or another, can be observed in our corpus when it comes to certain pairings of terms belonging to different languages. Out of 50 medical conditions denoted by means of eponymic terms in our corpus, more than a third, i.e., 18 $( 3 6 \% )$ partake of some type of false friend relationship (see Table 1). English terms are involved in all of these, but not their equivalents in all the seven other languages, but in some cases, there are two or more other languages involved. Of course, the number of problematic eponymic terms we have established in our corpus may be a pure coincidence, due to the random choice of the eponyms. Their number may be lower, or perhaps higher for a different sample, but we should bear in mind that our numbers in the table above refer to the number of eponymic terms, and not to the actual instances or intra- or interlingual relationships that count as pairs of false friends. Thus Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, ICD-10 I78.0, or hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, counts as one case in 5.2.4. Its synonyms include Babington’s disease, corresponding to enfermedad Babington and malattia di Babington in Spanish and Italian, respectively. Babington is not mentioned in a conventionalized eponym in German, French, Croatian, Russian or Hungarian, which can lead to 15 pairs of false friends.

A relationship of that type may come into existence due to various reasons. In the remaining part of this section, we distinguish between three main situations, to which we also add pseudo-eponymic false friends, which are the result of an illicit transfer of one of the alternative terms used in one language to another language (similar to the phenomenon of pseudo-anglicisms).

# 5.2.1. False friends arising through shortening or truncation

In the first case to be discussed, formally different eponymic terms denoting different medical phenomena in one language can be formally truncated or shortened so that their eponymic core becomes identical. They become confusables, or intralingual false friends, i.e., they function as homonyms (Fig. 2).

![](img/5a17162327b0ec7f5ac9ea7faa0f1021abee796858405d26cb44b45352549928.jpg)  
Figure 2. Truncated eponymic terms denoting different medical phenomena that are confusables or homonyms in L1, and which may lead to false friend relationships across languages.

# CONFUSABLES/EPONYMIC HOMONYMS (INTRA-LINGUAL FALSE FRIENDS)

This phenomenon comes in two basic versions that can also be combined. In one subtype, what is truncated is the appellative, originally combined with the formally identical eponymic core. In a case documented in our corpus, the eponymic core Marburg is actually a homonym. On the one hand, it is originally the name of a city in Germany in which one of the first outbreaks of a hemorrhagic fever caused by a particular virus happened in 1967. On the other hand, Otto Marburg was an Austrian neurologist who discovered a variant of multiple sclerosis in 1905. These resulted in two eponyms, Marburg virus and Marburg’s disease or Marburg variant of multiple sclerosis. The hemorrhagic fever is also called Marburg virus disease.

As it happens, names of diseases are often metonymically shortened to the germs that cause them (e.g., Zika, dengue, or coronavirus, as in the utterance following the global fallout of the coronavirus). So, the original expression Marburg virus disease can be truncated to become Marburg disease and then just Marburg. The same is true of the far less frequently used term Marburg disease, referring to a type of multiple sclerosis. Such truncations, which are results of metonymic operations, are discussed in Brdar-Szabó and Brdar (2017).

A number of eponymic names of diseases lend themselves to truncations due to the metonymy of the type PHYSICIAN FOR THE DISEASE ASSOCIATED WITH HIM/HER, but as we have seen it may also be PLACE FOR THE DISEASE ASSOCIATED WITH IT. In some cases there is also another metonymic turn in which the name of the disease stands for a patient (e.g., a well-known Asperger). Metonymy is a ubiquitous conceptual operation of expanding or reducing the conceptual content of a sign (not just verbal, but also non-verbal signs), while keeping its form (see; Brdar and Brdar-Szabó, 2022; Barcelona, 2010; Kövecses and Radden, 1998; Ruiz de Mendoza, 2011; Brdar-Szabó & Brdar, 2021). These reductions or expansions based on contiguity or association of the metonymic vehicle result in two basic forms of metonymy, PART FOR WHOLE and WHOLE FOR PART. Depending on the ontological status of the metonymic vehicle and the metonymic target, these two basic types can be realized in many more specific subtypes, e.g., PLACE FOR EVENT, MATERIAL FOR THE OBJECT CONSTITUTED OF THAT MATERIAL, PRODUCER FOR THE PRODUCT, etc. PHYSICIAN FOR THE DISEASE ASSOCIATED WITH HIM/HER can be seen as a special subtype of PRODUCER FOR THE PRODUCT.

Full-blown eponymic terms discussed in this article clearly belong to medical terminology. However, their truncated forms, like Marburg, tend to percolate towards an area intermediate between general vocabulary and terminology, forming part of a jargon used by experts and even informed laypeople. This implies a widening of the range of contexts that are conducive to confusion. Note that such uses still fall within the purview of MELF as defined by Tweedie and Johnson (2022). As we have seen above, two different metonymies are associated with the same formal vehicle, Marburg. The end result of these metonymy-based truncations is therefore homonymy, or a pair of intra-lingual false friends or confusables (Figure 3).

Figure 3. The truncation of the appellative part leading to intra-lingual homonymy.

If the same or similar processes take place in another language, we end up with two pairs of inter-lingual false friends if the appellative disease is kept, as shown in Figure 4, and with two more pairs if the appellative is truncated, as in Figure 5.

![](img/5d0232b193b03e6f286f19d855f02db72e1814a18ed285ed45118957a1ed32be.jpg)

In addition to Marburg-Krankheit for a variant of multiple sclerosis, there is also Marburg-Variante in German. MarburgKrankheit is also used to refer to hemorrhagic fever. It can also be further truncated and used without the appellative, as in (8) Marburg ist sehr ansteckend, kann aber durch den sofortigen Einsatz einer Vielzahl von Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung des Ausbruchs effektiv kontrolliert und gestoppt werden. (https://www.n-tv.de/wissen/Koennte-sich-das-Marburgvirus-weltweit) ‘Marburg is highly contagious, but it can be effectively controlled and stopped with the immediate use of a variety of measures to combat the outbreak.’

Hungarian also has one term, Marburg-kór (Marburg disease), to refer to both conditions. The same is true of Spanish enfermedad de Marburg (la fiebre hemorrágica de Marburgo ‘hemorrhagic fever of Marburg’ is used as an alternative term for A98.3). This means that we have two pairs of English-German false friends, two pairs of English-Spanish false friends, as well as two pairs of English-Hungarian false friends. Additionally, more pairs of false friends are established when German, Spanish and Hungarian are compared. There are no homonyms or intra-lingual false friends in languages that turn Marburg into adjectives, as happens in Slavic languages. In Croatian, we thus find marbur-ska bolest/groznica (Marburg-ADJ.REL disease/ fever) contrasting with Marburgova bolest (Marburg-POSS.ADJ disease’). Similarly, in Russian Narbur[sla> bpmfio: is used for fever, while bpmfio: Narbur[a (with the genitive inflection on the noun) is used for the type of multiple sclerosis. Note that no false friend relations obtain between Croatian and Russian in these cases, but that choosing the right Croatian or Russian equivalents for the homonymic English, German, Spanish or Hungarian terms may cause some problems.

As shown in Brdar-Szabó and Brdar (2017), this truncation may be restricted in certain languages. While Billroth I/II operation or Fontan(-Kreutzer) procedure/operation are often truncated to Billroth I/II and Fontan, respectively, in English, this is not the always the case in German, Croatian and Hungarian. This again widens the range of possibilities for confusion. It is also interesting that the truncation Fontan is used in German in a sense that is different from ‘Fontan operation procedure.’ It is used to refer to the so-called Fontan circulation of Fontan circuit. This may be seen as a double metonymy, whose additional leg refers to the outcome of the operation, or as an independent metonymic truncation, as the full-blown terms also exist (in English, too). In any case, this seems to be a special case of the first subtype.

Figure 5. The truncation of the appellative part leading to two pairs of false friends.

We now turn to the second subtype in which the eponymic core is shortened or truncated. We have seen in 3 and 5.1 above that the number of personal names within a single eponym varies between two and five names, the majority consisting of two or three names. For reasons of simplicity, this is often reduced to just one or two names, as shown by the following examples. As discussed above, the label Aarskog-Scott syndrome is used in English alongside with Aarskog syndrome or Aarskog disease to refer to a type of faciogenital dysplasia. There is no hard-and-fast rule for the method of truncation. First of all, a complex eponym may develop a truncated version or versions but may also be kept in its full form (always or most of the time). Generally, the names that occur towards the end of the complex eponym are most likely to become truncated, but this is not necessarily always the case (in other words, truncation starts from the right-hand end and proceeds to the left). Note that the order of the names in complex eponyms may be motivated by a series of factors (e.g., the magnitude of the contribution, temporal order of discovery/publication, prestige, seniority, etc.), but may also be result of coincidence, i.e. the draw of the luck, as in the case of James Watson winning the coin flip with Francis click, leading to the Watson-Crick model of DNA.

Cruveilhier-Baumgarten disease or syndrome (K74.6), also known as Pégot-Cruveilhier-Baumgarten disease or syndrome, has binomial counterparts in all the other languages in the sample, while German, Spanish and French also have trinomial versions. German also has a mononomial version, Cruveilhier-Krankheit There is, however, also amytrophic lateral sclerosis called Cruveilhier’s disease, also known in English as Lou Gehrig disease or Charcot disease (G12.1). The same expression, Cruveilhier’s disease, is also used to refer to the peptic ulcer. German also exhibits a single name eponym, Cruveilhier-Krankheit. The assumption that the form with just Cruveilhier is a truncated version of the eponymic terms with two or three names for K74.6 is mistaken. If we consider Spanish terminology, we see that enfermedad de Cruveilhier (‘disease of Cruveilhier’) can also be used to refer to ureteritis cystica or pyeloureteritis cistica (N28.85), also referred to in Spanish literature as enfermedad de Morgagni, but also to an ulcer, as in English. Let us just add that Morgagni szindróma is used in Hungarian as a truncated variant of Morgagni-Adams-Stokes szindróma (‘Morgagni-Adams-Stokes syndrome’).

Another similar situation obtains in the case of postcricoid dysphagia, upper esophageal webs, and iron deficiency anemia (D50.1), which is called Plummer-Vinson syndrome, Vinson-Plummer syndrome, as well as Patterson–Kelly disease or Patterson– Kelly Brown disease. Plummer disease is not a truncation of the first two but is used to denote toxic multi-nodular goiter (E05.21). Similarly, Patterson syndrome or Patterson’s disease are not truncations but labels for pseudoleprechaunism (E34.8). The latter also have structural equivalents in other languages: German Patterson-Syndrom; Spanish: síndrome de Patterson; Croatian: Pattersonov sindrom.

A confusion may ensue from the fact that one and the same family name in the eponymic core refers to different people associated with different phenomena. Pick’s disease (ICD-10 code G31.01) is a kind of dementia similar to Alzheimer’s but far less common. It is also known as frontotemporal dementia or frontotemporal lobar degeneration. The person behind this eponym is Arnold Pick, a psychiatrist of German-Jewish origin, born and died in Czechia. Friedel Pick was an Austrian-Czech physician whose name has become attached to chronic constrictive pericarditis, yielding another Pick’s disease. The confusion is made possible by the routine truncation of full names to just family names, which is described in Brdar-Szabó and Brdar (2023) as a case of metonymy family name for a specific member of the family, as subtype of generic for specific.

This sort of shortening we have seen above may in its own right account for many cases of confusion, but the situation is made worse by the fact that one and the same family name may occur in two or more such polynomial eponyms, standing for the same or different people. The latter is illustrated by three medical eponyms related to Fuller Albright. One is LightwoodButler-Albright syndrome, also referred to as Lightwood-Albright syndrome or as Butler-Albright syndrome in English (this is a distal renal tubular acidosis, N25.98). The second is McCune-Albright syndrome, also known in English as just Albright syndrome or Albright(‘s) disease (a type of fibrous dysplasia). Finally, there is Albright’s hereditary osteodystrophy, which is associated with hypoparathyroidism. This condition is sometimes also referred to as Albright’s disease in English. It is clear that two different conditions may be called the same, using a pair of eponymic terms (Albright syndrome and Albright disease), while the Albright(‘s) disease, can be the truncation of McCune-Albright syndrome, but not of Lightwood-Butler-Albright syndrome/Lightwood-Albright/Butler-Albright syndrome. This all of course often leads to confusion and misunderstandings (Fig. 6).

![](img/2c6ac6569f8b21de4efd0a557e98804131096282169792d01581a2c19ef84d4d.jpg)  
Figure 6. Intra-lingual confusables arising through the truncation of the polynominal eponymic core.

The Hungarian counterpart of this term, Albright-kór (‘Albright disease’) is again used in the same way as in English to refer to these two different conditions.3 To make things even more complicated, let us just add that Albright himself coined the eponym Seabright-Bantam syndrome to refer to just hypoparathyroidism (which is often referred to in the literature as Albright’s Seabright-Bantam syndrome).

This means that we have three pairs of true friends, but paradoxically also two pairs of false friends (Fig. 7).

![](img/cab40d13861ccfafd6a6078ae72607fcc0ddb56625c5cfdfc521b63a134bfe36.jpg)  
Figure 7. Eponymic terms functioning as true and false friends, involving the truncation of a polynomial eponymic core, where the same family name stands for different people.

From what we have seen, it is more than obvious that the truncation of a sequence of two or three family names to just one may lead to a lot of confusion within MELF, but even more so in the cross-linguistic perspective.

5.2.2. False friends due to confusables being reinterpreted as synonyms in one language, but not in another

Another case where we come close to the prototypical false–friend relationship in addition to the above is an eponymic term confused with another and used to refer to two similar phenomena in the same language. This happens when the term Corrigan pulse is used in English not in its primary sense of ‘forceful and then collapsing pulse caused by a leaky aorta’, but to refer to the so-called waterhammer pulse, which is also called Watson’s pulse. This confusion may then spread to other languages. Thus, we find that in German the terms Corrigan-Puls and Wassehammerpuls are often considered to be synonymous expressions. A similar pair in Spanish is pulso de Corrigan and pulso de martillo en agua. This may already produce a falsefriend-like network across several languages but may get worse when the eponym Corrigan’s pulse is incorrectly used, and is then paired with its counterpart in a language lacking the above pseudo-synonymy.

5.2.3. False friends arising due to hyperonym “lowering” or tautonymization

A variation on this theme is when one eponymic term is a hyponym of another eponymic term, or they are co-hyponyms of a common hyperonym (Stage 1), but they get confused over time, and all the three get to be considered to be synonyms (Stage 2), as shown in the examples that follow.

In addition to generalised pustular psoriasis called Zumbusch disease (or Zumbusch syndrome), there are also localised types of pustular psoriasis, one of which is acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau (also called Hallopeau disease), while a type of lichenoid dermatitis is referred to as Csillag’s disease (Fig. 8).

![](img/8c006d67f16b1031f9bfe545cc584770994a0c1de70bbb0b0bb1897dd96213de.jpg)  
Figure 8. Hyperonymy obtaining in Stage 1 between Zumbusch syndrome, Hallopeau disease and Csillag’s disease.

These are often wrongly believed, even by trained physicians, to refer to the same phenomenon, i.e., they are treated as synonyms. The hyperonym is in an intermediary stage treated as its own hyponym, i.e., as case of the so-called vertical polysemy, made possible by the metonymy GENERIC IS SPECIFIC. In the following stage the hyperonymy relationship disappears and the members of the set are treated as synonyms (Fig. 9).

This may lead to ample confusion, in intra- and interlingual situations. In an encounter between health practitioners with a linguistic background, and a type of training, in which Stage 1 is not followed by Stage 2, and health practitioners from a linguistic or professional background in which Stage 2 obtains, false friends may obstruct their mutual communication (Fig. 10).

# 5.2.4. Pseudo-eponymy

In the introduction we briefly discussed Graves’ disease and its counterparts in various languages (totalling 24 counterparts in 8 languages, in addition to 3 terms in English). All the 8 languages mention Graves in one way or another, but the combination Graves-kór, lit. ‘Graves-syndrome,’ and Graves-betegség, lit. ‘Graves-disease,’ are attested in Hungarian, but they are fairly rare – they are outnumbered by Basedow-kór, lit. ‘Basedow-syndrome,’ and by combinations of Basedow and Graves in either order. As a consequence of this, we may expect that a user with Hungarian-language background is likely to underuse the term Graves’ disease while communicating in English, and also being slightly puzzled/confused on hearing or reading that expression because the condition in question is regularly referred to by a different name. Flaijani or Flaiani only seems to be mentioned in Italian counterparts. It is not problematic when it is combined with Basedow and Graves (malattia FlaianiBasedow-Graves), but it can also be used alone, malattia di Flaiani or morbo Flajani. Turning these two into English, i.e., rendering them as Flajani/Flaiani disease, may remain enigmatic, even for endocrinologists, and would produce a false–friend relationship, when used in the belief that it is also a member of the English set of synonymous expressions, just like in Italian. Similar is the Italian term malattia di Mya, as an alternative for malattia di Hirschsprung (Hirschsprung disease) (Fig. 11).

# 6. Exposing eponymic false friends and strategies for avoiding their pitfalls: from opps to wow and aha and to mhm

The problem that eponymic false friends pose could be eliminated if medical eponyms were replaced by descriptive terms, as argued for by Duque-Parra et al. (2006), Jana et al. (2009) or Matteson and Woywodt (2006). There is, of course, the possibility of a compromise, what Capuzzo calls hybrid eponyms, “eponyms incorporating proper nouns next to the description of the disease or disorder” (2008, p. 28), such as Siemens-Bloch pigmented dermatosis or Axenfeld’s posterior embryotoxon-juvenile glaucoma. However, Hunter et al. believe that “when there is an accurate understanding of their meaning, eponyms are valuable shorthand, since they convey a good deal of specific information in an abbreviated way” (2000, p. 820). And it is precisely their short-hand nature, or relative brevity, that keeps medical eponyms alive, and makes them the preferred choice in various types of medical communication. But this comes at a pricedoccasional confusables and false friends.

So, if medical eponyms are kept and occasionally cause problems, some prophylactic measures must be implemented, the most obvious and reasonable ones being appropriate pedagogical interventions in the course of the training of medical practitioners. These interventions may occur “on-the-go,” as medical students progress from course to course, experienced members of teaching staff who are familiar with particular pitfalls due to confusables and false friends may point out potential problems. If the language of instruction is other than English, teaching staff with international experience, and speaking English and/or other foreign languages may be in quite a good position to warn their students. If medical studies are offered in English in a country in which English is not spoken as the first or official language, teachers with a different native language background may be even more sensitive to the problem, or perhaps not, being simply guided by the terminology used in their native language and leading their students into pitfalls, i.e., contributing towards the replication of terminological errors. Another pedagogical opportunity are MELF courses or more general ESP courses outside English-speaking countries (in some countries foreign language courses are obligatory at the university level for at least part of the training).

The task of explaining and teaching eponymic false friends, and false friends in general, is not a simple one. The expression “teaching false friends” may at first sight appear to be a confusing one. What we mean here is, of course, not teaching someone how to produce or use false friends, but rather how to avoid falling into false friend traps, i.e., warning language users of dangers, and also guiding them towards using the correct expression in a given language.

The procedure we have in mind consists of three stages, an affective (oops), a cognitive (wow/aha), and a conative one (mhm). The second could be skipped, but we believe that the procedure is far more efficient if it is not skipped. What is more, we can loop from the second stage back to the initial, and then returning to the second and the third one.

It is a wide-spread opinion that negative evidence is not essential in language acquisition and language learning. However, we believe that it might be useful if it is coupled with strong emotional response. This emotional response helps override the insensitivity threshold associated with the false impression about the relationship between two or more expressions, leading to the durable strengthening of the appropriate idea about the relationship between these expressions. Pavlenko (2013) talks about affective turn in SLA. According to Kanazawa, “emotion can energize cognition and facilitate learning, retention, memory, and acquisition when harnessed well” (2021, p. 2). The focus of research has been on the attitude towards a foreign language, the emotions associated with it, the acquisition of emotions words, and words with positive or negative valence. However, what has not been in the focus of research, to the best of our knowledge, is the emotional reaction to the acquisition of normal, average words under normal conditions, but also when accompanied by negative evidence. What we traditionally encounter in language teaching situations involving false friends is awareness raising by means of “frightening” and facethreatening, i.e., “shocking” students by demonstrating the grave consequences of their errors (this is the oops part). We believe that this may be an efficient approach to the degree that the cognitive experience is strengthened by an emotional experience.

However, we would like to suggest that we need not stop here, but may proceed to show that false friends can exhibit systematic nature, and are therefore not only something that we encounter on an idiosyncratic basis, i.e., singular phenomena unrelated to anything else. If we succeed in pointing out that the meanings involved are not totally unrelated, but are actually due to semantic extensions (mostly of the metonymic nature in our case, cf. Chamizo Domínguez and Nerlich, 2002; ChamizoDomínguez and Hatzopulu, 2018; Broz, 2008) that may also be observed elsewhere, and are therefore underlyingly related, we may complement and enhance the above mentioned cognitive and emotional experience. We may, so to say, bring it to a higher level by engaging in a brief explanation of the historical and cultural background, in our case providing the history of the eponym(s) involved. This strategy at the same time provides an angle on the phenomenon that without doubt makes teaching situations more interesting because it integrates and deepens various areas of knowledge students may already possess (apart from linguistic knowledge), and therefore exhibits a high degree of motivational power. In other words, the wow and aha parts may loop back to the emotional stage. Discussing ophthalmological eponyms, Yale et al. suggest

. a learning model that involves teaching historical aspects of the person(s) who described the sign, the signs as originally described, and its application, if available, in medical practice. Teaching history imparts purpose to the eponym and, in some cases, a more in-depth understanding of the process or steps involved in identifying the particular finding. Teaching the finding as described by the author avoids misattribution or communication errors. Lastly, the application of the finding in clinical practice should be covered, incorporating known and evolving techniques and technologies to understand the disease or disease process better (Yale et al., 2021, p. 13, p. 13).

Strong emotional experience that attaches to such historical and cultural mappings also has a memory strengthening effect, helping students to retain key pieces of linguistic information longer, making sure that appropriate alarms will be activated where and when necessary. We see metonymy as one of the backbones of these mini-stories or -narratives. These stories should be told in a convincing and logical fashion, corresponding to historical facts as closely as possible.

As for the conative stage (mhm), we refer to Yale et al. as one possibility:

The teacher should explain and, in some cases, demonstrate the proper performance of the eponym and its application in clinical practice. The eponym should be practiced with feedback provided, and in the case of eponyms involving signs, their utility in assisting in diagnosis be emphasized . (Yale et al., 2021. p. 13)

# 7. Conclusions

We have shown in this article that while medical eponyms are in the majority of cases internationalisms and therefore true friends they can also be interlingual false friends, effectively endangering communication in medical environments. A number of types of such false friends were identified. We also attempted to uncover their etiology.

We have established that eponymic false friends in medical terminology may arise through clipping or truncation of the appellative or of a complex eponymic core (e.g., from two or three names to single one) and the subsequent confusion across languages. Another type of false friends is due to the variation that can be observed with eponyms used to denote one and the same medical phenomenon. False friends may come into existence through the confusion caused by auto-hyponymy. Finally, in addition to the choice between eponymic cores of variable complexity, there may also be alternative single name cores in one or more languages that form a set of synonyms. Translation of the latter type of term may result in unwarranted introduction of a term not conventionalized in the target language due to the belief that the alternative terms are synonymous not only in the source language. This means that terminological variation, synonymy and homonymydthe notorious undesirables in terminologydare the hotbed of the majority of problems that may be described as false–friend relationship.

We also suggested some pedagogical strategies that may help mitigate the problem of false friends in MELF contexts. These are based on recent insights from SLA and cognitively oriented research on the phenomenon of false friends, i.e., they integrate affective, cognitive and conative aspects of learning.

In view of the lively discussion concerning the function (or value) of medical eponyms, the state of affairs described above may be considered as another piece of evidence in favour of the antieponymistic movement in medical terminology. However, eponyms may also function as true friends, in addition to having motivational value.
