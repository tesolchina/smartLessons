Teachers' beliefs

In second language (L2) writing, the concept of genre has been an important construct. To date, multiple theories (sometimes referred to as schools or approaches) have driven a considerable amount of genre-based research and pedagogy, including: English for Specific Purposes (ESP), Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL), and the New Rhetoric/Rhetorical Genre Studies (RGS) approach. Despite their growing prevalence, studies are needed that investigate the extent to which writing instructors adopt these theories in practice. This study addresses this issue by exploring 1) the genre-based theories that inform writing instructors' pedagogies; 2) the different genres instructors teach in their classrooms; and 3) the types of pedagogical activities practitioners employ. To understand these phenomena, survey data $( N = 1 4 1 $ ) and semi-structured interviews $( n = 7 )$ were collected from L2 English writing instructors. Findings show that ESP was the most well-known and adopted approach, followed by SFL and RGS. For written genres, most instructors reported teaching traditional, monomodal genres (e.g., argumentative essays), while digital multimodal genres were rare. This study discusses the implications of these findings, including developing teacher training, expanding pedagogies to include multimodal genres, and forging links between genres used in the classroom and those students will encounter in their lives.

# 1. Introduction

Across applied linguistics TEsOL, and second language (L2) writing, genre has been a critical and influential construct in the development of theory, reearch, and practice. Within 2 writig, in partcular, genre has received considerable attention, as scholars have advocated for diffrent theories to guide genre-based pedagogies (with the term theories oftentimes referred to as schools pproaches, or traditions; se Hyon, 1996; Johns, 2008). These include English for Specific Purposes (Swales, 1990, 2004), Systemic Functional Linguistic Halliday, 1978), and the New Rhetoric/Rhetorical Genre Studies approach (Miller, 1984; Rusell, 1997) Notably, each theory or approach - two terms we use synonymously throughout this article - foregrounds particular dimensions of genre activity and practice, diverging in subtle ways. Importantly, proponents of these approaches share common ground in ncouraging the use of geres in the clssroom, albeit to varying deree. Despite the growing prominence of these approaches over the years, it is important to note that no studies (to our knowledge) have attempted to understand the extent to which L2 writing instructors actually report adopting these theories in practice or how they are refected in the genres that instructors teach in their classroms. Since genre-based pedagogie have become an integral part of many master's and doctoral teacher-training programs and are unquestionably relevant in the domain of English for Academic Purposes (e.g., Li et al., 2020; Schwarz & Hamman-Ortiz, 2020), surveying current teachers' beliefs and practices is important In this vein, recent scholarship has also reinforced the importance of understanding instructors' practices, including aspects of their identities, awareness, theoretical/conceptual knowledge, and decision-making in L2 pedagogy more broadly (e.g., Norton & De Costa, 2017; Worden, 2019).

The current study addresses this ssue by exploring the connections between genre-based theory and practice, as reported by L2 writing instructors. In particular, this study investigates 1) the genre-based theories that L2 English writing instructors report as informing their pedagogies; 2) the different written genres that such instructors teach in their classrooms; and 3) the types of pedagogical activities that practitioners employ when teaching. In this piece, we focus specifically on L2 English writing teachers across multiple intructional contexts, with teachers completing a survey to self-report their pedagogical knowledge and practices. Several teachers also engaged in follow-up semi-structured interviews to provide context to their responses.

# 2. Literature review

# 2.1. Genre-based theories for writing research and pedagogy

During recent decades, the concept of genre has been influential in a number of fields, and especially within 2 writing. In the mid1990s, Hyon (1996) noted the wave of scholarly activity surrounding genre, specifically regarding three genre theories. Both researchers and practitioners alike felt the impact, and the movement has largely continued to present day (e.g., Philippakos & MacArthuer, 2020; Tardy, 2019a). The three approaches prompting this movement are English for Specific Purposes (ESP), Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL), and New Rhetoric/Rhetorical Genre Studies (RGS).

Notably, there are clear differences among ESP, SFL, and RGS, which primarily pertain to how genres themselves are conceptu. alized, and also the extent to which emphasis is placed on examining the text itself and/or the practices of the communities who produce them. though we do not delv int such differences at-lenth in this article insted, e Hyon, 1996; esser & Polio, 2024), it is important to note that ll three approaches do promote pedagogies surrounding the use of written genre in the classrom to arying ds. In ESP, for example, as many redrs of this joual wl be aware, the cocet f ge analysisis cenal, which rfers to the deconstruction of rhetorical and lexico-grammatical features of target texts in relation to their rhetorical context and purpose (see Casal & Kesser, 2024; Paltridge, 2014). Pedagogicall speaking, the goal is often to help learners become aware of the salient rhetoricl moves (wales, 1990) that expert writers use, as well s the rcurrent inguistic featres of the target nre(s). When it comes to SFL (Halliday, 1978), however, when teaching written genres, instruction may be highly scaffolded and implemented using the Teaching and Learing Cycle (TLC, se Accurso & Walsh Marr, 2024). This cycle typical consists of three stages: teachers modeling and deconstructing a target text; teachers and their learners engaging in joint construction of the genre; and learners independently constructing the genre (e.g., Caplan & Farling, 2016). Finall, with RGs (Millr, 1984), writing instructors often emphasize the rhetorical situation that a text responds to. This may involve in-depth explorations in which both the teacher and students investigate how the context shapes diffrent features of writing (e.g, Coe, 1994; Devitt, 2004). We note here that although there are some differences in terms of how genres are conceptualized, in practice, some teachers may blend the different theories pedagogies (e.g., adopting the TLC to teach a genre's rhetorical moves).

Because of the important roles that genres play in daily communication, the use of genre-based pedagogy has been advocated for by numerous scholars and teacher-educators (e.g., Hyland, 2022; Tardy, 2019a). As Hyland (2023) has noted, this is because genres are both pedagogically and socill eneficial fr the purposes of drawing on and responding to recurring communicative stuations. Thus, by adopting genre-based pedagogy in one's L2 writing classroom, instructors are thereby teaching their students the language and rhetorical forms needed for responding to situations they wil encounter in their everyday lie. Of course, genre pedagogy itself does have limitations and is not a panacea (a topic we return to in the next section). Sill there is a sizable body of evidence which demonstrates that genre-based approaches to L2 writing intruction can be effective. For example, numerous studies have shown that when implemented, genre-based approaches have the capacity to positively impact multipleaspects of learning, including (but not limited to): students linguistic rpertoires (.g., Harman, 2013), metacognitive genre awarenes (e.g., Negrett & McGrath, 2018), self-regulation and self-efficacy (e.g., Han & Hier, 2018), and literacy develoment both generally and within disciplines (.g., llen & Go0dspeed, 2018; Forey, 2020).

Clearly, the prevalence of genres in daily communication is unquestionable, and there is strong evidence of its utility as a peda gogical approach. As such, over the years, various instructional guidebooks have emerged advocating for their use in L2 writing classroms, and as a result, genre-based instruction has since become an integral component of many master's and doctoral teachertraining programs (e.g, Li et al., 2020; Schwarz & Hamman-Ortiz, 2020). However, despite the increased emphasis on these genre-based theories, to date, no studies (to our knowledge) have broadly attempted to understand the extent to which they influence L2 writing instructors reported practices in the classoom, or how instructors perceive the value of genre-based theories for pedagogical decision-making.

# 2.2. Written genres and activities for teaching L2 writing

In tandem with the genre movement, there has been a corresponding emphasis placed on teaching L2 writers those genres that they are likely to encounter as a part of their everyday lives. As such, numerous studies have taken varied approaches to documenting the different academic and professional genres that writing instructors have taught in their localized context, including examining how students have engaged with such genres (e.g., Casal, 2020; Darvin, 2023; Negrett & McGrath, 2018; Nesi & Gardner, 2012; Wang, 2017; Yasuda, 2011). As noted, when it comes to intruction (regardes of the genre-based theory motivating it, the primary aim has been to help students understand dfferent facts of the neothat they are better equippd or sces when facing similar rhrical situations in the future.

Despite the push to adopt genre-based pedagogies by many teacher educators, genre pedagogy does have limitations. For instance, as Tardy (2017) has noted, intructors face a number of chllenges when it comes to teaching genres in their classroms. In particular, teachers i differet instructional contexts face distinct challenges in terms of what i valued locally and intittionally (Hinkel, 2015). For instance, in primary and secondary school context, teachers regularly must abide by prescribed curricular standards in addition to meting established benchmarks. In many cases, tis results in teachers adopting what Lam (2015) has clled atest-driven curriculum, whereby teachers focus amost exclusively on preparing students to scceed on standardized tests, which may not target the genres that students will encounter in their academic and professional careers. In such cases teachers are likely to find themselves preparing students to answer explicit, sentence-level questions about grammar, in addition to preparing learners to compose more traditional test-oriented genres, such as five-paragraph essays. Although such activities are undoubtedly critical for student success on many standardized tests, researchers and practitioners alike have questioned the utility of teaching such forms and to what extent they are true 'genres' that communicate meaningful information (see Caplan & Johns, 2019; Tardy, 2019b).

Apart from a growing number of calls to embrace meaningful genres in L2 writing instruction, there have also been call for practitioners t attend to the increasingly digital, multimodal nature of written genres and communication more broadly, which do not neessaily rely onthe same kills a tradtional texts to produce and consume g., Bikowski  Casal, 2018). ighlighting this shft to multimodal genres is Lim and Polio (2020), who analyzed 161 undergraduate course sylabi acros different academic disciplines e., business, education, engineering). Of those syllabi, the authors identified 104 multimodal writing tasks that required L1/L2 English speakers to leverage both lingustic and non-linguistic modes (eg,visual, aural), many of which also required students to use digital technologies when composing. Notably, 74 of the identified writing tass were labeled as disciplinary expressons (p. 4), in which the intended audience held expectations based on established genre conventions e.g., descriptions for art exhibitions, lab reports, maps, posters, professional webpages, and research papers). Thus, Lim and Polio's study illstrates the evolving nature of written genres across pedagogical contexts, and consequently, which genres may be important for writing teachers to target in academic contexts.

A final consideration involving the teaching of writen genres pertains to how instructors approach these genres in their classrooms. Since the L2 writing field's inception in the early 190, a considerable body of research has focused on examining the affordances and effectiveness of dfferent witing activities. In this articl, we ref to the tm activity as a type of pedggl interention, executed either inside or outside of a classroom, which is intended for the purposes of eiciting language. An activity rersto how the genre or task is taught or engaged in by students, as it may be purely pedagogical in nature rather than intended to simulate a real-world task (see Els, 2017). For example, in terms of L2 writing activities, researchers have investigated the effects of and/or students' in. teractions with activities such as dictoglos (g., Prince, 2013), er review (e.g., Liu & Sader, 2003), and pre-writing activities such as mind maps (e.g., Abrams & Byrd, 2016). More recently, there has also been a swellof interest in investigating a variety of corpus-based activities (e.g., Crosthwaite, 2024; Dong & Lu, 2020) and collaborative writing activitie see Kessler, 2023; Li & Zhang, 2023). Such studies have often ben conducted in isolated classroom context, where reearchers are interestd in understanding the effets f ativities on indvil laoms. Howver, when t comes tthe mplemnttionof ge-ba pdggie, ite is known about what genres are being taught by L2 writing instructors, along with how instructors are approaching those genres via the use of various activitie (e., collaborative writing, corus-based activitie, text modeling). Thus, rearch is needed that ttempts to take a snapshot of current instructional practices. Such research has the capacity to help improve our understanding of the state of practice, and to better understand what/how many students are currently learning.

# 2.3. The current study

In response to the aforementioned gaps in the iterature, this study investigates aspects of genre-based theory, written geres, and the pedagogical activities that are employed by L2 writing teachers through the following research questions (RQs):

RQ1: What genre-based theories inform L2 writing instructors' pedagogies (and why)? RQ2: What written genres do L2 writing instructors teach in their classrooms (and why)? RQ3: When teaching genres, what types of pedagogical activities do instructors use?

# 3. Methods

# 3.1. Instruments and data

To address the RQs, two types of data were collected: a survey and semi-structured interviews.

Survey. The survey instrument was designed by the researchers using Qualtrics (Qualrics, Provo, UT). The survey was disseminated via multiple means, including being sent to intensive and academic English programs throughout the United States whose contact information was found via public web searches. It was also sent to large, applied linguistics and second language studies doctoral programs around the world. In an attempt to reach an even greater international audience, the survey call was posted to the message boards of 10 TEs0L International Association Interest section groups in areas such as applied inguisics bilingual education, computer-assted language learning, and L2 writing. In terms of sampling, the intention was to reach as broad of an audience as possible to gain a snapshot of the current practices of L2 English writing instructors, rather than to focus on a particular geographic region. The survey callitsef was relatively general and did not reveal the purpose of the study wasto investigate L2 writing teachers familiarit with and use of genre-based theories. Instead, both the call and consent form stated that the purpose was to understand the current teaching practices of intructors who teach (or have recently taught) writing to second language learners ..This includes understanding how teachers approach writing instruction, along with the materials they use (excerpt from recruitment posting/consent form).

The 26-question survey took participants approximately 15 minutes to complete and consisted of three main sections (see the Appendix for the full survey). After reading a university-approved Institutional Review Board consent form, survey section one asked teachers series of biographical questions about their personal/professional histories (eg., age, gender, education, years of teaching experience, teaching locations/contexts, and the courses and learner populations they had taught.

In section two, participants answered open-ended and multiple-choice items to self-report their knowledge of genre theories and instructional practices. Throughout section two, participants were asked to focus on the three most recent L2 writing courses they had taught during the past five years. This decision was made to help narrow the focus of participants responses to their recent pedagogical practices and to reduce the amount of time it took teachers to complete the survey. Multiple questions inquired about teachers knowledge and conscous use of the three main genre-based theories, including: what genre-based aproaches/theories/schools they could \*briefly decribe to a co-worker if asked to do so (if any); how they had leaned about the specific enre-based approach (e.g., in their master's program, doctoral program, a conference, elsewhere); and, if any of the genre-based approaches informed their teaching. Section two also asked about other aspects of teachers' pedagogies and use of different genres and activities. For instance, questions inquired about the types of written genres participants taught in their courses (if any); the types of activities used in their classes (with 13 options provided in addition to ther writ-in options); the types of activitie teachers would like to try but had been unable to; and the challenges L2 writing teachers faced in their contexts. I is important to reiterate that these questions aked educators toself-report on their knowledge and practices, and no assessments of knowledge or pedagogical observations were carried out As such, these findings are treated as insights into L2 English writing instructors' personal asessments and rationales for decision. making.

The final section of the survey asked teachers if they would be willing to participate in a semistructured interview to furthe. explain their responses. Participants could select yes or no, and if selecting yes, they were asked to provide an email addres.

Semi-structured interviews. Those who were wiling to participate in a semi-structured interview were contacted within one week of completing the survey. The goal of the interview was to better understand aspects of teachers' responses. As such, the re. searchers independently engaged in one-on-one interviews with teachers. Teachers were asked probing questions about their survey responses, including to provide more information about: the writing course(s) they reported teaching (e.g., student population, class size, students' needs); the genre-based theory/theories they reported as informing their teaching (and why/how it inluenced their actions); why they taught those genres they reported; and why they adopted some activities but were unable to use others. All interviews took placed using synchronous video communication tool. Each interview was audio recorded and lasted approximately 30-45 minutes.

# 3.2. Participants

For the survey, 202 participants initially recorded responses. However, upon screening the data, 61 participants' responses were incomplete (e.g., only a few questions answered) and thus removed, resulting in 141 responses for the final analyses.

The 141 instructors reported an average age of 46.2 years $\mathrm { \Delta } S D = 1 1 . 7$ , range 27-73 years) and predominantly identified as female (109 female, 30 male, 2 did not share). Most had obtained a master's degree as their highest form of education (7 BA, 97 MA, 37PhD) with an average of 14.2 years of L2 writing teaching experience ( $\mathbf { \boldsymbol { S } } \mathbf { \boldsymbol { D } } = 9 . 2$ , range 1-42 years). Participants were largely US-educated, with 103 receiving their highest degree from a US institution, but 27 addtional nations were rpresented among that educational data at least once. The highest earned degrees were largely assciated with TESOL, applied inguisics, English, second language studies/ teaching, or education. While the US was once again the most represented nation in which participants had taught L2 writing during the past five years $\left( N = 8 5 \right.$ $6 0 . 3 \%$ of the sample), participants also represented L2 writing instructional contexts in China (8), Japan (8), France (6), Turkey (5), and Vietnam (4) There were also two (2) instructors each located in Ecuador, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Peru, Rusia, Thailand, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar, and one instructor each in Albania

We note that ths broad dataset is marked with a strong representation from educators with tiesto the Us, but we also note that many educators have experience within the last five years teaching across multiple countries. Nevertheless,the breadth of the sample does mean that our findings may not be locally representative of the various contexts included in the sample. As mentioned, participating instructors were asked about their most recently taught L2 writing courses, and courses varied considerably. Courses ranged from graduate to secondary education (predominantly undergraduate university-level courses), intermediate-to-advanced level proficiency, and general, discipline, and genre-specific foci.

For the semi-structured interviews, 20 teachers were contacted, with seven ultimately responding and completing an interview. These instructors, shown in Table 1, were all female and had an average of 18.7 years of L2 writing teaching experience $\langle S D = 7 . 7$ range 6-30 years). Their current/recent teaching locations included the US (5), Turkey (1), Lithuania (1), and Bolivia (1). Two in structors had PhDs (one in English language teaching from a Turkish university; one in L2 writing from a US university), while the Others had earned master's degrees (TEsOL, TESL, and two in applied linguistics, allfrom US universities).

# 3.3. Data analyses

Two types of data were examined in this study, including 141 survey responses and seven semi-structured interviews. Survey question responses were aregated, with some thematically analyzed to organize instructors responses. For example, as part of RQ2 (regarding the range of genre taught i 2 writing courses), instructors were asked to ist the target genres in each of the three most recent L2 writing courses they had taught. Therefore, some responses were collapsed when differences were minimal (e.g., comparecontrast vs.comparison and contras essy) or when the genre could be interpreted as a similar practice (e.., secondary reearch paper vs. source-based research paper). When highlighting trends in instructors' survey responses, decriptive satisics (i., M percentages) are used when appropriate.

Numerical pattrns in the survey data guided the subsequent semi-structured interviews and their analysis. The audio interviews were transcribed using verbatim transcription for qualitative thematic analysis (see Polio & Friedman, 2017). In the findings section we present excerpts from these semi-structured interviews in a supporting role to the survey data as a means of interrogating and accounting for the observed patterns.

# 4. Findings

For each of the three RQs, we first provide a numerical overview of instructors' survey responses and then discus the supporting interview data to more closely examine observed patterns.

# 4.1. RQ1: Genre-based theories in L2 writing instruction

The first aim was to examine the theoretical influences of the three genre-based approaches on L2 writing instructors. Teachers were asked to indicate which of the three approaches they 1) were familia enough with to describe to a colleague, and 2) informed their writing instruction. As shown in Table 2, the majority of instructors indicated descriptive familiarity with only one of the three approaches, with ESP being the one most participants were familiar with by a wide margin (in terms of the number of participants reporting familiarity, not in terms of depth of familiarity). ESP was also the approach to genre theory that the largest number of L2 writing instructors identified as informing their pedagogies.

At the same time, it is striking that nearly $3 0 \%$ of the instructors indicated that none of the three approaches informed their teaching, while only $2 . 1 \%$ indicated that they drew from all three schools pedagogically. Notably, this does not preclude unconscious influence of genre theories on pedagogical practices in these classooms, but rather a lack of intentional and conscious application of such knowledge to pedagogy. Participants left comments that often underscored the lack of familiarity with SFL and RGS, which resonates with the strong EAP focus of many of their courses. For instance, P083, an advanced L2 instructor who taught undergraduates academic English in the US, indicated that she was only familiar with ESP. Throughout the interview, i was apparent that her familiarity with the ESP approach to genre was more aresult of her teaching within genre-based courses that were designed with that particular philosophy rather than a personal afinity. he indicated that her approach varie from classto-class, emphasizing issues like "confidence-building" and that her "undamental belief that reading and writing really go together" drive her pedagogical decisions more than the genre theory she studied during her graduate work. In contrast, P102, an L2 writing instructor who taught undergraduate and graduate general English composition in the US, indicated astrong personal alignment with ESP over RGS due to the extent that she felt resonance between ESP and Sociocultural Theory (Vygotsky, 1978), which guided her teaching more broadly. She had strong scholarly views on the benefits of a particular genre theory over the others. Another instructor, P139, who taught undergraduate academic English in the US, also expressed a strong alignment with one of the approaches to genre (SFL, in her case). However, it was based not only on theoretical affliations and preferences, but alo on concrete views of how it impacted learners. As P139 noted, her advocacy for SFL lay in the ability to help learners "correlate [language] to a real situation."

Note: Percentages represent the number of respondents indicating each option out of 141 participants.

Other instructors clarified that while they have considerable knowledge and even interest in particular theories, they are not in an institutionally viable position to implement them. For instance, P108, a doctoral student who taught first-year composition in the US, indicated her L2 writing philosophy is mainly informed by ESP, though she is familiar with all thre theorie. She felt the strongest resonance with ESP needs analysis, lamenting that \*inall the courses that I've taught, I've never had a chance to pick the geres that I want to be teaching, like main assgnments.' Instead, she described rising leaners' awareness of what she rfers to as "fake genres' that are not based on learner needs but are required by the curriculum. Throughout the interview, she reflected on the importance of ESP as an approach to L2 instruction but revealed frustration that she has been unable to teach according to her theoretical values. The degree of pedagogical freedom granted to educators i clearly contex-specific, with some of our interviewees indicating a rigid curriculum to enact and thers teaching in contexts with considerable frdom, such as that described in Li et al.s (2020) close analysis of two EAP instructors' pedagogical decisions.

Relatedly, P068, who had experience teaching undergraduate and graduate academic English courses in both Lithuania and the US, echoed this sentiment, explaining that \*no, its not going to happen in any of those institutions because it i labor and time intensive." She explained how she was able to kind of lobby for more careful selection of the genres in one pedagogical context, but she framed the entire discussion of implementing genre theories in L2 writing pedagogy as a battle against institutional constraints. The issue of freedom to integrate elements of gre theory into theseection of targt genres and pedagogical deigns was a recurring theme, and it call into question some intructors ability to adapt genre foci that meet the modality and communicative needs of students, as highlighted by recent scholarship (e.g., Caplan & Stevens, 2017; Lim & Polio, 2020).

When asked about the source of their knowledge of genre-based theories, 96 instructors $( 6 8 . 1 \% )$ indicated studying at least one of the theories in graduate school. Additionally, 50 $( 3 5 . 5 \% )$ reported reading about them in academic books or textbooks; 42 $( 2 9 . 8 \% )$ indicated they learned about the theory (or theories) at academic conferences; 36 $( 2 5 . 5 \% )$ reported learning about them from colleagues; and 16 $( 1 1 . 3 \% )$ indicated they studied such theories during their bachelors' degrees. In the survey, one participant wrote that they had \*heard about these approaches, but did not know there were clear differences between them."

Overall, there was a greater reported familiarity with and affinity for ESP, relative to the other approaches within the dataset. Interviews highlighted that for some instructors, the theoretical approach is important to their teaching philosophy and decisionmaking as an L2 writing instructor. For others, the issue of genre was more of a site for skills development, and the theoretical ap. proaches to genre were distant theoretical frameworks with lttle bearing on real-life practices. At the same time, intitutional policies and pressures limited the extent that interested practitioners of genre theories could implement them due to the importance of selecting genres.

Notably, instructors were also given an opportunity to identify other genre-based theoretical foundations, and while not allof the identified theories are explicitly theories of genre, some of them account for genre or components of genre theory to a degree. For example, in Task-Based Language Teaching, (TBLT, which was mentioned by one respondent below), a written genre that is authentic and meaningful in the learners context may be regarded as a task, and thus, might be taught tostudents. Thus, apart from ESP, SFL, and RGs, instructors identified the Process-Based Approach (4, $2 . 8 \%$ , Communicative Language Teaching (2, $1 . 4 \% )$ , Concept-Based Instruction (2, $1 . 4 \%$ , Contrastive Content and Language Integrated Teaching (2, $1 . 4 \% )$ , Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling $( 2 , 1 . 4 \% )$ , as well as Communication Theory, Critical Language Awareness, Dynamic Collaborative Writing, TBLT, and Sociocultural Theory (once each). Two instructors also identified their own \*experience" as a theoretical approach to genre-based instruction, while one indicated that they draw from "common sense' when teaching genres.

# 4.2. RQ2: Written genres used in L2 writing instruction

RQ2 examined the written genres taught in these courses - that is, the particular genres that intructors were building their pedagogies around. Instructors were asked to list the geres that students studied or wereasked to produce in the three most recent L2 writing courses they had taught. I total, 554 genres (tokens) were listed across 305 courses. here was large overlap between genres in secondary and undergraduate courses, but graduate course genres differed considerably from these two contexts. For this reason, Table 3 presents the genres in secondary and undergraduate contexts, while Table 4 presents those in graduate courses.

As shown in Table 3, a large number of the reported genres represent esays of various sorts, including the number two spot, which is a somewhat vague and unspecified esay' genre. Overall, he emphasis on essay writing resonates with Nesi and Gardner's (2012) discovery of the prevalence and range of essay writing in UK university contexs, with seven types of esays explicitl identified in our dataset (a topic we return to in the Discussion). There appears to be strong reliance on essay writing in the contexts of the instructors we surveyed. While i is true that some of these genres may have been implemented in multimodal or otherwise dynamic manners, there is nothing to suggest that in their labels. In Table 3, we have included the top 20 most frequently reported genres since the exhaustive list has a rather long tail. Beyond this top 20, there are many more specialized or function-specific written genres that appeared, including: blogs (6), community and place profiles (6), non-profesional emails (3), advertisements (2), magazine articles (2), autoethnographies (1), surveys (1), interview questions (1), and even text messages (1) and fanfiction (2).

In terms of why instructors adopted such genres, P108, an instructor of firs-year composition in the US, commented on the importance of authenticity in genre, over the notion of skill ransferability. Considering how she would go about designing an un. dergraduate L2 writig course in contrast t a previous context in which she taught, she reflected on what she refers to as fake genres in Excerpt 1, raising important questions about the motivation for particular genres in L2 writing pedagogies. She commented:

Excerpt 1: Recalling the curriculum I taught when I was there it was interesting, right? Some interesting, fake genre. People never write [them] .. Speaking of fake genres, its ust a thing everywhere .. You know, to help students get to the point where they can write this fake genre that I want them to write.

Even in her current instructional context, P108 commented that she \*would just throw away everything." She later contrasted these fake genres with solid genres," concluding that they have a place in such courses since they raise students' awareness of audience expectations, even if the audience for many essy-based geres is typically the instructor. Nevertheles, as the conversation continued, P108 talked about the benefits f a small number of "standard" genres, such as summary-response, for the sills that they teach and because it is a type of assignment that students produce in other disciplinary courses.

P037, a writing instructor in an intensive English program in a Bolivian university, noted that academic writing instruction itself is novel in her country. However, she adopts a more moderate position of including esay-based genres in the syllabus as sites of skill and linguistic development while also working to include academic genres to prepare students for specific genres she knows they will encounter yet are unprepared for. Of course, as she noted, this has earned her the image of being a "demanding teacher."

Lastly, in terms of RQ2, the graduate courses shown in Table 4 provide a similarl traditional set of genres in top positions, as the important research and promotional genres of EAP courses are expectedly common. Unlike with undergraduate and secondary writing contexts, there is not a long tal of nnovatie and function-specific gnres listed for the graduate contexts. Apart from the top 10 genres highlighted in Table 4, only a few discipline-specific or less commonly taught genres appear, including job search documents (2), consent forms (1), and posters for presentations (1).

# 4.3. RQ3: Pedagogical activities in L2 writing instruction

The final question, RQ3, turns to the more practical side of teaching L2 writing by asking the instructors to describe the types of activitie they implemented in their 2 writing courses when teaching different genres, as well as those types of activities they do not currently use but would like toin the future. Relatedly, we aked instructors to comment on the common challenges that they and their students faced when teaching and learning L2 writing.

Table 5 provides an overview of the most frequently implemented activities. Overall, it is striking that over $8 4 \%$ of the 141 instructors indicated using peer review and text/model analysis activities in their writing classes. Additionally, over $7 0 \%$ indicated that they used collaborative writing and freewriting activities, and over half simulated test conditions by implementing timed writin/test practice activities.

Shifting attention to Table 6, which shows the types of activities that instructors would like to integrate (but have been unable to for various reasons), several interesting observations can be made. Given the prevalence of corpus-based language pedagogies in recent years and the reurgence f identity-focused language teaching, it i notworth that both corpus analysis and crtive writing activities are at the top of the most desired list. When adding together those intructors who currently make use of particula activities with those who would like to, we can see that nearly all instructors who were surveyed use or want to use text/model analysis $( 9 7 . 2 \% )$ , collaborative writing $( 9 5 . 7 \% )$ , and peer review $( 9 5 \% )$ , with many other instructors using or indicating an interest in freewriting $( 8 3 . 7 \% )$ , timed writing $( 6 4 . 5 \% )$ , sentence translation $( 5 7 . 4 \% )$ , creative writing $( 5 5 . 3 \% )$ , and corpus-based activities $( 5 2 . 4 \% )$ . While the interest in creative writing was somewhat unexpected, unfortunately, instructors provided litle elaboration in the interviews. However, some commented generally on the importance of creating spaces for students to cultivate their relationship with writing.

An important esson about the gaps between pedagogical ideals and realities ran throughout an interview with P024, a writing teacher who has long worked with undergraduates in a Turkish universty context. As positive as she was about her students and teaching, and in spiteof her interest in implementing cllaborative writing, she was acutely aware of the challenges involved in making space for such activities. Specificall, P024 described L2 writing courses as the \*most hated in [her] context because you need to give millions, at alltimes, to the papers in feedback," which students are often not recetive to. Therefore, when working on different genres, she stated that she would like to utilize collaborative writing activities to develop learners' familiarity with giving and receiving feedack, but there isconsiderable resistance In Except 2, she contrasts her experience using collaborative writing activities abroad with the challenges she faces in her current context:

Excerpt 2: I visited many schols over there. Really collaborative work. Giving feedback is part of their culture from the early start .. even in primary school, you can seei. So the whole system is depending on giving feedback to each other - teachers giving feedback to parents, parents giving feedback to the teachers to the students, students to students . But here, although we are a collectie culture .. while working with people, [we do that] individuall .. I'm trying to change this cultre, because peer feedback learning [is important], rightly so.

P024, as a cultural insider, continued to discuss her challenges with implementing collaborative writing in her context in depth. Although we choose not to reproduce the specifics of her critique, it i noteworthy that she references the challenges of adopting an activity from one educational context for leaning in another. Whil she admirablyattempted to train her students for a pedagogy that she views as valuable for learning, this also underscores that education is inextricably linked to the context in which it exists. For example, P139, teaching advanced writing courses in an intensive English program in the US, also noted the dificultie of including novel tasks and pedagogies since the coviD-19 era, as class sizes in her context have nearly doubled. Thus, although many teachers desired to adopt and experiment with various pedagogical activities, there were several factors that prohibited them from doing so.

# 5. Discussion

As illustrated, when it came to RQ1 and investigating the genre-based theories that informed L2 English writing instructors pedagogies, it was notable that relatively few teachers $( 1 3 . 5 \% )$ stated that they could not describe any of the theories to a peer/ colleague. Conversely, most reported being able to describe at least one genre-based theory. By far, ESP was the most familiar $( 8 6 . 5 \% )$ followed by SFL $( 2 4 . 8 \% )$ , and RGS $( 1 5 . 6 \% )$ , respectively. Perhaps most interesting, however, is the clear disconnect that was observed between teachers' reported knowledge of such genre-based theories and their reported pedagogical practices. That is, although 122 writing instructors $( 8 6 . 5 \% )$ claimed they knew of and could describe ESP, SFL, or RGS, almost $3 0 \%$ stated that none of these approaches informed their teaching of L2 writing in their local contexts.

This finding was (admittedly) rather surprising, especially given teachers reported knowledge of the focal theories and their increasing use in many graduate teacher-training programs (e.g, Li et al., 2020; Schwarz & Hamman-Ortiz, 2020). While some writing instructors in r stdy rorted personal affinties for specific aproache (, 102 wth ESP, and P139 with SFL) thers, it semed, relied on their own experience, or as one survey respondent put it, simply used "common sense" when teaching different genres. Stil, other teachers reported that they felt there were institutional barriers blocking their implementation of genre theory (e.g., P068, P108). As noted, multipl participants stated that they felt the use of genre theory was inexorably linked to their (in)ability to select their own genres when teaching. Regardes, this observation of the gap between theory and practice is astark one, which speaks to a growing body of literature that seeks to investigate teachers perceptions and the extent to which they care' about the nexus between theory, research, and practice (see Sato & Lowen, 2019). In this case, instructors self-identified as knowledgeable about a particular genre theory, yet consciously claimed not to draw on it when teaching L2 writing.

At the same time, a sizable body of research on instructors' experiences working within genre-based writing pedagogies has provided insights into teachers decision-making processes. For instance, Tardy et al. (2022) examined the successes and challenges faced by several graduate students who adopted genre-based pedagogies in first-year writing courses. Their findings highlight some of the challenges that teachers are likely to face in specific contexts however, their findings also emphasize the important role that prior education plays in bolstering one's content knowledge and inluencing successes with genre-based approaches. This resonates with the findings of the current study as well, in that $6 8 . 1 \%$ of our participants who reported knowledge of genre theories stated that they learned of them during graduate school. Thus, this finding underscores the importance of training for developing future L2 writing instructors awareness of genre-based approaches, particularly since studies such as Tardy et al. (2022) and others suggest that doing so has the capacity to influence teachers' pedagogical content knowledge and the suceses that they ultimately experience (also see Worden, 2019). Simultaneously, some educators in the current study lamented their limited roles in selecting target genres and activities within their pedagogical contexts, but reearch highlights the difficulties that novice instructors in particular may face when working within genre-based pedagogies across disciplines (e.g., Garcia-Alonso, 2022) and the range of enres learners may benefit from in a given context (e.g., Caplan & Stevens, 2017). As such, genre-based L2 writing instruction may benefit from - as many experienced educators would likely agree - aention to how to select target genres alongside how to teach them.

In turning to RQ2 and teachers reported use of different written genres, we highlighted a number of genres that instructors adopted in undergraduate, secondary, and graduate courses. When examining these data, what we see is an exceedingly large number of usual suspects in argumentative essays, essays' (unspecified), summary and response, narratives, compare and contrast, and others. As noted, studies such as Lim and Polio (2020) have increasingly provided evidence of the changing nature of writing across academic and professional setig. I such settings, writing is rapidly becoming more digitl and multimodal in nature, requring L2 (and1) writers to leverage lingustic and non-linguistic modes, in addition to being able to use a variety of digital tool for completing uch tasks (see Kesser, 2024). In our current dataset, there were some examples of genres that could be categorized i such a manner (e.g., blogs, emails community and place profiles, adertisements, and text messages). However, the use of such genres tended to be quite rare. When compared to the major genre families reported by Nesi and Gardner (2012), we can see that all major familie ae represented (that is, explanation and exercise to demonstrate knowledge; critique and esay to develop rasoning skils; rearch report, literatre surveys, and methodology recounts as part of research practice; problem question, proposal deign specification, and case study for professional purposes; and narrativ recounts and empathy writing, directed towards non-specialist audiences). However, in most cases, the

majority of instructors appeared to be focusing solely on traditional, monomodal, tes-riented genre, as well s relying on seemingly vague essay enres. This indicates that there may beconsiderable room for innovation (also see McGrath & Negretti, 2023), especially since many of our focal participants explicitly commented on the artificial nature of those genres they used, and these genres disconnectednes from real-world situations that their students were likely to encounter in their lives (g., P108's comment in excerpt 1 about teaching \*fake genres"; also see Tardy, 2019b). One question that cearly arises is: Why are so many intructors using such genres i, in fact, they believe them to be artificial? Although some of our interview data pointed to potential explanations (e.g., institutional requirements), unfortunately, we are unable to draw broader conclusions about those sampled in our study (also see Tardy, 2017 for a related discussion). This represents the first major pedagogical implication of ths study, which is that L2 writing pedagogy may more usefull prepare learners for writing tasks beyond language and composition courses if it targets participation in genres which more closely match those of their pedagogical contexts in purpose, modality, and form. To this end, beyond an emphass broady on multimodality, it also may be advisable for L2 writing instructors to connect the writing tass in their courses with the disciplinary demands in their teaching context. Given the prominence of ESP in the instructors responses, we do note that a local needs analysis could be a suitable means of profiling the target genres that students are likely to encounter, when feasible.

We also note that when implementing genres in their respective classrooms, the L2 writing teachers in our study tended to adopt a myriad of pedagogical activities. Many teachers leveraged popular and commonly researched activities such as peer review, text/ model analysis, and collaborative writing, among others. Given that many teachers reported adopting ESP and/or SFL approaches in practice, some of these activities are to be expected. For example, to some extet, both ESP and SFL approaches advocate for the use of text/model analysis as a means of helping learners make sense of the target genres and academic or professinal communities who use them. Still, many teachers also noted that they deired to use some of these activitie g., collaborative writig in addition to others (e.g., corpus analysis and creative writing), but they were unable to do so because of thir instructional context. This highlights the importance of attending to a variety of pedagogical approaches in language teacher education contexts, but also on the importance of training educators to advocate for pedagogical approaches they feel will lead to beneficial outcomes in their contexts.

Although the current study yielded numerous insights into the nature of genre-based theory, writen genres, and the pedagogical activities used in L2 writing instruction, i is not without limitations. First we note that the sample in our study was predominantl US. educated individuals $( 7 3 \% )$ , with most also working in different US-based contexts $( 6 0 . 3 \% )$ . Although we distributed the survey broadly to those working in various countries, the highest number of respondents ultimately came from the Us. Additionally, despite sending the survey to universties and programs internationall, some teachers from other countrie never responded (e.g., Australia New Zealand). Thus, particularly when it comes to certain educational contexts such as Australia, we note that the final sample included in our study likely does not capture the true cope or richnessof genre-based approaches that are adopted by some intructors. After all since SFL is a popular and wellestalished part of pedagogy in contexts such as Australia, the fact that no Australian-based teachers responded to our survey may account for the relatively low percentage of those who reported adopting SFL in practice (for more, see Accurso & Walsh Mar, 2024). As such, future reearch may examine L2 writing instructors' knowledge (and slf-reported practices) more ocall. Relatedly, of those who completed our survey, most had backgrounds in applied linguisics, second language acquisition, or TEsoL. We had few participants with English literature or composition backgrounds. This may (or may not) partly explain why so few respondents reported being influenced by RGS in practice. Nevertheless, our study focused on the pedagogies of those who taught L2 writing.

The data from our study support other future research directions, and particularly for those who are interested in EAP and genre. based approaches to L2 writing pedagogy. For example, the data from this study clearly suggest that there is aneed for more research probing the connections between genres that are being taught in L2 writing classooms and the genres that students encounter in their academic disciplines and future career. There is some exsting literature that discuse the diffrent gere chains that 2 writers may engage in, espeialy in academia (se Nes  Gadner, 2012 ad, 2009). Hower, itleis know about the xent to which students actually engage with the geres that are being taught in their writing classroms. Thus future studies might attempt to track students Iongitudinally within 2 writing programs, first when they are enrolled in their primary disciplines, and then during their carers post-graduation. Similarly, studies that integrate learners voices are needed. That is, to what extent do students find the genres they are being taught useful? Do they find these genres and/or skill transferrable to the types of writing they are doing beyond the classrom? Research of this nature is needed to better understand the nexus between current istructional practices and learners perceived utility of those practices.

# 6. Conclusion

This study investigated L2 writing teachers current use of genre-based theories genres, and activities in their local contexts. Our study found that while genre-based theories (primarily ESP) were familiar to writing teachers, there was a considerable disconnect between theory and practice, with nearly $3 0 \%$ of instructors self-reporting that their writing pedagogies were not informed by any genre-based approach. Interestingly, intructors overwhelmingly tended to adopt more traditional, monomodal, test-oriented genres rather than digital, multimodal ones. Teachers also reported using a large number f activities to teach those genres, yet they stated that there were many more they would like to implement but were unable to. In cloing, we call for future studies to investigate the (dis)connections between what is being taught in L2 writing classrooms and what learners report encountering in their academic and professional lives.
