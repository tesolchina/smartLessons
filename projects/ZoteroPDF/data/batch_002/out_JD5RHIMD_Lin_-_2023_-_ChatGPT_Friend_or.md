This short communication discusses the impact of ChatGPT on the field of corpus linguistics, particularly its potential as a concordancer. As a corpus linguist and app developer, the author reflects on how ChatGPT's ease of use, efficiency, and popularity could challenge traditional concordancers, and explores ways in which ChatGPT could be used to generate concordances and frequency lists.

# Introduction

ChatGPT was launched in November 2022. Immediately, it took the world by storm, gaining over 1 million registered users in just 5 days. Everyone jumped on the bandwagon to discover how ChatGPT could be used to increase their productivity and shorten the time it takes to complete everyday tasks. The most popular uses of ChatGPT, so far, are to compose emails and generate computer code. As ChatGPT appears so capable and versatile, corpus software developers, including myself, were intrigued by its success. ChatGPT has set new goals in terms of accessibility and popularity for corpus software development.

I was amongst the first million users to start using ChatGPT. During that time (November 2022), I was revising a chapter (Lin, 2024) that introduces and persuades English language teachers to use corpora in teaching. The two dots (i.e., ChatGPT and corpora) did not connect until I received the Editors' invitation to share my views on the impact of ChatGPT on corpus linguistics. My spontaneous response to the Editors surprised even myself: ChatGPT could bring an end to my years of hard work developing concordancers and promoting concordancing in teaching. How can we beat ChatGPT in terms of ease of use, efficiency, and popularity? How do we persuade learners to spend time reading concordances from now on when they can get answers much quicker by sending a query to ChatGPT? Later, I compiled a list of the use cases of corpus and concordancing demonstrated in the book chapter (Lin, 2024) and started testing if it might indeed be much easier and faster to get answers from ChatGPT instead. The list is as follows:

2. Retrieving authentic spoken texts for illustrating communicative strategies (e.g., how to raise questions using different levels of politeness)   
3. Helping learners correct their errors in their English composition   
4. Suggesting vocabulary items to help students write on an unfamiliar topic   
5. Explaining the differences between synonyms (e.g., great and large)   
6. Helping teachers find suitable reading/video input   
7. Highlighting potentially difficult words in texts for students

Writing great prompts is the key to getting high-quality and quick answers from ChatGPT. Given great prompts, it is fair to say that ChatGPT passes with flying colors. It provides monolingual/bilingual sentence examples, generates spoken texts to illustrate communicative strategies, and helps learners correct their errors, amongst other things. ChatGPT takes only seconds to provide an answer. What's more, ChatGPT can be instructed to respond in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, Russian, Chinese, and Korean, following prompts in any of these languages. This linguistic flexibility with prompt and response language will be particularly welcomed by second language (L2) beginners. In the chapter (Lin, 2024), I also offer advice to teachers on designing L2 English lessons that incorporate concordancing. On reflection, such advice may now appear superfluous because drafting a lesson plan is well within the capabilities of the all-purpose AI tool ChatGPT.

# "If you can't beat them, join them

Having seen how impressive ChatGPT is, I started wondering if it could be used as a concordancer. Instead of using ChatGPT to obtain quick answers to L2 usage questions, teachers could show learners how to prompt ChatGPT to generate dozens of examples illustrating the usage of a word form, lemma or part-of-speech in context. Reading such 'concordances' not only trains learners' ability to observe how language is used in different communicative contexts, but it also allows them to relate their own experiences with the language patterns. This deep level of engagement enabled by reading concordances makes it more likely for learners to remember and retain knowledge about L2 usage (see Involvement Load Hypothesis, Laufer and Hulstijn, 2001).

From the perspective of concordancer users, ChatGPT offers unparalleled accessibility and ease of use, two problems that have been facing concordancer development. Online concordancers with built-in corpora ready for the L2 classroom often require a subscription fee. Each concordancer has its strengths and weaknesses (see Lin, 2024, for a review), which means that learning the use of just one concordancer will be insufficient. The series of steps to follow to retrieve information also vary across concordancers and require learning and practice. Given the complexity associated with concordancer use, the frustrations that some users experience when teaching or learning the use of concordancers are perhaps understandable. To overcome the barriers experienced by learners who may be unfamiliar with technology, some corpus linguists (such as Boulton, 2010) have experimented with and argued for the use of printed concordances in the classroom.

Given appropriate prompts, ChatGPT should be able to generate concordances and frequency lists. There is no need to pay, switch between multiple concordancers, or remember which buttons to click. Many learners may already be using ChatGPT for other purposes anyway, so discovering a new use of ChatGPT as a concordancer would be great news to them.

# The authenticity of ChatGPT-generated language

ChatGPT could be a game-changer in concordancer development. The question is whether the language generated by ChatGPT can be considered authentic. In other words, does it represent language produced by a real speaker for a real audience conveying a real message?1 Authenticity was not a concern previously because older versions of ChatGPT could access documents via hyperlinks, which means that authentic texts regardless of length could be submitted for processing. However, the function to read in documents via hyperlinks has been deprecated, leaving users the only options to paste their own text in the textbox of limited size or to make ChatGPT analyse its generated sentences.

The fact is that the authenticity of the language generated by ChatGPT remains to be evaluated. At the time of writing, ChatGPT ran on Generative Pretrained Transformer version 3.5 (aka GPT-3.5), which was trained on an estimated 45 terabytes of text data. The human language in the mega-corpus should be authentic, despite the lack of information about the composition or representativeness of the megacorpus used to train GPT-3.5 from OpenAI, the company that developed GPT-3.5.

A related study by Cai et al. (2023) assessed ChatGPT and confirmed that it possesses human linguistic abilities. ChatGPT succeeded in 10 out of 12 tests, such as the ability to associate unfamiliar words with different meanings depending on their forms, draw inferences, and gloss over errors. It failed to prefer shorter over longer words and to use context to disambiguate syntactic ambiguities. Clearly, that ChatGPT possesses linguistic abilities seen in humans does not guarantee that the language it generates will resemble real language in use. As a corpus linguist who works with spoken data, I am naturally concerned about whether the language generated by ChatGPT will accurately reflect the common features of spoken communication, including hesitations, false starts, reformulations, unfinished utterances, and fillers. The presence of these features is one of many aspects that would indicate the authenticity of ChatGPT-generated language and the extent to which we could use ChatGPT as a concordancer.

# Prompting ChatGPT to generate concordances

Assuming that the language generated by ChatGPT is authentic, prompts can be developed to make ChatGPT generate concordances, in addition to producing frequency lists. Since ChatGPT is excellent at handling terminology, the word list that it generates is arguably more intelligent than those generated by many existing concordancers on the market. For example, 'Hong Kong' will be correctly recognized as a term, as opposed to two words. Furthermore, it is possible to engineer prompts so that it not only generates concordances but also provides immediate and personalized feedback on beginners' attempts at interpreting the concordances.

While ChatGPT can be instructed to work using simple natural language (e.g., "generate a concordance of the word 'amazing"), creating concordances that approximate the typical outputs of concordancers in both form and function requires careful design and repeated testing. This area of expertise is known as prompt engineering. Once a prompt has been created, it can be shared with other users who can copy and paste it into their ChatGPT. Alternatively, a web browser add-in can be developed to bypass the need for prompt copying and editing, thus simplifying the use of the ChatGPT concordancer.

As a corpus software developer (see Lin, 2017, 2022, for my corpus tools), I have attempted to engineer prompts that can turn ChatGPT into a concordancer. It should be noted that these prompts:

were written for ChatGPT Plus running GPT-4;   
may need to be updated from time to time to remain compatible with the latest version of ChatGPT;   
. were designed for use with ChatGPT only; using them on other AI tools may generate different results;   
. were exceedingly lengthy and complex because they had to be squeezed into a single prompt for this demonstration ;2 and   
. can be modified to suit users' needs.

There are also general usage tips. If ChatGPT starts producing strange-looking outputs, users may try:

. starting a new thread on ChatGPT;   
: prompting ChatGPT to 'ignore previous instructions' to clear its memory and start again;   
. clicking "regenerate response" if there are inaccuracies in the generated response;   
. repeating the original task instructions after a while (because ChatGPT has limited memory capacity and tends to forget the original instructions after a few conversational turns);

. asking ChatGPT to "continue to generate your response below" if the generated response is incomplete.

# Prompt 1: concordancing with ChatGPT

To use ChatGPT as a concordancer, copy and paste the following prompt to ChatGPT, replacing (node) with the term to term in quotation marks.

In linguistics, a concordance presents all occurrences of a word or phrase in a text or corpus in their context. It provides information about the lexical and grammatical features of the language used, including part of speech, collocations, and relationships with other words in the text. The computer software that generates concordances is called a concordancer.

Imagine you are a concordancer. You need to generate a concordance consisting of 25 sentences embedding the term (node). The sentences should illustrate how the term is typically used in English. Present the concordance using a table that can be exported into a spreadsheet and make sure you meet all 3 requirements regarding the format of the table listed below:

Requirement 1: Each sentence should be split into 3 parts and presented in 3 separate columns. Column 1 presents the words before the node, Column 2 presents the node itself, and Column 3 presents the words after the node.

Take this sentence as an example: The weather today is so beautiful that I do not mind getting sunburnt. The node is "beautiful'. It must be split and presented in the table as such:

Column 1: The weather today is so Column 2: \*\*beautiful\*\* Column 3: that I do not mind getting sunburnt.

Requirement 2: Column 1 and Column 3 must both contain at least 3 words. There are two exceptions that can be made. First, if the node is the first word of the sentence, Column 1 can be empty. Second, if the node is the last word of the sentence, Column 3 can be empty.

Requirement 3: The node in Column 2 must be bolded.

Once you have generated the table, you must then ask me this question using exact wordings: I can give you additional information about lexical and grammatical features of the language used in the concordance, including information about the context of the sentences, the genres in which the sentences will most likely occur, and details about the part of speech of the node. I can also carry out a simple collocation analysis for you. Alternatively, you can also practice analysing the concordance and interpret the data presented on your own. I can give you feedback on your analysis and help you improve. Let me know what you want to do.

Only when I have answered your question should you offer me 1 of the following 5 options:

1. Context: Based on the concordance you generated, summarise the contexts in which the sentences will most likely occur. Once you have given me the additional information I requested, you can ask me again if I need other information that I have not yet asked for.

2. Genre: Based on the concordance you generated, categorise the concordance lines into their specific genres. Summarise the genres in which the sentences will most likely occur. Categorise the concordance lines with reference to the genre categories of the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COcA). The genres used in COCA are: Spoken, Fiction, Magazine, Newspaper, Academic, Blogs, Other Web Pages, and TV/Movies. Once you have given me the additional information I requested, you can ask me again if I need other information that I have not yet asked for.

3. Part of speech: Based on the concordance you generated, specify the part of speech (POs) of the node $\langle \mathrm { \bf n o d e } \rangle$ in the concordance lines. If there are more than 1 POs for the node, provide an example for each type of POs. Once you have given me the additional information I requested, you can ask me again if I need other information that I have not yet asked for.   
4. Collocation analysis: Based on the concordance you generated, carry out a collocate analysis and present the results. Once you have given me the additional information I requested, you can ask me again if I need other information that I have not yet asked for.   
5. Practice: If I choose to do the practice, you must provide guidance on how I should do it. The aim of the practice is to help me learn how to interpret the data presented in the concordance. First, ask me if I want to start the practice without any tips. Only when I have answered your question, should you provide 1 of the following 2 instructions:

Do not need tips: If I indicate that I do not need tips, ask me to freely write my analysis, including my observations and interpretations of the data presented in the concordance. You must give feedback and suggestions on how to improve each time I give you my analysis. Ask me If I want to continue practicing or if I want to end the practice. If I choose to end the practice, summarise your feedback on my performance.

Need tips: If I indicate that I want tips, provide tips on how to interpret the data based on context, genre, part of speech, and collocates. Present your tips in bullet points. After providing me with tips, ask me if I am ready to begin the practice. If I say yes, ask me to freely write my analysis, including my observations and interpretations of the data presented in the concordance. You must give feedback and suggestions on how to improve each time I give you my analysis. Ask me If I want to continue practicing or if I want to end the practice. If I choose to end the practice, summarise your feedback on my performance.

# Further options

The above prompt can be edited to suit personal needs. For example, there is the option to:

. specify the part of speech of the node, e.g., You need to generate a concordance consisting of 25 sentences embedding the node (node) as an adjective. . specify the genre of the concordance lines, e.g., Show me only sentences that most likely occur in newspapers.

# Prompt 2: generating frequency lists

To generate frequency lists, copy and paste the following prompt to ChatGPT.

In corpus linguistics, a frequency list is a table that lists the top most frequent lexical items in a specific text in descending order of frequency.

I will now give you instructions on how to generate frequency lists for a text that I will provide.   
First, you should ask me to provide you with the text.   
After receiving the text, you must ask me: I can generate four types of frequency lists based on the text. Which type of frequency list do you want: (1) A word list, (2) A frequency list by lemma, (3) A frequency list by part-of speech; and (4) A frequency list by collocation? Based on my response, you must offer to present 1 of the following 4 frequency lists:

1. A word list: Generate a table presenting the top 25 most frequent words in the text and rank them by frequency. If multiple words have the same frequency, you must assign them the same rank, and continue ranking the subsequent words without skipping any rank numbers. Make sure that the table consists of 3 columns. Column 1 presents the rank of the word; Column 2 presents the word; and Column 3 presents the frequency at which the word appears in the text. The table must be ready for export into a spreadsheet. Once you have generated the table, offer to give examples of sentences for any of the words listed. Once you have given me all the information I requested, you must ask me if I want any other examples or if I want you to continue to generate any other types of frequency lists.

2. A frequency list by lemma: In English, words can be put into groups if they meet all three criteria: 1) they have the same stem; 2) they belong to the same major word class; and 3) they differ only in inflection and/or spelling. The canonical form of a word is called the lemma (plural form: lemmata). For example, the verb lemma 'walk' consists of the words 'walk', 'walked', walking' and 'walks'. The lemma is typically presented as the headword in dictionaries. If I ask for a frequency list by lemma, you need to first convert every word in the text I provided into lemmata. Then, you need to generate a table presenting the top 25 most frequent lemmata in the text and rank them by frequency. If multiple lemmata have the same frequency, you must assign them the same rank, and continue ranking the subsequent lemmata without skipping any rank numbers. Make sure that the table consists of 3 columns. Column 1 presents the rank of the lemma; Column 2 presents the lemma; and Column 3 presents the frequency at which the lemma appears in the text. The table must be ready for export into a spreadsheet. Once you have generated the table, you must ask me if I want you to generate any other types of frequency lists.

3. A frequency list by part of speech: Generate a table presenting the top 25 most frequent part of speech in the text and rank them by frequency. If multiple parts of speech have the same frequency, you must assign them the same rank, and continue ranking the subsequent parts of speech without skipping any rank numbers. Make sure that the table consists of 3 columns. Column 1 presents the rank of the part of speech; Column 2 presents the part of speech; and Column 3 presents the frequency at which the part of speech appears in the text. The table must be ready for export into a spreadsheet. Once you have generated the table, offer to provide examples for any part of speech listed. If I ask for examples, present the examples in a table with 2 columns. Column 1 is the example, and Column 2 is the frequency that the example appears in the text. Once you have given me all the information I requested, you can ask me again if I want any other examples or if I want you to generate any other types of frequency lists.

4. A frequency list by collocation: Generate a table presenting the top 25 most frequent collocation in the text and rank them by frequency. If multiple collocations have the same frequency, you must assign them the same rank, and continue ranking the subsequent collocations without skipping any rank numbers. Make sure that the table consists of 3 columns. Column 1 presents the rank of the collocation; Column 2 presents the collocation; and Column 3 presents the frequency at which the collocation appears in the text. The table must be ready for export into a spreadsheet. Once you have generated the collocation frequency list, you must ask me if I want you to generate any other types of frequency lists.

# Further options

The above prompt can be edited to suit different needs. For example, it is possible to:

. specify the part of speech when generating word lists, e,g., Generate a frequency list that presents the top 25 most frequent nouns in the text.

. exclude grammatical words when generating the lists, e.g., Generate a frequency list of lemmata that presents the top 25 most frequent lemmata in the text. Exclude all grammatical words including articles, pronouns, and conjunctions.   
: generate a frequency list that incorporates information about part of speech and lemma, e.g., Generate a frequency list that presents the top 25 most frequent words in the text with information about their lemma and part of speech. Present the frequency list using a table that can be exported into a spreadsheet. There should be 4 columns. Column 1 presents the word; Column 2 presents the lemma; Column 3 presents the part of speech; and Column 4 presents the frequency that the word appears in the text.

# Using ChatGPT as a concordancer: some personal reflections

Driven by optimism about the power of ChatGPT and the desire to develop a new use of the AI tool, I attempted to engineer prompts that can turn ChatGPT into a concordancer. It is fair to say that this hands-on experience gave me a renewed understanding of the tool and its impact on corpus linguistics: ChatGPT may not be as intelligent as I first imagined. I have already written exceedingly long prompts to guide ChatGPT Plus to generate the outputs I needed and attempted many different ways to present my instructions. Yet, ChatGPT Plus, running the latest and most promising GPT-4, failed to fully replicate two basic functions of standard concordancers, namely performing a keyness analysis and a collocation analysis. Although ChatGPT demonstrates knowledge of keyword-in-context (Kwic), making it produce a concordance in KwIC took me two days because ChatGPT does not yet have sufficient intelligence to comprehend instructions that are slightly more complex. Despite my best effort, the AI tool still failed to understand the concept of span so that each concordance line will present more than one sentence with a specified character count. Having seen how ChatGPT managed to generate a lesson plan that introduces concordancing to learners within seconds, I got it to generate a lesson plan that introduces learners to the use of ChatGPT as a concordancer for facilitating English learning. That has pushed ChatGPT Plus far beyond its limits, probably because this idea is completely new and has never come up in its training data. ChatGPT generated a lesson plan nonetheless, but the lesson plan was the same as the previous one except that this time the name of the concordancer changed from AntConc to ChatGPT. This indicates that ChatGPT fails to grasp the essence of such a lesson. This is unsurprising because ChatGPT does not actually have expertise in English language teaching and is unable to create something new (what I refer to as the leap from zero to one in the process of innovation).

In my opinion, if teachers are interested in experimenting with the ChatGPT prompts above with their L2 English learners in the classroom, the lesson should provide guidance on:

: the rationale, pros, and cons of using ChatGPT as a concordancer for exploring patterns of English usage;   
. the structure of the prompts presented;   
: the customization of the prompts to suit personal needs;   
. interpretation of the advice from ChatGPT;   
.the uncertainty surrounding the authenticity of the language generated by ChatGPT;   
: the need to be critical and cautious about the responses generated by ChatGPT; when in doubt, always cross-check with other credible sources (the technology is still under development and ChatGPT responses could be wrong)   
. strategies when interacting with ChatGPT, e.g., asking for explanations and clarifications or regenerating responses when needed,

being direct and specific about one's needs, and giving immediate feedback to ChatGPT in case of inaccurate responses.

# Concluding remarks

In this short communication, I considered the impact of ChatGPT on corpus linguistics as a corpus linguist and app developer. I was particularly interested in exploring the feasibility of using ChatGPT as a concordancer because this might allow learners and teachers to benefit from both concordancing and ChatGPT. The authenticity of the language generated by ChatGPT was my biggest concern at the beginning, mainly because ChatGPT has deprecated the function to read in external documents via hyperlinks. However, as I experimented with engineering prompts that would make ChatGPT approximate some basic functions of a concordancer, I discovered the limits of the current version of the tool. I am hopeful that these limitations will be overcome, given the substantial financial and human resources invested into perfecting the technology.

While corpus tool developers are still a long way from developing new concordancers that can match ChatGPT in terms of ease of use, efficiency and popularity, the outlook for corpus tool developers may not be too bad after all.
