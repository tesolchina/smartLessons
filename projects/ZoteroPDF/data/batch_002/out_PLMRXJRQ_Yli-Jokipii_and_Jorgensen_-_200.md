# Abstract

The purpose of the present study is to investigate, within the textual framework of academic journalese, what happens to Danish and Finnish writers’ English texts when edited by native English-speaking editors for publication on the World Wide Web. We use the term academic journalese to describe texts written by researchers or professionals with a background in research that are easily available to large audiences outside the academic world. By using rhetorical, text linguistic, and editorial concepts in the analysis, we have traced and identified the types of changes to which a number of texts have been subjected during editing to make them compatible with editorial requirements for the genre and standards for UK English. Comparisons between the edited and unedited versions of our corpus documents show that adjustments occur in both directions along the explicitness–implicitness dimension and are frequent in both Finnish and Danish texts. The results further suggest that certain features that have in previous studies emerged as typical of native Finnish writers’ English texts, are shared by native Danish writers as well.

# 1. Introduction

This study is about the qualities of academic journalese produced by Finnish and Danish writers, and subsequently edited professionally by native English speakers. The term academic journalese is here employed to describe the relatively recent type of texts written by researchers or professionals with a background in research that is easily available to large audiences outside the academic world. In particular, we refer to texts that are freely available on the Internet, because they are accessible to any reader with or without an academic affiliation, including seekers of specific information and even the odd ‘‘surfer.’’ Nevertheless, such texts have typically been designed to address particular groups or bodies of decision makers whose professional duty and interest is to remain updated on what happens in the research world. These groups cover a wide spectrum of interests, including business and finance, government, public administration, and insider interest groups such as labour and employer unions.

Academic journalese differs from conventional English for academic purposes (EAP) writing both in content and design. For example, texts belonging to the genre of academic journalese do not make reference to theoretical frameworks, methodologies, principles of analysis, results or enunciated conclusions. Instead, these texts tend to be short, with undocumented arguments and few or no references. Academic journalese thus represents a hybrid between EAP and journalistic writing, a blending of the established characteristics of different genres that Bhatia (1993, 2000) aptly describes as mixing genres. In terms of text types (Werlich, 1976), these texts contain narrative and expository features, with little or no argumentation. It is the narrative element that gives such texts a journalistic feel, with the core of the text covering the questions of who, what, where and why, and occasionally complemented by metatextual commentary. In contrast, purely academic genres are typically rich in argumentation and practically devoid of narrative elements (Swales, 1990).

Within the textual framework of academic journalese, the purpose of this study is to investigate what happens to Danish and Finnish writers’ English texts when edited by native English-speaking editors for publication on the World Wide Web. Our aim is thus to trace and identify the types of changes to which a number of texts have been subjected during the editing process in order to make them compatible with editorial requirements for the genre and standards of UK English. This will be done by employing text linguistic, rhetorical and editorial concepts in the analysis. The text linguistic concepts employed here cover the cohesive properties of texts, including ellipsis, repetition, reference and conjunction, which together have an effect on the natural flow or rhythm of the text. We use the term rhetorical to focus on the strategic aspect of language use. Thus, while text linguistic concepts are adopted here to describe the qualities of text, we use rhetorical concepts to discuss text-external issues, such as the writer’s strategic choices. Finally, we use the term editorial to point to changes introduced by the editors, such as deletion or insertion of an item.

The incentive for this study materialised during our earlier intercultural investigation into the rhetorical treatment of contextual issues in Danish and Finnish writers’ documents (Jorgensen & Yli-Jokipii, in press). During that research process, we observed that there seems to be certain, previously undocumented variation in how non-native writers and native editors code explicitness and tolerate implicitness in the type of professional discourse investigated.

# 1.1. Research questions and hypotheses

We have posed the following two main questions for this genre study, each with its own specific focus: (1) what types of changes are made by native editors to texts written by non-native English writers? And (2) how do English texts written by Finnish and Danish professionals differ from each other?

Each of these questions may be linked to a particular cultural hypothesis. The first question allows for the hypothesis that editorial changes introduced by native English editors increase the explicitness of a message rather than decrease it. The changes are inserted to make the text conform to the expectations of readers with a ‘‘writer-responsible’’ (Hinds, 1987) cultural background who will be looking for rhetorical markers of explicitness.

The cultural hypothesis underlying the second research question concerns the variation between the Danish and Finnish unedited texts. The hypothesis is that differences exist across our text corpus that can be attributed to the different native language characteristics. Danish and English belong to the same Germanic group of the Indo-European language family, whereas Finnish is a totally different, Finno-Ugrian language deriving from non-Indo-European languages. In particular, it is expected that Danish writers would display comfortable use of the definite article the in its referential1 function, whereas Finnish writers are expected to encounter problems with the use of this rhetorical-grammatical device, for which they have no parallel in their native language.

Regarding the studies underlying the present research, we may note that while there is considerable development in theoretical approaches, there has been only slight variation in the type of material used in EAP writing research. This is due to the tradition of the research field with its primary focus on the genre of scientific research articles. Ventola and Mauranen (1990, 1992) employed a text linguistic approach to contrasting Finnish and English; (see also Mauranen, 1993); Clyne (1987a,b) compared English and German academic writing within a discourse analytical framework, heeding the structural aspects of texts, while Swales (1990) incorporated the effect of context into the study of EAP writing through the concepts of communicative purpose, discourse community and move structure in the tradition of applied genre analysis. As Hyland and Hamp-Lyons (2002: p. 7) point out, the concept of genre is increasingly important from the perspective of the growth in the use of electronic discourses. A third research strand may be called intercultural rhetoric. This is a wide field which draws on research produced within the framework of cross-cultural studies and, in particular, on contrastive rhetoric in the tradition initiated by Kaplan (1966, see also 1988) and represented by scholars such as Connor (1996), Connor and Kaplan (1987), and Kachru (1996). In addition, there is a body of literature on academic writing with a primarily instructional task (Coffin et al., 2002; Hyland, 2002; Swales & Feak, 2001); some take an interest in contrastive issues in this field (Belcher & Braine, 1995; Grabe & Kaplan, 1996; Tringham, 2004), while others deal with individual problems in EAP writing, such as the writer’s presence in text (Hyland, 1999) or the social ramifications of EAP writing (Hyland, 2000; Swales, 1998). Furthermore, our research was inspired by literature focusing on language issues in the European or global context (e.g. Connor et al., 1995; Coulmas, 1991; House, 2001; Leppa¨nen, 2003; Phillipson, 2003; Wagner, 2001), and by literature launched on a more national basis, such as Hiidenmaa (2003), who is concerned with the status of the native Finnish language in the global drive to use English in various walks of life, and Wilson (2002), who studied the status of English among EAP professionals in one Finnish university. Finally, we need to point out that we have been unable to locate studies producing contrasting results for Danish and English academic writing, which provides another motivation for the current research project.

The present research seeks to draw on the variety offered by these traditions in order to test the foregoing hypotheses. Thus, we are able to employ certain text linguistic concepts, such as cohesion, ellipsis, and reference to help establish the rhetorical qualities of the genre investigated. Topmost of these are explicitness and implicitness.

# 2. Explicitness and implicitness

Explicitness and implicitness are contrasting terms that describe the text’s rhetorical quality. In explicit texts, the message is produced in an overt, straightforward manner. This makes it easy to read and process, whereas implicit messages take the reader in the opposite direction (see Mauranen, 1993: pp. 171–186). Explicitness and implicitness result from a writer-responsible or reader-responsible rhetorical strategy, respectively, to use the familiar phrase introduced by Hinds (1987) to explain cultural differences in L2 writing. A writer-responsible writing policy involves taking the reader through the text with explicit codes throughout, while a reader-responsible strategy allows implicitness and counts more on the reader’s ability and willingness to make inferences.

From a text linguistic point of view, explicitness and implicitness are connected with the use of cohesive devices. The concept of cohesive device is here understood as referring to the linguistic item that contributes to the unity of the text. Unity in text results from a situation in which different linguistic items hang together through cohesive ties (Georgakopoulou & Goutsos, 1997; Halliday & Hasan, 1976), such as plans–they–them.

Halliday and Hasan (1976) identify five groups of linguistic items that create cohesion. These are reference, substitution, ellipsis, conjunction and the extensive class of lexical cohesion (for an in-depth commentary on approaches to cohesion, see Tanskanen, 2000). In the present study, we modified these categories to trace the methods in which explicitness was increased or reduced by the editors. The categories employed include ellipsis and other deletive strategies, repetition and insertive strategies, reference-derived strategies, and finally conjunction and embedding.

# 2.1. Ellipsis and deletion

Ellipsis has been characterised as a ‘‘zero device’’. It occurs when there is a slot for the particular item in the syntactic structure concerned, but that slot has not been filled. The element that has been ellipted is—or should be—obvious from the surrounding context. The part of writing that may be ellipted is primarily a Noun Phrase (NP), a Verb Phrase (VP) or a somewhat longer stretch, including clauses. An ellipted item functions as a link to a part of text, and is thus an implicit device. Usually the link is anaphoric, pointing backwards to the previous text.

On the surface, deletion and ellipsis may appear the same. However, ellipsis may be explained as a rhetorical strategy performed by way of deletion to obtain increased linguistic cohesion in a text, at the expense of explicitness. Deletion, on the other hand, may be perceived as an editorial strategy reflecting generic style and situational preferences.

# 2.2. Repetition and insertion

Repetition belongs to the group of lexical cohesive devices that represent cohesion achieved through reiteration (Halliday & Hasan, 1976; Tanskanen, 2000). As a rhetorical device, repetition has a twofold effect. With its strong potential for adding explicitness, it maximises the impact of the cues that contribute to intended understanding. At the same time, however, repetition may easily impair the text’s intellectual appearance in the eyes of the reader and may contribute negatively towards a more colourless, almost monotonous quality of text.

Repetition does not merely affect individual lexical elements such as NPs or VPs, but concerns the more global aspect of the text, being frequently connected with the information structure of a particular passage. The term information structure is here employed to describe the thematic progression of the text, i.e. how the matter is presented to the reader in view of old, already given, and new information in order to help the reader to decode the text as a coherent and an informative piece of writing (see, for example, Firbas, 1986).

Regarding Finnish text production strategies, Ventola and Mauranen (1990, 1992) and Mauranen (1993) found that Finnish academics who write research articles in some of the natural sciences, and in medicine in particular, had problems with the coding of given and new information. They tended to put new information at the beginning of sentences, making the theme element heavy and marked, while native English writers would thematise old information and code it with the grammatical subject, thus employing an unmarked theme. These text linguistic aspects are—as far as Finnish and English are concerned—widely documented by Ventola and Mauranen (1990, 1992), and relevant to the present work’s analytical treatment of repetition.

Explicitness may be naturally increased by adding an NP, a VP or a clause to the text. The term insertion is used here to refer to such editorial policy.

# 2.3. Reference-derived changes

The term reference-derived change is employed here to refer to cases in which the editor has made changes in the referential environment of the text. Reference is an additional cohesive device, which may be instantiated through the use of a number of lexical items. In this study, we shall specifically focus on personal and demonstrative pronouns, complemented with the definite article in those instances where it seems to be serving an indisputably referential purpose.

# 2.4. Conjunction and embedding

Conjunctions are lexical items normally placed between two clauses to show the relationship between the clauses (Scollon & Scollon, 1995). In other words, conjunctions frequently function as discourse markers or cues to help the reader arrive at the intended interpretation (Knott & Mellish, 1996; Louwerse & Mitchell, 2003; Schiffrin, 1987). Conjunctions may be used by editors to effect a change in the coding of relationships between propositions included in either two or more clauses or sentences. Such change may be obtained by replacing an existing conjunctive item with a more appropriate one, or by relating two separate sentences to one another through the use of a conjunction. Editorial changes in conjunction thus have relevance in the finer understanding of discourse.

The class of embedding refers to cases in which the conjunction employed by the original writer has been deleted, or clauses or sentences are connected by other means than conjunction. The various editorial strategies for increasing and/or reducing explicitness are shown in Table 1.

# 3. The study

# 3.1. Data

The data consist of 16 documents which fall into two main groups analysed by using the following procedure. First, we looked at the non-native writers’ units of eight texts produced in English by Danish and Finnish writers, four texts from each group. These writers come from EAP settings; the Danish writers are employed by a university and the Finnish writers by an independent research centre. All writers minimally hold a master’s degree, and one has a doctoral degree. The writers produce fluent and idiomatic English with few grammatical errors. Second, we analysed the eight edited versions of the documents to see what changes the texts had undergone in the editing process. The editing of the texts took place in Dublin by native English speakers. All versions date from 2002 or 2003 and thus represent current usage.

The texts were written for the European Industrial Relations Observatory (EIRO), an organisation led by the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions which, in turn, is an agency set up by the European Council. EIRO is supervised by the European Union and member state governments, trade unions, employer organisations and the European Commission. EIRO collects its data from 20 national research centres or institutions and one EU research centre. The assigned task of EIRO is to ‘‘analyse and disseminate high-quality and up-to-date information on key developments in industrial relations in Europe. It aims primarily to serve the needs of national and European level organisations of the social partners, governmental organisations and EU institutions’’ (EIRO homepage, 2004).

EIRO publishes a wide range of material via its online service (EIROnline), including news and feature articles. An edited selection of documents appears in its bi-monthly bulletin EIRObserver. The edited documents included in the present study were extracted from this bulletin. They were available at the time of writing on the Internet (http://www.eiro.eurofound.eu.int/). The unedited versions were provided to us by the writers of the respective articles.

# 3.2. Method

We have adopted a descriptive method, which enables us to compare unedited and edited texts, and to identify the changes apparent in the edited texts using text linguistic, discursive or rhetorical concepts. We take a departure from the normal use of the devices associated with the cohesive quality of text (e.g. ellipsis and other deletive strategies), as well as changes involving referential items, repetition as an element of lexical cohesion, and conjunction (including the device of embedding). However, rather than establishing cohesive profiles of the selected texts, we attempt to explain the rhetorical consequences of the editorial changes to the cohesive devices identified.

In the ensuing analysis, only short passages of texts are quoted, although our observations are based on larger stretches of text. This means that we have been analysing the manifestations of the relevant phenomena in longer passages from the perspective of their textual context and not as isolated utterances. To give the reader an idea of the text entities, a sample text is provided in Appendix B.

# 3.3. Analysis

# 3.3.1. Ellipsis and other deletion

We will first look at examples in which the explicitness of the text has been reduced and the implicitness increased in order to intensify the cohesive force of the utterance. The intensification may have been achieved through various means, such as ellipting the referential or nominal item. Deletions frequently have an intensifying effect as well.

Example 1 displays a paratactic arrangement where the referential subject $i t$ , anaphorically referring to the subject of the first clause, has been ellipted. In this and the ensuing examples, the slot containing the ellipsis is marked with the symbol $\emptyset$ and the ellipted item is given either in brackets, or is mentioned separately in the text in which the example is explained. Furthermore, this and the ensuing examples are for the most part from the edited (E) versions, and only minimal reference is made to the unedited (U) texts. The Danish texts in the data are referred to with the symbol DK and the Finnish with FI.

Example 1. This agreement has been incorporated as a protocol on ‘‘Bringing more people into employment’’ to the collective agreement for the industrial sector, and $\emptyset$ [it] will come into force. . . (DK2)

There was already cohesion and implicitness in the use of the referential item $i t$ , but the edited version takes the implicitness a step further with the zero reference (to agreement). Similarly, in Example 2, there is cohesion with the referential item $i t$ , but the cohesive force of the utterance has been intensified by ellipting it in the adversative clause.

Example 2. The proposed legislation would make work permit procedures faster and more flexible but $\boldsymbol { \sigma }$ [it] does not respond to all the needs. . . (FI2)

In both of these examples, the cohesive force of the utterance has been intensified from reference to ellipsis. In other words, the implicitness of the texts has been increased and explicitness reduced.

Another method by which explicitness has been reduced through ellipsis is the deletion of a repeated item, as shown in Example 3. The ellipsis of a preposition, identical with one previously given, is a common cohesive device found in the edited versions. This is an example of an editorial policy in which an explicit unedited text has been rendered less explicit.

Example 3. It was delivered to the Finnish government, [to the] the Finnish parliament and its ‘‘grand committee’’, and [to the] Finnish members of the European Convention—the body charged with preparing for the next intergovernmental Conference, by proposing a new framework and structures for the Union, notably in the light of enlargement. (FI1)

The data contain a number of instances in which overt passages have been made more implicit through deletion. Examples 4 and 5 illustrate such cases.

Example 4. In addition [to this], it is. . . (FI2)

Example 5. The stated reasons [for this] are. . . (DK1)

The editing device occurring here is on the borderline between a cohesive method (ellipsis) and a primarily stylistic procedure (deletion), as there does not seem to be a clear syntactic slot remaining to be filled, which would be the case with a simple ellipsis. Nevertheless, the bottom line remains that the editor has increased the implicitness of the non-native writer’s text.

The foregoing examples point to changes in the rhetorical quality of the passages. Yet, the data also contained cases in which the changes made by the editors may have been motivated by stylistic preferences rather than by more subtle discourse strategies. Example 6 will serve to illustrate this difference.

Example 6. Most closed-shop agreements are found in these sectors because of the large number of unorganised employers [in these sectors]. (DK1E)

This situation is not much different from those portrayed in Example 7a and b below. The speculation that different editors may have their personal preferences cannot be avoided here.

# 3.3.2. Repetition and insertion

We now turn to examples displaying a somewhat opposite strategy by which the editors have added to the non-native writers’ texts. This includes the use of repetition to obtain either an increased or decreased effect.

Repetition is increased in Example 7a, and b by inserting a repetitive NP. The inserted elements in this and the ensuing examples are printed in italics.

Example 7a. The new law has also increased the number of members that UIFs are required to have. The number has been raised from. . . (DK3E)

Example 7b. In the new law there was also a change in the state-required number of members of unemployment funds. It was raised from. . . (DK3U)

Here the change is from the more cohesive referential item $I t$ to repeating the lexical item. While repetition increases lexical cohesion, it creates a shift towards more explicit discourse on the explicitness–implicitness scale.

A related issue is highlighted by Example 8. Here the reference to old, given information (the report) is made more explicit with the NP committee’s, a notion that had already been established in the text.

Example 8. The Danish Employers’ Confederation. . .was satisfied with the proposal drawn up for the new legislation, which follows most of the recommendations in the committee’s report. (DK1)

Similarly, explicitness is increased in Example 9. Here the editor has added a whole stretch of discourse thus supplying extra information to the uninitiated discourse community (i.e. the potential readership who will be unfamiliar with the situational context of EU developments and decision making processes).

Example 9. It was delivered to the Finnish government, the Finnish parliament and its ‘‘grand committee’’, and to the Finnish members of the European Convention— the body charged with preparing for the next intergovernmental Conference, by proposing a new framework and structures for the Union, notably in the light of enlargement. (FI1E)

Furthermore, the editors’ strategy of trying to ensure that the texts will not require implicit knowledge between the writers and readers is pinpointed in Example 10. This is an extract from a text about the consequences of the enlargement of the European Union in which the preceding passage deals with the possible influx of workers from the new member states. In the extracted example sentence, the native editor has added the acronym the EU. However, since the previous passage reads as follows: In connection with the enlargement of the European Union, there is planned to be. . ., it appears that, in the editors view, this establishment of the topic (of the European Union) does not carry as far as to the immediately subsequent passage, let alone to the rest of the text.

Example 10. When the EU’s enlargement towards the south took place. . . (DK1E)

Example 11 shows us that the added phrase of the report has been inserted to give a more exact indication of time, thus increasing the explicitness of the expression.

Example 11. LO strongly criticised the Minister, who had in advance of the report strongly expressed the view that. . . (DK1E)

A method of reducing explicitness through increased cohesion concerns the treatment of the NP, as in Example 12.

Example 12. The social partners have previously stated that the growing demand for labour in Finland should be met in the first place through domestic measures. They [The organisations] emphasise that. . . (FI2)

Here the lexical cohesion of the unedited version, achieved via near synonymy (social partners, organisations), has been replaced with cohesion through reference. This strategy is the opposite of that used in Example 7a and b, where it was changed into repetition of a noun phrase (the number).

Next, let us discuss a borderline case where we may claim that the changes made by the editor derive from stylistic rather than rhetorical preferences. In Example 13, the native Finnish writer has used the grammatically correct device of adjective in the role of a noun. This requires the writer to use the definite article the, which has the semantic role of coding old, given and defined information, as the grammatical name indicates.

Example 13. In 2002, the Ministry of Labour started a three-year experiment of using private ‘‘job hunters’’ to find work for [the] long-term unemployed people. (FI3)

The example shows a replacement of the adjectival noun used in the unedited version: the long-term unemployed. Here the editor, however, has restored the adjective in its modifying role and has added the noun people. The definiteness of the concept of ‘‘those who are unemployed’’ (the unemployed) becomes generic with the deletion of the definite article.

# 3.3.3. Reference-derived changes

We will now examine cases in which the unedited versions operate with referential items, but where such items have been changed to make them more explicit. The data show that editors occasionally replace a referential item with a noun phrase, thereby reducing the cohesive nature of the text in that passage but making the text more explicit. This is apparent in Example 14a and b, where the writer has produced a strong cohesive tie to a whole chunk of the preceding text with the anaphoric reference this. The editor has, however, reduced the cohesive intensity and changed this anaphoric reference into cataphoric by letting it modify, instead, the added noun phrase earlier situation. The editor has thus ensured that the reader knows exactly what this refers to.

Example 14a. However, this earlier situation has no comparison. . . (DK1E)

Example 14b. But this has no comparison. . . (DK1U)

In Example 15, the noun phrase foreigners has been replaced with demonstrative reference. This may be to avoid repetition, as the word foreigners already occurred in the previous sentence. Nevertheless, the edited text seems marginally less elegant and it appears that the original repetition of the noun would have been stylistically more adequate. This example is from the beginning of a paragraph in a section explaining work permit procedures in Finland.

Example 15. Several groups of foreigners are exempt from work permit procedures. These include: those [foreigners] with permanent residence permits, students in respect of part-time work and holiday jobs; refugees and people receiving residence permits due to their need for protection. (FI2).

Here the noun foreigners, occurring in the unedited version, was in better harmony with the subsequent list of nouns used in the same sentence to enumerate the types of people not requiring work permits, such as foreigners, students, refugees, etc.

The data contained several instances in which the editors were not satisfied with the non-native writers’ use of the definite article. The definite article possesses a certain referential quality as it points to old, given information. The first example illustrates the case in which the referential the has been changed into the even more explicit possessive its. This example is from the beginning of a section, which describes the reactions of the Danish Confederation of Labour Unions to a new law passed by the Danish government permitting cross-sector unemployment insurance funds. A lengthy passage, starting from the sub-heading, is quoted here for reference.

Example 16. The new law has also increased the number of members that UIFs are required to have. The number has been raised from 5000 to 10,000, with immediate effect for new funds and by 2007 for already established funds. LO states that this change will hit even some well-functioning UIFs with close relations to their specific sector. The law could force them to close down or merge by 2007, for no reason other than obeying the law. Immediate reactions: After the law passed in June, LO immediately tried to counter its effects by making a common response. Its [The] 17 member unions agreed that they would. . .of the agreement among the LO unions, as it will not adopt its new cross-sector status until March 2003, there is little doubt that STA has damaged the spirit of solidarity in LO. . . (DK3)

This is one of the instances in which the editors have made changes in the Danish writers’ use of the definite article. Likewise, the editors frequently changed the definite article into the demonstrative this, as Example 17 and Example 18 show.

Example 17. As a rule, a work permit must be applied for before entering in Finland. In this case, an employer or a ‘‘principal’’ starts the application process by asking for an opinion on the employment of foreign labour. This [The] so-called work permit opinion is issued. . . (FI2)

The foregoing example was from the Finnish data, but such examples are present in the Danish texts as well. Example 18 represents such a case.

Example 18. This unity, however, soon lost. . . (DK3)

Here, the unedited version contained an intertextual metaphor The ‘‘one for all— all for one’’ spirit however soon lost. . .(DK3). Even if we accept that such creativity is not desirable in the genre concerned, it still remains to be explained why the editor is not happy with The unity. . .

We would suggest that the demonstrative reference brings the item concerned closer to the reader and thereby adds explicitness, whereas the definite article in this context seems to convey a general truth about the topic in question (i.e. work permits). A somewhat opposite case is illustrated in Example 19, where the referential item these is replaced by such.

Example 19. It is regarded as essential to get such [these] people back into employment. . . (FI4)

In effect, the change means that the phrase has acquired a slightly more generic nature with such as opposed to what was achieved with the demonstrative these.

# 3.3.4. Conjunction and embedding

As mentioned earlier, a frequent method used for combining two sentences is to insert a conjunctive item (e.g. and, but, whereby), which enables structures that change the cohesive nature of a passage, as Example 20a and b shows.

Example 20a. The government submitted a new Aliens Act to parliament in December 2002, but there was insufficient time to discuss it before parliamentary elections took place in March 2003 and the proposal was dropped. (FI2E)

Example 20b. The government introduced a new Aliens Act to the Parliament in December 2002. The Parliament did not have time to discuss it before parliamentary elections took place in March 2003 and the proposal was dropped. (FI2U)

Here the conjunctive change has increased the level of explicitness through insertion of the explicit semantic code but. This narrows the interpretive field of the passage. A rather vague result has been achieved by adding the word then in Example 21.

Example 21. If the services provided are satisfactory, then members will. . . (DK1E)

Let us now examine a few cases in which sentences have been combined through other means than conjunction. Here, these means come under the umbrella term embedding. A typical example is available in Example 22.

Example 22. The aim is to find jobs for people who have been unemployed for longer than six months, or for a shorter period in the case of people with special difficulties in finding a job. . . The job hunters can be private firms, associations or individuals operating [who operate] as entrepreneurs. (FI3E)

The unedited version contained the following explicit relative clauses: . . .people who have and who operate. These have been replaced by a prepositional clause and embedded by use of the infinite form operating, respectively.

Example 23 shows another instance of embedding, where two sentences in the unedited version are combined into one.

Example 23. Each employment office can reach an agreement with several job hunters, who then conclude contracts with the unemployed people concerned, [These clients are] selected from candidates proposed by the employment office. (FI3)

Furthermore, embedding and prepositional phrases have also been used in the E data to combine sentences in the U data. Example 24a and b illustrates how extensive this type of editorial contraction may be.

Example 24a. However, this earlier situation is arguably not comparable with the EU’s eastern enlargement. The social and economic conditions in the southern Member States at the time of joining the EU were quite different from the present conditions in Central and Eastern Europe, where there is a extreme [sic] poverty and widespread unemployment. (DK1E)

Example 24b. The social conditions and the economy in the southern countries were quite different from the present conditions in the eastern countries. In the eastern countries there is a extreme [sic] poverty and widespread unemployment. (DK1U)

This example shows that the editorial change also affects the focus of the discourse. However, this relates to the political discourse policies which deserve a separate study.

# 4. Conclusion

On the basis of the present analysis, our first and immediate conclusion is that the changes made by the editors affect both the explicitness and implicitness of the texts. The analysis revealed a number of cases in which the text’s explicitness was reduced, correspondingly resulting in increased implicitness. In contrast, the analysis yielded examples in which the editors have added explicitness. However, there seems to be a certain tendency—if not a consistency—in how the increasing and decreasing explicitness is distributed. The increased explicitness concerns the overall continuity of the text (i.e. the macro-level flow and continuity of thought). The editors have thus sought to ensure that the discourse is framed with explicit, unequivocally coded cues. Therefore, increasing explicitness seems to be primarily a strategic phenomenon in discourse production.

In contrast, reduced explicitness seems to derive from micro-level and structural concerns rather than more subtle rhetorical considerations. The native editors have tolerated greater implicitness on the micro-level than assumed by the non-native writers. In short, the non-native writers seem to be pursuing explicitness through micro-level devices, while the editors tend to reduce explicitness on this level and correspondingly increase it on the more global level. Thus, explicitness is not a comprehensive strategy that can be applied uniformly or indiscriminately throughout the text. Rather, there is variation in how much explicitness is required and how little explicitness is tolerated, and this variation is related to the stretch of discourse under focus.

The analysis along the parameters employed in this study did not indicate that there would be noteworthy differences in how the Danish and Finnish writers’ texts were modified. Such findings are in agreement with our previous work in which we studied cultural variation in contextualization (Jorgensen & Yli-Jokipii, in press). In this study, we found that both Danish and Finnish EAP writers had adopted a reader-responsible strategy (Hinds, 1987). This means that once they had established the contextual framework at the beginning of the text, they did not repeat or return to it to the extent that the editors expected. This finding contrasts with the conclusions made in connection with some previous research. For example, Ventola and Mauranen (1990) and Mauranen (1993) attribute several of the discrepancies between differences in Finnish and English academic writing to the different nature of these languages.

Furthermore, Ventola and Mauranen’s Finnish texts were written by authors whose English skills were markedly inferior to those of the writers in the present study. It is therefore not surprising that Ventola and Mauranen point to differences in the reference system and the use of the definite article in coding given information. They therefore attribute the problems encountered by Finnish writers to the fact that the Finnish language is different from Germanic languages like English, in that it lacks the article system (the, a, an) for coding old, given information, and new information.

Since Danish belongs to the Germanic language group, it would be expected that in the present study the reference system of the Danish writers’ texts, especially the use of the and that would not be liable to change. Yet, these texts were subjected to similar editorial changes; the qualities that Ventola and Mauranen assign specifically to Finnish writers, such as the use of the, are shared by Danes as well. Still, the evidence does not undermine the fact that the Danes and the Finns have problems in the textual use of the referential the. Finns may have problems with surface-level coding of the given-new relationship, but when it comes to the textual, referential use of the, Danes and Finns seem to be making many of the same choices. Thus, the present study does not support the hypothesis based on the earlier reports that specific text-structuring problems can be ascribed to ingrained linguistic idiosyncrasies of Finnish academic writers.

The fact remains, however, that both the Danish and Finnish writers offered more explicitness in their texts than the native editors were prepared to accept. In other words, it is a textual quality which is not ascribable to Finnish writers only. In search of an explanation, we suggest that Finnish writers receive thorough and repetitive instructions on cultural differences between Finnish and Anglo-American writing strategies, something to which they have been exposed since the early 1990s—possibly because of the findings on cultural differences discovered by Crismore, Markkanen, and Steffensen (1993) in American and Finnish university students’ EAP writing, and because of the wide attention that Ventola and Mauranen’s (1990, 1992) work received among applied linguists and writing professionals (see also Mauranen, 1993). Ventola and Mauranen’s studies have also received much international attention among writing scholars because of their focus on academic texts and because their research has identified useful linguistic devices with a potential for explaining how texts are both produced and interpreted in different linguistic and rhetorical environments (see also Ventola & Mauranen, 1996). Moreover, within the present scenario, we cannot exclude the possibility that the non-native writers have decided to play it safe by using overt nouns and repetition and by coding their propositional relationships with overt conjunction. In other words, they may have deliberately sought to avoid the risk of being poorly understood or even misunderstood by their pan-European readership.

Finally, this study seems to indicate that the coding of explicitness and implicitness is neither a one-dimensional nor a single-method procedure. Rather, effective writing procedures rely on the message producers’ understanding of the complex interplay between textual, rhetorical and structural requirements of particular professional genres in varying cross-cultural settings. In the European context of this study, it requires subtle editorial gate-keeping to determine not only the right amount of explicitness, but also the appropriate degree of implicitness in order to effectively reach and inform a designated audience with very different needs and expectations. To be successful, writers and editors of academic journalese must therefore show an ability to strike the right balance between the discursive and lexico-grammatical devices at their disposal.

Disappointing results for ‘‘job hunter’’ experiment. Since 2002, the Finnish Ministry of Labour has been running a three-year experiment of using private ‘‘job hunters’’ to find work for long-term unemployed people. By mid-2003, the results have been very modest compared with the targets and the experiment might be ended before its official term.

In 2002, the Ministry of Labour started a three-year experiment of using private ‘‘job hunters’’ to find work for long-term unemployed people. The experiment has been conducted in employment offices in the largest cities. The aim is to find jobs for people who have been unemployed for longer than six months, or for a shorter period in the case of people with special difficulties in finding a job—e.g. owing to age or disability. The job hunters can be private firms, associations or individuals operating as entrepreneurs. Agreements to provide such services are reached between the employment offices and the job hunters after a competitive tender process, in the same way as in any other public procurement. Each employment office can reach an agreement with several job hunters, who then conclude contracts with the unemployed people concerned, selected from candidates proposed by the employment office. The client and the job hunter sign a three-month contract, which can be renewed for another three months. The job hunters are paid if they find the job seeker a non-subsidised private sector job for at least six months. The job can be full time or part time, but the working time must be at least $7 5 \%$ of the normal.

The experiment has a budget of 4 12 million, which could be enough to find thousands of jobs. However, so far the experiences have not been very encouraging. During 2002, the first year of operation, there were a total of 18 job hunters who managed to find jobs for 37 unemployed people. During the first half of 2003, there have been only 11 job hunters, who have found jobs for six people. There is a danger that if the results continue to be so disappointing the experiment may be finished before its official deadline.
