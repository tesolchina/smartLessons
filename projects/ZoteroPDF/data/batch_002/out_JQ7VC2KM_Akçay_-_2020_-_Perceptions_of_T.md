In the current study, perceptions of Turkish EFL instructors and their students on native and non-native accents of English and English as a lingua franca (ELF) were explored. Moreover, how the EFL instructors and students see the position and ownership of English as a native language and as a lingua franca all over the world and their own use of ELF was also investigated. The study was conducted with 78 non-native English instructors and 214 English prep school students at a state university. The data were collected over a six-week period via an online survey that consisted of four sections. Descriptive and inferential statistics were utilized in the analysis. The results indicated that both the instructors and students were aware of ELF on a theoretical level, yet had some hesitations about the practical implications of it. The results also showed that participants liked the native accents (i.e. British, American) more than the non-native ones. Moreover, the speakers of the native accents were associated with characteristics that are more positive. Both the instructors and students had a positive attitude towards English language and were aware of its instrumental and widespread value, but regarded the native speakers as the owner of the language.

Key words: ELF, native and non-native accents, ownership of language

Bu çalışmada, yükseköğretim düzeyinde İngilizceyi yabancı dil olarak öğreten öğretim görevlileri ile öğrencilerinin İngilizce ana dil aksanları ve ana dil olmayan aksanları ile İngilizcenin ortak dil olarak kullanımı hakkındaki algıları araştırılmıştır. Çalışmada aynı zamanda öğretim görevlisi ve öğrencilerin İngilizceye dair inançlarına, dünyadaki ortak dil olarak konumuna ve İngiliz dilinin kime ait olduğuna dair görüşlerine de odaklanılmıştır. Çalışma, bir devlet üniversitesinde anadili İngilizce olmayan 78 öğretim görevlisi ve 214 İngilizce hazırlık okulu öğrencisi ile yürütülmüştür. Veriler, dört bölümden oluşan çevrimiçi bir anket aracılığıyla altı haftalık bir süre zarfında toplanmıştır. Analizde tanımlayıcı ve çıkarımsal istatistikler kullanılmıştır. Sonuçlar hem öğretim görevlisi hem de öğrencilerin teorik düzeyde İngilizcenin ortak dil olarak kullanımından haberdar olduklarını, ancak bunun pratik sonuçları hakkında bazı tereddütleri olduğunu ortaya koymuştur. Sonuçlar ayrıca katılımcıların İngilizce ana dil aksanları (İngiliz, Amerikan) ana dil aksanı olmayanlardan daha fazla beğendiklerini göstermiştir. Ayrıca, ana dil aksanların konuşmacıları daha olumlu olan özellikler ile ilişkilendirilmiştir. Hem öğretim görevlisi hem de öğrenciler İngilizceye karşı olumlu bir tutum sergilemişlerdir ve İngilizcenin araçsal ve yaygın değerinin farkındadırlar, ancak ana dili İngilizce olanları dilin sahibi olarak değerlendirmişlerdir. Anahtar kelimeler: Ortak dil olarak İngilizce, ana dil aksanları, ana dil olmayan aksanlar

# CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

# Introduction

The term lingua franca, which can be defined as a common language to maintain communication among people whose first languages are different, is not new and has been used in different contexts for a long time. Although several different languages may well have performed as lingua francas throughout history, it is mainly English, which has functioned as a worldwide lingua franca since the late 16th century as a result of the political and social developments taking place in the world. (Jenkins, Cogo, & Dewey, 2011). Yet, it took some time for the term English as a lingua franca (ELF) to be discussed in academia until the 1980s and at the beginning of the new millennium, two important pieces of study by Jenkins (2000) and Seidlhofer (2001) have given the way to further popularity and research on part of the term ELF. Moreover, the rapid globalization process taking place in every part of the world has promoted the significance of teaching, learning and using English for people from various countries and thus made ELF an important issue of research. Currently, ELF is an area of study, which works on a variety of subjects related to English using, teaching and learning including linguistics, sociolinguistics and cultural studies (Bayyurt, 2006).

ELF research, especially in its beginning times, tended to focus on different issues of linguistics, especially on form and function. Yet, in time ELF researchers have started to pay attention to certain aspects of pragmatics and meaning as well (Cogo & Dewey, 2006). Furthermore, with ELF being used in many different contexts with all its diversity and variability, there has arisen a need to

reconceptualize ELF (Jenkins, 2015) and gain a better insight about what people’s perceptions related to the use of ELF, ownership of language and diversity are. This study aims to explore Turkish EFL (English as a foreign language) instructors’ and students’ perceptions on English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) and native and nonnative accents of English. The study also aims to find out how the EFL instructors and students see the position and ownership of English as a native language and as a lingua franca all over the world and their own use of ELF.

# Background of the Study

The term ELF can be defined as English language used to communicate by speakers who have various native languages or mother tongues (Jenkins, 2009). In a similar vein, Seidlhofer (2011) has come up with the description of the term ELF as “any use of English among speakers of different first languages for whom English is the communicative medium of choice, and often the only option” (p. 7). After much academic discussion on the position of native speakers and the characteristics peculiar to ELF, more recently, Mortensen (2013) has suggested a simpler definition as “the use of English in a lingua franca language scenario” (p. 36).

From the earliest times of ELF research until recent times, various studies with different linguistic approaches have been conducted (e.g. Mauranen, 2012; Seidlhofer, 2004, 2011). Moreover, studies focusing on the cultural and personal interpretation of ELF and its pedagogic indications on language instruction and learning have been common (e.g. Canagarajah, 2006; Jenkins, 2007). The studies by Firth (1996) and House (1999) can be considered as two of the earliest studies in the field. Firth’s (1996) study investigated communication patterns among non-native speakers (NNS) of English. The aim of this study was to assert that in spite of the deviations and differences in their use of the language compared to the use of native speakers, NNS could communicate effectively and meaning could be conveyed in their conversations. Yet, in contemporary understanding, ELF is not evaluated with reference to the norms of the native speakers, but in its own terms and right. Similarly, as the study by House (1999) was based on a classroom simulation, the interactions taking place were not a part of the naturally occurring data, which has been the case for later ELF research.

With the new millennium, academic interest in ELF research expanded. This was mainly after the empirical study of Jenkins (2000) on ELF pronunciation. This study was significant in terms of identifying several functional and formal characteristics of ELF and relating to the differences in pronunciation. Short after this, Seidlhofer (2001) made it clear that there was a gap in literature as to the position of accepted native norms in the definition and use of ELF, adding that whether or not those native norms should be regarded as the ultimate point for ELF speakers was an essential question.

It can be maintained that patterns of ELF communication are mainly produced by speakers of English who are non-native (Sung, 2015), but the positon of native speakers in the definition of ELF has also been a question in the academia. Indeed, Jenkins (2015) reconceptualized the term as English as a Multilingua Franca by stating, “ELF is a multilingual practice, and research should start from this premise and explore how ELF’s multilingualism is enacted in different kinds of interactions” (p. 63). In a similar vein, Cogo (2015) also maintained that speakers in ELF interactions could well utilize their own “plurilingual resources to flexibly construct their common repertoire in accordance with the needs of their community and the circumstances of the interaction” (p. 3). Furthermore, in the contemporary understanding, the contexts in which ELF is used are active, multilingual, fluid and international. Accordingly, the accent inclinations and ELF-identity relationship of the speakers have been looked into by many scholars as well (e.g. Flowerdew & Wang, 2015; McKenzie, 2010; Timmis, 2002).

# Statement of the Problem

Although English had functioned as a lingua franca in certain places worldwide since the 16th century, it was not until the 1980s that the term ELF in its contemporary understanding was established (Hüllen, 1982). Yet, except for a few studies and independent academic discussion in the academic field (e.g. Firth & Wagner 1997; House 1999), there was not a considerable and consistent interest in the term ELF.

At the beginning of the new era, the empirical study of Jenkins (2000) and an important publication by Seidlhofer (2001) on ELF marked the beginning of the major academic interest and popularity for the term. Since then, there has been a growing attention in ELF and many researchers have investigated theoretical and instructional points related to the term (e.g.; Cogo & Dewey, 2012; Seidlhofer, 2011).

Being an issue to be questioned in English Language Teaching (ELT) as well, there have been a number of studies in the field of ELT on the different features of ELF for teachers and students (e.g. Cogo, 2010; Kaur, 2014; Sifakis & Sougari, 2005). Moreover, the need to raise awareness about ELF on part of the teachers and students has been pointed out. Yet, the ownership of language and non-native teachers and students’ attitudes towards ELF communication and different accents have been an area, which is under investigated with few studies conducted so far (e.g. Kaur, 2014; Ur, 2010).

The term ELF has been investigated with regard to the recognition it has gained up to now in the academia and its common position against the accepted standard native speaker norms as well. Jenkins (2004) maintained that as English language teachers were mainly exposed to the native norms in their own educational background, they generally tended to prefer to sound like the natives and teach the language with those standard norms. In a similar vein, Kirkpatrick (2006) came up with reasons as to why ELF could not be easily accepted as an alternative to English used by native speakers. In fact, Christiansen (2017) stated “Traditional standards and more recent NES-norm oriented models survive in major part because of the prestige associated with them, notwithstanding the fact that, in the literature, the NES is left as a very general concept and little distinction is made between NESs of standard and non-standard varieties.” (p. 60).

Currently, achieving intelligibility and thus maintaining communication instead of the attainment of native-like accent or pronunciation (Jenkins, 2000) makes investigating whether or not accent is of value for non-native learners or teachers of English and what has a role in ELF interactions in terms of accent preference and identity formations. Some empirical studies conducted so far have indicated the relationship between ELF interactions and identity construction of the speakers. This approach was opposed to the conception of ELF being neutral in terms of culture and identity (Baker, 2015; Kalocsai, 2013). Yet, to the knowledge of the researcher, comparably less is known about the accent preferences of ELF speakers and their inclinations about the ownership of language and identity construction.

In Turkey, research on ELF has mainly focused on the attitudes of English teachers (prospective or in-service) on ELF, its pedagogy and classroom practices (Bayyurt, 2006; Bayyurt & Erçetin, 2009; İnceçay & Akyel, 2014). Few studies have been conducted regarding the attitudes of students towards ELF. Kaypak (2012) investigated the attitudes of Turkish Erasmus students towards ELF by making use of journals and questionnaires and maintained that the students’ reactions to ELF communication and use were positive, yet they recognized the importance of intelligibility as well.

The native speaker model and accent varieties have also been explored in Turkish context. Coşkun (2011) investigated accent preferences and attitudes of senior English language teaching department students towards English as an international language (EIL) and ELF. With the results of this study, it was found that although prospective English language teachers accepted that the term ELF and different varieties existed, their perception of ideal pronunciation for a language teacher was still a standard native speaker one and non-native varieties were not acknowledged for classroom teaching practices. In a similar vein, Alptekin (2002) challenged the ideally alleged native-speaker standards and asserted that these standards were not realistic and feasible when the fluid and multicultural nature of ELF or EIL was taken into consideration. Another study aiming to investigate the perspectives of non-native teachers towards ELF and their classroom practices was conducted by Soruç (2015), and it was concluded that non-native teachers participating in the study preferred native speaker norms to use and teach instead of ELF. Up to the present, the studies conducted in the field of ELF have taken little notice of what kind of attitudes non-native English language instructors and students hold towards ELF, native and non-native accents, ownership of language and identity. In this respect, the beliefs and attitudes of non-native instructors and

students on these issues should be re-examined in the light of a more ELF-conscious approach.

# Research Questions

This research study seeks to answer the following research questions:

1. What are the perceptions of English language instructors towards ELF and to what extent are they aware of the concept of ELF?

2. What are the perceptions of students towards ELF and to what extent are they aware of the concept of ELF?

3. Who do English language instructors consider the owner of the English language?

4. Who do the students consider the owner of the English language?

5. What beliefs about and attitudes towards native and non-native accents of English (i.e. American English, British English, Spanish English, and Turkish English) do English language instructors and students have?

6. Do the attitudes of English instructors towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits differ significantly based on their perceptions and awareness of ELF?

7. Do the students’ attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits differ significantly based on their perceptions and awareness of ELF?

8. Do beliefs and attitudes towards different English accents differ significantly depending on being an English instructor or student?

9. Is there any statistically significant difference between English instructors and students in terms of the variables below? i) emotional beliefs about English ii) functional beliefs about English iii) attitudes towards English pronunciation iv) beliefs about the speaker’s own competence v) attitudes towards ELF vi) attitudes towards ELF communication vii) the speaker’s identity viii) language anxiety

# Significance of the Study

This study may contribute to answer the question of how the English language speakers in a context where English is taught and learned as a foreign language perceive the native speaker norms and ELF communication. As the world is being globalized more and more every day, a better understanding of ELF and non-native speakers’ attitude towards different accent varieties may contribute to the identity-related and psycholinguistic findings in the field and may trigger more indepth research. Moreover, the implications of the study may help scholars and teachers better understand how the students feel about learning and using English in the fluid, multicultural contemporary world and thus arrange the teaching process as a whole accordingly.

At the pedagogical and local level, the findings of this study can be beneficial both for the teachers as the main practitioners in their classroom and for the other

stakeholders planning, implementing and designing curriculum in Turkey. Moreover, as the study was conducted with both the instructors and students at the tertiary level, the findings may well reveal how the two parties experiencing the process in an English a foreign language (EFL) environment see ELF and what kind of differences-if any- there are. Such kind of an understanding may help revisit and revise the current language instruction and learning practices. In addition, as Turkey is a country where English is taught as a foreign language and students are generally exposed to English only in the classroom, the results of this study may show if there is a need to include diverse varieties in terms of content and pronunciation to cater for the students’ needs for intercultural communication in the contemporary world.

# CHAPTER 2: REVIEW OF LITERATURE

# Introduction

This chapter aims to review the previous literature linked with this research study. In this chapter, first, English as a lingua franca (ELF) will be presented along with different interpretations theorized by various scholars and a comparative analysis will be provided. Then some important related terms, which should be differentiated from ELF, will be explored. Moreover both theoretical and empirical studies in the related literature will be covered in detail.

# English as a Lingua Franca (ELF)

In Cambridge online dictionary, the term lingua franca is described as “a language used for communication between groups of people who speak different languages” (“lingua franca,” n. d.). It ought to be mentioned that the appearance of a lingua franca is not a phenomenon of the 21st century. Recognition of the term dates back to 17th century and formation of different lingua francas was also common in some certain situations because of political or social changes (Sankoff, 2002).

In our contemporary society, the world has witnessed the emergence of English as a lingua franca all over the world in various settings. This mostly stems from the fact that within time and with the results of the contemporary developments, there has arisen a need for a contact language among people with diverse linguistic, geographical and cultural backgrounds. Thus, this need brought about the establishment of English as a lingua franca.

In direct accordance with the interconnectedness in modern life and highly globalized world conditions, when the “multiplicity of voices” (House, 2002, p. 244) included in ELF is taken into consideration, the role of English is far from being

defined as a common contact language. Hence, many researchers have come up with various definitions for the term ELF (e.g. House, 2002; Jenkins, 2007, 2009; Seidlhofer, 2011). To be able to have a more thorough insight about the term and perceive how scholars approach ELF, it may be insightful to compare different definitions.

Firth (1996) defined ELF as “a ‘contact language’ between persons who share neither a common native tongue nor a common (national) culture, and for whom English is the chosen foreign language of communication” (p. 240). In this definition, the speakers whose native language was English were not included and in line with the common understanding, the standards of native speakers were regarded as the appropriate patterns for ELF speakers. However, in time, scholars including House (2003) and Jenkins (2007) have clearly asserted that ELF is all about communication, rather than being a form of language to be compared with native speaker productions. Seidlhofer (2004) states, “ELF has taken on a life of its own, independent to a considerable degree of the norms established by its native speakers.” (p. 212). This mainly stems from the fact that ELF interactions most of the time occur in volatile environments and the patterns used in ELF communication are generally formed or produced by ELF users with different national and linguistic backgrounds (Cogo & Jenkins, 2010). Furthermore, Jenkins (2015) also states that even if English native speakers are involved in ELF interactions, they are not the ones who establish the linguistic patterns used. Thus, in ELF communication, multilingual ELF speakers make use of their ability in utilizing the language as effectively as possible and this is considered a lot more influential than the capacity to comply with the standard norms of native language (Jenkins, 2007; Seidlhofer, 2011).

In literature, ELF has also been defined and characterized with regard to its differences from and similarities to other terms. This has mostly stemmed from the fact that these terms are related and needs to be utilized together. Hence, to be able to have a complete knowledge of the term ELF, it is also critical to look into some important terms that ELF has been related with in the literature and shed light on the differences and similarities among these terms.

# Theoretical Background: Kachru’s Three Concentric Circles of English

Braj Kachru is regarded as one of the pathfinders in the field of linguistics and he outlined the spread and position of English in the world in his wellestablished three concentric circles of English model (Kachru, 1985). According to Kachru (1985), the countries or communities using English all over the world may be divided into three main groups or circles. Hence, these three main circles are the inner circle, the outer circle and the expanding circle (see Figure 1).

![](img/228524b906355e31514076d8fc5ab8c47d7b2f4c572aa1c501d02ab81ace8fc0.jpg)

Figure 1. Kachru’s three circles of English model. From “English Next” (p. 110), by D. Graddol, 2006, London: British Council. Copyright 2006 by British Council. Reprinted with permission.

The inner circle refers to communities or contexts in which English is generally the native or first language, such as the UK, the USA or Australia. Kachru (1990) also defines these as “norm providers” (p. 14) representing the traditionally ideal native speaker norms, which are accepted as accurate and appropriate.

The outer circle communities are the ones where English is generally the official second and often the standard institutional language although it is not the mother tongue. India, Singapore or Malaysia are the examples of these countries. In these communities, people are often able to utilize English effectively and fluently in their daily conversations. Kachru (1990) defines this group of speakers as “norm developers” (p. 16) as they often establish new varieties of their own.

Lastly, the expanding circle refers to the contexts where English language is not the mother or the second official language. On the contrary, in expanding circle countries such as Russia, Japan or Turkey, English is generally taught, learned and spoken as a total foreign language. Again, according to Kachru (1990) the speakers in this group are “norm-dependent” (p. 17) as the standard native norms are generally regarded being the ultimate point to be reached.

When the current position and worldwide use of English language is considered, it can be concluded that new forms of usage and varieties have emerged. Moreover, the speakers in the outer and expanding circle countries have already outnumbered the inner circle native speakers. The speakers in outer and expanding circle communities possess their own pragmatic patterns, historical and literary heritages and norms that are used in communication. Thus, ELF and other related terms need to be looked into in detail to shed more light on English teaching, learning and communication process as a whole.

# ELF and World Englishes (WE)

The term World Englishes (WE) is regarded as a general term for numerous varieties of English all over the world. Kachru (1985) came up with the World

Englishes model to categorize the different varieties of English with the wellestablished three concentric circles model.

For a better understanding, it is essential to point out the line of difference between the “native” and “nativised” varieties of English clarified in literature (Kirkpatrick, 2007, p. 5). Kirkpatrick (2007) explained nativised varieties as the more recently emerged varieties, which came into existence in the surroundings where English was not an original language and thus was shaped by the regional linguistic and cultural effects. In this sense, while the British or American English is a native variety, World Englishes are local and nativised varieties of English (Kirkpatrick, 2007).

When “World Englishes” as a term is relevant to nativised varieties of English, the prevalent differences between World Englishes and ELF need to be investigated. First, as Kirkpatrick (2011) points out, the biggest difference between the term World Englishes and ELF is that in ELF the basic concern is over communication while World Englishes is more about reflecting identity and regional cultures. Next, the kind of vocabulary used in ELF and WE are different from each other. Culturally specific vocabulary and idiomatic expressions are commonly used in World Englishes whereas in ELF they are relatively limited.

Apart from the differences, ELF and World Englishes have also some shared characteristics. Pakir (2009) asserts that World Englishes and ELF have similar principles such as “emphasizing the pluricentricity of English, seeking variety recognition, accepting that languages change and adapts itself to new environments, and observing the discourse strategies of English-knowing bilinguals” (p. 233). Hence, creativity and flexibility of the language can be regarded as the common characteristics of ELF and World Englishes.

# ELF and English as a Foreign Language (EFL)

English as a Foreign Language (EFL) is another important term that should be differentiated. Jenkins (2006) asserts that for ELF native speaker productions are not regarded as the benchmark to be met and this makes ELF tolerant to the alterations of native or ideal forms. Indeed, because of the multinational and multicultural nature of ELF, those possible changes in the use of language are regarded as sources of variety in ELF. However, in EFL, the use of language is mainly based on the ideal native standards, and EFL is not lenient with differences. This is mainly because in EFL, both the learners and teachers conform to the assumption that achieving the proficiency of native-like model is the desired outcome (Jenkins, 2006).

When all the aforementioned are taken into consideration, a conceptual distinction can be made between EFL and ELF notions. In ELF, as the main goal is communication, successful use of skills and strategies is emphasized. However, in EFL, native-like competence and accuracy is desired. Within this understanding, any deviations from the desired native norms are explained by using the interference and fossilization metaphor indicating that native-like competency could not be achieved. On the contrary, ELF is all about communication since spekaers with various languages and ethnological roots contact both with the language and other people, and naturally, change comes about. Moreover, as native-like proficiency is not the ultimate aim in ELF, different usages from the standard native speaker forms are regarded as sources of difference or bilingual resources rather than deficits stemming from the gaps in linguistic knowledge.

# ELF and English as a Native Language (ENL)

Jenkins (2009) describes English as a Native Language (ENL) as “the language of those born and raised in one of the countries where English is historically the first language to be spoken” (p. 15). Moreover, ENL can also be defined with reference to the inner circle (Kachru, 1985) category, thus representing the norm providers for the linguistic and cultural standard of English. Yet, the word native is not and cannot be used to indicate a single standard variety (Jenkins, 2009). As different geographical territories are included, ENL refers to different features in different districts (e.g., the American, the British etc.), or there may even be certain differences within the same district.

Unlike ENL, in defining ELF, geographical location is not an issue to be considered, as ELF can be temporary or even virtual when the context where the language is actively used is regarded (Cogo, 2012). Moreover, it is an undeniable fact that terms such as native and nonnative are also open to discussion in our highly globalized world. For instance, Jenkins (2009) asserted “when English is used as an international lingua franca among Expanding Circle speakers, then these speakers ‘own’ their lingua franca English, or ELF, and it therefore makes no sense to describe them as ‘non-native’ English speakers” (p.87).

# ELF and English as a Second Language (ESL)

When it comes to differentiate between ELF and ESL, the paradigm put forward by Kachru (1985, 1990) can shed more light on the distinction. In accordance with this paradigm, while ESL is generally evaluated with regard to the outer circle where English is the second language both in formal education and social life, ELF can be included under the expanding and sometimes outer circles with no certain boundaries. Furthermore, in the contemporary context, ELF does not even

need to be evaluated according to a geographic position or a specific location. The usage of ELF can well be virtual and provisional according to the context in which it is used (Cogo, 2012).

It is important to keep in mind that the number of English language learners and speakers increases every day, specifically in the expanding circle contexts, and English language is used in fluid and volatile environments. Accordingly, Jenkins (2006) presented an alternative view on the concept of ELF, by making it clear that ELF should be investigated in its own scope and terms, especially in Second Language Acquisition (SLA) research, rather than being compared to EFL, ENL or ESL.

# The Characteristics of ELF

As Cogo (2009) maintained ELF should be considered as a language variety that is enhanced with the “the multilingual and multicultural repertoire” (p. 270) it embodies. In accordance with this, Jenkins (2009) outlined the principal features of ELF as follows:

ELF should not be considered as a substitute to EFL. The speakers’ preferences and requirements play a role in making it an alternative. ELF mainly serves the function of conversation for people who do not have the shared native language/L1.   
ELF makes room for linguistically innovative usages shared by most of the ELF speakers.   
In terms of pragmatics, code switching and accommodation are commonly used strategies to maintain communication in a variety of contexts.

When it comes to pragmatics, Seidlhofer (2004) also put forward some general characteristics summarized below:

Misunderstandings are not very common in ELF communication. Contrary to the general perception, L1 interference is infrequent. ELF speakers make use of the assumption of “let-it-pass” defined by Firth (1996).

Hence, when the general characteristics of ELF given above are examined, it can be maintained that the main function of ELF is communication and speakers with different native languages and backgrounds can make use of some common strategies to maintain the dialogue.

# Lexico-Grammatical Characteristics of ELF

To be able to define and understand ELF in a more detailed and reliable way, Seidlhofer initiated the Vienna-Oxford International Corpus of English (VOICE). Based on the research studies using the not yet complete corpus data, Seidlhofer (2004) listed the common lexico-grammatical errors salient in ELF as follows:

Dropping the third person present tense –s,   
Confusing the relative pronouns who and which,   
Omitting definite and indefinite articles where they are obligatory in   
ENL, and inserting them where the do not occur in ENL,   
Failing to use correct forms in tag questions (e.g., isn’t it? or no?   
instead of shouldn’t they?),   
Inserting redundant prepositions, as in We have to study about.,   
Overusing certain verbs of high semantic generality, such as do, have,   
make, put, take,   
Replacing infinitive-constructions with that-clauses, as in I want that,

Overdoing explicitness (e.g. black color rather than just black) (p. 220)

# Attitudes towards ELF and ELF Communication

Upon the introduction and description of ELF and its common features, there arouse a need to explore the attitudes towards ELF and ELF communication. When the research in the field is examined, it can be seen that the term has not always been met with a positive stance and in literature, it has even been labelled as “lingua frankensteina” (Philipson, 2009). Some researchers also noted that the existence of such a term was empowering the inequality between native and non-native speakers (Llurda, 2015; Philipson, 2007). Negative approaches towards ELF could have also been the result of the lack of a clear-cut definition and standards in spite of the efforts to provide a comprehensive description.

On the contrary, there have been several descriptive and empirical studies refuting the negative comments. Early in the 21st century, House (2003) made a clear distinction by differentiating the “‘languages for communication’ and ‘languages for identification.’” (p. 556). Such a distinction once again confirmed that ELF was under the category of languages for communication. House (2003) also asserted that ELF did not have the aim to take the place of any language- local or national- because of its very nature, including any group of speakers regardless of their national or linguistic groundings.

As an expected result of the global world conditions and ELF being used in various contexts, several researchers investigated attitudes towards ELF and ELF usage in international and intercultural contexts (e.g. Jenkins, 2007; Kalocsai, 2013; Peckham, Kalocsai, Kovacs, & Sherman,2012). In the U.K., Cogo (2010) conducted a research study to look into the predilections of ELF speakers who have different native languages and revealed that the ideal correct usages of native speaker model were not the aim of the participants. Instead, their major concern was over maintaining communication in an effective way and they held positive attitudes towards ELF. In their large-scale study, Young and Walsh (2010) explored the attitudes of teachers coming from different countries in the world (e.g., Asia, Africa, and Europe) towards ELF. The results of this study indicated that although the teachers were positive towards ELF or different varieties because of the pragmatic benefits they provide, they still stated their need as a language teacher to have a standard correct form, which was somehow contradicting with the nature of ELF.

In Turkey, research on the perceptions or beliefs about ELF and ELF communication has mainly focused on teachers, teaching practices and pedagogical implications. Bayyurt (2006), in her study, reported that the teachers held positive attitudes towards ELF and they agreed to the integration of ELF within the curriculum. On the contrary, Coşkun (2011) investigated the preferences of preservice EFL teachers in pronunciation teaching with ELF understanding and found that although the participants were aware of ELF to some extent, they still considered native speaker norms, not ELF usages, as the appropriate content for their teaching. In a similar vein, İnceçay and Akyel (2014) explored EFL teachers’ perceptions on ELF. The findings of the study revealed that although the teachers were tolerant towards ELF productions of the students, they did not approve of using ELF in their teaching. In a more recent study looking into the attitudes of pre-service language teachers towards ELF, Biricik-Deniz, Özkan, and Bayyurt (2016) noted that the majority of the participants were against the idea of the integration of ELF in curriculum and classroom teaching. It can be concluded that these results may have stemmed from the fact that ELF was not generally included in teacher education curriculum.

Furthermore, Sağlık-Okur (2016) explored the inclinations of EFL teachers, Turkish EFL students and international students towards ELF. The obtained results showed that while Turkish EFL students considered native speaker norms and accents as desirable for themselves, for international students native speaker standard was not the benchmark to be able use the language well. The teachers participated in the study stated that they would like to integrate ELF into their teaching, yet they favored native speaker standards especially in writing. The results may again indicate that in Turkish context although the teachers and students had positive stances towards ELF, they favored native speaker norms, not ELF as being more desirable.

# ELF and Identity

The prevalent use of ELF has also brought about the need to investigate how ELF speakers disclose their identities through language in ELF communication. Norton (1997) described identity as “how people understand their relationship to the world, how that relationship is constructed across time and space, and how people understand their possibilities for the future” (p. 408). Hence, in its broadest sense, identity is about the perception of a person about his/her own self, or as Edwards (2009) put forward it is the definition of the self by the society or persons. One important feature of identity is related to the language identity of a person. Ushioda and Dörnyei (2009) maintained, “When learners invest in a language, they do so with the understanding that they will acquire a wider range of symbolic and material resources, which will enhance their cultural capital, their identity and their desires for the future.” (p. 4). Thus, a speaker’s affiliation with a certain language or even a dialect is included in language identity.

For any language speaker, accent is mainly considered to constitute a significant part of the speaker’s identity (Jenkins, 2000). In accordance with this, Dalton and Seidlhofer (1994) maintained that pronunciation seemed to make up much of the self-representation for L2 speakers. In addition, L2 speakers sometimes even chose to maintain their own accents on purpose instead of a native or standard one as a reflection of their identity. With the extensive use of ELF in the current global context, a variety of native and non-native accents have come out and Jenkins (2000) asserted that non-native is a term, which is generally identified with negative implications, and the difference between native and non-native seems to indicate an unequal relationship. To be able to confront this unequal relationship, ELF researchers point out that L2 speakers and their identities ought to be re-established as valid speakers or users of ELF, holding their own right instead of the image of deficient speakers of English language (Seidlhofer, 2005; Sung, 2013).

Up to now, it has been asserted that bilingual users of ELF hold the right to disclose their L1 identities (Jenkins, 2002) and their accent is one of the elements through which they can sustain their own L1 identities. In a similar vein, Jenkins (2003) also pointed out that L2 speakers “frequently voice a desire to preserve something of their L1 accent as a means of expressing their own identity in English rather than identifying it with its L1 English users” (p. 125). Hence, it has been maintained that ELF users or L2 speakers of English ought to be approved in using English with their own accent. This would also mean providing L2 speakers with the sociolinguistic benefits experienced by native speakers (Kirkpatrick, 2007; Walker, 2010). Furthermore, Jenkins (2000) veritably asserted, “insisting on learners conforming to target-language pronunciation norms and renouncing those of mother tongue” (p. 16) would even indicate the rejection of their own identities. At the dawn of the new millennium and ELF research, Canagarajah (1999) stated that the concept of identity should be considered as a notion, which is closely related with ideological, social and even political terminology in ELF literature, and the attempt to define and theorize identity-accent relationship can well be the attempt to reconsider and challenge the predominance of L1 or native English.

When looked from a different perspective, using English in ELF contexts can be motivating for L2 speakers as it may give them the identity construction of a world citizen, and a feeling of affinity with the English-using world (Sung, 2013; Ushioda, 2013). Indeed, as Turnbull and Arnett (2002) asserted the identity of a world citizen, especially for younger generation, may mean that they are a part of the culture that is prevalent in the world. Such kind of a global identity may well correspond in multicultural and multinational ELF contexts in which English is globally used. Furthermore, Baker (2011) claimed that as ELF or L2 speakers use English for communicative purposes in divergent and flexible communities, they are also given the chance to build up one or more global or local identities.

In ELF literature, there has been an expanding tendency to investigate the issue of identity on part of ELF speakers (e.g. Baker, 2011; Jenkins, 2007). Yet, to the knowledge of the researcher, there are relatively few research studies aiming to explore the issue of identity for bilingual ELF speakers with regard to their accent preferences. Jenkins’ (2007) study is one of the primary studies looking into accent and identity relationship in ELF communication. Jenkins (2007) conducted detailed semi-structured interviews with 17 non-native EFL instructors, from different national backgrounds to explore their choices on identity. The findings of the study showed that the participants held diverse attitudes towards the idea of being an ELF member in an international context. As for their L1 identity while using English,

their attitudes were contradictory. Although they felt affinity with their mother tongue as a significant component of their identity, they also favored the identity of a native speaker and accordingly a native-like accent. Indeed, Jenkins (2007) concluded that the instructors favored “a native-like English identity as signaled by a native-like accent” (p. 231) because a native-like English accent would also indicate their proficiency in English and thus increase their chance of being successful as an English instructor.

In his mixed method research study, Li (2009) looked into the concepts of intelligibility and identity for bilingual ELF speakers in Hong Kong. With this aim, he analyzed the data gathered from 107 participants via a questionnaire and a focus group discussion conducted with 10 participants. The findings of the study showed that majority of the participants stated they would prefer to use English with a nativespeaker accent. The researcher concluded that the participants were in a dilemma whether to choose intelligibility or identity. This dilemma stemmed from the fact that speaking with a local accent and thus disclosing their identity instead of a native-like accent could hinder intelligibility in communication in ELF contexts. Yet, in this study conducted by Li (2009), the perception of identity was only conceptualized with regard to the local accent, and such kind of an approach did not consider the probability of preferring to have a different accent and thus identity reconstruction in ELF communication or settings.

In Italian context, Pedrazzin and Nava (2011) explored EFL teachers’ identity constructions and preferences and noted that the teachers preferred to reflect their identities as language teachers who were trying to achieve and teach native speaker norms, not as non-native ELF users. The results once again indicated that the dominance and image of native speaker model was still valid even in a European

context and the identity presented with ELF was still associated with some kind of linguistic incompetency. In contrast with these findings, the study conducted by Kalocsai (2013), in again a European context, proved that the exchange students favored the identity of an ELF speaker. Being able to communicate in English in a multinational and multilingual context, without the fear of being right or wrong with reference to a standard norm gave them the chance to express their identities as nonnative ELF speakers.

In his recent qualitative study on the construction of language identities, Sung (2020) explored the language identities of tertiary level bilingual students in Hong Kong in ELF communication. The results of the study revealed the participants accepted that they had a kind of two-fold identity as language learners and users. Moreover, the students had different identity constructions depending on the interlocutor and context, being native or non-native. These results are important in terms of pointing out to the diversified and volatile characteristic of language identities, especially in ELF communication contexts.

In Turkish context, Bayyurt and Ersin (2012) investigated how Turkish teachers teaching English in an EFL context constructed their identities in ELF communication and contexts. The results of the thematic analysis showed that the teachers were aware of and understood the concept of ELF to some extent; yet they had not considered themselves ELF users. Moreover, they preferred to form their professional identities pertaining to native speaker norms or models. Such kind of an understanding would naturally result in traditional teaching practices trying to achieve the native-speaker model as the ultimate aim.

# Language Attitudes towards Accents

Research in the field of language attitudes is not new; it can even date back to the time of Aristotle who believed that the manner or style with which someone spoke had an impact on his/her recognized trustworthiness. Research studies conducted in the early 20th century maintained that some language varieties were linked to prominence whereas some others were linked to different types of blemish (Bradac, 1990). Yet, the first study on language attitudes in accordance with the contemporary understanding was conducted by Lambert, Hodgson, Gardner, and Fillenbaum in 1960. In that study, they brought out the matched-guise technique to evaluate the language attitudes. Adopting an innovative approach, they made use of the bilingual speakers’ recordings of the same text in two different versions (French version and translated English version), and upon listening to the recordings, participants adjudged the speaker’s different characteristics such as being intelligent, kind... etc. The findings of this study showed that not only English- speaking participants but also French speaking ones considered English version or English speakers as being more intelligent or likeable. Hence, it was concluded that the language of a person could affect the interpretation of the personality traits of that person to an important extent.

Later, in her dissertation study, Botterman (1995) explored the attitudes of Flemish students towards five different English accents that are national (i.e., American, British, Australian, Scottish and Irish). The findings of the study showed that British accent (Received Pronunciation/ RP) was the most favorable one in terms of indicating the speakers’ positive personal characteristics, capacity and common prestige. British accent was followed by American accent, leaving the other three national accents behind.

In his international research study, Timmis (2002) gathered data from 180 instructors and 400 students via a questionnaire and complementary interviews from 45 different countries. The main aim of this study was to explore the attitudes of students and teachers towards varieties of English in terms of accepted standard grammar norms, pronunciation and spoken language. In order to interpret the data from different nationalities, the researcher grouped the answers from different countries and at the end of the analysis concluded that both parties- students and teachers- considered standard native speaker norms to be the acceptable and favorable English.

The preference of native accent or norms over non-native ones also included judgements about the speaker’s personality or characteristics. The study by Bresnahan et al. (2002) indicated that in the evaluation of non-native accents, intelligibility was the main factor that affected the participants’ attitudes towards those accents. When the non-native accents were more intelligible, the participants thought the speakers had more positive characteristics such as being diligent or energetic.

In a similar vein, Jenkins (2007) investigated the attitudes of the English instructors towards accents (both native and non-native) and standard norms via a questionnaire. The findings of this study showed that the instructors favored native speaker accents more because of the accuracy and intelligibility. According to Jenkins, this would also indicate the traditional approach in teaching the English language, where native and standard norms are over-emphasized and varieties are considered as unwanted mistakes.

Another extensive study conducted by Coupland and Bishop (2007) asserted that accent varieties which are considered as standard or native received higher

scores on positive reputation and allurement categories than the ones which are considered as non-standard. The findings of this study also showed that standard or native accents were favored less by the younger participants and there were considerable differences between the evaluations of different genders, women having evaluations that are more positive.

Furthermore, Lev-Ari and Boaz (2010) conducted a study to explore the credibility of non-native speakers, both with mild and heavy accents. The results obtained in this study showed that native American listeners considered non-native speakers to be less credible compared to native speakers. The researchers concluded this might stem from the fact that non-native accents, especially the heavy ones, may make the language harder to understand. Yet, they also asserted that this could well be the result of the bias against non-native speakers and negative generalizations.

Moreover, Hanzlikova and Skasnitzl (2017) replicated the study of Lev-Ari and Boaz (2010) with the aim to investigate whether that negative impression of nonnative accents was also pertinent for non-native listeners. The results of this study confirmed that non-native listeners also had negative reactions towards non-native speakers or accents. Thus, the researchers concluded, “foreign-accented speech may be associated with lower credibility ratings by non-native listeners” which was similar to the case with native listeners (p. 296).

Adopting the verbal-guise technique, McKenzie (2010) explored the attitudes of tertiary level Japanese students towards native and non-native English accents. The findings of the study indicated that native accents were found to be more favorable than non-native ones (e.g. Japanese accent) with regard to “competence”. Yet, the students rated the non-native Japanese accents higher with regard to some certain traits such as “solidarity.” Thus, based on the relevant literature, the

researcher concluded that this difference could stem from the conscious or unconscious favoring of the group the speakers belong to, indicating their national identity as well.

In a more up-to-date study by Pollard (2011), the perceptions of Korean students towards non-native accents or varieties of English were explored. The findings of this qualitative study, which collected the data through semi-structured interviews after the participants listened to different audio fragments, showed that the native speaker accent and norms were considered the best or ideal form of English rather than the non-native varieties. In a similar vein, Ahmed, Abdullah, and Heng (2014) investigated 120 tertiary level students’ attitudes towards different accents. After the participants listened to the recordings representing different accents, they completed scales consisting of seven different options such as friendliness, selfconfidence etc. The results of the study showed that, contrary to the main stream in literature, the students favored non-native accents more than the native ones. The researchers concluded that the obtained results were in accordance with the theory of social identity.

Whether British accent (RP) or general American accent (GA) is favored more as a native accent has also been looked into in language attitudes literature. In the study by Simon (2005), it was found that tertiary level students considered RP as the standard norm. Moreover, achieving a native-like sound of English was seen as the ultimate target of learning English. Another study conducted by Ladegaard and Shachdev (2006), asserted that students preferred RP to GA although they found American culture, lifestyle and showed that students made their choice for GA instead of RP as they thought it was easier to master and more direct and clear than RP. However, the students also stated that RP is more correct and attractive. Another significant finding of this study was that an important part of the students maintained that they did not like the idea of making a choice between the two. This may indicate that because of the globalization and fluid usage of the English language, some students refuse the categorization of standard norms or varieties.

In Turkish context, studies in language attitudes towards native and nonnative accents have been scarce. Up to now, researchers have mainly worked on the pedagogical implications of pronunciation and emphasized appropriate pronunciation teaching in Turkey (e.g. Cakir, 2012; Celik, 2008; Demirezen, 2007). Hismanoglu (2012) even suggested that in Turkey, non-native English instructors lacked the necessary phonological competence for proper pronunciation teaching and this caused incompetence in terms of pronunciation on part of the learners, too. With a slightly different approach, Coşkun (2011) explored the understandings of future English teachers on English as an International Language (EIL) pronunciation via questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, and concluded that prospective English teachers considered the native speaker accent to be the correct pronunciation model in classroom teaching. Hence, the researcher maintained that it was essential to raise more awareness on the current position of ELF and non-native varieties of English in Turkey in teaching and learning contexts.

In more recent times, researchers in Turkey have started to investigate the attitudes of English language instructors and students towards different accent or varieties and towards the speaker’s personality traits. Yıldız (2017) conducted a research study at a state university with both the instructors and students. The researcher used Test of English for International Communication (TOEIC) tests and a questionnaire for data collection. The results obtained in this study revelaed that more students favored native accents and preferred to have native speaker teachers as they thought this would help them improve their language skills. Moreover, it was pointed out that they were biased towards non-native accents and thought they were not intelligible enough. Furthermore, in her study, Kemaloğlu-Er (2017) looked into the perceptions of tertiary level students towards native and non-native accents. The findings of both the questionnaire and interviews asserted that the students considered native teachers more energetic, easygoing and positive. In contrast, nonnative teachers were considered as strict and depending on the text books more than the native teachers.

In a similar vein, in her master’s thesis research study, Ceyhan-Bingöl (2018) explored the perceptions and practices of in-service English language teachers towards ELF and different accents at a private university in Turkey. The results of the study revealed that the majority of the participants were feeling discomfortable about their non-native or non-standard accents although they were familiar with ELF or World Englishes. Moreover, in their classroom teaching practices, they preferred to utilize native, standard norms instead of non-native varieties. To conclude, the findings of these studies in the Turkish context show that there is a need to explore the attitudes of both teachers and students towards different accents in a more indepth manner to be able to come up with more general and applicable pedagogical implications.

# Ownership of English Language

The question of the ownership of English language has been increasingly attracting the attention of scholars in the field, with English spoken by an increasing number of non-native speakers each day. In fact, it was Widdowson (1994) who started the discussion on the ownership issue, and since then there have been several controversies. Widdowson (1994) clearly maintained that English could only be

considered as an international language when it was no more the language of a specific nation. Rajagopalan (2006) summarized this approach, as “…forsaking ‘ownership’ of it is the price you have to pay for celebrating the transformation of your language into a world language” (p. 210). Again, Rajagopalan (2004) asserted, “World English (WE) belongs to everybody who speaks it, but it is nobody’s mother tongue” (p. 111). Such kind of an approach to ELF or World Englishes brings about the question of how to position native speakers of English in the ownership discussion.

In fact, the ownership of English language has been more obscured and controversial recently as the number of the non-native speakers is increasing every single day (Graddol, 2006). In fact, Norton (2018) maintained that although the ownership may be pertinent to any language, it is much more common for English language “because of its power on the world stage, its diverse uses and users, and the opportunities it provides for those who can speak, read, and write it, both online and offline.” (p. 1). Indeed, recent research in the field tend to approach the question of who owns the English language with concepts like multiculturalism, multilingualism, ELF and identity as well (e.g. Holliday, 2009; Le Ha, 2009). With ELF and World Englishes recognized and understood more thoroughly, it is maintained that English language pertains any speaker who uses it anywhere in the world for communicative purposes. Holliday (2009) asserted that speakers all over the world should not be compared to or controlled by “a language standard by virtue of place of birth” (p. 151), thus the idea of considering the native speakers as the holders of the language would be rejected.

It is also worth emphasizing that the materials used in teaching English has been commonly and mainly under the dominance of inner circle countries ownership.

McKay (2012) maintained that in most teaching materials the “focus on the culture of the ‘target’ country, in most cases the culture of English-speaking countries (e.g. the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia)” is obvious (p. 72). Such kind of a practice conflicts with the basic nature of ELF because ELF is regarded as a transnational and transcultural variety and it is not specifically associated with any single culture (Splunder, 2013).

# Beliefs about the Role of English

One of the issues that have been arousing interest in academia has been what the learners and teachers’ beliefs are about the role of English language and the use of ELF(e.g. Csizer & Kontra, 2012; Pan & Block, 2011). Recently, as ELF has been appearing frequently in literature, previous knowledge and vision on beliefs about the roles of English needs to be re-examined considering the extra roles it has taken on with ELF.

In their research study conducted in Chinese context, Pan and Block (2011) looked into language learners and teachers’ beliefs about the role of English as a global language. The findings of the studyindicated that because of its essential function in communication and importance for the exam system, English was considered instrumental and important.

In a similar vein, Csizer and Kontra (2012) investigated whether the students were aware of ELF and what they believed to be the function of English language as a lingua franca. The results revealed that although the students were aware of ELF in a global context, their ideas about the role of English and their own learning aims were still dependent upon native norms or standards.

It should be emphasized that several studies conducted so far noted beliefs are complicated and active (Mercer, 2011), and they are connected with how people feel open to change. Today’s world conditions and advances in technology and education have also updated the requirements to be fulfilled by especially tertiary level students. University students and graduates all over the world need to read, write, report and research in English. Moreover, both for their academic and social life, they have to speak English in lingua franca contexts and maintain communication. Such kind of a context may have changed the students and teachers beliefs towards the role of English.

In accordance with this, several researchers investigated the relationship between the beliefs of language learners about the role of English, whether in their own surroundings or abroad ELF settings (e.g. Baker, 2009; Tanaka & Ellis, 2003). Kaypak and Ortaçtepe (2014) looked into the relationship between the beliefs of Turkish exchange students about the role of English and their study abroad experiences in ELF contexts. The findings of the study noted that the pre and post beliefs of the participants almost stayed the same. Yet, although the participants considered the native or standard forms important, they focused on intelligibility more than accuracy. This would well show that their focus shifted to communication, which can be considered as something expected in ELF contexts. Moreover, their pre and post beliefs confirmed that English language is necessary and functional in the global context.

In a similar vein, in a qualitative research study conducted by Yang (2011), pre-service English language teachers’ beliefs and attitudes towards an abroad experience program and the role of English were investigated. The results obtained from the study showed that the participants found the abroad visit highly contributing to their understanding of their students’ learning experience in Hong Kong ESL context.

Overall, the changing role of English has started to reshape the beliefs of learners and teachers about the role of English language. The learners are conscious that they need to use the language effectively not only for their academic success but also for their future career plans and social lives as world citizens. Similarly, the beliefs of the teachers about the role of English language need to be updated because the classroom practices should also be revised in accordance with the current needs and beliefs of both parties.

# Conclusion

In this chapter, related literature on ELF, attitudes towards ELF and ELF communication, language attitudes towards different accents, ownership of English language and beliefs about the role of English were examined. In the following chapter, the details about the research design, participants, setting, data collection instrument, data collection and analysis procedure will be reviewed in detail.

# CHAPTER 3: METHODOLOGY

# Introduction

The purpose of this descriptive research study is to explore Turkish EFL (English as a foreign language) instructors’ and students’ perceptions on English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) and native and non-native accents of English. The study also aims to find out how the EFL instructors and students see the position and ownership of English as a native language and as a lingua franca all over the world and their own use of ELF. To this end, the following research questions were addressed:

1. What are the perceptions of English language instructors towards ELF and to what extent are they aware of the concept of ELF?   
2. What are the perceptions of students towards ELF and to what extent are they aware of the concept of ELF?   
3. Who do English language instructors consider the owner of the English language?   
4. Who do the students consider the owner of the English language?   
5. What beliefs about and attitudes towards native and non-native accents of English (i.e. American English, British English, Spanish English, and Turkish English) do English language instructors and students have?   
6. Do the attitudes of English instructors towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits differ significantly based on their perceptions and awareness of ELF?   
7. Do the students’ attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits differ significantly based on their perceptions and awareness of ELF?   
8. Do beliefs and attitudes towards different English accents differ significantly depending on being an English instructor or student?   
9. Is there any statistically significant difference between English instructors and students in terms of the variables below?

i. emotional beliefs about English ii. functional beliefs about English iii. time of the day? iv. attitudes towards English pronunciation v. beliefs about the speaker’s own competence vi. attitudes towards ELF vii. attitudes towards ELF communication viii. the speaker’s identity ix. language anxiety

# Research Design

This descriptive, non-experimental research study adopts a quantitative approach. First, this study is descriptive as it attempts to explore the perceptions and attitudes of EFL instructors and students towards ELF. As Gall, Gall, and Borg (2007) assert descriptive research aims to provide the answer to the question of “what”, instead of “how” and “why”. In accordance with this, the current study seeks to explain what the perceptions and attitudes of instructors and students towards ELF are. Moreover, the data were collected via an online survey and as Fraenkel, Hyun, and Wallen (2012) state, “In educational research, the most common descriptive methodology is the survey, as when researchers summarize the characteristics (abilities, preferences, behaviors, and so on) of individuals or groups or (sometimes) physical environments (such as schools).” (p. 15). This study is also non

experimental since non-experimental research does not have the manipulation or control of independent variables (O'Dwyer & Bernauer, 2013).

With respect to sampling, the participants of this study are 78 EFL instructors and 214 English prep school students at a state university in Turkey. As for sampling, convenience sampling was utilized as the instructors and students were at the same institution where the researcher currently works. Moreover, the sample in this study is a subset of the population as Dörnyei (2007) states “…the sample is a subset of the population that is representative of the whole population” (p. 96). In terms of the data analysis, the data gathered from the survey were analyzed quantitatively. In the analysis procedure, both descriptive (e.g., averages, percentages and frequencies) and inferential statistics (e.g., ANOVA and independent samples ttest) were used. The researcher adopted an objective and unbiased attitude in the application process of the statistics.

# Setting

This study was conducted at a state university located in the central Anatolia region in Turkey. The online survey was implemented at the school of foreign languages of this institution. Before implementing the survey, the researcher first sought the permission of Bilkent University Ethics Committee. To this end, the application form was filled out and this application form required information on the subject, title of the study, the setting and the participants, the instruments, and data collection processes. Moreover, the survey link, which was planned to be used for data collection and the consent form, were presented as attachment. Bilkent University Ethics Committee approved the form (22/10/2019- 2019_10_22_05) and gave the necessary permission. Then, the researcher sought the permission of the school of foreign languages where the study was going to take place by filling out

the application form in a detailed way and attaching the survey link and consent form. After a detailed examination process, the Committee at the School of Foreign Languages gave the necessary permission. Thus, the researcher first started to share the survey link with the instructors. As the study also included students as participants, the survey link was shared with the students in their online lab classes as they already worked on computer in those classes. The data were collected in 2019-2020 academic year Fall semester. The pilot study for this study was not conducted on purpose because the study included listening fragments and aimed at exploring the participants’ attitudes towards the accents in the listening fragments and piloting would mean sharing the listening fragments and this would affect the results.

# Participants

The participants of this study were the EFL instructors and students at the English preparatory school of foreign languages at a state university in Turkey. Firstly, after the online survey link was sent to the 168 instructors via their institutional e-mail addresses, 127 instructors started answering the survey questions. However, 49 of these participants did not finish the survey; since their answers were incomplete, they were removed from the data. Hence, the number of participants for the instructors fell to 78. After applying the necessary response rate formula, it was found that the response rate for the instructors after the data was cleaned up was $6 1 . 4 \%$ . In terms of their professional qualifications, 37 of the instructors had BA degrees, 26 had MA degrees and 13 of them had PhD degrees in the field. 10 participants clicked on the “other (CELTA, DELTA, distance education etc.)” option for their professional qualifications $( N = 7 8$ ) (See Table 1).

\*This variable is in multiple response format.

The survey link was distributed to 257 students in their online English classes conducted in computer labs. Yet, as 43 of the participants had some missing answers, their answers had to be removed from the data during the data cleanup session. The number of students who participated in this research study fell to 214, and the response rate for the student participants in the cleaned-up data was calculated as $8 3 . 3 \%$ . All participants were English prep school students, receiving education at different success levels (A, B, C, and D- with D being the beginner level). In terms of their departments, 79 of the participants were from the Faculty of Engineering, 33 of them were from the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences, 21 were from the Faculty of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 17 were from the Faculty of

Architecture and Design, 10 were from the Faculty of Science, 9 were from the Faculty of Humanities, 3 were from the Faculty of Education, 2 were from the Faculty of Fine Arts, 1 was from the Faculty of Sports Sciences, and 38 students clicked on the “other” option for their departments $N = 2 1 4$ ). At the school of foreign languages prep school, 26 of the participants were at A level, 93 of them were at B level, 44 of them were at C level, and lastly 51 of them were at D level (N $= 2 1 4 )$ ). They had at least 4 hours of English classes every day, 6 hours on two or three days of the week, depending on their level. The institution implements an integrated-skills approach in teaching and the assessment system is based on the testing of receptive and productive skills and grammar. The passing grade is 60/100 in their overall score and the students who get at least 60 out of 100 in the proficiency exam can continue their education at their departments (See Table 2).

# Instrumentation

The online survey (instructor and student versions) which was used to explore Turkish EFL instructors and students’ perceptions on English as a Lingua Franca and attitudes towards native and non-native accents consisted of four sections (Appendix A). Since it is presumed that the quality of the data would be better if the participants answered the survey items in their mother tongue (Dörnyei & Taguchi, 2010), the student version of the survey was translated into Turkish. Thus, the researcher assured that the students understand the items and the terms used thoroughly. It is also important to mention that the translated version was also backtranslated into English by two experts to make sure that each statement is explained clearly and correctly compared to the original version. An Informed Consent Form (See Appendix B) providing explanation of the research procedure was submitted to inform the participants before the survey was initiated.

The aim of the questions in the first section of the survey was to explore the perceptions of the participants about Standard English, general awareness of ELF, the participants’ own accents and different accents, the function of culture and cultural elements in teaching and learning English and the ownership of the language. There were eleven questions in the first section of the student survey version. All the items, except for item nine, were adapted from the questionnaire developed by İnceçay and Akyel (2014). In the teacher version of the survey, there were 13 items as the last two questions were to investigate whether ELF was included in their educational background. The first eleven items were the same in both versions, with small changes made in the wording of the questions such as using the word “teaching” for teachers, and using the word “learning” for students in the statements. Item nine in both versions of the survey was adapted from the

questionnaire developed by Sifakis et al. (2005) and its aim was to look into the participants’ perceptions of the ownership of the English language. The function of the open-ended questions in this section of the survey was to enhance the data and thus increase the reliability of the possible results.

In the second section of the survey, the participants listened to four different audio fragments representing four different accents. Two of these accents were native- General American (GA) and Received Pronunciation (RP) / British. The other two were Spanish and Turkish accents. To form the fragments, two native and two non-native speaker recordings were made using a voice-recording device. The recordings were based on a text of around 85 words and the same text was used for all four fragment-recordings (See Appendix C). As the aim was to explore attitudes towards different accents, choosing a text that was as neutral as possible regarding its content and structure was important (DeMeerleer, 2012). Thus, the text selected was about mindfulness and taken from the official website of British Council (https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/general-english/magazine/mindfulness).

Moreover, regarding the text’s neutrality, the researcher consulted the experts at one private and one public higher education institution and they also considered the text politically and scientifically neutral. To be able to delimitate the variables as much as possible, the speakers were chosen from the same sex (male) and approximately the same age range. Furthermore, the recordings were taped under the same physical conditions; in a quiet room with the voice-recording device located at the same distance from the speakers. Yet again, the fragments were taped a few times, and finally, to ensure the inter-rater reliability, the researcher and the supervisor together chose the best one for each fragment in terms of clarity, sound and speed. Then, these fragments were inserted into the Qualtrics survey tool as part of the survey prompts. The two native speakers of English made the recordings for the British and American accent fragments. A British instructor who was born and raised in London made the recording for the British accent. For the American accent, again an instructor from New York with an American origin was recorded. The Turkish accent fragment was recorded by a Turkish EFL instructor, which was chosen among five other speakers to be the most suitable one for the purpose of this study. It took more time to decide on the Spanish speaker as many different speakers were recorded and the experts who are knowledgeable about the accent of Spanish speakers of English were consulted more than once for the most appropriate one. In the end, a Spanish engineer living in Seville was chosen and his recording was used in the survey. Upon hearing each fragment, the participants were required to fill out 10 items for each fragment.

The aim of the first four items was to measure the attitudes of the participants towards different accents and they were targeted at four aspects: (i) the beauty of the sound/language (ii) the wish to speak English with this accent (iii) limpidity (iv) conformance for international communication (Jenkins, 2007). A five-point Likert scale ( $1 =$ strongly disagree, $5 =$ strongly agree) was applied for rating. The remaining six items looked into the attitudes of the participants towards the speaker’s personality traits. Based on previous speaker assessment research, six adjectives were given to evaluate the personal characteristics of the speakers (DeMeerleer, 2012). Accordingly, the categorization was as follows: The first aspect, competence, was investigated with two adjectives; intelligent and self-confident. The second aspect, solidarity, was investigated with other two adjectives; polite and trustworthy. Lastly, the third aspect, status, was investigated with two adjectives; well-educated and authoritative (DeMeerleer, 2012). Again, a five-point Likert scale ( $1 =$ strongly

disagree, $5 =$ strongly agree) was applied for rating. This second section of the survey was the same in the teacher and student versions.

Direct technique was used in the third section of the survey to explore the attitudes and beliefs of participants about ELF, ELF communication and identity. This section of the survey included 32 items in the teacher version and 34 items in the student version. A five-point Likert scale ( $1 =$ strongly disagree, $ 5 { = }$ strongly agree) was applied for rating. The items in this part were taken from existing and reliable questionnaires (Czisier & Kontra, 2012; DeMeerleer, 2012; Ke & Cahyani, 2014). The source of each item is given in the appendix (See Appendix D).

The first 32 items were the same in the teacher and student version except for item 23. The student version included two more items (i.e., 33rd and 34th items). Item 23 was “Studying English is important because I will need it for my career.” in student version. In teacher version, it was “It would be better if people on international conferences would not only speak English but other languages as well, such as my native language.”. In accordance with the study by DeMeerleer (2012), the following constructs were used to categorize the items:

(i) emotional beliefs about English (items 11, 31)   
(ii) functional beliefs about English (items 1, 4, 23(S), 30, 34) (iii) attitudes towards English pronunciation (items 8, 12, 22, 27) (iv) beliefs about the speaker’s own competence (items 6, 21, 33) (v) attitudes towards ELF (items 3, 7, 15, 16, 19, 23 (T), 24, 28) (vi) attitudes towards ELF communication (items 14, 20, 26) (vii) the speaker’s identity (items 5, 9, 13, 17, 18, 25, 29, 32) (viii) language anxiety (items 2,10) (p.43)   
All items are given within a random placement.

The fourth section of the survey was the demographics part, and it consisted of five different subsections: age, gender, home country, department and level at preparatory school for students; and for teachers the subsections were age, gender, home country, years of teaching experience and professional qualifications. These subsections were intended to explore the possible differences and relationships among these variables in terms of the perceptions of ELF and to provide better descriptive information about the participants of the current study.

# Data Collection Procedure

When the proofreading and checking of the survey was completed, an online version was created by using the Qualtrics website. Qualtrics is a licensed and reliable website that is easy to use. Upon the approval of Bilkent University Ethics Committee, the permission from the state university’s school of foreign languages department was also obtained. The researcher sent the online link of the survey to the instructors via their institutional e-mail addresses. The students were provided with the online link of the survey in their online English classes conducted at computer labs. An informed consent form which contained a short information about the study procedure and stated that the information gathered would be kept strictly confidential and would only be used for research purposes preceded the survey questions. Upon agreeing to participate, the participants answered the survey questions, which approximately took 10-12 minutes. The data collection lasted for six weeks.

# Data Analysis

Within the scope of this study, quantitative data collected through an online survey were used. The qualitative data collected from the answers to the open ended questions were not used for the purpose of this study. The collected quantitative data were analyzed by using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v.25. To be able to provide the answers of the research questions of this study, descriptive and inferential statistics were used.

To be able to answer research questions 6, 7, 8 and 9, One-way ANOVA and independent samples t-test analyzes, which are among the sub-groups of inferential statistics, were used. Moreover, in research questions 6, 7, 8, and 9, if there were two or more different accents with significant differences, Pearson Correlation Analysis was performed to determine whether the attitudes towards these accents and the attitudes towards the speaker in the speech samples were related, and if so, what the level of this relationship was.

Independent Samples t-test is an analysis method used to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference between two groups. In the analysis, there are two groups whose means are to be compared and these groups are independent from each other (Knapp, 2018). One-way ANOVA is used to determine if there is a statistically significant difference among the means of more than two groups (Howitt & Cramer, 2017). The analysis determines whether the means of these groups statistically differ from each other. However, this analysis only shows if there is a difference among the groups and an appropriate multiple comparison test (POST-HOC) should be used to determine which groups are different. There are many options in POST-HOC tests. Although the basic function of all of them is basically the same, there are different algorithms that they use to find out which groups differ among depending on whether the variances are distributed equally or not. Among these tests, Tukey and Bonferroni tests are the most commonly used for groups whose variances are homogeneously distributed. However, if variances are not distributed homogeneously between groups, Tamhane test is widely used. According to the homogeneous distribution of variances, it would be enough to

select only one of them (Knapp, 2018). In this research study, the Tukey test was used for the groups whose variances were distributed homogeneously; and Tamhane test was used for groups whose variances were not distributed homogeneously.

Lastly, correlation analysis is an analysis that is used to determine whether there is a relationship between two variables (Howitt & Cramer, 2017). The correlation coefficient calculated as a result of this analysis is shown as $r$ and takes a value between $^ { - 1 }$ and $+ 1$ . A positive $( + )$ value of this coefficient indicates that there is a positive relationship between the two variables, while a negative $( - )$ value indicates that there is a negative relationship between the two variables. If the value of this coefficient is 0, it indicates that there is no significant relationship between the two variables (Knapp, 2018).

# Assumptions

# Normality Assumption

Because of the fact that many tests used in statistical studies requires that the data used in the study meet the normal distribution or are distributed close to normal, normality assumption is an important factor to be checked (Mayers, 2013). The assumption of normality can be checked by comparing the skewness and kurtosis values with the cutoff values recommended in the literature. Within the scope of this study, the assumption of normality was checked for statistical tests to be used in research questions 6, 7 and 9. In this context, skewness and kurtosis values were examined in accordance with the approach proposed by Sposito, Hand, and Skarpness (1983). When the skewness or kurtosis value (s) is above $( + / - ) 2 . 2$ , it can be stated that the item or items with this value cause problems for normality assumption (Sposito et al., 1983). Therefore, those that exceed the recommended cutoff value should be removed from the analyses within the scope of the normality assumption. Then, the data are considered to provide normality with the remaining items.

# The Homogeneity of Variances Assumption

The assumption of homogeneity of variances is an assumption that is used in independent samples t-test and ANOVA. This assumption affirms that the groups to be compared present the same variance. In this context, the term homogeneity is related to being the same or alike. Hence, the assumption of homogeneity of variances requires checking the variances of the groups (two groups for independent samples t-test; three+ groups for One-way ANOVA) in terms of their similarity (Mayers, 2013).

Within the scope of this study, the assumption of homogeneity for the variances related to independent samples t-test was checked by evaluating the significance of the Levene’s test. While the significance of the “equal variances assumed” option is used in homogenously distributed variances $( p > . 0 5 )$ , the significance of the “equal variances not assumed” in non-homogeneous variances $( p$ $< . 0 5 )$ is examined (Knapp, 2018). For One-Way ANOVA, while ANOVA statistics were utilized in homogenously distributed variances $( p > . 0 5 )$ , the significance of Brown-Forsythe statistics was checked in non-homogeneous variances $( p < . 0 5 )$ (Mayers, 2013). Results regarding the homogeneous distribution of variances for research questions 6, 7, 8 and 9 are presented in appendix $\mathrm { G } , \mathrm { J } , \mathrm { L }$ and N, respectively.

For the analysis, first the collected data were exported as an SPSS document from Qualtrics website for the quantitative analysis. Then, before the analysis, the data were checked, arranged and cleaned up. The reliability analyses were conducted at several steps.

# Item Reliability Analysis of the Study

The reliability analysis of the scales in part B of the questionnaire used in the study was performed by using Cronbach’s Alpha reliability coefficient. In section C, the exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was not applied to the multidimensional scale used to measure the “attitudes and beliefs of participants about ELF, ELF communication and identity”. Instead, Cronbach’s Alpha reliability analysis was performed directly. EFA is a type of analysis that transforms groups into new variables by dividing multiple variables into a certain number of groups, making the relationship between the variables within each group maximum and the relationship between the groups minimum. These new variables are called factors (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2019). While it is maintained that there should be at least 100 or over cases in the dataset, which would be analyzed using EFA, the necessity to have 20 cases for each item is emphasized in order to obtain more reliable and valid results from this analysis (Hair et al., 2019). In compliance with this, EFA was not applied as the scale in part C did not provide sufficient conditions for teachers. On the other hand, EFA was not applied for the students either, as in this study a) it was aimed to make a comparison between groups and b) EFA could not be utilized for teachers. Instead, the scale was used with the factor structure in the study in which it was referenced.

In the Cronbach’s Alpha reliability analysis conducted, Alpha coefficient, corrected item-total correlation values (Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient if item deleted option) were evaluated. Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient is a measure of the reliability coefficient and evaluates the internal consistency of a scale. If the coefficient obtained at the end of this analysis is .60 and above, it means that the internal consistency of the scale used is sufficient (Pallant, 2010). Hence, the scale can be

considered reliable. Corrected item-total correlation value (CIT) is the correlation value in which items within a scale individually contribute to the overall scale internal consistency (Cronbach’s Alpha coefficient) (Hair et al., 2019). Although the statements in a scale are expected to have a corrected item-total correlation value above .5 as a rule, .3 and above are also at an acceptable level (Cristobal, Flavian, & Guinaliu, 2007; Hair et al., 2019). On the other hand, the Alpha coefficient (Cronbach’s Alpha if item deleted option - IID) obtained when the item is deleted also represents the new Alpha coefficient to be obtained when the relevant item is taken out of the scale. Here, the researcher has adopted the condition that Alpha coefficient increases significantly $( > 0 . 1 0 )$ when the relevant item is removed from the scale. The results obtained from the analysis is shared respectively for the instructors and students (see Table 3).

Cronbach’s Alpha reliability analysis for the B part of the instructor data showed that the Alpha coefficient obtained for all fragments was above the recommended threshold value (Hair et al., 2019). It was determined that only one item (Q13-3) that is not above the recommended threshold value for CIT is included (Cristobal et al., 2007).

Even though it is observed that the Alpha coefficient will increase as a result of taking out some items in terms of IID, no item has been taken out due to the fact that this increase is not too high and the Alpha coefficient of the scale in question is high enough $( { \bf q } = . 8 0 )$ ) (Pallant, 2010). As such, it was concluded that the scales in part B for instructor data were reliable (See Table 4).

As a result of Cronbach’s Alpha reliability analysis for the B part of the student data, it was observed that the Alpha coefficient obtained for all fragments was above the recommended threshold value (Hair et al., 2019). It was observed that results above the threshold value were obtained in terms of CIT, too (Cristobal et al., 2007). However, although it is observed that the Alpha coefficient will increase as a result of taking out some items in terms of IID, this has not been utilized as this increase is not very high (Pallant, 2010). As such, it was concluded that the scales in section B for student data were reliable (See Table 4).

In Section C, as a result of Cronbach’s Alpha reliability analysis for both teacher and student datasets, under the factor structure put forward by DeMeerleer (2012) Alpha scores of the factors were found between .29-.69 for the instructors and between .21-.65 for students. These obtained results showed that some factors of this scale are not reliable for the teacher and student dataset, and should not be used within the scope of this study accordingly (Hair et al., 2019). As such, the researcher did not conduct factorial analysis (without calculating composite scores-arithmetic mean); instead, item-based analysis was found to be more appropriate. Item-based analysis was also conducted using the items included in the factors. (For more detailed reliability information, see Appendix E)

# Conclusion

In this chapter, the research design was explained in connection with the research questions. The overall information about the setting, participants, instrumentation, data collection and analysis procedures were also provided. The next chapter focuses on the data analysis process and presents the results of the data analysis.

# CHAPTER 4: RESULTS

# Introduction

Within the scope of this study, the perceptions of 78 English instructors and 214 English prep school students were investigated based on the research questions listed in the previous chapter. An online-adapted survey which consisted of four sections (See Appendix A) was utilized to gather the data. An Informed Consent Form (See Appendix B) presenting the explanation of the research procedure was provided to the participants to inform them about the procedures before the survey. The first section of the survey consisted of items aiming to explore the perceptions of the participants about Standard English, general awareness of ELF, the participants’ own accents and different accents, the function of culture and cultural elements in teaching and learning English and the ownership of the language. In the second section, the participants listened to four different versions of the same audio fragment, representing four different accents and the items following the fragments were aimed at investigating their attitudes towards these different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. The third section included items exploring the attitudes and beliefs of participants about English, ELF, ELF communication, and identity. The last and the fourth section included questions related to demographics, and it consisted of five different subsections: age, gender, home country, department, and proficiency level in the student survey; and for teachers, the subsections were age, gender, home country, years of teaching experience and professional qualifications. In accordance with the quantitative non-experimental research design, SPSS v.25 was utilized to analyse the data collected from the survey.

This chapter puts forth the findings on the perceptions of English instructors and students on ELF and their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. The detailed analyses of the quantitative data will be discussed under the sub-sections presented below.

# What Are the Perceptions of English Language Instructors towards ELF and to What Extent Are They Aware of the Concept of ELF?

To be able to answer the first research question, frequency analysis was used, and English instructors' perceptions of ELF and levels of awareness about ELF were explored (see Table 5). Based on the findings of the analysis, the majority of the instructors thought that there was a standard English $( 5 9 \% )$ and British English $( 6 0 . 8 \% )$ was considered as standard English. However, the majority of instructors stated that they used American accent $( 4 4 . 8 \% )$ while speaking English and that they were satisfied with their accents $( 6 9 . 2 \% )$ .

While more than half of the instructors thought that accent was important $( 5 2 . 6 \% )$ , they also stated that it was not important for the students/learners to have a native-like accent $( 6 1 . 5 \% )$ . On the other hand, almost all instructors disagreed with the item that “the widespread use of English (in every field) should be prevented” $( 9 2 . 2 \% )$ .

As for the item “Choosing the topics among the cultural aspects that I belong to makes me feel confident in speaking English,” there was almost $50 \%$ agreement. Regarding ELF, the majority of instructors stated that ELF was included in the undergraduate programs they graduated from $( 5 1 . 3 \% )$ and stated that ELF should be included in the program $( 7 8 . 7 \% )$ (See Table 5).

# What Are the Perceptions of Students towards ELF and to What Extent Are They Aware of the Concept of ELF?

To be able to answer the second research question, frequency analysis was used, and English students' perceptions of ELF and levels of awareness about ELF were explored (see Table 6). The results of the analysis showed that most students accepted the existence of a standard English $( 8 1 . 3 \% )$ . British English $( 4 7 . 7 \% )$ and American English $( 4 3 . 7 \% )$ were mostly considered as standard English. On the other hand, students stated that they generally used Turkish accent when speaking English $( 4 7 . 7 \% )$ and were generally not satisfied with their accents $( 6 2 . 1 \% )$ . Regarding the importance of the accent, the vast majority of students considered the accent as being important $( 8 9 . 3 \% )$ and, unlike the instructors; they thought it was important to have a native-like accent $( 7 9 \% )$ . Students disagreed with the statement “the widespread use of English (in every field) should be prevented” similar to the instructors $( 7 9 \% )$ . It can be said that students mostly agreed with $( 8 5 . 4 \% )$ the item of “Choosing the topics among the cultural aspects that I belong to makes me feel confident in speaking English.” (See Table 6).

# Who Do English Language Instructors Consider the Owner of the English Language?

Descriptive statistics were used to determine the evaluations of English instructors on who they considered as the owner of the English language (Table 7). The results showed that the instructors considered native speakers as the owner of the English language, regardless of nation ( $M = 1 . 7 6$ ; $S D = 1 . 1 9$ ). This is followed by “Those whose mother tongue is another language, but have grown up using English as well (i.e. they’re bilinguals)” $M = 2 . 7 4$ ; $S D = 0 . 9 7$ ); “Anyone fluent enough to speak the language without major problems” $M = 2 . 8 5$ ; $S D = 0 . 8 4$ ) and “Anyone who attempts to speak the language (independently of problems)” $\mathrm { \mathit { M } } = 3 . 6 9$ ; $S D =$ 0.96), respectively. However, it seems that the portion of the option “no one” was very small $M = 3 . 9 6$ ; $S D = 1 . 7 5$ ) (See Table 7).

# Who Do the Students Consider the Owner of the English Language?

Descriptive statistics were used to determine the evaluations of English prep school students on who they considered as the owner of the English language (Table 8). The results showed that students considered native speakers as the owner of English language, regardless of nation, at similar levels with English instructors (M $= 1 . 4 3$ ; $S D = 0 . 8 6$ ). This perception is followed by the option “Those whose mother tongue is another language, but have grown up using English as well (i.e. they’re bilinguals)” $M = 2 . 3 0$ ; $S D = 0 . 7 4$ ); “Anyone fluent enough to speak the language without major problems” $M = 2 . 7 4$ ; $S D = 0 . 8 1$ ), and “Anyone who attempts to speak the language (independently of problems)” $( M = 3 . 8 8 ; S D = 0 . 6 3 )$ respectively. However, it can be observed that students did not choose the “no one” option much ( $M = 4 . 8 5$ ; $S D = 1 . 0 7 $ ) (See Table 8).

What Beliefs about and Attitudes towards Native and Non-Native Accents of English (i.e. American English, British English, Spanish English, and Turkish English) Do English Language Instructors and Students Have?

In order to determine English language instructors’ and students’ beliefs about and attitudes towards native and non-native accents of English (i.e., American English, British English, Spanish English, and Turkish English), descriptive statistics was used. The results obtained from the analysis for both instructors and students are separately presented below.

English language instructors’ beliefs about and attitudes towards native and non-native accents of English. The results obtained from the analysis indicated that regarding their attitudes towards different accents, the instructors liked the American accent more ( $M = 4 . 1 4$ ; $S D = 0 . 6 2$ ) and they liked the Spanish accent the least $M = 2 . 4 0$ ; $S D = 0 . 8 1$ ) (Table 9). On the other hand, the results were similar in terms of the attitudes of the participants towards the speaker’s personality traits.

Namely, the instructors had more positive attitudes towards the speaker with the American accent $M = 3 . 8 1$ ; $S D = 0 . 5 8$ ), while more negative attitudes towards the speaker with the Spanish accent $M = 2 . 9 1$ ; $S D = 0 . 6 2$ ). It can be stated that the attitudes towards British and Turkish accents were alike (See Table 9).

EFL students’ beliefs about and attitudes towards native and non-native accents of English. As a result of the analysis, regarding the attitudes of the students towards different accents, it was determined that the students, similar to the English instructors, liked the American accent more $M = 4 . 1 2$ ; $S D = 0 . 5 9$ ) and the Spanish accent less ( $M = 1 . 8 9$ ; $S D = 0 . 8 1$ ) (see Table 10). Moreover, the students' results were similar to the English instructors regarding their attitudes towards the speaker’s personality traits. In other words, while the students had more positive attitudes towards the speaker using the American accent $M = 3 . 7 6$ ; $S D = 0 . 5 1$ ), they had more negative attitudes towards the speaker using the Spanish accent $M = 2 . 3 2$ ; $S D =$ 0.85). It is seen that the attitudes towards British and Turkish accents were approximately in a similar vein (See Table 10).

# Do the Attitudes of English Instructors towards Different Accents and the Speaker’s Personality Traits Differ Significantly Based on Their Perceptions and Awareness of ELF?

To be able to determine if the attitudes of English instructors towards different accents and the speaker's personality traits differed significantly based on their perceptions and awareness of ELF, independent samples t-test and One-Way

ANOVA statistics were applied. However, since these statistical tests require the assumption of normal distribution of the variables to be used in the test, the normal distribution assumption for English instructors' attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits variables was checked (Knapp, 2018). In this context, skewness and kurtosis values were examined in accordance with the approach proposed by Sposito, Hand, and Skarpness (1983). When the skewness or kurtosis value (s) is above $( + / - )$ 2.2, it can be stated that the item or items with this value cause problems for univariate normality assumption (Sposito et al., 1983). Therefore, those that exceed the recommended cutoff value should be removed from the analysis within the scope of the univariate normality assumption. Then, the data is considered to provide univariate normality with the remaining items. As can be seen in Appendix F, the skewness and kurtosis values obtained for attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits variables were not above the recommended cutoff value.

In addition, these variables were slightly skewed and kurtotic. Therefore, the data were normally distributed in terms of skewness and kurtosis. On the other hand, the assumption of homogeneity of the variances related to independent samples t-test and One-Way ANOVA was checked by evaluating the significance of the Levene’s test. In this context, for the independent samples $\mathrm { t }$ -test, the significance of the “equal variances assumed” option was used in the homogenously distributed variances $( p >$ .05), while the significance of the “equal variances not assumed” option was examined in the non-homogenously distributed variances $( p < . 0 5 )$ (Knapp, 2018). While evaluating ANOVA statistics in homogenously distributed variances $( p > . 0 5 )$ for One-Way ANOVA, the significance of Brown-Forsythe statistics was examined in non-homogeneous variances $( p < . 0 5 )$ (Pallant, 2010). Results regarding the homogeneous distribution of variances are shared in Appendix G.

Regarding the effect size of the differences obtained from the analyses, eta squared and Cohen’s $d$ statistics were utilized. A statistically significant outcome does not give information about the strength or size of the outcome. Therefore, it is important to know, in addition to information on statistical significance, the size of the effect. Effect size is defined as the magnitude of the difference between levels of the independent variable with respect to the dependent variable (Morgan, Leech, Gloeckner, & Barrett, 2013).

There are a number of different effect size statistics. The most commonly used ones to compare groups are partial eta squared (for ANOVA family) and Cohen’s d (for t-test family). Partial eta squared effect size statistics indicate the proportion of variance of the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable. Values can range from 0 to 1. Cohen’s $d$ , on the other hand, presents difference between groups in terms of standard deviation units. To interpret the strength of the different effect size statistics, the following guidelines were proposed by Cohen (1988) when assessing research involving the comparison of different groups (see Table 11). Lastly, if there were two or more different accents with significant differences, Pearson Correlation Analysis was performed to determine whether the attitudes towards these accents and the attitudes towards the speaker were related, and if so, what the level of this relationship was. Pearson correlation analysis is an analysis method used to determine the level of the relationship between two or more continues variables. The correlation coefficient calculated as a result of this analysis is shown with $r$ , and it takes a value between $^ { - 1 }$ and $+ 1$ . The value of $+ 1$ indicates that there is a positive and very high relationship between the two variables.

On the other hand, -1 indicates that there is a very high but negative relationship between the two variables. If this coefficient is 0, it means that there is no significant relationship between the two variables. The absolute value of the correlation coefficient can be defined as high between 0.70 -1.00, medium between 0.70-0.30 and low between 0.30-0.00 (Pallant, 2010). The results obtained from the analyses and the evaluations are presented in the following subsections:

Difference between the instructors who believed there was a standard English and those who did not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. Independent samples t-test was conducted to find out if there was a statistically significant difference between the instructors who believed there was a standard English and those who did not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speakers of these accents. The results showed that there was not a statistically significant difference between two groups $( p > . 0 5 )$ . When the average scores were analyzed, it was observed that the two groups’ attitudes towards different accents and the speakers of these accents were alike (See Appendix H).

Difference among instructor groups based on their opinions about the existence of standard English regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. One-Way ANOVA test was conducted to find out if there was a statistically significant difference among English instructor groups based on their evaluation of standard English. According to the results, there was not a statistically significant difference among different groups based on their evaluation of standard English regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speakers of these accents $( p > . 0 5 )$ . Therefore, whether they chose American, British or other option for standard English, their attitudes towards different accents and the speakers of these accents were alike (See Appendix H).

Difference among instructor groups based on the accent they used while speaking English regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. One-Way ANOVA test was conducted to find out if there was a statistically significant difference among the instructors who used different accents while speaking English regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. Consequently, there was not a statistically significant difference among different groups using different accents regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speakers of these accents $( p > . 0 5 )$ . Based on this, regardless of which accent was used in speech, attitudes towards accents and the speaker did not change (See Appendix H).

Difference between the instructors who were satisfied with their accent and those who were not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. Independent samples t-test was conducted to find out if there was a statistically significant difference between the instructors who were satisfied with their accents and those who were not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. The results showed that there was not a statistically significant difference between the two groups $( p > . 0 5 )$ . When the average scores of both groups were examined, it was observed that their attitudes towards American, English, Spanish and Turkish accents and attitudes towards the speaker were alike (See Appendix H).

Difference between the instructors who thought accent was important and those who did not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. Independent samples t-test was conducted to find out if there was a statistically significant difference between the instructors, who thought accent was important and those who did not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. According to the results, there was a statistically significant difference only in Spanish accent $( t ( 7 6 ) = - 2 . 5 2 , p =$ .014, $d = 0 . 6$ ) and Turkish accent $( t ( 7 6 ) = - 3 . 8 9 , p < . 0 0 1 , d = 0 . 9$ ) regarding their attitudes towards different accents. On the other hand, there was not any statistically significant difference in American and British accents $( p > . 0 5 )$ . As can be seen in Table 12, regarding Spanish accent, the instructors who stated the accent was not important for them $M = 2 . 6 9$ ; $S D = 0 . 8 2$ ), had a more positive attitude compared to the instructors who said it was important $M = 2 . 1 9$ ; $S D = 0 . 7 4$ ). Similarly, it can be stated that in Turkish accent, the instructors who said that accent was not important for them $\mathit { M } = 3 . 8 2$ ; $S D = 0 . 5 9$ ) had a more positive attitude compared to the instructors who said it was important ( $M = 3 . 2 1$ ; $S D = 0 . 7 6$ ). While the effect size of the differences that are obtained can said to be large as a whole, it can be stated that the effect size for the difference in the attitude towards Turkish accent is higher than that of the Spanish accent.

Moreover, whether there was a statistically significant relationship between the attitudes towards Spanish accent and the Turkish accent was checked, and for this, Pearson correlation analysis was conducted. As a result of the analysis, it was revealed that there was a statistically significant, linear and medium level

relationship between the attitudes towards Spanish accent and Turkish accent $( r =$ .41; $p < . 0 1 $ ). As such, it can be concluded that if the positive attitude towards the Spanish accent increases or decreases, the same will be valid for the Turkish accent as well (See Table 12).

As for English instructors’ attitudes towards speaker’s personality traits, there was a statistically significant difference in the American accent $( t ( 7 6 ) = 2 . 0 0 , p =$ .049, $d = 0 . 4$ ). However, there was not a statistically significant difference in British, Spanish, and Turkish accents $( p > . 0 5 )$ . The instructors who said that accent was important to them $\mathit { M } = 3 . 9 3$ ; $S D = 0 . 5 5$ ) had more positive attitudes towards the speaker’s personality traits in American accent than those who said it was not important $M = 3 . 6 8$ ; $S D = 0 . 6 0$ ). It can be stated that this difference is relatively medium in terms of effect size (See Table 13).

Difference between the instructors who thought it was important for their learners to acquire a native-like accent and those who did not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. Independent samples t-test was conducted to find out if there was a statistically significant difference between the instructors, who thought it was important for their learners to acquire a native-like accent and those who did not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. According to the results, there was a statistically significant difference only in British accent (t(76) $= - 3 . 0 4 , p < . 0 1$ , $d = 0 . 7$ ). However, there was not a statistically significant difference in American, British, and Spanish accents $( p > . 0 5 )$ . Based on this, those who thought that it was not important for their learners to acquire a native-like accent (M $= 3 . 6 9$ ; $S D = 0 . 6 7$ ) could be considered to have a more positive attitude than those who thought it was important $M = 3 . 1 9$ ; $S D = 0 . 7 6$ ). This difference has a large effect size (Table 14).

On the other hand, there was not a statistically significant difference between the instructors who thought it was important for their learners to acquire a native-like accent and those who did not regarding their attitudes towards the speaker’s personality traits $( p > . 0 5 )$ (See Table 14).

Difference between the instructors who agreed that the widespread use of English (in every field) should be prevented and those who did not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. Independent samples t-test was conducted to find out if there was a statistically significant difference between the instructors who agreed that the widespread use of English (in every field) should be prevented and those who did not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. After the analysis, it was concluded that there was not a statistically significant difference between the two groups. $( p > . 0 5 )$ . When the average scores of the instructors who agreed and who did not agree were examined, it was revealed that attitudes towards American, British, Spanish and Turkish accents and attitudes towards the speaker were alike (See Appendix H).

Difference between the instructors who agreed that in English language teaching, choosing the topics among the cultural aspects that they belonged to made them feel confident in speaking English and those who did not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. Independent samples t-test was conducted to find out if there was a statistically significant difference between the instructors who agreed with the given prompt in this item and those who did not agree regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. It was found that there was not a statistically significant difference between the two groups $( p > . 0 5 )$ . When the average scores of the instructors who agreed and who did not agree were examined, it was revealed that the two groups’ attitudes towards American, British, Spanish and Turkish accents and the speakers of these accents were alike (See Appendix H).

Difference among instructor groups based on the inclusion of ELF in the program they graduated from regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. One-Way ANOVA test was conducted to find out if there was a statistically significant difference among the instructors who answered as yes, no or I do not know to the question on the inclusion of ELF regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. Consequently, there was not a statistically significant difference among the different groups $( p > . 0 5 )$ . Based on this, whether or not ELF was covered in the program they graduated from did not change the instructors’ attitudes towards different accents and the speakers of these accents (See Appendix H).

Difference between the instructors who thought ELF should be included in the program and those who did not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. Independent samples t-test was conducted to find out if there was a statistically significant difference between the instructors, who thought ELF should be included in the program and those who thought the opposite regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. According to the results, there was a statistically significant difference only in American accent $( t ( 7 3 ) = 2 . 5 , p = . 0 1 5 , d = ($ $d = 0 . 7$ ). It can be evaluated that instructors who said yes $M = 3 . 9 1$ ; $S D = 0 . 5 5$ ) had a more positive attitude towards different accents than those who said no $M = 3 . 5 1$ ; $S D = 0 . 6 0$ ). This difference can be said to have a large level of effect in terms of effect size (See Table 15).

# Do the Students’ Attitudes towards Different Accents and the Speaker’s Personality Traits Differ Significantly Based on Their Perceptions and

# Awareness of ELF?

Independent samples t-test and One-Way ANOVA statistics were utilized to determine whether the students' attitudes towards different accents and the speaker's personality traits differed significantly based on their perceptions and awareness of ELF. Before the analyses were carried out, the assumption of normality was checked (Knapp, 2018), and it was observed that there was no skewness and kurtosis value above 2.2 in the variables under question (Sposito, Hand, & Skarpness, 1983). Furthermore, the mentioned variables were skewed and kurtotic at a minimum level. Therefore, the assumption of normality was met (see Appendix I).

On the other hand, the assumption of homogeneity for the variances related to independent samples t-test and One-Way ANOVA was checked by evaluating the significance of the Levene’s test. In this regard, for the independent samples t-test, the significance of the “equal variances assumed” option was used in the homogenously distributed variances $( p > . 0 5 )$ , while the significance of the “equal variances not assumed” option was examined in the non-homogenously distributed variances $( p < . 0 5 )$ (Knapp, 2018, p. 86).

For One-Way ANOVA, while ANOVA statistics were utilized in homogenously distributed variances $( p > . 0 5 )$ , the significance of Brown-Forsythe statistics was checked in non-homogeneous variances $( p < . 0 5 )$ (Pallant, 2010). Results regarding the homogeneous distribution of variances are presented in Appendix J. As for the effect size of the differences obtained from the analyses, eta squared was used for the results of One-Way ANOVA and Cohen’s $d$ was used for the results of Independent Sample t-Test (Morgan et al., 2011). Lastly, in the case of two or more different accents with significant differences, Pearson Correlation Analysis was carried out to determine whether the attitudes towards these accents and the attitudes towards the speaker were related, and if so, what the level of this relationship was (Pallant, 2010). The results obtained from the analyses and the evaluations related to the results are presented in the following subsections.

Difference between the students who believed there was a standard English and those who did not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. Independent samples t-test was conducted to find out if there was a statistically significant difference between the students who believed a standard English existed and those who did not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. There was a statistically significantly difference only in American accent $( t ( 2 1 2 ) = - 2 . 1 0 , p$ $= . 0 3 7 , d = 0 . 4 )$ . The students who believed that there was a standard English $M =$ 4.07; $S D = 0 . 6 1$ ) had a more positive attitude towards American accent than the students who thought the opposite $M = 4 . 2 9$ ; $S D = 0 . 4 6$ ) (Table 16). It is seen that the effect size related to this difference is relatively medium. However, there was not any statistically significant difference regarding the attitudes towards the speaker’s personality traits between the students who believed a standard English existed and those who did not $( p > . 0 5 )$ (See Table 16).

Difference among student groups based on their opinions about the existence of standard English regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. One-Way ANOVA test was conducted to find out if there was a statistically significant difference among student groups based on their evaluation of standard English regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speakers of these accents. According to the results, there was not a statistically significant difference among different groups $( p > . 0 5 )$ . Therefore, whether they chose American, British or other option for standard English, their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits were alike (See Appendix K).

Difference among student groups based on the accent they used while speaking English regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. One-Way ANOVA test was conducted to find out if there was a statistically significant difference among the students who used different accents while speaking English regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. Consequently, there was not a statistically significant difference among the different groups $( p > . 0 5 )$ . Based on this, it can be said that regardless of which accent was used speech, attitudes towards accents and the speakers of these accents did not change (See Appendix K).

Difference between the students who were satisfied with their accent and those who were not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. Independent samples t-test was conducted to find out if there was a statistically significant difference between the students who were satisfied with their accent and those who were not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. The results showed that there was not a statistically significant difference between the two groups $( p > . 0 5 )$ . When the average scores of both groups were examined, it was observed that their attitudes towards American, British, Spanish and Turkish accents and the speakers of these accents were alike (See Appendix K).

Difference between the students who thought accent was important and those who did not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. Independent samples t-test was conducted to find out if there was a statistically significant difference between the students who thought accent was important and those who did not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. According to the results, there was not a statistically significantly difference between the two groups regarding their attitudes towards different accents $( p > . 0 5 )$ . On the other hand, regarding their attitudes towards the speaker’s personality traits, there was a statistically significantly difference only in American accent $( t ( 2 1 2 ) = 2 . 3 4 , p = . 0 2 0 , d = 0 . 5 $ ). The students who thought accent was important $M = 3 . 7 8$ ; $S D = 0 . 5 6$ ) had a more positive attitude towards the speaker’s personality traits in American accent than the students who thought on the contrary ( $M = 3 . 5 0$ ; $S D = 0 . 5 2$ ). The effect size for this difference is medium (See Table 17).

Difference between the students who thought it was important for them to acquire a native-like accent and those who did not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. Independent samples t-test was conducted to find out if there was a statistically significant difference between the students who thought it was important for them to acquire a native-like accent and those who did not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. Consequently, there was not a statistically significant difference between the two groups $( p > . 0 5 )$ . When the average scores of two groups were examined, it was observed that their attitudes towards American, British, Spanish and Turkish accents and the speaker’s personality traits were alike (See Appendix L).

Difference between the students who agreed that the widespread use of English (in every field) should be prevented and those who did not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. Independent samples t-test was conducted to find out if there was a statistically significant difference between the students who believed that the widespread use of English (in every field) should be prevented and those who did not regarding their attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits. As a consequence, regarding the attitudes towards different accents, there was a statistically significant difference only in British accent $( t ( 2 0 8 ) = - 2 . 5 0 , p = . 0 1 3 ,$ $d =$

It can be said that the students who agreed with this statement $\mathbf { \mathit { M } } = 3 . 3 2$ ; $S D =$ 0.90) had a more negative attitude towards different accents than those who did not $\mathbf { \mathit { M } } = 3 . 6 8$ ; $S D = 0 . 8 3$ ). The effect size of this difference can be said to be relatively medium (Table 18). However, there was not a statistically significant difference between two groups regarding their attitudes towards the speaker’s personality traits $( p > . 0 5 )$ (See Table 18).

# Do Beliefs and Attitudes towards Different English Accents Differ Significantly Depending on Being an English Instructor or Student?

Independent samples t-test was utilized to determine whether the attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits differed significantly depending on being an English instructor or student. The assumption of homogeneity for the variances related to independent samples t-test was checked by evaluating the significance of the Levene’s test (Appendix L). While the significance of the “equal variances assumed” option is used in homogenously distributed variances $( p > . 0 5 )$ , the significance of the “equal variances not assumed” in non-homogeneous variances $( p < . 0 5 )$ is examined (Knapp, 2018, p. 86). As for the effect size of the differences obtained from the test, Cohen’s $d$ was used (Morgan et al 2013). Lastly, in the case of two or more different accents with significant differences, Pearson Correlation Analysis was carried out to determine whether the attitudes towards these accents and the attitudes towards the speaker were related, and if so, what the level of this relationship was (Pallant, 2010).

Regarding the attitudes towards different accents, there was a significant difference between the instructors and students in British $( t ( 1 7 1 . 8 7 ) = 3 . 8 9 , p < . 0 0 1 $ , $d = 0 . 4 9$ ) and Spanish $( t ( 2 9 0 ) = 4 . 7 3 , p < . 0 0 1$ , $d = 0 . 6 2 )$ ) accents. For American and Turkish accents, no significant difference was observed $( p { > } . 0 5 )$ . English instructors $\mathrm { \mathit { M } } = 3 . 9 8$ ; $S D = 0 . 6 7$ ) had a more positive attitude towards British accent when compared to the students $( M = 3 . 6 1 ; S D = 0 . 8 5 )$ .

In a similar vein, the instructors ( $M = 2 . 4 0$ ; $S D = 0 . 8 0$ ) can be said to have a more positive attitude towards Spanish accent when compared to students $M = 1 . 8 9$ ; $S D = 0 . 8 0$ ). However, this attitude was more positive in British accent. While these differences in the attitudes towards British and Spanish accents may have a medium effect size, the difference in Spanish accent has a larger effect size (See Table 19).

Moreover, whether there was a significant relationship between the attitudes towards British accent and Spanish accent was also examined and Pearson correlation analysis was carried out in this context. As a result of the analysis, it was found that there was a statistically significant, linear and low level relationship between the attitudes towards British accent and Spanish accent $( r = . 2 0 , p < . 0 1 )$ ). Hence, it can be concluded that as the positive attitude towards British accent increases or decreases, the same will be valid for Spanish accent.

On the other hand, it was determined that there was a significant difference in Spanish accent regarding the attitudes towards the speaker’s personality traits $( t ( 1 8 6 . 2 2 5 ) = 6 . 4 9 , p < . 0 0 1$ , $d = 0 . 8$ ). However, for American, British and Turkish accents, no significant difference between the instructors’ attitudes and students’ attitudes was observed $( p > . 0 5 )$ . Within this context, English instructors $M = 2 . 9 1$ ; $S D = 0 . 6 2 )$ had a more positive attitude towards the speaker’s personality traits in Spanish accent than students ( $M = 2 . 3 1$ ; $S D = 0 . 8 5$ ) when means were examined. The effect size of the difference was large (See Table 20).

# Is There any Statistically Significant Difference Between English Instructors and Students in terms of the Variables Below?

i) emotional beliefs about English   
ii) functional beliefs about English   
iii) attitudes towards English pronunciation   
iv) beliefs about the speaker’s own competence   
v) attitudes towards ELF   
vi) attitudes towards ELF communication   
vii) the speaker’s identity   
viii) language anxiety

Independent samples t-test was utilized to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference between the English instructors and students in terms of variables given above instead of using constructs’ composite scores. Before the analyses were carried out, the assumption of normality was checked (Knapp, 2018), and it was observed that there were only two items (31. English is one of the most important languages in today's world; 34. Learning English is a waste of time) which had skewness and kurtosis value above 2.2 threshold (Sposito et al., 1983). Other items were lower than the threshold value. In this context, another approach provided by Pallant (2010) was applied. In this approach, first, the outliers that the items have through boxplots are examined, and then the average of these outliers and the $5 \%$ trimmed mean after they are removed are examined. If the difference between the normal average and the cropped average (i.e., $5 \%$ trimmed mean) is too high here, it is decided that the related items are not distributed normally.

Based on this approach, the examination of the boxplots revealed that the items exhibited between four and five outliers. Next, the means and the $5 \%$ trimmed means were examined to determine whether these items should be treated as extreme scores. Using the $5 \%$ trimmed mean technique, extreme scores, which have a strong influence on the mean, can be detected (Pallant, 2010). Consequently, it was found that the items’ mean differences were minimum 0.9 and maximum 0.11. Therefore, the assumption of normality was met (see Appendix M).The assumption of homogeneity for the variances related to independent samples t-test was checked by evaluating the significance of the Levene’s test (Appendix N). While the significance of the “equal variances assumed” option is used in homogenously distributed variances $( p > . 0 5 )$ , the significance of the “equal variances not assumed” in non-homogeneous variances $( p < . 0 5 )$ is examined (Knapp, 2018, p. 86). As for the effect size of the differences obtained from the test, Cohen’s $d$ was used (Morgan et al., 2011). The results obtained from the analyses and the evaluations related to the results are presented in the following subsections.

Emotional beliefs about English. When the instructors and students’ emotional beliefs about English were examined, it was concluded that majority of both the instructors and students agreed with the item “English is a beautiful language (item 11). Similarly, they generally agreed with the item “English is one of the most important languages in today’s world (item 31). In addition to these findings, independent samples t-test was applied to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference between the instructors and students regarding

emotional beliefs about English, and it was determined that there was no significant difference in item 11 and item 31 $( p > . 0 5 )$ . Therefore, it can be evaluated that teachers and students' emotional beliefs about English were at alike (See Table 21).

Functional beliefs about English. The descriptive statistics in Table 22 showed that while more instructors agreed with the item “In today’s world, one cannot get by without knowing English (item 1), the students can be said to be neutral towards this item. Moreover, while both the instructors and students agreed with the item “English should be an obligatory subject at university (item 4) at similar levels, for the item “Correct grammar is important for me to communicate with foreigners in English” (item 30), it can be said that more students agreed than instructors.

In addition to these findings, the results of the independent samples t-test showed that the instructors $M = 3 . 7 6$ ; $S D = 1 . 0 0$ ) agreed $( t ( 1 6 4 . 0 8 ) = 3 . 8 9 ; p < . 0 0 1$ ; $d = 0 . 4 9$ ) with the item “In today’s world, one cannot get by without knowing English.” more than the students ( $M = 3 . 2 1$ ; $S D = 1 . 2 2$ ). The effect size for the difference obtained can be said to be relatively moderate. However, the students $M$ $= 3 . 7 9$ ; $S D = 0 . 9 5$ ) thought that correct grammar was important for them to communicate with foreigners in English $( t ( 2 9 0 ) = - 2 . 2 8 ; p < . 0 5$ ; $d = 0 . 2 9$ ) more than the instructors $\mathit { M } = 3 . 5 0$ ; $S D = 1 . 0 2 $ ). The effect size for the difference is small. On the other hand, the students did not think that learning English was a waste of time (item 34) and they thought that English was important for their career (item 23) (See Table 23).

Attitudes towards English pronunciation. When the descriptive statistics in Table 24 are examined, it is observed that almost $3 6 \%$ of the instructors did not agree with the item, “It is important to speak English with an excellent pronunciation.” For the same item, $21 \%$ of the students did not agree while $45 \%$ of them agreed. While only $2 . 6 \%$ of the instructors did not agree with the item “I am happy with my English pronunciation as long as people can understand me,” $14 \%$ of the students did not agree. On the other hand, although the instructors $( 8 4 . 7 \% )$ had a majority in terms of the percentages compared to the students $( 6 0 . 7 \% )$ , when the percentages were examined, it was understood that both the instructors and students were pleased with their pronunciation insomuch as they could be understood. For the item “I do not think it is important to speak like a native English speaker,” the students $( 4 2 . 6 \% )$ did not agree as much as the instructors $( 6 2 . 8 \% )$ . On the other hand, for the item “You should not say anything in English until you can speak English correctly,” both the instructors $( 8 5 . 9 \% )$ and the students (82.7) expressed similar levels of agreement. In addition to these findings, independent samples t-test was carried out to see if these items differed significantly between the instructors and students. The results obtained showed that for the item “It is important to speak English with an excellent pronunciation,” fewer instructors $M = 2 . 8 5$ ; $S D = 1 . 0 8$ ) thought it was important

while more students ( $M = 3 . 3 6$ ; $S D = 1 . 1 2$ ) thought it was important $( t ( 2 9 0 ) = - 3 . 5 3$ ; $p < . 0 0 1 ; d = 0 . 4 6 ) .$

Similarly, related to the item “I do not think it is important to speak like a native English speaker,” more teachers $\mathrm { \Delta } M = 3 . 6 8$ ; $S D = 1 . 0 1$ ) thought it was not important to speak like a native English speaker $( t ( 2 9 0 ) = 3 . 1 5 ; p < . 0 1$ ; $d = 0 . 4 3 )$ when compared to the students ( $M = 3 . 2 2$ ; $S D = 1 . 1 2 )$ ). There was no significant difference found between the instructors and students on the item “You should not say anything in English until you can speak English correctly” $( p > . 0 5 )$ . When the effect sizes are evaluated, it can be stated that the 12th item has a medium effect level and the $8 ^ { \mathrm { t h } }$ and $2 2 ^ { \mathrm { n d } }$ items have a low effect size (See Table 25).

Beliefs about the speaker’s own competence. When the descriptive statistics in Table 26 were examined, it could be observed that while the majority of the instructors $( 7 9 . 5 \% )$ agreed with the item “I am happy with my present English pronunciation,” the majority of the students $( 4 7 . 6 \% )$ did not agree with it. Hence, it can be concluded that the students were not happy with their pronunciation. On the other hand, while the majority of the students $( 7 5 . 2 \% )$ agreed with the item “I find it easier to read English than to speak English,” the instructors $( 3 2 . 2 \% )$ were generally undecided about it. Again, it can be said that the majority of the students $( 6 3 . 6 \% )$ thought they would never be able to speak English with a correct pronunciation.

In addition to these findings, to be able to determine if there was a statistically significant difference between the instructors and the students on the related items, independent samples t-test was carried out. The results showed that the instructors $M = 4 . 0 0$ ; $S D = 0 . 8 5$ ) were more pleased with their pronunciation (item 6) than the students $( M = 2 . 6 2 ; S D = 1 . 0 3 ) ( t ( 1 6 4 . 0 3 ) = 1 1 . 5 3 ; p < . 0 0 1 ; d = 1 . 4 6 ) .$ On the other hand, the students $M = 4 . 0 0$ ; $S D = 0 . 8 5$ ) found reading in English easier than speaking in English (item 21) when compared to the instructors $M =$ 4.00; $S D = 0 . 8 5$ ) $( t ( 2 9 0 ) = - 6 . 6 9$ ; $p < . 0 0 1$ ; $d = 0 . 8 8$ ). In terms of effect size, the significant differences obtained have high levels size effect for both items (See Table 27).

Attitudes towards ELF. The descriptive statistics in Table 28 showed that fregarding the item “Schools should teach English not as the native speakers speak it, but for efficient international communication,” teachers $( 8 2 \% )$ and students $( 7 2 . 9 \% )$ agreed at approximately similar levels. Similarly, both the instructors $( 6 7 . 7 \% )$ and the students $( 6 4 . 1 \% )$ agreed with the item “English does not belong to the native speakers anymore, but to anybody who uses it” at similar levels. This could well indicate that both the instructors and the students held positive attitudes towards the use of English as ELF. In parallel with this finding, the instructors $( 5 3 . 9 \% )$ and the students $( 5 6 . 1 \% )$ had similar attitudes towards the item “I would prefer it if the international language of communication were not English but my native language.”

More students $( 5 5 . 1 \% )$ agreed with the item “It is valuable for me if someone has the pronunciation of a native English speaker” when compared to the instructors $( 4 6 . 2 \% )$ . Moreover, both the instructors $( 4 8 . 7 \% )$ and the students $( 4 9 . 1 \% )$ agreed with the item “Everybody in Turkey should speak English since this would facilitate worldwide communication” at similar levels. Yet, the instructors were generally undecided $( 4 2 . 3 \% )$ about the item “It would be better if people on international conferences would not only speak English but other languages as well, such as my native language.”

The majority of both the instructors $( 8 3 . 3 \% )$ and the students $( 8 4 . 6 \% )$ agreed with the item “It is a good thing that so many people speak English as it allows for easier communication among people.” This result could again indicate the positive attitudes of both groups of participants towards the communicative role of ELF throughout the world. As for the item “We need to develop a global variety of English that is not linked to a particular English speaking country and that can be

used everywhere,” more instructors $( 4 8 . 7 \% )$ agreed with it when compared to the students $( 3 2 . 2 \% )$ .

At the same time, independent samples t-test was conducted to determine if the relevant items differed significantly between the instructors and the students. The results confirmed that there was a statistically significant difference between the instructors and the students only in item 16 $( t ( 2 9 0 ) = - 2 . 0 6 ; p < . 0 5$ ; $d = 0 . 3 8$ ) and item 28 $( t ( 2 9 0 ) = 3 . 2 2 ; p < . 0 1$ ; $d = 0 . 4 5$ ). In this context, while it can be concluded that the students $( M = 3 . 5 5 ; S D = 1 . 0 7 )$ paid more attention to pronunciation than the instructors $M = 3 . 2 6$ ; $S D = 1 . 0 5$ ) (item 16), the instructors $M = 3 . 5 1$ ; $S D = 0 . 8 5$ ) were more positive about developing a one-for-all global variety than the students $M$ $= 3 . 0 7$ ; $S D = 1 . 0 9$ ) (Table 29). When the effect sizes of the significant differences obtained are evaluated, it can be stated that item 16 and item 28 have a medium effect size (See Table 29).

Attitudes towards ELF communication. When the descriptive statistics in Table 30 were examined, it was observed that the instructors $( 5 2 . 6 \% )$ and the students $( 5 8 . 9 \% )$ generally agreed with the item “I am not bothered about mistakes that other English learners make as long as I understand what they want to say.” This specific finding could again indicate the participants’ positive attitudes towards the communicative function of ELF, rather than accuracy. Yet, while the majority of the students $( 4 6 . 8 \% )$ agreed with the item “Sometimes, I find it funny when people speak English with a strong non-English accent,” the instructors $( 3 4 . 8 \% )$ did not agree with it.

Both the instructors $( 4 4 . 9 \% )$ and the students $( 5 7 . 9 \% )$ generally agreed with the item “A strong non-English accent complicates communication among people.” An independent samples t-test was conducted to determine if the relevant items differed significantly between the instructors and the students. The results showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the instructors and the students in item 20 $( t ( 1 6 6 . 7 5 ) = - 3 . 1 0 ; p < . 0 1$ ; $d = 0 . 3 9 ,$ ) and item 26 $( t ( 2 9 0 ) = - 3 . 1 1$ ; $p < . 0 1$ ; $d = 0 . 3 9$ ). However, there was no significant difference for item 14 $( p > . 0 5 )$

In this context, it can be concluded that the students $( M = 3 . 3 6 ; S D = 1 . 1 8 )$ found it funnier when people spoke English with a strong non-English accent when compared to the instructors $M = 2 . 9 4$ ; $S D = 0 . 9 6$ ). Similarly, the students $( M = 3 . 6 4$ ; $S D = 0 . 9 3$ ) could be considered as being more negative towards a strong non-English accent, posing a problem for communication when compared to the instructors $M =$ 3.26; $S D = 0 . 9 9$ ) (See Table 31).

The speaker’s identity. When the descriptive statistics in Table 32 were examined, it was observed that the instructors $( 6 0 . 2 \% )$ and the students $( 5 8 \% )$ generally did not agree with the item “To me, English is more important than my native language.” The instructors $( 7 1 . 8 \% )$ and the students $( 8 4 . 1 \% )$ generally did not also agree with the item “If one speaks English, one also has to try to behave like the natives,” with the percentage of students being slightly higher. Again, both groups $7 2 . 4 \%$ of the students and $6 9 . 2 \%$ of the teachers) did not agree that English was a threat to their native language. Yet, the instructors $( 5 9 \% )$ and the students (87.4) generally agreed that being able to speak English was important because they wanted to be able to interact more easily with native English speakers. The agreement of both groups with this item again indicates the importance of the communicative function of English language for the participants.

$1 =$ Strongly Disagree; $5 =$ Strongly Agree; ELI $=$ English Language Instructors; $\mathbf { S } \mathrm { T U } =$ Students.

Similarly, both groups (students $8 9 . 3 \%$ / teachers $8 9 . 7 \%$ ) agreed that speaking English was important to interact more easily with speakers who did not speak their language. This would again correspond to the nature of ELF usage and communication for the participants. When it comes to accent, while the majority of the instructors $( 5 7 . 7 \% )$ did not agree with the item “I do not like it when people recognize in my accent that I am not a native English speaker,” the students were $( 3 8 . 3 \% )$ somehow undecided. This could stem from the fact that the students are not confident with their use of English and may not know how to position themselves as an English speaker.

For the item “When I speak English, I feel that I am a world citizen,” there was a general agreement on part of both the instructors $( 6 6 . 6 \% )$ and the students $( 5 4 . 7 \% )$ . On the other hand, both the instructors $( 4 4 . 9 \% )$ and the students $( 6 7 . 3 \% )$ agreed that they would like to have a native-like accent. Independent samples t-test was conducted to determine if the relevant items differed significantly between the instructors and the students. The results showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the instructors and the students in item 9 $( t ( 2 9 0 ) =$ 2.51; $p < . 0 5$ ; $d = 0 . 3 2 )$ , item 17 $( t ( 1 2 1 . 3 3 ) = - 4 . 9 9$ ; $p < . 0 1 1$ ; $d = 0 . 6 8 )$ ), item 25 $( t ( 2 9 0 ) = - 3 . 3 1 ; p < . 0 1$ ; $d = 0 . 4 5$ ) and item 32 $( t ( 2 9 0 ) = - 2 . 8 6 ; p < . 0 1$ ; $d = 0 . 3 8$ ).

Yet, no statistically significant difference was observed in items 5, 13, 18 and 29. $( p > . 0 5 )$ . In accordance with this, it can be concluded that the instructors $M =$ 2.03; $S D = 1 . 0 2$ ) were more positive towards the idea of trying to behave like the natives for an English speaker when compared to the students $M = 1 . 7 0$ ; $S D = 0 . 9 8$ ) (item 9). When compared to the instructors $M = 4 . 2 2$ ; $S D = 0 . 8 0$ ), the students $( M =$ 3.63; $S D = 0 . 9 3$ ) agreed more that speaking English meant being able to interact more easily with Native speakers of English (item 17). Similarly, the students $M =$ 2.44; $S D = 0 . 9 6$ ) disliked it more when people recognized in their accent that they were not native speakers compared to the instructors ( $M = 2 . 9 0$ ; $S D = 1 . 0 8$ ) (item 25). Lastly it can be concluded that the students $\mathit { M } = 3 . 4 1$ ; $S D = 1 . 0 1$ ) wanted to have a native like accent more when compared to the instructors $\mathit { M } = 3 . 8 1$ ; $S D =$ 1.06) (item 32). The effect size values obtained were low and medium level (See Table 33).

Language anxiety. When the descriptive statistics in Table 34 were examined, it was revealed that while the majority of the instructors $( 8 0 . 8 \% )$ agreed with the item “I feel very much at ease when I have to speak English,” the students $( 4 7 . 7 \% )$ generally did not agree with it. However, it can be concluded that both the instructors (56.4) and the students (48.6) generally agreed that they felt insecure about their pronunciation while speaking in front of a group.

Independent samples t-test was conducted to determine if the relevant items differed significantly between the instructors and the students.

Yet, no significant difference was observed in item 10 $( p > . 0 5 )$ .

Thus, this difference had a high level of effect size (See Table 35).

# Conclusion

The purpose of this research study was to explore Turkish EFL instructors’ and students’ perceptions on ELF and native and non-native accents of English. The findings of the data, which was collected through an online survey, were provided in detail in this chapter. The next chapter, which is the conclusions chapter, will present the discussion of the findings, the pedagogical implications, limitations of the current study and suggestions for further research.

# CHAPTER 5: CONCLUSIONS

# Introduction

In this chapter, first, an overview of the present research study is presented. Next, the major findings about the beliefs and attitudes towards ELF and different accents and ownership of English language are discussed with reference to the relevant literature. Then, the limitations of the present study and implications for practice are discussed. Finally, possible suggestions for further research are deliberated.

# Overview of the Study

The purpose of this research study was to explore Turkish EFL instructors’ and students’ perceptions on ELF and native and non-native accents of English. The study also aimed to find out how the EFL instructors and students see the position and ownership of English as a native language and as a lingua franca all over the world and their own use of ELF. To this end, the following research questions were addressed:

1. What are the perceptions of English language instructors towards ELF and to what extent are they aware of the concept of ELF?   
2. What are the perceptions of students towards ELF and to what extent are they aware of the concept of ELF?   
3. Who do English language instructors consider the owner of the English language?   
4. Who do the students consider the owner of the English language?   
5. What beliefs about and attitudes towards native and non-native accents of English (i.e. American English, British English, Spanish English, and Turkish English) do English language instructors and students have?   
6. Do the attitudes of English instructors towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits differ significantly based on their perceptions and awareness of ELF?   
7. Do the students’ attitudes towards different accents and the speaker’s personality traits differ significantly based on their perceptions and awareness of ELF?   
8. Do beliefs and attitudes towards different English accents differ significantly depending on being an English instructor or student?   
9. Is there any statistically significant difference between English instructors and students in terms of the variables below?

i. emotional beliefs about English ii. functional beliefs about English iii. attitudes towards English pronunciation iv. beliefs about the speaker’s own competence v. attitudes towards ELF vi. attitudes towards ELF communication vii. the speaker’s identity viii. language anxiety

The data required for the study were collected via an online survey (teacher and students versions), which consisted of four sections. The first section of the survey was adapted from İnceçay and Akyel (2014) except for one item (item 9); item nine was adapted from Sifakis et al. (2005) and its aim was to look into the

participants’ perceptions of the ownership of the English language. The other items in the first section aimed to explore the perceptions of the participants about Standard English, general awareness of ELF, the participants’ own accents and different accents, the function of culture and cultural elements in teaching and learning English. In the second section of the survey, the participants listened to four fragments representing four different accents and then answered the two-part Likert scale items. This part was adopted from DeMeerleer (2012), and it was designed to collect data about the participants’ attitudes towards different accents and towards the speaker’s personality traits. The third section of the survey utilized direct technique to explore the attitudes and beliefs of participants about English language, ELF, ELF communication and identity and the items in this section were adopted from Czisier and Kontra (2012), DeMeerleer (2012), and Ke and Cahyani (2014). The fourth section was the demographics part, and it consisted of five different subsections: age, gender, home country, department and level at preparatory school for students; and for teachers the subsections were age, gender, home country, years of teaching experience and professional qualifications. The quantitative data gathered via the online survey were analysed with SPSS v.25, and the data for each section of the survey were categorized respectively.

# Discussion of Major Findings

Depending upon the overall results of the descriptive and inferential statistics, considerable assumptions could be made with regard to the flow experiences of EFL instructors in Turkey.

# Perceptions and Attitudes towards ELF & ELF Communication

According to the results of the analyses, it was found that majority of both the instructors and students agreed that there existed a standard English and regarded

American or British English as the standard version. This specific finding shows that although both groups in the study are aware of ELF, the dominance of the concept of standard and appropriate English is still valid for them, which directly contradicts with the nature of ELF. The results obtained from the students are also surprising, as they belong to a younger generation who uses English in various contexts, in academic, social or online communities, and thus they are exposed to many varieties different from the standard norms. As for the instructors’ results, the findings of this study align with the former research by İnceçay and Akyel (2014) and Sağlık-Okur (2016). Both previous studies asserted that although the teachers were aware of ELF, they were in favour of adhering to the standard English and not using ELF in their classroom practices. The researchers in those studies concluded that this could be the result of the teacher education program curriculum, which did not include ELF. Yet, in this present study, half of the instructors stated that ELF was covered in the program they graduated from and majority of them stated it should be included in the program. Hence, there is a need for further research investigating what standard English means to the EFL instructors and students, how it relates to their understanding of ELF and what can be done to integrate ELF and related content into classroom teaching and learning.

Moreover, both the instructors and students disagreed with the idea that the spread of English language in every field should be prevented. This finding shows that instructors and students are well aware of the spread of English language and its importance for communication in the current highly globalized world. This, again, is in parallel to the findings of the study by İnceçay and Akyel (2014), emphasizing the role of ELF in helping students and instructors use the language for communicative purposes in different contexts and build tolerance towards different varieties and widespread use in every field.

As for ELF communication and use, the findings indicated that majority of both the instructors and students were not bothered about the mistakes of other English learners or users made as long as they could communicate. This result complies with the view put forward by Promodou (2003), in which ELF is referred to as an instrument making it possible for people all around the world communicate in different contexts. Moreover, this result also supports Breiteneder’s (2009) assertion that the message to be conveyed is more important than the accuracy of the language in ELF communication.

# Ownership of Language

Regarding the ownership of English language, in the first section of the survey, the instructors mainly considered the native speakers (regardless of their nation) as the owners of English language. Similarly, the choice of the students was the native speakers for the same question. Yet, in the third section of the survey, more than half of the instructors and students agreed with the item stating English does not belong to native speakers any more, but anybody who uses it. This specific finding may indicate that although the instructors and students are aware of the widespread use of English or ELF and the importance of the effective use of language in different contexts, they have some contradicting opinions. In a simiar vein, as Bayyurt (2006) asserted, the materials, teaching and learning practices that the instructors and students were exposed to in their educational background may have highlighted the native speaker model as the owners of the language and thus represented the ideal forms. Hence, although they are aware of ELF and experience the use of English all over the world, they are still under the effect of the ideal native speaker model, owning the language and representing the ideal version and this may create a contradiction in their attitudes. Furthermore, the Turkish context may affect the perceptions of the instructors and students towards the ownership of language as English is taught and learned as a foreign language and native speakers are idealized. As Coşkun (2011) stated, their previous learning experiences, materials used in the classroom and what they have heard and experienced as an EFL speaker may have brought about this result in this study as well.

# Attitudes towards Different Accents and Pronunciation

The results obtained from the second section of the survey maintained that both groups (students and instructors) liked the native accents (American and British) more than the non-native ones (Turkish and Spanish). This result is in parallel with the findings of the study by Tsou and Chen (2014) in which the researchers concluded that non-native speakers had more positive attitudes towards native speaker accents, British or American. Moreover, in the present study, when the participants’ attitudes towards the speakers of different accents were examined, it was found that both groups had more positive attitudes towards the speakers of American and British accents rather than the non-native ones. These findings are in a similar vein with many studies common in the field. In the studies by Coupland and Bishop (2007) and Lev-Ari and Boaz (2010), it was asserted that native accents were favored more and the speakers of non-native accents were identified with negative characteristics. Similarly, as McKenzie (2010) maintained native accents were regarded as better than the non-native ones in terms of the speaker’s competence. In addition, the finding of the current study revealing the image of the native speaker model as being superior complies with the findings of the study by Kaur (2014). Kaur (2014) concluded that the speakers who represented native accents received

more positive evaluations or descriptions than the non-native ones. Hence, the findings of the present study towards different accents may well indicate that although the concept of ELF is valid for both the instructors and students, there is still a need to raise more awareness about the attitudes of both native speakers and non-native speakers towards non-native varieties.

Moreover, both groups in this study listened to the same fragment with American, British, Spanish and Turkish accents and the findings indicated that both the instructors and students liked the American accent most. With regard to the accent preference, the results of the present study are inconsistent with the findings of the study by Simon (2005), which asserted that tertiary level students considered British accent not the American one as the standard norm and liked it more. The preference of the participants of this study for the American accent may be explained with the view put forward by Zhang and Hu (2008) stating that learners or speakers of English tend do hold more positive stances towards the accents or varieties that they have been familiar with through exposure in their academic or personal lives.

In Turkish context, the findings of the studies by Yıldız (2017) and Kemaloğlu-Er (2017) are in parallel to the findings of the current study. Both previous studies put forward that tertiary level EFL students in Turkey favored native accents more and they had more positive evaluations regarding the speakers of these native accents. Similarly, the current study confirmed that tertiary level EFL instructors and students were more positive towards native accents and their speakers. Yet, the findings of the current study do not align with the study by Ranta (2010). Ranta (2010) asserted that the participants in the study held positive attitudes towards non-native accents as they were exposed to those accents in media and familiar with them.

However, in the third section of the survey, it was found both the instructors and students stated that as long as the meaning was clear the mistakes or pronunciation varieties did not matter for them. The results of this section again contradict with the findings that have been explained above. This can affirm the assumption that although the participants are conscious of the changing role of English and basic characteristics of ELF at a theoretical level; they are still biased against the varieties or forms different from the native ones and tend to see them as deficient when they literally come across them. These contradicting results comply with the findings of the study by DeMeerleer (2012) as similar contradicting results were obtained there. As DeMeerleer (2012) suggested, in comparable studies, native speakers generally tend to be associated with characteristics that are more positive. Thus, there may be a need for non-native speakers to become more aware of the inconsistency in their own beliefs, disguised or apparent. Such kind of an awareness raising may contribute to develop and reinforce tolerance and acceptance of nonnative accents as long as they communicate, which is directly linked with the basics of ELF understanding.

# Beliefs about English

When the overall findings of the current study are examined, it can be concluded that both the instructors and the students hold positive emotional and functional beliefs or views about English language. Majority of both groups agreed that English is a beautiful language and is one of the most important languages in today’s world. This result is important in confirming the view put forward by Arnold (2009) which emphasizes the significance of positive feelings or inclination in shaping the attitudes towards a language. In addition, as the participants of the current study were tertiary level instructors and students, it can be said that they

represented a group who are conscious of the instrumental function of English language. Thus, both groups in the study stated that English should be obligatory at universities and the students stated that English was important for their career. Thus, the findings of the present study are in line with the findings of the study by Pan and Block (2011) in which the researchers concluded that the teachers and students were aware of the importance of English both for communicative and academic purposes in Chinese context.

Moreover, the participants of the study were aware of the importance of English for international communication both with the native and non-native speakers. These results are in line with the findings of the study by Csizer and Kontra (2012), which confirmed that awareness of the instrumental value of English would add to a more clear understanding of ELF and its functional use in various contexts. Furthermore, coming to the understanding of English being used as a lingua franca in communication both with the native and non-native speakers may help construct a more thorough understanding of ELF and ELF communication in Turkish context.

# The Speaker’s Identity

As for the speaker’s identity, the findings of the present study showed that neither the instructors nor the students considered English as a threat to their native language. Furthermore, they were aware that English language was mainly important for international communication and speaking English makes them feel like a world citizen. These results support the findings of Sung (2013) and Ushioda (2013) and indicate the construction of a global identity as an ELF speaker.

The results also revealed that the participants were not disturbed when people recognized in their accent that they were not native speakers. This supports Booij’s (2001) claim that although speaking English gives the people the chance to get to

know other cultures and thus create a global identity, their mother tongue and its effect on their accent can be regarded as the reflection of their own culture and heritage and it is basically a reflection of who they are, thus an essential part of their own identity. Yet, contradicting with this result, the majority of both the instructors and students agreed that they would like to have a native-like accent. This contradiction once again revealed that the ideal native speaker model maintains its effect on EFL speakers and their identity construction. As Jenkins (2007) asserted, native speaker model or native accent is reflected as the ultimate point to be achieved for non-native speakers. Such kind of an approach confirms that there is a need to raise awareness both for the instructors and students that native speaker accent or accuracy should not be the ultimate aim for an ELF speaker.

# Limitations

As it is the case for many studies, this research study also has some limitations. The first limitation is that the data required for this study were collected via an online survey, so there is only quantitative data. Thus, the data are not enough to explore the attitudes of tertiary level EFL instructors and students in Turkey towards ELF, different accents and ownership of language in depth. The synthesis of quantitative and qualitative data would bring about more in-depth explanations and shed more light on the understanding of ELF in Turkey. Moreover, making use of semi-structured interviews would also yield more detailed and comprehensive results about the attitudes of EFL instructors and students towards ELF and different accents.

Another limitation is that the number of the participants, especially the number of the instructors, is not enough to draw generalizations. After the online survey link was sent to the instructors, 127 instructors started answering the survey questions. However, 49 of these participants did not finish the survey; since their answers were incomplete, they were removed from the data. Hence, the number of participants for the instructors fell to 78. Thus, the findings of the study cannot represent the attitudes of all instructors at the sample institution. Moreover, it is not possible to draw generalizations based on the findings as the study gathered the data via an online survey and in online surveys or questionnaires “the sample who respond are not representative of the population at large” (Moore, McCabe, & Craig, 2009, p. 199). As the study was conducted in only one institution, the findings may well differ across different contexts or settings. Lastly, the limited number of participants in some subgroups for research questions 6 (Which one below is considered as Standard English?, Turkish English $\scriptstyle 1 = 1$ ) and research question 7 (Which accent do you use while speaking English?, Othe ${ \tt c 7 }$ ), and thus the results of the ANOVA tests done with these groups can be regarded as another limitation of this research study.

# Implications for Practice

Based on the findings and limitations of the current study, some suggestions for further research can be made. First, as this study was conducted at only one state university, it can be replicated in Turkey including more than one university and thus more in-depth results can be obtained and a comparative analysis can be possible. Moreover, both state and private universities can be included to have a comparative analysis and draw detailed results. In addition, the study can be repeated in other countries to explore the understanding of ELF in different contexts and settings.

Furthermore, in terms of the research design, a qualitative or mixed method approach can also be adopted in future research. Such an approach and a longitudinal design would yield more detailed and explanatory results about the perceptions and attitudes of the EFL instructors and students towards ELF and different accents in Turkey and thus may contribute to the decision-making process in teaching and learning processes as a whole.

Future research can also focus on the relationship between the attitudes of EFL instructors towards ELF and their classroom practices. Through interviews, reflections and classroom observations, this relationship may be investigated indepth and concrete results about the teaching and learning process can be drawn.

# Conclusion

This quantitative study aimed to explore Turkish EFL (English as a foreign language) instructors’ and students’ perceptions on English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) and native and non-native accents of English. The study also aimed to find out how the EFL instructors and students see the position and ownership of English as a native language and as a lingua franca all over the world and their own use of ELF. The findings indicated that both the instructors and students were aware of ELF and widespread use of English at a theoretical level. Yet, as both groups favored native accents more and had more positive attitudes towards the speakers of native accents, it was concluded that they had some contradicting opinions and there was a need to raise more awareness on the practical use of ELF. In addition, both groups considered native speakers, regardless of their nation, as the owners of the English language, which was again contradicting with ELF. Moreover, the findings of the study revealed that both the instructors and students held positive beliefs about communicative function of English in the global world.

# MINDFULNESS

Have you ever driven somewhere and realised when you arrived that you couldn’t really remember anything about the journey? Or have you ever eaten a whole packet of biscuits when you were planning to only have one? Or have you stayed up much later than you planned, or even all night, watching ‘just one more’ episode of a TV series? All of these are examples of mindlessness. When we live this way, we are not fully awake and not fully living our lives.

What exactly is mindfulness?

When we are mindful, we are more conscious of our thoughts, our actions and what is happening around us. We might notice a beautiful sunset or really listen carefully to what a friend is saying, rather than planning what we’re going to say next. We are also more aware of our own feelings and our thoughts. Jon Kabat Zinn, who has done a lot to make mindfulness popular, says mindfulness is: ‘Paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment, and without judging.
